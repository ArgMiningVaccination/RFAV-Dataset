All NROTC National Scholarship selectees must complete (or have waived) New Student Indoctrination (NSI) the summer before reporting to their assigned NROTC Unit in order to be able to activate their scholarship. See Chap 3 Professional Development and th e Summer Training Manual for details on NSI. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 2-7 Note: Senior Colleges (i.e., VMI, Norwich, VPI, Texas A&M, and Citadel) were exempt from participation in NSI for Summer 2019 . However , NSI attendance applies to all national and 3 -year scholarship re cipients for YG20 24 and beyond. d. The PNS should consider a selectee's status against program requirements and standards . If a PNS determines that a scholarship selectee does not meet program standards and it is in the best interest of the Department of th e Navy to not activate the scholarship, the PNS shall contact NSTC N9 or MCRC immediately to discuss the case and the way ahead. Some of the conditions that fail to meet programs standards are, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Has not obtained the ir U.S. citizenship ; (2) Failure to maintain the level of academic performance shown in t heir scholarship application; (3) Failure to maintain the level of personal conduct shown i n their scholarship application; (4) Failure to report to the unit within service hei ght/weight or body fat standards; (5) Failure to pass initial physical readiness tests; and (6) Having any body piercings or tattoos that violate service regulations. e. If a scholarship is not activated for other than medical reasons within the first academic year after the stated scholarship offer start date listed in the selectee's scholarship notification letter , the scholarship offer will be rescinded prior to the start of the next academic year . The student will be notified in writing of the recession of the scholarship offer. f. If a student has been medically disqualified, denied a waiver and wishes to appeal that decision, they must provide new medical information that supports their appeal to D oDMERB. If a student is not medically qualified by September 30 in the academic year in which they graduate, the scholarship offer will be rescinded, and they may not be commissioned via the NROTC program . 2. Application/Placement a. Applications . In order to be considered for a National Scholarship, individuals apply via the NROTC website, http://www.nrotc.navy.mil/ , in coordination with a local Navy/Marine Corps recruiter and Candidate Guidance Officer (CGO) . If the individual meets the basic eligibility criteria in Section 2- 1, the applicant shall complete additional signature forms (drug and debarment statements, statement of understanding) , perform an Applicant Fitness Assessment, and are interviewed by an officer at the NROTC Unit . Completed Navy applications are forwarded to NSTC N92 Selection and Placement Office (signature forms mailed and application electronically released) . Completed Marine Corps applications are forwarded to the Marine Recruiting District. b. Selection s. Final scholarship selection decisions are made by Commander, Naval Service Training Command (CN STC) based on recommendations from a Continuous National Selection Board (CNSB) that convenes pursuant to a precept that lists selection criteria and the administrative process under which the board will operate . NSTC N92 conducts a series of selection boards each year for Navy Option and Navy Nurse Option scholarships . MCRC holds a selection board for Marine Option scholarships bi - annually in November (early board) and February (principal board). NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 2-8 c. Notification . NSTC N04 notifies Navy Option and Nurse Option applicants and MCRC notifies Marine Option. d. Medical Exam . Scholarship nomi nees must meet physical qualification standards . The data for those nominated for scholarship (both Navy and Marine Option) is loaded by NSTC N92 in the OPMIS NROTC Placement Form . From the data contained in the Placement Form, names and social security numbers ( SSNs ) are sent to DoDMERB to assist in the scheduling and completion of a physical examination . DoDMERB contractors are responsible for contacting nominees and scheduling an examination . DoDMERB determines if the nominees are qualified or disqua lified and notifies the nominees and NSTC N92. It is the nominees' responsibility to provide any additional medical information requested by DoDMERB and their failure to do so may result in their disqualification for a scholarship . The case files for nom inees who are found disqualified will be automatically forwarded by DoDMERB to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery ( BUMED ) for waiver recommendation . N04 will notify the nominees of the decision to waive or not to waive any disqualifying physical condition . If a nominee reports to an NROTC unit before being found physically qualified or before securing any needed waiver, the unit shall assist the student in completing the physical qualification process . Students may not be placed in scholarship status unt il found physically qualified or securing a waiver of any disqualifying condition . See Chapter 9 for further guidance. e. Final OPMIS Physical Code . In October of each year, the current year's placemen t file data must be transferred to a history file in order to get ready for the next year's group of scholarship nominees . After data transfer, unit personnel must enter the final physical code and approval date in the OPMIS Personal/Program Form. f. Placement . Once offered a scholarshi p, each selectee is placed at a n NROTC unit based on the desires of the individual (1st choice school in their application) . Students may request , in writing, a change of their choice of schools any time prior to sch ool start dates . Requests f or a school change may be de nied if the NROTC unit completed their orientation training . Units shall refer all requests for school changes or inquiries regarding unit vacancies to NSTC N92 via email to: pnsc_nrotc.placement@navy.mil . g. Unit Role in Placement (1) When the nominees' names appear on the OPMIS GF20R61 report, the NROTC unit shall send a welcome letter to the prospective nominees (see Section 4-5 ). This personal follo w-up promotes acceptance of the scholarship and also provides the nominee with information about the host institution and unit . All correspondence with nominees must st ate that the scholarship is contingent on being found physically qualified or receiving a waiver for any physical disability and admission into the academic institution listed on their application. (2) If a nominee is not accepted into the academic institution to which their scholarship is placed, units will update the \"school accept\" field in OPMIS at t he earliest opportunity . The nominees must be directed by the unit to inform NSTC N92 of their new choice of academic institution . Failure to do so will cause them to rema in on the database of the original unit, not appear on the database of their new choice of unit, and potentially cause them to lose the scholarship. h. Acceptance . Individuals who accept a scholarship, who are found physically quali fied or secure a waiver , and are admitted to the academic institution to which they are placed, are mailed letters of authorization by NSTC N92 to proceed to that academic institution and report to the PNS . A copy of this NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 2-9 letter is also provided to the un it. These letters will be mailed s tarting in August and continue until the end of October . After October, units shall send individual requests to N92 for a letter of authorization. i. Deferring Acceptance . Those who want to defer acceptance of the scholar ship shall immediately notify NSTC N92. Requests to defer come from the student via the NROTC unit to N92. Requests to defer scholarships are granted on a cas e-by-case basis. j. Active Duty Selectees . For active duty selectees, such as those from other services with conditional releases or those who applied prior to shipping to Recruit Training Command (RTC), NSTC N92 will request orders from the appropriate branch or notify RTC to issue a Standard Tran sfer Order (STO) . The current Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) identifies moves by active duty personnel to an NROTC unit as a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move . Travel shall be liquidated at PCS rates. k. Non-Active Duty Selectees . Non-active duty sel ectees make their own arrangements for transportation to NROTC unit s. Travel will be liquidated at the current temporary additional duty (TAD) rate per mile by Personally Owned Vehicle (POV) or the cost of a Government transportation ticket. l. Pending Physical Status . Individuals who accept a scholarship, have been admitted to the academic institution to which they have been placed, but who have not yet been found physically qualified or secured a waiver, may not be put on scholarship status . NSTC N9 will advise these individuals that they may proceed to campus and enroll in courses, but that they do so at their own risk and with no guarantee of scholarship or any other NROTC benefit until they are found physically qualified or a waiver is g iven. Tuition shall not be paid for such individual s, but u nit personnel may work with university bursar s' office s to arrange for delay s in tuition payment until the student s' status are known . Students pending final physical status shall obtain a statement from a physician stating they are physically fit to participate in physical activity before units allow them to participate in the physical requirements of orientation, Physical Readiness Test/Physical Fitness Test/Combat Fitness Test ( PFA/PFT/CFT ), or drills that require physical activity.

Becaus e of differences in students, their courses of study, and academic programs, both within and among institutions, a single, standard program of study is not feasible . Therefore, the PNS can structure the most effective program of study to meet indiv idual requirements . However, the PNS is responsible for meeting the instructional objectives specified in the curricula provided by NSTC N7 and for offering Naval Science C ourses in the recommended sequence . a. By public law, Title 10 United State s Code Section 2 102, the senior military officer assigned is given the academic rank of Professor . Each PNS is expected to function as an academic department head according to institutional policy . As it relates to Title 10, Section 2102, actions and decisions that affe ct the NROTC unit and the status of Nav al Science C ourses and accreditation shall be provided to NSTC Deputy Commander for NROTC , N04, in writing. b. The PNS structures and sets appropriate performance goals to achieve full academic potential and monitors the program of study to ensure each student meets Navy and university requirements for graduation and commissioning . NROTC instructors maintain appropriate degree plans, academic schedules, grade reports and checklists in a Student Performan ce File, as discussed in Chapter 6. NROTC instructors shall conduct academic counseling routinely and keep appropriate comments on file . NSTC expe cts NROTC students to progress and graduate in the minimum time possible consistent with their own abilities and the constraints of program structures and course offerings . Degree completion plans requiring less than a normal load (See 3 -5.3.) should be revised for an earlier graduation/commissioning date when possible . Satisfaction of both the institution's requirements for a baccala ureate degree and Navy requirements shall constitute the basis for a commission. 2. Course Accreditation . The PNS, as head of an academic department, shall establish academic accreditatio n procedures for Naval Science C ourses . These courses shall be accredited academically by the university on terms mutually agreeable to the Navy and the institution, regardless of whether degree credit is granted for each course. a. Credit Status Policy . Participating institutions shall review credit for NROTC courses on the same basis as other institutional courses, per established DoD policy . If an institution question s credit, the institution shall, in accordance with their agreement with SECNAV , recommend adjustments to make the course credit worthy . Regardless of the amount of credit awarded, NROTC course grades must appear on student transcripts . Institutions shall list all NROTC courses in institutional catalogs in the same manner as other institutional offerings . Each PNS shall continually seek to obtain the most favorable course status possible. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-3 b. Academic Excellence . As an academic department head, the PNS shall establish a learning environment conducive to achieving academic excellence . The NROTC unit shall maximize the use of the host university or colleg e learning facilities (such as reading, mathematics, science labora tories, tutorial assistance, etc.) . To raise performance in calculus and physics, the PNS shall , at the beginning of each term , require two hours of tutoring per week for scholarship students in these courses . This time includes: university tutoring programs, office hours with professors, teaching assista nts, military academic advisors, and tutoring provided by upper -class midshipmen who earned a \"B\" or higher in the course . The PN S may relax this requirement for a specific course once the student demonstrates satisfactory performance in that course . Section 8-13 provides guidance for funding of tutorial services. 3-4 Professional Development Responsibilities of Military Staff Staff Instructors . Each military staff member assigned to the NROTC unit is an instructor and advisor . Accordingly, the Navy charges each staff membe r with fulfilling the intent and objectives of the professional and academic aspects of NROTC programs . Advising and developing officers is the primary professional development task assigned to all members of the staff. 2. Instructor Responsibilities . The primary job of instructors is to advise students and, as such, portray an upstanding academic, professional, and personal deportmen t. Advisorship includes academic instruction, professional training, monitoring of progression in u niversity and Navy requir ements, counseling on academic, perso nal, and professional standards, and motivating students in preparation for careers in the n aval services . Using OPMIS 84 Report and NSTC forms 1533/115 and 1533/117 instructors shall: a. Acquire appropriate expertise in subject matter content for the courses assigned . Support other instructors and other courses with their p rofessional expertise as needed; b. Achieve and demonstrate competency in teaching methods and techniques of student evaluation . All officers ordered t o NROTC instructional duty shall attend the \"Teaching in Higher Education : NROTC Instructor Preparation Course\" en route to or within a few months of reporting. This Instructor Prep Course is held twice each year, Summer (traditionally, late July) and Winter (typically, mid - December) . Instructors reporting to units where schedules conflict with attending the next Instructor Prep Course will require waivers or postponements authorized by N9. The expectation is that instructors that have not completed thi s course will not be instructing courses at their unit. There is no substitute course. c. Provide formal, scheduled counseling and advising to NROTC students at a min imum of twice per academic term; d. Make themselves readily available to students during the normal working day . In all situations, the appropriate, confidential nature of personal and student information must be observed . The NROTC instructor shall use these counseling sessions and other situations to accomplish the foll owing officer advisor re sponsibilities: (1) Assist students in setting realistic academic performance goals, as well as overall academic planning and course scheduling; (2) Assist students in evaluating academic performance against goals; (3) Counsel students on term and cruise aptitude e valuation results; (4) Verify entries and ensure OPMIS student records are accurate and up -to-date; NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-4 (5) Closely monitor student performance on all NROTC Program requirements . Ensure calculus and physics requirements or mathematics and physical science requireme nts are met as appropriate; (6) Closely monitor performance in all professional requirements, including physical fitness, swimming , and body composition ; (7) Provide information on Naval Service career options and service assignment procedures; (8) Provide informat ion on NROTC regulations, student personnel administration, and NROTC Program requirements; (9) Act as a positive role model and representative of the Naval Service . Instructors are role models at all times and must maintain a professional relationship with the student s; (10) Maintain a Student Performance File containing detailed counseling/advising records and other information required by Chapter 6; (11) Prepare students for su mmer training and commissioning; and (12) Demonstrate and assist midshipmen with uniform standards, a ppropriate dress, and appearance; e. Perform all academic and institutional responsibilities to the highest standards of the teaching profession and be an active member of the faculty of the host university; f. Establish and use channels of communication with the appropriate NROTC Course Coordinator for exchange of cou rse information (see 3 -8.2); g. Maintain comprehensive academic course files that include updated lesson plans, instructional resource listings and academic records, includin g student grades and test files; h. Participate in NROTC Naval L aboratory sessions, as directed; i. Perform duties at summer training sites, in support of Summer Training Staff; j. Serve on unit boards and perform collateral duties, as assigned; k. Pursue intellectual and professional growth . While opportunities for this growth may include working toward another degree, this endeavor is not a primary duty . As such, taking graduate classes shall not preclude advis ing of students or participating in collateral duties, summer training assignments, and special programs . The PNS shall carefully consider all circumstances which may impact instructor availabi lity to the program or students; and l. Field questions from non -NROTC students inquiring about the NROTC Program and assist with applications, if necessary. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-5 3-5 NROTC Academic Program Requirements General . The NROTC Program groups commissioning requirements into academic and professional training categories . This section specifies the academic requirements . Professional training requirements are detailed later in this chapter. 2. Course Grading and Credit . Universities must offer all NROTC -speci fied courses and Naval Science Courses as a letter grade and not on a pass/fail grading basis, unless precluded by specific university policy . a. Courses taken for college credit prior to entering the NROTC Program (including Advanced Placement (AP) Courses or College Level Examination Program (CLEP) exam ) are acceptable so long as credit is awarded toward a baccalaureate degree by the host universi ty. In this case a letter grade is not required . Per paragraph 3 -6.1 below , students may not use this type of credit to fulfill both semesters (or quarter equivalents) of the requirement for calculus and physics; at least one semester/quarter each of calculus and physics must be taken in the university classroom environment for a letter grade . Higher level math like CALC III, Differential Equations, or Dynamics taken at the university count toward the calculus requirement. b. The host university must accept courses t aken at cross -town institutions for transcript credit with a letter grade (not pass/fail). c. Classes taken via distance learning (e.g., online, videotape ) are not acceptable for fulfilling the NROTC academic program, unless the host university accepts the c ourse for transcript credit with a letter grade . In no case shall NROTC units accept distance learning for calculus, physics, or Naval Science classes. 3. Academic Requirements . Students must complete academic requirements consisting of three parts: the institution's baccalaureate degree program with a selected academic major, NROTC -specified courses (offered by the i nstitution), and Naval Science C ourses . Normal loading for NROTC students shall be between 15 and 18 semester hours per term, including all NROT C-required course work . Normal length of degree programs is four years for midshipmen and MECEP officer candidates and no more than 36 months for STA -21 Officer C andidates. 4. Baccalaureate Degree Programs . The NROTC Program requires a bachelor's degr ee from an accredited institution for commissioning . During initial meetings with incoming students, the PNS shall discuss the need for technically competent officers to man the warfare communities of the Navy . The discussion shall include the service as signment process, including the positive consideration of technical prowess as demonstrated by a degree in a technical field . For non -technical majors, students shall be encouraged to pursue a field of study which is relevant to the Navy's needs for cultu ral knowledge and languages . All students shall pursue electives that are relevant to the Naval Services' need for culture, language, and business acumen. a. Scholarship and College Program (Navy Option) . PNSs shall encourage students to pursue majors in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 category, as well as language skills to meet the requirements of the modern Navy per NSTCINST 1533.3 (series ), Academic Major Selection Policy for Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) Navy Option Scholarship midshipmen, and NSTCINST 1550.1 series, Language Skills, Regional Expertis e and Cultural (LREC) Awareness Academic Major Policy for NROTC Midshipmen . Navy Option Scholarship midshipmen shall conform to the academic policy set forth in NSTCINST 1533.3 series . Navy Option Scholarship and College Program midshipmen must also compl ete the required Naval Science C ourses and the NROTC -specified college courses delineated later in this chapter . NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-6 Navy Option College Program students are not re quired to enroll in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 category major; however the PNS shall encourage midshipmen to pursue these majors and counsel them on the advantage of these majors when competing for a NROTC 2 - or 3-year scholarship. Items of note within the Tier instruction include: (1) NSTC N93 will co mmence an annual review of academic majors and tier assignments NLT 31 May; (2) Minimum 65% technical (i.e., Tier 1 and Tier 2) major graduates for Navy Option Scholarship midshipmen; (3) Specified Tier 1 academic majors include Aerospace (aeronautical or Astronautical) Engineering; Chemical Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Mechanical Marine/Naval Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Ocean Engineering; and Systems Engineering.

Specified r egions/cultural areas and languages available for study include Sub Sahara Africa, North Africa, Central Asia, East Asia/China, Middle/Central/Latin America, Middle East, Russia/ Eastern Europe, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Southwest Asia. Languages as sociated with these regions include Arabic, Cambodian, Chinese, French, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Kurdish, Malay, Pashto, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo -Croatian , Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Dari, Farsi, and Central Asian Languages. Note: French studies do not tend to qualify without supporting regional focus at the university. (6) Non-technical academic majors (Tier 3): All other academic majors not listed. Note: As names of majors occasionally change at universities, the required annual review conducted by the NROTC Curriculum Manager keeps the Tier structure specified in items 3 -5.4.a.(3) -(5) aligned to the instruction. (7) NROTC Navy Option College Program midshipmen are not required to enroll in a specific tier of majors; however, midshipmen are encouraged to pursue Tier 1 or Tier 2 majors to enhance their competitiveness for NROTC scholarship or Navy commission. (8) The NROTC Continuous National Selection Board draft precept and CNO guidance will include direction stating that not less than 85% of scholarship offers for incoming, Navy Option NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-7 Scholarship freshman must be assigned to Tier 1 or Tier 2 academic majors. The board report shall include specific academic major tier assignment for each selected scholarship candidate and alternate. (9) At the beginning of the sophomore year, the class should consist of a minimum of 80% technical majors. At the beginning of the junior year , the class should consist of a minimum of 75% technical majors. At the beginning of the senior year, the class should consist of a minimum of 70% technical majors. (10) The PNS may approve Tier 1 to Tier 2 , Tier 3 up to higher tiers, or within tier changes. The PNS notifies N93 of the change. (11) NSTC N9 will convene a panel to review midshipmen requests to transfer to Tier 3 academic majors. NSTC N93 will chair the panel. If there are no available Tier 3 quotas, the panel will review the midshipmen's request and consider for transfer to the College Program, Nurse Corps Program, or Marine Corps Program. If a change to Tier 3 is approved, the midshipmen must confirm with the student advisor that the tier change is still desired and have the student advisor con tact NSTC N93 (school admin) to enable the Tier 3 option in OPMIS. Note: NSTC N93 convenes these Tier Change Panels in June, December, and January (for Freshman to have results of first semester grades ). Additionally, req uests for Tier changes from Lang uage Skills, Regional Expertise, and Cultural Awareness (LREC) to non-LREC Tier 3 or from Tier 1 or 2 to LREC will also be reviewed by these boards IAW NSTCINST 1550.1E. Request for Tier Changes outside of these board times are discouraged as the need for a Tier Change should be anticipated a semester before it is necessary and requires submission as a unique request from a separate panel . b. Scholarship and College Programs (Marine Corps Option) . Although no restrictions exist on academic majors for Marine Corps Option students, the PNS, with the assistance of the Marine Officer Instructor (MOI), shall review proposed academic majors and guide the students to select their field of study in areas considered beneficial to the Marine Corps and to the individua l concerned for a career as a Marine Corps officer . In addition, the PNS and MOI shall assist students in selecting foreign language skills courses per NSTCINST 1550.1 (series ). When feasible, Marine Option students should consider completing the NROTC -specified courses (see Table 3-1), so that a change to Navy Option is not precluded by an academic burden. c. Nurse Option Program . Nurse Option S cholarship recipie nts must matriculate at an NROT C- affiliated school completing an NSTC -approved BSN . d. Marine Enlisted Commissioning Education Program (1) University Requirements . USMC requires MECEP students to complete specified university requirements for the approved major, plus specified professional development training as determined by the PNS to meet the pr e-commissioning training objectives established by the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

Students who have taken calculus or calculus -based physics for college credit prior to entering the NROTC P rogram, which their college has validated, must complete one add itional three semester -hour (or equivalent) college course in each of those areas to satisfy this requirement, unless th ese courses were taken at an NROTC affiliated school . This course shall be the second (or higher) in the sequence . Courses covered by this exception may include courses taken at other universities while in high school, AP examination credit, or university placement credit. e. Students shall complete calculus by the end of the second year of Naval Science (normally the sophomore year) and shall complete physics by the end of the third year of Naval Science (normally the junior year). To this end, students shall take a pre paratory math , calculus , or physics course each term at the discretion of the PNS until their calculus and physics requir ements are met. The PNS shall place students not completing this requirement (or failing to schedule these courses to ensure compliance) on academic LOA pending completion . The LOA shall begin at the first indication that th e student will not meet these requirements . For example: By the late fall semester, if a junior has not scheduled Physics II for completion in the spring, this student shall be p rocessed for LOA prior to the spring semester . In certain instances, NSTC N93 may grant a time -of-completion waiver. f. In rare instances a student may be authorized to take calculus and/or physics at another NROTC host institution or cross -town school during the summer at the student's expense . For example, a student enrolled at P urdue who lives in Norfolk, Virginia, may desire to take calculus at Old Dominion University during the summer . This should be the exception rather than the rule, and in all cases the calculus/physics course taken in this manner shall be one appearing on the N91 authorized list . The PNS may authorize course completion of this nature . In a case such as this transfer of credit and with a letter grade to the student's institution is NOT required. g. NSTC N91 cannot waive the requirement to complete calculus a nd physics. h. The PNS shall place students who fail calculus or physics a second time on academic LOA . Navy College Program Students . These students must complete one -year of college -level study in both mathematics and physical science as a prerequisite for commissioning. a.

Enrollment preference is given to NROTC students. 10. Naval Operations and Seamanship . This course is a continued study of relative motion, formation tactics, and ship employment . It includes i ntroductions to n aval operations and operations analysis, ship behavior and characteristics in maneuvering, applied aspects of ship handling, afloat communications, naval command and control, n aval warfare areas, and joint warfare . The course is supplemented with a review /analysis of case studies involving moral/ethical/leadership issues pertaining to the concepts listed above. 11. Leadership and Ethics . This course completes the final preparations of ensigns and second lieutenants for service in the Navy and Marine Corps . The course integrates an intellectual exploration of Western moral traditions and ethical philosophy with a variety of topics, such as milita ry leadership, core values, professional ethics, the UCMJ and Navy regulations, and discussions relating to the rol es of enlisted members, junior and senior officers, command relationships, and the conduct of warfare . The course provides midshipmen with a foundation of moral traditions, combined with a discussion of actual current and historical events in the USMC , to prepare them for the role and responsibilities of leadership in the Naval Service of the 21st century. 12. Naval Science Laboratory . The school normally recommends one semester -hour credit for the laboratory . The NROTC unit shall schedule Naval Science Laboratory for a two -hour period weekly each school term . Units may use the laboratory time to conduct clos e-order drill and professional education/training . Topics shall cover general Navy/Marine Corps mission and policies, force protection, operational security, watch standing, physical fitness, nutrition, stress management, and other professional development subjects not normally included in the c urriculum of the Naval Science C ourses . Laboratory periods may also be used on an occasional basis to supp lement the Naval Science Courses and provide additional time for projects, su ch as navigation chart work . The Naval Science Laboratory curriculum guide l ists the topics for the laboratory periods . 13. Strategic Sealift Midshipman Program Courses a. Intro to Naval Science (Freshman year) . The course introduces SSM to the organization of the Naval Service, varied career opportunities, long -held customs and traditions of the service, capabilities of the Navy, duties of a junior officer, and Navy polici es on relative wellness issues.

Instruction and Content . NSTC N7 develops and NSTC N9 approves curriculum guides for each Naval Science cours e. NSTC N7 will make the curriculum guides available to all instructors. (All Naval Science curriculum guides are available online. Contact N7 for access to DoDLearn. Note: DoDLearn contains education aids beyond the curriculum guide and a location for collaborative improvement of education aids for every Naval Science course through respective course coordinators.) The PNS is responsible for the instruc tion of these courses to ensure coverage of all PCCs, regardless of the amount of degree or course credit provided by the institution. Students must meet the learning objectives specified for each course in the respective curriculum guides. Team approach es to instruction are encouraged. In rare cases where the institution offers a course that is substantially equivalent to a Naval Science course, the PNS may permit substitution of that course with written approval from NSTC N9. In such cases, the PNS sh all ensure all relevant competencies and specified learning objectives are met, using Naval Laboratory sessions to cover material not otherwise addressed. In a similar manner, a Naval Science course that cannot be completed during the normal course schedu le (e.g., semester abroad, green - to-blue, direct conflict with degree completion) may be completed via directed study with written approval from N9. Such directed study courses must still appear on the student transcript or have an independent study waive r approved by N9 that documents coverage of PCCs taught in the course. 15. Adaptation for Quarters and Trimesters . Schools under the quarter system shall modify the credits for each course to a quarterly basis. For example, a three -credit semester course w ould be a five -credit quarter course based on the increased contact hours per week required to cover the material in the shorter time span of a quarter. Alternatively, a course may be divided over two quarters. 16. Accreditation Status and Reporting . NSTC N7 maintains records on the status of accreditation of Naval Science C ourses relative to university credit and acceptance for degree credit in various majors for all host institutions and cros s-town agreement institutions. a. Each October, units shall review the previous year's Course Credit Survey data, update the information indicating course credit, course sequencing, or other changes that have occurred and forward the revised survey to NSTC N7. Where no changes have occurred, negative reports are required . b. Unless a catalog is available on -line, annually, or upon revision, the PNS shall provide to NSTC N7 one copy of the undergraduate college/university catalogs/bulletins from the host institutions and other colleges and universities which have written cro ss-enrollment agreements. 17. NJROTC Credit . The PNS may exempt students having satisfactorily compl eted at least three years of naval science course work in the NJROTC or MCJROTC from Introduction to Naval Science. The PNS is not authorized any exemptions for NJROTC students who completed less th an three years of naval science in high school. 3-8 Curriculum Development and Revision General . The PCC Manual provide s policy guidelines for the professional development of NROTC students . Using the guidance provided by the PCC Manual, NSTC N9 prescribes course content , and NSTC N7 develops courses and procures necessary texts, references, training aids, and support material. 2. Course Coordinators . NSTC N9 designates specific NROTC units as Course Coordinators for each Naval Science course . The Course Coordinator role is a command responsibility . The PNS shall designate the unit instructor teaching the course the Course Coordinator Action Officer . Units so designated serve as a focal point of communication and information for NSTC N7 in reviewing, evaluating, and revising the course(s) assigned . Course Coordin ator Action Officers shall chair peer review and revision panels when assigned . Course Coordina tor Action Officers shall also serve on the NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-16 staff of the semi -annual Instructor Prep Course to train prospective instructors in course content and teaching comp etencies . Each Course Coordinator shall directly liaison with NSTC N7 and NROTC units for matters pertaining to the curriculum assigned . Similarly, all NROTC units are authorized direct liaison with the Course Coordinators . NSTC expects an active exchan ge of information and ideas . Naval Science Instructors may submit course revision recommendations to the Course Coordinator at any time. a. Other Officer Accession Programs . The Navy designates PCCs as the baseline for all Navy officer accession programs; hence, the basic core subjects are similar among these programs , creating the opportunity and the necessity for active interchange of thoughts and ideas and for the sharing of expertise . NSTC N7 and N9 (and the Course Coordinators as NSTC N9 representatives) shall maintain liaison with the United States Naval Academy ( USNA ) and other officer accession programs for this purpose. b. Navy Technical Activities . As appropriate, the resources of the various technical activities throughout the Navy shall be used to develop naval s cience instruction . NSTC N7 and N9 (and the Course Coordinators as NSTC N9 representatives) shall determine requirements and establish required liaison. c. Process . NSTC N7 shall develop and revise all Naval Science C ourses used in the NROTC Progra m. d. Although the courses are in a continuous state of review, NSTC N9 shall complete a comprehensive review of each course no less than once every four years in compliance with DoDI 1215.08 . e. The development and revision processes, anchored on the PCCs, use a systems approach to instructional analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation . Using the PCCs as a baseline, NSTC N7 develops and structures appropriate learning objectives and instructional strateg ies to achieve effective and efficient instruction. f. NSTC N9 manages curriculum updates and changes with assistance of Course Coordinators. g. In addition to the required quadrennial review, each Naval Science Course Coordinator shall continuously review the ir assigned course to identify needed updates and changes . Revisions may be made for any of the following reasons: (1) Modification of the PCC Manual ; (2) Desirability or necessity based on Course Coordinator/unit interaction approved by NSTC N9; (3) Revisions of prescribed texts and references; (4) Changes in technology, operational doctrine, command structure, etc.; (5) Direction from higher authority; or (6) Other appropriate indicators of the need for change. h. The Course Coordinator Action Officer manages the curriculum development process for the assigned PNS, in accordance with course revision guidance provided in Appendix C . Changes to curriculum shall be reviewed by a select group of subject matter experts determined by NSTC N7 and the NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-17 course coordinator PNS in a peer review manner . NSTC N9 directs the revision process but r elies on the PNS of the uni t, assigned in the Course Coordinator role to ensure content is relevant, current, and compliant with Navy policies. 3. Curricular Materials a. Curricula and Lesson Guides . NSTC N7 shall provide a curriculum guide for each Naval Science course and make the guides available online . Each curriculum guide contains course objectives, a listing of available instructional aids, the course bibliography, and lesson guides for each course t opic. Each lesson guide provides applicable learning objectives, a listing of instructor references and student texts, identification of applicable instructional aids, method and procedures options, and a detailed outline of the presentation of content . The lesson guide is the primary resource for the instructor to prepare individual lesson plans . Because of differing circumstances among NROTC schools, it may not be possible to teach each lesson as a specific unit of instr uction; however, instructors are accountable for meeting all learning objectives stated in the curriculum guides. b. Lesson Plans . Lesson plans shall be prepared by NROTC instructors for each class for the course(s) they teach . The lesson plan is prepared using the appropriate lesson gui de(s) , references, and the officer's education, professional training, personal experience, and instructional style . Although personalized, the lesson plans shall be systematically prepared to include statements of applicable lesson objectives, specificat ion of instructor and student resources, and a thorough and complete outline of the presentation . The basic format of the lesson guide is recommended for structuring lesson plans . Because teaching to the objectives defined in curriculum guides is a matter of accountability, instructional planning by instructors shall be reviewed during command self -inspections and by the NSTC N9 Command Assessment and Training Team (CATT) . Detailed and fully documented lesson planning is required to prom ote effective teaching and shall be provided to the relieving instructor as a part of the turnover from the departing instructo r. c. Text, Reference , and Instructional Support . NSTC N7 shall coordinate the distribution of student texts, instructor reference s, and instructional aids for each Naval Science course . Materials in the Navy supply system that are not provided by NSTC N7 shall be requested through the NETPDC N862c, Instructional Materials Supply Technician, using the Naval Logistics Library order f orm. If NETPEDC N862c is unable to procure the requested item, it should be ordered by stock number by the NROTC unit . Units will only be provided enough texts to cover expected enrollment of NROTC program students. This expected enrollment is based on commissioning class size plus 20% to allow for students taking the course out of the normal sequence. In cases where civilian students enroll in a Naval Science course, NROTC units may loan available texts to these students . However, this practice shall not create a demand for additional texts . Units shall ensure t he university will stock Naval Science textbooks required by civilian students for purchase at the university bookstore. d. Additional Instructional Resources . NSTC N7 shall provide and support only those texts, references , and instructional aids identified in approved Naval Science curriculum guides and supporting special informational programs directed by higher authority . Units may supplement these course materials, if so desired, but such pu rchases must be from the unit's Operating Target ( OPTAR ). These other materials of interest shall be brought to the attention of NSTC N7 and the applicable Course Coordinator for possible inclusion in the official curriculum. 3-9 Evaluation of NROTC Instructional Effectiveness The evaluation of instruction and instructional pr ograms is imperative . In the NROTC Program, evaluation occurs at both the NROTC unit and program -wide. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-18 NROTC Unit -Level Evaluation a. Measuring Achievement . The unit shall us e achievement tests to assess subject matter mastery and student competency . Instructors shall become competent in test construction and make full use of the techniques of test construction and validation . Course syllabi prepared by instructors shall spe cify the methods used for measuring student achievement and the frequency of such testing . The testing process shall be reviewed during command self -inspections and by the NSTC CATT . b. Evaluating Instruction . The PNS shall establish a system to evaluate the instruction provided by NROTC instructors . The PNS and the Executive Officer ( XO) shall each personally observe and evaluate each primary instructor for each Naval Science course at least once each term the course is taught . Utilized Example 3 -B to c onduct this observation. Multiple offerings of a course within a term (e.g. multiple sections, consortiums) which are taught by the same instructor are not considered separate courses. In addition, consortiums may divide observation between the PNS and X O, but they will observe each course at least once during each term in the consortium. Evaluation shall be in writing and maintained for the duration of the instructor's tour . Where the ins titution specifies a system of instructional evaluation, the PNS shall use, but not be limited by, that system. 2. Test Security . The PNS shall also develop clear -cut written guidelines for security of Naval Science tests and other sensitive instructional material . Instructors shall avoid overuse of the same test questions . Such materials shall be afforded a level of security similar to that provided for an enlisted advancement exam . Test material maintenance and security shall be reviewed during command self -inspections and by the NSTC Unit Assist Visit team. 3-10 NROTC Professional Training NROTC pr ofessional training includes the Naval Science Institute, Command and Leadership Training (CALT), Small Arms Training, S ummer Training, indoctrination field trips and visits , and physical readiness . Each of these is det ailed in paragraphs 3-11 through 3-17. 2. The NSTC High Risk Training Safety Program instruction (NSTCINST 1500.13A ), provide s additional requirements for some training and should be consulted when planning training with any level of elevated risk . Examples include : small arms training, physical readiness , and swimming . 3-11 Naval Science Institute (NSI) NSI is an intensive professional, academic, and physical training program conducted by NSTC at Officer Training Comman d, Newport RI . NSI provides STA -21 Officer Candidates a longer course of professional and academic training each summer . STA -21 academic work includes t he following six Naval Science C ourses: Introduct ion to Naval Science, Seapower and Maritime Affairs, Naval Ships Systems I (Engineering), Naval Ships Systems II (Weapons), Navigation, and Naval Operations and Seamanship. 3-12 Command and Leadership Training (CALT) In addition to the Naval Science C ourses listed, all NROTC midshipmen shall receive CALT . This training is structured to ensure midshipmen are able to demonstrate officer command and leadership qualities prior to commissioning . CALT places the midshipmen in settings that manifest conditions of stress, time management, personal accountability, management decision making, and command leaders hip. To the maximum extent practicable, CALT shall occur in settings that simulate an operational NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-19 unit. All midshipmen shall receive a minimum of 20 hours o f CALT training during each of their last two years prior to commissioning . This requirement is s eparate from participation in summer cruise and exposure to a range of CALT options is desirable . At a minimum, CALT shall include the options described belo w, with at least 10 hours per year being in one of the \"preferred\" options: Drill team (preferred); 2. Inter/intra -unit competitive military exercises (preferred); 3. Battalion management and administration; and 4. Planning and coordination of major battalion functions. 3-13 NROTC Small Arms Training Midshipmen and officer candidates are required to demonstrate proper handling and firing of small arms using current safety procedures. POCs are NSTC (series ) cover safety of small arms programs and must be complied with in administering this professional training. 2. Small Arms Training Requirements a. Caliber . Any small arms caliber may be used subject to range capability , but the 9mm pistol is preferred as it is the most universal small arm to which commissioned officers will be exposed . Note: Per DGM dated 29 Jan 1 8, CORTRAMID and Sea Trials will serve as the primary sources for midshipmen to obtain the Navy Small Arms Training and Qualificat ion. b. Instructors . NROTC Units will ensure midshipmen who did not receive small arms training through CORTRAMID or Sea Trials events meet the PCC requirement by contracting all aspects of the training (weapons, ammunition, range facility, etc.). If NROTC staff members conduct the training, all safety procedures and range qualifications listed in OPNAVINST 3591.1 (series ) shall be met prior to commencing training. c. Range . Range selection by the unit must be done with rigor and with safety as the foremost concern. Ranges to be considered include at military, law enforcement, university, and commercial ranges. Units may request assistance with range evaluation from NSTC Sa fety through N9. Note: If removing drill or ceremonial weapons from NROTC controlled spaces, it is advisable to notify university/campus police of the move where ceremonial weapons closely resemble operation small arms. On occasion, perception of these moves without notification has generated campus lockdowns. Coordinate with your host universit y for further guidance. 3. Command Responsibilities . The PNS is responsible for the safe conduct of small arms training and adherence to applicable Navy safety and security regulations and requirements . Most units are expected to be unable to maintain a qualified Range Safety Officer (RSO) due to the semi -annual requalification requirement. a. If the unit leads small arms firing, t he PNS shall a ppoint, in writing, a n RSO and alternate, as required for periods when the RSO is not present. 4. When assigned , the RSO or Alternate RSO shall : NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-20 a. Make certain all personnel involved in firing are knowledgeable of range safety procedures and requirements and the safe handling of weapons before allowing them to take part in live fire training . Unit-provided Primary and Alternate RSOs shall meet the qualifications and requirements set forth in reference OPNAVINST 3591.1 (series ); and b. Ensure that all range safety regulations are enforced during small arms training and that the instructo r-to-student ratios are in accordance with OPNAVINST 3591.1 (series ). 5. Units may seek alternate means than those listed above to safely and effectively accomplishing the small arms training , such as : a. Requiring students to participate in an appropriate university club or university course th at provides or supplements small arms training to meet PCC requirements; b. Using a n earby military rang e (to include those of other Services) to meet PCC requirements. Students may be issued no -cost TAD orders to the militar y range to conduct training; or c. Using s mall arms training conducted by USMC r ange staff during Marine week at CORTRAMID that meets or exceeds the PCC requirement. 6. Commands with m idshipmen not completing small arms training t hrough CORTRAMID or Sea Trials shall review these references : 1500.13 (series ), NSTCINST 1500.13 (series) and OPNAVINST 3591.1 (series ) before determining the most appropriate means of completing small arms training. The references contain useful guidance in running a safe small arms training progr am, place substantial restrictions on administering a program at NROTC units, and shall be considered. Once the PNS has determined the appropriate means of training, the PNS shall make an informed decision on the best method to achieve small arms training . 7. Midshipme n and officer candidates that do not meet the PCC requirements for small arms training require a waiver submitted by the PNS to N93. 8. Units are encouraged to review guidelines for the Government Purchase Card Program. Units may not purchase ammunition directly using the government purchase card. However, range services that include expending ammunition as part of instruction are deemed a valid purchase and are subject to the same contracting dollar value limitations as other purchases. Split purchases are not allowed. Questions may be directed to NSTC N8 . 9. NROTC midshipmen may be permitted to take advantage of additional training opportunities meeting the above guidelines. NSTC is not obligated to reimburse for ammun ition. Such training, when available, shall focus on achieving a service pistol weapons qualification in accordance with OPNAVINST 3591. 1 (series ) for all Navy students. 3-14 Summer Training General . A summer training period is held annua lly to furnish NROT C midshipmen the opportunity to gain experience in the practical application of their studies in Naval Science . These training periods range from two to six weeks in length with embedded cruise experiences three to four weeks in length . NROTC Scholarship midshipmen are required to participate in summer training during each of the three summers between freshman and senior years . The first class cruise shall not be waived. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-21 a. Fourth Class Summer Training. New Student Indoctrination (NSI) at Naval Station Great Lakes is a key component in the training cycle of a Midshipman and is a program requirement for participation in the NROTC program. The training event is normally conducted the summer prior to a midshipman candidate reporting to their respe ctive NROTC unit. Midshipman candidates who were unable to participate the summer leading up to their fourth class year will be required to complete NSI the following year or be disenrolled from the NROTC program at that time. Note: Senior Military Colle ges (i.e., VMI, Norwich, VPI, Texas A&M, and Citadel) were exempt from participation in NSI for Summer 2019 (i.e., YG2023) . However, NSI attendance applies to all national and 3 -year scholarship recipients for YG2024 and beyond. b. Third Class Summer Training . Normally c onducted between the freshman and sophomore academic years for all scholarship students who have completed NSI , Career Orientation and Training for Midshipmen (CORTRAMID) is warfare community indoctrination . Nurse Corps Option midship men do not attend CORTRAMID . The Nurse Corps third class cruise is at -sea training with the midshipmen assigned to the medical department of the ship . See Midshipman Summer Training Manual, NSTC -M 1533.5 (series) . c. Second Class Summer Training . Second Class Summer Training is cond ucted between the sophomore and junior academic years for all s cholarship students who have completed NSI . This a t-sea training on surface ships and submarines furnis hes midshipmen with basic shipboard orientation, an introduction to senior enlisted life , the Chief and division officer relationship and the roles of the work center supervisor . Sea Trials events fulfill the summer cruise requirement, but m idshipmen may request a second class cruis e in addition to Sea Trials . Second class midshipmen who completed NSI but did not participate in CORTRAMID as third class midshipmen may do so in lieu of second class cruise if billets are available . Second Class Midshipmen who did not complete NSI shall participate in Sea Trials in lieu of NSI and CORTRAMID. Nurse Corps Option midshipmen who did not attend third class cruise shall participate in the second class at -sea training . Marine Option midshipmen sha ll attend an amphibious cruise or embed with USMC units . d. First Class Summer Training . First Class Summer Training is conducted between the junior and senior academic years for all first class NROTC midshipmen . First class cruise provides exposure to the officer and wardroom environment and is executed in an at -sea training environment aboa rd a ship . First class Navy Option midshipmen may also opt for aviation, submarine , or Foreign Exchange Training for Midshipmen (FOREXTRAMID) . When practicable the type of cruise should be aligned with anticipated designator . Marine Option first class midshipmen attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Quantico, VA. Marine Option midshipmen shall also be required to sign an OCS Statement of Understanding prior to reporting to OCS . This statement is generally signed when the student selects Marine Opti on. The Nurse Corps Opt ion first class cruise is at a n aval hospital, with the primary training objec tive to learn the organizationa l structure and functions of a n aval hospital and to gain appreciation for the concept of Navy healthcare . Midshipmen unab le to complete their First Class cruise during the summer training period will require postponement, see paragraph 3 below, and cannot commission until the cruise is accomplished. 2. Eligibility for Summer Trainin g. To be eligible for Third, Second, and First Class S ummer Training , midshipmen must be on s cholarship or Advanced S tanding, meet the physical fitness and body composition standards of Section 3-20, and cannot be on LOA . Due to the physically demanding nature , OCS carries a minimum PFT score recommendation of 2 65. The PNS may waive the physical fitness standards for Third and Second Class cruise s only to the extent given in Table 3 -3. The physical fitness standard may not be waived for midshipmen attending OCS. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-22 Note: Units are responsible for conducting official PFAs listed in Table 3 -3. Inventory PFAs conducted at CORTRAMID will not preclude training but can place a midshipman on FEP during CORTRAMID. Table 3-3 Summer Cruise Physical Fitness/Readiness Requirements Cruise Fitness Level USMC PFT SCORE USN PFA Score CORTRAMID Recommended - - Standard 200 Good Low (20-24) Min Waiverable Per PNS Satisfactory 2nd Class Recommended - - Standard 235 Good Low (20-24) Min Waiverable 220 Satisfactory 1st Class Recommended 265 - Standard 235 Good Low (20-24) Min Waiverable No Waivers n/a a. Scholarship Midshipmen . For Scholarship Program students, th e timing of the appointment to Scholarship status determines the requirement for participation in summer training . All 4 -year NROTC Scholarship students should participate each summer . Those appointed to 3-year scholarships are eligib le to cruise following completion of NSI and at least one semester on scholarship; however, sprin g-start Scholarship midshipmen are space -available only in the first summer, by special request from the unit to NSTC N73. Three-year s cholarship recipients , following completion of NSI, may participate in CORTRAMID or Second Class cruise and First Class summer training periods, or OCS for Marine Option midshipmen . One-year and t wo-year scholarship recipients shall participate in first class summer training only upon completion of NSI or Sea Trials . b. College Program Midshipmen . Each NROTC College Program Advanced Standing student is required to participate in the first class cruise following completion of NSI or Sea Trials . College Program students shall no t participate in Third or Second Class summer training. c. SSM . SSM expressing a strong interest in active Naval Service following graduation are eligible to participate in at -sea cruises similar to those of NROTC midshipmen . However, as they are not NROTC midshipmen, they are ineligible for NROTC Program funding and generally pay all expenses out-of-pocket, including transportation, lodging, and meals . SSM shall request at -sea cruises via NSTC N73. d. STA -21. STA -21 Officer Candidates do not participate in summer training and are required to maintain ful l-time academic study during the summer term. e. MECEP . MECEP Officer Candidates are required to complete Marine OCS at Quantico prior to reporting to the NROTC unit. 3. Waivers and Postponements . Summer training is required of all NROTC Scholarship midshipmen during each summer between the freshman and senior years . N04 may waive Third and Second Class cruises for eligible midshipmen in special cases . Waivers are not appropriate for midshipmen found to be ineligible; document the cause in the midshipman's record . Where CORTRAMID or Nurse afloat cruis es are waived following the freshman year, they can be completed, as space permits, following the sophomore year . Since the First Class cruise sat isfies the USC 10 (Title 10) commissioning requirement NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-23 for all NROTC midshipmen, it can be postponed but not waived . Midshipmen postponing their First Class cruise may be required to complete their First Class cruise AFTER graduation but PRIOR to commissi oning . Requests for waivers and/or postponements shall be considered by NSTC N73 beginning in March and forwarded to the N04 for approval . Midshipmen with post -commissioning ship assignments shall not cruise on their assigned ship. 4. Academic Year Cruises a. Academic year cruises are provided only for graduates unable to complete cruise during their First Class Summer Training . As the December break timeframe is usual ly not sufficient for fleet training due to holiday stan d-down, academic year cruises are available on a limited basis . PNS shall submit requests for academic year cruises to NSTC N73 in accordance with the annua lly-published Acade mic Year Cruise Official Mail M essage . b. Submarine orientation cruises are available on a limited basis during t he academic year for those individuals considering submarines for service assignment and are coordinated by NSTC N91. 5. Regulations . NROTC Scholarship and College Program Advanced Standing midshipmen are on active duty orders during summer cruise and are, therefore, subject to all laws and regulation s of the U.S . Naval Service, including pertinent ship or station orders, special cruise or training regulations, and the UCMJ. However, in accordance with JAGINST 5800.7 (series ), article 0106, non -judicial pun ishment is not authorized for midshipmen. Consult the NSTC Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) regarding any UCMJ violations committed by any midshipman during summer training. Note : While Project Go opportunities are highly desirable (to include substitution for the World Culture and Regional Studies course requirement) and provide strategic language training for DoD, these are not technically summer training ; thus , midshipmen are not on active duty during these events , and a waiver is required when Project Go interferes with summer cruise. Expect such waivers for Project Go to be granted by N04 unless t his interferes with a commissioning requirement. 6. Preparation of Midshipmen . The unit staff shall thoroughly prepare midshipmen for cruise . As this may be the first time these young adults have traveled outside their local regions, particular care must be paid to ensure their safety . Providing midshipmen with \"life lines\" (i.e., phone numbers and points of contact both at the destination and at the unit) is one key element of this preparation . The following summer training governing instructions are updated annu ally and are available on the NROTC website http://www.nrotc.na vy.mil/ : a. Midshipman Summer and e. NSTCNOTE 1530 . 3-15 Sail Training Units are not required to maintain a sail program and will not be funded to do so. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-24 3-16 Indoctrination Field Trips and Visits General . The professional training of NROTC studen ts extends beyond the study of naval s cience on campus and summer training . This important aspect of training takes on a variety of for ms as allowed by available opportunities . Visits to Navy and Marine Corps bases, surface ships, submarine s, and aviation indoctrination visits are typical events that contribute to motivating and prepa ring students for future Naval Service. 2. Scheduling of Field Trips and Vis its. PNS requests shall b e addressed to the appropriate F leet commander, training command, or designated representative, with information copies to NSTC N93. Because of the time involved in coordination of unit travel, early submission of requests is ess ential. a. The PNS shall request a viation indoctrination visits through the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA (N3)) and the respective aviation type commander for visits involving any flying activities , providing infor mation copies of all correspondence to NSTC N93. b. The PNS shall request for nuclear submarine indoctrination field trips through the appropr iate commander geographically closest to the unit , provid ing information copies of correspondence to the respective type commander and NSTC N91. c. The PNS shall r equest surface ship indoctrination field trips through the appropriate commander , providing information copies of all correspondence to the respective surface force type commander and NSTC N93. d. Units shall coordinate visits to Marine Corps bases . Instructions for these visits are published in an annual MARADMIN. 3. Faculty Participation . In an effort to increase the value of indoctrination field trip s and visits, units are encouraged t o authorize participation of a limited number of faculty members, in addition to NROTC midshipmen and staff . This participation shall be on a space -available basis and per Management of Department of the Navy Airlift Assets , OPNAVINST 4631.2 (series ), Public Affairs Policy and Regulations, SECNAVINST 5720.44 (series ), and guidance provided by NSTC and NETC . Release from claim of injury is required for each no n-NROTC student not otherwise entitled to spac e-available travel under the provisions of OPNAVINST 4631.2 (series ). 4. Special Provisions . Indoctrination field trips and visits are separate and distinct from \"ann ual training duty\" and do not constitute \"active duty for training\" as defined in the Servicemen's and Veterans' \"Survivor's Benefits Act,\" even though these may, in rare cases, be of more than 14 days in duration. Such field trips and visits are provided for by Section 2109, USC 10 (Title 10) . Section 8140, USC 5 extends the death and disability entitlement of Subchapter 1, Chapter 81, USC 5 to such persons with certain limitations. 5. NROTC Student Orders . To provide an official status, NROTC students participating in field trips, visits, orientation pr ograms, and unit -sponsored events, including overnight training, the unit shall issue appropriate orders for each period of participation . a. Unfunded (no -cost) orders are generally appropriate and may be issued at the unit's discretion using the De fense Travel System (DTS) (or a completed DD Form 1610 outside DTS) . NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-25 b. Funded orders may only be issued with NSTC N9's approval, and only for events to improve professional knowledge . Funded orders shall be issued through DTS. 6. Operational Risk Management (ORM ). PNSs must conduct a formal, written ORM assessment for any field trip, visit, orientation, etc . Training Time Out (TTO) m ay not be part of some visited units' operational min d-set, so NROTC units must ensure, before the visit, that TTO procedures shall be followed for midshipmen. 3-17 Physical Readiness/Fitness Training General a. Physical fitness is a crucial element of mission performance and must be part of every midshipman's life . Mission readiness and operational effectiveness are built on the physical fitness of the individual; therefore, all NROTC students and military personnel shall maintain personal fitness by regular exercise and proper nutrition. b. The principal goal of the Physical Readiness/Fitness Program is to create a culture of fitness to enhance a member's ability to complete tasks that support the comman d's mission . The NROTC unit PNS shall safely and effectively integrate physical readiness activities into the training program. c. The Physical Fitness Assessment/Physical Fit ness Test /Combat Fitness Test (PFA/PFT /CFT ) includes a Body Composition Assessment (BCA) and Readiness Test (PRT) . BCA for midshipmen is height/ weight standards or body circumference measurements , if necessary (i.e., no single - site abdominal circumference measurement from NAVADMIN 178/15) . BCA for active duty personnel (Officer Candidates) will include single -site abdominal circumference measurement, if necessary. The PRT consists of curl -ups, push -ups, and either run or swim . The Marine PF T consists of crunches or plank , pull-ups or push -ups, and a three -mile run . The Marine CFT consists of three events: Movement To Contact (MTC), Ammunition Lift (AL) and Maneuver Under Fire (MANUF). d. All students are required to meet the standards set forth in this manual . Members who are unable to meet PFA/PFT /CFT standards shall be subject to administrative action . The PNS shall recognize members who make significant improvements in physical fitnes s or consistently score excellent or better through comments on fitness reports, evaluations, and other incentive awards. 2. Command Physical Fitness and Conditioning Administration a. Background . As potential future Naval O fficers, the unit must indoctrinate students in a healthy and fit lifestyle congruent with military service . The professional development of students assigned to NROTC units shall include physical conditioning to meet military requirements . (See Appendix B.) (1) Guidance from thi s chapter, along with OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ), the 21st Century Sailor portion of the Navy Personnel Command website, and MCO 6100.13A , shall assist to safely and effectively administer a unit's physical training program. (2) Providing student guidance on elements of physical training programs (e.g., proper hydration, warm-up, cool -down ), enhances the safety of physical training . Guidance does not negate the need to conduct an ORM assessment prior to each and every physical training session . The risk fact ors to be assessed shall include the particular requirements of the unit, with emphasis on location, climate, season, weather, and the purpose of the event being conducted. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-26 b. Student Initial Physical Condition . When students report to the unit, li ttle is known of their physical capabilities . Students may be reporting to a geographic or climatic region that is dramatically different from their home of record . For these reasons, a conditioning program based on sound physiological principles and tai lored to meet individual needs from pre -entry through commissioning is required. c. Responsibilities . Responsibilities are described in OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ), MCO 6100.13A , and in the Navy Recruiting Command Fitness and Nutrition Guide (NRCFNG) . The NRCFNG pre-entry plan can be found on the NROTC website https://www.nrotc.navy.mil/faq.html . Additional responsibilities are provided in the following paragraphs. (1) NSTC N9. Physical conditioning congruent with military service shall start at or before selection for an NROTC scholarship . Selectees shall be notified of military height/weight and physical fitness standards . In addition, all selectees shall be directed to the N RCFNG , in preparation for meeting Navy or Marine Corps physical training requirements . The NROTC website contains a pre -entry plan with the up -to-date standards for the PFA . For references to Marine Corps fitness standards, see MCO 6100.13A . (2) NROTC Units shall: (a) Ensure all medically -qualified personnel meet or surpass a ll physical readiness standards; (b) Provide, via welcome letters/packages, a second notification of Navy or Marine height/weight and physical fitness standards, along with information on the N RCFNG and the planned dates of the initial and official PFA/PFT /CFT ; (c) Conduct at least one inventory PFA/PFT one to three months prior to each official PFA/PFT . The inventory PFA/PFT provides the individual students the opportunity to gauge their level of conditioning and physical readiness prior to an official PFA/PFT . The PNS may waive students with demonstrated superior physical readiness from an inventory PFA/PFT. The inventory PFA/PFT may also indicate a need to assign a Fitness Enhancement Program ( FEP). Additional physical fitness tests may be administered at the PNS' discretion to facilitate the monitoring of students . Note: PFA/PFTs conducted at COR TRAMID are not official and, therefore, may not be u sed for placing students on LOA or making a disenrollment recommendation; (d) Provide information and activities to assist students in achieving physical fitness standards . Unit directed activities to meet this requirement should not occur more than three times per week; (e) Conduct an official fitness e valuation in compliance with OPNAV INST 6110.1 (series ) and MCO 6100 .13A twice per year with the tests at least four months apart . Navy Option midshipmen shall be given the PFA twice, while Marine Option midshipmen are given the PFT in the first half of the calendar year and the CFT in the second half; and (f) Develop and implement a FEP that meets the needs of all personnel striving for improved fitness, not simply those who do not meet standards . FEP plans may direct activity more than three times per wee k. The FEP must be designed to increase and maintain cardio respiratory fitness, muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility, reduce excess body fat, promote year -round fitness and health, and provide nutrition al guidance. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-27 (3) NROTC CO. The CO has overall responsibility for the physical training program . At a minimum, the CO shall: (a) Ensure all physical training complies with NSTCINST 1500.13 (series ); (b) Brief the NROTC staff on the proper conduct of the Navy PFA and the Marine PFT /CFT , along with guidance outlined in the chapter; (c) Monitor the overall physical fitness of students through the implementation of a safe and effective yea r-round physical conditioning program; (d) Reinforce the importance of a year -round physical conditioning program for all students prior to extended periods of absence from the unit; and (e) Appoint a Command Fitness Leader (CFL) to administer the physical conditioning program as outlined in Navy and Marine Corps directives. (4) Command Fitness Leader . The CFL designs and directs unit physical training in accordance with Navy and Marine requirements . The CFL shall: (a) Obtain prescribed training for CFLs outlined in OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ); (b) Consider principles of acclimation, injury prevention, safety, and exercise physiology in designing physical training; (c) Require presence of an AED prior to commencement of all physical training (for outdoor runs, the AED will be carried in a vehicle or pack ); (d) Report all student physical training injuries requiring medical intervention (beyond immediate first aid) per OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) and MCO 6100.13A to the NSTC Safety Manager; and (e) Ensure midshipmen obtain a qualified or waived status on their DoDMERB physical . If not qualified or waived prior to the start of the first unit -directed physical conditioning session, the midshipmen must submit a recent ( notionally 90 days) civilian sports physical to the CFL . Under no circumstances shall unit -directed physical training ( PT) commence without proper documentation of a p hysical examination . The unit requirements must meet or exceed academic institution requirements for physical training programs (e.g., intramural sports). Note: Satisfactory completion of NSI during the summer before fall term shall be considered suffic ient to meet the 90 day currency on sports physicals and avoid duplicate sports physicals for entry into the NROTC program as long as no positive screening questions appear on the PARFQ and Annual Certification of Medical Status . (5) Academic Advisor . The academic advisor shall incorporate a review of physical conditioning into the regularly scheduled professional development advising sessions . A review of the student's progress on physical conditioning can be validated through personal logs, observed performance, and PFA results . These sessions provide an opportunity to document performance progression. (6) Students . While t he NROTC Program pr ovide s information and activities to assist students in achieving physical fitness standards , it is the responsibility of students to: NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-28 (a) Participate in the unit physical conditioning program and maintain an adequate personal PT program to meet physical fitn ess standards; (b) Develop and maintain a lifestyle that promotes optimal health and physical conditioning; and (c) Report injuries or illnesses that limit participation in physical conditioning or individual physical activities at the first available opportunit y to the CFL or unit staff . Reporting mechanisms inclu de verbal notification to a unit staff member and the Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire (PARFQ ). d. Action . NROTC unit PNSs/OICs shall ensure completion of the following in the exec ution of their PT programs: (1) Ensure the CFL has e ach student complete a yearly Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire ( PARFQ ) prior to starting unit -directed PT . Any affirmative responses require evaluation by a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or Navy Independent Duty Corpsman prior to initiating PT, and the PNS's si gnature. The CFL must also have each student complete an Annual Certificates of Physical Co ndition, NSTC 1533/107 (refer to Section 9-10). Note: The NSTC 1533/107 is required in each subsequent year (even for college programmers that had a valid sports physical in the initial year) ; (2) Ensure completion of a DoDMERB physical indicating the status of physically \"qualified (Q)\" or \"waived (W)\" for each midshipman participating in PT. If a midshipman does not have a DoDMERB status of waived or qualified, a sports physical must be completed no earlier than 90 days prior to the first unit PT session . Under no circumstances shall PT commence without proper document ation of a physical examination; (3) Conduct ORM prior to every PT session . Risk factors to be assessed a nd mitigated shal l include but not be limited to safety, conditions (such as terrain and environment, weather, emergency provisions, and emergency actions plans with contact phone numbers. Care should be taken when running or training in wet or slippery c onditions . Use heat and wind chill index charts (such as that found on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website at www.nws.noaa.gov/om/windchill/index.shtml ); (4) Conduct tra ining on wellness and safety topics per OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ). These topics can be found in NROTC's Naval Science Laboratory Curriculum Guide, OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ), and the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center (NMCPHC) website at https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Pages/Home.aspx . Ensure a TTO brief is conducted prior to every unit -directed PT session . This brief shall include demonstrations of the standard signals used to identify a person in trouble or who requests a TTO. Signs of impending distress and the need for honest self-reporting shall be reviewed with all students and staff semi -annually. PFA/PFT /CFT standards shall be reviewed with all students and staff at the beginning of each term and prior to official PFA. Training on acclimation/hydration shall be conducted annu ally, at the beginning of the fall term. First aid procedures shall be reviewed semi -annually. Nutrition shall be discussed annually; (5) Conduct a n assessment of a new student's physical condition at matriculation or new student orientation by assessing st ated pre -entry level of conditioning (running) using NRCFNG Program stages, conducting a pressure -free, off -record trial PFA/PFT, and c omparing the NRCFNG stage and trial PFA/PFT run time to develop an individual conditioning program utilizing the NRCFNG Pre-Entry NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-29 Physical Training Plan as a general guide . The NRCFNG website contains a pre -entry plan with the up - to-date standards for the PFA . The NRCFNG pre-entry plan ca n be found on the NROTC website; (6) Incorporate the following into unit PT sessions : (a) Direct staff supervision at all unit -sponsored/directed PT sessions, to include swim qualifications . Personnel other than u nit staff are prohibited from independently conducting or supervising unit PT. Unit PT is for officer candidates and midshipmen stu dents (Navy Baccalaureate Degree Completion Program (BDCP) and Marine Platoon Leaders Course (PLC) members may participate with a signed hold harmless agreement ); (b) Adequate hydration through replenishment of lost fluids; (c) A 5-minute warm -up, 5 -10 minutes o f stretching, aerobic or muscular endurance activity appropriate to the level of the individual, 5 minutes of cool down and 5-10 minutes of stretching; (d) Up to three unit -directed PT sessions per week as part of an individual fitness plan to ensure an appropriate fitness level . In special circumstances, when approved by the CFL, an individualized training plan may include more than three unit -directed PT sessions, such as FEP. (e) FEP s hall be separat e from general unit -directed PT; and (f) Sound ORM and physical training practices at all times . (7) Encourage all students to participate in the FEP to improve their physical conditioning and maintain established standards . If needed, and appro ved by the CFL, an individualized training plan may include more than three unit -directed PT sessions. (a) Participation in FEP is required when a student does not meet the physical fitness or body composition standards given in section 3-20 . (b) Students shall not be released from required participation in the FEP until they meet both the physical fitness a nd body composition standards given in section 3-20 for a monthly mock PFA or an official PFA . 3. Administration and Testing a. Physical Fitnes s Testing (1) Each student shall be required to take the Navy PFA twice or Marine Corps PFT and CFT each academic year, with the tests at least four months apart . Retesting procedures are detailed in OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) and MCO 6100.13A ; in addition, units shall document each PFA/PFT /CFT test on the evaluation and counseling reports . The results of each official test shall be noted in the OPMIS student file and block 7a of the Evaluation Report and Counseling Record (NAVPERS 1610/2) . Score s impact block 35 ratings as well (see S ection 6-5 , paragraph 6.c.) (2) Units are encouraged to provide suitable recognition to students who demonstrate exceptional progress or achievement in the physical fitness program (e.g., for those achieving an Outstanding; 285 for Marines). NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-30 (3) The unit shall ensure that all scholarship midshipmen have an OPMIS physical status code of \"Q\" (Qualified) or \"W\" (Waiverable) prior to the PFA/PFT /CFT . Any midshipman with a physical status code of \"D\" (Disqualified) or \"R\" (Remedial) cannot take the PFA without a sports physical stating the student is physically qualified to participate . College Program Basic Standing students must provide a sports physical stating t he student is physically qualified to participate in the PFA/PFT /CFT . (4) The PNS must refer students with positive answers on the Risk Factor Screening Questionnaire to a physician, adult nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or Independent Duty Corpsman for medical clearance . b. Swimming (1) Swim tests shall be given to all first -term NROTC students . Entering students failing to qualify as swimmer 3rd class shall be required to obtain qualified swim instruction , typically from a third party . Swim Test Administrator qualification is not sufficient to provide swim instruction. The results of the swimming test shall be noted in their Fitness Report and Counseling Record. (2) Units without university swimming facilities available shall arrange for s uitable public or private facilities . If necessary, funds shall be requested from NSTC N9 in the annual budget call. (3) Any unit -directed swimming events, including those associated with the PFA and with 2nd and 3rd class swim tests, require at least one st aff member and as many qualified lifeguards as necessary to ensure a safe studen t-to-lifeguard ratio, as outlined in NETC Swim Manual P 1552/16 (series ) and NSTCINST 1500.13A . The Record of Swim Qualification is used to assist swim -test administrators. Note: Swim Test Administrators are not conducting a course /specific class; thus, High Risk Medical Screening forms are not required to administer swim tests. Participants shall comply with medical screening requirements for participation in all physical train ing, the medical screening includes the annual periodic health assessment (PHA), a semi -annual NAVPERS 6110/3 Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionnaire ( PARFQ ), and pre -physical activity questions (e.g., Do you have chest pain (with or without exertion), bone or joint pain, high blood pressure or high cholesterol?; Have you had a change in your medical status since the last time you were as ked these questions?; Are you ill today or know of any medical condition that may prevent you from participating in physical activity today?; etc...) . Members who respond \"yes\" to one or more of the pre -physical activity questions (except the question on PH A currency ) shall be referred to a physician, adult nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or Independent Duty Corpsman for medica l clearance. 3-18 Academic Standards of Midshipman Performance PNSs shall encourage their midshipmen to work to the limits of their individual potential in whatever endeavors they may undertake, including academics . Sound academic foundations are necessary to ensure that NROTC graduates can satisfactorily complete Navy pos t-accession training and be professionally competitive in the various warfare communities . To maximize the opportunity to achieve these important standards, the PNS may direct mandatory study, not to exceed 15 hours per week. Academic Standards . To ensure NROTC graduates are properly prepared academically, ea ch student shall meet the following standards: a. Have no failing grade in any subject required for completion of degree or commissioning requirements; NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-31 b. Maintain a cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale of 2. 5 for midshipmen , MECEPs, and STA -21 OCs , or 3.0 for STA -21 Nuclear and CEC Options; midshipmen who entered the ir current NROTC program prior to July 2016 are grandfathered and remain under the 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA standard. Program members executing new agreements (e.g. accepting a schola rship or advanced standing) must adhere to the new standard; c. A term GPA of 2.5 for midshipmen, MECEP, and STA -21 OCs, or 3.0 for STA -21 Nuclear and CEC Options.; university's School of Nursing admission standards, but not less than 2. 5 on a 4.0 s cale; d. Maintain satisfactory overall progress toward completion of degree requirements within established program time limits while maintaining full -time student status per institution regulations; and e. Keep their NROTC class advisors fully informed about all matters pertaining to performance, degree progres s, and changes to their degree completion program. Waivers . NSTC N9 may waive specific courses or requirements when academic or professional work has been achieved that substantial ly and clearly meets all course requirements for which a waiver is requested. Academic Deficiencies . a. Academic deficiency is defined as failure to comply with one or more of the standards addressed in this chapter . Administrative procedures for academic deficiencies are addressed in Chapter 6. Appendix B provides guidelines. b. An academic deficiency exists when any of the following apply: (1) Failed or incomplete courses. Passing grades which do not permit enrollment in a required follow on course may still represent a deficiency for failure to maintain satis factory progress, see 1.d above; (2) Failure to maintain good academic standing with the academic i nstitution; (3) Failure to meet standards identified under paragraph 1 above; (4) Term credit less than 12 credits (excluding Naval Science credits) without PNS approval for midshipmen or less than term credit equal to full time student for ME CEPs and STA -21 OCs; (5) Calculus or physics requirement not met as scheduled with out a time -of-completion waiver; or (6) For a repeat failure of a program required calculus or physics course the PNS must place the student on LOA . 3-19 Conduct and Aptitude Standards of Midshipman Performance 1. Conduct Standards . Students are expected to conduct themselves per the standards of socially acceptable behavior and display military officer bearing and demeanor at all times . Inappropriate standards of conduct are categorized as major and minor offenses. a. Major offenses . Major offenses are those offenses which violate the NROTC Honor Code or involved moral turpitude, a serious breach of discipline, disregard or contempt f or authority , or actions NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-32 which bring discredit upon the Naval S ervice . Major offenses include but are not limited to the following: (1) Falsehoods of any nature, including fraud, cheating, plagiarism , and intentional failure of any NROTC standard ; (2) Theft; (3) Moral turpitude abuse; (8) Destroying or defacing property; (9) Aggravated or repeated unauthorized absence; (10) Sexual harassment/assault; (11) Pattern o f conduct unbecoming an officer (conviction not required) ; and (12) Repeated infractions of minor offenses. b. Minor offenses . Minor offenses are offenses of a less serious nature that involve comparatively minor infractions of instructions, orders, or regulations, such as poor grooming standards , poor personal appearance, and repeated tardiness or unauthorized absence regarding prescri bed Naval Science classes or activities. 2. Aptitude Standards . Aptitude is the perceived ability of a student to succeed in commissioned service. The delineation between satisfactory and substandard aptitude is a responsibility of the PNS. The PNS shall determine aptitude performance based on personal observation, counseling records, and discussions with unit personnel. The PNS shall document this performance on the midshipman's fitness reports (Section 6-5) and in OPMIS. a. An aptitude deficiency exists when any of the following apply: commission of a major or minor offense (as described above), failure to meet physical readiness requirements (as described below), poor display of leadership, unwillingness to schedule required academic courses, dropping courses without prior approval of the PNS, o r poor personal conduct , such as irresponsibility in contracting debt. b. While term aptitude marks shall reflect all aptitude deficiencies, students who commit a major offense should be considered for a disciplinary disenrollment rather than an aptitude disenrollment (see Chapter 6). c. Students who receive a term aptitude grade of 2.5 or below shall receive, at a minimum, an \"Aptitude Warning\" letter from the PNS (See section 6-7 ). The PNS may also choose to place the student on probation. Marginal performers who are retained in the NROTC Program are to be regularly NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-33 supervised and counseled by the responsible class advisor and the PNS. If improvement to full acceptability is no t noted, the PNS will consider disenrollment. 3-20 Physical Readiness Standards All students must strive for their highest levels of excellence in physical fitness and swimming skills. The amount of personal effort and improvement shall be used to determ ine aptitude for the service. The standards regarding physical fitness and body composition are addressed in applicable Navy and Marine Corps directives OPNA VINST 6110.1 (series ) or MCO 6100.13A . Physical Fitness Standards a. Navy Option midshipmen and STA -21 OCs must obtain a PFA score of \"Good Low\" (utilizing 20 - 24 year age group for midshipmen and appropriate age group for STA -21 OCs) as outlined in OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) in all areas . A swim may be substituted fo r a run only in special cases; i f a run is not completed during the first c lass year, approval is required from NSTC N93. b. Marine Option midshipmen must obtain a PFT score of 200 for their current age group for scholarship activation. 3/C and 2/C Marine Option midshipmen must obtain a 235 for their current age group as outlined in MCO 6100.13A . Although not required, it is recommended that Marine Option students maintain a PFT score of 265 or higher to successfu lly complete the 6 -week OCS course . The CFT minimum score is 235. Note: Approximately 10% of Marine Option scholarships are 3 -year scholarships awarded to high school graduates with college credits. For these midshipmen , the 200 PFT apples to their first year. c. All students must meet the applicable standard above during their First Class year in order to commission . d. All students are expected to improve their level of physical readiness achievement as they progress through the program . The effort and initiative shown in this regard is a direct measure of aptitude for service as a commissioned officer . If the member is not within standards, the PNS must have a medical evaluation conducted prior to assigning the student to remedial FEP. 2. Body Composition Standards . NROTC students whose height/weight and/or body fat percentage exceed established standards below shall participate in FEP physical conditioning and are to obtain professional dietary assistance . If out of standards, midshipmen, STA -21 OCs, and MECEPs shall not be commissioned. a. Navy midshipmen are not allowed to have body fat percentages in excess of 23% for males and 34% for females . Neither PNS nor NSTC N9 may waive. b. MCO 6110.3 (series ) gives the body fat percentag e limits for Marine Option midshipmen and MECEPs . PNS or NSTC N9 shall not waive. 3. Swimming Standards a. Midshipmen shall qualify as Swimmer 3rd Class (MILPERSMAN 1414.010 ), by the end of the first year in the program . NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-34 b. Units shall verify that STA -21 OCs and MECEP Marine s have met service swim qu alifications. c. Due to the number of career paths that require Swimmer 2nd Class, a ll students shall test for Swimmer 2nd Class. Those qualifying as Swimmer 2nd class are exempt from further swim testing. Students failing to qualif y Swimmer 2nd class shall re test annually. 4. Physical Fitness Deficiencies (see Appendix B ). A physical fitness deficiency , which is also an aptitude deficiency, exists when any of the following apply: a. Failure to meet the physical fitness or body composition standards giv en above during an official PFA; (1) For s eniors , the PNS shall place the student on LOA and shall not commission the student prior to them subsequently meeting the above physical fitness and body composition standards. (2) For all other students who fail to meet the above standards , the PNS shall take administrative and/or remediation actions as appropriate for the sev erity and number of failures . Appendix B provides guidance. (3) Units shall submit a disenrollment package and recommendation for students failing to meet the above standards twice in a three year period. Note that the above standards are higher than the general Navy standards. Any CO recommendation for retention in a disenrollment package submitted under this paragraph must provide justification for an excepti on to this disenrollment policy; and b. Failure to me et the swimming standards above. (1) Midshipmen who cannot meet swimming standards within the first year of the program must seek remedial swim instruction . NOTE: Swim Test Administrator is not a swim instructor qualification. (2) In preparation for The B asic School (TBS), MECEPs and Marine Option midshipmen should be allowed ample opportunity to master swim requirements ; (3) College Program midshipmen shall not be admitted to advanced standing unless these standards are met ; and (4) Students unable to meet swim standards are subject to a PRB convened by the NROTC unit. 3-21 Midshipmen Military Organization General . This section provides general guidance in structuring the military organization of NROTC midshipmen . The actual military organization of the students of any particular NROTC unit shall conform to unit requirements and abide by host institution policies, as long as they are not inconsistent with NROTC goals . Organization . Approximately 200 midshipmen will form one battalion and three companies that will be organized, in general, as follows: a. Each co mpany containing three platoons; b. Each platoon containing three or four squads; NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-35 c. Each s quad containing 6 -10 midshipmen; d. NROTC student officers shall be as follows : (1) Battalion Staff (a) Commander: Midshipman Commander (b) XO: Midshipman Lieutenant (c) Operations Officer: Ensign (g) Chief Petty Officer: Midshipman Chief Petty Officer ; (2) Color Guard (a) National Color Bearer: Midshipman Chief Petty Officer (b) Battalion Color Bearer: Midshipman Chief Petty Officer (c) Color Escort: Midshipman Petty Officer First Class (d) Color Escort: Midshipman Petty Officer First Class ; (3) Drum and Bugle Corps or Band (a) Commander: Midshipman Lieutenant Junior Grade (b) XO: Midshipman Ensign (c) Chief Petty Officer: (d) Mustering Petty Officer: Midshipman Mustering Petty Officer ; (4) Company Staff (three companies) (a) Commander: Midshipman Lieutenant (b) XO: Midshipman Lieutenant Junior Grade (c) Chief Petty Officer: Midshipman Chief Petty Officer ; and (5) Platoon Organization (a) Commander: Midshipman Ensign NSTC M Midshipman Mustering Petty Officer (c) Midshipman Petty Officer First Class (d) Squad Leaders: Midshipman Petty Officer First Class ; The PNS is authorized to deviate from this structure in cases where such action is appropriate, normally for reasons of unit size . Where this is done, the basic intent of establishing a military structure and promoting midshipmen professional growth shall be observed . Whenever possible, the PNS shall use the battalion organizational concep t. At some institutions where ROTC units of the Army or Air Force are established, the PNS may consider it advantageous to have the NROTC Battalion Comm ander appointed to the rank of M idshipman Captain, with other ranks adjusted accor dingly to achieve comparability. The number of battalion, company , and platoon staff officer s shown above shall not be increased . Instead, collateral duties shall be assigned to provide fo r other areas of responsibility. Units having drill teams may integrate students into regular ba ttalion companies or constitute drill companies as distinct entities within the overall battalion structure . At no time shall NROTC unit drill teams use fixed bayonets, either i n practice or during exhibition. The intent of the battalion organization is to promote the military development of NROTC students . Each student must be assigned to a position of responsibility prior to commissioning in order to develop leadership skills . Units shall make assignments to students as early as possible and not rese rve assignments for seniors . Special attention shall be given to those students whose development indicates a need for both guidance and the opportunity for experience. The battalion shall seek academic excellence . The battalion shall exercise consider able responsibility in organizing and conducting tutoring, remedial instruction, and other forms of academic assistance . The battalion academic officer shall coordinate these programs. Although the military organization outlined makes provision for a dr um and bugle corps or band, the Navy will not provide or fund such items as musical instruments, music, and musical supplies for such activities. NROTC u nit staff shall constantly monitor safety procedures when allowing midshipmen to supervise other midsh ipmen . All functions and operations must incorporate ORM . NROTC unit staff shall implement a formal ORM study with recurring events of even moderate risk where midshipmen leadership is relied heavily upon . Under no circumstances shall midshipmen be the sole supervision of unit functions with elevated risk . 3-22 New Student Orientation Programs New Student Orientation (NSO) . Orientation programs for new midshipmen were traditionally conducted at NROTC units. Typically, these programs ranged from two to sev en days in duration and were used to orient incoming students to the NROTC Program. With the advent of New Student Indoctrination (NSI), NSO is no longer funded. While units are not required to execute an intensive, multi -day NSO, the PNS may still elect to conduct NSO as a means to level training for those that did not attend NSI. Alternatively, the PNS may conduct a one -to-two day administrative NSO to orient students NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-37 to the unit and complete administrative processes, including DD Form 4, urinalysis, a ny remaining medical items (See 3 -22.7.a.(2)), scholarship activation and unique university items (See 3 -22.2.g). 2. Objectives . When conducting an orientation program for new midshipmen, the following program objectiv es shall be considered for inclusion : a. Enrollment processing; b. Issuing uniforms and conducting basic instruction in Navy uniform regulations and grooming standards (not required for midshipmen that completed NSI ); c. Instruction in the basics of military customs, courtesies, traditions, and organization, including unit regulations and chain of command (not required for midshipmen that completed NSI ); d. Acquiring basic competency in military drill and ceremony (not required for midshipmen that completed NSI ); e. Physical fitness and swim testing to determine readiness to meet NROTC Program and Navy/Marine Corps requirements (successful completion of the PFA /PFT test at NSI meets this requirement. Note: There are separate lists for c ompletion of NSI and for the PFA/PFT at NSI) ; f. Instruction in the privileges and benefits of participation in the NROTC Program and individual responsibilities (not required for midshipmen that completed NSI ); g. Orientation in such other subject matter as desired by the unit and/or the university ( e.g., how to use the library, availability of tutoring services, u niversity rules and regulations); and h. The importance of team work and how the Naval Services function as a team (not required for midshipmen that completed NSI) . 3. Military Orientation Limitation s. If the PNS d irects a traditional NSO, active duty staff members must be present at all evolutions during orientation, to include movement between events . Orientation programs for new midshipmen are not the equivalent of boot camp . These programs shall not be a \"weeding out\" process, a hurdle, or an ordeal for newcomers to the program . Overzealous application of military training shall not be permitted during orientation . Hazing is never acceptable . The orientation staff shall demonstrate excellence through le adership and intr oduce new members of the Naval S ervice to a military environment . The four years which follow shall provide ample opportunity for identification of those who do not measure up to the standards of the Navy and Marine Corps. 4. Planning . If the PNS directs a traditional NSO, Orientation and Active Duty Staff members shall develop a detailed plan for the st udent orientation program us ing the objectives as a general framework . ORM shall be used to help identify and mitigate risks . Daily itine raries for midshipmen shall incorporate ample time for meals and rest, including an uninterrupted full night's sleep of at least eight hours . Planning for drill and physical readiness training shall reflect a graduated conditioning program of increasing d ifficulty . OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) and Chapter 3 of the Command Fitness Guide provide guidelines for war m-up and conditioning exercises . New Navy Option midshipmen shall demonstrate Good Low performance in the Navy PFA P rogram for the 20 -24 year old age group (i.e., the anticipated age upon graduation) in all categories . The Marine O ption standard is 200 on the PFT . This is the same standard found in Section 3-20, and if completed at NSI, this is sufficient for scholarship activation regarding the physical fitness requirement . Program plans shall clearl y define the duties, responsibilities, and scope of authority of all staff personnel and upper class students who shall supervise NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-38 and assist with the program . Training plans shall go beyond the preparation of a daily itinerary . NROTC staff shall prepare, review, and approve lesson plans for each lecture or evolution contemplated . The unit CO shall approve orientation programs, ensuring a risk assessment of each training evolution is conducted and procedures/safeguards are developed and implemented to eli minate or minimize the hazards involved . TTO procedures shall be incorporated into all curricula. 5. Execution . If the PNS directs a traditional NSO, staff supervision is the key to a successful orientation program . The CO shall be directly involved with the orientation program . Officers, other staff, and uppe r-class midshipmen who are selected for leadership positions must be fully cognizant of the purpose of the program, safety considerations, and the CO's directions regarding their responsibilities and authority . Fully qualified instructors shall conduct all evolutions . NROTC staff will select top performing upper -class midshipmen to assist officers or staff members in charge of events . Upper -class midshipmen shall not be placed in charge of any group of new students without frequent oversight by a staff officer . The PNS shall assign a staff officer as Duty Officer, on scene during each night of orientation, unless students are residing in university -operated residence halls . The new midshipmen will be allowed sufficient time for hygiene/showers and provided with as much privacy during this time as facilities permit . Hygiene/showering shall not be conducted as a military training evolution. 6. Orientation Program Responsibilitie s a. The NROTC Unit CO shall (if conducted ): (1) Review and a pprove, in consultation with the Training Safety Officer and with appropriate university authorities, all orientation program plans and curriculum; (2) Ensure that medical physical exams have been completed on all new midshipmen prior to participating in any strenuous training, to include physical fitness trainin g, and that risk screenings are completed in compliance with the Navy PFA and an Annual Certificate of Physical Co ndition, including completion of NSTC 1533/107 ; (3) Ensure that new students identified as possible risks are clear ed by medical authority before activating their scholarship , if applicable , and before participating in any demanding exercise or other elevated -risk training; (4) Ensure compliance with NSTC Hig h Risk Training Safety Pro gram, NSTCINST 1500.13 (series); (5) Ensure new students are provided training in the following areas : (a) Sexual Assault Prevention and Response ; (b) Fraternization ; (c) Hazing ; (d) Online / Social Media Conduct ; and (e) Trainer -Trainee Relations, DoDI 1304.33 , (requires completion of DD Form 2983 ); (6) Assign only instructors qualified to conduct scheduled training evolutions; NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 3-39 (7) Select only top performing upper -class midshipmen for orientation duty , and ensure they are fully cognizant of the goals of the program and scope of their authority; (8) Ensure maximum CO/XO on-scene oversight of orientation evolutions and progress; (9) Provide direction to orientation staff regarding safety, risk reduction, TTO procedures, and deviation from planned schedules or evolutions to reduc e risk (e.g., very hot/humid conditions) . Ensure Emergency Action Plans (EAP) are developed and briefed for reasonable contingencies that may occur during training evolutions with elevated risk ; (10) Ensure new students receive adequate fluids, food, and rest ; (11) Require a fire and evacuation drill from the quarters used by new students during the first day of training (not required if students are residing in a universit y-operated residence hall); and (12) Ensure availability of ambulance/medical facilities for phy sical readiness testing as required by OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) and MCO 6100.13A . b.

Safety . NROTC unit staff shall not schedule unnecessa rily hazardous activities . The required medical screening that precedes physical readiness testing and strenuous physical activity applies to orientation programs as well . ORM must be applied at all stages of planning to reduce risks . Strict adherence t o safety considerations during execution cannot be ove r-emphasiz ed during orientation programs. 8. Resources . New student orientation may be required by the PNS outside the regular academic year. NSTC N9 will not authorize augmentation of unit operating fu nds for new student orientation as New Student Indoctrination is designed to substitute as one program replacing many different ones across NROTC. New students participating in orientation programs shall not be charged any fees by the Navy nor be required to purchase any items in connection with the training.

(4) STA -21 and MECEP Officer Candidates enter similar service agreements prior to reporting to the unit per their respective programs . Units should verify that the student meets those agreements. d. Appointment refers to a student becoming a midshipman. (1) Midshipmen are appointed by executing the Acceptance and Oath of Office ( NSTC 1533/126 ) or the last item of the College Program Application (NSTC 1533/133). (2) STA -21 and MECEP Officer Candidates do not complete this step. 2. Timing . Except where a student repo rts late or is selected during the school year, the effective date of appointment into the NROTC Program is the date of the first day of orientation, the first day of classes at their respective academic institution , or the date authorized by N9 and meeting all requirements . The student's Date of Initial Entry into Military Service (DIEMS) is the dat e the student signs the DD Form 4 and the service contract . 4-3 Enrollment Each candidate for enrollment in any NROTC Program must meet the following qualifications: a. Be a citizen of the United States and present official certified proof of citizenship, except as noted in Section 4-10; b.

There are no restrictions as to the marital status of a candidate . However, single parents who have custody of dependent children must present a Family Care Plan Arrangements Form NAVPERS 1740/7 to the unit that allows full attention to service responsibilities during initial training periods and subsequent duty assignments . Single parents must be advised that individuals accepted for Naval Service must maintain a high degree of commitment to professional responsibilities and exemptions from personnel policies or preferential treatment for duty assignments should not be expected. 3. NROTC applicants who have been nominated for an NROTC scholarship but choose to enroll in a service academy, state maritime academy, Army or Air Force ROTC Program, or any other officer -type training program, forfeit the NROTC scholarship . They may reapply the following year . College Program candidates who have previously enrolled in a service academy, a state maritime academy, an Army or Air Force ROTC Program, any service academy preparatory school, or any other officer -type training program, may not enroll in the NROTC College Program without written approv al from NSTC N9. The above individuals are not eligible for immediate scholarship benefi ts through programs such as the MSISR Program. The PNS may nominate for an NROTC 2- or 3-Year scholarship after all nomination requirements are met. A written request endorsed by the PNS with a Record of Disenrollment from O C-Type Training (DD Form 785) from the previous office r-training program is required . Applicants disenrolled fo r aptitude or disciplinary reasons, or \"not recommended for future officer programs\" from any service officer training program may not be accepted without prior authorization from NSTC N9. 4. Any person receiving compensation from the Veterans Administration (VA) for disability incurred in milita ry service of the United States or who has any claim pending under that administration on account of such disability is not eligible for enrollment or re -enrollment in NROTC . Veterans who have previously filed such c laims may become eligible for enrollment if: a. The VA has disallowed the clai m; or b. The veteran has withdrawn the claim under procedures set forth in current VA directives (withdrawal of any pending claim is voluntary ). 5. A former NROTC s cholarship or College Program student who desires re -enrollment as a College Program student must submit a written request to NSTC N93. Re-enrollment of students must be approved by NSTC N9. 4-4 Foreign Students Forei gn students are ineligible for scholarsh ip program s or Advanced Training Participation . Section 2103(b) of Title 10 authorizes persons from foreign countries to enroll in the NROTC Program under NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-6 criteria approved by the Secretary of State . For this instruction, \"persons from foreign countries\" means persons who are not citizens of the United States of America . Foreign persons are ineligible for: a. Advanced training under Section 2104 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code; and b. Scholarships under Section 2107 of Title 10, of the U.S . Code. College Program Basic Course Participation .

Persons who, although not yet eligible for naturalization, can produce written evidence that they have filed a Declaration of Intention (ICE Form N-300 or any successor form thereto) to become a citizen of the U.S . However, such persons must become natural ized U.S . citizens before they will be allowed to participate in Advanced Training, execute an enlistment contract, or receive any subsistence payments . Failure to obtain U.S . citizenship before the first day of Advanced Training requires the student to b e disen rolled from the College Program; b. Persons who are qualifying for commissions in the service of certain foreign government s; or c. Persons who are foreign Navy students . These students may participate in the NROTC basic course as spe cial Naval Science students through arrangement with the U.S . government and the foreign country's government . Except in special instances as determined by CNSTC, not more than five students from any one foreign country may be newly enrolled in any one NR OTC unit each year. Active recruitment of foreign persons to participate in NROTC should be avoided. 4-5 Welcome Aboard Letters The PNS/OIC shall send the student a Welcome Aboard Letter as soon as the unit becomes aware of the prospective student . In acco rdance with Section 3 -17.2.c.(2)(b) the letter shall include notification of Navy or Marine height/weight and physical fitness standards (i.e., Good Low for 20 -24 year olds or 200/235 PFT), along with information on the NRCFNG pre-entry physical conditioning program and the planned dates of the initial and official PFA/PFT /CFT . The letter shall also include the following forms (Items 3 through 5 are for review only and will be completed once the student arrives at the unit): Questionnaire for National Security Positions SF 86 and Fingerprint Card (SF 87); 2.

In doing so, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) will aff ect all payments through the Direct Deposit/ Electron ic Funds Transfer (EFT) Program; and 7. Self-addressed return envelope. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-7 4-6 Officer Program Management Information System (OPMIS) OPMIS supports the NROTC Program by providing a computer link between NSTC N9, each NROTC unit, DFAS, Navy Personnel Command (NPC), NRC, and DoDMERB . An OPMIS Student Record must be established by the unit for all Scholarship, Col lege Program, and OCs. 2. Due to the relationship between OPMIS and the various other DoD systems that d erive information from it, it is imperative that every student file is complete and accurate . OPMIS must include student information, such as the type of NROTC program in which the student is enrolled, subsistence, grades, foreign language testing, swim, PFA/PFT/CFT , Leave of Absence (LOA ), probation, estimated commissioning dates, and security clearance. 3. OPMIS is also used to activate scholarships and ot her program benefits . All students who report to the unit shall be \"reported -in\" via OPMIS , but benefits will not be activated until the student is found to be fully qualified and has executed all applicable agreements. 4. The NROTC unit shall ensure that on 1 October each year , all records for new reports are verified up to date in OPMIS and that \"Student Reported\" procedures have been followed . Any student who has not reported, except those students with an approved deferment or LOA , will be coded as \"declined\" in OPMIS by this date. 5. Units shall maintain accurate and up -to-date OPMIS records an d student files for all required students throughout the student's participation in the NROTC Program. 6. For further information regarding OPMIS at the unit level, consult the OPMIS NROTC Training Manual available from NETPDC. 4-7 Navy College Management Information System (NCMIS) NCMIS supports the NROTC Program by providing a computer link to facilitate administration of STA -21 OCs . The information that may be stored in NCMIS includes personal data, university class schedules, and funding available to each student . At the NROTC unit level, NCMIS is used to forecast funding requirements and manage each ST A-21 OC's available funding. 2. The PNS shall assign an NROT C/university staff member to be responsible for maintaining personal information and syllabus data in NCMIS . The staff member must be provided with Privacy Act training before undertaking these duties . The staff member shall produce a STA -21 Tuition Auth orization Form indicating the fees directly charged by the university each semester the ST A-21 OC is enrolled . Once the form is signed by both the OC and the staff member, the OC must take the form to the b ursar's office and request that the academic inst itution invoice the Government . Copies of the STA -21 Tuition Authorization Forms and all reimbursable expenses shall be maintained in the Student File. 4-8 Reporting Incoming Students NROTC Scholarship Midshipmen . The NROTC unit is informed of all incoming Four -Year National Scholarship students via an OPMIS GF20R61 Report or Placement Table . The unit will enter students listed on the GF20R61 report as \"accepted\" into OPMIS upon verification of their acceptance by the educational institution into a major i n the appropriate tier . Prior to enrollment in OPMIS, the NROTC unit must ensure the appropriate physical qualification code is reflected in OPMIS . If the student is not NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-8 physically qualified, the unit shall not activate the scholarship or allow the stude nt to sign any documents (See Chapter 9 for more guidance) . Although the student may attend class, the scholarship and stipend must not be activated by the unit, and the student shall be advised that any costs incurred are at the student's risk and ultimately may not be paid by NROTC . Once the student is found physically qualified (PQ), the documents will be dated on or after the day the stu dent is found PQ or waiverable . Do not back -date documents . The tuition is retroactive to the beginning of the term (semester/quarter), but subsistence starts the day the PNS and individual sign the DD Form 4 and NSTC Form 1533/135 . The NROTC scholarshi p agreement and enlistment document can only be executed on or after the actual date the student is found physically qualified or waived . If NSTC N9 concludes that the delay in determining the student's physical qualification is no fault of the student's , retroactive payment of tuition, fees and books is authorized . However, s ubsistence cannot be back -dated because it falls under Military Personnel, Nav y (MPN) funds, and the student is not officially on the Navy roster until they sign the Enlistment/Reenl istment Document Armed Forces of the United States DD Form 4/1 . NSTC N93 shall address retroactive payment requests. 2. NROTC College Program Midshipmen . Those interested in becoming College Program Basic students must complete an NROTC College Program Application, NSTC 1533/133 . 3. STA -21 OCs . The NROTC unit is informed of all incoming STA -21 OCs via an O PMIS GF20R61 Report or an Official Mail M essage published by N92. PERS 4010 cannot issue orders to STA -21 selectees until they have been accepted into a college or university and have undergone medical screening and rec eived favorable results . STA -21(N) OCs shall attend the earliest possible NSI class. 4. STA -21 Nuclear Option OCs a. Upon completion of the STA -21 selection process, NSTC N91 will forward the list of nuclear option selectees and alternates, with their top three school choices, to the appropriate NROTC units . The PNS shall provide information to the nuclear option selectees on housing, tuition, enrollment procedures, and other useful relocation information . The unit Nuclear Power Officer (NPO) may be neede d to assist in expediting the admissions process for these students. b. The NPO shall verify that each OC has six years of obliga ted service as of the date report ed to the NROTC unit. 5. MECEP and Meritorious Commissioning Program Reserve (MCP -R) OCs . The NROTC unit is informed MECEP/MCP OCs by MCRC (ON/E) . All MECEP and MCP OCs ' student data must be entered in OPMIS when they join the unit. 6. SSM . Departments of Naval Science at the USMMA and state maritime academies are informed of incoming students through the respective academic institution's registrar's office . Those interested in participating in the SSMP complete an SSMP application . Processing of midshipman applications must be completed at USMMA within the first month of the student's arrival at the academy . The p rocessing of midshipman applicants at the state academies shall be completed once the student indicates a desire to enter the program. 4-9 Student File The unit , with the exception of Senior Military Colleges (SMCs), will maintain a Student File for each student . SMCs are not required to maintain student files on students who have not expressed interest in commissioning through the NROTC program. The Student File must be reviewed annually by a reviewing authority other than the unit staff member charged with maintaining the file . The review shall NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-9 be annotated on the Student File Index NSTC 1533/128 . Electronically generated documents are allowed but their use does not eliminate the requirement for original signatures .

At institutions operating an accelerated program or cooperative study programs, students who register and participate in NROTC unit training during summer terms may be paid subsistence allowanc e during such period subject to the limitations for the basic and advanced courses. No Authorization . Summer school tuition is not authorized for midshipman who need to make up credits to gradua te on schedule because they dropped or failed courses, lost credit due to change of major, did not carry a large enough class load, or ha ve a substandard GPA. Payment of summer school tuition does not extend a midshipman 's obligation to the government. Universities with semester or quarter hour schedules equaling less than 10 months of total benefits per academic year may authorize summer term attendance provided it meets the following criteria: a. Student's attendance of summer school does not conflict with mandato ry summer training requirements; b. Total benefits for tuition and stipend do not exceed 10 months of total benefits in any given acade mic year and 40 months total; c. Courses must be recommended by the student's academic advisor and approved by the PNS or designated represe ntative prior to the start of the term . Courses being repeated due to prior failure or withdrawal which h as previously been paid for are not covered and are th e responsibility of the student; and d. It is the responsibility of the individual unit t o ensure the 10 -month maximum is strictly adhered to, taking into account start and stop times for stipend benefits related to orientation and other obligations which may exceed normal academic start and stop dates. 4-26 STA -21 Tuition Authorization and Reimbu rsable Expenses STA -21 OCs are authorized to receive up to $10,000 each calendar year in advanced educational assistance . All tuition authorized must be recorded by the unit Supply technician on a STA -21 Tuition Authorization Form . STA -21 OCs are also e ligible to claim reimbursement for books and consumable supplies necessary for their education by completing a Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business ( OF 1164 ). When claiming books and miscellaneous expenses, the OC must provide receipts indicating the costs incurred to the designated NROTC/university staff member . The staf f member will then prepare the O F 1164 via Invoicing, Receipt, Acceptance, and Property Transfer (iRAPT) , which requires the OC's signature and an authorizing official's signature . Once the O F 1164 is processed by NETPDC N811, DFAS will make an EFT payment directly to the OC . Specific requirements and allow ances for reimbursement are listed in OPNAVINST 1420.1 (series ). STA -21 tuition, books, and fee payment questions may be directed to NSTC N8 . NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-22 4-27 Foreign Language Testing and Registry NROTC units are required to screen all students for language skills . Those students who self -identify skills in a language listed on the Navy Strategic Language list (see NSTCINST 1550.1 (series) ) and for which a test exists must be test ed prior to commissioning. Screening and testing for midshipmen shall take place at the beginning of the senior year, to include STA-21 and MECEPs who have not already been tested . This timeline ensures that the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) s cores (whi ch are valid for one year) remain valid through the commissioning date. All screening and testing shall be conducted by the unit Test Control Officer (TCO) . Once the screening and testing has been completed, the results shall be entered in OPMI S. Maritime academies may submit SSMP foreign language screening and test results using a spreadsheet . This report shall be maintained as current as possible. Students may be eligible for Foreign Language Proficiency Bonus , provided they meet the requirements of the Foreign Language Proficiency Bonus Program (OPNAVINST 7220.7H ). 4-28 Leave of Absence (LOA) An LOA is, in effect, a suspension of NROTC benefits . Placing a student on LOA, other than by the student's requests, must follow due process covered in Section 6-7. While it may be requested in some situations, it may be required in others. Typically, LOAs do not apply to MECEP and STA -21 OCs because of their active duty status . However, they may make requests for overseas study, internships, personal hardship, or medical reasons . Requests shall be by standard n aval letter from the OC to CNSTC via the PNS and NSTC N93. For STA - 21(N) OCs, requests shall be approved by OPNAV N133 via NSTC N91 prior to forwarding documentation to NSTC N93. MECEPs forward their request to MCRC via the Senior Marine, NETC . In the event a MECEP requires longer than four years to complete their degree, an extension will be requested by standard n aval letter, wit h justification, from the MECEP to MCRC via the Senior Marine, NETC . See Appendix Q for more details. OCs may only pursue an internship if it is a degree requirement and does not delay commissioning . All internships for STA -21 OCs shall be conducted nea r the host institution . MECEP Marine s approved for overseas study will be considered to be on unofficial travel status. Types of LOA . There are several types of LOA . Each type may require additional consideration, supporting documentation or endorsemen ts. a. Performance Related LOAs . Performance related LOAs will result in forfeiture of benefits for the term of the LOA and are not eligible to be paid retroactively . These types of LOA are assigned based upon failure to meet standards given in Chapter 3. Further discussion is provided in Chapter 6 and Appendix B : (1) Academic; (2) Aptitude ; NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-23 (3) Disciplinary ; and (4) Physical Readiness . b. Special : (1) Overseas Study and Internships . Students may request LOA to participate in professional programs overseas . LOA for overseas study is discussed in Section 4-42; (2) Personal . Upon the student's request, the PNS has the authority to assign an LOA for personal hardship or other reas ons found compelling by the PNS; (3) Graduate Study . Navy Option m idshipmen may request LOA from NSTC N93 to participate in professional programs that lead to a graduate degree . LOA for the purpose of graduate study is addressed in Section 4-40; and (4) Religious Mission . Used for a midshipman who is partaking in a religi ous mission, charity , or humanitarian work and will be away from the unit for an extended period not to exceed 24 months. This does not relieve the midshipman of obligation in accordance with their service contract , e.g., a student who remains in the NROT C Program but who takes an LOA during the sophomore year becomes obligated. c. Expiration of Benefits . A student's benefits may expire prior to the completion of all NROTC Program requirements, including degree completion . The PNS may grant LOA to allow completion of these requirements no later than 12 months . If the LOA extends the graduation date or the commissioning date, the PNS shall notify NSTC N9 by mail or email as the need is known and update the OPMIS graduation date. d. Dropped from USMC OCS . In the instance of a Marine Option m idshipman being dropped from OCS, the student will be immediately placed on interim LOA until a PRB can be convened. If a Marine Option midshipman is invited back to OCS and completi on is pending medical clearance, actions in the next paragraph are more appropriate than a PRB. e. Medical . Students who are unable to meet program requirements due to medical conditions may be granted a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA). MLOAs are discussed in section Error! Reference s ource not found. Duration of LOA; Authority to Grant LO A. The PNS is authorized to grant an LOA (non -medical) of up to one full academic term . A full academic term of LOA is defined as beginning prior to o r on the 45th day of the semester/quarter and not being removed from LOA until after the 45th day of the semester/quarter. LOA requests for consecutive, full -term LOAs (non -medical) of any type, or a second, full-term, non -consecutive LOA of the same type (non-medical) during a midshipman's tenure may only be approved by the Deputy Commander for NROTC Operations, N04, via NSTC N93. N04 may also approve a third quarter of LOA (non -medical) to allow consistency between semester and quarter systems. A third semester, fourth quarter or more of LOA, regardless of the length of the term of LOA, during a midshipm an's tenure may only be granted by CNSTC after endorsement by N04. No LOA may be extended by more than two years . An already authorized LOA may be extended in writing by NSTC N9 to permit the student to engage in charitable and humanitarian work up to two consecutive, full -terms (or three quarters for quarter schools) . NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December a. LOA Request . LOA requests and requests for extension of an LOA shall be made using standard naval letter format . If made by the student, the LOA request shall be processed via the PNS . The PNS shall include a statement of facts, a justification for why the LOA is req uested , and a current transcript and updated DCP which accounts for the requested LOA . b. Time for Decision . The PNS shall process all LOA requests as soon as possible and make a determination on each request no later than when the next tuition payment is due. c. Notice to Student . The PNS shall notify the student of the terms and conditions of the LOA in a written notice that states the duration and requirements of the LOA and actions, including disenrollment that may be taken if the midshipman fails to comply with the LOA's provisions . The notice shall state that the midshipman will be personally responsible for payment of any tuition, fees, and other educational expenses incurred during any academic term on which the student is on LOA and that, except as noted in Chapter 7, such expenses are not payable by NROTC. The notification of LOA shall be acknowledged by the student with d ate and signature. d. LOA Terms and Conditions . The LOA may require the midshipman to attend Naval Science classes and participate in unit activities at their own expense while on LOA, if the PNS so directs . Continued participation in the NROTC program is mandatory for s tudents placed on a performance - related LOA so th e PNS can continue to observe the midshipman 's performance. For LOAs assigned for reasons not related to performance, the required participation is at the discretion of the PNS. e. End of LOA . The PNS will notify the midshipman by letter when they are removed from LOA status and shall be acknowledged by the student with date and signature . f. OPMIS Entries . If the LOA is approved, the PNS shall ensure that following actions are taken as soon as possible: (1) The unit enters the LOA code and start date in the OPMIS Miscellaneous Form, which will also change the Subsistence Form; and (2) DFAS is notified of the student's LOA status . Similarly, the PNS shall ensure that the u nit timely enters the LOA end date in the OPMIS Miscellaneous form and timely notifies DFAS of the return of the student from LOA. Effect of LOA on NROTC Program Benefits a. NROTC shall not pay or be obligated to pay any financial benefits, including tuition, fees, stipend or subsistence payments for any midshipme n during the time they are on LOA . Payments for such benefits shall be suspended as of the effective date of the L OA. b. Midshipmen on LOA status are responsible for all tuition and fees and will not receive subsistence payment. c. NSTC N9 in their reasonable discretion may authorize retroactive payments of tuition benefits for students plac ed on LOA bec ause: (1) Transitory physical conditions render them temporarily physically disqualified (M LOA); or NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-25 (2) Extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control, as reasonably determined . A condition of making such payments shall be that the midshipman attends class and meets all other program requirements. d. Midshipmen on LOA do not incur any additional military service obligation. e. Midshipmen on LOA as they enter their sophomore year, despi te not receiving benefits, become obligated and are subject to recoupment or AES if they are later disenrolled from the program . f. The PNS shall ensure that midshipmen on LOA are notified of any recommendation for commissioning and all other administrative actions at the same time and in the same ma nner as for all other NROTC students. 4-29 Student Awards The PNS shall recognize outstanding performance . Awards and formal recognition to NROTC students shall be initiated by u nit awards boards or similar staff bodies and given for ex cellence of performan ce in the categories of academic excellence and performance of duty/military aptitude. The PNS shall present the majority of NROTC awards at an annual formal ceremony to which parents and relatives of midshipmen and OCs, distinguished members of the local university, civilian, and military communities, and representatives of presenting organizations are invited to attend . Representatives of presenting organizations shall be invited to attend and participate in the ceremonies. A list of awards for which students may be nominated is contained in Appendix E of this manual. 4-30 Midshipman Official Name Change MIDN may submit a name change request to their NROTC Unit. The request shall be accompanied by at least one of the documents listed below as documentary evidence verifying the change in name: a. Marriage Certificate; b. Final divorce decree containing provision for restoration of maiden name; c. Court order authorizing name change; d. Birth Certificate - may be used only upon initial accession; e. Naturalization Certificate; or f. Social Security Card. The NROTC unit shall maintain the name change request along with a copy of the supplied supporting documents in the MIDN's student file. The NROTC unit shall update the MIDN's name in the student record in OPMIS. The NROTC Unit shall update the MIDN's NAVPERS 1070/602, SGLI form and direct the MIDN to receive a new CAC Card. In order to ensure commissioning documents as well as future orders are issued in the correct name, a copy of the legal documentation authorizin g the name c hange must be forwarded to N93 for any MIDN who legally changes their name after entering the Service Assignment cycle. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-26 4-31 Transfers between NROTC Colleges/Universities Midshipmen may request transfer to other NROTC academic institutions under c ertain conditions . Due to PCS costs and other factors, OCs may not transfer to other institutions unless applying to a cros s- town school within the NROTC unit's consortium . Requests are sent to NSTC N93. A midshipman requesting a transfer to any other NROTC institution must: a. Be in good standing (e.g., cannot be on academic/ aptitude probation or LOA); b. Be accepted by the academic institution to which they are requesting transfer . A copy of an acceptance letter must be included in the transfer request; c. Provide a written statement of the reason they are requesting a transfer and whether it concerns a proposed course of study (e.g., difficulty of obtaini ng courses required for degree); d. Have a tuition cost at the next institution not significantly high er than the current institution; e. N ot result in a significant loss of credit or delay graduation or commissioning, as evidenced by a DCP from the gaining unit . The student must be briefed tha t requests for extend ed entitlements resulting from the approval of a transfer will not be approved; f. Secure a favorable endorsement by the PNSs at both NROTC units . Endorsements should address the above requirements; and g. Normally have one full academic year of observation. If NSTC N9 approves the request, the transferring NROTC unit shall: a. Forward the complete NROTC Student File, Performance File, Medical/Dental Record, and an official t ranscript to the receiving unit; b. Ensure that al l data in OPMIS is current and th at all grades have been entered; and c. Ensure the student is released in DTS. The gaining unit shall: a. Forward the request to NSTC N93 via the PNSs at both NROTC units; and b. Report to NSTC N93 when the student has reported and request the student be transferred in OPMIS. 4-32 Extended Entitlements (EE) 1. Academic programs requiring more than four academic years for completion of baccalaureate degree requirements (including elective requirements of the Senior ROTC course) are eligible for EE. EE may provide financial assistance under this section during a fifth academic year for qualified majors. This assistance may include regular semesters/quarters or summer sessions beyond Naval Science year four. EE may be applied only after the student has used all normal entitlements. Students may not be required to enroll in Naval Science courses but shall participate in all other unit activities while receiving EE. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-27 a. EE is not mandatory for qualified majors. Units shall apply all transferable college credits when validating a student's Degree Completion Plan (DCP) to see if the student can graduate without the use of EE. b. Units shall encourage the use of summer school in lieu of EE terms when practical. c. All \"PNS -not recommended\" EE requests shall be forwarded to the annual EE Panel to af ford the student a second look at the request. d. Utilization of EE creates an additional service obligation as follows: (1) Per Semester: 6 -month obligation (2) Per Quarter: 4 -month obligation (3) Per Summer Session (after 4th academic year in NROTC) : 3-month obligation e. EE approval is only valid for a specific major and university. Therefore, a change in majors or universities will invalidate any existing EE approvals. However, a student may re -apply for EE as necessary. 2. The PNS has the authority to approve student EE requests for majors on the CNSTC List of Approved Degrees for EE. In the event a specific degree should be removed from or added to the CNSTC List of Approved Degrees for EE, it is the responsibility of the unit to contact N93 and submit a formal request to CNSTC (template available). The request shall include the following for each major: a. Option EE requesting approval for (USN/USMC or both) b. How many extra terms request ed for specific option c. Justification for EE (calculations for course load, or list of classes for sequencing) The PNS request to get a degree approved for EE by CNSTC shall be based on the following: a. If the major (combined with mandatory NROTC courses) requires more than four years due to excessive course load (over 18 credits per term [or quarter system equivalent]): The number of extra terms will be the minimum required to reduce the course load to no more than 18 credits per term. Example: Credits required for major + Credits required for NROTC program - Overlapping credits (e.g., math, physics) = Total credits required \u00f7 8 semesters (or equivalent quarters) = Total credits required per term b. If the major (combined with mandatory NROTC courses) requires more than four years due to sequencing: The number of extra terms will be the minimum to complete the required sequence. 4. Student EE requ ests shall be submitted after the completion of the student's sophomore year, but no later than 15 October of the Fall semester of their junior year. This timeframe is to minimize paperwork in the event the student changes majors (submitting too early), a nd to ensure this does not affect Service Selection (submitting too late). Student EE requests will be processed in one of two ways: NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-28 a. Student EE requests that qualify IAW CNSTC List of Approved Degrees for EE: (1) Student will request EE from the PNS. (2) PNS can approve or not recommend based on factors such as student performance, application of prior college credits, summer school as an alternative, etc. If EE is approved by the PNS: (a) Unit shall submit PNS endorsed approval letter to N93 (template available) with the following information: 1. Student Name 2. Class 3. Option 4. Program Code 5. Major 6. GPA 7. Justification for EE (Course Load or Sequencing) 8. How many extra terms approved 9. Term type (Quarter or Semester) (b) Upon validation, N93 will notify unit to: 1. Initiat e and send to N93 an electronic copy of signed form NAVPERS 1070 -613 (Page 13, template available), which includes a Statement of Understanding (SOU) of the required extension and for continued participation in unit activities while on EE. The original Pa ge 13 shall be added to the student's commissioning documents that are sent to PERS. 2. Update Student's Estimated Date of Commission and Date of Graduation in OPMIS to reflect the approved term(s). (c) Upon receipt of the e lectronic copy of the signed Page 13, N93 will change student's status to receive EE in OPMIS, and notify unit once complete. (d) N9 shall provide CNSTC an update on all PNS approved EE requests. If EE is not recommended by th e PNS , the unit shall submit a full EE package to the annual EE Panel with a negative PNS endorsement. b. EE requests that do not qualify IAW CNSTC List of Approved Degrees for EE shall be submitted as a full EE package to N93 for the annual EE Pa nel. EE packages shall include: (1) EE Request Cover Sheet (contact N93 for template) which includes questionnaire and checklist (2) Student request to NSTC containing an SOU of the required extension and for continued participation i n unit activities while on EE. (3) PNS endorsement (positive or negative) with recommended extra terms (4) Most recent transcripts (will accept unofficial) NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-29 (5) DCP without EE (showing excessive course load and/or sequencing) (6) DCP with EE (showing adjusted course load and/or sequencing) 5. EE Panel - N93 shall hold a panel annually in November (and additional supplemental panels as required) to process EE requests that either are not recommended by the PNS, or that do not qualify IAW CNSTC List of Approved Degrees. The EE Panel will consist of 3 members of NSTC who will each make a case -by-case recommendation for each EE request. a. Factors for consideration (not all inclusive): (1) PNS's endorsement, noting specifics about the student's request (2) GPA (3) Previous course load NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-30 (4) Justification / extenuating circumstances b. Common factors for disapproval: (1) Academic deficiency (2) Failure to complete an academic requirement (3) Scheduling conflict created by an avoidable student action (4) Major change that creates a need for additional term(s) (5) Lost credits due to university transfer 6. Recommendations from the EE Panel shall be forwarded to N9. N9 shall then make a recommendation, and then forward to CNSTC for final decision. 7. CNSTC final decision is normally promulgated via Official Mail Message or a direct response to units via N93. a. If approved for EE, unit shall: (1) Initiate and send to N93 an electronic copy of signed form NAVPERS 1070 -613 (Pag e 13, template available), which includes a Statement of Understanding (SOU) of the required extension and for continued participation in unit activities while on EE. The original Page 13 shall be added to the student's commissioning documents that are se nt to PERS. (2) Update Student's Estimated Date of Commission and Date of Graduation in OPMIS to reflect the approved term(s). (3) Upon receipt of the electronic copy of the signed Page 13, N93 will change student's status to receive E E in OPMIS, and notify unit once complete. b. If denied for EE, MIDN shall be placed on Expiration of Benefits LOA (I -Code) as soon as practical upon expiration of scholarship funds. 4-33 Change of Option, Marine to Navy Midshipman Midshipmen can request a change of option from Marine to Navy in writing to the PNS .

The unit shall ensure the midshipman signs and acknowledges the following Page 13 entry: \"Scholarship students approved for transfer to the College Program who have received more than one year of subsidized education (two semesters/three quarters of tuition and ten months of subsistence), or accepted their scholarship at the beginning of the second or later year of Naval Science and receiving benefits, shall be required to repay the educational benefits they received while enrolled in the NROTC Program if they fail to comm ission unless otherwise waived.\" Upon receipt of the Appointment Termination, NSTC N93 will enter the appropriate OPMIS code to change the midshipman 's status from Scholarship student to College Program st udent. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-34 Prior to the start of the junior y ear, approved stu dents will be transitioned to College Program Basic. If not selected for A dvanced Standing, students will be disenrolled. If the student was obligated by their previous scholarship contract, a co mplete disenrollment package will be sen t to N93 for processing. 4-37 Change of Option, STA -21 STA -21 Target Option OCs are not normally allowed to change options unless found not physically qualified ( NPQ ) for their original designator . Changes that meet the needs of the Navy and do not delay commissioning may be considered by N04 assuming that the OC meets all requirements for the requested designator. STA -21 OCs who request a change of option or re -designation must submit their request s in writing to OPNAV N131 via NSTC N93. STA -21 Target Option OCs interested in the nuclear community shall request transfer to core or surface warfare option . This request shall be submitted to OPNAV N131 via NSTC N93. Applications for the nuclear comm unity are submitted to NSTC N91. STA -21 OCs will be interviewed by Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion before being accepted into the NNPP. 4-38 Transfers to Other Services' Programs for Midshipmen Inter -service transfers are not available for midshipmen . While midshipmen may seek appointments to any service academy or other ROTC programs, those desiring to transfer to other officer accession programs will be placed on LOA (pending disenrollment) and processed as a Drop on Request (DOR). If the midshipman 's disenrollment is subject to recoupment, the midshipman may submit a request to DFAS to have their recoupment order deferred . Upon commissioning and completion of two years of active duty, the former midshipman may request their entire obligation be term inated. 4-39 Inter -service Transfers for STA -21 and MECEP Students This section outlines responsibilities and procedures for allowing STA -21 and MECEP students to transfer to, and receive commissions in, the Marine Corps and Navy, respectively .

All overseas travel should be carefully evaluated prior to approval . Disregarding DoD travel clearance requirements may adversely affect the student's ability to obtain a nuclear designator and/or security clearance. 4-44 Service Assignment Survey The Servic e Assignment Survey is normally conducted during April of each year . It is used by NSTC, OPNAV N13, and NPC to anticipate Navy Option midshipman and ST A-21 OC graduation dates and determine designator production goals for service assignment . This survey is required for freshman, sophomore , and junior classes. When conducting the Service Assignment Survey, each NROTC unit is required to update or validate the \"Naval Science year\" and \"date of commission\" as listed in the OPMIS Student Data File . In addition, each unit must enter the \"first choice designator\" for each student in the Service Assignment Form . Although Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB) scores and other program requirements may not be completed yet, the unit shall not allow a studen t to choose a community for which they have already been disqualified. 4-45 Pre-Service Assignment/ Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) Assignment Requirements Student Naval Aviator (SNA) (1390) and Student Naval Flight Officers SNFO (1370) . The requirements for these designators are subject to change based on the most recent program authorization . Additional information for ASTB and pr e-commissioning physicals can be found at the Navy Medicine Operational Training Center (NMOTC) website. a. Age. Navy applicants must not have passed their 27th birthday when commissioned . SNA (1390) may be granted an age waiver up to their 29th birthday, and SNFO (1370) may be granted an age waiver up to their 31st birthday for active duty prior service . Marine Corps applicants must not have passed 27 1/2 at the time of commissioning . An age waiver may be granted up to their 29th birthday for all M arine Corps applicants inc luding prior service. b.

The ASTB exam can be retaken as long as the first retest occurs no sooner than the 31st day following the first administration and the second and final retest occurs no sooner than the 91st day following the second administration (test may only be taken 3 times) . The most recent score is used. Note: While Introductory Flight Screening (IFS ) is not a Pre -Service Assignment or MOS requirement, an IFS is required, post-commissioning, by both USN and USMC . The IFS is managed by Naval Aviation Schools Command (NASC) and conducted at Quantico, Annapolis, and Pensacola. Special Operations (SPECOPS) (1190) and Special Warfare (SPECWAR) SPECWAR (1180) . These requirements are subject to change based on the most recent program authorization . Applications for SPECOPS and SPECWAR are due to NSTC N93 in accordance with the annual Service Assignment OPMIS mess age. a. Physical Fitness . Applicants must pass a physical fitness test established by the SPECOPS/SPECWAR community and administered according to their policy. b. Pre-commissioning Physical . Applicants must be physically qualified by BUMED with no history of back or knee problems. c. Unofficial Transcript . Applicants must submit a current transcript with their application. d. Letters of Recommendations . Applicants should obtain letters of recommendation from current or former SPECOPS or SPECWAR officers to be included in the application. e.

Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) community manager shall only consider those students listing 1190 as their first choice and 1190 as their second choice only if 1180 was their first choice . A duplicate package is required for those students listing 1180 as the first choice and 1190 as the second choice, so one package may be forwarded to each community for consideration . NSTC N93 will forward applications to the appropriate community managers. Medical Officer (1970/5) and Dental Officer (1980/5 ). Thes e designators apply to officers attending medic al school on active or reserve duty . Officers designated as 1970 or 1980 will attend USUHS while on active duty . Officers designated as 1975 and 1985 will participate in the AFHPS Program as reserve NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-42 officers . During service assignment, midship men wanting to be considered for medical or dental officer must choose the respective designator as their RL choice . The NSTC Service Assignment Panel will consider the medical board recommendations when assigning desi gnators . Applicants not accepted for AFHPS or USUHS no later than 1 June of their senior year must accept an URL designator . Those selected for 1970 or 1980 are commissioned as regular officers . Those selected for 1975 or 1985 are commissioned as reserv e officers . Units must notify NSTC N93 immediately upon notification of acceptance to either USUHS or AFHPS or in the case of non -acceptance to either program. 4-46 Service Assignment Service Assignment is the process by which Navy Option midshipmen , STA -21 OCs, and SSM are assigned community designators . Marine Option midshipmen and MECEPs do not receive a military occupational specialty ( MOS ) until they complete The Basic School unless under the Marine Guaran teed Flight Option . Commissioning scrolls, as discussed in Section 4-51 are required before any regular or reserve officer is commissioned. Although final Service Assignment decisions are made during the last year of enrollment, information about the process takes place throughout the NROTC Program. a. During new student orientation or the initial enrollment period, PNSs are to communic ate to students they will be assigned where the Navy needs them most . The NROTC process is service assignment not service selection. b. Prior to the start of the sophomore year, the PNS will ensure that expectations regarding service assignment are reinforced to midshipmen before they become obligated . If students are not prepared to serve where the Navy needs them to serve, they should not continue in the program. c. Prior to the submission of student Service Assignment packages , the PNS is to communicate with seniors to ensure understanding and support of Navy needs and of service above self. Service Assignment is conducted by NSTC N9 based on Navy needs and input provided by the student and the unit . The information used to assign a desi gnator will come from the OPMIS Service Assignment Form and the Service Assignment Packages . NSTC N9 conducts a Service Assignment Panel that recommends designator assignment to CNSTC for approval. The OPMIS Service Assignment Form is the primary source of information for the actual assignment of designators for NROTC Navy Option midshipmen and STA -21 OCs and is derived directly from the student data file in OPMIS . Although some changes may be made at a later date, it is imperative that all student information such as Designator Choices, actual Date of Graduation/Commissioning, ASTB scores, and Physical Qualification Status be as accurate as possible prior to pulling the verification report . When re viewing and updating the student information contained in OPMIS, the following considerations apply: a. Units shall verify completion and accuracy of race, sex, ethnicity, dependents, marital status, home of record, require d university and Naval Science C ourses, Summer Training, degree major, cumulative GPA including Naval Science C ourses, aptitude scores, ASTB scores, security clearance status, status of pre-commissioning physical, commissioning date, and graduation date; b. Each student will be asked to list their top preferences for URL designators . Student must also indicate their preferred RL or Staff Corps (SC) designator should they be found NPQ for the URL at a NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-43 later date . Students shall not list designators for which they are not eligible (e.g ., 1390 without qualifying ASTB score, 1170 if they have been down -screened by NR) . The PNS must certify the applicant has not been physically disqualified for any designator they list ; c. In addition to the information given here, details on service assignment preference submission, service assignment packages, and t he deadline for final update of the OPMIS Service Assignment Form will be provided annually via Official Mail M essage ; and d. After the deadlines established by N STC N93 have passed, all service assignment data is transferred to the master Service Assignment File maintained by NSTC N93. Any future changes must be emailed to NSTC N93. Service Assignment Packages . A service assignment package is required for all N ROTC Navy Option midshipmen and STA -21 OCs . SSM who request active duty shall follow guidance in Section 4-50 . Additionally, a service assignment package is required for all MECEP students that have been approved to commission into the Navy . Once the Service Assignment File has been updated, a Serv ice Assignment Package must be assembled per the below guidance. a. Content of Individual Packages . All service assignment packages shall include the following documents: (1) OPMIS Service Assignment Unit Verification Report (GF30R17) . This report is available as soon as the file is transferred to NSTC N9; (2) Service Assignment/Duty Preference Form ; (3) Transcript (Official, if at al l possible); (4) Proof of pre -commissioning physical, (i.e., DoDMERB -approved DD-2808 or BUMED/N MOTC waiver recommendation approved ). If not approved by the date of mailing, the PNS shall indicate physical status in the remarks section of the Service Assignment Duty Preference Form . For example: (a) \"Pre-commissioning physical taken 21 May XXXX and submitted to BUMED . No indication of disqualifying physical defects.\" (b) \"Pre-commissioning physical scheduled 21 September XXXX . Entry physical and subsequent annual certifications of phys ical status indicate no disq ualifying defects will be found; \" and (5) Any application or amplifying documents required for certain requested designators. b. Administrative Processing by the Unit . All s ervice assignment packages shall be consolidated at the unit and forwarded to NSTC N93 per the guidance below: (1) Print an OPMIS Service Assignment Unit Verification Report, GF30R17 for each participating student and attach it to the top of each service assignment package; (2) Prepare one cover letter listing the name and SSN for each service assignment package . Ensure that each package beneath the cover letter is stapled separately . NROTC units with SSM may be required to prepare two or three separate cover letters . One cover letter shall address all NROTC NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-44 midshipmen . The second cover letter shall address all STA -21 OCs (target and core option/MECEP approva ls). The third cover letter shall address SSM who request active duty; (3) IRR Hardship Waiver and Volunteer Requests as well as all Graduate Study LOA Request Notifications should be submitted with the service assignment package; and (4) The deadline for final update of the OPMIS Service Assignment Form wil l be provided annually by Official Mail M essage . c. Commissionin g. Students will normally be assigned a URL designator upon commissioning . Specific goals and policy decisions r egarding assignments to URL and RL/SC designators are promulgated annually by NPC based on the needs of the Navy . PERS-8 will provide the unit the commissioning documents needed for officer appointment, provided the student's name appears on an approved regular or reserve commissioning scroll provided by N93. 4-47 Individual Ready Reserve (IRR ) Some newly commissioned Navy Option NROTC midshipmen may be required to commission into the IRR prior to beginning active duty and communit y-specific post -accession training . NSTC will provide information regarding the IRR, including the policies, processes, and schedule for that year -group . CNSTC is the approval authority for hardship waivers requesting exemption from the IRR. 4-48 Marine Guaranteed Flight Option Service assignment or duty assignment for MECEPs and Marine Option midshipmen is normally conducted at TBS. However, MECEPs and Marine Option midshipmen may apply for guaranteed assignment to an aviation MOS after they have completed the requirements in Appendix Q. The goal of this program is to pr e-designate students for av iation service a few years before their commissioning in order to best control and anticipate recruiting requirements. Marine Option midshipmen previously awarded an aviation guarantee through another source (e.g ., PLC) must reapply . The application package must be endorsed by the MOI and P NS and forwarded directly to MCRC (ON/E) no later than 30 September. Application packages shall include: a. Official Photograph NAVPERS 1070/884 ; b. Information Sheet (NSTC 1533/62); c. DoDMERB physical (unless a senior); d. Eye refraction with depth perception and color blind testing; e. Report of Medical Examination DD 2808 ; f. Anthropometric Data Record, NAVMED 6410/9 ; and g. Contact Lens Statement. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 4-45 Typically, aviation gu arantees are granted freshman through junior year . However, the opportunity to commission with an aviation MOS is not completely closed to Marine seniors . If a senior desires an aviation MOS, they need to have a n NMOTC -approved flight physical with their Request For Appointment (RFA) or commissioning package and meet all other aviation requirements . If billets are available for that fiscal y ear and the student has requested aviation on their RFA, they may be selected for a commission with an aviation MOS . However, the RFA is the final point to request commissioning with an aviation MOS unless the needs of the Marine Corps dictate otherwise. 4-49 Nuclear Screening and Application The Navy is highly interested in students who want to purs ue a career either as a nuclear -trained officer in the F leet or as an engineer at Naval Reactors (NR) . To increase each student's opportunity to enter these fields, the PNS shall encourage them to pursue technical majors within Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories, complete calculus and physics requirements early, participate in applicable Summer Training, and apply for an interview at the earliest opportunity. The screening of applicants for nuclear service is in addition to the service assignment procedures . a. Midshipmen an d STA -21 Core Officer Candidates . Interested students can submit an NNPP Application to NSTC N91 once all calculus and physics requirements are met and the student is within two years of graduation , in accordance with MILPERSMAN 1520 -050 (series ). b. STA -21 Nuclear Option Officer Candidates . STA -21(N) OCs are required to submit a n NNPP application once within a year and a half of graduation in preparation for interview in the summer before their graduation. Additionally, an interview preparation p lan must be submitted to N91 for each STA - 21(N) OC in the February prior to the summer the OC will be interviewing. The following additional documents shall be included with the application upon submission: a.

Examples where administrative leave may be granted include extreme weather, extended power failure, machine breakdowns , or physical closure of a building . Granting administrative leave when t he building or office in which the employee works is \"physically closed\" is widely misinterpreted . When a unit or institution limits operations during a school break, it does not mean that the building is physically closed if other members of the unit sta ff such as duty offic ers and telephone watches have access to th e building . The building must be physically closed and the employee denied access to the work place in order to grant administrative leave . Some examples of physical closure of a building would be if the host school shuts off the heat or el ectricity duri ng winter break , or declares the building closed and forbids entry . In such a case, administrative leave may be authorized . The PNS has authority to grant administrative leave for unplanned contingencies up to three consecutive work days.

Monthly testing . An echelon 2 waiver is in place that allows units to test twice a month rather than four times a month. Annual Testing a. New Student Sweep . All new students must be tested within 30 days of joining the unit . Typically this testing occurs during new student orientation at the beginning of the academic year . This also NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-17 satisfies the annual requirement . These new students will also be subject to random urinalysis each month during the academic year. b. End of Year Sweep . OPNAVINST 535 0.4 (series ) requires commands to \"review all personnel onboard who were not tested during the fiscal year and conduct a unit sweep of all those personnel prior to the end of the fiscal year.\" As students attend their host schools based on an academic year , a waiver is in place to conduct end of year midshipman sweeps based on the academic year . This means that any midshipman who was not tested in the past year must be tested within the first 30 days of the fall semester . For example, any midshipman who w as not selected for random urinalysis during the sophomore year must be tested within the first 30 days of the junior year . For active duty members, end of year sweeps are still based on fiscal year. c. End of year sweeps, though conducted in the fall, satisfy the annual requirement for the previous academic year and therefore are not considered in the end of year sweep the following fall. For example, a College Program Basic student tested upon entering the program as a freshman, would be subject to random urinalysis during the freshman and sophomore years, and to an end of academic year sweep during the first 30 days of the junior year if the midshipman was selected for Advanced Standing or a side-load scholarship and was not selected for random u rinalysis during the second academic year. Urinalysis Program Coordinators (UPCs) Observers .

UPCs must be designated in w riting by the CO or OIC and may not also be the command Drug and Alcohol Program Advisor (DAPA) . Observers shall sign the Urinalysis Observer Briefing Sheet available in the UPC handbook and can include Air Force or Army active duty personnel from a co -located ROTC unit . The UPC will keep the DD2624, UPC Ledger, and Observer Briefing Sheets on file for two years. Unit UPCs will use current Navy Drug Screenin g Program (NDSP) software to administer the urinalysis program . NROTC UPCs must send urinalysis samples to the appropriate Navy Drug Screening Laboratory and will ship samples by FEDEX, using the FEDEX government rate . It is required that the UPC complet e the Urinalysis Program Coordinator course, CPPD -UPC -011-1.2, available in the eLearning section of Navy Knowledge Online . Additional program information for UPCs is available at the Navy Drug Detection and Deterrence Website https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers - npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/DDD/Pages/default.aspx . Units may enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to receive UPC services f rom a nearby unit such as a Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC). A sample urinalysis MOU is available from the NSTC Alcohol and Drug Control Officer (ADCO). All urinalysis MOUs must be sent for review to t he NSTC N4 and NSTC ADCO prior to signature. For units that do not enter into an MOU, the Urinalysis Program Coordinator OPGuide is available https://www.public.navy.mil/buper s- npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/DDD/policy/Pages/HandbooksandGuides.aspx . Control Officer (ADCO) . The NSTC ADCO is responsible for monitoring the unit urinalysis programs throughout the NSTC domain and will monitor the status of all positive test results in the domain . The NSTC ADCO will provide guidance to unit UPCs regarding current CNETC - directed testing rates. COs. When a unit is notified of a positive drug test result, OPNAVINST 5350.4 (series ) states the \"commanding officer must make an initial decision on whether the member's drug use was wrongful.\" OICs, as they are not COs, must forward all available information to have CNSTC make this determination . If the CO makes a determination of \"wron gful\" drug use, the unit shall begin the process for administrative separation or disenrollment . No PRB is required to remove a College Program Basic NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-18 midshipman from the program, however the NSTC ADCO must be provided written record of the action taken, i.e. a copy of a notification letter to the midshipman . If the CO makes a determination that the incident is not drug abuse, the CO will send a letter to OPNAV 170 (incorrectly identified as OPNAV 135 in the OPNAVINST) . A sample lette r is provided in Appendix D to e nclosure (2) of OPNAVINST 5350.4 (series ). The letter to OPNAV 170 must be routed via CNSTC so that the NSTC ADCO may properly track the results of all positive test results. Commissioning Physical Urinalysis . The urinalysis test given during a student's commissioning physical is not an official test . Among other things, this test does not have the necessary chain of custody requirements . Although an investigation should be conducted to determine the circumstances that resulted in the positive test result, the test by itself may not be the basis for any administrative action. 5-33 Suicide Prevention The PNS will conduct a Suicide Prevention Program in accordance with OPNAVINST 1720.4 (series ). Suicide prevention training shall be conducted at least annually for all active duty service members . Suicide prevention training should be included in GMT for midshipmen. 5-34 Voting Assistance The PNS shall maintain a program encouraging voter participation in accordance with OPNAVINST 1742.1 (series ). Note: NAVADMIN 168/17 eliminated the Voting Officer requirement, but Title 10 (10 USC Section 1566f) and DODI 1000.04 of 13 Sep 12 still require Voting Assistance to date. 5-35 Navy Family Accountability and Assessment System (NFAAS) The NFA AS system permits the Navy to account, manage, and monitor the recovery process for personnel and their families affected by a wide -spread catastrophic event . Each unit shall appoint a primary and secondary NFAAS Coordinator . Both coordinators shall have unit administrative r ights within the NFAAS system and are responsible for overseeing all unit NFAAS musters . NFAAS is accessible at https://navyfamily.navy.mil. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-19 5-36 Public Affairs Public Affairs Program . Because of its proximity to young people on the college campus, the NROT C unit has a distinct advantage in creating and promoting a favorable image of the United States Navy and Marine Corps to those men and women who will shape both the Naval Service and the country's future . The presence of NROTC units on campuses across th e nation positions the Navy and Marine Corps in highly visible areas of public opinion . The ability of the Naval Service to obtain public support for its overall mission is affect ed by the effectiveness of the unit level public affairs program . Every uni t's public affairs program additionally supports the Navy and Marine Corps recruiting efforts and is particularly important in the era of the All -Volunteer Force . NSTC recognizes this unique opportunity and is ready to assist each NROTC unit in developing a vigorous public affairs program . Three parties are principals to this end: the NSTC Public Affairs Officer (PAO), the unit PAO, and the university or college PAO . Units should directly liaise with the NSTC PAO . All correspondence between the unit and NSTC PAO must include NSTC N93 as an info recipient . Close cooperation with the campus public affairs operation will mean better contacts with the public simply by virtue of continuity . This section provides guidel ines to the NROTC unit PAO for developing and implementing a dyna mic public affairs program . It is based on the directives and information contained in SECNAVINST 5720.44 (series ) The NROTC unit's public affairs program revolves around three core areas: Internal Relations (Command Information), Community Relations, and Public Information (Media Relations) . Using this priority, there are \"target audiences\" within these core area s that should be identified and addressed. a. Internal Relations (1) For the NROTC unit, Internal Relations should be the forefront of a public affairs program because the students are the focal point of the entire NROTC Program . Good communication wi th the battalion presents a thre e-fold opportunity: (a) To pass the word on all aspects of the Navy and Marine Corps from SECNAV to the Battalion Commander, including the elimination of rum ors, doubts, and misinformation; (b) As an educational tool, to impress on future Navy and Marine Corps officers the value of good commu nication and how it is achieved; and (c) To strengthen the confidence of each student in both the NROTC P rogram and the Navy/Marine Corps, this contributes to a solid group of \"ambassad ors\" on ca mpus and in home communities. (2) Four target audiences exist for the NROT C unit Internal Navy Relations P rogram: the battalion, the family members of the students, the unit staff, and the Navy and Marine Corps . The Internal Navy Relations P rogram should pr imarily educate and inform, report and interpret, recognize individual and group accomplishments, and develop unit pride and esprit de corps with these audiences . At the unit level, the printed word and face -to-face dialogue are considered the two most wi dely used and convenient methods of communication . A variety of channels for internal relationships exist, such as: (a) Print Media . The Plan of the Day (POD) is the most common example of a print medium in the Navy and M arine Corps . It is considered best for a listing of daily routine, sometimes modified, but not to be relied upon for any sort of i n-depth ne ws or as a channel for feedback; and NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-20 (b) Newspapers . A unit newspaper is best suited to reach three of the target audiences (students, unit staff, and fa mily members) with maximum effect . The newspaper may contain a broad range of news from DoD to Navy/Marine Corps to NETC, but primary emphasis should be on the unit . If guest editorials and letters to the editor are used, the newspaper will be an invalua ble means of total unit communication, allowing thoughts, opinions, and ideas to flow up and down \"the chain of command.\" A regular feature of it should be input from the PNS who can use it to discuss topics of current interest and value to the unit. 1. Editorial Staff . An editorial staff composed of students should be appointed from volunteers and tasked with publishing a newspaper at least four times per academic year. 2. Unit Newspaper . The unit newspaper need not be large, but should be comprehensive in that it consistently represents the students, their family members, and unit staff . For critiques of your newspaper's performance in the areas of news coverage, compare it with those from other units and/or contact the NSTC PAO for a more in-depth review. 3. Funding . A unit newspaper can be fund ed by unit OMN funds; however , if OMN funds are used, advertising may not be included . There are three publ ications that provide guidance on printing regulations: Department of the Navy Publicat ions and Printing Regulations, the Navy Ship and Station Newspaper Handbook, and the Navy Civilian Enterprise Publications Handbook . Funding and publication by a stu dent non-federal organization or the university should be encouraged. 4. Appropriated/non -Appropriated Funding . The Department of the Navy Regulations and Printing Regulations require that no Navy publication or printed matter, prepared or produced with either appropriated or no n-appropriated funds or identified with any activ ity of the Department of the Navy, shall contain any advertisement inserted by or for any private individual, firm, or corporation; or contain material which implies in any manner that the Department of the Navy endorses or favors any specific commercial product, commodity, or service . Units desiring to advertise in local publications shall do so in conjunction with local Navy Talent Acquisition Group or Recruiting District ( NTAG or NRD ) advertising staff. (c) Unit Yearbook . The yearbook is a valuable capsul e of the year's events and is usually very popular among students . Funding for this type of publication is authorized through student/battalion organizations only; use of official funds for this purpose is not authorized. (d) Unit Website . NROTC host universities own and control the Department of Naval Science departmental websites . These websites reside in the .edu do main and are located on the university's server; however, NSTC PAO and Chief Information Officer ( CIO) will monitor and provide recommendations on the content of these departmental websites . These departmental sites are not official Navy websites and should not claim to be . They should also not state they are \"unofficial\" Navy websites as this implies they are unapproved . Website topics are limitless and can include everything from the military medical system to the unit's schedule for drill periods and the reason behind it . The website may include information such as instructor names and office contact information, if such information is published on other departmental websites . Answering the most often asked questions via one of these methods will lessen correspondence and telephone calls . Data available to the general public must be in accordance with Privacy Act regula tions . If a unit also maintains a website which resides in the .mil domain and is located on a Navy server, it must be identified as an \"Official Navy Website\", and the PNS must ensure it complies with the regulations outlined in Chapter 7 of the DoN Public Affairs Policy and Regulations, SECNAVINST 5 720.44 (series ). NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-21 (e) The Unit Brochure . Contingent upon available resources, each NROTC unit should publish a unit brochure for public affairs, recruiting, and student orientation . The brochure should include these areas: 1. An overview of the NROTC mission; 2. A description of the host university or college and how the unit fi ts in as an academic department; 3. A description of the unit staff and battalion organization and size; 4. A capsule summary of the NROTC Program, especially if cross -town enrollments are available; 5. A description of special activities, such as field trips, NROTC drill, rifle, or pistol teams, social events, community activities, and athletic events; 6. The details of where to find the unit on campus and how to cont act it by phone, mail, or email; and 7. Photographs are attractive in such a brochure, but are not required . An offset printing at a commercial printer is considered mo st suitable for such a brochure. (f) Audio -Visual Media 1. Navy/Marine Corps News This Week . Each NROTC unit should encourage students to view this program each week . It is an excellent vehicle for keeping students up -to-date on fleet events, policies and programs . Navy/Marine Corps News This Week is available online from the Navy Broadcastin g Service, Washington, D.C . under the \"News\" tab at http://www.navy.mil/index.asp . 2. Unit Presentation . Every NROTC unit and maritime academy should have a unit presentation . The presentation is a good method of describing the NROTC Program to new students and their parents and should double as an effective recruiting tool. 3. Bulletin Board . Every NROTC unit and maritime academy should devote one highly accessible bulleti n board for material that is not reproduced in the unit newspaper . Such material should include: a. Navy Editor Service Clipsheet ; b. Material from Navy Birthday Kits/Captain's Call ; and c. Armed Forces Press Service Clipsheet (from Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs ) 4. Fleet Hometown News Program (FHTNP) . The value of an active FHTNP cannot be overemphasized . An NROTC unit or maritime academy can more effectively generate positive publicity via FHTNP than any other vehicle . Information on how to orga nize and exe cute a viable FHTNP is available in the FHTNP \"How to\" Guide. NSTC -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-22 5. Captain's Call . By virtue of classroom time and drill periods, much time is available at an NROTC unit for face -to-face communication . Regularly scheduled \"Captain's Calls\" are most benefi cial to deal directly with the students and the staff on the broad range of Navy and Marine Corps issues. b. Internal Relations Outside the Unit . The remaining segment of the internal relations responsibility relates to the rest of the Navy and Marine Corps . These two target audiences should be informed of significant events, plans, programs, and accom plishments of the NROTC program . Community Relations a. General . Strong campus and community support is the most expeditious means of developing public awareness of the Navy and Marine Corps on a local level . It is also the simplest means of enhancing the Department of the Navy's recruiting efforts. b. Any community relations program organized and executed by an NROTC PAO should include the following components: (1) Community Liaison . Liaison with community organizations, particularly those affiliated with the military: Navy League, Naval Reserve Association, American Legion, Marine Corps Associations, Veterans of Fo reign Wars, Coast Guard Au xiliary, etc . is encouraged . When interacting with such organizations, take care not to endorse any no n-federal entity . Questions regarding what constitutes such endorsement should be directed to the NSTC Ethics Counselor, code N STC OGC, who can be reach ed at (847) 688 -4422. (2) Extracurricular Activities . Participation by the unit drill team, color guard, or a representative group of students and staff in campus and community activities such as parades, athletic events, etc . is encouraged. (3) Open House/Orientations . Annual open houses and orientation tours should be scheduled with the concurrence of the host institution . Both local citizens and campus residents should be invited . The event need not be complicated . A presentation on the NROTC un it and a demonstration of equipment on hand promotes public understanding . These tours are invaluable in tying the mission of the unit and the Naval Service to the public interest. (4) Community Relations Outreach Program . Community relations will be enhanc ed by visible community service and humanitarian projects . As an example, several inner city NROTC units sponsor a campus -wide collection of toys for children to be donated to local inner city hospitals . Other potential projects include volunteer work in learning centers and campus ecology projects . The volunteers for these projects should be readily identifiable as NROTC students . Student s should be encouraged to wear naval uniforms to allow maximum recognition of the local NROTC unit's participation . In organizing these events, units must be aware that they cannot sponsor an event which \"directly or indirectly benefits or favors...any private individual, commercial venture, sect, political or fraternal group\", as published in the Navy Public Affairs R egulations, \"Fund Raising Events .\" Care shall be taken in such events not to violate federal ethics guidelines . When in doubt, contact the NSTC Ethics Counselor, Code NSTC OGC at (847) 688-4422. (5) Scholarship Awards . Some of the best opportunities for public recognition occur in conjunction with NRC activities . For example, NTAG s normally will arrange for presentation of NROTC scholarship awards to recipients at high school commencements or award ceremonies and are NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-23 usually more than happy to have the PNS make the presentation . These presentations can be particularly effective if the recipient is a prospective member of the unit. (6) Annual Events . NROTC units typically sponsor various social events during the year that should include prominent members of the community whenever possible . When organizing an awards banquet, mess n ight, or a Navy Birthday Ball, ensure university and local civic, industrial, and religious leaders are invited to participate when appropriate. (7) Speakers Bureau . Face -to-face communication with other students and the local civilian community generates awareness, understanding, and support not only for the unit but the Navy and Marine Corps as well . In order to accomplish this, every NROTC unit's Speakers Bureau should consist of the PNS, the XO , and selected students . For this plan, students may be more effectively employed as speakers to groups in their hometowns during breaks in the academic year . Potential audiences include students, faculty, and parent groups on the college, high school, and primary school level; local businessmen's associations such as the Lions Club, Elks, Rotary, Jaycees, etc.; and military affiliates such as the American Legion, VFW, and MOAA. (8) Other Activities . The Navy Public Affairs Regulations discuss at least three other special programs well within the capability of an NROTC unit: (a) Exhibits of N avy and Marine Corps combat art; (b) Guest cruises for high -ranking university officials and civic leaders; and (c) Allowing certain groups ( e.g., Navy League, Naval Reserve Associations) use of the unit wardroom for monthly meetings. Public Information a. General . Every NROTC unit and maritime academy should have a systematic and regular means of publicizing news of unit programs, events, and achievements to the campus and community . The unit should work closely with the host institution to demonstrate support for the goals of the university . The university's public affairs office maintains contacts with med ia representatives in the area . This relationship allows the unit to function as a university or college department while utilizing a single source of media contact . In smaller communities or universities, such an office may not exist, or the public info rmation office of the host institution may not be capable of meeting the needs of the unit . In this case, the NROTC unit or maritime academy may need to organize and execute a public information program. b. Media Relations . Like Internal Relations and Community Relations, a strong Public Information Program is an asset to the NROTC unit as it generates awareness and support for the unit. However, it is more difficult than the other two programs to execute because it is less accessible and more tim e consuming . Stories of value to editors from the average NROTC unit center mostly on a highly visible drill team or unit marching, special occasions such as awards ceremonies or mess nights, presentations at local high schools, and significant unit accom plishments . In cases where adverse media coverage is likely, all releases must be coordinated between the PNS (or OIC), N04, and NSTC PAO (or CNSTC, depending on severity) . c. Queries . All media queries should be referred to the NSTC PAO . Advise NSTC N9 when this occurs. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-24 d. Feedback Procedures . The ability of each NROTC unit to sell itself to the community in a manner which is credible and professional is a matter of interest to NSTC . Since NROTC units do not have public affairs sp ecialists and the officers that serve in the billet do so as a collateral duty, the experiences of one unit may be helpful to another . Units that have instituted programs that are unique and particularly successful should share the \"best practice\" with ot her units and forward a copy to NSTC PAO and NSTC N93. e. Information Provided to the University . The PNS/OIC may furnish the host institution with information about the department and the students enrolled in the program as appropriate . Informati on related to special activities and accomplishments of members of the NRO TC unit, such as visits to Navy and Marine Co rps installations and assignments to special programs such as flight, submarine, and nuclear power, may be included . Provide copies of t hese reports to NSTC PAO, as appropriate. f. VIP Visits . The PNS shall notify NSTC N9 in advance of visits to the NROTC unit by flag/general officers or civilians of the equivalent rank . The PNS should forward a n after action summary report to NSTC N9S and PAO as soon as possible following the visit. If a 3 -star FOGO/civilian equivalent or higher visits and anything significant is discussed, contact commander NSTC by phone in addition to the below summary. Util ize the following VISIT: COMMENTS: In addition, all past, present and projected future visits will be reported via e -mail in the following format in a Microsoft Excel Document: NROTC Unit 2016 Visits 2017 Visits 2018 Visits 2019 Visits 2020 Visits Planned Future Visits BU/MIT None ADM Raymond Spruance (14 May 17 ) GEN George Marshall (3-4 Dec 17 ) Lt. Gen. Lewis Puller (12-13 May 18) RADM Cozad (8 Jun 18 ) None g. Media Issues . Units shall contact NSTC when issues arise which appear to have potential media interest, specifically if the issue is controversial, politically sensitive, or could require NSTC action . When local media produce items that relate to the NROTC Program o r DoD policies, copies should be forwarded to NSTC. 5-37 Funding for NROTC Advertising CNRC provides funds to Commanders, Navy Recruiting Regions for the support of the PNS . These funds are administered by the COs of NTAG s or N RDs in whose recruiting territo ry the NROTC units are located . Expenditures must be approved by the N TAG or NRD CO prior to obligation of funds by the NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-25 PNS. These funds shall be used for local advertising and direct mail expenses incurred by the PNS while recruiting for the NROTC Progr am. These funds will not be used for the production of internal publications for use by the NROTC unit or the procurement of services and materials not related to NROTC Program advertising . Advertising expenditures are restricted to the purchase of newsp aper and magazine space, creative production , and direct mail only . This precludes the purchase of any recruiting aids (e.g., key chains, bumper stickers, patches , etc. ) and radio, television, and outdoor advertising. There are several interrelated objectives which should be achieved when obligating the advertising funds: a. Identification of potential Scholarship and College Program candidates, especially potential nuclear power candidates; and b. Identification of potential NROTC Nurs e Corps Scholarship candidates. The PNS should place advertising in cos t-efficient media that generates the most inquiries concerning the NROTC Program and the unit . Units desiring advertising assistance may contact their recruiting district or recruitin g area public affairs officer. 5-38 Recreation Funds As Naval commands, NROTC units may maintain a Morale, Welfare , and Recreation (MWR) Fund for active duty personnel, including both staff and active duty students . Expenditure of MWR funds must benefit active duty personnel only; NROTC midshipmen are prohibited from participating in such funds . An annual grant request letter, including the exact number of active duty staff and active duty students actually onboard as of 30 September must be provided to Commander, Naval Installation Command (CNIC) , N948D . An annual finan cial statement shall also be provided in accordance with CNIC guidance. The establishment of a Student Recreation Fund is authorized . This fund must be generated from local sources and separated at all times from the MWR fund . No report of a Student Recreation Fund is required by BUPER S. 5-39 National Scholarship Applicants Officer Interviews NROTC unit staff member s will conduct officer interviews for students applying for a National Scholarship . While NROTC u nits cannot conduct the interviews for all the applica nts to the National Scholarship, units will coordinate with their local N TAG s or N RDs in order to conduct interviews to the maximum extent possible . There is no requirement for the applicant to have listed a school at a unit as one of their five school choices in order for the unit to conduct the interview . These interviews maybe set up by the local recruiter or may be done for an applicant who walks in \"off the street\" during a campus visit. Units should conduct the Officer Interview for any College Program midshipmen applying for the National Scholarship . These interviews may be conducted by the PNS, the XO , or other staff officer at the discretion of the PNS. Units who conduct the interviews at a local recruiting station are authorized to us e the unit's Government Owned Vehicle (GOV ) for transportation to the recruiting station . The GOV may be parked at the recruiting station overnight . NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-26 5-40 Host University Assessments and NROTC Excellence Awards Host University Assessments are conducted annually and will be metrically based to support awarding the DoD ROTC and Educational Institution Partnership Excellence Awards IAW DoDINST 1215.08 (Series) Quality, demography, resources, and community i nvolvement are the listed performance criteria for the unit. Educational Institution Support (also called university support) evaluate s quality of life, unit morale and esprit de corps, facilities and environment, and security. The ROTC and Educational Institution Partnership Excellence Award Program provides an opportunity for recognition of universities that go above and beyond to faci litate success of the NROTC mission . The selection criteria include the above specified performance criteria and university support, as well as other noteworthy achievements. Competitive period will be from August 1 to July 31 of each year. The Navy ROT C nominations are due to the Office of Accession Policy NLT 31 January of the following year. Presentations of awards will occur in May. Host University Assessments will be provided to the PNS for discussion with university leadership. These assessments will not be provided directly to the host university from N9 so that they may be discussed face -to-face or over the phone by the PNS . 5-41 Support Agreements The NSTC Support Agreement (SA) Manager (SAM) is located in the Logistics Department (N4) and is responsible for the management of the SA Program including Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), Memorandums of Agreement (MOA), and DD Form 1144s. To ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and instructions all SAs are reviewed by NSTC prior to s ignature. In addition, an annual review is completed on each active SA. Responsibilities: a. Activity/Command will: (1) Forward each draft SA to the NSTC SAM for review before any party signs the agreement. (2) Work with the NSTC SAM to complete the N STC review of your draft SA. (3) Work between the NSTC SAM, the NSTC staff, and the other activity/command engaging in the SA, to negotiate the terms and conditions of the SA. (4) Once the draft SA has been reviewed by NSTC and returned to the activit y/command, ensure an electronic .pdf copy of the final signed SA is emailed to the NSTC SAM for archival record within 14 working days of signature of document. (5) Complete an annual review of all active SA's, when tasked by the NSTC SAM. The review will include annotating whether each SA is current, needs updating or should be cancelled. Work with the NSTC SAM if changes are required to any SAs. b. NSTC SAM will: (1) Ensure NSTC Staff review and NETC review, if required, is completed on all draft SA received. (2) Ensure draft SAs are updated per comments from the NSTC staff and NETC code and returned to the NSTC activity/command for finalization, signature, and implementation. (3) Complete an annual review of all active SAs to ensure all ter ms and conditions are still applicable, forwarding a listing of each commands active SA for review. If changes to the terms and conditions are required, work with the activity/command to ensure changes are annotated on a new SA. All questions and concer ns regarding SAs should be forwarded to the NSTC SAM, Beth Kleinschmidt, email: 2019 5-27 NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 5-28 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-1 CHAPTER 6 Performance This chapter covers performance evaluation and counseling from reporting through commissioning or disenrollment. 6-2 Student Performance File The Student Performance File is maintained by the counselor or class advisor and consists of the following documents: Left Hand Side a. All Fitness Reports and Counseling Records (NAVPERS 1610/2); b. Letters of a ppreciation, certificates , and awards; and c. Warning and probation letters, LOAs, and PRB reports. Right Hand Side a. Comprehensive Student In formation Summary (OPMIS 84 Report ), including all previous summaries ; b. Degree Completion Plan ( NSTC 1533/117 ) and as a supplement , units may add an approved degree plan from the University ; c. Academic Term Performance and Counseling Record ( NSTC 1533/11 5); and NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-2 d. Current college level academic transcripts including summer school and transfer credit including transcripts from previous semester s to mainta in history of grade forgiveness/replacement changes . 6-3 Principles of Performance Counseling The performance evaluation system facilitates reviewing academic progress and measuring a stude nt's aptitude for service as a n aval officer . The evaluation system uses periodic counseling among other tools to identify shortcomings and motivate performance improvement. The tasks of the counselor or class advisor are to direct and focus the performance of the student and to develop their professional and milit ary expertise . Before students can improve, they must know how well they are currently performi ng and what is expected of them. Counseling should be a dynamic relationship where the student feels free to discuss issues and to receive direction and guidan ce. The counselor should discuss all relevant strengths and weaknesses. The counseling session can be enhanced by: a. Determining the best time for the session and providing the student adv ance notice so they can prepare; b. Gathering in formation and relevant material; c. Having students complete a self -appraisal and gather all relevant informati on related to their performance; and d. Planning discussion points, remembering the objective is t o achieve growth in performance. 5. There are five objectives to accomplish during each counseling sessions: a. Identify the student's strengths and weaknesses . Establishing a fair, accurate, and realistic assessment of the student's performance is cr ucial to the counseling process ; b. Address specific performance problems, concentrating on ways to develop growth in these areas . Point out ways to improve, bu t do not dwell on the negatives; c. Help the students evaluate their previous goals, and establish new goals for each semester . Ensure that the goals are challen ging, realistic, and attainable; d. Ensure the students have a clear understanding of their performance and acknowledge the areas that need improvement; and e. Review what is expected of the student before the next counseling session . Make sure they understand program expectations . However, be careful not to make promises or guarantees to the midshipman regarding what the marks or recommendations will be at the end of the evaluation period. The student and advisor shall sign the counseling form . The student shall receive a copy, and the original shall be placed in the Student Performance File. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-3 6-4 Midshipman Counseling Initial Interview . The class advisor shall conduct an initial interview with each student at the beginning of each academic term . During the initial interview with the student, the class advisor will review the student's past performance, as evidenced by high school record, SAT/ACT scores, or prior college -level work . The pu rpose of the initial interview is to establish goals for the ensuing academic term and remaining college career while considering course load, past performance, extracurricular activities, outside work, and other factors that may impact an individual's per formance . The student's goals are to be noted as expected grades for scheduled courses and expected GPA for the term . The interview will include at a minimum: a. A review of the individual's Student File and Student Information maintained in OPMIS ; b. A discussion of specific program requirements and the requirement to develop or r evise an individual degree completion plan; c. A review of academic performance based on information either from the institution or from the individual, as required under the circumstances; d. Discussion that aptitude scores and scholastic achievement contribute to a student's national ranking for designator assignment and class rank (lineal number) upon commi ssioning; and e. Advice to the stude nt on their assigned billets within the battalion. Progress Counseling . The class advisor shall conduct at least one counseling session (in addition to the initial counseling session) with each student during the academic term to determine progress in meeting established goals . The number of counseling sessions depends upon the needs of the individual . The unit shall consult with the academic institution faculty advisor when the student's academic performance becomes marginal or unsatisfactory. End of Term Performance Counseling a. Upon receipt of an official grade report or transcript, the class advisor shall counsel each student on their performance in the previous academic term . This counseling session may be combined with the initial counseling session for the next term . This counseling session should identify: (1) Students who do not appear to be performing at a level commensurate with their potential as establish ed during the initial interview; (2) Students who have unsatisfactory degree progress or have unsatisfactory academic results within a program or degree requirement; and (3) Students whose individual DCP will not permit them to complete requirements within the time period indicated in their NROTC contract . Factors to consider include , but are not limited to, changes in major, option, or academic course offerings, or any physical readiness deficiencies . A revised DCP should be developed and approved during the review . This DCP may require consultation with the academic institution ac ademic advisor. b. The advisor shall debrief and have the student sign the student's most recent fitness report. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-4 c. The PNS will conduct a review of each individual's performance with the class advisor and take appropriate action to implement remedial programs, place the individual on probation, and/or hold a PRB, if required or appropriate. 6-5 Midshipman Fitness Reports The fitness report performance evaluation system provides a formal process for reviewing a student's developmental progress and measuring t heir aptitude for service as a n aval officer . Units shall complete Midshipman fitness reports on all students using Fitness Report and Counseling Record, NAVPERS 1610/2. Objectives . The objectives of midshipman Fitness Reports are to: a. Contribute to a student's national ranking for designator assignment , ship selection, aviation order of merit and disenrollment processing ; b. Identify areas for improvement and provide counsel and guidance to improve officer -like qualities; c. Give each stude nt experience performing professional observ ation and evaluation of individual performance ; and d. Rank students in their officer -like qualities for assignments to positions of authority and responsibility within the program. Raters . For the professional d evelopment of midshipmen, battalion involvement in the Fitne ss Report process is encouraged, to include providing 'Comments on Performance '. Reporting Senior . The Fitness Report shall be signed by the PNS as the Reporting Senior and the trait average assigned shall be entered into OPMIS as the midshipman's aptitude score. Timing . There are two reporting periods per year . Reports and OPMIS entries are due on 31 January and 31 Jul y of each year . Closing dates should coincide with the end of the prece ding academic term. Competitive Groups . Competitive groups are divided by program and expected fiscal year of commission . The three programs include Navy options including nurses , Marine options, and STA -21 OCs. For example, all Navy Option midshipmen with Fiscal Year 2019 ( FY2019 ) estimated commissioning dates compete only against other Navy Option, FY2019 commissioning midshipmen . The estimated fiscal year of commission for incoming freshman sh all be four years out . For those not planning to graduate in four years , the unit shall update their estimated fiscal year of commission u pon approval of extended entitlement s or other special requests . This approval normally occurs during their sophomore year. NOTE: MECEPs a re not covered by this program but are covered general under USMC requirements. Ratings . In addition to the rubric given on NAVPERS 1610/2, direction is provided for the following: a. Professional Expertise (Block 33) . This trait mark shall reflect the student's cumulative grade point average in Naval Science C ourses as follows : NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-5 NS GPA (4.0 scale) P. E. Trait Mark NS GPA < 1.50 1 1.50 <= NS GPA < 2.50 2 2.50 <= NS GPA < 3.15 3 3.15 <= NS GPA < 3.75 4 3.75 = NS GPA 5 b. Command Climate/Equal Opportunity (Block 34) . Use the rubric provided on the form substituting NROTC Program retention/attrition for Navy retention/reenlistment. c. Military Bearing/Character (Block 35) . Students on a conduct based war ning, probation, or LOA during the reporting period shall not be rated higher than ' Progressing ', 2.0, on this trait . Students failing to meet the physical readiness standards (see section 3-20 ) during the reporting period shall not be rated higher than ' Progressing ', 2.0, on this trait . A Navy PFA of 'Outstanding ' or a Marine PFT/CFT of 285 is required to receive 'Greatly Exceeds Standards ', 5.0, on this trait. d. Teamwork (Block 36). Evaluate per PNS direction consistent with the rubric provided on the form. e. Mission Accomplishment (Block 37) . This trait should reflect contributions to the battalion's mission to include billet performance and unit participation . However, strong performance and participation cannot come at the cost of their individual responsibility to the program . Students failing to make satisfactory progress toward degree completion and progra m academic requirements during the reporting period shall not be marked higher than 'Progressing ', 2.0, on this trait. f. Leadership (Block 38) . Evaluate per PNS direction consistent with the rubric provided on the form. g. Tactical Performance (Block 39) . This trait only applies to warfare qualified officer s and shall be marked 'NOB '. h. Recommendations (Block 40) . Use as the PNS directs. i. Comments (Block 41) . Comments are not required . The PNS may use this area for the professional development of those rated and those providing rating inputs . Fitness reports, including any comments, are part of the midshipm an's file . j. Promotion Recommendation (Block 42) . Rounding up to the next whole person, no more than 20% of a competitive group may be rated as 'Early Promote '. Similarly, up to 40% of a competitive group may be rated as 'Must Promote '. k. A student rated less than 3.0 in any category (Blocks 33 -38) shall receive more frequent counseling and other supervision as directed by the PNS. Summary Sheets . Summary sheets shall be prepared and held for submission at NSTC N9 request . These requests generally coincide with the convening of various boards or panels. Summer Training Aptitude . Althou gh aptitude evaluation during Summer Training is optional, OICs of each program may identify midshipmen whose performance, attitude, and motivation is clearly outstanding or substandard and notify the appropriate PNS by letter. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-6 a. Summer Training titude assessment for NROTC 1/C, 2/C, and 3/C midshipmen involves assessment of performance of duty, leadership qualities, and whole person evaluation . Evaluations may be submitted in the form of a Fitness Report or a Page 13 . The Midshipman Summer Training Manual contains the procedures for conducting the evaluations . Although optional, if completed, Summer Training aptitude grades (5.0 grade scale) shall be entered in the OPMIS Grade Screen, and the fitness report shall be placed in the individual 's Student Performance File. b. If commands hosting summer training elect to submit s hipboard evaluations of a midshipman, the command shall conduct and document the evaluation in the manner prescribed in the Summer Training Manual . These reports s hall be reviewed and signed by the ship's CO and forwarded under a transmittal letter to the respective NROTC units no later than 15 days following the midshipman's debarkation from cruise. 6-6 Active Duty Student Performance Evaluation The provisions of BUPERSINST 1610.10 (series ) and MCO P1610.7 (series ) apply as appropriate for active duty students, including those in the STA -21 and MECEP programs . IAW with the Performance Evaluation System ( PES), MECEP reports are to be Not Observed reports as are all formal school reports. STA -21 students will normally have a Class Advisor as Rater, XO as Senior Rater, and CO as Reporting Senior (RS) . Statements concerning aptitude, potential for service as an officer, military bearing, and evaluation of potential for completing the program should be included as remarks. Forward copies of STA -21(N) student evaluations to NSTC N91 that contain adverse comments or on which a student elects to make a statement. For students in a DUINS status only, a report may be delayed up to three months to the en d of an academic period, provided it is submitted in time for any selection board for which the member may be eligible . This delay is an exception to the general rule against delay of periodic reports. See Chapter 8 of BUPERSINST 1610.10 (series ). For MECEP students, when possible, both the RS and Reviewing Officer (RO) shall be a Marine Corps officer . The RS will normally be the MOI . The RO will normally be the CO, unless the CO is USN and the XO is USMC . In this situation, the RO should be the XO . Senior Marine, NETC will conduct Third Officer sightings on MECEP adverse reports . IAW with the PES, MECEP reports are to be Not Obse rved reports as are all formal school reports. The RS and RO may still make comments to the academic standing and achievements in the selected narrative sections of the Fitness Report . For USMC reports, the RS will submit the complete report via the Auto mated -Performance Evaluation System (A -PES) accessed through the Marine Online (MOL) website or hard copy (with three signed copies of page 5) to the RO . The RS should also forward a summary of performance and copies of commendatory letters . Commendatory , derogatory , or administrative material will not be forwarded to Commandant of the Marine Corps as attachments to the fitness reports . This material must be sent to CMC (MMSB -20) under a separate cover letter for inclusion in the Marine's Official Milita ry Personnel File (OMPF). 6-7 Warning, Probation, and Leave of Absence When counseling fails to correct substandard performance as defined in Chapter 3, the actions below should be considered . Appendix B provides guidelines on the level of action in response to common NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-7 issues . Unless clear from the onset that neither an LOA nor a recommenda tion for disenrollment is being considered, a PRB is required. Warning . Warning is the first level of disciplinary action for students who have failed to achieve or maintain program standards . Warning require s an OPMIS entry , counseling and documentatio n in the Student Performance File . The PNS shall issue a letter notifying any student placed on warning , and the letter shall be acknowledged by the student with date and signature . The warning letter shall state precisely the nature of the concern, identify remedial actions required of the student, outline assistance available , and warn that failure to correct the deficiencies or identification of further deficiencies may result in probation, LOA, or disenrollment . The decision to place a student on warning is at PNS discretion and does not require a PRB. a. Academic Warning . The conditions stated in the academic warning letter shall include participation in a mandatory study hall consisting of a minimum of unit or academic institution -superv ised study and weekly counseling with the class advisor . Mandatory study hours should be flexible to encourage individual time management and shall not exceed 15 hours per week . Mandatory study hall hours may include the student's tutoring session, time spent in the computer lab, and other similar time approved by the class advisor . The academic warning letter shall address where the student can obtain additional assistance and state that continued poor academic performance may result in probation, LOA, or disenrollment. b. Aptitude Warning . The concerns stated in the warning letter should also be documented in the student's counseling worksheet or fitness report. See 3 -19 regarding aptitude standards. c. Physical Readiness Warning . A student may be placed on physical readiness warning based on substandard performance on a mock or official PFA or swim test . Direction to participate in FEP or to seek qualified swim instruction is generally appropriate. Probation . Probation is an administrative tool . It shall have no effect on the student incurring a service obligation or the student's receipt of NROTC benefits . The PNS shall issue a letter notifying any student placed on probation and the letter shall be acknowledged by the stud ent with date and signature . The probation letter shall state precisely the nature of the concern, identify remedial actions required of the student, and warn that failure to correct the deficiencies or identification of further deficiencies may result in LOA, or disenrollment . An OPMIS entry is required when a student is placed in a probationary status . In no case shall a student be placed on probation for more than two consecutive terms for the same deficiency without approval of NSTC N9, especially ap plicable in the cases of midshipmen who are about to enter obligated status . Although continuation of probation beyond one term is an option that may be exercised by the PNS, a more appropriate action may be LOA or disenrollment . The decision to place a student on probation is at PNS discretion and only requires a PRB if requested by the student. a. Academic Probation . Once the academic term has ended, the student will be re -evaluated . A second term of academic probation is not prohibited but should only be considered when reasonable certainty exists that the student will overcome their difficulties. b. Aptitude Probation . See 3 -19 regarding aptitude standards. P robation letters shall specify the nature of the perfor mance concerns and required actions to remediate . If any doubt exists regarding aptitude for service, the unit should consider LOA or disenrollment . Aptitude probation shall not be assigned for more than one term. c. Disciplinary Probation . Gener ally, disciplinary probation is assigned to students who commit a single major offense, as defined in 3 -19, which does not warrant disenrollment . Such violations may NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-8 include minor in possession of alcohol , underage drinking, plagiarism, or similar offenses . This type of probation should not be assigned to those who have exhibited a pattern of misconduct . Since this type of probation is designed to provide an opportunity to develop core values and improve moral reasoning, it should not normally be assigned to seniors who do not have time to be remediated before graduation . (1) The PNS may place students on disciplinary probation in lieu of disenrollment if it is believed the student can learn from their mistake and correct their actions . The PNS will administer the remedial aspects of the probation and assign a member of the staff to serve as an advisor . The class advisor will then notify the student being placed on probation of probation requirements . Upon completion of the remediation period, the a dvisor should state whether the individual successfully completed the remediation program or whether disenrollment is recommended. (2) The student may be required to complete additional selected readings during their period of remediation that will cause them to reflect on correct values . The student may also be tasked with preparing a written paper relating to ethics and character . The readings and writing project should be tailored to the individual student's specific transgression and be reasonably relate d to the deficiency to be remediated . The student may be required to keep a journal discussing their reflections concerning the remediation efforts and progress. d. Physical Readiness . Any student placed on probation for deficiencies in physical f itness or body composition should be assigned to a FEP. A student with swim deficiencies should obtain assistance from qualified swim instructors . The terms of probation should state that any repeat failure could result in LOA or disenrollment . A second term of physical fitness probation is not prohibited but should only be considered when significant improvement has been noted and reasonable certainty exists that the student will overcome their difficulties. LOA . LOA is an administrative tool which suspends . Performance -related LOAs are discussed below . Other types of LOAs are discussed in Section 4-28. When considering circumstances for which this manual directs an LOA, the PRB must verify said circumstances before recommending LOA . The decision to place a student on LOA is at the PNS di scretion and, unless an exception is provided below, requires a PRB. The PNS shall issue a letter notifying any student placed on LOA and shall be acknowledged by the student with date and signature. The letter shall state precisely the nature of the concern, identify remedial actions required of the student, and warn that failure to correct the deficiencies or identification of further deficiencies may result in disenrollment. a. Interim LOA . The PNS may assign interim LOA pe nding further investigation. (1) A PRB should be held as soon as possible after assigning an interim LOA . Situations where this may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, a midshipman failing to meet program requirements by the end of their freshman year or a student charged with a crime by civil authorities that is a major offense as defined in 3 -19. If the board recommends an LOA, and the PNS concurs, the interim status will transition to a regular LOA. (2) A PRB is not required for interim LOAs issued for any midshipman who is being investigated, charged with, or is pending prosecution for any infraction which might lead to disenrollment on disciplinary grounds . Place the student on interim LOA until the matter is fully resolved and consult NSTC N93 and NSTC Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) . Ensure associated OPMIS entries are made. (a) If the midsh ipman is convicted of a crime considered a major offense as defined in 3 -19, a PRB must be held to consider disenrollment from the program . If the midshipman is incarcerated, hold the PRB in absentia . The midshipman shall be notified of the pending PRB and provided a copy of the NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-9 preliminary inquiry . Once the PRB is held and endorsed by t he PNS, the midshipman shall receive a copy of the PRB report and its endorsements. (b) Midshipmen found not guilty or exonerated of criminal charges, may be removed from LOA and allowed to continue in the program or receive their commission . A PRB may still be held, however, to examine the circumstances surrounding the event and assess the midshipman's behavior and aptitude for service . In the event the unit has already received commissioning documents for the midshipman, use those same documents to confer the commission (unless it is determined that disenrollment processing is appropriate). The effective date will remain the original date of commissioning for time -in-grade purposes . (3) If a midshipman claims to be a conscientious objector, the PNS shall as sign interim LOA and will follow Navy regulations for active duty personnel by processing for disenrollment in consultation with NSTC N93 and the NSTC SJA. b. Academic LOA . may be placed on LOA due to unsat isfactory academic performance or when it appears that the midshipman may not complete the program . If the midshipman is still academically deficient at the end of one term on LOA, the PNS shall recommend either an extension or academic disenrollment . All requests for extensions shall be submitted to NSTC N93 in letter form . The PNS shall include a statement of facts and a copy of the midshipman's most current transcript and degree completion plan. c. Aptitude LOA . A midshipman may be placed on LOA for continued or significant deficiencies in aptitude as defined in 3 -19. d. Disciplinary LOA . A disciplinary LOA is g enerally given for a major offense, as defined in 3 -19, when the PNS does not recommend disenroll ment. e. Physical Readiness LOA . An LOA for Physical Readiness must be based on an official PFA/PFT/CFT or swim test . A PRB should review the administration of the test and accuracy of the results being considered in addition to the other aspects of midshipman performance . Students who fail to adhere to physical readiness standards but demonstrate significant improvement may be granted a second probation. 6-8 UCMJ and Administrative Separations Midshipmen fall under the UCMJ only when assigned to active duty, normally during Summer Training . Although midshipmen are subject to the UCMJ regulations while on summer cruise, midshipmen suspected of any infraction are normally returned to their home NROTC unit for disciplinary or administrative action . If a midshipman is sent home from summer cruise or other active duty periods due to disciplinary reasons, NROTC unit COs are requ ired to officially contact the F leet command from which they were detached and acknowledge the mids hipman's return and inform the F leet that appropriate actions are being taken . It is inappropriate, however, to discuss the exact nature of the actions taken . In cases of misconduct by midshipm en, the PNS will normally us e administrative remedies (e.g., warning, probation, LOA, di senrollment) . If circumstances warrant, after consultation with the NSTC SJA, the PNS may request the midshipman be recalled to active duty for trial by court martial. Midshipmen are not eligible for non -judicial punishment. OCs are always subject to th e UCMJ . In cases of misconduct by OCs, the PNS may conduct NJP or refer the charges to trial by court martial after consultation with the NSTC SJA. The PNS may also NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-10 convene an Administrative Separations Board to determine whether the individual is suitable for continued service. Although any finding of guilt during NJP can, in some instances, be enough to warrant disenrollment, a PRB must be held before disenrolling the student due to the differences in process, possible outcome, and releasab ility of information. 6-9 Performance Review Board (PRB) The PRB is an administrative tool available to the PNS to investigate, review, and document recommendati ons regarding the best course of action to be taken to ensure successful fulfillment of program requirements by students enrolled in any NSTC officer development program . Ideally, the unit will identify potential problems that may lead to a PRB and solve most problems through counseling or extra instruction, as appropriate. Appendix F provides guidance on how a PRB shall be conducted . Appendix P provides guidance on the administrative processing for a PRB. The PRB is not a judicial proceeding but rather an informal administrative hearing most similar to a college or university academic review board . As such, the student is not entitled to be represented by an attorn ey at the hearing (s ee Section 6-11). The PRB will be conducted with formality and decorum, although testimony under oath is not necessary, it is permissible . The student has the right to appear before the board, to submit a written statement, and to present documents or witnesses on the student's behalf . The student will be counseled by the class advisor and shall be given the opportunity to review all evidence to be presented to the board prior to convening. PRB Required . The PRB process protects certain rights of midshipmen; therefore, a PRB shall be convened: a. When a student, who is being placed on probation with out a PRB , requests a PRB in writing within seven days of being notified of the probation; b. When administrative action ma y result in a leave of absence; c. For performance that may result in disenrollment or active service obligation by any midshipman who has signed a DD FORM 4 (Enlistment contract) and service agreement (NSTC 1533/127 or NSTC 1533/135) ; d. When an Executive Board (EB) , Academic Review Board, Honor Board, or Superintendent's Review has been conducted at the USMMA and the OIC does not concur with the findings of the board; e. When a student tests positive for drugs and the CO has determined that the student abused drugs, as define d in OPNAV INST 5340.4 (series ). Drug abusers who are recommended for disenrollment s hall not be recommended for AES; f. When a STA -21 OC receives a grade or cumulative GPA less than program requirements as defined in the applicable OPNAV N13 Program Authorization . As these are active duty students, the OC's presence at the PRB is mandatory ; g. When a MECEP fails to meet established standards as directed by MCRC . As these are active duty students, the OC's presence at the PRB is mandatory ; and NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-11 h. For STA -21(N) Option o nly, a PRB may be used at the discretion of the PNS to motivate academic or aptitude performance . PRB results shall be reported in accordance with Section 4-23. The PRB should be completed in time to ensure it is an effective tool for shaping the next semester's performance . As these are active duty students, the OC's presence at the PRB is mandatory. A PRB is required in the following cases: (1) Term GPA < 2.75; (2) Two co nsecutive terms of a GPA < 3.00; (3) Cumulative GPA < 3.0; and (4) Receipt o f a failing grade in any course. (5) When directed by N9 or NSTC SJA. PRB Waive rs. Midshipmen being considered for disenrollment may waive the right to a PRB in certain types of disenrollments. In those specific disenrollment c ases that allow midshipmen to wai ve their PRB, an acknowledgement using Example 6 -F must be signed and dated by the student who elects to waive the PRB. The PNS may still hold the PRB if deemed necessary. Active duty students, such as STA -21 OCs and MECEP Marine s, may not waive a PRB and t heir presence at the PRB is mandatory. The types of disenrollments midshipmen may waive are outlined below: a. DOR . Midshipmen who received educational assistance and/or subsistence from the Navy and who request to drop from their program may waive their PRB , except in the case of midshipmen who are within a year of commissioning and who are eligible for consideration for ASN Directed AES under current SECNAV guidance . Midshipmen who have received notification o f a PRB for any reason other than a DOR may not submit a subsequent request to drop nor a DOR PRB waiver ; b. Medical Disqualification . Midshipmen found Not Physically Qualified ( NPQ ) by BUMED may waive their PRB. However, a PRB shall be held, wit h or without the student's presence, if there is evidence that the student intentionally concealed a known c ondition during the student's Do DMERB physical or annual certification . Concealment of disqualifying medical information warrants a PRB to consider recoupment. Additionally, if there is evidence that a midshipma n became NPQ through the midshipman's negligence also warrant s a PRB to consider recoupment; c. Dropped by Institution . Midshipmen dropped by their institution (e.g., the student is denied continuation due to financial reasons, the institution denied them opportunity to continue in the school of nursing) may waive their PRB, unless disenrollment for disciplinary or acade mic reasons is more appropriate; and d. Corps of Cadets Membership (subset of Special Reasons) . Midshipme n who are no longer in the Corps of Cadets at a unit where the host institution requires Corps of Cadet membership in order to participate in ROTC may waive their PRB . This exception does not apply if ano ther disenrollment type, such as disciplinary or aptitude, is appropriate. PRB Not Required . A PRB need not be convened under these circumstances: a. Drop on Request by any College Program Basic student who has signed neither a DD Form 4 nor a scholarship agreement (NSTC 1533/127 or NSTC 1533/135). Full disenrollment packages are not necessary in this case. Refer to Appendix P for specific disenrollment requirements. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-12 b. A PRB is not required when one of the following Academy Boards has been conducted at the USMMA and the OIC concurs with the findings of the board: Executive Board, Academic Review Board, Honor Board, or Superintendent's Review. MECEPs and Marine Option midshipmen who are the subject of a PRB f or misconduct or other incident that calls the individual's morals into questions and results in the PNS not recommending disenrollment, must have their packages forwarded to MCRC ON/E via Senior Marine, NETC for review and a moral waiver decision . Senior Marine, NETC will make a recommendation to MCRC. Terms and conditions guidance for ending LOAs are in Section 4 -28.6. 6-10 Convening a PRB The PNS will normally be the appointing authority for the PRB, unless otherwise directed by higher authority . The PRB shall consist of at least three voting members (an uneven number composed of at least two officers and, potentially, a representative of the academic institution) and one non -voting member (officer or senior enlisted) to serve as the recorder . The PNS may also appoint one ot her non - voting board member, (e.g., the student's company or battalion commander) to advise the senior board member on the student concerned . The PRB shall be appointed via PRB Convening Order (Example 6 - E), and will include all participating members (voting, non -voting and observers) and all reasons for the student's PRB, (i.e., one of the 12 reasons for potential disenrollment (Section 6 -16)). The senior member of the PRB is a voting member and normally will be the unit XO or another O-4. An O -3 may chair a PRB for a minor offense (see 3 -19) or for a performance -related issue such as failing to meet academic, aptitude, or physical fitness standards. An O -4 must chair any PRB for a major offense (see 3 -19) and for any PRB held subsequent to an O -3 chai red-PRB for a performance -related issue. The PNS may not be a member of the PRB . Voting board members may include any active or reserve commissioned officer or an offici al from the academic institution concerned . If the host institution declines to appoint a member representing the academic institution, or if the person appointed does not attend, the PNS will appoint another member. To avoid conflicts of interest, only persons who have no involvement with the matters before the board may be appointed as voting members . If the XO or any other voting board member has a conflict of interest, as determined by the PNS, the PNS must appoint a new voting board member . The cla ss advisor of the student concerned shall not serve as a voting board member. The PRB outcome is determined by majority vote . The senior board member's vote carries the same weight as other voting members. The recorder is a non -voting member, normally t he student's class advisor and is typically the most familiar with the student's performance and conduct . The recorder is responsible for preparing and presenting the case on behalf of the command . At the discretion of the PNS, an additiona l member from either the active duty or civilian staff may be assigned to assist the recorder in note -taking duties and serve as the recorder's assistant . Normally, the student's company or battalion commander will be asked to provide testimony regarding the student co ncerned . Although there is no limit to the number of people attending or speaking at a PRB, only the voting members may be present during final deliberations. The recorder is responsible for assembling pertinent directives, interviewing prospective witnesses, gathering all available evidence, and conducting a preliminary inquiry in cases involving disciplinary matters. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-13 a. No later than five full business days (not counting the day of notification nor the day of the PRB) before the PRB is sched uled to convene, the recorder shall: (1) Provide the student with written notice of the date the PRB will convene and general reasons for the PRB; (2) Provide the student with any and all documents that may be presented in the case against the student, including but not limited to the PRB Convening Order , counseling sheets, witness statements, and a complete copy of the preliminary inquiry (if any); (3) Provide the student with a list of all witnesses expected to be called in the Recorder's case; (4) Have the student s ign AND DATE the convening order and acknowledge receipt of all material provided; and (5) Obtain a signed Privacy Act Statement from the student (included in the convening order) . b. The recorder must keep an accurate record of the proceedings and pr epare the record for the senior board member's review and signatures of all board members . This summary shall include the testimony of the student, all board members, and any witnesses . A recorded or verbatim transcript is not required but is highly advi sed in more contentious cases . Audio recordings of the proceedings may be used for purposes of preparing an accurate summary . Any recordings shall be retained until disposition decision is made by final authority . In the event the proceedings are not recorded, the recorder should take sufficient notes in order to prepare summaries. c. Ensure that a copy of the record of proceedings is delivered to the student no later than five full business days after the PRB (See 6-13). 6-11 The Respondent's Rights b efore the PRB Students shall be advised of the following rights before their PRB : a. To appear before the board at their expense . Non-active duty student's presence is recommended but is not mandatory . If the student does not intend to appear, the student shall submit written notification to the PNS within the five business day notification period . In these cases, the PRB will be h eld in absentia . Likewise, if the student is in civilian or military custody or unable to appear based on circumstances outside of the control of the command, the PRB may also proceed in absentia. Active -duty student's presence is required. b. To submit a written statement to the board. c. To present documents or witnesses on their behalf (at own expense). d. To review their personnel record and all documents submitted for board consideration prior to the convening of the board. The student shall be advised of the possible outcomes the board may recommend to the PNS and that ASN Directed AES or recoupment could apply in case of disenrollment. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-14 The student shall be notified, in writing, at least five full business days prior to the convening of a PRB . The day of notification and the day the PRB is being conducted do not count towards the five full business day notification period. Notification should be delivered in person, normally by the class advisor or another staff officer, or if the student is not in the imm ediate area, by certified mail with return receipt requested . A copy of the convening order , along with a signed and dated proof of delivery, shall be included in the board report . The convening order shall advise the stu dent, in general terms, of the reason(s) for the PRB. The student may waive the five business day notification period via the convening order . If the student waives the five business day notification, the PNS can reschedule the PRB to an earlier date, or if requested by the student, a reasonable delay in convening the proceedings may be granted and should be documented via PRB Date Change Letter ( Example 8 -H) and include d in the PRB file. If due to an administrative error the PRB is held within less than five full business days and the student did not waive the five business day notification period and the PRB resulted in the PNS recommending disenrollment, CNSTC shall m ake a determination as to whether the error has harmed the student's case or not. CNSTC may direct a new PRB or determine that no harm to the student resulted as a result of this administrative error. Students subject to PRB may retain counsel at their own expense . Students who wish to have their counsel present at PRB proceedings must notify the PNS in writing no later than 48 hours before the board . Generally, counsel is free to make opening and closing statements on the stude nt's behalf, as may any witness . During these statements, counsel may testify/recount the counsel's understanding of the events that occurred . Counsel may also explain why these events do not warrant any , or lesser , administrative action on the part of the Navy . However, coun sel may not actively participate in the board's proceedings (e.g., call witnesses, ask questions of witnesses). The student may request to have observers attend the board . This request must be made in writing to the PNS no later tha n 48 hours before the board. 6-12 PRB Procedures The senior board member will call the board to order and explain the basis for holding the board (e.g., academic, aptitude), presenting only the facts before the board . The student will again be advised of the possible outcomes of the board, including ASN Directed AES or recoupment if disenrollment is recommended and approved. The recorder will present the relevant facts, to include any witness testimony or documentary evidence . Unless unavoidable (e.g., the PNS is the only eyewit ness to an incident), the PNS shall not testify as a witness to preclude the appearance of undue command influence . When it appears the PNS may have to testify, guidance shall be obtained from the NSTC SJA . Unless specifically authorized by the student, medical documents shall not be acquired for or presented to the PRB . BUMED notification of a student's disqualification suffices to determine that the student is not physically qualified. However, if a student is suspected of concealing a disqualifying m edical condition, either during the DoDMERB evaluation or during annual physical certifications, the board may request medical documents to determine if recoupment is warranted. The student, and/or the student's counsel, will be afforded the opportunity t o make a statement on the student's behalf . At the senior member's discretion, any board member may ask the student or counsel to clarify any testimony or statements brought before the board. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-15 The student or student's counsel may object to specific board actions or proceedings, but must provide a statement as to why it is objectionable . Any objections will be considered and ruled on by the senior member . If, in the senior member's judgment, the conduct of any person interferes with the orderly conduct of the board, the hearing will be adjourned until order is restored . The rulings of the senior member are final with respect to the proceedings but are subject to review by higher authority . All objections and rulings must be included in the PRB report. The board is limited to considering only those performance shortcomings listed as the reason (s) for the PRB specified in the student notification letter . This limitation does not prevent the board from hearing of previous shortcomings or administrative act ions. If the board discovers a different grounds for administrative action and desires to pursu e this additional reason for administrative action , the board shall halt proceedings to begin the PRB process over, including a new PRB Convening Order that inc ludes any additional reason(s) for a PRB. After all evidence has been presented and all statements have been submitted, all persons, except the voting board members, will leave the board room . Only the voting board members may deliberate and, to prevent the appearance of undue command influence, vote shall be by secret ballot . A simple majority will determine the outcome . Upon reaching a decision, the senior member will reconvene the board (to include the student and any witnesses desire d by the student ) and announce the board's findings of fact and recommendations . The PRB may make the following recommendations: no action, issuance of a 30 - day compliance letter to investigate medical concerns, warning, probation, LOA, or disenrollment . If the board r ecommends disenrollment, they shall also make a recommendation regarding ASN Directed AES or recoupment, if applicable. 6-13 The PRB Report The PRB report (Example 6 -I) shall be prepared by the recorder, reviewed by the Senior Member of the board, signed by all voting board members and recorder , and forwarded to the PNS via the midshipman for which the PRB was conducted . When a board member is not from the local area, an electronic signature obtained via email or fax will suffice . Any board member may submit a dissenting opinion and append it to the report . The PRB r eport shall include the convening order , the preliminary investigation (if applicable), all documents con sidered by the board, a summarized testimony of each witness, the board's finding of fact , board recommendations , and tallies of board votes (i.e., 3 -0, 2-1). If any vote is not unanimous, include the specific dissenting vote content (name not desired ) in the report. The PRB report will be given to the student . An electronic copy may be sent if positive receipt is documented . If the PRB was held in absentia or the student is no longer in contact with the unit, a copy of the PRB r eport shall be sent to the student by certified mail with return receipt requested . The student shall acknowledge receipt of the PRB report and be afforded an opportunity to agree/dispute the proceedings and five full business days to provide a written response to the PNS. PNS Endorsement . Once the student has had an opportunity to respond to the PRB r eport , the PNS will consider the package in its totality and endorse the board report, either concurring or non -concurring with the findings and recommendations of the board ( Example 6-J). In cases where the PNS is a witness and has testified before the PRB, the PNS may not endorse the PRB report and shall seek guidance from the NSTC SJA . In the endorsement, the PNS should not comment on matters not discussed before the PRB, either by the board members or the student, but instead limit comments only to those matters presented to the board. The student shall be given a copy of the PNS's endorsement , and the student will be given up to five full business days to respond to the recommendations in the PNS's endorsement . If the PRB was held in NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-16 absentia or the student is no longer in contact with the unit, a copy of the PNS's endorsement shall be sent to the student by certified mail, return receipt requested. A copy of the PRB report , including the student's responses and the PNS endorsement, shall be maintained in the Student File. In cases involving STA -21(N) OC s, a copy of the PRB r eport , including PNS cover letter and student responses, shall be forwarded to OPNAV N133 via NSTC N91. This report is the only instance when the PRB report must be forwarded to NSTC N93 absent of a recommendation for disenrollment . However, should the a pplicant be processed for disenrollment, the entire disenrollment report must be forwarded to NSTC N93 after disenrollment approval has been granted by N133 via NSTC N91. For Marine Option students, forward a copy of the PNS endorsement and the PRB report to MCRC ON/E. 6-14 Disenrollment Recommendations Ultimate disenrollment authority for obligated Navy or Marine Option midshipmen is with SECNAV (currently delegated to Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) ( ASN (M&RA) ), for obligated SSM with CNSTC, midshipmen with Director, Officer Development (Note: non -obligated SSMP may be disenrolled by the unit PNS/OIC) , for STA -21 OCs with CNSTC , and for MECEP Marine s with MCRC . The PNS has some latitude in d etermining whether circumstances warrant the recommendation of disenrollment of a student . However, a recommendation for disenrollment should be considered as the primary course of action following a PRB for the following: a. Academic deficiencies (Section 3-18) that result in a cumulative GPA of less than a 2.5 at any point after completing three semesters (or four quarte rs) of college, regardless of time in the NROTC program . b. Any Major offenses (Section 3-19). c. Substandard aptitude following remediation or an unwillingness to make necessary behavioral changes. d. Two official PFA/PFT/CFT failures within three years , especially when it appears the individual is not exerting proper effort to achieve and maintain these standards. The PNS endorsement shall contain a recommendation for repayment: AES or recoupment . All recommendations marked \"Definitely not recommended\" for future military service must include justification. If, during the PRB or in the disenrollment paperwork, a statement is made that the student has a medical, physical, psychological, alcohol , or drug problem that may preclude them from AES, a 30-day compliance letter and medical evaluation shall be complete d and forwarded to BUMED before mailing the disenrollment package to NSTC N93. If the student tests positive during a n official urinalysis test, a medical evaluation is not required. The PNS shall personally sign all disenrollment reports and make the appropriate recommendations . If the PNS is unavailable, the XO may sign the disenrollment report as \"Acting.\" However, the XO may not endorse the disenrollment report if the XO served as the senior member for that board . The student is also required to s ign the disenrollment report . In doing so, the student may address any matters pertaining to the disenrollment recommendation . In effect, the student is allowed to make two statements: one NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-17 immediately following the PRB, and a second prior to completion of the disenrollment report . There is no separate appeal process of a disenrollment recommendation as every disenrollment package, including student statements, is reviewed by each signature authority as the disenrollment package progresses ( N04, CNSTC, M CRC, PNS recommends disenrollment following a PRB and the midshipman is not already on Inter im LOA or LOA, the midshipman sha ll be immediately placed G-code (\"pending disenrollment\") LOA pending final disenrollment determination . All entitlements will be stopped . Should the recommendation for disenrollment be overturned in the chain of command above the PNS, all entitlements, less stipend, will be restored effective the date LOA began . Stipend monies will be restored effective the date the disenrollment recommendation is overturned. The timeliness of disenrollment recommendations is critical to ensure program efficiency and proper use of Navy and Marine Corps manpower. a. The PNS shall sign and forward the properly completed midshipmen disenrollment recommendation to N93 within 30 days of the date of the PRB or the date that the student waived the right to a PRB . Packages delayed at the unit beyond 30 days shall cont ain a written explanation of the delay signed by the PNS . This policy includes packages that are forwarded by the unit to NSTC N93 that are deficient; deficient packages must be corrected by the unit within 30 days of the PRB . Deficient packages not corr ected within 30 days of the PRB shall require a written explanation from the PNS of the deficiency and delay from the unit. b. The OIC at the USMMA shall inform the office of the USMMA Superintendent regarding all recommendations for midshipman dise nrollment . If the USMMA Superintendent's office desires to add information to the disenrollment package , that information will be included in the OIC's disenrollment submission to NSTC N93. Due to this additional administrative requirement, disenrollment packages from the USMMA shall be forwarded to NSTC N93 within 45 days of the PRB or an explanation of the delay must be forwarded with the package by the OIC. c. NSTC N9 shall sign all complete disenrollment packages for non -obligated midshipmen wi thin 30 days of receipt from the units . NSTC N9 shall process and forward all other complete disenrollment packages to CNSTC within 30 days of receipt from the units . Deficient disenrollment packages received at N93 shall be processed and forwarded withi n 30 days of receiving all correcte d documents . Packages delayed at N9 beyond this 30 -day requirement shall have a written explanation of the delay, signed by the N9 that will be forwarded with the package. d. NSTC N93 will ensure a system to track disenrollment actions pending at NROTC units and N9 is in place and available for CNSTC review . NSTC N9 will use DON Tracker to submit packages to CNSTC to provide greater visibility of packages moving to completion. e. CNSTC will be equally timely in its processing of disenrollments . All packages shall be processed and forwarded as appropriate within 30 days of receipt from NSTC N9. f. Active duty disenrollments (STA -21, MECEP) will be expedited at each level in order to efficiently return manpower to the fleet. The processing of active duty disenrollments shall take priority over midshipmen disenrollments. STA -21(N) only . If the PNS considers the OC unsuitable for enlisted duty in the NNPP , then Navy Enlist ed Classification Code (NEC) removal action per OPNAVINST 1220.1 (series ) shall be initiated as part of the disenrollment recommendation . Nuclear NEC rem oval will not be considered a substitute for NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-18 appropriate disciplinary action . Recommendations for non -return to nuclear enlisted service shall include sufficient information and justification concerning the recommendation (e.g., counseling records, NJP documentation) . Lack of motivation is not sufficient reason for non -return to nuclear enlisted service. The PNS may authorize s tudents disenrolled for other than disciplinary reasons or aptitude before the end of an academic term to complete the current te rm as Naval Science students. Any student who is disenrolled must return all government propert y (uniforms, Naval Science textbooks, etc.) before leaving the unit . As midshipmen are members of the I nactive Ready until ASN (M&RA) approves disenrol lment, midshipmen pending disenrollment shall not have their military identification /common access cards confiscated until final disenrollment approval is given . The student shall be held accountable for damaged, missing, or lost items and must reimburse the government for any items returned damaged or not returned . When a student has left the unit without turning in government property, the PNS will request via certified mail, the return of all government property . In addition, students who have had access to classified material shall be debriefed and shall execute a Security Termination Statement OPNAV 5511/14 , in accordance with SECNAVINST 5510.30 (series ). The original will be filed in the student file and a copy ma intained at the unit for a period of two years. 6-15 Recoupment, AES , and Obligation Waiver NROTC midshipmen who have a military obligation per their service agreement (e.g. , have passed their obligation date, were released from active duty to accept a scholarship) , but who attrite from the program before commissioning are subject to recoupment and/or ASN Directed AES per the terms of their service agreement . a. Scholar ship students who incur obligation remain obligated even if they transfer to the College Program. b. Students awarded NROTC scholarships from active duty will be processed for recoupment and may be ordered back to active duty to complete the obligat ion remaining on their most recent enlistment contract. These students will be referred to the appropriate Service Agency (USN or USMC) for re - accession into the enlisted ranks. SSM disenrolled at any time may be subject to recoupment or ASN Directed AES. The authority to pursue recoupment rests with the MARAD. The authority to pursue ASN Directed AES rests with the U.S. Navy. Review Appendix R for more information. All obligated students being processed for disenroll ment shall be afforded the option to request recoupment or AES using th e Disenrollment Acknowledgement Form NSTC 1533/120 . The NSTC for all scholarsh ip midshipmen being disenrolled, regardless of obligation status. a. Requests for AES must explain the reason(s) for the request for service. b. If the student refuses to sign the Disenrollment Acknowledgement Form, the PNS shall make a statement to that effect on the form . In exceptional cases, the student may request a waiver of all obligations for medical or other extraordinary circumstances. Students shall provide a written statement regarding their request for obligation waiver. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-19 The PNS shall provide an endorsement to N93 on the student's NSTC 1533/12 2, PNS Summary Letter, or waiver request and must recommend recoupment, ASN Directed AES, or a waiver of obligation. The PNS should base the decision on the following guidance: a. Per NSTCINST 1533.12 , ASN Directed AES must be considered for midshipmen who drop -on- request within 12 months of expected graduation date. b. AES may be recommended if the student has indicated the desire for AES and the PNS judges this to be in the interest of the Armed Forces. AES should not be recommended if the PNS feels that the student is unsuitable due to disciplinary issues, drug abuse, family hardship, etc. c. The PNS will normally recommend recoupment in all other cases where the midshipman fails to meet the requirements set forth in their Service Agreement. d. The PNS will consider requests to w aive all obligation s on a case-by-case basis and generally only recommend such waivers when significant extenuating circumstance beyond the student's control lead to the disenrollment . 6-16 Types of Disenrollments The following sections cla ssify the 1 2 types of disenrollments and address the unique requirements of each: Academic a. Students who remain on academic probation or on LOA for more than one term (quarter or semester) must be considered for academic disenrollment. b. The PNS shal l recommend the disenrollment of any NROTC student whose general academic record and/or specific academic failures make their value as an officer doubtful. c. When recommending a student for an academic disenrollment, a statement concerning any probationary or LOA letters previously issued by the PNS is required . The statement need not be submitted as a separate letter, but may be included within the statement of circumstances recorded on the NSTC 1533/ 122 form in the space designated for PNS's comm ents or the PNS Summary Letter . The statement need only d eclare that the student was issued previous letters of academic probation and list the dates of such letters . For example: \"MIDN [Name] has been placed on academic probation on two different occasi ons by correspondence da ted 21 January and 15 April 2017 .\" d. The PNS shall include a recommendation regarding AES or recoupment, if the student is obligated. Inaptitude . The PNS shall recommend disenrollment of any NROTC student who has demonstrated a lack of officer aptitude (Section 3 -19) as to make further retention unjustified . Disciplinary a. Disciplinary disenrollment recommendations should be made for students who have committed a major offense (see 3 -19) or a similar offense, unless the PNS believes that remediation is possible before the stud ent's anticipated commissioning date. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-20 b. The academic institution may take independen t disciplinary action . The PNS will advise NSTC N9 of any disciplinary action taken by the institution. Physical Readiness . Inability to meet physical conditioning standards or swimming qualification requirements (Section 3 -20). Note: N93 requires PRB packages where two PFA/PFT/CFT failures have occurred (even if the PRB finding is favorable). The PNS may make a retention request as part of the disenrollment package. PNSs will submit the PRB according to the above timelines. DOR a. Requests to drop from an officer commissioning program should be in writing, dated, and signed by the student . If submitted electronically (via email), every attempt should be made to obtain a handwritten signature on a printout of the statement, with a d ate if not included in the original printout. If the student submits the request to drop prior to being issued a PRB Convening Order , the disenrollment will be processed as a drop on request. If a PRB is appointed for any reason other than a request to d rop prior to when the request to drop is submitted, the PRB will be conducted for the reason provided in the PRB Convening Order , or a new PRB will be convened to address the original reason and the DOR . As with any PRB, midshipmen who request to drop may chose not to be present at the PRB (active duty members are required to attend their PRBs) . The final attrition code in OPMIS will be entered by N93 when final approval for disenrollment has been received. b. Any student may disenroll at their own request if appointed to another service academy or ROTC program . Additional guidance concerning inter -service transfer requests is contained in Chapter 4. c. Voluntary disenrollment requests for STA -21(N) OCs should be given careful consideration and forwarded with appropriate comments and recommendations . The PNS must make a statement concerning th e OC's suitability for return to nuclear enlisted duty. d. The PNS shall include a recommendation regarding ASN Directed AES for all Navy option scholarship midshipmen who submit a drop on request within 12 months of graduation IAW NSTCINST 1533.12. Special Reasons (Hardship, Conscientious Objector, Refusal of Immunization, and Corps of Cadets Membership). a. NROTC students may apply, via the chain of command, for disenrollment for special reasons due to hardship , family illnesses, or conscientious objector status , as described below . Such requests shall be endorsed only after conducting an inquiry and a PRB. (1) Severe financial hardship as set forth in MILPERSMAN 1910 -110. (2) Family illness es that require student withdrawal from school. (3) A conscientious objector as defined in MILPERSMAN 1900 -020. (a) Student s' statements that they are conscientious objectors do not automa tically constitute grounds for disenrollment . Students bear the burden of proving their claims as grounds for disenrollment or assignment to noncombatant training and service . Students also have the burden of determining and setting forth the exact natur e of their request ( e.g., whether for separation or for assignment to noncombatant training). NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-21 (b) An O -4 or above should be appointed by the PNS as investigating officer to conduct an inquiry to determine the student's motive . If the investigating officer determines that the student made the statement for the purpose of seeking separation, the unit may process the disenrollment on the basis of DOR, or if other concerns are brought to light, the unit may process the disenrollment on the basis of inaptitude . In either case, recoupment or AES may be recommended. (c) For further guidance, consult MILPERSMAN 1900 -020 and the NSTC SJA before taking action regarding an alleged conscientious objector. b. Refusal of Immunization . See Chapter 9 regarding immunization requirem ents. Consult the NSTC SJA regarding students who refuse any required immunization. c. Corps of Cadets Membership . At some host institutions, it is a school requirement that a student be a member of the Corps of Cadets in order to participate in R OTC . At such schools, any midshipman who resigns, is expelled, or is suspended from the Corps of Cadets shall normally be disenrolled . The PNS may recommend to CNSTC that a midshipman's scholarship be transferred to another host institution. Medical disqualification a. The PNS will request a review of pertinent medical information, records, and/or examinations by BUMED when it is suspected that physically disqualifying problems exist for an NROTC student . The PNS shall include any existing me dical documentation on behalf of the midshipman . Moreover, it is equally important that the PNS provide BUMED and NSTC N9 a \"non -medical assessment of the student\" concerned. b. Upon written notification and determination by BUMED that a student is NPQ for continued service, the Deputy Commander for NROTC Operations, N04 , as delegated by CNSTC, recommendation If N04 non-concurs with the BUMED recommendation, the BUMED letter will be forwarded to CNSTC for a waiver de termination . If N04 or CNSTC disapproves the waiver, the PNS shall process the disenrollment due to physical disqualification. c. If an active duty student (MECEP/STA -21) is found NPQ for the program by BUMED , and BUMED, MCRC, N9, or the PNS believes that the member may be medically disqualified for continued military service, the member will be referred to the nearest Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) . The MTF will make a determination if a Medical Evaluation Board (M ed Board) would be approp riate. Should the MTF determine that a Med Board is required , efforts should be made to transfer the student to the nearest military location capable of receiving members placed on medical hold . These actions will be conducted parallel to the disenrollme nt process . The member should not be made available for orders back to the fleet until the MTF review has been completed. d. A student processed for disenrollment due solely to alcohol abuse/dependency may be processed as a medical disenrollment if BUMED has confirmed that the problem is disqualifying and does not recommend a waiver . However, if misconduct is involved or an administrative action is pending, the alcohol problem and misconduct may be treated separately . In doing so, process the dise nrollment for either disciplinary or inaptitude reasons , as appropriate . Likewise, an inability to meet physical readiness standards shall be characterized as such, unless occasioned by a medical problem . If medical reasons are not the only basis for dis enrollment, the PNS may use the other reason to determine the type of disenrollment recommend ed. Death . When processing a disenrollment due to death, the following shall be addressed and forwarded to NSTC N93: NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-22 a. NROTC Student File (to include Health records); and b. Statement from the PNS concerning the death (time, date, location , and circumstances, if known). Dropped by the Institution . Any NROTC student dropped (or involuntarily disenrolled) by the academic institution for any reaso n shall be immediately be processed for disenrollment , including students who are \"susp ended,\" \"forced to withdraw,\" \"n ot permitted to register for the next semester,\" or for any other si milar reason prevented by the institution from con tinuing their enrollment (t emporarily or permanently ). Failure to Enroll a. The PNS shall process for disenrollment any NROTC student who has failed to enroll in the required Naval Science C ourse. b. Any student who, although eligible to continue enrollment at the institution, discontinues their enrollment, shall be processed for disenrollment by the PNS . MCRC Directed a. Moral Waiver Denials . MCRC may direct the disenrollment of a MECEP or Marine Option midshipman following the review of a moral waiver request . As a PRB was previously cond ucted for the moral waiver, no further PRB is required for the MCRC directed disenrollment . The unit shall forward all other required documentation for the disenrollment to N93 for normal disenrollment processing. b. OCS Failure . MCRC may direct disenrollment processing based on performance at OCS . The PRB shall consider the midshipman's performance at the unit in its entirety and should consider and make a recommendation regarding change of option to the Navy . Not Selected for Advanced Standing . This characterization is given to disenrollments of College Program Basic students who are not sel ected for Advanced Standing or s chola rship prior the start of their junior year. 6-17 Disenrollment Packages Scholarship Program Midshipman or College Program Advanced Standing a.

When doing so, the individual should provide NSTC N93 a copy of the enlistment contract with a cover letter requesting deferment of the debt . NSTC N93 will then forward NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 6-28 the request to DFAS -IN. On receipt, DFAS -IN should suspend the debt while the service member is in an active duty status . Once the service member co mpletes two years of AES , the service member shall provide a statement of service from their command as proof of two years of service . NSTC N93 will then send a letter to DFAS -IN requesting that the debt be terminated. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 7-1 CHAPTER 7 Pay, Allowances and 7-1 General Benefits ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................ 7-1 ents Disability or Death ................................ ................... Benefits Financial benefits are authorized for courses which are required to receive an undergraduate degree in the major field of study set forth in the NROTC Service contract a nd for Naval Science C ourses . Benefits are not authorized for courses which are not required by the degree or the NROTC Program. Students on LOA are not authorized financial benefits or subsistence payments. Entitlement to benefits for Scholarship Program students is authorized by Title 10, USC, for the length of the scholarship award and is subject to the following limitations: a. In accordance with Section 209, Title 37, USC, s ubsistence benefits shall not exceed 20 months during the basic course (f irst two years of Naval Science) and 20 months during the advanced course (last two years of Naval Science) for a total period not exceeding 40 months . In addition, entitlements cannot exceed a maximum o f ten months per year; b. For a student transferring f rom the College Program to the Scholarship Program, the length of the scholarship award is predicated upon the student's degree plan . Students will receive scholarship benefits only for the time remaining until their class would graduate . If additional b enefits are necessary, midshipmen may, in some cases, be granted extended entitlement s as discussed in Section 4-32; and c. Entitlements during the advanced course may be extended if authorized per the provisions of extended entitlement s as discussed in Section 4-32. However, entitlement to such benefits shall not exceed a total of 30 months, in accordance with Section 209, Title 37, USC. Students must be full time students and meet all curriculum and Naval Science requirements to be eligible to receive benefits . The PNS may waive participation in some requirements for short periods of time based on degree plan requirements and short -term medical limitations . Naval Science students (those university students not affiliated with the NROTC Program) are no t entitled to any benefits, but may use Naval Science textbooks if sufficient inventory exists . Financial benefits are not authorized for retaking courses for which payment was made in previous terms (e.g., second tries at courses previously failed, re -enrollment in courses dropped after the Navy was financially obligated to pay tuition, etc.). NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 7-2 7-2 Scholarship Tuition, Fees, and Related Expenses Payment for educational expenses (tuition, book stipends, and approved fees) are subject to limitations for the basic and advanced courses and the length of the scholarship award as set forth in Section 7-1. a. Tuition . Payments are not authorized for special interest elective courses requiring additional fees (e.g., physical education courses for mountain climbing, skiing, horseback riding, etc.) or c ourses in elective options for academic majors that require addition al fees (e.g ., flying instruction). b. NROTC will pay for tuition and fees, excluding travel costs, for a course taken away from the campus where the student is enrolled, provided that: (1) The course is included in the student's approved degree plan and has been approved by the PNS and the institution in advance; and (2) Tuition for the course will not exceed that which would be paid for a course taken at the campus where the student is enrolled. Fees. Fees for advanced placement examinations will be reimbursed only if the examination results in credit for courses which are included in the student's degree program or will advance the student's commissioning date . NROTC will pay fees (such as hea lth, student activity, athlet ic, library, student union, or transcript fees) imposed on all ful l-time undergraduate students, and which are not optional (i.e . cannot be rejected by the student) . The PNS will ensure that only fees compensable under this se ction are paid with NROTC fun ds. Personal Student Equipment . Purchase of any equipment intended for perso nal use (e.g., laptops, calculators, drafting tools ) cannot be paid by NROTC even if such purchase is required by the educational institution. GI Bi ll. GI Bill benefits are available to students with prior enlisted service who are eligible for such benefits . The VA's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) has determined that use of both STA -21 Program funds and GI Bill benefits may be used simultaneous ly so long as payment is for different courses and not combined to pay for the same course . The VA determined that while 38 U.S.C \u00a7 3681(a)(1) bars concurrent use of funds from both the GI Bill and DoD programs like STA -21 to pay for the same course, it d oes not bar concurrent payment from both sources for different courses that are part of a program of education. a. The Navy's STA -21 Program pays selected enlisted service members up to $10,000 annually to attend college full time and earn a degree, on the condition that they will then serve the Navy for an agreed upon period of time . This Navy scholarship is not always sufficient to pay for all courses needed to fulfill degree requirements . The service member can use GI Bill benefits from the VA (Chapter 30 of Title 38) to pay for courses after the service member's STA -21 funds are exhausted. b. Because MECEP and College Program students do not receive tuition allocation, they are already authorized to use the GI Bill for tuition payments. c. Scholarship stude nts are not authorized to use GI Bill benefits for tuition payment. d. Questions concerning this or any other matter regarding the coordination of benefits executed under NSTC N9 and the VA should be directed to NSTC N93.

NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 7-8 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-1 CHAPTER 8 Supply Supply Management ................................ ................................ ................................ .... 8-1 8-2 STA -21 Books, and Fees ................................ .................... 8-13 8-8 Small Arms, Meals Ready to Tailored Operational Training Meals (TOTM) .................... ................................ ........................ 8-21 8-14 Government Agency (DLA) Disposition Services ................ 8-29 Supply Management Introduction a. NROTC units are fourth echelon shore activities that report directly to CNSTC. NROTC units are provided administrative and logistics support and guid ance necessary to effectively operate as a shore activity and to achieve the objectives of the NROTC Program. The majority of guidance regarding supply management is provided by NSTC N4 with the majority of financial guidance provided by NSTC N8. Guidanc e is supplemented by a variety of publicatio ns from the SECNAV, OPNAV, Comptroller of the Navy, NETC, Fleet Logistics Center (FLC), and Naval Facilities Engineering Command. b. The NROTC unit supply technician is an essenti al element in the effective and eff icient operation of the unit. Supply technicians are responsible for all aspects of appropriated funds and material management. These functions include maintenance of the NROTC unit's OPTAR records for both O&MN and MPN appropriations, monitoring, and receipt control of unit acquisitions, uniform and textbook issue and control, and other miscellaneous functions. It is critical to the unit's mission success that the majority of the Supply Technician's efforts are applied to these functions inside the NR OTC unit. Organizational Elements NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-2 a. Primary Staff Elements . In the course of all supply operations, guidance and direction shall come directly from NSTC N4. In the course of all financial operations, guidance and direction shall come directly from the NSTC N8. The NSTC Comptroller is the Chief Financial Advisor to the CNSTC and the NROTC COs and has overall responsibility for maintaining the controls on all matters relating to financial management. This communication and interface allows for clarifica tion of areas of current interest before problems develop. b. Organizational Element Roles . The role of each organizational element is as follows: (1) NSTC N9 is the program manager for NROTC. (2) NSTC N4 handles most matters relating to supply policy and admin istration while N9 is responsible for identifying and defining NROTC unit operating requirements. (3) NSTC Comptroller, with offices located in Great Lakes, IL, oversees and is responsible for all budget formulation and execution related to NROTC units. NROTC Unit Resources a. General . As cited above, NROTC units receive funds from two Congressional appropriations: OM&N and MPN. DNS offices located at SSMP units receive OM&N funds only. b. OM&N . The OM&N appropriation provides resources for daily operation and maintenance expenses of the Navy. In support of the NROTC Program, OM&N funds tuition, tutoring, books, fees, communications (e.g., wireless telephones), vehicles, postage, consumable supplies, civilian salaries, printing and reproduction, staff Tempo rary Duty (TDY) travel, midshipmen summer training travel, organizational clothing (e.g., reflective vests), midshipmen initial/discharge travel, rentals, and equipment costing less than the current expense/investment threshold. For DNS, it similarly supp orts consumable supplies, printing and reproduction, etc. For more details on OM&N see the following website: https://www.secnav.navy.mil/fmc/fmb/Documents/19pres/OMN_Vo l1_book.pdf . (1) Fund Administration and Standardized Document Automation (FASTDATA) is a web -based system used to execute and track each unit's OPTAR. FASTDATA user information and instructions on how to use the system is located at https://netfocus.netc.navy.mil/nrotc/login2/nrotc.aspx . (2) All accounting documentation relating to FASTDATA bill payments shall be forwarded to NSTC N8. c. MPN . The MPN appropriation provides for midshipman pay and allowances, monthly stipends, uniforms and alterations, subsistence -in-kind, commutations -in-lieu, Meals Ready to Eat (MRE), and Tailored Operational Training Meals (TOTM) for NROTC midshipmen. d. Non-appropriated Funds - Recreation Funds . Expenditu res from Navy recreation funds must benefit active duty personnel only; this includes STA -21 and MECEP students. NROTC students are prohibited from participating in the use of such funds. The administration of that fund shall be in accordance with BUPERSINST 1710.11 (series). Control over the recreation fund and other special unit funds will not be placed under custody of the unit supply technician. e. Other Navy Resources . Certain materials are provided to support the NROTC Program even though the N ROTC unit is not directly involved in funding for these items. Examples include NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-3 requirements for small arms and ammunition (i.e., Sea Trials staff may request), training aids, IT equipment and unit vehicles. f. Non-governmental (Host Institution) Funds . Ho st colleges or universities may provide funds to respective NROTC units and DNS's because of their departmental status at the institution. Support may be provided in the form of classroom and office space, equipment, utilities, secretarial services, repro duction and office supplies, and other miscellaneous support. Management and accountability of this monetary allowance is a matter between the NROTC unit or DNS and the institution. Other resource support may be provided by alumni or retired veterans' as sociations for special projects, such as equipment for the drill team or drum and bugle corps. Unit Financial Management Controls, NROTC Unit Identification . Within the financial system, the Unit Identification Code (UIC) and a tw o-digit school code identify each NROTC unit. A list of unit UICs, school codes, purchasing office codes, and call/order serial numbers is available at https://netfocus.netc.navy.mil/nr otc/login2/nrotc.aspx . Budget Calls a. OM&N . A budget call is forwarded to the NROTC units and DNS each year by NSTC N9 via Official Mail Message. Each unit shall submit a completed budget req uest and spending plan to NSTC N93 not later than the second Fr iday in March. Past and current year budget data are requested by expense element (See Appendix H) and spending plans by quarters. Justification for the amount requested in each expense ele ment is required. The spending plan will enable NSTC N8 to distr ibute funds in the order of unit execution and NSTC N93 to monitor execution. Special attention shall be given to the fact that funds shall be completely expended each quarter. An approved OM&N OPTAR with annotations on disapprovals is forwarded to the N ROTC units and DNS by 30 August each year. b. MPN OPTAR (Annual Financial Plan, Schedule C) . Each April, a Schedule C report shall be submitted for the coming fiscal year. Directions for completing the form will be issued by NSTC N9 via Official Mail Messa ge. The form will list dollar requirements for clothing by quarter, and the number of students by class. Accurate forecasting based upon past and current year enrollments must be carefully computed to ensure adequate funding for clothing. 8-2 STA -21 Authorized Payments for Tuition, Books, and Fees Funds Allocation . STA -21 students receive up to $10,000 per year for tuition, CLEP courses, books, and fees. Those funds are spread across the fiscal year. Therefore, students attending semester schools receive $4000 for spring and fall and $2000 for summer. Students attending quarter schools receive $2,500 per quarter. Funds not used in a previous term can be rolled over to the next term as long as it is within the same fiscal year. Students are not e ntitled to funds for semesters or quarters in which they do not attend school. The amount available at any point in time is shown on the NCMIS Authorization Form. This is a dynamic amount that is increased each semester/quarter and decreased as it is use d for tuition authorizations and claims for reimbursement. The amount shown is only valid as of the date the form is printed as authorizations or claims may have been submitted since the authorization date shown. Authorized Payments . The Navy authorizes the STA -21 Program payments to cover tuition, books, and fees. Fees are defined as student -associated academic fees and do not include parking fees. Advance deposits, registration, and application fees are allowed for the assigned NROTC unit. Shipping costs for books ordered on -line are authorized. Reimbursement for CLEP courses is authorized if the member completed the CLEP courses while enrolled in STA -21 and the courses shall count toward degree completion.

NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-22 Surveys . A survey is the procedure required when Navy property or Defense Logistics Agency material is lost, damaged, or destroyed, except in incoming shipments. A survey's purpose is to determine who or what is responsible and to affix the actual loss to the U nited States Government. To make a true determination, the facts surrounding the loss or damage must be thoroughly investigated in a timely manner. Use JAG Instruction 5800.7F CHAPTER II , and NAVSUP Publication 485 VOLUME III, Ashore Supply . The following forms are used in connection with survey procedures: a.

The General Services Administration (GSA) has a contract with U.S. Bank to issue commercial purchase cards to a uthorized Government personnel to use in support of official Government purchases. The contract is commonly referred to as the \"Government -wide Commercial Purchase Card (GCPC) Program.\" Delegation of Purchase Card Authority . Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Procurement Performance Management Assessment Program (PPMAP) delegates authority to operate a GCPC program. As such, the PPMAP office inspects each command's GCPC program every 18 months. Internal Operating Procedures (IOPs) . Written IOPs f or each command are required IAW NAVSUPINST 4200.99 (series). NROTC units shall generate th eir own IOPs to implement the Do N GCPC policies, to include items a through i, below. Contact the NSTC Level IV GCPC Agency Program Coordinator, Beth Kleinschmidt, at 847 -688-4509x187 or beth.kleinschmidt@navy.mil for a sample IOP or c ourtesy review of an existing IOP. The following elements are mandatory in the command IOP. a. Nomination, appointment and replacement of program participants; NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-23 b. Requirement processing and purchase authorization (obtaining funding, approvals); c. Record keeping; d. Receipt, inspections, acceptance of supplies, and services purchased; e. Notifying the personal property manager of accoun table property procurements, especially pilferable property; f. Reconciliation and verification of the Cardholders (CH) statement and certification of the bank invoice for payment; g. Restricted purchases; h. Disciplinary/administrativ e actions; i. Closure of accounts upon CH transfer, retirement, or termination of employment and ensuring the activity's checkout process includes a requirement to physically turn -in a departing CH's card before departure; and j. Any other pro cedures applicable to the mission of the activity. Head of Activity (HA) . The CO or OIC at each NROTC unit is designated to serve as the HA and is responsible for support/sponsorship to all participants in the GCPC Program as follows: a. Ensure a ppropriate administrative and disciplinary actions are taken when fraudulent, improper and/or abusive purchase card transactions are found; b. Ensure all program participants HA, Agency Program Coordinator (APC), Authorizing Official (AO) and CH (C Hs)) have received the req uired training per DoD and Do N policy and procedures; c. Ensure refresher training on current Do N policies and procedures and local IOP training is completed every two years; d. Ensure program personnel, APCs, AOs and CHs are properly appointed; e. Ensure the number of AOs and purchase card accounts appointed within a command is the minimum number necessary to meet mission requirements and within current span of control guidance; and f. Ensure the roles and responsibilities of the individuals within their programs are not in conflict and adequate checks and balances are in place to manage local programs. Separation of Function . Controls shall be established to ensure a three -way, or at least a two -way separation of function, is occurring for each transaction made by the CH. The same individual shall not initiate the requirement, place the order, and receive the supplies or service. Separation of Duties. a. APCs shall not be AOs or CHs within the same hierarchy. In cases where commands have limited numbers of personnel to execute the GCPC Program and an APC must be an AO, an app roved waiver is NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-24 required from Do N Consolidated Card Program M anagement Division (CCPMD). All requests must be forwarded through NSTC N41 to NETC for approval. b. Individuals designated as AOs shall not be assigned as CHs or as APCs within the same hierarchy. If personnel considerations require an AO to be a CH, under no circumstances shall any CH be their own AO. In addition, AOs should be, to the greatest extent possible, the supervisor of the CH or be in the direct line of authority of their CH but not supervisor of their APC. File Retention . Financial documents (invoices, dispute documentations, receipts, etc.) shall be retained for a period of ten years and three months. Non -financial documents shall be retained for a period of three years (e.g., training certificates). Requirement Document . An appr oved Requirement Document in the form of a Purchase Order Request Form, generally referred to as a PORF in the NSTC domain, or a DD Form 282 DoD Printing/Requisition Form is required for all purchases. The purchase may not be accomplished until the PORF o r DD282 contains the approving signatures of the GCPC Cardholder, the GCPC Approving Official and the Comptroller Fund Approver. Purchases prior to a fully completed and approved PORF or DD282 constitutes an \"UNAUTHORIZED COMMITMENT,\" subjecting the CH to civil and criminal penalties. The NSTC PORF with instructions can be found in the online NROTC Supply Binder. The Supply Technician may optionally, but not in place of the PORF, implement an additional requirement form, separate and distinct from the PO RF, that is prepared and signed by the individual requiring the supply or service. This ensures required Separation of Function and places the responsibility of requirements definition on the proper party, the customer. A sample of this form is available from NSTC N4. Miscellaneous Documents . NROTC unit CHs (military and civilian) shall ensure a Miscellaneous Document (internally) is created in FASTDATA prior to making credit card purchases. FASTDATA shall reflect funds availability. If funds are not available, the CH is not authorized to make the purchases(s). Proceeding without available funds constitutes an \"UNAUTHORIZED COMMITMENT,\" subjecting the CH to civil and criminal penalties. Convenience Checks . Convenience Checks are used to acquire authorized supplies or services that cannot be acquired using the GCPC. Not all NROTC units have a Convenience Check program. Convenience Check accounts are managed like CH accounts and require additional oversight and reporting. Due to this, it is re commended that Convenience Check accounts and usage are minimized. Convenience Check writers have the same basic responsibilities as CH. a. Prior to establishing a convenience check account, the NROTC unit must have an active GCPC program in plac e. b. Requests must be justified in writing, approved by the commander, and coordinated through NSTC N4 and the Naval Education Training Command (NETC) GCPC Level III APC. c. Convenience check use incurs both a flat fee and a percentage fee in addition to the face value. Convenience checks may only be used after the NROTC unit has made every attempt to use the GCPC. d. NROTC units shall establish internal contro ls to include approval at least one level above the check writer. e. An officer or equivalent Do D civilian who is independent of the office maintaining the account must audit Convenience Check accounts yearly on an unannounced basis. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 8-25 f. Conveni ence check use has Internal Revenue Service reporting requirements. Details are available on the web at DFAS4DOD. 8-15 Member POV Parking Reimbursement Amount Reimbursable . Per Section 020606 (Recruiter -Related Parking Expenses) of the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), a DoD Service member or civilian employee who incurs parking expenses of more than $20 a month while on official duty is eligible for reimbursement when detai led for instructional and administrative duties at any institution where a Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps unit is located. The member is authorized reimbursement for parking not to exceed $255 a month. Monthly parking expenses of $20 or less are n ot reimbursed. Reimbursements may be on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. OF 1164 or Local Voucher .

If a member is eligible for reimbursement, reimbursement shall be made via an OF 1164 or use local voucher in the DTS. POC is N STC N8. 8-16 Tutorial Services 1. Tutoring in the subjects of calculus and physics is authorized. Units may submit a waiver request to include additional subjects via NSTC N93 and NSTC N8 with justification included. 2. Eligibility . Only Scholarship midshipmen are eligible for tutoring services. Units may share tutorial services with other military service ROTC units as long as expenses are shared. If a flat hourly rate is charged, and no additional costs are incurred, non -Scholarship midshipmen may attend tutoring sessions contracted for Scholarship students who must be in attendance. 3. Funding . Tutorial service costs shall be included in the unit's annual OMN OPTAR requests. 4. Procurement . Tutoring may be procured via a number of differen t ways including the Educational Service Agreement at those NROTCS where tutoring is offered through the educational institution, GCPC, and Convenience Check. Beginning in July, 2019, with the issue of the Next Generation Educational Services agreements, payment using the ESA is the preferred method. 5. NROTC Midshipmen and Staff are not eligible for additional compensation for tutoring midshipmen. 8-17 Educational Institution Telephone and Network Services Units that receive department funds from the u niversity shall use these funds to pay for all university provided landlines and network charges.

DoDMERB is the D oD agency responsible for the determination of medical acceptability of appl icants for appointment to United States Service Academies , the USUHS , and the ROTC programs of the United States Armed Forces . DoDMERB determines medical acceptability for NROTC Scholarship, College Program Advanced Standing, and SSMP Program s. 9-2 Medical Examinations General . The DoDMERB accession physical is valid for two years . Additionally, it may be used for commissioning purposes for up to five years (does not apply to some specialized programs) . Report of Medical Examination DD Form 2808 documents physical examination results for civilian applicants. National Four -Year Scholarship Recipients a. An annual Official Mail M essage requires units to identify which students have reported to the unit. Units will download the DD Form 2808 (Report of Medical Examination) from the DoDMERB website by following the \"Shipped Physicals\" link. A copy of the DD Form 2808 will be filed in the midshipman's health record. b. Natio nal Four -Year Scholarship midshipmen are notified of their selection in writing by NSTC N92 (Navy Option) MCRC (ON/E) (Marine Option) . The letter contains instructions for scheduling a medical examination . Data, including zip code, contained in OPMIS is used by DoDMERB to assign applicants to DoDMER B-approved civilian doctors or MTF s, assigning a physician or medical care provider near the applicant's home of record . The applicant is res ponsible for completing the DoDMERB medical examination . The applicant is also responsible for obtaining any additional tests or clinical abstracts that DoDMERB may direct . In most cases, DoDMERB may fund the cost of requested additional testing . Applicants should have their DoDMERB medical examination completed a s soon as possible. c. After reviewing the Report of Medical Examination DD Form 2808 , DoDMERB will post the applicant's physical status on the DoDMERB secure website . Applicants deemed physically qualified will receive a \"Q\" code . Applicants deemed physically disqualified initially receive a \" Y\" code , pending waiver consideration . If no waiver is granted the applicant will receive a \"Z\" code. The applicant's NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 9-2 physical status is then d ownloaded into the OPMIS placement file and is maintained there until NSTC N92 purges the file in October . The physical status of midshipmen determined to be physically qualified after the placement files are purged will not be automatically updated in OPMIS and the unit must manually enter their medical status. Note: Height standards per the Navy Officer Recruiting Manual are 57\" to 80\". Because of age, some midshipmen may grow into minimum height standards and become eligible for advanced standing o r scholarship; thus, they may participate in College Program Basic. d. DoDMERB will identify the medical examinations for applicants deemed not physically qualifie d. Those applicant's medical information is automatically sent to BUMED for review and waiver recommendation. BUMED reviews requests for waivers of physical standards for all applicants seeking entry into the U.S . Navy or Marine Corps and uploads waiver recommendations into WebWave . NSTC N92A reviews the recommendation from BUMED, stamps the BUME D letter, and makes a recommendation to NSTC N9 . The Deputy by CNSTC, may concur with the BUMED recommendation and stamps the letter as appropriate . If N04 does not concur with the BU MED recommendation, the BUMED letter will be forwarded to CNSTC for a waiver determination . NSTC N92A will update the DoDMERB website with the waiver authority decision, triggering a file transfer that updates both OPMIS and the applicant's NROTC online a pplication . In OPMIS, those d eemed not physically qualified but received a waiver are granted a code of the \"W,\" while those who are denied a waiver receive a \"Z\" code . NSTC N92A will inform the applicant and the unit by letter of the waiver authority decision. e. Midshipman candidates disqualified or pending physical qualification at the start of class may not sign any scholarship agreement or receive any benefits . However, they may participate in the physical training aspects of the program with written clearance from a physician . Midshipmen waived or deemed physically qualified after the commencement of the academic term may be entitled to retroactive benefits, except subsistence. Other Scholarship and College Program Advanced Standing Midshipmen . Students nominated for other scholarships ( 2-year National, NSTC Controlled, etc.) or College Program Advanced Standing must be found medically qualified or waived prior to receiving benefits . The basic procedures addressed for Four -Year National Scholarship recipients apply . Howeve r, the NROTC unit is responsible for contacting the local MTF or DoDMERB authorized physicians to schedule the DoDMERB medical examination . To avoid any delay in benefits, the medical examination should be completed as soon as the applicant applies for S cholarship or Advanced Standing . The process is initiated by the Unit signing in to the DoDMETS website ( https://www.dodmets.com/DetLogin.aspx ). Signing in via the \"detachment login\" option (the detach ment number is the Unit's code). Once logged in, the Unit will enter specific information about the applicant (the same info that NSTC would send to DoDMERB if they were a National selectee). Once that information is entered, the midshipman can go to the DoDMETS website and log in via the \"Applicant Login\" option. There they will get the information they need to complete their physical exam. If you have any problems, call the DoDMETS helpdesk at 215 -587-9600. Once the medical examination is completed, the units review the DoDMERB website to determine status, and enter the appropri ate physical qualification codes in OPMIS . As with National Scholarship recipients, DoDMERB will identify the medical examinations for applicants deemed not physically qualifi ed. Those applicant's medical information is automatically sent to BUMED for review and waiver recommendation. See paragraph 2.d. If the unit would like to provide a non -medical assessment on behalf of their midshipmen, it should be sent to DoDMERB help desk and N92A for inclusion in the medical file and consideration by BUMED. SSM NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 9-3 a. United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) . All applicants for the Merchant Marine Academy undergo a DoDMERB physical examination. DoDMERB will then post the applicant's physical qualification or disqualification status on the DoDMERB secure website a nd respond back to the applicant and USMMA . The Director of Admissions will ask BUMED to review USMMA applicants for waiver considerati on if they have a disqualifying condition per DoDMERB review and are competitive for an offer at USMMA. Applicants deemed not physically qualified or who have their waiver denied shall not be allowed to sign any service agreements. b. State Maritime Academi es. DoDMERB medical examinations for SSMP (obligated) midshipmen at the state and regional maritime academies are initiated by the unit on an individual basis . SSM will obtain their DoDMERB medical examination through an authorized DoDMERB physician . Medical examinations for applicant's deemed not physically qualified are forwarded to BUMED . Applicants deemed not physically qualified or waiver denied shall not be allowed to sign any service agreements . SSMP (non-obligated) midshipmen are not required to have a DoDMERB exam . They must receive a sports physical and complete a Report of Medical History DD Form 2807 -2 before participating in unit physical training. College Program Midshipmen Basic Standing . College Program Basic Standing midshipmen are not required to complete a DoDMERB medical examination . They must receive a sports physical and complete a n Accessions Medical Prescreen Report DD Form 2807 -2. The Professor of Naval Science (PNS) must review the Report of Medical History and determine if the midshipman is physically qualified to participate . If the midshipman indicates past or present injuries or illnesses that may be physically disqualifying in nature, the PNS should consult with BUMED to assess future eligibility . Midshipmen should not be allowed to participate in the College Program if there is a strong possibility they have a disqualifying medical condition that would not be recommended f or a waiver for Advanced Standing. STA -21 and MECEP . STA-21 OCs and MECEP Marine s mus t be determined to be medically qualified for their respective designators prior to receiving orders to their NROTC unit . While participating in their respective commissioning programs, transportation costs involved in the conduct of routine medical exami nations and/or pre -commissioning physicals are funded by the NROTC unit . Prior to commissioning, all ST A-21 OCs and MECEP Marine s must be determined to meet medical standards for pre -commissioning into their respective designators. STA -21 and MECEP Perio dic Health Assessment Process (and other Active Duty). a. Active duty member's annual PHA is required to be done by a Military Treatment Facility in person or over -the-phone. Civilian providers are no longer authorized, as they do not have access to the PHA website. All Navy and Marine Corps service members are required to complete a PHA annually. It is recommended that members start the process 60 days prior to the expiratio n of the PHA. b. The PHA can be ac cessed by the member's CAC or Do D ID and password created on registration. Users will be able to see any PHA they have created, both certified and uncertified, as well as Certification Metrics that show the progress of ce rtification on the User homepage. PHA is a four -part assessment including a self -reported health assessment, record review, mental health review, and a face - to-face or person -to-person (over the phone) consultation with a certified PHA health care provid er. The clinic performing the in -person PHA should advise you of any documentation required for you to bring to your appointment. c. Member's should follow the below process: (1) Access PHA log -in page: https://data.nmcphc.med.navy.mil/pha/. Compl ete the registration process. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 9-4 (2) Complete the survey. Note, after completion of the survey, there will be a review page. Scroll to the bottom of that page and click the green button, otherwise the PHA will not be properly finished in the sys tem. (3) Print your Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) Report from BUPERS ONLINE at https://www.bol.navy.mil. Your IMR report will show the IMR elements (HIV, dental, immunizations) that are due in conjunction with your PHA. NOTE: There is no automatic notification system built into PHA. To make an appointment, call your local clinic to let them know you have completed your portion of the PHA d. Member wil l need to locate and contact a naval h ospital or clinic to make an in -person or over -the phone appointment to complete your PHA: https://www.tricare.mil/FindDoctor/AllProviderDirectories/Military . e. Dental and immunizations status will also be reviewed. NROTC unit staff should input this information into Medical Readiness Reporting System (MRRS) so it is available for the medical personnel completin g the PHA. MRRS can be accessed through https://mrrs.dc3n.navy.mil/mrrs . 9-3 Physical Readiness OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) requires all students be medi cally screened before participating in any physical readiness training . NROTC Scholarship, College Program Advanced Standing, STA -21 and MECEP, and obligated SSM are medically screened by DoDMERB . College Program Basic Standing students must receive a recent medical screening equivalent to the university sports physical exam (notionally 90 days, but sports physicals used to attend NSI may substitute for currency) . The purpose of the sports exam is to identify midshipmen at risk of cardio -respiratory illn esses, orthopedic injuries, or other injuries/illnesses that may be aggravated by required exercises . The Accessions Medical Prescreen Report DD Form 2807 -2 is utilized to document the student's past and present medical condition. To ensure all incoming midshipmen are fit to participate in orientation, the CFL or designated representative shall verify the student's physical status in OPMIS . If the student's Personal/Program Information Form contains a \"Q\" (qualified) or \"W\" (waiver granted), the student is physically qualified to participate . If the student's Personal/Program Information Form contains an \"R\" (remedial) or \"Y\" (waiver pending), or \"Z\" (waive r denied), the student is not physically qualified to participate, unless a sports physical is provided to the unit, allowing for Physical Training (PT) activities. All students will comply with the Physical Readiness Program as directed in OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series ) or Marine Corps Physical Fitness Program in MCO 6100.13A . The designated CFL is responsible for ensuring all Navy students complete a Physical Activity Risk Factor Questionna ire (PARFQ ) prior to their first unit directed physical training activity. Blank PARFQs are available on the Physical Readiness Informatio n Management Systems (PRIMS) website. For midshipmen a periodic health assessment (PHA) is complete when the annual requirement for Annual Certificates of Physical Condition, NSTC 1533/107 , is met and any concerns appropriately addressed. The CFL will review and sign the PARFQ form which indicate the student may take the PFA. The PNS will review and sign all other PARFQs. Medical evaluations must be conducted as indicated by the PARFQ or if the student is out-of-standards per OPNAVINST 6110.1 (series) before the student can participate in the PFA/PFT/CFT or unit fitness training. The completed PARFQ is filed in the student's health record. In the case of College Program Basic Standing students, the form is filed in the NROTC Student File until the health record is opened. The PNS must ensure all students complete Annual Certificates of Physical Condition, NSTC 1533/107 , and PARFQ prior to each PRT. Graduating seniors and fifth year students will also complete NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 9-5 this form at the beginning of their last term just pr ior to graduation . The PNS should carefully review the student's response to all questions . Sometimes injuries, accidents, or illnesses that should have been reported earlier may not have been reported . If there is any doubt whether the injury, illness, or prescription could be a physically disqualifying factor, the PNS must immediately notify N92A or BUMED, Physical Qualifications and Standards M34 . Midshipmen shall be given at least a 10 -week notice prior to a PFA . The 10 -week notice may be waived fo r freshmen taking the PFA during orientation . However, in accordance with s ection 4-5, the welcome aboard letter will notify students that they will be participating in an orientation PFA. Appendix T provides universal training precautions and emergency action plan content to address sickle cell trait positive concerns. All students and staff are required to provide laboratory evidence of their Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) status. Testing for incoming scholarship freshmen (NSI or unit) will be done at NSTC expense. Testing for c ollege programmers will be at the individual's expense. The below are acceptable laboratory tests for SCT. Note: Sickle cell testing was completed for candidates that attended NSI (if not provided in advance by the candidate) and will be sent to the assigned NROTC unit. a. Hemoglobin solubility will report as positive or negative. Positive result requires follow -up testing via Hemoglobin electrophoresis ; b. Hemoglobin electrophoresis. The result will report the percentage of normal hemoglobin cells (A) and sickle cells (S). If 45% or greater of HGB S, contact N92A; c. High pressure liquid chromatography (HLPC); d. Many states performed sickle cell trait screening as a part of the newborn testing. These results can be used in lieu of the above. Note: File SCT testing results in Right side/section 4 of the medical record. A thorough review of the medical record should be accomplished prior to ordering a new test. If the unit is aware that testing was completed, a reasonable effort should be made to obtain those results from the medical clinic at which it was completed pri or to having the test repeated. 9-4 Immunizations All students are required to receive immunizations as specified below in paragraph 3 . Immunization waivers will not be granted by NSTC N9 . The PNS is responsible for establis hing procedures to ensure that S cholarship and College Program Advanced Standing midshipmen receive immunizations prior to summer training . The PNS should use local MTFs for satisfying immun ization requirements . When M TFs do not exist locally, the vaccinations may be ordered and administered by military health professionals, local university health professionals or other personnel qualified to administer vaccinations . Immunizations for MECEP students are completed at Marine Corps OCS . Immunization recommendations and requirements are contained in BUMEDINST 6230.15 (series ). Midshipmen shall provide documented proof of immunization or serological testing. Absent of proof, midshipmen will need to receive vaccination for influenza, meningococcal, Measles, -pertussis and Varicella vaccine , early as possible. If not already immunized, m idshipmen shall receive two doses of the Hepatitis A vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine before graduation (one dose before executing summer assignments orders to the operating force) . Prior to commissioning, the midshipmen or OCs must have been immunized or received the following inoculations: a. Hepatitis A vaccine ( two doses); b. Hepatitis B vaccine (three doses) c. Influenza vaccine (one dose annually) ; d. Measles/M umps/Rubella vaccine ( vaccine (two dose s); and h. Meningococcal (one or two doses depending on vaccine) . Further guidance may be obtained in the Summer Training Manual NSTC M -1533.5 . For the most current medical requirements regarding special duty communities, refer to OMMs announcing community requirements. A printed report from the electronic immunization tracking system, in International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (CDC 731 ), Health Record -Immunization Record (SF 601) or Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet (DD Form 2766) format that is accompanied by an official stamp and authorized signature with printed name of authenticating official will qualify as an official paper immunization record. . One of t hese forms must be used to record all immunizations and retained in the student's health record. See BUM EDINST 6230.15B Chapter 2 -7.(3) and MANMED Chapter 6 (Dental) and Chapter 16 for reference ( BUMED Instructions ). 9-5 Medical Leave of Absence MLOA may be initiated by the student or the PNS. If initiated by the PNS, the PNS will provide the student written notice of initiation of the MLOA process requiring the student to submit written medical information within 30 days of receipt that either supports or contests granting an MLOA. The PNS shall provide BUMED via WebWave all medical information and the non -medical assessment of the student. The PNS shall seek to obtain BUMED's recommendation on the need for an MLOA no later than the date when the next tuition payment for that student is due. The PNS may consult with BUMED at any point in the MLOA proce ss but shall not request a written recommendation from BUMED until the student's 30 -day window for providing information has expired or the student has provided complete medical information, whichever comes first. BUMED shall consider all relevant informa tion, including that provided by the student and provide its recommendation on a Statement of Physical Qualification for Continuation. NSTC M -1533.2D 18 December 2019 9-7 Upon receipt of NSTC -endorsed BUMED recommendation, the PNS shall immediately assign an MLOA to any midshipmen who BUMED has determined does not meet the required physical standards for retention. After consultation with N92A, placement on interim LOA while pending formal BUMED review of the MLOA/continuation package is at the discretion of the PNS. The PNS may not extend or remove a student from an MLOA without first consulting BUMED and NSTC N92A. When the PNS requests removal of a student from an MLOA, a clinical abstract of treatment and any special report requested shall be forwarded to BUMED. If the student participated in all assigned classes and laboratory work while on MLOA, the PNS may request retroactive tuition payments from NSTC N93. Pregnant students do not need to be placed on MLOA. Students who become pregnant may request to be placed on MLOA per the procedures outlined above. Upon delivery or termination of the pregnancy, the student must send their physical exam to BUMED only if the student was assigned MLOA. The guidance contained in Guidelines Concerning Pregnant Servicewomen, OPNAVINST 6000.1 (series ), governs participation by pregnant students in uni t activities. Normally, the MLOA period will be discontinued approximately 6 to 8 weeks after pregnancy. Students desiring to discontinue officer training due to pregnancy or birth of a child may request disenrollment per Sectio n 6-14. 9-6 Travel for Program Required Medical Examination The PNS is authorized to transport students to required medical examinations and physical consultations .

The Federal Empl oyees' Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. 8101, et seq. provides injury compensation to employees in the federal sector. Included as \"employees\" under \u00a78140(a)(2) are members of, or applicants for membership in, the NROTC - traveling to or from, or partici pating in training or unit activities. This injury or illness is considered \"in the line of duty. \" A midshipman or designated applicant from the NROTC Program who is injured while participating in unit related activities, may receive care paid for by th e Department of Labor (DOL) Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP). Emergency or urgent care consideration . In the event of an emergency or urgent care situation, the injured individual should be seen at a Military Treatment Facility (MTF), if available, that has the capacity to treat the injury/illness appropriately. However, the situation should dictate where care is sought. If initial treatment is provided at an MTF, the MTF will absorb the cost of provided treatment for a Line of Duty (LOD ) injury/illness. Regardless of how treatment is initially provided, a bill for services will likely be sent to the MIDN home of record. All bills for initial treatment and/or follow -on care costs should be collected, and must be submitted to OWCP for pa yment. a. An MTF is not always available or able to provide treatment. When that is the case, private sector emergency or urgent care should be engaged, as appropriate. Claims arising from either circumstance should be submitted to OWCP for payment, as o utlined below. b. Only in rare, unusual circumstances when the Worker's Compensation coverage/appeals have been exhausted, the Defense Health Agency - Great Lakes (DHA -GL) should be contacted at 888 -647-6676 to learn if further opportunities for continuance of care are available under 10 USC 1074(b) Armed Forces Medical and Dental Care.
