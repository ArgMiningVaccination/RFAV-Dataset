These viruses always tend to strike at those times when you're supposed to be having fun and celebrating the holidays. As we all know, there's no cure for the common cold or for the flu. When we are afflicted, all we can do is let the virus run its course and find whatever treatment we can to ease the symptoms and make us feel more comfortable. For some people of course, the threat of influenza is something to be taken a little more seriously. As we age for example, our immune systems can gradually weaken and have a harder time fighting infection, meaning the risk of complications from influenza can increase. Get Your Immune System Battle-Ready You don't have to simply resign yourself to the fact that winter colds or flu will strike at some point in the next few month: instead, you can fight. Your body has a remarkable ability to protect itself even from the virulence of the common cold. You can help it to do that by taking steps to give your immune system a boost. The time to start is now. Then your immune system will be prepared for the peak months of cold and flu season. Although there is so much we still don't know about the workings of the human immune system, we do know that as a complex and interconnected defense mechanism, it can achieve optimal performance when we take care of our general wellness. There are certain wellness care initiatives we can take to target the fortification of our immune systems. The Options for Boosting Your Immune System In considering what measures to take for guarding against colds and flu, perhaps the first thing which springs to mind is the flu vaccination. However, the average effectiveness of the vaccine is just 50 to 60% overall and the list of potential side effects includes fever, headaches, allergic reactions, and in severe cases can even cause a neurologic condition that causes weakness and paralysis throughout your body know as Guillain-Barre syndrome. Whether you get the vaccination or not, you shouldn't let that stop you from using other methods to bring your immune system up to fighting fitness for winter. There is never a bad time to consider lifestyle changes, provided they are changes for the better. As any wellness care specialist will tell you, the performance of your immune system is impaired by certain negative lifestyle habits. While thinking about preparing to fight off colds and flu in the chilly months ahead, this is as good a time as any to consider some of the following lifestyle improvement ideas: Get more sleep - There is most certainly a strong link between the amount of sleep you get and the ability of your immune system to do its best work. Take advantage of stress relieving wellness care - Chronic stress can seriously affect your immune system's ability to resist colds. Consider taking up an activity such as yoga to help you relax and where possible, reduce your exposure to stressful situations. Take some regular, moderate exercise - If you lead a largely sedentary life, it might be time to start getting out for a brisk, 30-minute walk each day. However, if you are someone who works out heavily, consider cutting back. Too much rigorous exercise is strongly believed to actually weaken the immune system. Take your vitamins- Most people do not get all the nutrients the body needs from the food we consume. Studies show that providing your body with proper nutrients in the form of a daily multi-vitamin can greatly improve your immune system. Also, taking a vitamin D3 supplement specifically is scientifically proven to have several positive effects on your immune system and may enhance your immunity and prevent the development of autoimmunity. The above are examples of things you can start or do more of, in order to give your immune system a boost. Other lifestyle changes to improve your fighting chances against colds and flu involve stopping or doing less of things which harm your immune system, for example: - Quit smoking - Moderate your intake of alcohol - Reduce your sugar intake during cold and flu season. Smoking and excessive intake of alcohol and sugary foods and drinks all inhibit your immune system's ability to fight disease. There are also many more [oc wellness solution](https://ocwellnessphysicians.com/medical-services/) benefits of stopping smoking and cutting back on sugar and alcohol, so these are perhaps some of the changes to afford the highest priority. Consider Chiropractic Wellness Care It may come as something of a surprise to know that making regular appointments for chiropractic adjustment is another way you can promote optimal performance of your immune system. It's true: your chiropractor can help you to battle colds and flu. Studies and research show us that the performance of the body's immune system is linked to that of the central nervous system. As a treatment which works directly on the nervous system through correcting spinal alignment, chiropractic care is strongly beneficial in improving general wellness, which includes immunity to infection and disease.
