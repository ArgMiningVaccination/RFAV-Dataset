Several external or internal factors to the human being interfere in a transversal and complex way, forcing new concepts and technical-scientific methodologies in order to overcome somatic or mental imbalances. Thus, it is increasingly observed that psychic and physical or biopsychosomatic human well-being is a final result of several interactions from environmental agents in confrontation with the immunological and neurological response capacity of internal components. This state of affairs sometimes calls, whenever possible, for expeditious, simple, and natural methods, since access to healthcare is sometimes expensively unnecessary. Therefore, we can say that we need to build more flexible approaches, in addition to agile, reliable, and transversal health approaches for everyone. In this context, we are sufficiently motivated and proud to invite skilled scientists with an interest in global and integrative healthcare to present their studies in peer-reviewed papers in our Collection Project. Cross-disciplinary research will be important in the future. This issue will be open for all possible topics related to global health, e.g., reproductive health, occupational health, \"forgotten health problems\", child and adolescent health, and infectious and chronic diseases, such as cancer, COVID-19 infection, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic, neurodegenerative, and immunodeficiency diseases. Thus, approaches on acupuncture effects, phytotherapy, decoctions, nutritional or dietetic supplements, Asian or Western physical and breathing exercises, as well as in silico intelligence medicine studies using bioresonance integrators are welcome. The journal has excellent reviewers and adequate research specialists, with a rapidly increasing impact as well as a quick and thorough review process. Thus, you are welcome to join us in this interesting Project Collection. Dr. Jorge P.
