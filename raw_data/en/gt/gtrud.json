RCW 41.05A.120 and 2011 1st sp.s. c 15 s 99 are each 22 amended to read as follows: 23 (1) After service of a notice of debt for an overpayment as 24 provided for in RCW 41.05A.110 or 41.05A.170 , stating the debt 25 accrued, the director may issue to any person, firm, corporation, 26 association, political subdivision, or department of the state an 27 order to withhold and deliver property of any kind including, but not 28 restricted to, earnings which are due, owing, or belonging to the 29 debtor, when the director has reason to believe that there is in the 30 possession of such person, firm, corporation, association, political 31 subdivision, or department of the state property which is due, owing, 32 or belonging to the debtor. The order to withhold and deliver must 33 state the amount of the debt, and must state in summary the terms of 34 this section, RCW 6.27.150 and 6.27.160 , chapters 6.13 and 6.15 RCW, 35 15 U.S.C.

Any person, firm, corporation, association, 1 political subdivision, or department of the state upon whom service 2 has been made shall answer the order to withhold and deliver within 3 twenty days, exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in 4 writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of 5 therein. The director may require further and additional answers to 6 be completed by the person, firm, corporation, association, political 7 subdivision, or department of the state. If any such person, firm, 8 corporation, association, political subdivision, or department of the 9 state possesses any property which may be subject to the claim of the 10 authority, such property must be withheld immediately upon receipt of 11 the order to withhold and deliver and must, after the twenty -day 12 period, upon demand, be delivered forthwith to the director. The 13 director shall hold the property in trust for application on the 14 indebtedness involved or for return, without interest, in accordance 15 with final determination of liability or nonliability. In the 16 alternative, there may be furnished to the director a good and 17 sufficient bond, satisfactory to the director, conditioned upon final 18 determination of liability.

The state also warrants and represents that it shall defend 32 and hold harmless for such actions persons withholding money or 33 property pursuant to this chapter. 34 (2) The director shall also, on or before the date of service of 35 the order to withhold and deliver, mail or cause to be mailed by 36 certified mail a copy of the order to withhold and deliver to the 37 debtor at the debtor's last known post office address or, in the 38 alternative, a copy of the order to withhold and deliver must be 39 served on the debtor in the same manner as a summons in a civil 40 p. 31 SB 5700action on or before the date of service of the order or within two 1 days thereafter. The copy of the order must be mailed or served 2 together with a concise explanation of the right to petition for a 3 hearing on any issue related to the collection. This requirement is 4 not jurisdictional, but, if the copy is not mailed or served as 5 provided in this section, or if any irregularity appears with respect 6 to the mailing or service, the superior court, on its discretion on 7 motion of the debtor promptly made and supported by affidavit showing 8 that the debtor has suffered substantial injury due to the failure to 9 mail the copy, may set aside the order to withhold and deliver and 10 award to the debtor an amount equal to the damages resulting from the 11 director's failure to serve on or mail to the debtor the copy. 12 Sec. 27.

The authority shall make eligibility 33 determinations within the time frames for establishing eligibility 34 for children on medical assistance, as defined by RCW 74.09.510 . The 35 application and annual renewal processes shall be designed to 36 minimize administrative barriers for applicants and enrolled clients, 37 and to minimize gaps in eligibility for families who are eligible for 38 coverage. If a change in family income results in a change in the 39 p. 53 SB 5700source of funding for coverage, the authority shall transfer the 1 family members to the appropriate source of funding and notify the 2 family with respect to any change in premium obligation, without a 3 break in eligibility. The authority shall use the same eligibility 4 redetermination and appeals procedures as those provided for children 5 on medical assistance programs. The authority shall modify its 6 eligibility renewal procedures to lower the percentage of children 7 failing to annually renew. The authority shall manage its outreach, 8 application, and renewal procedures with the goals of: (a) Achieving 9 year by year improvements in enrollment, enrollment rates, renewals, 10 and renewal rates; (b) maximizing the use of existing program 11 databases to obtain information related to earned and unearned income 12 for purposes of eligibility determination and renewals, including, 13 but not limited to, the basic food program, the child care subsidy 14 program, federal social security administration programs, and the 15 employment security department wage database; (c) streamlining 16 renewal processes to rely primarily upon data matches, online 17 submissions, and telephone interviews; and (d) implementing any other 18 eligibility determination and renewal processes to allow the state to 19 receive an enhanced federal matching rate and additional federal 20 outreach funding available through the federal children's health 21 insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 by January 2010. The 22 department shall advise the governor and the legislature regarding 23 the status of these efforts by September 30, 2009. The information 24 provided should include the status of the department's efforts, the 25 anticipated impact of those efforts on enrollment, and the costs 26 associated with that enrollment. 27 (3) To ensure continuity of care and ease of understanding for 28 families and health care providers, and to maximize the efficiency of 29 the program, the amount, scope, and duration of health care services 30 provided to children under this section shall be the same as that 31 provided to children under medical assistance, as defined in RCW 32 74.09.520 . 33 (4) The primary mechanism for purchasing health care coverage 34 under this section shall be through contracts with managed health 35 care systems as defined in RCW 74.09.522 , subject to conditions, 36 limitations, and appropriations provided in the biennial 37 appropriations act. However, the authority shall make every effort 38 within available resources to purchase health care coverage for 39 uninsured children whose families have access to dependent coverage 40 p. 54 SB 5700through an employer-sponsored health plan or another source when it 1 is cost-effective for the state to do so, and the purchase is 2 consistent with requirements of Title XIX and Title XXI of the 3 federal social security act. To the extent allowable under federal 4 law, the authority shall require families to enroll in available 5 employer-sponsored coverage, as a condition of participating in the 6 program established under this section, when it is cost-effective for 7 the state to do so. Families who enroll in available employer- 8 sponsored coverage under this section shall be accounted for 9 separately in the annual report required by RCW 74.09.053 . 10 (5)(a) To reflect appropriate parental responsibility, the 11 authority shall develop and implement a schedule of premiums for 12 children's health care coverage due to the authority from families 13 with income greater than ((two hundred )) 210 percent of the federal 14 poverty level. For families with income greater than ((two hundred 15 fifty )) 260 percent of the federal poverty level, the premiums shall 16 be established in consultation with the senate majority and minority 17 leaders and the speaker and minority leader of the house of 18 representatives. For children eligible for coverage under the 19 federally funded children's health insurance program, Title XXI of 20 the federal social security act, premiums shall be set at a 21 reasonable level that does not pose a barrier to enrollment. The 22 amount of the premium shall be based upon family income and shall not 23 exceed the premium limitations in Title XXI of the federal social 24 security act. For children who are not eligible for coverage under 25 the federally funded children's health insurance program, premiums 26 shall be set every two years in an amount no greater than the average 27 state-only share of the per capita cost of coverage in the state- 28 funded children's health program. 29 (b) Premiums shall not be imposed on children in households at or 30 below ((two hundred )) 210 percent of the federal poverty level as 31 articulated in RCW 74.09.055 . 32 (c) ((Beginning no later than January 1, 2010, the )) The 33 authority shall offer families whose income is greater than ((three 34 hundred )) 312 percent of the federal poverty level the opportunity to 35 purchase health care coverage for their children through the programs 36 administered under this section without an explicit premium subsidy 37 from the state. The design of the health benefit package offered to 38 these children should provide a benefit package substantially similar 39 to that offered in the apple health for kids program, and may differ 40 p. 55 SB 5700with respect to cost-sharing, and other appropriate elements from 1 that provided to children under subsection (3) of this section 2 including, but not limited to, application of preexisting conditions, 3 waiting periods, and other design changes needed to offer affordable 4 coverage. The amount paid by the family shall be in an amount equal 5 to the rate paid by the state to the managed health care system for 6 coverage of the child, including any associated and administrative 7 costs to the state of providing coverage for the child. Any pooling 8 of the program enrollees that results in state fiscal impact must be 9 identified and brought to the legislature for consideration. 10 (6) The authority shall undertake and continue a proactive, 11 targeted outreach and education effort with the goal of enrolling 12 children in health coverage and improving the health literacy of 13 youth and parents. The authority shall collaborate with the 14 department of social and health services, department of health, local 15 public health jurisdictions, the office of the superintendent of 16 public instruction, the department of children, youth, and families, 17 health educators, health care providers, health carriers, community- 18 based organizations, and parents in the design and development of 19 this effort. The outreach and education effort shall include the 20 following components: 21 (a) Broad dissemination of information about the availability of 22 coverage, including media campaigns; 23 (b) Assistance with completing applications, and community-based 24 outreach efforts to help people apply for coverage. Community-based 25 outreach efforts should be targeted to the populations least likely 26 to be covered; 27 (c) Use of existing systems, such as enrollment information from 28 the free and reduced -price lunch program, the department of children, 29 youth, and families child care subsidy program, the department of 30 health's women, infants, and children program, and the early 31 childhood education and assistance program, to identify children who 32 may be eligible but not enrolled in coverage; 33 (d) Contracting with community-based organizations and government 34 entities to support community-based outreach efforts to help families 35 apply for coverage. These efforts should be targeted to the 36 populations least likely to be covered. The authority shall provide 37 informational materials for use by government entities and community- 38 based organizations in their outreach activities, and should identify 39 any available federal matching funds to support these efforts; 40 p. 56 SB 5700(e) Development and dissemination of materials to engage and 1 inform parents and families statewide on issues such as: The benefits 2 of health insurance coverage; the appropriate use of health services, 3 including primary care provided by health care practitioners licensed 4 under chapters 18.71 , 18.57 services; the value of a medical home, well-child services and 6 immunization, and other preventive health services with linkages to 7 department of health child profile efforts; identifying and managing 8 chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes; and the value of good 9 nutrition and physical activity; 10 (f) An evaluation of the outreach and education efforts, based 11 upon clear, cost-effective outcome measures that are included in 12 contracts with entities that undertake components of the outreach and 13 education effort; 14 (g) An implementation plan to develop online application 15 capability that is integrated with the automated client eligibility 16 system, and to develop data linkages with the office of the 17 superintendent of public instruction for free and reduced -price lunch 18 enrollment information and the department of children, youth, and 19 families for child care subsidy program enrollment information. 20 (7) The authority shall take action to increase the number of 21 primary care physicians providing dental disease preventive services 22 including oral health screenings, risk assessment, family education, 23 the application of fluoride varnish, and referral to a dentist as 24 needed. 25 (8) The department shall monitor the rates of substitution 26 between private -sector health care coverage and the coverage provided 27 under this section. 28 Sec. 41. RCW 74.09.4701 and 2011 c 4 s 19 are each amended to 29 read as follows: 30 For apple health for kids, the department shall not count the 31 twenty-five dollar increase paid as part of an individual's weekly 32 benefit amount ((as provided in RCW 50.20.1202 )) when determining 33 family income, eligibility, and payment levels. 34 Sec. 42.

Such indicators may include, but are not 9 limited to: 10 (a) Childhood immunization rates; 11 (b) Well child care utilization rates, including the use of 12 behavioral and oral health screening, and validated, structured 13 developmental screens using tools, that are consistent with 14 nationally accepted pediatric guidelines and recommended 15 administration schedule, once funding is specifically appropriated 16 for this purpose; 17 (c) Care management for children with chronic illnesses; 18 (d) Emergency room utilization; 19 (e) Visual acuity and eye health; 20 (f) Preventive oral health service utilization; and 21 (g) Children's mental health status. In defining these measures 22 the authority shall be guided by the measures provided in RCW 23 71.36.025 . 24 Performance measures and targets for each performance measure 25 must be established and monitored each biennium, with a goal of 26 achieving measurable, improved health outcomes for the children of 27 Washington state each biennium. 28 (2) Beginning in calendar year 2009, targeted provider rate 29 increases shall be linked to quality improvement measures established 30 under this section. The authority, in conjunction with those groups 31 identified in subsection (1) of this section, shall develop 32 parameters for determining criteria for increased payment, 33 alternative payment methodologies, or other incentives for those 34 practices and health plans that incorporate evidence-based practice 35 ((and improve )) and achieve sustained improvement with respect to the 36 measures. 37 (3) The department shall provide a report to the governor and the 38 legislature related to provider performance on these measures, as 39 well as the information collected under RCW 74.09.475 , beginning in 40 p. 58 SB 5700September 2010 for 2007 through 2009 and the authority shall provide 1 the report biennially thereafter. 2 Sec. 43.

9 (f) The authority shall seek waivers from federal requirements as 10 necessary to implement this chapter; 11 (g) The authority shall, wherever possible, enter into prepaid 12 capitation contracts that include inpatient care. However, if this is 13 not possible or feasible, the authority may enter into prepaid 14 capitation contracts that do not include inpatient care; 15 (h) The authority shall define those circumstances under which a 16 managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization is responsible for 17 out-of-plan services and assure that recipients shall not be charged 18 for such services; 19 (i) Nothing in this section prevents the authority from entering 20 into similar agreements for other groups of people eligible to 21 receive services under this chapter; and 22 (j) The authority must consult with the federal center for 23 medicare and medicaid innovation and seek funding opportunities to 24 support health homes. 25 (3) The authority shall ensure that publicly supported community 26 health centers and providers in rural areas, who show serious intent 27 and apparent capability to participate as managed ((health )) care 28 ((systems )) organizations are seriously considered as contractors. 29 The authority shall coordinate its managed care activities with 30 activities under chapter 70.47 RCW . 31 (4) The authority shall work jointly with the state of Oregon and 32 other states in this geographical region in order to develop 33 recommendations to be presented to the appropriate federal agencies 34 and the United States congress for improving health care of the poor, 35 while controlling related costs. 36 (5) The legislature finds that competition in the managed health 37 care marketplace is enhanced, in the long term, by the existence of a 38 large number of managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization 39 options for medicaid clients. In a managed care delivery system, 40 p. 61 SB 5700whose goal is to focus on prevention, primary care, and improved 1 enrollee health status, continuity in care relationships is of 2 substantial importance, and disruption to clients and health care 3 providers should be minimized. To help ensure these goals are met, 4 the following principles shall guide the authority in its healthy 5 options managed health care purchasing efforts: 6 (a) All managed ((health )) care ((systems )) organizations should 7 have an opportunity to contract with the authority to the extent that 8 minimum contracting requirements defined by the authority are met, at 9 payment rates that enable the authority to operate as far below 10 appropriated spending levels as possible, consistent with the 11 principles established in this section. 12 (b) Managed ((health )) care ((systems )) organizations should 13 compete for the award of contracts and assignment of medicaid 14 beneficiaries who do not voluntarily select a contracting system, 15 based upon: 16 (i) Demonstrated commitment to or experience in serving low- 17 income populations; 18 (ii) Quality of services provided to enrollees; 19 (iii) Accessibility, including appropriate utilization, of 20 services offered to enrollees; 21 (iv) Demonstrated capability to perform contracted services, 22 including ability to supply an adequate provider network; 23 (v) Payment rates; and 24 (vi) The ability to meet other specifically defined contract 25 requirements established by the authority, including consideration of 26 past and current performance and participation in other state or 27 federal health programs as a contractor. 28 (c) Consideration should be given to using multiple year 29 contracting periods. 30 (d) Quality, accessibility, and demonstrated commitment to 31 serving low-income populations shall be given significant weight in 32 the contracting, evaluation, and assignment process. 33 (e) All contractors that are regulated health carriers must meet 34 state minimum net worth requirements as defined in applicable state 35 laws. The authority shall adopt rules establishing the minimum net 36 worth requirements for contractors that are not regulated health 37 carriers. This subsection does not limit the authority of the 38 Washington state health care authority to take action under a 39 contract upon finding that a contractor's financial status seriously 40 p. 62 SB 5700jeopardizes the contractor's ability to meet its contract 1 obligations. 2 (f) Procedures for resolution of disputes between the authority 3 and contract bidders or the authority and contracting carriers 4 related to the award of, or failure to award, a managed care contract 5 must be clearly set out in the procurement document. 6 (6) The authority may apply the principles set forth in 7 subsection (5) of this section to its managed health care purchasing 8 efforts on behalf of clients receiving supplemental security income 9 benefits to the extent appropriate. 10 (7) Any contract with a managed ((health )) care ((system )) 11 organization to provide services to medical assistance enrollees 12 shall require that managed ((health )) care ((systems )) organizations 13 offer contracts to mental health providers and substance use disorder 14 treatment providers to provide access to primary care services 15 integrated into behavioral health clinical settings, for individuals 16 with behavioral health and medical comorbidities. 17 (8) Managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization contracts 18 effective on or after April 1, 2016, shall serve geographic areas 19 that correspond to the regional service areas established in RCW 20 74.09.870 . 21 (9) A managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization shall pay a 22 nonparticipating provider that provides a service covered under this 23 chapter or other applicable law to the ((system's )) organization's 24 enrollee no more than the lowest amount paid for that service under 25 the managed ((health )) care ((system's )) organization's contracts 26 with similar providers in the state if the managed ((health )) care 27 ((system )) organization has made good faith efforts to contract with 28 the nonparticipating provider. 29 (10) For services covered under this chapter or other applicable 30 law to medical assistance or medical care services enrollees, 31 nonparticipating providers must accept as payment in full the amount 32 paid by the managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization under 33 subsection (9) of this section in addition to any deductible, 34 coinsurance, or copayment that is due from the enrollee for the 35 service provided. An enrollee is not liable to any nonparticipating 36 provider for covered services, except for amounts due for any 37 deductible, coinsurance, or copayment under the terms and conditions 38 set forth in the managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization 39 contract to provide services under this section. 40 p. 63 SB 5700(11) Pursuant to federal managed care access standards, 42 C.F.R. 1 Sec. 438, managed ((health )) care ((systems )) organizations must 2 maintain a network of appropriate providers that is supported by 3 written agreements sufficient to provide adequate access to all 4 services covered under the contract with the authority, including 5 hospital-based physician services. The authority will monitor and 6 periodically report on the proportion of services provided by 7 contracted providers and nonparticipating providers, by county, for 8 each managed ((health )) care ((system )) organization to ensure that 9 managed health care systems are meeting network adequacy 10 requirements. No later than January 1st of each year, the authority 11 will review and report its findings to the appropriate policy and 12 fiscal committees of the legislature for the preceding state fiscal 13 year. 14 (12) Payments under RCW 74.60.130 are exempt from this section. 15 Sec. 44. RCW 74.09.630 and 2021 c 273 s 5 are each amended to 16 read as follows: 17 Until the opioid overdose reversal medication bulk purchasing and 18 distribution program established in RCW 70.14.170 is operational: 19 (1) ((Upon initiation or renewal of a contract with the authority 20 to administer a )) All medicaid managed care ((plan, a managed care )) 21 organization s must reimburse a hospital or behavioral health agency 22 for dispensing or distributing opioid overdose reversal medication to 23 a covered person under RCW 70.41.485 and 71.24.594 . 24 (2) If the person is not enrolled in a medicaid managed care 25 ((plan )) organization and does not have any other available insurance 26 coverage, the authority must reimburse a hospital, behavioral health 27 agency, or pharmacy for dispensing or distributing opioid overdose 28 reversal medication under RCW 70.41.485 29 Sec. 45.

RCW 74.09.650 and 2003 1st sp.s. c 29 s 2 are each 16 amended to read as follows: 17 (1) To the extent funds are appropriated specifically for this 18 purpose, and subject to any conditions placed on appropriations made 19 for this purpose, the ((department )) authority shall design a 20 medicaid prescription drug assistance program. Neither the benefits 21 of, nor eligibility for, the program is considered to be an 22 entitlement. 23 (2) The ((department )) authority shall request any federal waiver 24 necessary to implement this program. Consistent with federal waiver 25 conditions, the department may charge enrollment fees, premiums, or 26 point-of-service cost-sharing to program enrollees. 27 (3) Eligibility for this program is limited to persons: 28 (a) Who are eligible for medicare or age sixty-five and older; 29 (b) Whose family income does not exceed two hundred percent of 30 the federal poverty level as adjusted for family size and determined 31 annually by the federal department of health and human services; 32 (c) Who lack insurance that provides prescription drug coverage; 33 and 34 (d) Who are not otherwise eligible under Title XIX of the federal 35 social security act. 36 (4) The ((department )) authority shall use a cost-effective 37 prescription drug benefit design.

The benefit 2 design may include a deductible benefit that provides coverage when 3 enrollees incur higher prescription drug costs as defined by the 4 department. The ((department )) authority also may offer more than one 5 benefit design. 6 (5) The ((department )) authority shall limit enrollment of 7 persons who qualify for the program so as to prevent an 8 overexpenditure of appropriations for this program or to assure 9 necessary compliance with federal waiver budget neutrality 10 requirements. The ((department )) authority may not reduce existing 11 medical assistance program eligibility or benefits to assure 12 compliance with federal waiver budget neutrality requirements. 13 (6) Premiums paid by medicaid enrollees not in the medicaid 14 prescription drug assistance program may not be used to finance the 15 medicaid prescription drug assistance program. 16 (7) This program will be terminated within twelve months after 17 implementation of a prescription drug benefit under Title XVIII of 18 the federal social security act. 19 (((8) The department shall provide recommendations to the 20 appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives by 21 November 15, 2003, on financing options available to support the 22 medicaid prescription drug assistance program.
