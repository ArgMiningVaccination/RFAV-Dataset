They have special training in using diet, vitamins, herbs, homeopathy, manual and energetic techniques to treat disease. We are bombarded by new health trends every year. What is right for someone else may not be right for you. I look at each patient as an individual with unique needs. Through laboratory and in-office testing- as well as much discussion- we arrive at a treatment plan that fits your diagnosis, your body and your lifestyle. I see people of all ages for acute and chronic health concerns, well child visits, sports physicals, and B12 shots. I can also discuss vaccines and sign Washington state vaccine exemption forms.
