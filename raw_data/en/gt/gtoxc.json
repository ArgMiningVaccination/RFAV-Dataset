January 2nd would be m y 20 year anniversary. I have worked in different roles from my home in Bismarck the entire time covering multiple states during my career. On Monday, November 15, I will lose my employment , my pension, stock, company car and a career I have worked very har d to build! On August 12, our CEO announced a mandatory vaccination policy which no longer allo wed for proof of antibodies, masks or social distancing, wh ich had been acceptable for the five months prior. We were all owed to submit a religious or medical exemption by September 13th. Myself and a number of m y colleagues submitted our sincerely held religious beliefs , despite feeli ng completely violated sharing such personal, deeply held spiritual beliefs. On September 29, we were granted a \"temporar y religious approval\" to continue to do our jobs until November 15 , along with the demand we must find a remote position with in the company to con tinue employment if we did not get vaccinated. At the time of this letter, there were four, yes four, remote positions in the entire compan y, which has over 12,000 US based employees. As you can imagine, I, along with my colleagues, are completely devastated , frustrated, broken hearted and flat out ANGRY! Somehow w e are able to continue to do our jobs in our current capacity until November 15, when we magically become an \"undue hardship on the business\"! The kicker in this scenario is that I currently work 80% from home and worke d completely virtually for 12 months, but miraculously I'm a \"hardship\" to my employ er. I was blessed with a robust immune system that still has antibodies from fighting off a previous infection, but this proof is no longer acceptable. I am not a health r isk to anyone and am not an \"undue hardship on the business\". There are currently 91 peer reviewed studies that demonstrate antibodies are equal to or greater than any pro tection from a ny of the Emergency Use Authorization vaccines. If these treatments w ere as efficacious as they were originally belie ved to be, liability shields would not still be in place to prevent liability for every one of the manufactu rers. This is not about health and it never has been! This is a bout control! This is about companies receiving federal funding a nd needing to have a vaccination rate at a certain percentage to maintain receiving those funds! I urge all of you to ask yourselves , \"When will this stop? How many boosters will be needed next? What will be the next experimental treatment needed to provide for your family?\" Please support this legislation that allows for every North Dakota citizen to make their own medical decisions. I ask to support strong enough language to protect the North Dakota citizens that are employed by out of state companies , as well as in state business es. I look forward to the day when we can look at our friends, family, neighbors and acquaintances and see them as the person they are instead of a vaccination status! Thank you for your "}
