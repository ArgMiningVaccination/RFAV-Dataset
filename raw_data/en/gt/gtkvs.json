Students are encouraged to begin collecting documentation and obtain needed immunizations or lab tests as soon as possible after admission. If you do not have a health care provider, please see the HSIP webpage for a list of Health Care Resources and find answers to frequently asked questions. DOCUMENT SUBMISSION PROCESS Students submit their immunization and test result documentation to a web -based system called CastleBranch. Once you are accepted, your program sends instructions for creating your CastleBranch account along with deadlines for meeting requirements. Documen tation is required for each item (listed below), which you must upload to the To Do List in your CastleBranch account. This checklist helps you keep track as you obtain your health records. You can use these tips for locating your records. You will also find detailed instructions for meeting each required item in your CastleBranch account. Due to the nature of health professions training program s, exemptions are rarely granted and only in alignment with CDC recommendations, HSIP policy , and University policy and practice. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZA TIONS A primary childhood tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (DTaP/DTP/DT/Td ) series is required as well as a childhood polio series.
