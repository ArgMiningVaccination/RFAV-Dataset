With the overwhelming majority ofpatients in hospitals, home care, and nursing homes made up of people 65 and over, care of olderadults is now the core business of our health care system. Yet, in 1997, fewer than one third ofbaccalaureate nursing programs had a stand-alone course in geriatrics, and of these, only 61%were required courses. Most programs indicated that they integrated geriatrics into the curricu-lum, but the degree of integration in most courses was quite limited (Rosenfeld et al., 1999). In 2000, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) took a major step to assure the infusion of gerontological nursing into the curriculum of baccalaureate nursing programs. Incollaboration with the John A. Hartford Foundation Institute for Geriatric Nursing at New YorkUniversity, AACN developed the document Older Adults: Recommended Baccalaureate Competencies and Curricular Guidelines for Geriatric Nursing Care. Developed to parallel AACN's earlier document, The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (1998), the geriatric competencies provide baccalaureate nursing programs with a framework of how to structure curricula in order toassure graduate competencies in the care of older adults. Gerontological Nursing: Competencies for Care takes the AACN gerontological competencies to the next logical step by providing faculty with a text and online instructor's resources to foster cur-ricular implementation. Such a text is critical because in most baccalaureate programs there is atbest only one faculty member prepared in gerontological nursing. Thus, the unique approachadopted by this text can help gerontological nursing faculty transmit essential information toother faculty, thus helping to imbed the gerontological competencies throughout the curriculum.It also provides the structure for curriculum development and course content for those schoolsseeking to create free-standing required or elective courses in gerontological nursing. Mathy Mezey, EdD, RN, FAANIndependence Foundation Professor of Nursing Education Director Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing Division of Nursing, School of EducationNew York University 28438_CH00_FM_i_xxiv_.qxd 6/6/06 4:30 PM Page xvii xixPreface Although there are numerous gerontological nursing texts on the market today, this book is uniquein that it is based on an essential document from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing(AACN) and the John A. Hartford Foundation Institute for Geriatric Nursing titled Older Adults: Recommended Baccalaureate Competencies and Curricular Guidelines for Geriatric Nursing Care. This book is intended to be a basic baccalaureate-level gerontological nursing text, and it is structured toensure that students will attain the recommended competencies and knowledge necessary to pro-vide excellent care to older adults. It can be used for a stand-alone course or in sections to be inte-grated throughout a nursing curriculum. Using the recommended competencies as a guide, each chapter is written to assist students of gerontological nursing to acquire the essential knowledge and skills to provide excellent care forolder adults. Competencies as set forth in the AACN/Hartford document are listed at the begin-ning of each chapter to help direct students' learning. There are several outstanding features of the proposed text. First, the framework, as described above, is unique. In addition, the text is an edited work with a diverse authorship of over 30 con-tributors who represent all areas of gerontological nursing, including management, education, qual-ity assurance, clinical practice in a variety of settings, advanced practice roles, research, business,consulting, and academia. Interdisciplinary collaboration on several chapters involved those withbackgrounds in psychology, social work, pastoral care, pharmacy, gerontology, rehabilitation, andbusiness management. The book also includes a unique chapter on future trends in gerontology. Thetext has a user-friendly and comprehensive format with the following pedagogical features: Learning objectives Key concepts Tables Boxes Pictures/diagrams/drawings Research highlights Critical thinking exercises28438_CH00_FM_i_xxiv_.qxd 6/6/06 4:30 PM Page xix xx Preface Personal reflection exercises Case studies with questions Resource lists References (including Web sites) Recommended readings Glossary Students will be delighted to have a glossary for each chapter as well as definitions of key terms within the text. The competencies recommended by AACN/Hartford Foundation are threadedthroughout the book. Instructors will find the accompanying online instructor's resources to be helpful time-saving tools. They include suggested activities for learning and in-class exercises, examination questionsin a variety of formats, and PowerPoint slides for lectures that coincide with student readings inthe main text. This book is divided into sections that directly follow the AACN/Hartford Foundation's Rec- ommended Baccalaureate Competencies and Curricular Guidelines for Geriatric Nursing Care*.

Suchideas are influenced by your observations of fam-ily members, friends, neighbors, the media, andyour own experience with the elderly. Perhapsyou have a close relationship with your grand-parents or you have noticed the aging of yourown parents. For some of you, the aging processmay have become noticeable when you look atyourself in the mirror. But for all of us, this uni-versal phenomenon we call aging has some typeof meaning, whether or not we have taken thetime to consciously think about it. If you pictured yourself at the age of 85, what would you look like? What sights and soundswould be around you? Where would you be liv-ing? What activities would you be engaged in?This picture of yourself as an older person maybe positive or negative. The way that you viewaging and the elderly is often a product of yourown environment and the experiences to whichyou have been exposed. Negative attitudestowards aging or the elderly ( ageism ) often arise in the same way\u2014from negative past experi-ences. Many of our attitudes and ideas aboutolder adults may not be grounded in fact. Someof you may have already been exposed to ageism,which is often displayed much in the way thatsexism or racism is in people's attitudes andactions towards older people. This is yet anotherreason for studying the aging process\u2014to takea look the myths and realities, to separate factfrom fiction, and to gain a value for the wisdomof lifetimes that older adults have to offer. As you will see, the majority of you in your careers as nurses will be caring for older adultsat some point. Population statistics make thatan irrefutable fact. Because the elderly haveunique life situations and deal with physicalchanges as they age, it is essential that nurses beprepared to provide quality of care to this groupof individuals. Mathy Mezey, Director of theHartford Foundation at NYU, stated it thus:\"The population of older Americans is explod-ing. Geriatric patients are not one sub-group ofpatients but rather the core business of healthsystems\" (GeronurseOnline, 2005). As you read and study this book, you are encouraged to examine your own thoughts, val-ues, feelings, and attitudes about aging and theelderly. Perhaps you already have a positive atti-tude towards caring for the elderly. Build onthat, and consider devoting your time andefforts to the field of gerontological nursing. If,however, you are reading this chapter today withthe idea that geriatrics is a less desirable field28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 6 Definitions 7 of nursing, that only those nurses who cannotfind jobs elsewhere work in nursing homes, orthat working with older people is the last choiceyou would ever make, then you need to re-examine these feelings. Armed with the factsand some positive experiences with older adults,you may just change your mind. The older population is changing dramati- cally, and as the baby boomers (those born from1946-1964) enter the older age group and gainretirement age (as of 2008), the world will dras-tically change. This phenomenon is happeningin many other places around the globe as well asin the United States (see Chapters 2 and 23).Gerontology is the place to be! Caring for sucha huge population of older adults will presentenormous opportunities. With the over-85 agegroup being the fastest growing, the complex-ity of caring for so many people with multiplephysical and psychosocial changes will presenta challenge for the most daring of nurses. Willyou be ready? The purpose of this book is to provide the essential information needed by students ofgerontological nursing to provide quality careto older adults. In your study of this text, youwill be presented with knowledge and insightsfrom experienced professionals with expertise invarious areas of geriatrics. There are thought-provoking activities and questions for personalreflection in each chapter. Case studies will helpyou to think about and apply the information.A glossary is included at the end of the chapterto help you master key terms, and plenty oftables and figures summarize key information.Web sites are included as a means of expandingyour knowledge. Use this text as a guidebookfor your study. Use all of your resources at hand,including your instructors, to immerse yourselfin the study of the aging process. In doing so,by the end of this book you will have gained theessential competencies to provide excellent careto older adults. Definitions Gerontology is the broad term used to define the study of aging and/or the aged. This includesthe biopsychosocial aspects of aging. Under theumbrella gerontological nursing, and gerontologicalrehabilitation nursing, to name a few. What is old and who defines old age? Inter- estingly, although \"old\" is often defined as over65 years of age, this is a rather arbitrary numberset by the Social Security Administration. Today,the older age group is often divided into theyoung old (ages 65-74), the middle old (ages 75-84), and the old old , very old, or frail elderly (ages 85 and up). However, it is obvious thatthese numbers provide merely a guideline and donot actually or clearly define a true picture of thevarious strata of the aging population. Differ-ences certainly exist between biological agingand chronological aging, and between the phys-ical and emotional or social aspects of aging witheach individual. How and at what rate personsage depend upon a host of factors that will bediscussed throughout this book. The aging pop-ulation and concepts related to aging are dis-cussed further in Chapters 2 and 3. Geriatrics is often used as a generic term relating to the aged, but specifically refers tomedical care of the aged. This is why many nurs-ing journals and texts have chosen to use theterm gerontological nursing versus geriatric nursing . Social gerontology is concerned mainly with the social aspects of aging versus the bio-28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 7 8Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing logical or psychological. \"Social gerontologistsnot only draw on research from all the socialsciences\u2014sociology, psychology, economics, andpolitical science\u2014they also seek to understandhow the biological processes of aging influencethe social aspects of aging\" (Quadagno, 2005,p. 4). Geropsychology refers to specialists in psychiatry whose knowledge, expertise, andpractice are with the older population.

How much does Rose's present home and living situation con-tribute to her fears and percep-tions of aging?Rose is a 52-year-old nursing student who has returned to school for her BSNafter raising a family. She is the di-vorced mother of two grown childrenand one young grandson. In addition tobeing a full-time student in an acceler-ated program, Rose also cares for her85-year-old mother in her own homeand occasionally helps provide child-care for her grandson while his parentswork. Rose's mother has diabetes and islegally blind. Rose is taking a gerontol-ogy course this semester and finds her-self going home quite upset after thefirst week of classes when attitudestowards aging were discussed. Whilesharing with the course instructor herfeelings and surprising emotional dis-comfort, Rose is helped to identify thatshe is afraid of getting older and beingunable to care for her ailing mother andherself. As a single woman, she is un-sure that she can handle what lies aheadfor her as she is beginning to feel theeffects of aging herself. Case Study 1-128438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 8 Roles of the Gerontological Nurse 9 planning and services with a special expertise inthe needs of older adults. Cutler (2004) definesfinancial gerontology as \"the intellectual inter-section of two fields, gerontology and finance,each of which has practitioner and academiccomponents\" (p. 29). This relatively new field isfurther discussed in Chapter 23. Gerontological rehabilitation nursing combines expertise in gerontological nursingwith rehabilitation concepts and practice. Nursesworking in gerontological rehabilitation oftencare for the elderly with chronic illnesses andlong-term functional limitations such as stroke,head injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's andother neurological diseases, spinal cord injury,arthritis, joint replacements, and amputations.The purpose of gerontological rehabilitationnursing is to assist older adults with such healthdeviations to regain and maintain the highestlevel of function and independence possiblewhile preventing complications and enhancingquality of life. Gerontological nursing , then, is the aspect of gerontology that falls within the discipline ofnursing and the scope of nursing practice. Itinvolves nurses advocating for the health ofolder persons at all levels of prevention. Geron-tological nurses work with healthy elderly per-sons in their communities, the acutely ill elderlyrequiring hospitalization and treatment, and thechronically ill or disabled elderly in long-termcare facilities, skilled care, home care, and hos-pice. The scope of practice for gerontologicalnursing includes all older adults from the timeof \"old age\" until death. The specialty of gerontological nursing was first formally recognized in the early 1970s,when the Standards for Geriatric Practice (1970) and the Journal of Gerontological Nursing (1975) were first published (Eliopoulos, 2005). Geron-tological nursing is guided by standards of prac-tice that will be discussed later in this chapter.Several roles of the gerontological nurse will bediscussed in the following sections. Roles of the Gerontological Nurse Provider of Care In the role of caregiver or provider of care, thegerontological nurse gives direct, hands-on careto older adults in a variety of settings. Olderadults often present with atypical symptomsthat complicate diagnosis and treatment. Thus,the nurse as a care provider should be educatedabout the common disease processes seen in theolder population. This includes knowledge ofthe backgrounds and statistics, risk factors,signs and symptoms, usual medical treatment,nursing care through evidence-based practice,and rehabilitation if applicable. Chapters 11 and12 cover many such common problems seen inthe elderly, imparting essential information forproviding quality care. Teacher An essential part of all nursing is teaching.Gerontological nurses focus their teaching onmodifiable risk factors. Many diseases of agingcan be prevented through lifestyle modificationssuch as a healthy diet, smoking cessation, appro-priate weight maintenance, increased physicalactivity, and stress management. Nurses have aresponsibility to educate the older adult popula-tion about ways to decrease the risk of certaindisorders such as heart disease, cancer, andstroke, the leading causes of death for this group.Nurses also may develop expertise in specialized28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 9 10 Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing areas and teach skills to other nurses in order topromote quality patient care among older adults. Manager Gerontological nurses act as managers duringeveryday care as they balance the concerns of thepatient, family, nursing, and the rest of theinterdisciplinary team. Nurse managers need todevelop skills in staff coordination, time man-agement, assertiveness, communication, andorganization. Nurse managers may superviseother nursing personnel including licensed prac-tical nurses (LPNs), certified nursing assistants(CNAs), nurse technicians, nursing students,and other unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) (see Case Study 1-2 ). The role of the gerontological nurse as manager is further dis-cussed in Chapter 21. 3.

Why orwhy not?Case Study 1-228438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 10 Roles of the Gerontological Nurse 11 Advocate As an advocate, the gerontological nurse acts onbehalf of older adults to promote their best inter-ests and strengthen their autonomy and decisionmaking. Advocacy may take many forms, includ-ing active involvement at the political level orhelping to explain medical or nursing proceduresto family members on a unit level. Nurses mayalso advocate for patients through other activi-ties such as helping family members choose thebest nursing home for their loved one or listen-ing to family members vent their frustrationsabout health problems encountered. Whateverthe situation, gerontological nurses rememberthat being an advocate does not mean makingdecisions for older adults, but empoweringthem, helping them remain independent andretain dignity, even in difficult situations. Research Consumer The appropriate level of involvement for nursesat the baccalaureate level is that of research con-sumer. This involves gerontological nurses beingaware of current research literature, continuingto read and put into practice the results of reli-able and valid studies.

Althoughnurses with undergraduate degrees are moreheavily involved in research in some facilities,their basic preparation is most aimed at theresearch usage level. However, many BSN nurseshelp on research teams with data collection andby providing research ideas based on problemsencountered in the clinical setting. All nursesshould read the journals specific to their spe-cialty and continue their education by attendingseminars and workshops, pursuing additionalformal education or degrees, or obtaining certi-fication. Any of these activities promote the roleof the nurse as research consumer. Expanded roles of the gerontological nurse may also include counselor, case manager, coor-dinator of services, collaborator, geriatric caremanager, and others. Several of these roles arediscussed in other chapters (Sections 13 and 14). Basic Certification Nurses often wonder about the benefits of cer-tification. Certification in a specialty dem-onstrates expertise in that area and is often acoveted credential for employment at magnetfacilities. Even though more than half of pa-tients in acute care hospitals are over 65, lessthan 1% of all registered nurses are certified ingerontology (GeronurseOnline, 2005). Thismakes certification a valuable commodity. Some nurses argue that certification is not needed to demonstrate expertise, and that maybe true. However, nurses who aspire to becomeleaders and mentors in the field of geriatricshelp to build the specialty by demonstratingmastery of content through examination andaccountability of continued education in thisfield of expertise.Two certifications are available at the profes- sional nurse level from the American NursesCredentialing Center (ANCC). The associatedegree/diploma-level certification carries thecredential RN, Nurse, the baccalaureate-level certification carriesthe credential RN, BC (Registered Nurse,Board Certified). Table 1-1 displays the test content outline for these exams. For both exams, the basic eligibility require- ments for candidates include: 1) 2 years of full-time practice as an RN in the United States orthe equivalent thereof, 2) a minimum of 2,000hours of clinical practice in gerontological nurs-ing within the last 3 years, and 3) 30 or morecontinuing education contact hours in geronto-logical nursing within the last 3 years. TheANCC Web site (http://www.nursecredentialing.org/certification/index.html) provides moreinformation about obtaining and maintainingcertification in gerontological nursing. Roles of the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) Advanced practice in gerontological nursinggenerally falls within two aspects of the APNrole: gerontological clinical nurse specialist andgeriatric nurse practitioner. Both specialistshold a minimum of a master's degree in nursingand have passed an examination to obtain cre-dentialing in the specialty, if certified. Althoughmany family nurse practitioners (FNPs) treatolder clients or patients and develop an exper-tise in geriatrics, their education and certifica-tion is not as specific to the older adult asgerontological nurse practitioners (GNPs). The gerontological clinical nurse specialist focuses on education of patients, families, and28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 12 Roles of the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) 13 staff and often works in collaborative practicewith physicians or hospitals. The gerontologi-cal clinical nurse specialist is often an aca-demic educator, consultant, or entrepreneur. Inmany states, geriatric clinical nurse specialists(CNSs) may obtain prescriptive authority andbroaden the scope of practice. Many CNSs havedesigned and managed clinics for commonconditions in the older population, such as uri-nary incontinence, wounds, and arthritis.

This nurse special-ist has an in-depth understanding of thedynamics of aging, as well as the interventionskills necessary for health promotion and man-agement of health status alterations. The Clin-ical Nurse Specialist provides comprehensivegerontological nursing services independently orcollaboratively with multidisciplinary teams.The CNS advances the health care of olderadults and the specialty of gerontological nurs-ing through theory and research. The CNS isengaged in practice, case management, educa-tion, consultation, research, and administra-tion. (ANCC, 2005a, p. 1)The GNP is found more often in acute care settings or in collaborative practice with physi-cians who maintain offices that service a largeolder population. The Gerontological Nurse Practitioner (GNP) is an expert in providing health care toolder adults in a variety of settings, practicingindependently and collaboratively with otherhealth care professionals. In this role, the GNPworks to maximize patients' functional abili-ties. Specifically the GNP promotes, maintains,and restores health, prevents or minimizes dis-abilities, and promotes death with dignity. TheGNP engages in advanced practice, case man-agement, education, consultation, research, ad-ministration, and advocacy for older adults.(ANCC, 2005)Part of the GNP role may be making regular visits to nursing homes where patients in his orher collaborative practice reside.

GNPs also collaborate with physi-cians who care for a majority of older patients,whether in clinical settings or nursing homes.The gerontological CNS is also an expert clini-cian, but with less emphasis on diagnosis andtreatment in primary care settings and more onother aspects of care across all levels of preven-tion, usually dealing with older adults with ter-tiary problems. Educator Nurses in advanced practice will engage in edu-cation of patients, clients, staff, and other inter-disciplinary team members. The role of educatorencompasses a variety of settings, from the com-munity to acute care to tertiary care facilities.Additionally, many APNs work in academicinstitutions, teaching students in nursing col-leges, or departments within universities. Leader As a leader, the APN actively engages in advo-cating for the health of older adults. This mayinclude mentoring other nurses; acting as anintermediary for patients, family members, andother team members; or being politically activeby working to change laws to advance the careof the elderly. Nurse leaders are often seen aspioneers in research, administration, politics,law, and practice. Most nurse leaders are widelypublished. The role of leader is further discussedin Chapter 21. Researcher At the advanced practice level, nurses act asexpert consultants and clinicians in researchprojects. APNs often pose the research questionsthat arise in practice and collaborate with doc-torally prepared gerontological nurses to explore28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 15 16 Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing areas of interest. Doctorally prepared nurses areeducated to design, conduct, and analyze re-search. APNs and doctorally prepared facultywork together to obtain grant funding to carryout important research. This is often done withan interdisciplinary team when exploring topicsin gerontology because many researchable prob-lems cross various disciplines. APNs should alsokeep up to date on the latest research to be ableto serve as a resource for other staff membersabout best practices in gerontology. Consultant One of the most unique roles of the APN is thatof consultant. Nurses with advanced knowledge,education, and experience are in a special posi-tion to provide consulting services in manyareas. This may include legal consulting, work-ing with financial planners, or helping busi-nesses with programming for the elderly. Inaddition, many APNs act as educational con-sultants for large businesses or for outreach pro-grams in which they are paid to travel to anumber of places presenting workshops andseminars for their employers. Other APNs areauthors, speakers, and business owners. Advanced Certification The exams offered by the ANCC are differentfor the clinical specialist in gerontological nurs-ing and the gerontological nurse practitioner.These computerized exams are offered at over300 computer-based testing sites across thecountry 6 days per week, increasing the con-venience of sitting for certification. Requirements for certification as a clinical nurse specialist in gerontological nursing(APRN, BC) or as a gerontological nurse prac-titioner (GNP) include holding an unrestrictedprofessional license, a master's degree or higherin nursing, formal training in the specialty areaof application (i.e., a program or postgraduatecertificate program), and graduation from anaccredited program with a minimum of 500hours of supervised clinical practice in the spe-cialty (ANCC, 2005a). For the CNS designa-tion, students may sit for the exam aftergraduation if their program contained 500supervised hours in their field of study. Standards of Practice The ANA provides a publication on the scopeand standards of gerontological nursing practice . The complete book of these standards may be ordered from the ANA bookstore online(www.nursingworld.org/books). These standardsare developed by gerontological nurses and usedby them to evaluate and guide practice. Thestandards for clinical gerontological nursinginclude assessment, diagnosis, outcome identifi-cation, planning, implementation, and evalua-tion (ANA, 2001). The standards of professionalgerontological nursing performance includequality of care, performance appraisals, educa-tion, collegiality, ethics, collaboration, research,and research utilization. Students will note thatthese are the basic standards for professionalnursing, but here they are applied in the care ofthe older adult. The core competencies discussedin the next section provide more specific guide-lines for gerontological nursing care. Core Competencies The American Association of Colleges ofNursing (AACN) and the John A. HartfordFoundation sponsored the input of many quali-fied gerontological nursing experts to publish28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 16 Settings of Care 17 Older Adults: Recommended Baccalaureate Compe-tencies and Curricular Guidelines for GeriatricNursing Care (2000). This document also pro- vided the framework for this text. The core competencies set forth for gerontological nurs- ing appear in Table 1-2 . The purpose of this document specific to gerontological nursing wasto use the AACN's The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (1998) as a framework to help nurse educators integratespecific nursing content into their programs.The original AACN document suggested corecompetencies, knowledge, and role develop-ment for professional nurses. These appear inTable 1-3 . The geriatric competencies in Table 1-2 correlate with and were derived from thesuggestions in the more general AACN docu-ment in Table 1-3. By using these publisheddocuments as guides, nursing professors andother who educate in the area of gerontologicalnursing should be able to prepare students to becompetent to provide excellent care to olderadults. Settings of Care Gerontological nurses practice in a multitude ofsettings. Adults over age 65 comprise 48% ofpatients seen in the hospital, 80% of home carepatients, and 90% of those in nursing homes(GeronurseOnline.org, 2005). A few of thesesettings will be discussed here. Some additionalunique areas of employment are suggested inChapter 23. Because of the nature of the aging process, it is likely that older adults will enter and exit thehealth care system at many different pointsthroughout old age. Figure 1-1 presents the web of health care that often occurs when older adultsenter the system due to illness or accident. Acute Care Hospital The acute care hospital is often the point ofentry to the health care system for older adults.Nurses working in hospitals are likely to care forolder adults even if they do not specialize ingeriatrics, because about half of all patients inthis setting are older. In this setting, geronto-logical nurses focus on treatment and nursingcare of acute problems such as those occurringfrom trauma, accidents, orthopedic injuries, res-piratory ailments, or serious circulatory prob-lems. Any unit (except for maybe labor/delivery/postpartum and pediatrics) in the acute carehospital may serve older adults, so nurses maywork on units that are intensive or rehabilitativein nature, and anything in between. The pur-pose of care will be to assist with survival andprevent complications. Long-Term Care There are many different levels of care that fallunder the long-term care umbrella. These mayinclude assisted living , intermediate care , skilled care , and Alzheimer's units. Facilities that offer these services are generally called byone of several names: nursing homes, long-termcare facilities (LTCFs), skilled nursing facilities(SNFs), retirement homes, assisted living facili-ties, or rehabilitation and health care villages (Figure 1-2) . The places that offer these services may advertise just one or a multitude of levels ofcare. The majority of LTCFs today in the UnitedStates are for-profit or chain-run nursing homes.For this reason, they generally wish to keep theirresidents within their own system. This isaccomplished by first providing independent living apartments, either within a separate unit or in different housing on the property. Olderadults using this service generally care for them-28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 17 18 Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing Table 1-2 Competencies Necessary for Nurses to Provide High- Quality Care to Older Adults and Their Families 1. Recognize one's own and others' attitudes, values, and expectations about aging and their impact on care of older adults and their families. 2. Adopt the concept of individualized care as the standard of practice with older adults.3. Communicate effectively, respectfully, and compassionately with older adults and their families.4. Recognize that sensation and perception in older adults are mediated by functional, physical, cognitive, psychological, and social changes common in old age. 5.

Assess older adults' living environment with special awareness of the functional, physical, cognitive, psychological, and social changes common in old age. 7. Analyze the effectiveness of community resources in assisting older adults and their families to retain personal goals, maximize function, maintain independence, and live in the least restrictiveenvironment. 8. Assess family knowledge of skills necessary to deliver care to older adults.9. Adapt technical skills to meet the functional, physical, cognitive, psychological, social, and endurance capacities of older adults. 10. Individualize care and prevent morbidity and mortality associated with the use of physical and chemical restraints in older adults. 11. Prevent or reduce common risk factors that contribute to functional decline, impaired quality of life, and excess disability in older adults. 12. Establish and follow standards of care to recognize and report elder mistreatment.13. Apply evidence-based standards to screen, immunize, and promote healthy activities in older adults.14. Recognize and manage geriatric syndromes common to older adults.15. Recognize the complex interaction of acute and chronic co-morbid conditions common to older adults. 16.

Facilitate communication as older adults transition across and between home, hospital, and nursing home, with a particular focus on the use of technology. 18. Assist older adults, families, and caregivers to understand and balance \"everyday\" autonomy and safety decisions. 19. Apply ethical and legal principles to the complex issues that arise in care of older adults.20. Appreciate the influence of attitudes, roles, language, culture, race, religion, gender, and lifestyle on how families and assistive personnel provide long-term care to older adults. 21. Evaluate differing international models of geriatric care.22. Analyze the impact of an aging society on the health care system.23. Evaluate the influence of payer systems on access, availability, and affordability of health care for older adults.

Meals are provided every day at acost, of course, and monthly prices vary amongfacilities based on room size and extra services.Older adults pay out of pocket to live in inde-pendent living apartments or centers and thecosts may range greatly, from around $1,800-$6,000 per month. Because these adults do notneed regular nursing care, the opportunity fornurses in this level of care would consist ofdirecting such a facility or perhaps acting as awellness coordinator, though most independentliving centers would not employ a nurse strictlyfor such purposes. Further information aboutindependent living appears later in this chapter.Assisted LivingAs older persons continue to age, it is likely thatcommon disorders associated with the agingprocess may interfere with their ability to care24. Contrast the opportunities and constraints of a supportive living arrangement on the function and independence of older adults and on their families. 25. Recognize the benefits of interdisciplinary team participation in care of older adults.26. Evaluate the utility of complementary and integrative health care practices on health promotion and symptom management for older adults. 27. Facilitate older adults' active participation in all aspects of their own health care.28. Involve, educate, and when appropriate, supervise family, friends, and assistive personnel in implementing best practices for older adults. 29. Ensure quality of care commensurate with older adults' vulnerability and frequency and intensity of care needs. 30. Promote the desirability of quality end-of-life care for older adults, including pain and symptom management, as essential, desirable, and integral components of nursing practice.

Assisted living provides an alter-native for those older adults who do not feel safeliving alone, who wish to live in a communitysetting, or who need some additional help withactivities of daily living (ADLs) . Assisted liv- ing is often connected with a facility or care net-work, generally those that provide long-termcare, though the facility itself may be free-standing and cater exclusively to the assistedliving population. The drawback of this arrange-ment is not only that older adults whose condi-tion degenerates and who need greater assistancefind a cost attached with each extra bit of helpthey need in assisted living, but also that theymay be turned out of the facility when their careneeds become greater, leaving them to findanother institution that provides a higher levelof care. The typical resident in assisted living has a private room or apartment (with a variety ofdesigns available for different costs). All rooms28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 19 20 Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing will have some type of kitchen or kitchenetteand private bathroom with shower. The rest ofthe space includes a bed or bedroom, living area,and sufficient closet space. Older adults whoenter assisted living often sell their homes andplan to spend as long as possible living withminimal assistance. Assisted living facilities generally provide healthy meals, planned activities, places to walkand exercise, and should offer pleasant surround-ings where adults can socialize with others theirown age in a safe and protected environment.Walking paths, aviaries, work-out rooms, beautysalons, community gathering rooms, chapels,and game rooms are part of many assisted livingfacilities. Assisted living facilities may be free-stand- ing or may be part of a larger facility that pro-vides multiple levels of care. For those units thatare part of the large facility, residents who findthemselves in need of progressively greater assis-tance and around-the-clock nursing supervisionmay then enter intermediate care.Intermediate CareThis level of care provides 24-hour per day directnursing contact and may be considered to be theentry level into nursing home care. Intermediatecare units may be named differently dependingupon the facility. Older persons are unable to liveon their own because of a number of factors,including numerous medications to manage,mobility problems, or the presence of chronicdiseases that require an amount of nursing super-vision beyond what a person could manage inde-pendently (like diabetes, severe arthritis,multiple medications, or amputations compli-cated by mobility changes). Some units have res-idents with early Alzheimer's disease in this levelof care. Of course, three meals a day are provided,usually in a common dining area, and a licensednurse (LPN or RN) is in charge of the unit withseveral UAP to assist with ADLs. Therapies suchas physical, occupational, and speech are avail-able and provided as ordered by the physician. Acertain number of beds may be Medicare orMedicaid (see Chapter 16) licensed, with the restprivate pay. As the amount of care requiredincreases, so does the daily or monthly cost.Subacute or Transitional CareSubacute care is generally for patients who require more intensive nursing care than the tra-Table 1-3 AACN Essentials (1998) Core CompetenciesCritical thinkingCommunicationAssessmentTechnical skillsCore KnowledgeHealth promotion, risk reduction, and disease prevention Illness and disease managementInformation and health care technologiesEthicsHuman diversityGlobal health careHealth care systems and policyRole DevelopmentProvider of careDesigner/manager/coordinator of care Member of a profession Source: American Association of Colleges of Nursing (1998).

Frequent patient assess-ments are needed for a limited time period forstabilization or completion of a treatment regi-men. \"Typical individuals seen in subacute careare those needing assistance as a result of non-healing wounds, chronic ventilator dependence,renal problems, intravenous therapy, and comamanagement and those with complex medicaland/or rehabilitative needs, including pediatrics,orthopedics, and neurological. These units aredesigned to promote optimum outcomes in theleast expensive cost setting\" (Easton, 1999,p. 15). Subacute units may found in LTCFs orhospitals. Gerontological nurses working in thissetting would benefit from having a critical carebackground and rehabilitation experience as well.Skilled CareSkilled care units or skilled nursing facilities(SNFs) are for those older adults requiring moreintensive nursing care. Some units are foundwithin nursing homes, others within hospitals.On this unit, one would expect to see personswith tube feedings, IV fluids, multiple medica-tions, chronic wounds, and even ventilators insome cases. The care required is at a higher level,and the higher acuity of the residents or patientsdemands a greater nurse-to-patient ratio. Per-sons in skilled care may include those withFigure 1-1 The \"web\" of health care for the elderly.

A certain number of skilled nursing bedsare licensed by the state, and SNFs must meetmore rigorous requirements than intermediatecare. The gerontological nurse working inskilled care must have expertise in preventingthe hazards of immobility such as pressureulcers and contractures. The skilled care nurseshould have knowledge of transfer techniques,prevention and assessment of swallowing prob-lems, bowel and bladder management, andnutrition. Good assessment and communicationskills are needed to care for these complexpatients.Alzheimer's CareA growing trend in LTCFs today is to offer unitsdedicated to the major phases of Alzheimer'sdisease (AD). Because of the higher incidence ofAD with advanced age, there is a growing needfor units that provide nursing care for elders inthe various stages of dementia that occur withAlzheimer's. Often, family members can care fortheir loved ones at home during the early stages.However, during middle and late stage AD, theolder patient cannot be left alone and showsincreasing signs of deterioration and inability tocare for themselves. As memory loss progresseswith AD, home caregivers often feel over-whelmed and unable to meet the care burdenFigure 1-2 Assisted-living facilities aid older people with Source: \u00a9 Comstock Images/Alamy Images28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 22 required by these patients. Many nursing homesoffer early, middle, and late AD care in order tokeep these patients in the same system. As ADprogresses, so does the level of care required.Alzheimer's units can be a great benefit to thecommunity by having gerontological nursingstaff that has expertise in the management ofthis difficult disease. Nurses can help familymembers understand disease progression andassure them that their loved one is being wellcared for even to the end of the disease, whichresults in death. Having all levels of care at thesame facility makes it easier for patients withAD who have a hard time with new surround-ings, and easier for family members not to haveto change facilities as the disease worsens.HospiceGerontological nurses may also choose to workin hospice , caring for dying persons and their families. Although many patients in hospice arenot elderly, the majority of the dying are older.The concept of hospice is centered around holis-tic, interdisciplinary care that helps the dyingperson \"live until they die\" (see Chapter 22 forfurther discussion). A number of team memberswho specialize in thanatology and palliative carework together to provide quality care forpatients in their last months, weeks, days, andhours of life. Pain management and comfort careare the standards upon which treatment isbased. Nurses and physicians work closely withsocial workers, chaplains, psychologists, andother hospice professionals to make death ascomfortable and as easy a transition as possible. Hospice may appear in a number of facilities. Some hospices are stand-alone organizationswith their own building just dedicated to hos-pice care. Home care often offers hospice, andcertain nursing homes will offer a hospice unitSettings of Care 23 or care within the skilled unit or from an out-side hospice nurse. Clinical nurse specialists pro-vide a great service as expert clinicians andconsultants to the hospice team. Whatever thesetting, hospice requires a great deal of patience,expertise, understanding, interdisciplinary com-munication, and compassion skills on the partof the geriatric nurse. Rehabilitation Rehabilitation may be found in various degreesin several settings, including the acute care hos-pital, subacute or transitional care, and LTCFs.Regardless of the setting, rehabilitation is donethrough the work of an interdisciplinary teamthat includes nurses, therapists, and physiciansas well as other professional staff as needed. Thegoals of rehabilitation are to maximize inde-pendence, promote maximal function, preventcomplications, and promote quality of lifewithin each person's strengths and limitations. The level of intensity of acute rehabilitation is greater than for subacute or long-term care.For older adults to qualify for rehabilitation inthe acute care hospital, they must be able to tol-erate at least 3 hours of therapy per day. Theinterdisciplinary team will work together to setup mutually established goals with the patient.Inpatient rehabilitation in the acute setting isbeneficial to help persons recovering from oradapting to such conditions as stroke, headtrauma, neurological diseases, amputation,orthopedic surgery, and spinal cord injury. Community Many nursing programs are moving towards amore community-based curriculum. This ishelpful for students of gerontological nursing,because most older adults live in the community,with only about 5% at any given time residing28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 23 24 Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing in nursing homes (see Chapter 2 for more statis-tics on the aging population). However, remem-ber that many encounters with older adults willbe as they enter the health care system for illness,whether chronic or acute, so fewer job possibil-ities exist at present in primary and wellness-oriented settings. Within the community, onemay find many different areas for practice, onlya few of which will be discussed here. Home Health CareOlder adults requiring a longer period of obser-vation or care from nurses may be candidates forhome health care services. Visiting nurse associ-ations (VNAs) have long been known for theirpositive reputation in providing home care.Home care is designed for those who are home-bound due to severity of illness or immobility.For reimbursement of allowable expenses, homehealth care services must be ordered by a physi-cian. There has been record growth in the num-ber of home health agencies springing up in thepast decade. People's desire to be cared for infamiliar surroundings by their families, versus aninstitution, has fueled the need for more agencies. Although physical, occupational, and speech therapies may be obtained through home care,as well as home health aide services, a nursemust open the case file and the individual mustwarrant some type of nursing services to qualify.The majority of home care patients are elderlyand experience a variety of problems needingnursing, such as chronic wounds, intravenoustherapy, long-term indwelling urinary catheters,and tube feedings.Foster Care or Group HomesFoster care and/or group homes are for thoseolder adults who can do most of their ADLs,but may have safety issues and require supervi-sion with some activities such as dressing ortaking medications. Foster or group homes gen-erally offer more personalized supervision in a smaller, more family-like environment than atraditional nursing home and should be licensedto provide such services. Some persons offeringthis service have a small number of elders insidetheir existing own home residence, whereas oth-ers have purchased a larger dwelling for thispurpose. This type of setting provides an alter-native to nursing home care for some older per-sons. Although nurses may own and operate agroup home, there is no requirement that a per-son have a health care background to do so, noris there a requirement that a nurse's services beavailable, so persons should take care to inves-tigate the facility prior to placement of a lovedone there. Social workers can usually providegood information about local foster or grouphomes.Independent LivingIndependent living for older adults is often inthe community, but as previously stated, maybe available in many LTCFs. In the communitysetting, independent living arrangements oftentake the form of senior housing, such as withapartment complexes that are exclusively de-voted to the elderly. The accommodations willbe as homelike as possible with kitchens, bath-rooms, living areas, and the like, similar toassisted living. The best form of independentliving\u2014outside of an older person's own home\u2014is one in which the owners and managers havean understanding and appreciation for theneeds and capabilities of the elderly adult. Suchliving situations generally make accommoda-tions for those in their later years with addi-tions such as extra handrails, nonslip flooring,adequate elevators, facility security systems,and friendly room layouts larger bath-rooms and emergency call buttons. Senior28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 24 Settings of Care 25 housing complexes that promote independentliving often provide between 1 and 3 meals perday in a common dining area and provide largerooms to entertain guests for parties and fam-ily gatherings. An activity director may planoutings, with transportation provided. Doctorsoffering special services such as podiatric caremay make regular visits to the facility and setup a clinic for the day. Nurses working in thissetting may focus on primary prevention, thatis, health promotion/disease prevention activi-ties such as educational programs. Overall,independent living is an excellent alternativefor older adults who feel more comfortable in asafe, supervised surrounding that is less iso-lated than living alone in their own home, butstill allows them complete independence inADLs and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) . Adult Day CareAdult day care or day services provide yetanother avenue for older adults who are unableto remain at home during the day withoutsupervision. Usually these services are used byfamily members who are caring for older par-ents or loved ones in their own home, but whomay work during the day and wish to havetheir relative safely cared for in their absence.This is an excellent alternative to institution-alization. \"Adult day services are community-based group programs designed to meet theneeds of functionally and/or cognitivelyimpaired adults through an individual plan ofcare. These structured, comprehensive pro-grams provide a variety of health, social, andother related support services in a protectivesetting during any part of a day, but less than24-hour care\" (National Adult Day ServicesAssociation, 2005). Adult day care programs may be sponsored by a variety of different organizations includingBox 1-3 Research Highlight Aim: This study described the meaning of caring for geriatric nurses. Methods: Parse's phenomenology was used to survey 30 nurses in Taiwan whoworked on medical-surgical units car-ing for older adults. The nurses wereasked open-ended questions about themeaning of caring in providing care tothe elderly. Findings: The researcher concluded that, for geriatric nurses, the meaning of car-ing included several concepts: delibera-tion, concern, tolerance, sincerity,empathy, initiative, and dedication. Theauthor suggests that caring for the elderlyshould be natural and not superficial inorder for the elderly to feel cared for. Conclusion: Geriatric nurses in this study demonstrated the meaning of caring inseveral distinct ways. Core moral andethical values appeared in their descrip-tions of the meaning of caring for olderadults. Nurses may improve their careof older adults by attending to thesecore concepts related to caring. Geron-tological nursing education may benefitby including more about caring theory.

Centers provide socialization,planned outings, nutritional meals, and thera-peutic activities that would appeal to olderadults with moderate physical and/or mental28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 25 26 Chapter 1: Introduction to Gerontological Nursing decline. All functions are supervised by quali-fied personnel. Services are offered only duringthe day, often from 6 a.m.-6 p.m. (or normalbusiness hours) with an emphasis on recreationand some health promotion. Some programsoffer weekend hours. Costs vary depending onthe sponsoring agency. Summary In conclusion, our attitudes about aging andcaring for the elderly are influenced by manyfactors. Because of the changing population, allnurses need to have basic competence in the careof older adults. Gerontological nursing practiceis guided by standards and core competencies.The scope of practice may be expanded with for-mal advanced education, and certification at anylevel is a way to demonstrate expertise. There are many settings in which the geron- tological nurse may practice. Additionally, thereare emerging subfields of gerontology thatoffer promise for new future roles for nursesthat care for the elderly. Nurses should explorethe various career options open to them in thisfield.Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Do this exercise with another student as a partner. Close your eyes. Picture yourself as an 85-year-old. Note your appearance, sights, sounds, and surroundings. Open your eyesand describe yourself at 85 to your partner. Then discuss how your mental image of your-self as an older person might have been influenced by your family history, grandparents,and perceptions about aging. 2. Go to a local card shop and browse. Look at the birthday cards that persons might buy for someone getting older. What do they say about society's attitudes towards aging? Do thecards you read point out any areas that we stereotype as problems with advancing age? 3. Complete this sentence: Older people are . . . List as many adjectives as you can think of. After making your list, identify how many are negative and how many are positive descriptors. Think about where your ideas camefrom as you did this exercise. 4. Check out the Web site at www.geronurseonline.com. How could you use this Web site to enhance your knowledge about the care of older adults? What services are availablethrough the Web site? 5. Look at the list of competencies for gerontological nurses in Table 1-2. How many of these competencies do you feel you meet at this point? Make a conscious effort to developthese skills as you go through your career. 6. Visit a local nursing home that offers various levels of care. Call ahead of time to arrange a tour from a nurse and ask questions about the services they offer to older adults.28438_CH01_001_028.qxd 6/6/06 4:31 PM Page 26 Glossary 27 Activities of daily living (ADLs): Include bathing, dressing, grooming, showering, and toiletingactivities.

A steadily growingaging population has the potential to affect socialpolicy, societal resources, businesses, and com-munities, not to mention health care systems. The Numbers Since 1900, the U.S. population has tripled, butthe number of older adults, those over age 65,has increased 11-fold (MIAH, CDC, & GSA,2004). The older population in the United States28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 29 30 Chapter 2: The Aging Population grew from 3 million to 36 million in the 20thcentury alone. Just over 12% (36 million) of thepopulation in the United States was 65 or olderin 2000 (Munnell, 2004; U.S. Census Bureau,2001). Of this population,18.4 million (53%)were aged 65-74. In the 2000 census, there were12.4 million 74- to 85-year-olds (35% of theolder population). And the number of oldest old, those people 85 years of age or older, grew from 100,000 in 1900 to 4.2 million in 2000(Federal Interagency Forum, 2004; U.S. CensusBureau, 2001). By the mid-twenty-first century,old people will outnumber young people for thefirst time in history (Winokur, 2005). Why the Recent Increase in theNumber of Older Adults? It is expected that, by 2025, the number of per-sons 65 and older in the United States willincrease from 12% of the population (in the year2000) to 19% (Munnell, 2004). The recenttrend of increasing numbers of older adults inthe United States is due to two main causes: theincreased life expectancy of our seniors and thefertility of the U.S. population at various pointsin time. In 1935, when Social Security was enacted, the life expectancy for persons age 65 was 12years for males (or 77 years total) and 13 yearsfor females (or 78 years total). This has risen to16 and 19 years, respectively. By 2080, lifeexpectancy for 65-year-olds is expected to haveincreased to 20 years and 23 years, respectively(Munnell, 2004). There is less of a racial differ-ence in life expectancy than in other parametersof aging. In 2001, life expectancy at birth was5.5 years higher for whites than for blacks, butat age 65, whites could expect to live for 2 yearslonger than blacks. For those who live to age 85,the life expectancy for black people is slightlyhigher than for whites (Federal InteragencyForum, 2004). Changes in life expectancy throughout the 20th century were mainly due to improved san-itation, advances in medical care, and the imple-mentation of preventive health services (MIAH,CDC, & GSA, 2004). In the early 1900s, deathswere mostly due to infectious diseases and acuteillnesses. The older population of today, how-ever, must deal with challenges unfamiliar totheir own parents. These are the challenges ofdealing with chronic disease as well funding for health care services. The average 75-year-oldnow has three chronic diseases and uses five pre-scription drugs (MIAH, CDC, & GSA, 2004).Modern treatments for diseases that used to killolder adults, such as myocardial infarction andstroke, as well as the improved technical proce-dures for health services such as transplants andintensive care, have contributed to the increasedlongevity of the population. Health care costs, including medication costs, have thus become a primary issue formany seniors . The repercussions of rising health care costs have been felt within the stateand federal governments, as they seek to helpsupport their senior citizens' health. Nearly95% of health care expenditures for olderAmericans are for chronic diseases (MIAH,CDC, & GSA, 2004). Fertility of the population also affects the number of older adults. The fertility rate in the United States has been steadily falling forthe past 200 years. In 1800, the average womanhad 7 children. By the end of World War II, thishad decreased to 2.4 children. But after the war,from 1946 to 1964, the fertility rate increasedto 3.5 children (Munnell, 2004). Of course, onecould argue that some of these changes have less28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 30 The Numbers 31 to do with fertility rate and more to do with theinfluence of other factors such as the acceptanceand use of birth control as well as the changingvalues of different generations. The current issuein aging has to do with the baby boomers . This extremely large segment of the Americanpopulation, who were born between 1946 and1964, will start turning 65 in 2011. Because ofthe number of baby boomers, the number ofolder adults will increase dramatically between2010 and 2030. This anticipated increase hasalternatively been called a demographic tidal wave (MIAH, CDC, & GSA, 2004) or a pig in a python (Munnell, 2004). Beginning in 2012, nearly 10,000 Ameri- cans will turn 65 every day (MIAH, CDC, &GSA, 2004). By 2030, the older population willcomprise 20% of the total population of theUnited States (which will be about 70 millionpeople) (Federal Interagency Forum, 2004;MIAH, CDC, & GSA, 2004). This group ofolder adults will be the \"healthiest, longestlived, best educated, most affluent in history\"(Experience Corps, 2005). After 2030, the pop-ulation of oldest old (those over 85 years) willgrow the fastest. According to the FederalInteragency Forum (2004), the U.S. CensusBureau projects that the population of those 85and older could grow from 4.2 million in 2000to 21 million by 2050 (see Figure 2-1 ). The Distribution of Seniors inthe United States The distribution of older Americans variesacross the United States, due in part to patternsof migration after retirement. It is also due tobirth and death rates in the various states andregions. For instance, in 2002, Florida (17%),Pennsylvania (15%), and West Virginia (15%)had the highest numbers of persons 65 and older(Federal Interagency Forum, 2004). Between1990 and 2000, the West and South regionsgrew the fastest. This growth ranged from a 1%increase in seniors in Rhode Island to a 72%increase in Nevada. The other states with fastgrowing senior populations included Alaska(60% increase), Arizona (39%), and NewMexico (30%). The District of Columbia wasthe only area to show a decline in the 65-and-older group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Although every state showed growth in the numbers of seniors, in many areas seniors repre-sented a smaller proportion of the population.In the Midwest, the proportion of persons 65and older declined from 13% in 1990 to 12.8%in 2000. Similar declines in proportion wereseen nationwide (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Issues of Gender Women outnumber men in the United States, atrend that is expected to continue. In 2003, 58%of the population was female. In the 85 and olderage group, women accounted for 69% of thepopulation (Federal Interagency Forum, 2004).In fact, the age groups 65-74 and 85 and olderhad nearly 2 million more women than men, andthe 75-84 age group had nearly 3 million morewomen (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). In 2000, the sex ratio for the general U.S. population was 96 males for every 100 females.This ratio declines steadily with age. For persons65-74 it was 82:100; for those 85 and older, itwas 41:100 (or more than two women for everyman) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). In 2003, over 75% of men ages 65-74 were married, compared to 56% of women in thesame age group. Only 36% of women ages75-84 were married; this dropped to 14% inthe 85 and older age group. For men 85 and28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 31 32 Chapter 2: The Aging Population older, 59% were married. Women age 65 andolder were three times as likely as men of thesame age to be widowed, 44% compared to14%. In 2003, 78% of women age 85 and olderwere widowed, compared to 35% of men age 85and older. Divorce is more unusual in this agegroup. In 2003, 7% of older men and 9% ofolder women were divorced. A smaller propor-tion of older adults had never been married(Federal Interagency Forum, 2004).Education The level of education can affect the socioeco-nomic status of the older adult ( Figure 2-2 ). Those with more education tend to have moremoney, higher standards of living, and above-average health. The comparisons over the yearsare interesting. In 1950, 17% of the older adultsin the United States had graduated from highschool, and 3% had at least a bachelor's degree.Figure 2-1 Real and projected numbers of people 65 /H11001in the United States, 1900-2050. 90100 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1910 1900 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050Millions Projected45 and over 85 and over Note: Data for 2010-2050 are projections of the population.Reference population: These data refer to the resident population.Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and Projections.Number of people age 65 and over, by age group, selected years 1900-2000and projected 2010-2050 Source: Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics.

Differencesalso exist in education between ethnic groups. In2003, 76% of older non-Hispanic whites, 70%of older Asians, 52% of older blacks, and 36% ofolder Hispanics had completed high school. Alsoin 2003, 29% of older Asians, 20% of non-Hispanic whites, 10% of older blacks, and 6% ofolder Hispanics had at least a bachelor's degree(Federal Interagency Forum, 2004).Living Arrangements Living arrangements of older adults are linkednot only to income, but also to health status.Older people who live alone are more likely thantheir married counterparts to live in poverty. In2003, older men were more likely to be livingwith a spouse than were older women (73%compared to 50%; see Figure 2-3 ). Older women were twice as likely as older men to beliving alone (40% compared to 19%). Livingarrangements, like education, also varied by raceFigure 2-2 Sources of income for persons 65 /H11001.

Older Asian men were morelikely than other races and ethnicities to livewith relatives other than a spouse. The state ofliving alone increases as age increases. Olderpeople who lived alone had higher poverty ratesthan those who lived with their spouse. In 2002,16% of older men and 21% of older womenwho lived alone lived in poverty. Only 5% ofolder married men and women lived in poverty(Federal Interagency Forum, 2004). Effects of Ethnicity The growing aging population consists of a sig-nificantly increased proportion of minorities.Minority elders will make up 22% of the elderlypopulation over the next 20 years (Ross, 2000).The diversity as well as the vast increase innumber of this group provides a distinct chal-lenge in meeting health care needs.

An understandingof cultural diversity and the unique challengesit poses is needed to address health issues andpromote wellness. The older population in the United States is growing more racially and ethnically diverse asit ages. In 2003, 83% of U.S. older adults werenon-Hispanic whites, 8% of the older popula-tion was black, 3% Asian, and 6% Hispanic (seeTable 2-1 ). By 2050, projections are that this will change to 61% non-Hispanic white, 18%Hispanic, 12% black, and 8% Asian. The olderHispanic population is projected to grow thefastest, from 2 million in 2003 to 15 million in2050, and to be larger than the older black pop-ulation by 2028. The older Asian population isalso projected to increase, from 1 million in2003 to 7 million in 2050 (Federal InteragencyForum, 2004).African AmericansAfrican American elders make up the largestcultural minority and are projected to increasefrom 8% to 12% of the older population by2050. Currently, 26.5% of African Americanelders live in poverty compared to 8.2% of el-derly whites. In fact, in 1998, divorced blackwomen ages 65 to 74 had a poverty rate of 47%,Questions 1.

There is also a great disparity in networth between black and white householdsheaded by older Americans. In 1999, net worthamong older black households was estimated tobe $13,000, compared to $181,000 amongolder white households (Administration onAging, 2000). The lack of economic resourcesand poor access to health care add to theincreased incidence of disease with greater com-plications in this subgroup. Higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease are seen in AfricanAmericans (Ross, 2000). African Americans aretwice as likely as whites to have diabetes(Illinois Department on Aging, 2001). AfricanAmerican men have higher incidences of lungand prostate cancer as compared to whites.African Americans' overall risk to develop kid-ney disease is highest of the senior groups.Nutritional intake plays a large part in thesediseases. Kumanyika (1997) notes that high-fat,low-fiber diets cause or aggravate these illnesses.Physical activity levels are lower among lesseducated older Americans, both white andAfrican American. African Americans often do not use routine preventive services at recommended rates andare less likely to have a regular provider ofhealth care, opting instead for hospital outpa-tient departments, historically known for longwaits and inconsistent providers (Markides &Miranda, 1997). The top five causes of deathamong African Americans are heart disease, can-cer, stroke, diabetes, and pneumonia/influenza(Sahyoun, 2001). From these statistics, it is evi-dent that preventive services have the potentialto affect the longevity of this population.HispanicsThe Hispanic population is the second largestand most rapidly growing ethnic minority inthe United States (Hazuda & Espino, 1997).The over-65-year-old Hispanic population is theTable 2-1 U.S. Population Age 65 /H11001by Race and Hispanic Origin, 2000 Total 65 /H11001 Numbers Percent Non-Hispanic Black 1) 100-Percent DataSource: www.aoa.gov/prof/Statistics/minority_aging/facts_minority_aging.asp28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 36 The Numbers 37 fastest growing segment of the total U.S. pop-ulation. By 2050, Hispanic elderly will make up16.4% of all U.S. elderly, adding up to 13.4million Hispanics over the age of 65 (Adminis-tration on Aging, 2000). The Hispanic popu-lation in the United States consists of a diversepopulation from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, theDominican Republic, and other countries ofCentral and South America. The poverty rate in2001 for Hispanic elderly in the United Stateswas more than twice that of the total older pop-ulation (Administration on Aging, 2003). The chronic diseases of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and cerebrovascular disease areseen in significant numbers in the Hispanicpopulation. Centers for Disease Control (CDC)data show Hispanics are less likely to obtainpreventive services such as flu and pneumoniavaccines and mammograms as compared towhites (Ross, 2000). The age-adjusted rate ofdiabetes in this population is 44% higher thanfor non-Hispanic whites (Administration onAging, 2003). Hispanics also have higher ratesof cervical, esophageal, gallbladder, and stom-ach cancer as compared to whites. Poverty lev-els, only slightly lower than African Americanelderly, and language barriers are often impedi-ments to accessing health care coverage andhealth care services (Ross, 2000). The top fivecauses of death among Hispanics are heart dis-ease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD), and pneumonia/influenza (Sahyoun, 2001). In 2002, 72% of Hispanics age 60 and over lived in four states: California, Florida, NewYork, and Texas (Administration on Aging,2003). Hispanics in general receive assistance inthe home when functionally declining, versus inlong-term facilities (Angel & Angel, 1997).Family members frequently act as their care-givers, and multigenerational families under oneroof are common. On average, Hispanic familiesand households are larger than non-Hispanicfamilies and households (Aranda & Miranda,1997). Overall, the percentage of Hispanic el-derly living alone is lower than that of the gen-eral population (Administration on Aging,2003). Older Hispanics are more likely to bemarried and to rely on family over friends whencompared to white elderly. Asians and Pacific IslandersThis subgroup actually is composed of 40 dif-ferent ethnic groups with various economic,educational, and health profiles (Ross, 2000).Some identified ethnicities include Asian,Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Pacific Islander, andHawaiian. National data, however, do not nec-essarily discern between ethnicities, which com-plicates identifying demographics and patternsfor each culture. The Asian American andPacific Islander population has been the fastestgrowing racial/ethnic group in the UnitedStates recently, having increased 141% between1970 and 1980 and 99% between 1980 and1990 (Elo, 1997). According to the U.S. Bureauof the Census, projections for the years2000-2050 include population increases forAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders from2.4% to 6.5% of the U.S. population(Administration on Aging, 2000). Life expectancy data have historically shown an advantage for the Asian American and PacificIslander population. Census data from 1995showed life expectancy at birth of AsianAmericans and Pacific Islanders to be 79.3 yearsfor males and 84.9 years for females, as comparedto 73.6 and 80.1 for white males and females,respectively. Elo (1997) questions inconsistenciesin the data due to the heterogeneity of the group.28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 37 38 Chapter 2: The Aging Population The evaluation of mortality data did placeChinese, Japanese, and Filipinos well below whiteAmericans. As a whole, cancer and heart diseasecontribute less to all-cause mortality in the AsianAmerican and Pacific Islander population than inwhites. Cerebrovascular disease, however, is amore prominent cause of death for some sub-groups of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders(Elo, 1997). Discrepancies are seen in mortalitycauses depending on whether persons are nativeor foreign-born, pointing to the impact of accul-turation in U.S. society. But overall, the top fivecauses of death among Asian Americans or PacificIslanders are heart disease, cancer, stroke, pneu-monia/influenza, and COPD (Sahyoun, 2001). Kitano, Tazuko, and Kitano (1997) note the inconsistency of this minority group's use ofcommunity professional resources. Dependenceon familial and informal ethnic resources is seenmore often. Length of the family's time in thiscountry (recent arrival vs. present a century)impacts comfort and ease of resource use. Healthcare providers will need to address not only thediversity within this minority group, but alsothe time or extent of acculturation and assimi-lation within each subgroup.American Indians and Alaskan NativesThe category of American Indians and AlaskanNatives represents 500 nations, tribes, bands,and native villages in which 150 languages areused (Kramer, 1997). Although the AmericanIndians and Alaskan Natives make up a smallpercentage of the nation's elderly, they are oneof the fastest growing groups of minority el-derly, behind Asian and Hispanic groups (Cha-pleski, 1997). American Indians and AlaskanNatives over the age of 60 were 152,000 innumber per the 2000 census (Administration onAging, 2000). The over-75 years of age cohortof American Indians and Alaskan Natives isexpected to double by the year 2050 (Cha-pleski). Two thirds of American Indian andAlaskan Native elders live in 10 states.Historical and political developments forced theconcentration of American Indians first ontoreservations west of the Mississippi and then tomore urban areas (Chapleski). Due to these relo-cation efforts, American Indians and AlaskanNatives are not necessarily in close proximity toIndian Health Services (IHS) facilities. Only59% of this population actually lives in IHSareas (Chapleski). Although the majority ofAmerican Indians and Alaskan Natives live inrural areas, many have moved to urban areas. Chronic disease prevalence in American Indians and Alaskan Natives increased signifi-cantly in the 20th century. The IHS madetremendous efforts to increase life expectancyfrom 51 years in 1940 to 71 years in 1980through a reduction in infectious disease. Now,however, there is a tremendous prevalence ofchronic disease due to dietary changes, sedentarylifestyles, and technology that is similar toWestern society (Kramer, 1997). The leadingcauses of death for older American Indians andAlaskan Natives are heart disease, cancer, dia-betes, stroke, and COPD (Sahyoun, 2001). Diabetes is a serious threat to morbidity and mortality in the American Indian and AlaskanNative population. They are 2.5 times morelikely to get diabetes as compared to same-agewhites (Ross, 2000). Complications of diabetesare also seen more frequently, with end-stagerenal disease occurring 6.8 times more inAmerican Indians and the number of nontrau-matic lower extremity amputations far exceed-ing non-American Indian populations (Kramer,1997). These high rates of disease and compli-cations are seen in younger age cohorts as well. 28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 38 The Numbers 39 Heart disease is the leading cause of death among American Indians and Alaskan Nativesdue to a rise in risk factors (obesity, diabetes,smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, andsedentary lifestyle) (Kramer, 1997). YoungerAmerican Indians (in their 40s) experience athree to four times greater cardiovascular mor-tality than the general population. Hyperten-sion prevalence in general is low, but whencoupled with obesity and diabetes, long-termeffects are devastating\u2014end stage retinopathy, cerebrovascular dis-ease, and myocardial infarction (Kramer, 1997).Rheumatoid arthritis is seen in higher rates inAmerican Indians as compared to AlaskanNatives and whites, with individual Indiantribes affected in larger numbers. Cancer is thethird leading cause of death of AmericanIndians. Survival rates are the lowest comparedto any other U.S. population (Kramer, 1997).Lung cancer is most common. The National Indian Council on Aging study of 1981 noted the health, functional, and socialstatus of American Indian elders (Kramer,1997). It was noted that 45-year-olds on reser-vations and 55-year-olds in urban areas wereconsidered elders and matched criteria of whiteAmericans at age 65 (Kramer). This shifts thenecessity for health interventions and diseasemanagement to occur at a much younger age toimpact the significant mortality and morbidityin the American Indian and Alaskan Nativepopulation. Other Minorities The Older Foreign-Born Population inthe United StatesThe foreign-born are people who are living in the United States who were not U.S. citizens atbirth. As of 2000, the 65 /H11001-year-old foreign- born population in the United States numbered3.1 million. More than one third of U.S. foreign-born immigrants are from Europe, a patternthat will change in the future according toimmigration laws and world events. It is ex-pected that, in the future, the older foreign-bornwill be more likely to come from Latin Americaor Asia (He, 2000). Nearly 66% of the older foreign-born in the United States have lived here for more than 30years. The older foreign-born are also twice aslikely to be naturalized citizens as the foreign-born of all ages (see Table 2-2 ). Almost 50% of the older foreign-born have not completed highschool (compared to 29% of native-born olderAmericans). Older foreign-born are more likelythan native-born elders to live in family house- holds, and their poverty rate is also higher thanthe native-born U.S. citizens. They are also lesslikely to have health coverage (He, 2000).U.S. VeteransChanges in the population of older Americanswho are veterans of the armed services are alsoexpected as the Vietnam-era cohort ages. In2000, there were 9.8 million veterans age 65and older in the United States\u2014two of everythree men 65 and older were veterans. Morethan 95% of these veterans are male. Between1990 and 2000, the number of male veteransage 85 and older increased from 142,000 to400,000 ( Figure 2-4 ). There is a projected increase after 2010 as the Vietnam-era cohortages. The number of veterans 85 and older isexpected to increase steadily to a peak of 1.4million in 2012 (Federal Interagency Forum,2004). This increase in the number of veteranswill challenge the U.S. Department of Veteran'sAffairs, which has traditionally supplied a major28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 39 40 Chapter 2: The Aging PopulationTable 2-2 Age and Sex of the Population Aged 65 and Over by Citizenship Status: March 2000 (Numbers in thousands) Nativity/Citizenship Total Native Foreign Born Naturalized Citizen Not a Citizen Number Percent Number Percent Number Percent 54.3 1,778 57.1 1,195 54.6 older 14,825 45.4 13,488 45.7 1,337 42.9 992 58.0 7,251 57.8 799 59.3 543 56.4 256 66.7 75 years and older 5,837 42.0 5,289 42.2 548 40.7 420 years 4,796 34.5 4,390 35.0 406 30.1 299 31.0 107 27.9 /H1100285 years and older 1,041 7.5 899 7.2 142 10.5 121 12.6 21 5.5 Total 51.7 979 55.4 652 559 31.6 396 32.3 163 29.9 /H1100285 years and older 2,099 11.2 1,868 11.0 231 13.0 176 14.4 54 10.0 Source: U.S. Census Bureau.

These includethose traumatically injured as well as those bornwith disability. Traumatically injured persons are now more likely to received expert emergency services atthe time of their accident. Advances in intensivecare services, surgical services, diagnostic ser-vices, and the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers have combined to prolong the livesof persons who used to die within days ormonths of their traumatic injuries. For the firsttime in history, persons with spinal cord injuriesand brain injuries are living to become elderly.They are truly entering a time in their life thatis unpredictable, because they are the first toreach these advanced ages. Unforeseen effects ofaging in persons with spinal cord injury, forexample, include shoulder injury (from repeti-tive movements related to wheelchair mobility)and increased risk of pressure ulcers. Developmentally disabled individuals are another special aging group. Technologicaladvances and improvements in health care areFigure 2-4 Male veterans 65 /H11001, 1990-2000.

Twelve percent ofpersons with developmental disabilities are now65 and older. This translates to between200,000 and 500,000 people. There are greatimplications for the U.S. health care system asthis population continues to age, grow, andoutlive their parents. Unforeseen secondaryhealth problems are beginning to be seen inthis older population, including obesity,chronic skin problems, and early aging(Connolly, 1998). Elderly InmatesOne oft-forgotten segment of the elderly popu-lation in the United States is the prisoners.There are more than 55,000 inmates over theage of 55 in the United States and even more aregrowing old. It is anticipated that the numberof inmates over age 55 could double every 5years (Winokur, 2005). Bureau of Justice statis-tics note that in 2003 there were 208 maleinmates age 55 or over per 100,000 U.S. popu-lation. Females 55 /H11001accounted for 8 per100,000. In 2003, inmates 55 /H11001accounted for 5.9% of the federal prison population. Elderly even has a different connotation in the world of jail cells. Due to the stresses ofprison life and the earlier onset of age-relatedproblems, \"elderly\" begins at age 50 or evenearlier for those in prison (Schreiber, 1999). A50-year-old inmate may have a physiologicalage that is 10-15 years older than his biologi-cal age, due to the use of illicit drugs, alcoholintake, and limited access to preventive careand health services. It can cost three times asmuch money to care for an older inmate, com-pared to a younger one. Inmates age 55 andolder tend to have at least three chronic condi-tions, and up to 20% have a mental illness(Mitka, 2004). Aged inmates can require suchcomplicated and costly procedures as dialysisthree times weekly, special diets, and expensivemedications. Adaptive equipment, such aswalkers and wheelchairs, may also be needed formobility. In 2003 in Texas, 1,159 inmates overthe age of 65 required 24-hour skilled nursingcare (McMahon, 2003). plete your admission assessment andtalk to him about the plans for his care.Questions: 1.

Due to these legal rights, and the expand-ing aging prison population, combined withtight federal and state budgets, it is no wonderthat some think that the U.S. prison system isoverdue for a health care crisis (Mitka, 2004).Some states, like Texas, have developed separatefacilities for their geriatric prisoners. Others haveintegrated telemedicine into their facilities ordeveloped chronic care clinics. And some, recog-nizing the likelihood of inmates not only agingin place in prison but also dying of chronic dis-ease while in prison, have implemented hospiceprograms for their dying, elderly prisoners. Mortality and Morbidity Causes of Death The leading cause of death for older adults in2001 was diseases of the heart, followed bymalignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases,chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza andpneumonia, and diabetes. Death rates for diseasesof the heart and cerebrovascular disease decreasedby one third from 1981 to 2001. Age-adjusteddeath rates for diabetes mellitus increased by43% from 1981 to 2001, and death rates forchronic lower respiratory diseases increased by62% during the same time period. Diseases of theheart and malignant neoplasms are the top twocauses of death for people age 65 and older in theUnited States, regardless of race, gender, or eth-nic origin. Race and ethnicity do play a part inother causes of death, however. In 2001, diabetesmellitus was the fifth leading case of deathamong black men, the fourth among Hispanicmen, and the sixth among white men and men ofAsian or Pacific Islander origin. For women age65 and older, diabetes mellitus was the fourthleading cause of death for Hispanics and blacks,and the seventh leading cause of death amongwhites (Federal Interagency Forum, 2004). Chronic Diseases The prevalence of chronic diseases increases withage. Four of the six leading causes of death Questions: 1. How should you focus your phys- ical assessment? 2. What chronic diseases might Mr. Crow be at high risk for? 3. What are the implications for his family? 4.

He lives ona reservation in Oklahoma with hiswife and three teenaged children. Mr.Crow came to the health clinic for aroutine checkup. You note that he isoverweight.Case Study 2-328438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 43 44 Chapter 2: The Aging Population among older Americans are chronic diseasessuch as heart disease, stroke, cancer and dia-betes. Older women report higher numbers ofchronic diseases such as hypertension, asthma,chronic bronchitis, and arthritis, whereas menreport more heart disease, cancer, diabetes, andemphysema. Ethnic and racial differences alsoexist in the prevalence of chronic diseases. Olderblacks report higher levels of hypertension anddiabetes than non-Hispanic whites, whereasHispanics report higher levels of diabetes thannon-Hispanic whites. Both diabetes and hyper-tension are increasing among older Americans(Federal Interagency Forum, 2004). Sensory impairments and oral health prob- lems become more frequent with aging. Earlydetection can prevent or postpone the physical,social, and emotional effects that these changeshave on a senior's life. In 2002, nearly 50% ofolder men and nearly 33% of older womenreported difficulty with hearing. Those age 85and older reported more difficulty than those65-74. Vision trouble affects about 18% ofolder adults. In 2002, of those people 65 andover who reported trouble with vision, 16%reported ever having glaucoma, 16% reportedever having macular degeneration, and 44%reported having cataracts in the past 12 months.Thirty-eight percent of persons 85 years of ageor older reported edentulism (lack of teeth).Poorer older adults were less likely to have teeththan those above the poverty threshold (46%compared to 27%) (Federal Interagency Forum,2004). Glasses, hearing aids, and dentures canbe difficult to obtain for financial reasons: Theyare expensive and they are not covered servicesunder Medicare. Thus, many older adults maynot possess these assistive devices, or may haveout-of-date or ill-fitting devices, which canaffect cognitive status (hearing aids and glasses),nutritional intake (dentures), and likelihood offalling (glasses). Memory loss is not unusual in the older adult. Older men are more likely to experiencemoderate or severe memory impairment thanolder women. In 2002, 15% of men age 65 orolder and 11% of women of the same age expe-rienced moderate to severe memory impair-ment. At age 85 or older, nearly 33% of bothwomen and men suffered from this impairment.In 2002, the proportion of people age 85 orolder with moderate or severe memory impair-ment was 32% compared to 5% of people ages65-69 (Federal Interagency Forum, 2004). Many people feel that older age is highly cor- related with disability. The age-adjusted pro-portion of people in the United States age 65and older with chronic disabilities actuallydeclined from 1984 to 1999. Due to the popu-lation growth, however, the actual numbers ofolder persons with chronic disabilities increasedfrom 6.2 million in 1984 to 6.8 million in1999. Older women reported more difficultiesin physical functioning than older men. In2002, 31% of older women reported that theywere unable to perform at least one of five activ-ities, compared to 18% of men (see Figure 2-5 ). Those age 85 or older had more physical limi-tations than those 65-74. Physical functioningis also somewhat related to race and ethnicity.Seventeen percent of non-Hispanic white maleswere unable to perform at least one physicalactivity, compared to 26% of non-Hispanicblacks and 22% of Hispanics. For women, 30%of non-Hispanic whites were unable to performat least one activity, compared to 36% of non-Hispanic blacks and 29% of Hispanics (FederalInteragency Forum, 2004).28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 44 Mortality and Morbidity 45 Good Health in Aging? Feeling depressed about aging and the aged?Although the statistics can sound grim, in actu-ality, aging is enjoyed by the vast majority ofseniors. More than 72% of seniors report havinggood to excellent health (see Figure 2-6 and Table 2-3 ). The number of seniors living innursing homes declined from 5.2% in 1990 to4.5% in 2000. Only 18.2% of those age 85 andolder lived in nursing homes in 2000, comparedto 24.5% in 1990. In 2000, 1 out of every 5,578people was 100 years of age or older (U.S. CensusBureau, 2001). Older adults in the United Statesare, by and large, active and healthy. Figure 2-5 Medicare enrollees with limited function, 1991 and 2002.

From 1650 to1850, older Americans made up less than 2% ofthe population (Fleming, Evans, & Chutka,2003). Old age in those times was considered tostart at 60 years of age. In colonial times, elderswere greatly respected. They were given the bestseats in church. Puritans taught youth how tobehave toward their elders (Egendorf, 2002). By1870, older adults made up 3% of the U.S. pop-ulation, and only 0.37% were over the age of 80.Some older adults lived with nuclear familiesand were treated with great respect. Among theupper classes, the older adults tended to controlthe family's land and wealth, thus maintainingauthority over the family. Poor people in thosetimes often did not live to old age\u2014old age wasa privilege of the rich. The elderly poor wereseen as a burden on society, so if old age wasattained by a poor person, it was accompaniedby derision and scorn from other citizens(Fleming, Evans, & Chutka, 2003). Youth came to be increasingly valued dur- ing the American Revolution. Older adultsFigure 2-6 Persons 65 /H11001reporting good to excellent health, 2000-2002.

Fashion favored a youthfullook, and clothing flattered the youngerframe. Claimed ages in the census drifteddownward, because people did not want toacknowledge their actual age. Terms such as\"old fogey,\" \"codger,\" and \"geezer\" came intobeing. Retirement from public office becamemandatory at age 60 or 70 in many states(Egendorf, 2002; Fleming, Evans, & Chutka,2003). By the end of the 19th century, age stratifi- cation was prevalent in American life. Activitieslike school attendance, marriage, and retirementbecame based on age. By the start of the 20thcentury there were increasing numbers of olderadults. Cultural focus shifted to business, med-icine, and scientific advances. Older adults weredevalued (Fleming, Evans, & Chutka, 2003). Throughout history, old age has often been associated with lack of income and dependencyon others. Poverty was greater in the southernstates, especially among widows and blacks.Immigrants and blacks were the least preparedfor the lack of income after retirement. Here isa quote from a former slave: When my mother became old, she was sent to live in a lonely log-hut in the woods. Aged andworn out slaves, whether men or women, arecommonly so treated. No care is taken of them,except, perhaps, that a little ground is clearedabout the hut, on which the old slave, if able,may raise a little corn. As far as the owner isconcerned, they live or die as it happens; it isjust the same thing as turning out an old horse.(Fleming, Evans, & Chutka, 2003)Table 2-3 Persons 65 /H11001Reporting Good to Excellent Health, 1994-1996Percentage of Persons Age 65 or Older Who Reported Good to Excellent Health, By Age Group, Sex, and Race and Hispanic Origin, 1994 to 1996 Non-Hispanic Non-Hispanic All Persons White Black Hispanic Total65 or Older 72.2 74.0 58.4 64.9Men65 74.3 57.8 64.665 to 74 75.2 77.5 59.3 68.575 to 84 69.8 71.7 55.3 59.3 85 or Older 65.1 66.4 56.0 55.1 Note: Data are based on a 3-year average from 1994 to 1996.

I knewan old woman, who for seventy years faithfullyserved her master. She had become almost help-less, from hard labor and disease. Her ownersmoved to Alabama, and the old black womanwas left to be sold to any body who would givetwenty dollars for her.There were no national or state social sup- ports for the poor in early America. Rather, thetownships assisted the poor. In some communi-ties, the rising taxes needed for relief of the poorled the communities to rid themselves of thepoor by auctioning them off to farms for labor.Some communities even denied refuge to non-residents, forcing the elderly to go from town totown in search of assistance. Citizens oftendivided the poor into two categories: the \"wor-thy poor\" who were unable to support them-selves because of illness, disability, or old age,through no fault of their own, and the immoral,lazy, alcoholic poor. The elderly who had failedto save for their older years were also deemed bysome to be unworthy of assistance by the com-munity (Fleming, Evans, & Chutka, 2003; ThePoorhouse Story, 2005). The poor were oftensent to poorhouses. Poorhouses, which werewarehouses for the old, insane, widowed, un-married mothers, criminals, and drunks, wereoften filthy and unsafe. Physical abuse, lack ofwaste facilities, rats, and poor food made poor-houses dangerous places for the elderly, yet thepoor elderly often ended up supported by thecommunity and placed in the poorhouse. Military pensions were initiated by the U.S. government in 1861. In 1904, PresidentTheodore Roosevelt established old age as a dis-ability. By 1910, 25% of the elderly U.S. popu-lation (Northern white soldiers and their wid-ows) was receiving military pensions. Militarypensions accounted for 43% of federal expendi-tures. This first pension system did not last\u2014it dissolved after supporting the last Unionveterans and their families (Fleming, Evans, &Chutka, 2003). After the Civil War, elderly blacks worked as sharecroppers or became dependent upon theirextended families. Black, white, and Hispanictenant farmers worked well into their old age,lacking the education and resources to do oth-erwise. Older blacks migrated to the cities as themechanical cotton picker forced them from theirland. Those who did not migrate to the citiessuffered ever worsening poverty (Fleming,Evans, & Chutka, 2003). By 1900, poorhouses had changed into old- age homes. The costs of old-age homes becamea burden for many counties, so in these countieselders were transferred to state-funded mentalinstitutions. Charitable homes came into being,run by religious organizations, benevolent soci-eties, and ethnic organizations. For-profit homesalso developed, serving the chronically ill or dis-abled. Standards and oversight on all of thesefacilities was minimal (Fleming, Evans, &Chutka, 2003). By the 1920s, the elderly population in the United States was increasingly seen as obsolete.The workplace denigrated older workers, seeingthem as less productive and with too few attrib-utes for working in the factories. Older work-ers were more likely to be injured on the job.Unions pushed for older workers to leave tomake room for younger workers. Firms began tointroduce mandatory retirement. Persons over45 years of age began to have trouble findingwork. Older workers suddenly found themselves28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 48 Successful Aging 49 without work, health insurance, unemploymentinsurance, or retirement savings (Fleming,Evans, & Chutka, 2003). The 1920s also brought the fall of the stock market and inflation, and led to the GreatDepression of the 1930s. In 1920, 25% of olderadults were impoverished. This increased to30% before the Depression, to 50% in 1935,and to 66% by 1940 (Fleming, Evans, &Chutka, 2003). There was mass unemployment,and poor families could no longer afford to sup-port their elders. Old people became dependentupon local and state governments for support. Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935. This act provided income assistancefor the elderly. Roosevelt's purpose was to enacta law that would give some measure of protec-tion to the average U.S. citizen and his or herfamily against a poverty-ridden old age. Butthen, medical costs began to rise, forcing the eld-erly to again rely on the government for assis-tance. Medicare and Medicaid were signed intolaw in 1965 by President Johnson. Medicare andMedicaid offered a form of health insurance tothose who previously had been seen as uninsur-able families (Fleming, Evans, & Chutka, 2003). County \"poor farms\" continued to exist. The Social Security Act of 1935, however, deniedfunding to these facilities. Private care homesflourished in the 1940s, again with few stan-dards or oversights. Social pressures begat thefor-profit long-term care industry. In the 1950s,a federal relationship flourished with theproviders. By 1960, however, there was still ashortage of 500,000 long-term care beds in theUnited States. By 1997, nearly 4% of the U.S.population was being cared for in nursinghomes. Currently, about 55% of persons 85 orolder are impaired and require long-term care(Carbonell, 2005).In 1880, 75% of men 65 or older were employed, being too poor to retire. They leftwork due to poor health or the inability to findwork. With the emphasis on youth and the pas-sage of the Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid bills, the number of older men whoare employed has steadily dropped throughoutthe years. In 2003, less than 20% of men 65 orolder worked full- or part-time (Carbonell,2005). Successful Aging Some may consider successful aging an oxy-moron. The idea of aging successfully may notbe considered a possibility in our youth-obsessed society. The later years of life are mostoften considered a time of decline, disability,dissatisfaction, and loneliness. There is no con-sensus on a definition of successful aging. Oneview is to consider success as reaching theextreme in health and function at an advancedage. An alternative view is successfully adaptingto changes in the aging process, while anotherperspective might be accomplishing individualgoals or experiencing an ultimate feeling ofwell-being (vonFaber et al., 2001). It might bebest to consider a combination of psychosocialand biomedical paradigms. A psychosocial viewincludes acceptance of death, life satisfaction,and feelings of well-being. A biomedical modelis seen more as an avoidance of disease and dis-ability. One must not look at successful aging asmerely an avoidance of disease and disability,but as an achievement of a sense of autonomy,dignity, and absence of suffering (Glass, 2003). It may be argued that all or a combination of views may describe success in reaching old age.A study conducted in Leiden, Netherlands,explored the meaning of successful aging in28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 49 50 Chapter 2: The Aging Population those reaching 85 years of age. Data obtainedfrom 599 elderly showed greater than 45%qualified as successful in the area of well-beingwhile only 10% met criteria as successful in thearea of functioning. In qualitative interviews,subjects identified successful aging as more ofan adaptive process than reaching a state ofbeing. Social function and feelings of well-beingwere valued more than physical and psychoso-cial well-being (vonFaber et al., 2001). Numerous studies have been conducted on identifying characteristics of or predictors to oldage. Two cohorts of adolescent boys (college stu-dents and core-city youth) were followed for 60years or until death. Physical and psychosocialdata were gathered intermittently over this time.Predictor variables at age 50 included uncon-trollable factors and personally controlled factorsthat distinguished \"happy-well\" and \"sad-sick\"elderly. Protective factors included personallycontrolled factors of smoking, driving, exercise,weight, and education. Two additional factorsconsidered modifiable included a stable marriageand maturity of defenses. An absence of alcoholand cigarette use before age 50 was most protec-tive (Valliant & Mukamal, 2001). This wouldpoint to the concept that poor health in late lifeis not inevitable and modifiable risk factors con-tribute to successful aging. A group of over 6,000 elderly Japanese men in Hawaii were studied over 28 years notingsurvival rates, development of clinical illness,and physical and cognitive functioning overtime. Predictors of healthy aging were identi-fied as low blood pressure, low serum glucose,not smoking cigarettes, and not being obese.Risk factors present at young and middle life areconsidered possible markers for late life mor-bidity and disability. This study further notedthat changes made to these factors at any time,even in late life, could provide a benefit (Reedet al., 1998). Centenarians Centenarians make up the fastest growing segment of our population in the United States,with the over-85-year-olds making up the sec-ond fastest growing segment. Per the U.S.Census of 1990, 37,306 persons were classifiedas centenarians. Four in five centenarians arewomen, and 78% of this age group is non-Hispanic white. African Americans make up thesecond largest group at 16%. This correlateswith 76% and 12% of the total population,respectively. In the next 40 years, the number ofcentenarians may reach 850,000, dependingupon changes in life expectancy over these years.Hispanic and Asian Americans will share agreater percentage of this age group, with non-Hispanic whites nearing 55%. Centenarians were found to be a predomi- nately lower educated, more impoverished,widowed, and more disabled population as com-pared to other elderly cohorts (U.S. DHHS,1990). The lower education of this cohort is notsurprising considering the increase in levels ofeducation noted over the span of the past cen-tury. The marital status of centenarians wasoverwhelmingly widowed, with 84% of 100-year-old women widowed as compared to 58%of men. Poverty status is more varied in thisgroup and is dependent on race. Women gen-erally were more likely to live in poverty in thisage group. White centenarians are less likelythan other races except Asian and PacificIslanders to live in poverty. Disability, identifiedas having mobility and self-care limitations, wasseen across all races. Not surprising, consistentwith disability trends, all races of centenariansexcept American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 50 Successful Aging 51 were noted to be not living alone. The increasedlikelihood of living in a nursing home at thisage was noted in all race categories. The New England Centenarian study is a population-based study conducted within theNew England area. The researchers noted a sur-prising heterogeneity in this group including awide range of economic status, educationalattainment, racial background, and origin ofbirth. Physical status varied widely as well.Fifteen percent of centenarians in this studywere still living independently at home while50% lived in nursing homes and the remainderlived with family. Three quarters of the studygroup suffered from some form of cognitiveimpairment. Health histories noted 95% of sub-jects enjoyed unimpaired health well into theirninth decade (Perls et al., 1999). Most notablein this study is the observation that the olderone gets, the healthier one has been. It is sus-pected the centenarians have not necessarily sur-vived disease but have avoided chronic/acutediseases, successfully navigating through obsta-cles and the physical/psychosocial challenges oftheir lives (Griffith, 2004). Secrets of Aging Why do some people live longer than others?Why is there such a discrepancy in functionalityat very old age? As noted previously, several fac-tors may contribute to reaching old age. Lifestylechoices including diet, exercise, socialization,and coping with stress play a large part. Geneticsalso play a role, especially in those surviving overthe age of 80. Lifestyle changes can maximize thegenetic potential, but to attain the age of 100requires a special genetic makeup. This is seen ina study comparing people with siblings wholived to 100 to people (the same age as the othergroup) whose siblings died at age 73 (average lifeBox 2-1 Resource List Aging Statistics: Federal Interagency Forum on Aging- Related Statistics: http://www.agingstats.gov Administration on Aging: http://www.aoa.gov/prof/Statistics/statistics.asp Centers the Life ExpectancyCalculator at: www.livingto100.com28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 51 52 Chapter 2: The Aging Population expectancy of the late 1800s). The centenariansiblings were 3.5 times more likely to reach 80and 4 times more likely to reach 90 years. Thesecentenarian siblings were noted to weigh less,take fewer medications, and have fewer chronicdiseases (e.g., heart disease, hypertension). Theimpact of genetic makeup vs. familial exposureto diet and exercise practices or longevity in gen-eral is not yet known. A goal of the national health initiative, Healthy People 2010, is to increase quality andextend years of healthy life. A shift in attitudesby society, including health professionals, isneeded to ensure this is accomplished. Dis-pelling myths and correcting stereotypes of theaged is a starting point ( Figure 2-7 ). A positive view of aging as a normal process not necessar-ily including illness and disease is needed.Improved insight by Americans to the benefitsof successful aging may decrease the feelings ofdenial and foreboding when faced with thismilestone (Gavan, 2003).Figure 2-7 The majority of people are healthy, active, andcontinue to be engaged in society after retirement.

How will the prevalence of aged patients affect your nursing practice? What are the implications foryour ongoing nursing education? 2. Healthful living becomes ever more important to prevent the chronic diseases of the aged. Fewer chronic diseases in the aged could mean that more health care services are avail-able for those without chronic diseases. What is healthful living? What will your role bein promoting healthful living to your patients? Should nurses be responsible for pro-moting healthful living when they could be caring for sick patients? 3. The health care of the baby boomers will likely be affected by changes in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. What implications does this have for your nursing practice? Howmight you address this issue as a nurse? How might you address this issue as a citizen? 4. The population of the United States is becoming ever more ethnically and culturally diverse. What health care issues can you foresee as this ethnically diverse population ages? 5. Think about older celebrities in the United States and abroad, and compare your thoughts about them to your thoughts about older people in general. Do you have dif-ferent thoughts and feelings about Sean Connery than you do about a nursing homepatient? How about those celebrities who are growing older-Cher, The Rolling Stones,Paul McCartney, Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris? Compare and contrast a well-knownsenior celebrity with an aged patient you have recently met. Personal Reflections The aging of America will affect you both personally and professionally. Governmentresources will become more and more strained as the baby boomers become elders and beginto use these resources. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security may not exist as we knowthem. There will be fewer beds available in both acute and chronic care facilities to care forthe growing aged population. There may not be enough geriatric specialty physicians andnurses to care for the vast numbers of older adults. How could these circumstances affectyou and your family? What are your personal plans for your own aging? Have you startedto save money for retirement? Are you living a healthy lifestyle, eating \"right,\" and exercis-ing? Are you or your children overweight? Do you smoke or drink alcohol excessively? Are you ready to become involved in the political process so that your opinion is heard?28438_CH02_029_056.qxd 6/6/06 5:06 PM Page 53 54 Chapter 2: The Aging Population Baby boomers: A large group of people born between 1946 and 1964, in the time after the secondWorld War.

Identify the major theories of aging.2. Compare the similarities and differences between biological and psychosocial theories. 3. Describe the process of aging using a biological and a psychosocial perspective. 4. Analyze the rationale for using multiple theories of aging to describe the complex phenomenon of aging. 5. Describe a general theoretical framework, taken from all of the aging theories, that will assist nurses in making clinical decisions in gerontology.

Is there anyone who wouldnot be interested in knowing how the humanorganism ages? Doesn't everyone want to live along and healthy life? There are few who wouldnot want to see what the future holds for ourbodies and minds; even more curiosity sur-rounds what advances have been made or willpossibly be made to alter and slow the agingprocess. Understanding what knowledge theo-ries of aging have generated and reviewing thevalidity of these findings and how they impactevolution and scientific advances is a first steptoward understanding the mystery of aging.Troen (2003) suggests: \"The beneficial paradoxmay be that the maximum lifespan potential ofhumans may have been achieved, in part, due toour ability to grow old\" (p. 5). Dickoff and Wiedenbach (1968) assert that for theories to be useful in a practice discipline,they must be specific enough to guide nursingcare of select populations in a given setting. Thecomplex needs of older adults include declininghealth and functioning that may require movingto more supportive environments. Psychologicalchallenges facing older adults include dealingwith social and economic losses, finding a mean-ingful life after retirement, and contemplatingdeath. Cultural, spiritual, regional, socioeco-nomic, educational, and environmental factors aswell as health status impact older adults' per-ceptions and choices about their health careneeds. Theories that can effectively guide nurs-ing practice with older adults must be compre-hensive yet consider individual differences.According to Haight and colleagues, \"a goodgerontological theory integrates knowledge, tellshow and why phenomena are related, leads toprediction, and provides process and under-standing. In addition, a good theory must beholistic and take into account all that impacts ona person throughout a lifetime of aging\" (Haight,Barba, Tesh, & Courts, 2002, p. 14). Since the early 1950s, sociologists, psychol- ogists, and biologists have proposed theories ofaging. Although there is increased emphasis inthe nursing literature on issues regarding thegrowing elderly population, little work has beendone to develop discipline-specific aging theo-ries. The purpose of this chapter is to review thechronological development of biopsychosocialaging theories, the evidence supporting or refut-ing these theories, and their application to nurs-ing practice. CINAHL, the National Library ofMedicine, the Web of Science, PsycINFO, andSociological Abstracts databases were reviewedto assess support for and clinical application ofthe theories of aging. Psychosocial Theories of Aging The earliest theories on aging came from thepsychosocial disciplines ( Table 3-1 ). Psycho- social theories attempt to explain aging in termsof behavior, personality, and attitude change.Development is viewed as a lifelong processcharacterized by transitions. Psychological the-ories are concerned with personality or egodevelopment and the accompanying challengesassociated with various life stages. How mentalprocesses, emotions, attitudes, motivation, andpersonality influence adaptation to physical andsocial demands are central issues. Sociological theorists consider how changing roles, relationships, and status within a cultureor society impact the older adult's ability toadapt. Societal norms can affect how individu-als envision their role and function within that28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 58 Psychosocial Theories of Aging 59 Table 3-1 Psychosocial Theories of Aging Theory DescriptionSociological Theories Changing roles, relationships, status, and generational cohort impact theolder adult's ability to adapt. Activity Remaining occupied and involved is necessary to a satisfying late-life.Disengagement Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships serves to maintain social equilibrium and promote internal reflection. Subculture The elderly prefer to segregate from society in an aging subculture sharing loss of status and societal negativity regarding the aged. Health and mobil-ity are key determinants of social status. Continuity Personality influences roles and life satisfaction and remains consistent throughout life. Past coping patterns recur as older adults adjust to physi-cal, financial, and social decline and contemplate death. Identifying withone's age group, finding a residence compatible with one's limitations, andlearning new roles postretirement are major tasks. Age stratification Society is stratified by age groups that are the basis for acquiring resources, roles, status, and deference from others. Age cohorts are influenced by theirhistorical context and share similar experiences, beliefs, attitudes, andexpectations of life course transitions. Person-Environment Function is affected by ego strength, mobility, health, cognition, sensoryFit perception, and the environment. Competency changes one's ability to adapt to environmental demands. Gerotranscendence The elderly transform from a materialistic/rational perspective toward one- ness with the universe. Successful transformation includes an outward focus,accepting impending death, substantive relationships, intergenerationalconnectedness, and unity with the universe. Psychological Theories Explain aging in terms of mental processes, emotions, attitudes, motivation,and personality development that is characterized by life stage transitions. Human needs Five basic needs motivate human behavior in a lifelong process toward need fulfillment. Individualism Personality consists of an ego and personal and collective unconsciousness that views life from a personal or external perspective. Older adults searchfor life meaning and adapt to functional and social losses. Stages of personality Personality develops in eight sequential stages with corresponding life tasks.development The eighth phase, integrity versus despair, is characterized by evaluating life accomplishments; struggles include letting go, accepting care, detach-ment, and physical and mental decline. Life-course/lifespan Life stages are predictable and structured by roles, relationships, values, anddevelopment goals. Persons adapt to changing roles and relationships. Age group norms and characteristics are an important part of the life course. Selective optimization Individuals cope with aging losses through activity/role selection, optimiza-with compensation tion, and compensation. Critical life points are morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Selective optimization with compensation facilitates successful aging.28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 59 60 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging society, and thus impact role choices as well ashow roles are enacted. There has been a largeredefinition of the role of women in the UnitedStates since the 1960s. Such cohort or genera-tional variables are a key component of socio-logical theories of aging. Sociological Theories of Aging Activity TheorySociological theorists have attempted to explainolder adult behavior in relationship to societywith such concepts as disengagement, activity,and continuity. One of the earliest theoriesaddressing the aging process was begun byHavighurst and Albrecht in 1953 when theydiscussed the concept of activity engagementand positive adaptation to aging. From study-ing a sample of adults, they concluded thatsociety expects retired older adults to remainactive contributors. Activity theory was con-ceived as an actual theory in 1963 and purportsthat remaining occupied and involved is a nec-essary ingredient to satisfying late-life(Havighurst, Neugarten, & Tobin, 1963). Theauthors do not qualify the activity characteris-tics that are most directly linked to life satis-faction. Havighurst and Albrecht associateactivity with psychosocial health and suggestactivity as a means to prolong middle age anddelay the negative effects of old age. Anassumption of this theory is that inactivity neg-atively impacts one's self-concept and perceivedquality of life and hastens aging. Arguments against this point of view are that it fails to consider that activity choices are oftenconstrained by physical, economic, and socialresources. Furthermore, roles assumed by olderadults are highly influenced by societal expec-tations (Birren & Schroots, 2001). Maddox(1963) suggests, however, that leisure time pre-sents new opportunities for activities and rolessuch as community service that may be moreconsistent with these limitations. A second crit-icism of activity theory is the unproven assertionthat continued activity delays onset of the neg-ative effects of aging. Despite these criticisms, the central theme of activity theory, that remaining active in old ageis desirable, is supported by research. Lemonand colleagues found a direct relationship be-tween role and activity engagement and life sat-isfaction among older adults (Lemon, Bengston,& Peterson, 1972). The authors also observedthat the quality of activities, as perceived byolder adults, is more important than the quan-tity. Other investigators add that informal activ-ities such as meeting friends for lunch orpursuing hobbies through group activities aremore likely to improve life satisfaction thanformal or solitary activities (Longino & Kart,1982). In a more recent study of older Amer-icans, participation in shared tasks was an im-portant predictor of life satisfaction, particularlyamong retirees (Harlow & Cantor, 1996). Suc-cessful aging means being capable of doingactivities that are important to the older adultdespite limitations (Schroots, 1996). Disengagement Theory In stark contrast to activity theorists, sociolo-gists Cumming and Henry (1961) assert thataging is characterized by gradual disengage-ment from society and relationships. The au-thors contend that this separation is desired bysociety and older adults, and serves to maintainsocial equilibrium. Persons are freed from socialresponsibilities and gain time for internal reflec-tion, while the transition of responsibility fromold to young promotes societal functioning28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 60 Psychosocial Theories of Aging 61 without interruption from lost members. Di-minishing social contacts lead to further disen-gagement in a cyclical process that is systematicand inevitable. The outcome of disengagementis a new equilibrium that is ideally satisfying toboth the individual and society. The emphasis this theory places on social withdrawal is challenged by later theorists whocontend that a key element of life satisfactionamong older adults appears to be engagement inmeaningful relationships and activities (Baltes,1987; Lemon, Bengston, & Peterson, 1972;Neumann, 2000; Schroots, 1996). Others con-tend that the decision to withdraw varies acrossindividuals and that disengagement theory failsto account for differences in (Achenbaum &Bengtson, 1994; Marshall, found that demographic disad-vantages and age-related transitions were relatedto a greater desire for disengagement, support,and stability. Elders who were married andhealthy were more likely to report a desire for anenergetic lifestyle. Cumming and Henry's notionof a necessary fit between society's needs and olderadult activity is supported, however (Back, 1980;Birren & Schroots, 2001; Riley, Johnson, &Foner, 1972). Until recently, Social Security lawsplaced economic barriers against retirementbefore the mid 60s, but as years of healthy lifeexpectancy increase, society is reframing itsnotions about the capability of older adults tomake valuable contributions (Uhlenberg, 1992).Many adults are working past retirement age orbegin part-time work in a new field. Others areactively engaged in a variety of volunteer projectsthat may substantially benefit their communities.The many examples of what is now termed \"suc-cessful aging\" are challenging the common asso-ciation of aging with disease.Subculture TheoryUnlike activity theorists, Rose (1965) views olderadults as a unique subculture within societyformed as a defensive response to society's nega-tive attitudes and the loss of status that accom-panies aging. As in disengagement theory, Roseproposes that although this subculture segregatesthe elderly from the rest of society, older adultsprefer to interact among themselves. Rose con-tends that in the United States, one's degree ofhealth and mobility is more critical in definingsocial status than occupation, education, orincome. Older adults have a social disadvantageregarding status and associated respect because ofthe functional decline that accompanies aging. Rose's theory argues for social reform. Growing numbers of older adults make it nec-essary to pay more attention to the needs of thisage group and are challenging the prevailingview of aging as negative, undesirable, burden-some, and lacking status. Questions are begin-ning to be asked about whether society shouldbe more supportive of older adults in terms ofthe environment, health care, work opportuni-ties, and social resources. The emphasis onwhether societal or older adults' needs takeprecedence is beginning to shift in favor of olderadults. McMullen (2000) argues that sociologi-cal theories need to more clearly address thediversity among older adults as well as the dis-parity from other age groups.Continuity TheoryIn the late 1960s, Havighurst and colleaguesrecognized that neither activity nor disengage-ment theories fully explain successful agingfrom a sociological point of view (Havighurst,Neugarten, & Tobin, 1968). Borrowing frompsychology, they hypothesized that personalityinfluences the roles one assumes, how roles are28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 61 62 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging enacted, and one's satisfaction with living. Theyexplained their new perspective in the continu-ity theory, also known as development theory.Continuity theory suggests that personality iswell-developed by the time one reaches old ageand tends to remain consistent across the life-span. Coping and personality patterns provideclues as to how an aging individual will adjustto changes in health, environment, or socioeco-nomic conditions, and what activities he or shewill choose to engage in; thus, continuity the-ory acknowledges that individual differencesproduce varied responses to aging. Havighurst and associates identified four per- sonality types from their observations of olderadults: integrated, armored-defended, passive-dependent, and unintegrated. Integrated per-sonality types have adjusted well to aging, asevidenced by activity engagement that may bebroad (reorganizers), more selective (focused), ordisengaged. Armored-defended individuals tendto continue the activities and roles held duringmiddle age, whereas passive-dependent personsare either highly dependent or exhibit disinter-est in the external world. Least well-adjusted areunintegrated personality types who fail to copewith aging successfully. Havighurst (1972) laterdefined adjusting to physical, financial, andsocial decline; contemplating death; and devel-oping a personal and meaningful perspective onthe end of life as the tasks of older adulthood.Successful accomplishment of these tasks is evi-denced by identifying with one's age group,finding a living environment that is compatiblewith physical functioning, and learning newsocietal roles postretirement. Research suggests that self-perception of per- sonality remains stable over time, and attitudeand degree of adaptation to old age are related tolife satisfaction. When older adults were askedhow they thought they had changed over theyears, almost all respondents thought they werestill essentially the same person. Degree of con-tinuity related to a more positive affect in thesesubjects (Troll & Skaff, 1997). In another study,Efklides and colleagues investigated effects ofdemographics, health status, attitude, and adap-tation to old age on quality of life perceptionsamong older adults. The authors reported thatpositive attitude and adaptation to old age wereassociated with better perceptions about qualityof life in this Greek sample (Efklides, Kalait-zidou, & Chankin, 2003). Critics of this theory,however, point out that the social contextwithin which one ages may be more importantthan personality in determining what and howroles are played (Birren & Schroots, 2001).Age Stratification TheoryIn the 1970s, sociologists began to examine theinterdependence between older adults and so-ciety, recognizing that aging and society areinterrelated and cause reciprocal changes to indi-viduals, age group cohorts, and society (Riley,Johnson, & Foner, 1972). Riley and colleaguesobserved that society is stratified into differentage categories that are the basis for acquiringresources, roles, status, and deference from othersin society. In addition, age cohorts are influencedby the historical context in which they live; thus,age cohorts and corresponding roles vary acrossgenerations. People born in the same cohort havesimilar experiences with shared meanings, ide-ologies, orientations, attitudes, and values as wellas expectations regarding the timing of life coursetransitions. Individuals in different generationshave different experiences that may cause themto age in different ways (Riley, 1994). Age stratification transitioned aging theory from a focus on the individual to a broader con-28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 62 Psychosocial Theories of Aging 63 text that alerted gerontologists to the influenceof cohort groups and the socioeconomic andpolitical impact on how individuals age (Marshall,1996). Uhlenburg (1996) borrowed from agestratification theory in developing a frameworkfor understanding what social changes areneeded to reduce the burden that aging cohortsplace on society in terms of their care needs atdifferent stages of later life. Newsom and Schulz (1996) demonstrated that physical impairment is associated with fewersocial contacts, less social support, depression,and lower life satisfaction. This finding suggeststhat social networks are an important element inhow individuals age. Yin and Lai (1983) used agestratification theory to explain the changing sta-tus of older adults due to differences amongcohort groups. Investigators studying age segre-gation versus integration in residential settingslearned that outcomes were less favorable amongsettings with single cohort groups (Hagestad &Dannefer, 2001; Uhlenberg, 2000).Person-Environment-Fit TheoryIn addition to the broadened view of aging thatemerged in the 1970s, another shift in agingtheory in the early 1980s blended existingtheories from different disciplines. Lawton's(1982) person-environment-fit theory intro-duced functional competence in relationship tothe environment as a central theme. Functionalcompetence is affected by multiple intraper-sonal conditions such as ego strength, motorskills, biologic health, cognitive capacity, andsensori-perceptual capacity as well as externalconditions posed by the environment. Thedegree of competency may change as one ages,affecting functional ability in relationship to environmental demands. Persons' ability tomeet these demands is affected by their level of function and influences their ability to adapt to the environment. Those functioning atlower levels can tolerate fewer environmentaldemands. Lawton's (1982) theory is useful for exploring optimal environments for older adults with func-tional limitations and identifying needed modifi-cations in older adult residential settings. Buildingon Lawton's work, Wahl (2001) developed sixmodels to explain relationships between agingand the environment home, institution, and relo-cation decision making. O'Connor and Vallerand(1994) used Lawton's theory to examine the re-lationship between long-term care residents'adjustment and their motivational style and envi-ronment. Older adults with self-determinedmotivational styles were better adjusted whenthey lived in homes that provided opportunitiesfor freedom and choice, whereas residents withless self-determined motivational styles were bet-ter adjusted when they lived in high constraintenvironments. The authors conclude that theirfindings support the person-environment-fit the-ory of adjustment in old age.Gerotranscendence TheoryOne of the most recent aging theories isTornstam's (1994) theory of gerotranscendence.This theory proposes that aging individualsundergo a cognitive transformation from amaterialistic, rational perspective toward one-ness with the universe. Characteristics of suc-cessful transformation include a more outwardor external focus, accepting impending deathwithout fear, an emphasis on substantive rela-tionships, a sense of connectedness with preced-ing and future generations, and spiritual unitywith the universe. Gerotranscendence borrowsfrom disengagement theory but does not idea that social disengagement is a necessary28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 63 64 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging and natural development. Tornstam asserts thatactivity and participation must be the result ofone's own choices that differ from one person toanother. Control over one's life in all situationsis essential for the person's adaptation to agingas a whole. Gerotranscendence has been tested in recent studies. In an ongoing longitudinal study basedon the principles of gerodynamics, Schroots(2003) is investigating how people manage theirlives, cope with transformations, and react toaffective-positive and negative life events. Innursing, Wadensten (2002) used the theory ofgerotranscendence to develop guidelines for careof older adults in a nursing home. The resultsindicate that these guidelines may be useful forfacilitating the process of gerotranscendence innursing home residents. Psychological Theories of Aging Human Needs TheoryAt the same time as activity theory was beingdeveloped, Maslow (1954), a psychologist, pub-lished the human needs theory. In this theory,Maslow surmised that a hierarchy of five needsmotivates human behavior: physiologic, safetyand security, love and belonging, self-esteem,and self-actualization. These needs are priori-tized such that more basic needs like physio-logical functioning or safety take precedenceover personal growth needs (love and belonging,self-esteem, and self-actualization). Movementis multidirectional and dynamic in a lifelong pro-cess toward need fulfillment. Self-actualizationrequires the freedom to express and pursue per-sonal goals and be creative in an environmentthat is stimulating and challenging. Although Maslow does not specifically address old age, it is clear that physical, eco-nomic, social, and environmental constraintsBox 3-1 Research Highlight Aim: This study investigated whether staff working with adults age 65 and oldercould recognize and interpret signs ofgerotranscendence, and described how thestaff addressed and cared for older peopleshowing signs of gerotranscendence. Methods: An interview guide was designed using Tornstam's (1994) three main ele-ments of gerotranscendence: the cosmiclevel, the self, and social and individualrelations. Thirty-four randomly selectednursing assistants, registered nurses, or oc-cupational therapists working at a Swedishnursing home were interviewed. Interviewswere audiotaped, transcribed, and codedusing a constant comparison method toelucidate themes. Findings: All staff noted signs of gerotrans- cendence, but they varied in which signsthey recognized and how they were inter-preted: pathological, invisible (rarely no-ticed), or normal. Staff interpretation wasmore consistent with activity theory, par-ticularly with respect to older adults whopreferred solitude over activity. Staff inter-preted this preference as pathological. Conclusion: An interpretative framework would facilitate staff understanding ofintrospective behavior displayed by olderadults. A framework in which thesebehaviors are considered normal aspectsof aging may impact staff attitudes andtheir approach to caregiving. Source: Wadensten, B., & Carlsson, M. (2001).

Journal of Advanced Nursing, 36, 635-642.28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 64 Psychosocial Theories of Aging 65 can impede need fulfillment of older adults.Maslow asserts that failure to grow leads to feel-ings of failure, depression, and the perceptionthat life is meaningless. Since inception, Maslow'stheory has been applied to varied age groups inmany disciplines. Ebersole, Hess, and Luggen(2004) link the tasks of aging described by sev-eral theorists (Butler & Lewis, 1982; Havighurst,1972; Peck, 1968) to the basic needs in Maslow'smodel. Jones and Miesen (1992) used Maslow'shierarchy to present a nursing care model forworking with aged persons with specific needsin an attempt to relate all patient needs to uni-versal, rather than exceptional, needs. The modelis designed to be used by caregivers in residen-tial settings. Theory of Individualism Like Maslow's theory, Jung's theory of individ-ualism is not specific to aging. Jung (1960)proposes a lifespan view of personality develop-ment rather than attainment of basic needs.Jung defines personality as composed of an egoor self-identity with a personal and collectiveunconsciousness. Personal unconsciousness isthe private feelings and perceptions surround-ing significant persons or life events. The col-lective unconscious is shared by all persons andcontains latent memories of human origin. Thecollective unconscious is the foundation of per-sonality on which the personal unconsciousnessand ego are built. Individual personalities tendto view life primarily either through the self orthrough others; thus, extroverts are more con-cerned with the world around them, whereasintroverts interpret experiences from the per-sonal perspective. As individuals age, Jungproposes that elders engage in an \"inner search\"to critique their beliefs and accomplishments.According to Jung, successful aging meansacceptance of the past and an ability to copewith functional decline and loss of significantothers. Neugarten (1968) supports Jung's asso-ciation of aging and introspection assertsthat \"interiority\" promotes positive innergrowth. Subsequent theorists also describeintrospection as a part of healthy aging (Erik-son, 1963; Havighurst, Neugarten, & Tobin,1968).Stages of psychologists' theories at thetime, Erikson's theory focuses on individualdevelopment. According to Erikson (1963), per-sonality develops in eight sequential stages thathave a corresponding life task that one may suc-ceed at or fail to accomplish. Progression to asubsequent life stage requires that tasks at priorstages must be completed successfully. Olderadults experience the developmental stageknown as \"ego integrity versus despair.\" Eriksonproposes that this final phase of development ischaracterized by evaluating one's life and accom-plishments for meaning. In later years, Eriksonand colleagues expanded upon his originaldescription of integrity versus despair, notingthat older adults struggle with letting go,accepting the care of others, detaching from life,and physical and mental decline (Erikson,Erikson, & Kivnick, 1986). Several authors have expanded upon Erikson's work. Peck (1968) refined the task withinErikson's stage of ego integrity versus despair intothree challenges: ego differentiation versus workrole reoccupation, body transcendence versus bodypreoccupation, and ego transcendence versus egopreoccupation. Major issues such as meaningfullife after retirement, the empty nest syndrome,dealing with the functional decline of aging, andcontemplating one's mortality are consistent withPeck's conceptualization. Butler and Lewis (1982)28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 65 66 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging later defined the challenges of late life as adjust-ing to infirmity, developing satisfaction with one'slived life, and preparing for death, mirroring thosetasks described earlier by Peck. Erikson's theory is widely employed in the behavioral sciences. In nursing, Erikson'smodel is often used as a framework for exam-ining the challenges faced by different agegroups. In a recent study of frail elderly menand women, Neumann (2000) used Erikson'stheoretical framework when asking partici-pants to discuss their perceptions about themeaning of their lives. She found that olderadults who expressed higher levels of meaningand energy described a sense of connectedness,self-worth, love, and respect that was absentamong participants who felt unfulfilled. Thisfinding is consistent with the potential for pos-itive or negative outcomes described byErikson and colleagues (1986) in his stage of\"integrity versus despair.\" Life-Course (Lifespan Development) ParadigmIn the late 1970s, the predominant theme ofbehavioral psychology moved toward the con-cept of \"life course,\" in which life, althoughunique to each individual, is divided intostages with predictable patterns (Back, 1980).The significance of this shift was the inclusionof late as well as early life. Most theorists up tothis point had focused primarily on childhoodin their research. The substance of the life-course paradigm drew from the work of aEuropean psychologist in the 1930s (B\u00fchler,1933). This new emphasis on adulthoodoccurred because of a demographic shift towardincreasing numbers of older adults, the emer-gence of gerontology as a specialty, and theavailability of subjects from longitudinal stud-ies of childhood begun during the 1920s and1930s (Baltes, 1987). The central concepts of the life-course per- spective blend key elements in psychologicaltheories such as life stages, tasks, and person-ality development with sociological conceptssuch as role behavior and the interrelationshipbetween individuals and society. The centraltenet of life-course is that life occurs in stagesthat are structured according to one's roles, rela-tionships, internal values, and goals. Individ-uals may choose their goals but are limited byexternal constraints. Goal achievement is asso-ciated with life satisfaction (B\u00fchler, 1933).Individuals must adapt to changed roles andrelationships that occur throughout life, such asgetting married, finishing school, completingmilitary service, getting a job, and retiring(Cunningham & Brookbank, 1988). Successfuladaptation to life change may necessitate revis-ing beliefs in order to be consistent with socie-tal expectations. The life-course paradigm isconcerned with understanding age groupnorms and their characteristics. Since the1970s, the work of many behavioral psycholo-gists such as Elder, Hareven, and Jackson hasemerged from the life-course perspective, whichremains a dominant theme in the psychologyliterature today. Selective optimization withcompensation, discussed in the following sec-tion, is one example of a theory that emergedfrom the life-course perspective.Selective Optimization with Compensation TheoryBaltes's (1987) theory of successful aging emergedfrom his study of psychological processes acrossthe lifespan and, like earlier theories, focuses onthe individual. He asserts that individuals learnto cope with the functional losses of aging28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 66 Biological Theories of Aging 67 through processes of selection, optimization,and compensation. Aging individuals becomemore selective in activities and roles as limita-tions present themselves; at the same time, theychoose those activities and roles that are mostsatisfying (optimization). Finally, individualsadapt by seeking alternatives when functionallimits prohibit sustaining former roles or activ-ities. As people age, they pass through criticallife points related to morbidity, mortality, andquality of life. The outcome of these criticaljunctures may result in lower or higher orderfunctioning that is associated with higher orlower risk, respectively, for mortality. Selectiveoptimization with compensation is a positivecoping process that facilitates successful aging(Baltes & Baltes, 1990). Much of the recent research testing psychoso- cial theories centers on life-course concepts(Baltes, 2003). anongoing longitudinal study called \"Life-CourseDynamics,\" Shroots examines the self-organiza-tion of behavior over the course of life. He hasfound that life structure tends to be consistentover time and is influenced by life events andexperiences. The relationship of life events tostructure changes however, as we age. In an effortto outline the temporal and situational parame-ters of social life, Caspi (1987) developed a modelfor personality analysis using life-course conceptssuch as interactions among personality, age-based roles, and social transitions in a historicalcontext. Life-course principles have also beenused to examine gender differences in retirementsatisfaction. Quick and Moen (1988) report thatretirement quality for women is associated withgood health, a continuous career, earlier retire-ment, and a good postretirement income. Formen, good health, an enjoyable career, low work-role prominence, preretirement planning, andretiring voluntarily impacted satisfaction. Theauthors conclude that a gender-sensitive life-course approach to life transitions is essential. Caspi and Elder (1986) criticized the life- course perspective of aging because it assumesthat adaptation is governed by factors beyondthe immediate situation. In a small sample ofwomen, the authors examined how social andpsychological factors experienced by olderwomen in the 1930s relate to life satisfaction.They report relationships between intellect,social activity, and life satisfaction in older,working class women, but emotional health wasa better predictor of life satisfaction among olderwomen from higher class origins. Differences inhow the Depression impacted adaptation to oldage among women from distinct social classesare described. The authors conclude that theinfluence of social change on life course is inter-twined with individual factors. Biological Theories of Aging The biological theories explain informationregarding the physiologic processes that changewith aging. In other words, how is aging man-ifested on the molecular level in the cell, tissues,and body systems; how does the body-mindinteraction affect aging; what biochemicalprocesses impact aging; and how do one's chro-mosomes impact the overall aging process? Doeseach system age at the same rate? Does each cellin a system age at the same rate? How does one'schronological age influence an individual whois experiencing a pathophysiological diseaseprocess\u2014how does the actual disease influencethe organism as well as the treatment, which28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 67 68 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging might include drugs, immunomodulation , surgery, or radiation? There are several theoriesthat purport to explain aging at the molecular,cellular, organ, and system levels; however, noone theory has evolved. Both genetics and envi-ronment influence the multifaceted phenome-non of aging. Some aging theorists divide the biologic the- ories into two categories: 1. A stochastic or statistical perspective, which identifies episodic events thathappen throughout one's life that causerandom cell damage and accumulateover time, thus causing aging 2. The nonstochastic theories that view aging as a series of predeterminedevents happening to all organisms in atimed framework. Others believe aging is more likely the result of both programmed and stochastic concepts(Miquel, 1998). For example, there are specificprogrammed events in the life of a cell, but theyalso accumulate genetic damage to the mito- chondria due to free radicals and the loss of self-replication as they age. The following dis-cussion presents descriptions of the differenttheories in the stochastic and nonstochastic the-ory categories and also provides studies thatsupport the various theoretical explanations. Stochastic Theories Studies of animals reflect that 35% of the effectsof aging are due to genetics and 65% are envi-ronmentally induced (Finch & Tanzi, 1997).There is no set of statistics to validate that thesesame findings are true with human organisms.The following stochastic theories are discussed:free radical theory, Orgel/error theory, wear andtear theory, and connective tissue theory.Free Radical Theory Oxidative free radical theory postulates thataging is due to oxidative metabolism and theeffects of free radicals, which are the end productsof oxidative metabolism. Free radicals are pro-duced when the body uses oxygen, such as withexercise. This theory emphasizes the significanceof how cells use oxygen (Hayflick, 1985). Alsoknown as superoxides, free radicals are thought toreact with proteins, lipids, deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA), and ribonucleic acid (RNA), causing cel-lular damage. This damage accumulates overtime and is thought to accelerate aging. Free radicals are chemical species that arise from atoms as single unpaired electrons. Becausea free radical molecule is unpaired it is able toenter reactions with other molecules, especiallyalong membranes and with nucleic acids. Freeradicals cause: Extensive cellular damage to DNA, which can cause malignancy andaccelerated aging, due to oxidativemodification of proteins that impact cell metabolism Lipid oxidation that damages phospho- lipids in cell membranes, DNA and base modifica- tions that cause gene modulation. This cellular membrane damage causes other chemicals to be blocked from their regularlyfriendly receptor sites, thus mitigating otherprocesses that may be crucial to cell metabolism.Mitochondrial deterioration due to oxidantscauses a significant loss of cell energy andgreatly decreases metabolism. Ames (2004) andHarman (1994) suggest some strategies to assistin delaying the mitochondrial decay, such as:28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 68 Biological Theories of Aging 69 Decrease calories in order to lower weight. Maintain a diet high in nutrients. Use antioxidants. Minimize accumulation of metals in the body that can trigger free radicalreactions. Dufour and Larsson (2004) cite evidence ofmitochondrial DNA damage accumulation andthe aging process with mice. With the destruction of membrane integrity comes fluid and electrolyte loss or excessdepending on how the membrane was affected.Little by little there is more tissue deterioration.The older adult is more vulnerable to free radi-cal damage because free radicals are attracted tocells that have transient or interrupted perfu-sion. Many older adults have decreased circula-tion because they have peripheral vascular aswell as coronary artery disease. These diseasestend to cause heart failure that can be poten-tially worsened with fluid overload and elec-trolyte imbalance. The majority of the evidence to support this theory is correlative in that oxidative damageincreases with age. It is thought that people wholimit calories, fat, and specific proteins in theirdiet may decrease the formation of free radicals.Roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are being researched in a variety of diseases such asatherosclerosis, vasospasms, cancers, trauma,stroke, asthma, arthritis, heart attack, dermati-tis, retinal damage, hepatitis, and periodontitis(Lakatta, 2000). Lee, Koo, and Min (2004) re-port that antioxidant nutraceuticals are assist-ing in managing and, in some cases, delayingsome of the manifestations of these diseases. Poonand colleagues (Poon, Calabrese, Scapagnini,& Butterfield, 2004) describe how two antioxi-dant systems and heat shock pro-teins) are decreased in age-related degenerativeneurological disorders. They also cite that freeradical-mediated lipid peroxidation and proteinoxidation affect central nervous system function.And now, for the first time, there is the possi-bility of investigating genetically altered animalsto determine the impact of oxidative damage inaging (Bokov, Chaudhuri, & Richardson, 2004). Examples of some sources of free radicals are listed in Box 3-2 . In some instances, free radi- cals reacting with other molecules can formmore free radicals, mutations, and malignan-cies. The free radical theory supports that as oneages, there is an accumulation of damage thathas been done to cells and, therefore, the organ-ism ages. Grune and Davies (2001) go so far asto describe the free radical theory of aging as\"the only aging theory to have stood the test oftime\" (p. 41). They further describe how freeradicals can generate cellular debris rich inlipids and proteins called lipofuscin whicholder adults have more of when compared toyounger adults. It is thought that lipofuscin , or age pigment, is a nondegradable materialthat decreases lysosomal function, which in turnimpacts an already disabled mitochondria(Brunk & Terman, 2002). Box 3-2 Exogenous Sources Tobacco smokePesticidesOrganic solventsRadiationOzone Selected medications28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 69 70 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging Orgel/Error TheoryThis theory suggests that, over time, cells accu-mulate errors in their DNA and RNA proteinsynthesis that cause the cells to die. Envi-ronmental agents and randomly induced eventscan cause error, with ultimate cellular changes.It is well known that large amounts of x-rayradiation cause chromosomal abnormalities.Thus, this theory proposes that aging would notoccur if destructive factors such as radiation didnot exist and cause \"errors\" such as mutationsand regulatory disorders. Hayflick (1996) does not support this theory, and explains that all aged cells do not have er-rant proteins, nor are all cells found with errantproteins old. Wear and Tear TheoryOver time, cumulative changes occurring incells age and damage cellular metabolism. Anexample includes the cell's inability to repairdamaged DNA, as in the aging cell. It is knownthat cells in heart muscle, neurons, striatedmuscle, and the brain cannot replace themselvesafter they are destroyed by wear and tear. Re-searchers cite gender-specific effects of aging onadrenocorticotropic activity that are consistentwith the wear and tear hypothesis of the rami-fications of lifelong exposure to stress (VanCauter, Leproult, & Kupfer, 1996). There issome speculation that excessive wear and teardue to exercising may accelerate aging by caus-ing increased free radical production, whichsupports the idea that no one theory of aging isresponsible but rather that a combination of fac-tors are responsible for aging. Studies of people with osteoarthritis suggest that cartilage cells age over time, and this de-generation is not due solely to strenuous exer-cise but also general wear and tear. It is pointedout that aged cells have lost the ability to coun-teract mechanical, inflammatory, and otherinjuries due to their senescence (Aigner, Rose, Martin, & Buckwalter, 2004).Connective Tissue TheoryThis theory is also referred to as cross-link theory,and it proposes that, over time, biochemicalprocesses create connections between structuresnot normally connected. Several cross-linkagesoccur rapidly between 30 and 50 years of age.However, no research has been identified thatcould stop these cross-links from occurring.Elastin dries up and cracks with age. Hence,skin with less elastin (as with the older adult)tends to be dried and wrinkled. Over time, dueto decreased extracellular fluid, numerous de-posits of sodium, chloride, and calcium build upin the cardiovascular system. No clinical appli-cation studies were found to support this theory. Nonstochastic Theories The nonstochastic theories of aging are foundedon a programmed perspective that is related togenetics or one's biological clock. Goldsmith(2004) suggests that aging is more likely to bean evolved beneficial characteristic and resultsfrom a complex structured process and not aseries of random events. The following pro-grammed theories are discussed: programmedtheory, gene/biological clock, neuroendocrine,and immunologic/autoimmune theory. Programmed TheoryAs people age, more of their cells start to decideto commit suicide or stop dividing. The Hayflick phenomenon, or human fibroblast replicative se- nescence model, suggests that cells divide until28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 70 Biological Theories of Aging 71 they can no longer divide, whereupon the cell'sinfrastructure recognizes this inability to furtherdivide and triggers the apoptosis sequence or death of the cell (Sozou & Kirkwood, 2001).Therefore, it is thought that cells have a finitedoubling potential and become unable to repli-cate after they have done so a number of times.Human cells age each time they replicate due tothe shortening of the telomere . Telomeres are the most distal appendages of the chromosomearms. This theory of programmed cell death isoften alluded to when the aging process is dis-cussed. The enzyme telomerase , also called a \"cellular fountain of youth,\" allows human cellsgrown in the laboratory to continue to replicatelong past the time they normally stop dividing.Normal human cells do not have telomerase. It is hypothesized that some cancer, repro- ductive, and virus cells are not restricted, hav-ing a seemingly infinite doubling potential, andare thus immortal cell lines. This is because theyhave telomerase, which adds back DNA to theends of the chromosomes. One reason for theHayflick phenomenon may be that chromosometelomeres become reduced in length with everycell division and eventually become too short toallow further division. When telomeres are tooshort, the gene notes this and causes the cell todie or apoptosize. Shay and Wright (2001) sug-gest that telomerase-induced manipulations oftelomere length are important to study to definethe underlying genetic diseases and those ge-netic pathways that lead to cancer. Although it is unknown what initial event triggers apoptosis, it is generally acknowledgedthat apoptosis is the mechanism of cell death(Thompson, 1995). Increased cell apoptosis ratesdo cause organ dysfunction, and this is hypoth-esized to be the underlying basis of the path-ophysiology of multiple organ dysfunction(MODS) (Papathanassoglou, Moynihan, &Ackerman, 2000). Gene/Biological Clock TheoryThis theory explains that each cell, or perhapsthe entire organism, has a genetically pro-grammed aging code that is stored in the organ-ism's DNA. Slagboom and associates (Slagboom,Bastian, Beekman, Wendendorf, & Meulenbelt,2000) describe this theory as comprising geneticinfluences that predict physical condition, oc-currence of disease, cause and age of death, andother factors that contribute to longevity. A significant amount of research has been done on circadian rhythms and their influenceon sleep, melatonin , and aging (Ahrendt, 2000; Moore, 1997; Richardson & Tate, 2000). Theserhythms are defined as patterns of wakefulnessand sleep that are integrated into the 24-hoursolar day (Porth, 2002). The everyday rhythm ofthis cycle of sleep-wake intervals is part of atime-keeping framework created by an internalclock. Research has demonstrated that peoplewho do not have exposure to time cues such assunlight and clocks will automatically havesleep and wake cycles that include approxi-mately 23.5 to 26.5 hours (Moore, Czeisler, &Richardson, 1983). This clock seems to be con-trolled by an area in the hypothalamus calledthe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that islocated near the third and the opticchiasm. The SCN, given its anatomical location,does receive light and dark input from theretina, and demonstrates high neuronal firingduring the day and low firing at night. TheSCN is connected to the pituitary gland,explaining the diurnal regulation of growth hor-mone due to the linkage with28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 71 72 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging the hypothalamus, autonomic nervous system,and brain stem reticular formation, diurnalchanges in metabolism, body temperature, andheart rate and blood pressure are explained(Porth, 2002). It is thought that biologicalrhythms lose some rhythmicity with aging. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland and is considered to be the hormone linked tosleep and wake cycles because there are largenumbers of melatonin receptors in the SCN.Researchers have studied the administration ofmelatonin to humans and found a shift in hu-mans' circadian rhythm similar to that causedby light (Ahrendt, 2000). The sleep-wake cyclechanges with aging, producing more fragmentedsleep, which is thought to be due to decreasedlevels of melatonin. This theory indicates that there may be genes that trigger youth and general well-being as wellas other genes that accelerate cell deterioration.Why do some people have gray hair in their late20s and others live to be 60 or beyond beforegraying occurs? It is known that melanin is dam-aged with ultraviolet light and is the ingredientthat keeps human skin resilient and unwrinkled.People who have extensive sun exposure havewrinkles earlier in life due to damage of collagenand elastin. But why, if we know that people havea programmed gene or genes that trigger aging,wouldn't we prevent the gene(s) from causing theproblems they are intending to promote? For example, hypertension, arthritis, hearing loss, and heart disease are among the most com-mon chronic illnesses among older adults(Cobbs, Duthie, & Murphy, 1999). Each of thesediseases has a genetic component to it. So if thehealth care profession can screen people whenthey are younger before they develop symptomsof target organ disease due to hypertension, lossof cartilage and hearing, and aspects of systolicand diastolic dysfunction, it is possible for peo-ple to live longer without experiencing theproblems connected to these chronic illnesses. This knowledge being acquired from the genome theory is greatly impacting the possi-bility of being able to ward off aging and disease. Studies of tumor suppressor gene replacement,prevention of angiogenesis with tumor growth,and regulation of programmed cell death are inprocess (Daniel & Smythe, 2003). Parr (1997) andHaq (2003) cite that caloric restriction extendsmammalian life. By restricting calories there is adecreased need for insulin exposure, which con-sequently decreases growth factor exposure. Bothinsulin and growth factor are related to mammals'genetically determined clock controlling life span.So there is more evidence supportive of agingbeing influenced by key pathways such as theinsulin-like growth factor path (Haq, 2003).Neuroendocrine TheoryThis theory describes a change in hormone secre-tion, such as with the releasing hormones of thehypothalamus and the stimulating hormones ofthe pituitary gland, which manage the thyroid,parathyroid, and adrenal glands, and how theyinfluence the aging process. The following majorhormones are involved with aging: Estrogen decreases thinning of bones, and when women age less estrogen isproduced by the ovaries. As womengrow older and experience menopause,adipose tissue becomes the major sourceof estrogen. Growth hormone is part of the process that increases bone and muscle strength.Growth hormone stimulates the releaseof insulin-like growth factor producedby the liver.28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 72 Biological Theories of Aging 73 Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and is thought to be responsiblefor coordinating seasonal adaptations inthe body. There is a higher chance of excess or loss of glu-cocorticoids, aldosterone, androgens, triiodo-thyronine, thyroxine, and system is altered. When thestimulating and releasing hormones of the pitu-itary and the hypothalamus are out of synchwith the endocrine glands, an increase in diseaseis expected in multiple organs and systems. Ofsignificance are the findings of Rodenbeck andHajak (2001), who cite that with physiologicalaging and also with certain psychiatric disordersthere is increased activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which causes increasedplasma cortisol levels. The increased cortisol lev-els can be linked with several diseases. Holzenberger, Kappeler, and Filho (2004) cite that by inactivating insulin receptors in theadipose tissue of mice, the life span of the miceincreases because less insulin exposure occurs.This further supports that the neuroendocrinesystem is connected to life span regulation.Thyagarajan and Felten (2002) suggest that asone ages there is a loss of neuroendocrine trans-mitter function that is related to the cessation ofreproductive cycles as well as the developmentof mammary and pituitary tumors.Immunologic/Autoimmune TheoryThis theory was proposed 40 years ago and saysthat the normal aging process of humans andanimals is related to faulty immunological func-tion (Effros, 2004). There is a decreased immunefunction in the elderly. The thymus glandshrinks in size and ability to function. Thymushormone levels are decreased at the age of 30and are undetectable by the age of 60 (Williams,1995). Involution of the thymus gland generallyoccurs at about 50 years. The elderly are moresusceptible to infections as well as cancers.There is a loss of T-cell differentiation so thatthe body incorrectly perceives old, irregular cellsas foreign bodies and attacks them. There is also an increase in certain auto- antibodies such as rheumatoid factor and a lossof interleukins. Some think that this changeincreases the chance of the older adult develop-ing an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoidarthritis. Concurrently, resistance to tumor cellsdeclines as one ages (Williams, 1995). Olderadults are more prone to infection such aswound and respiratory infections, as well as tonosocomial infections if they are hospitalized. Venjatraman and Fernandes (1997) cite that active and healthy older adults who participatedin endurance exercises had a significantly in-creased natural killer cell function that, in turn,caused increased cytokine production and en-hanced T cell function, which improves generalwell-being. In contrast, those not exercising seea loss of immunological function as they age.The idea that increased exercise causes newgrowth of muscle fibers is not new, but that italso causes an increased immunological func-tion, sense of well-being, and general health issignificant. So it is supportive of the fact thatthere is a combination of factors that influencethe prevention or, in some cases, the promotionof aging. Also important to note is that thereshould be a balance of exercising and restingbecause overdoing exercise can lead to injuries,and this would support the wear and tear theoryof aging. Table 3-2 summarizes the major theories of aging originating from a biological perspective.28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 73 74 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging It seems that no one theory fully describes theetiology of aging. However, the gene theory andfree radical theory seem to have the most support. Implications for Nursing For many years, nursing has incorporated psy-chosocial theories such as Erikson's personalitydevelopment theory into its practice (Erikson,1963). Psychological theories enlighten usabout the developmental tasks and challengesfaced by older adults and the importance offinding and accepting meaning in one's life.From sociologists, nursing has learned how sup-port systems, functionality, activity and roleengagement, cohorts, and societal expectationscan influence adjustment to aging and life sat-isfaction. These broadly generalized theories,however, lack the specificity and holistic per-spective needed to guide nursing care of olderadults who have varied needs and come fromdifferent settings and sociocultural backgrounds. In a quest for a theoretical framework to guide caregiving in nursing homes, Wadensten(2002) and Wadensten and Carlsson (2003)studied 17 nursing theories that were generatedfrom the 1960s to the 1990s and found thatnone of the theorists discussed what aging is nordid the theorists offer advice on how to applytheir theory to caring for the older adult.Wadensten wrote that existing \"nursing theo-ries do not provide guidance on how to care forolder people or on how to support them in thedevelopmental process of aging. There is a needto develop a nursing care model that, more thancontemporary theories, takes human aging intoTable 3-2 Biological Theories of Aging Theory DescriptionStochastic Theories Based on random events that cause cellular damage that accumulates as theorganism ages. Free radical theory Membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins are damaged by free radicals, which causes cellular injury and aging. Orgel/error theory Errors in DNA and RNA synthesis occur with aging.Wear & tear theory Cells wear out and cannot function with aging.Connective tissue/ With aging, proteins impede metabolic processes and cause trouble withcross-link theory getting nutrients to cells and removing cellular waste products. Nonstochastic Theories Based on genetically programmed events that cause cellular damage thataccelerates aging of the organism. Programmed theory Cells divide until they are no longer able to, and this triggers apoptosis or cell death. Gene/biological Cells have a genetically programmed aging code. clock theoryNeuroendocrine theory Problems with the hypothalamus-pituitary-endocrine gland feedback system cause disease; increased insulin growth factor accelerates aging. Immunological theory Aging is due to faulty immunological function, which is linked to general well-being.28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 74 Implications for Nursing 75 Nursing's goal is to maximize functioning andminimize dependency to improve the safety andquality of living (Miller). Functional consequences theory assumes that quality of life is integrated with functional capac-ity and dependency needs, and that positiveconsequences are possible despite age-related lim-itations. In addition to those experiencing nega-tive functional consequences, Miller (1990)applies her theory to highly functioning olderadults as well as to adult caregivers. She distin-guishes the focus and goal of nursing interven-tions in varied settings (inpatient, outpatient,acute or long-term care); thus, it can be used inmany settings. Interventions are broadly inter-preted as those of nurses, other health careproviders, older adults, or significant others;therefore, this theory may be useful in otherhealth care disciplines. This theory was used tocreate an assessment tool for the early detectionof hospitalized elderly patients experiencing acuteconfusion and to prevent further complications(Kozak-Campbell & Hughes, 1996). Furthertesting is needed to determine the utility of thefunctional consequences theory in other settings. Theory of ThrivingThe theory of thriving (Haight et al., 2002) isbased on the concept of failure to thrive andBergland and Kirkevold's (2001) application of Table 3-3 Nursing Theories of Aging Theory DescriptionFunctional consequences theory Environmental and biopsychosocial consequences impact function- ing. Nuring's role is risk reduction to minimize age-associated dis-ability in order to enhance safety and quality of living. Theory of thriving Failure to thrive results from a discord between the individual and his or her environment or relationships. Nurses identify and mod- ify factors that contribute to disharmony among these elements.consideration\" (2002, p. 119). Others concurthat nursing needs to develop more situation-specific theories of aging to guide practice(Bergland & Barba,Tesh, & Courts, Putnam,2002). Two new theories, the functional conse-quences theory (Miller, 1990) and the theory ofthriving (Haight et al., 2002) are nurse auth-ored and attempt to address this need. Nursing Theories of Aging Functional Consequences TheoryFunctional consequences theory ( Table 3-3 ) was developed to provide a guiding framework thatwould address older adults with physical impair-ment and disability (Miller, 1990). Miller's theoryborrows from several nursing and non-nursingtheories sys-tems theory; (1982) person-environmentfit; and Rose and Killien's (1983) conceptual workdefining risk and vulnerability. Miller asserts thataging adults experience environmental and bio-psychosocial consequences that impact their func-tioning. The nurse's role is to assess for age-relatedchanges and accompanying risk factors, and todesign interventions directed toward risk reduc-tion and minimizing age-associated disability.28438_CH03_057_084.qxd 6/6/06 5:07 PM Page 75 76 Chapter 3: Theories of Aging gaining weight, approximately 14 pounds,since his wife was first diagnosed with can-cer about 2 1/2years ago.

They dis-cuss the concept in three contexts: an outcomeof growth and development, a psychologicalstate, and an expression of physical health state.Failure to thrive first appeared in the aging lit-erature as a diagnosis for older adults with vaguesymptoms such as fatigue, cachexia, and gener-alized weakness (Campia, Berkman, & Fulmer,1986). Other disciplines later defined undernu-trition, physical and cognitive dysfunction, anddepression as its major attributes (Braun, Wykle,& Cowling, 1988). In their concept analysis offailure to thrive, Newbern and Krowchuk (1994)identified prob-lems in social relatedness (disconnectedness andinability to find meaning in life, give of oneselfor attach to others) and physical/cognitive dys-function (consistent unplanned weight loss,signs of depression, and cognitive decline). Haight and colleagues (2002) view thriving in a holistic, life span perspective that considers theimpact of environment as people age. They assertthat thriving is achieved when there is harmonybetween a person and his or her physical environ-ment and personal relationships. Failure to thriveis due to discord among these three elements.Nurses caring for patients can use this theory toidentify factors that may impede thriving andplan interventions to address these concerns.

Until nursing has a comprehensivetheoretical framework to guide its practice thatis tested with diverse patients in varied settings,there remains much that can be useful from thetheories of other disciplines. From the stochasticand programmed biological theories of aging,nurses can better manage nutrition, inconti-nence, sleep rhythms, immunological response,catecholamine surges, hormonal and electrolytebalance, and drug efficacy for older adults withchronic illnesses. Using psychosocial aging the-ories, nurses can assist both the older adult andhis or her family in recognizing that the life theyhave lived has been one of integrity and mean-ing and facilitate peaceful death with dignity.Ego integrity contributes to older adults' well-being and reduces the negative psychologicalconsequences that are often linked to chronic ill-ness and older age. Finally, being cognizant ofolder adults' socioeconomic resources will assistthe nurse and older adult in planning cost-effective best practices to improve symptommanagement and treatment outcomes. Using knowledge gained from aging theo- ries, nurses can assist people to: Use their genetic makeup to prevent co-morbidities Facilitate best practices for managing chronic illnesses Maximize individuals' strengths relative to maintaining independence Facilitate creative ways to overcome individuals' challenges Assist in cultivating and maintaining older adults' cognitive status andmental health. In conclusion, aging continues to be ex- plained from multiple theoretical perspectives.Collectively, these theories reveal that aging is acomplex phenomenon still much in need ofresearch. How one ages is a result of biopsy-chosocial factors. Nurses can use this knowledgeas they plan and implement ways of promotinghealth care to all age groups. As in other disci-plines, the state of the science on aging is rap-idly growing within the nursing profession.Nursing is developing a rich body of knowledgeregarding the care of older adults. Programs andmaterials developed by the Hartford Institutefor Geriatric Nursing, the End of Life NursingCare Consortium, the American Association ofColleges of Nursing, and the Mather Instituteprovide a strong foundation for developing anddisseminating our current knowledge. Nursingresearch must continue to span all facets ofgerontology so that new information will begenerated for improved patient outcomes. Box 3-4 Recommended Reading Goldsmith, T. (2003).

Why shouldshe engage in the lifestyle changes her nurse is recommending? 2. Your 82-year-old patient, Rodney Whitishing, has been healthy most of his life and now is experiencing, for the second winter in a row, an extremely severe case of influenza.He has never taken a flu shot as a preventive measure because he felt he was very strongand healthy.

John uses oxygen at home,but states that he is afraid to walk more than a few steps or show any emotion becausehe will become unable to get enough air. John tells you that he feels his life is not worthliving. Using the theories of aging, how might you respond to this situation? Personal Reflections 1. Develop a philosophy of how theories of aging can support or refute the idea of catego- rizing people in the young-old, middle-old, and old-old classifications according tochronological age. What other characteristics could be used to categorize people as theyage? Give an example of how you would perceive a relative or friend of yours who is inthe sixth or seventh decade of life. 2.

Through our ability to communicate, weexpress our needs and wishes, understand others'needs and wishes, negotiate adversity, and conveyour feelings to others. Losing our ability to com-municate effectively compromises our ability tofunction independently. As an example, imagineyourself in a foreign train station trying to find away to get to the nearest hotel. You are trying toask for directions but no one understands whatyou say or even worse than that . . . you moveyour lips but there is no sound. You would be leftto determine another way to reach your goal, butthe method would be far more complicated thanif you were simply able to say, \"Where is the near-est hotel?\" This example underscores the impor-tance of communication, and how changes in theability to communicate may require special adap-tation and can be anxiety provoking. Communication is composed of a number of physiological processes, specifically, listening,speaking, gesturing, reading, writing, touching,and moving. It also involves cognitive processessuch as attention, memory, self-awareness,organization, and reasoning. In this chapter, wewill provide: 1) an overview of the sensorymodalities involved in communication, 2) anoverview of the role of the brain in communi-cation, and 3) information about normal andpathological changes associated with aging andtheir impact on communication. Sensory Modalities Involved in Communication We receive information through our senses.Approximately 70% of all sensory informationcomes through the eyes (Springhouse, 2001).Thus, vision has an important role in commu-nication. In face-to-face interactions, we usevisual information to make sense of the interac-tion. Visual information provides us importantcontext with which to interpret the communi-cation. For example, being asked to move to theother side of the street likely will be interpreteddifferently if conveyed by a neighbor rather thana police officer. Furthermore, gestures and othernonverbal behaviors, such as a smile, an eyeblink, or tears, allow us to decipher the emo-tional tone of an interaction. In addition to theuse of visual information in face-to-face interac-tions, we rely heavily on visual information inother modes of communication. Books, news-papers, television, computers, and traffic signsare all common modalities that use visual meth-ods for communication. Hearing is another prominent sense that is involved in the reception of communication. Wereceive auditory information through our ears.A major source of communication is the contentof auditory verbal information that is conveyedin conversations as well as via radio, television,or computers. In addition, we heavily rely onnonverbal auditory information. For example,we pay attention to the physical properties ofthe sound, such as pitch (how high or low a tonesounds) and timber (the quality of the sound)that tell us whether a person is angry or whim-sical, young or old, healthy or sick. Nonverbalauditory information also plays an importantrole in communication. For example, hearing acar engine tells us that a car is coming, or hear-ing a certain melody in a movie tells us that thekiller may be approaching the scene. Other sensory modalities may not seem as important for communication. However, touchmay be used as a substitute for other senses. Forexample, a person with a poor sense of visionmay rely on touch to \"read\" his or her environ-28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 88 The Role of the Brain in Communication 89 ment. Light touch initiated by others can con-vey the presence of someone who cares for you.The chemical senses of smell ( olfaction ) and taste ( gustation ) also seem to be unrelated to communication. Yet, we give chocolate to ourloved ones on Valentine's Day and wear ourfavorite perfume when we go out with peoplewe like. When other sensory modalities areabsent, olfaction and gustation might capture agreater role in our life, because they may serveas the major mechanisms of communication. Movement provides us with important infor- mation about our environment. For some,movement combined with the sense of touchallows them to receive information from theenvironment. Orienting oneself toward thesource of communication is yet another way inwhich movement improves our ability to receiveinformation from our environment. Last, inaddition to its role in the actual articulation ofverbal information, movement allows us to con-vey meaning by the use of nonverbal gesturesand facial expressions. Speech is the primary form of communicating with our environment. Speech is a very complexprocess that requires sensory input, motor outputto both facial and vocal muscles, and central pro-cessing that takes place in multiple brain locations(Beers & Berkow, 2004). Speech involves botharticulation and pronunciation and is distin-guished from language, which involves the actualselection of words and the integration of wordsinto sentences. In contrast to speech, language canbe either written or spoken as well as either ver-bal or nonverbal (Finlayson & Heffer, 2000). Cog-nitive issues such as those that occur withdementia, or psychological factors such as fear ofexpressing one's opinion, may also impact speech. Last, disability (physical impairment) may not have a direct effect on our ability to com-municate and may not result in a sensory deficit.However, it might result in other people mod-ifying their style of communication towards dis-abled older adults and, thus, will be brieflydiscussed in this chapter. The Role of the Brain in Communication The brain has a major role in attending to newinformation, making sense of and organizinginformation, and deciding on a response. Theinformation we receive through our senses is notan exact representation of the real world. Ournervous system is limited in its ability to receiveinformation from the physical world. For exam-ple, our hearing is limited to frequencies of 20 to20,000 hertz and our vision is limited to a wave-length of 400 to 700 nanometers. Thus, we maybe completely oblivious to stimuli that exceedthese physical characteristics. In addition, ourbrain is set to respond to change rather than tocontinuity and, thus, tends to adapt by respond-ing at a slower rate after a stimulus is presentedfor a while. This may result in perceiving certainstimuli as more intense just because of their nov-elty. Last, we tend to perceive incomplete infor-mation as complete and recognizable, becausethis is more efficient, less ambiguous, and makesbetter sense for us (Atrens & Curthoys, 1978;Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2005). The cortex is a large, wrinkly sheet of neu- rons that covers the brain. The cortex containsall the sensory and motor information as well asour thoughts. Information that is perceivedthrough our sensory system goes to the thala-mus, a relay station in the center of our brain. It is then transferred via neurons into the sensorycortex. The sensory area of the cortex is locatedon a vertical strip near the center of the skull.Sensory information is represented on this strip28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 89 90 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication in relation to the sensitivity of each body part,and not in relation to its actual size. For exam-ple, the tongue is very sensitive and thus, cap-tures a large area of the sensory cortex despite itsrelatively small size. From the sensory cortex,information is sent to higher-order parts of thebrain, such as the forebrain. These areas inte-grate the sensory information and interpret itbased on past experiences, overall arousal level,and the array of sensory information alreadyavailable to us (Atrens & Curthoys, 1978;Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2005). When one or more sensory systems do not function, our brain compensates by relying onother sensory modalities for information. Forexample, Helen Keller lost her vision and hear-ing at 19 months of age. Yet, she was able todevelop an extraordinary sense of touch thatallowed her to communicate with the world(Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2005).Although the brain is more adaptable at such ayoung age, even older adults may use one modal-ity to replace other modalities that functioninadequately. For example, an older adult whohas lost the ability to see might be able to learnhow to use touch to \"read\" books written inBraille. Similarly, in the case of neurodegenera-tive diseases such as dementia , when the brain's ability to understand information and to com-municate verbally deteriorates, older adults mayresort to alternative forms of communication. Normal and Pathological Age-RelatedChanges That Affect Communication Sensory changes are common with aging. TheU.S. Census Bureau reported that of the 33 mil-lion noninstitutionalized elders over the age of65 surveyed, 14% had some type of sensorydeficit (Waldrop & Stern, 2003). This numberincreases with age, with 35% of people aged 85and older reporting a sensory disability. We willnow provide a discussion of aging-relatedchanges in the sensory system as well as in cog-nitive and psychological functioning. Not allage-related changes are \"normal\" and expected.Some are the result of pathological processesthat are more likely to take place at old age.Thus, for each sensory modality, we also willdiscuss pathological changes that are commonin older adults. These will be followed by a dis-cussion of the impact of these changes on com-munication. Table 4-1 provides a concise summary of this section. Vision Typical Age-Related Changes in the Eye The Lens. With age, the lens changes in color, becoming more yellowed or amber, andmore opaque. This makes it difficult for theaging eye to distinguish colors in the blue-greenhue range. The lens becomes flattened, denser,and less flexible (Gray, 1995), the result ofwhich is that the lens's ability to accommodate(adjust focus) is compromised (Kline & Scialfa,1996). These changes begin after the age of 40and impact our ability to see certain colors,focus on objects, and so on. The Iris and Pupil. Starting at the age of 50, the pupillary reflex responds more slowly, and thepupil does not dilate completely (the size of thepupil decreases), making it more difficult to seein lower light, thus older adults adapt to the darkless quickly. The pupil contracts less quickly aswell, which makes it more difficult to deal withsudden illumination such as when walking fromindoors into direct sunlight. By age 60, these28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 90 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 91 Table 4-1 Normal and Pathological Changes and Their Impact on Communication Pathological Impact on Modality Normal Changes Changes Communication VisionHearing Speech andLanguage Touch andbreathy voice, maysound anddecreased towarm or cold Due to decline in manysensory organs, cognitivefunctioning, and bodilystrength; mouth safety might becompromisedReduced ability insecurity,loss of independence,increased risk of falls (continues)28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 91 92 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication changes in the pupil and lens result in a tremen-dous reduction (70%) in the amount of light thatreaches the retina (Pirkl, 1995). Typical Vision ProblemsVision problems are some of the most commonsensory deficits in older adults. Most peopleexperience testable visual losses that are re-vealed during an examination, but are subtleand do not actually impair daily existence dueto the person's ability to compensatorily adapt.The Lighthouse for the Blind (1995) conducteda national survey, \"The Louis Harris Survey,\" todetermine the incidence of visual impairmentsin middle and old age. They found that 17% oftheir sample had visual impairments, and thatthese numbers increase with increasing age.About 95% of adults over the age of 65reported needing glasses to assist with vision.However, the effectiveness of glasses in correct-ing vision decreases with age. It is notable thatin elders over the age of 85, less than half reportthat their glasses corrected all of their visualproblems (AgeWorks, 2000; Ebersole & Hess,2001). According to the Lighthouse survey (1996), people with visual impairments are more likelyto be female, unmarried, of low socioeconomicstatus, and of poor health or with poor access tohealth care. They are also more likely to beminorities. The oldest-old are at the greatestrisk, particularly when they are of low socioeco-nomic status. They are likely to report the sever-est vision impairments.Table 4-1 Normal and Pathological Changes and Their Impact on Communication (CONTINUED ) Pathological Impact on Modality Normal Changes Changes Communication Cognitive Decline in informationprocessing speed, dividedattention, sustainedattention, that of youngeradultsDelirium, dementia;Alzheimer's loss response,difficulty finding newinformationSlowed response, lack ofmotivation, decrease insocial activity28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 92 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 93 Typical vision problems include the following: Poor visual acuity or clarity: Our ability to identify objects (stationary or mov-ing) at a distance declines with age. Presbyopia: Latin for \"old eyes\"\u2014the person cannot focus as clearly whenobjects are up close. These losses occurgradually from childhood, but do nottypically become problematic untilmiddle age, around 40-50, as the lensbegins to lose flexibility. Eyes becomeeasily fatigued. Presbyopia is easily cor-rectible with glasses, and by age 55most people begin to wear glasses on apart-time basis such as when reading. Other problems: These include increased sensitivity to light and glare. Increasedsensitivity to light may lead to excessivewatering of the eyes and blurred vision(National Institute on Aging, 1998).Sometimes the eyes produce too fewtears, which can lead to itching andburning sensations, and sometimesreduce vision. Under conditions ofglare, direct light narrows the visualfield and limits peripheral vision. Theseindividuals are typically blinded bydirect beams of light, thus impairingtheir ability to drive at night. Behavioral Cues to Visual DeficitsWhen people begin to have vision problems,they start to adjust the distance at which theyhold the paper or a book in front of them whenthey read. This is to compensate for loss ofvision for items that are closer in distance.Also common is for people to begin to squintin an attempt to bring far-away items intofocus. Squinting helps cut down on some ofthe visual glare that may be impairing sight.Thus, it may take an aging person several yearsbefore his or her vision deteriorates to thepoint where he or she seeks assessment and/ortreatment. Visual deficits may lead to coordination dif- ficulties in which the person has problems but-toning his or her shirt or finding food on a plate.He or she may have difficultly distinguishing anobject from its background, leading to clumsynavigation of daily activities. This difficulty indistinguishing objects may also result in anolder adult choosing brightly colored objectsover more dull objects because their heightenedcolor contrast helps the older adult distinguishthem (Family Development and Resource Man-agement, 2004).Common Visual Diseases Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD): This disease affects 10% or more of older adults. It usually occursbilaterally and is a leading cause ofblindness in the United States. Neuronsin the center of the retina no longerfunction (due to hardening and block-ing of the retinal arteries) resulting inblurred vision and loss of central vision.Two types of ARMD are wet and dry(see Chapter 11). Diabetic retinopathy: As a long-term effect of diabetes, the blood vessels tothe eyes grow weak and rupture, caus-ing vision loss that may lead to blind-ness. New blood vessels form and \"scartissue may form along these new vessels,pulling on the retina causing maculardistortion and possible retinal detach-ment\" (Springhouse, 2001, p. 1158).28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 93 94 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication Glaucoma: This disease affects 2% of adults over the age of 40 (Springhouse,2001). Glaucoma refers to a collectionof eye disorders characterized by abuildup of viscous fluid (aqueoushumor) in the intraoccular cavity. Themost common type of glaucoma (wide-angle glaucoma) occurs when the nor-mal method of fluid drainage (out of theback of the eye through a small channelknown as the trabecular meshwork)becomes blocked. This buildup of fluidcreates pressure and damages the opticnerve. The cause of this blockage is asyet unknown, but the condition appearsto be heritable. Glaucoma results ingradual loss of vision, and if leftuntreated, can lead to blindness. Senile cataracts: These are most com- monly found in adults over the age of70. It refers to a clouding of the lens,which blocks light reflecting throughthe lens, and can blur the image that isreflected onto the retina, resulting inhazy vision. Cataracts are most likelycaused by changes in the proteinswithin the lens, which can cause blind-ness when severe; however, this can becorrected through surgery (surgicalremoval of the lens), which is effectivein 95% of cases (Eliopoulos, 2005;Springhouse, 2001). Retinal detachment: More common in men than women, this conditionoccurs when the retina separates fromthe back of the eye and fills with vitre-ous fluid. Once separated, it is cut offfrom its blood supply, impairing itsability to function. This may result insevere visual impairment or blindness;however, this is usually correctablethrough surgical reattachment. Inadults, this is typically caused bydegenerative changes in the eye (lead-ing to a torn retina), but may alsoresult from trauma, disease, or intra-occular pressure. The Impact of Visual Deficits on CommunicationDeclining visual skills may result in gradual iso-lation and a decrease in exchange of communi-cation with the environment. As the personbecomes less able to navigate outside of his orher home, he or she may become less sociallyactive. Visual impairment may be a source ofembarrassment to the older adult and serve todecrease the likelihood that he or she willengage in public activities (e.g., eating out in arestaurant, attending social gatherings, etc.) aswell as further his or her isolation. When interacting with older adults with visual problems, it is important to positionobjects within their visual field. This includespositioning yourself within their visual fieldwhen speaking with the person. This helps theperson to locate the object of conversation andto be oriented to the topic of conversation. When assisting elders with their care needs, it may be useful to give them a verbal indicationof the actions you are about to take, to avoidstartling or scaring them needlessly (FamilyDevelopment and Resource Management, 2004).It may be necessary to assist the person in label-ing objects or to simplify what is in their visualfield (e.g., reduce unnecessary clutter). A more extreme situation is the case of visual illusions (distorted perceptions of vision). Dueto the aging eye's decreased elasticity andaccommodation abilities, illusions may occur in28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 94 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 95 the normal functioning brain when informationis misinterpreted, such as seeing a shadow andmisinterpreting it as a person. Other visual mis-perceptions include seeing little flecks or spotsin the visual field when in bright light, or see-ing shadows as people. Visual hallucinationoccurs in the damaged brain. The following isan example of visual illusion: It's mid-afternoon in an adult day care pro- gram, and the filtered afternoon sunlight isshining through the trees and bay window andonto one of the chairs at the table. Ethel, an 82-year-old female with some ambulation difficul-ties, is being escorted to the lunchroom when shestops suddenly and refuses to enter the kitchen.After persuasion and coaxing to enter the roomwere met with denial, Ethel was finally askedwhy she did not want to enter the room. Ethelproclaimed to the staff, \"Look at all that waterspilling from that chair onto the floor!\" Clearly Ethel did not want to enter the room for fear of slipping in the water. If staff were notaware of the possible interaction of her visualdeficits and the low lighting in the environment,it is possible that her refusal to enter the roomcould have been misinterpreted as a behavioralproblem, a symptom of dementia or delirium, orthe presence of some other medical problem. Hearing Typical Age-Related Changes in HearingHearing loss is a commonly observed phenom-enon in older adults and is one of the most com-mon disabilities in the United States. Hearingbegins to decline on average in our 30s and con-tinues more rapidly with age (Pirkl, 1995).Beginning at or around age 50-55, most adultsstart to lose sensitivity to pitch; the very highfrequency consonants (t, p, k, f, s, and ch) arelost first (Scheuerle, 2000). Background noisesuch as the hum of traffic or air conditionersmay drown out voices, making conversationharder to hear. Higher pitched voices may notbe understandable (Springhouse, 2001). Al-though hearing loss can begin or occur in youngpeople, this is not normal hearing loss (Belsky,1999). However, the general pattern is for hear-ing to decline with age, with 20-30% of Amer-icans experiencing a hearing loss over the age of65 years and 40-50% over the age of 75 (Jergeret al., 1995; NIDCD, 2004). Types of Hearing Loss Conductive problems. Sound waves are blocked as they travel from the outer ear canalto the inner ear and, thus, there is a decrease inhearing sensitivity. Conductive loss can becaused by anything that blocks the external ear,but excessive wax (cerumen) buildup is the mostcommon cause of conductive problems (Spring-house, 2001), with nearly one in three olderadults having their hearing reduced by up to35% (AgeWorks, 2000). Other causes of con-duction problems include benign tumors, if leftuntreated, and otosclerosis. Membranes in themiddle ear become less flexible with age. Thesmall bones (ossicles) become stiffer. Sometimesmalformed or fused bones (otosclerosis) can leadto impaired movement of the stapes, thus pre-venting the transmission of sound waves. Thisis twice as likely to occur in women as in men,and usually occurs between adolescence andmiddle age (Springhouse, 2001). Sensorineural problems. Sound wave trans- mission is interrupted from the inner ear to thebrain, most likely due to damage to the cochleaand/or auditory nerve. The most common form28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 95 96 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication of age-r elated hearing loss is called presbycusis (a gradual hearing loss that occurs with advanced age). Presbycusis is typified by problems hear-ing high-pitched tones and a decrease in speechdiscrimination. This occurs due to loss of hairand supporting cells and nerve fibers in thecochlea. Loss of neurons in the cochlea can leadto poor word recognition (Springhouse, 2001).Presbycusis is the fourth ranked chronic dis-ability in older adults (aged 65 and older)(Jerger, Chmiel, Wilson, & Luchi, 1995). Persistent exposure to noise pollution. Not all hearing loss is due to primary aging factors. Aweak tympanic membrane (ear drum) may be-come damaged due to environmental noise orpressure changes. Employment-related damage\u2014in construction workers, racecar drivers or pit crews,people who work in concerts, and combat/hunting-related damage\u2014is a common cause of hearingloss. This type of hearing loss is more likely toaffect men because a larger proportion of men tendto work or engage in these fields. This type of hearing loss can be either tempo- rary or permanent depending on the extent of theexposure. Long-term exposure to environmentalnoise can also result in tinnitis , a condition in which the person experiences a persistent ring-ing, buzzing, humming, roaring, or other noisein the ears that only the person can hear.Exposure to Ototoxic SubstancesSome medications such as aspirin, antibiotics,diuretics, and antidepressants can cause hearingloss or tinnitis. Although some hearing symptomswill reverse when the offending medication iswithdrawn, some losses are typically permanent. Poisons such as arsenic, lead, or mercury are toxic to the inner ear and typically affect theeighth cranial nerve. Exposure to these sub-stances may lead to either temporary or perma-nent hearing loss (Springhouse, 2001).Acute TraumaDamage at the level of the central nervous sys-tem due to head trauma (most likely caused byfalls) can cause hearing loss. If the damage is tothe eighth cranial nerve, then sensorineural losswill be observed. If the damage is to the tem-poral lobe (the cortex), a loss of certain frequen-cies and pitches occurs.Medical ConditionsThe following medical conditions can causehearing loss: Hypertension (treatable cause of tinnitis) Type II diabetes Effects of cigarette smoking Chronic viral or bacterial infections in the middle ear (if untreated) Exposure to measles, mumps, or menin- gitis (can lead to sensorineural deficits) Difficulties Detecting Hearing LossDespite the fact that hearing loss is a commonoccurrence in older adults, it is not routinelyassessed (Tsuruoka et al., 2001). It is estimatedthat only 20% of primary care physicians rou-tinely assess older adults for hearing loss.Compounding this problem is that the patientsthemselves may not be aware of their deficit.This may be due to several factors, includingcompensation, a failure to report due to igno-rance of their condition, and/or embarrassment. People often compensate for mild hearing loss by engaging in such behaviors as turning upthe volume of the television, pretending tounderstand conversation, or attempting to fillin the gaps in conversation by using contextualcues. Missing sounds may not be detected bythe person, and he or she may miss entire eventsand not know it. Thus, it is not surprising thatin studies of hearing loss, some researchers have28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 96 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 97 found that the affected person judges his or herimpairment as less severe than the spouse does(Chmiel & Jerger, 1993). Conversely, because ofsocial stigma and embarrassment, individualsmay not report their hearing loss to others, andinstead may withdraw socially to prevent othersfrom detecting their hearing loss. Older adults who do seek assistance with hearing problems have typically experiencedsome hearing loss for years before seeking help.One estimate of the time between the experi-enced loss and treatment seeking is as high as 10years (Jerger et al., 1995)!Indications of Hearing LossHearing impairment may lead to the followingbehaviors: Inattentiveness and/or inappropriate responses or no response to questions Asking repetitious questions, or asking for things to be repeated An increased reaction to loud sounds Increased or unusually loud speech dur- ing conversation, especially in areaswith some type of background noise Tilting/cocking head toward a sound in an attempt to facilitate hearing Isolation and/or emotional upset as a result of problems in communicatingwith others either in group settings orindividually The Impact of Hearing Deficits on CommunicationHearing loss has adverse effects on multipledomains including cognitive, emotional, behav-ioral, and social functioning. Hearing impair-ment can lead to negative outcomes such asdecreased quality of life, depression, loneliness,impaired communication, and isolation (Jergeret al., 1995). Thus, it is imperative that indi-viduals be assessed and treated. Individuals with hearing loss may have trou- ble functioning independently. They may findit difficult to understand (and therefore follow)their primary care health care provider's advice,and they may be prone to more accidents (diffi-culty responding to warnings or alarms) (Na-tional Institute on Aging, 2004). In addition,mild to moderate hearing loss is more likely tolead to social isolation. This may be related tobecoming frustrated with having to constantlyask others to repeat themselves. This also maybe related to embarrassment over having failedat conversation (Tsuruoka et al., 2001). Con-versely, the social isolation may sometimes bedue to others who may unconsciously stay awayfrom those people with whom it is difficult tohave a conversation. When communicating with a person who presents with hearing impairment, do not shout.Shouting increases the intensity and pitch of thewords, but does not aid in hearing what is beingsaid (Family Development and Resource Man-agement, 2004). Attempt to project your voicefrom your diaphragm (which deepens the tone).Ensure that you are standing in front of the per-son in a well-lit room. This will help to assisthim or her with lip reading. Alert the personthat you are addressing him or her with a lighttouch or visual cue, and wait for him or her tovisually orient to you before speaking. If the per-son has better hearing in one ear, attempt tospeak to that side if possible. If the person wearsa hearing aid, ensure that it is turned on. Usegestures or objects to assist with communication(Family Development and Resource Manage-ment, 2004). Limit background noise. If conversing with a hearing-impaired elder, it is helpful to turn offtelevisions, radios, and air conditioning units28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 97 98 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication that may make it difficult for the person to dis-tinguish voices from the background noise. Make sure to allow adequate time for a re- sponse. Rewording the question may only serveto further confuse the person. It may be morehelpful to use short sentences and speak clearly,taking care to enunciate words (Springhouse,2001). At times, you may have to resort to writ-ing or using a pictogram grid for communica-tion. The use of other modes of communication,such as gestures or touch, also might be helpful. Speech and Language Typical Age-Related Changes in Speech and LanguageWith age, normal changes in speech and lan-guage occur as a result of physiological and cog-nitive changes. Decreased respiration strengthmay cause the voice to become deeper andspeech may become more shaky and breathy. Inaddition, pitch may vary and the voice maysound tremulous as a result of changes to thelaryngeal structure. Some older adults may ex-perience an overproduction of mucous, whichmay result in frequent attempts at throat clear-ing. Reduced saliva, loss of teeth, and decreasedelasticity and muscle tone of the face are alsocommon and may cause changes in articulation.Cognitive changes associated with aging alsomay be responsible for older adults using fewerwords and making more semantic errors thanyounger adults (Beers & Berkow, 2004), butmost speech problems in elders are due to sometype of brain pathology.Pathological Changes in Speech and LanguageChanges in speech or the ability to use languagemay result from disease or injury.Dysarthria is disturbed articulation. It is a result of disturbance in the control ofthe speech muscles. This disturbance iscaused by brain lesions in motor areas inthe central nervous system or the brainstem or disruption in the coordination ofinformation from the basal ganglia, cere-bellum, and motor neurons. Dysarthriacan caused by stroke, brain tumor,degenerative diseases, metabolic diseases,or toxins. The location of the brain lesiondetermines the nature of the disturbance,which can manifest in many ways, withthe most severe form being anarthria(complete inability to move the articula-tors for speech). People with dysarthriamay present with slurred speech, breathi-ness, slow or rapid rate of speech, limitedmouth or facial movement, monotonousvoice, or weak articulation. A person whohas dysarthria may be able to read, write,and gesture normally and comprehensionmay remain intact (Duffy, 1995;Finlayson & Heffer, 2000). Verbal apraxia is a disorder caused by damage primarily to the parietal lobe,which is involved with somatosensoryprocessing. This is a neurological disor-der characterized by impairment in ini-tiation, coordination, and sequencing ofmuscle movement, which results in dif-ficulties executing mouth and speechmovements. People with verbal apraxiahave the intention and the physicalcapacity to move the muscles that areinvolved in speech, but have difficultiesspeaking because of loss of volitionalcontrol over the muscles. This conditionoften accompanies aphasia ( Merck Manual of Geriatrics , 2004). 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 98 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 99 Aphasia is the most common language disorder in the elderly and occurs in upto one third of the patients in an acutephase following stroke (Wade, Hewer,David, & Menderby, 1986). Aphasia isan inability to express or understandthe meaning of words due to damagein the language areas of the brain.Damage is most frequently due tostroke in the left hemisphere, but canbe due to brain tumor, trauma, infec-tion, dementia, or surgery. In additionto spoken language, writing, reading,and the ability to gesture also may beimpaired. Receptive (fluent) aphasia ischaracterized by the inability to com-prehend spoken or written language,but intact expressive ability. However,although the production of speech isintact, the meaning of spoken lan-guage is severely distorted and wordsdo not hang together. This is a resultof damage to Wernicke's area in thebrain, which is responsible for themeaning of language. Expressive (non-fluent) aphasia is characterized by theinability to produce language in eitheran oral or a written form, but relativelyintact language comprehension. Theperson produces very few effortfulwords, short sentences, and manypauses. This aphasia is due to damageto Broca's area, which is in charge ofspeech production. In most cases, how-ever, a combination of deficits existsand aphasia is never purely expressiveor receptive. Global aphasia is the mostsevere form of aphasia and is character-ized by severe impairment in the pro-duction of recognizable words as wellas in the understanding of spoken lan-guage (Duffy, 1995; Finlayson &Heffer, 2000). Other medical conditions may also result in impairment in speech. For example: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is a common condition inolder adults that is characterized byblockage of airflow in the lungs.Speech is likely to be low and pitch-restricted in range. Because of frequentcoughing and dyspnea, people mayalso present with chronic hoarseness(Duffy, 1995). Some older adults may require support by mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure. Those who requiremechanical ventilation often need to communicate by an alternative meanssuch as a communication board. Using an electrolarynx, which is a voice box that produces sounds based on airvibrations, may be used by laryngectomypatients or others wo have had throatsurgery affecting the voice. Another medical procedure that affects communication is laryngectomy. Thisis an operation where a portion or all ofthe larynx is removed, as is used intreating patients with laryngeal orhypopharyngeal cancers. After totallaryngectomy, patients can no longeruse their own voice. Instead, writing,mouthing words, gesturing, or an electrolarynx may be used. A surgicalprocedure to restore speech can also beperformed, but this requires someadditional practice and adaptation(Duffy, 1995).28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 99 100 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication The Impact of Speech and LanguageDeficits on CommunicationIt is important to keep in mind that deficits inspeech and/or language are not necessarily globaland are likely to vary from person to person. Forexample, one person may not be able to producespoken language, but will have no difficulties incomprehending language, whereas another per-son may have deficits in both comprehension andproduction of language. Our interactions should,of course, be adapted according to the specificneeds and deficits of the elderly. from the mechanical ventilation. Shestill has a Foley catheter, which sherefuses to let go, saying that she \"cannotbe without it.\"Questions: 1. What are some of the potential challenges for communicating withMrs. Schmidt? 2. How would you assess for these challenges? 3. What are some of the potential explanations for the communica-tion difficulties described in thisvignette? 4. Is there anything that should have been done differently? 5. How would you explain Mrs. Schmidt's miraculous ability towean? 6. How would you explain Mrs. Schmidt's refusal to \"let go\" of theFoley catheter?Mrs. Schmidt is a 64-year-old wo- man who has been staying at an acutecare facility for over 3 months. She hasbeen suffering for several years fromchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseand was placed on mechanical ventila-tion last fall. She was initially admittedto your facility for a weaning trial fromthe mechanical ventilator. For the past3 months, she had failed several trialsof weaning. Last night, the physicianinformed her that she was to leave theacute facility, connected to the mechan-ical ventilation, and that no further tri-als would be initiated. This morning,you ask Mrs. Schmidt about her prep-arations for leaving the facility. Inresponse, Mrs. Schmidt starts cryingdramatically and asks to see the attend-ing physician. She is extremely upset,stating that \"no one had told her any-thing about this.\" She is adamantly ask-ing for an extension of her stay and foranother weaning trial. Two weeks later,Mrs. Schmidt is completely weaned Case Study 4-128438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 100 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 101 People with speech or language difficulties might be more anxious or self-aware when com-municating and, thus, an environment that is lowin distractions and that allows the elderly to feelrelaxed might be helpful. Position yourself inclose proximity to the elderly person, and facehim or her so that eye contact is maintained andfacial expressions and body language are easilyconveyed. In addition, be open and prepared tousing multiple forms of communication, such asbody language, writing, or pictorial information.Using short uncomplicated sentences that offersimple choices may also be helpful. Rephrasingand using physical demonstrations can be help-ful for those who have comprehension difficulties. In cases when speech production is impaired, summarizing the message in order to check foraccuracy may be helpful. It also is important notto correct every error and to respect the elder'slimitations. Be patient and accepting even whencommunication takes time and effort. Touch Touch, pressure, vibration, pain, and tempera-ture are sensations that we receive through ourskin and are part of the somatosensory system . The skin responds to external stimuli, which arethen interpreted by the brain as softness, pain,or heat. Research has demonstrated that despitewide variability across individuals, there is areduction in tactile and vibration sensations aswell as decreased sensitivity to warm or coldstimuli as we age (Kenshalo, 1986; Stevens &Patterson, & Boulton,1993; Thornbury & Mistretta, 1981). Reducedtouch sensitivity is more prevalent in the fin-gertips than in other locations, such as the fore-arm and lip (Stevens & Patterson, 1995). Reduction in somatosensory sensitivity has been attributed to reduction in the number ofreceptors and to a reduction in the blood flow tothe receptors that occur as we age (Gescheider,Beiles, Checkosky, Bolanowski, & Verrillo,1994; Verrillo, older adults presentwith somatosensory deficits, and certain medicalconditions associated with aging, such as demen-tia, diabetes, arthritis, and Parkinson's disease,may exacerbate changes information plays an impor- tant role in assuring our safety. For example, theexperiences of pain or heat alert us to change ourposition in the environment, to avoid certain sit-uations, or to change the environment alto-gether. Reduced somatosensory sensitivity in theelderly has been associated with an increase ininjuries, such as hypothermia (a dangerously lowbody temperature), burns, or pressure ulcers(reddened skin that breaks down and is causedby lack of blood flow and mechanical stress tothe skin). Reduced tactile perception also hasbeen associated with postural instability andwith the difficulties of older adults to positionand orient their bodies in space (Corriveau,Hebert, Raiche, Dubois, & Prince, 2004; Toshiakiet al., 1995).The Impact of Somatosensory Deficits on CommunicationWhen older adults present with injuries, it isimportant not to interpret the injuries as inten-tional or abuse in nature, but instead to try toidentify alternative means to communicate thevery essential somatosensory information. Forexample, teaching older adults to read the ther-mostat in order to detect the water temperaturemight help those with somatosensory deficits28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 101 102 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication to notice excessive hot or cold temperature.Encouraging older adults to move out of theirchair frequently can prevent pressure ulcers. Some older adults might grasp objects tightly or use their mouth to explore the qual-ity of objects. It is important to recognize thatthese behaviors might be a result of sensorydeficits, where the mouth becomes a tool formaking sense of the world. It might be useful todescribe the objects verbally or pictorially andto allow the person to explore them using allmeans (as long as this does not pose a danger tothe individual). When engaging in physical activity with older adults, it is important to use verbal expla-nations to describe the physical activities as theytake place. It also is important to assure gripbefore releasing the older adult. Some older adults may completely avoid tac- tile sensations because of their deficits. Whenolder adults avoid activities that require touch,such as sewing or painting, you might want toencourage them to revert to activities that cap-italize on strengths and abilities they havemaintained; for example, encouraging olderadults to sing or read. Movement Movement is an important ability that fostersindependence and promotes interaction and un-derstanding of the environment (Wang, Badley,& Gignac, 2004). Movement is a function ofmany variables, such as posture, balance, flexi-bility, tone, strength, sensory integration, re-flexes, and motor planning. Movement producedby the large muscle groups is called gross motor movement , and movement produced by the small muscle groups is called fine motor move- ment . Research has shown that both gross and fine motor movements are affected by the agingprocess, aging-related diseases, and a sedentarylifestyle associated with aging. In general, as weage, movement is characterized by reduced veloc-ity (speed) and accuracy and greater variabilityacross individuals Welford, 1982). Movement Disorders in Older AdultsParkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurode-generative condition that is characterized byimpairment in the nerves that control move-ment. This is a progressive disease that affectsthe basal ganglia in the brain. People with PDhave a shortage of dopamine. It is not clear,however, what causes Parkinson's disease. Themajor symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidityand stiffness, slowness of movement, posturalinstability, and/or impaired balance and coordi-nation. Other symptoms may include memoryproblems, depression, hallucination, and mildvision loss. The course and rate of progressionvary. Currently, there is no cure for PD.However, medications that increase the presenceof dopamine in the brain improve some of thesymptoms of PD (Ebersole & Hess, 1998). The Impact of Parkinson's Disease on Com- munication. Although the course of PD varies and deficits are not uniformly present, this con-dition is likely to impair communication in avariety of ways: Speech may become more slurred, soft, hoarse, or have an inappropriaterhythm. Writing may become smaller, shaky, and difficult to read. Facial expressions may be lost. Thus, the presence of PD may impact the abilityto communicate verbally as well as nonverbally.28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 102 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 103 Disability Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily LivingActivities of daily living (ADLs) are basic tasks that one needs to perform in order to survive.These include, eating, bathing, toileting, trans-ferring, and grooming. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are more complex tasks that include handling finances, preparing meals,or managing one's medications. Because of theirbasic nature, impairments are consideredmore severe than ADLs andIADLs are often used to assess functioning.Impairment (deviation from the norm) inADLs/IADLs is most prevalent among the el-derly. It is estimated that about 26% of peoplebetween the ages of 65 and 74 report functionallimitations, whereas almost 50% of people overthe age of 75 report such limitations. Researchhas shown that 14% of older adults have ADLlimitations and as many as 21% of older adultshave impairment in IADLs (Administration onAging, 2002). The rates of unmet needs associ-ated with ADL impairments are very high.Unfortunately, research has shown that as manyas 20% of those who had at least one ADLimpairment did not receive adequate assistanceto meet their needs (Allen & Mor, 1997; Desai,Lentzner, & Weeks, 2001). Risk Factors for Impairment in ADL/IADL. In addition to age, other risk factors forADL/IADL impairment include being female(Collison, Cicuttini, Mead, & (Hebert, 1993),the presence of a et al.,1999), lack of exercise (Stessman, Hammerman-Rozenberg, Maaravi, & Cohen, 2002), depres-sion (Han, 2002), subjective health problems(Collison et al., 1999), and low socioeconomicstatus (Kaplan et al., 1993). Research has shownthat the trajectory of ADL changes across timeis highly individualized. A steep decline in ADLfunctioning can be a predictor of serious med-ical or cognitive problems. The majority of el-ders remain relatively unchanged in their ADLfunctioning (Li, 2005). Measuring ADL/IADL. Measures of ADL/ IADL have become increasingly popular becausethese are very sensitive indicators of hospitalstay, nursing home placement, and mortality(Reuben, Rubenstein, Hirsch, & Hays, 1992).Most of the time, the presence or absence of amedical diagnosis would be less indicative thanADL/IADL functioning. Thus, informationabout ADL/IADL functioning can be used notonly as a prognostic tool, but also to determinethe person's level of need for care. Additionally,information about ADL/IADL can assist in set-ting realistic goals for treatment, developing anappropriate treatment plan, and monitoringchange over time. Both ADLs and IADLs have their limitations as indicators of functional impairment. ADLsare very basic and, thus, may not be sensitiveenough to capture less severe disability. SomeIADLs tend to be gender specific (e.g., cookinga meal) and, thus, not applicable to the entirepopulation, especially in the older cohort thatobeys more traditional gender role standards. Self-report measures of ADL/IADL are easy to use and require no prior training. However,research has shown that older adults often over-estimate their abilities, whereas family mem-bers underestimate their loved one's abilities(Rubenstein et al., 1988). Furthermore, physi-cians were found to be poor judges of ADL/IADL (Elam et al., 1989). To complicate things,28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 103 104 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication simple changes in the wording of questionnaireitems resulted in major differences in prevalenceestimates of functional disability (Picavet & vande Bos, 1996). Direct observation of one's performance is considered to be more objective and replicable.However, it is important to consider the levelof motivation when judging someone's func-tioning level. Additionally, performance-basedmeasures may assess tasks that are irrelevant tothe everyday life of the elderly. Thus, a combi-nation of self-report and direct observation iswarranted. Compensating for ADL/IADL Impairments. Depending on the impairment in ADL/IADL,one might use assistive devices such as a calen-dar or a pill organizer to overcome difficulties inmanaging one's medications. Others might useclothes with large buttons or hook-and-loop fas-teners when faced with dressing difficulties.Changes in the environment such as the addi-tion of handrails, raised toilet seats, and showerstools also can be implemented. Cognitive Changes There is a high variability in cognitive func-tioning both within individuals and across indi-viduals. Some cognitive functions decline withage, some remain stable, and others improve.Most studies suggest that people in their 30sand 40s show their best cognitive abilities,which decline thereafter. However, it is esti-mated that cognitive changes become noticeableonly when people are in their 70s. A distinction is often made between fluid intelligence versus crystallized intelligence . Fluid intelligence is believed to decline over time,whereas crystallized intelligence is believed toremain stable (Abeles et al., 1998). Some of theskills that decline with age include informationprocessing speed, divided attention, sustainedattention (the ability to focus cognitive activityon a stimulus), performance on visual-spatialtasks (e.g., drawing and block construction),word finding, rapid naming ability, abstraction,and mental flexibility. Short-term memory mayshow slight decline with age (such as forgetful-ness), while long-term memory (related toretrieval) is mildly affected by normal aging.Verbal comprehension and expression remain sta-ble. Vocabulary may improve with age. It also isbelieved that wisdom and the accumulation ofpractical expertise continue to improve through-out the lifespan (Abeles et al., 1998).Common Pathological Cognitive Changes Delirium. Delirium , an acute and usually reversible condition, is quite common in hospitalsettings, accounting for 10%-15% of admissionsin elders; another 10%-40% may be diagnosedduring their hospital stay (American PsychiatricAssociation, 1994). Delirium is very commonlyseen in the terminally ill, with up to 80% devel-oping it as they near death. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV , American Psychiatric Associa-tion, 1994) defines delirium as: 1. Disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shiftattention. 2. A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, or language dis-turbance) or the development of a per-ceptual disturbance that is not betteraccounted for by a preexisting, estab-lished, or evolving dementia. 3. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days)and tends to fluctuate over the course ofthe day.28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 104 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 105 4. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratoryfindings that the disturbance is causedby several different possible eventsincluding general medical conditions(cancer, AIDS), metabolic disturbances(including electrolyte disturbances asoccurs with dehydration), drug intoxica-tion, drug withdrawal, drug side effects,and multiple etiologies. A good history and intake is important because delirium could easily be misinterpretedas many other disorders including psychoticdisorders, dementia, and mood disorders withpsychotic features. The prognosis for an individual with delir- ium is good to excellent if correctly identifiedand treated. Particularly in the medically ill,delirium is associated with increased risk ofdeveloping medical complications and func-tional decline. If misdiagnosed, delirium can belife threatening, leading to coma, seizures, andeventual death. The impact of delirium on communica- tion. Given that a person with delirium com- monly experiences hallucinations and tends tobe disoriented and confused, communication isoften fraught with misinterpretation and theperson is likely to respond inappropriately(Springhouse, 2001). The following are guide-lines for communication with delirious elderly: Keep the discussion simple and ques- tions concise. Use large print calendars and clocks to assist with orientation to time. Pictures of family members and loved ones might assist in reorienting the elder. Some older adults may experience an increased state of delirium in the dark-ness, so a well-lit room might be helpful. Offer frequent reassurance, because the person is likely to be anxious and fear-ful. Physical restraints are notrecom- mended, because they may increasefear and agitation. Distraction andsoothing conversation should be triedinstead. Dementia. There are over 35 million elderly over the age of 65 in the United States (U.S.Bureau of the Census, 2000). This number isprojected to increase to 70 million in the year2030. This poses the potential for a dramaticincrease in those with the highest vulnerabilityfor dementia . Dementia is not a disease, but rather a grouping of symptoms known as a syn-drome, which may be caused by a number ofdifferent sources (Anthony & Aboraya, 1992).This is a progressive illness that impairs socialand occupational functioning (American Psy-chiatric Association, 1994). The DSM-IV(1994) defines the criteria for dementia as: 1. Development of cognitive deficits: The person cannot recall new or pre- viously learned information. Memory problems must be present. 2. One or more of the following: a.Apraxia: Impaired motor activities due to damage to motor cortex (e.g.,the person cannot use a key) b.Aphasia: Language disturbance (e.g., cannot find words or put sentencestogether) c.Agnosia: Failure to recognize or iden- tify objects (e.g., the person may seesomething but cannot label it or tellwhat it is used for) d.Disturbed executive problems due tofrontal lobe damage28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 105 106 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication 1.First Stage (duration 2-4 years, leading up to and including diagnosis) Progressive memory loss (e.g., forget- fulness, misplaced objects) and confu-sion (e.g., easily overwhelmed bytasks, disorientation) Mood and personality changes\u2014 may become more labile ordepressed Loss of spontaneity and initiative in verbal and nonverbal communicationand activity engagement Decreased concentration abilities Impaired judgment and thinking 2.Second stage (duration 2-8 years) Increasing memory loss and confusion Difficulty recognizing loved ones Poor impulse control with frequent outbursts, mood lability May show aggressive behavior Hallucinations or delusions Aphasia and confabulation (filling in words or memory gaps with infor-mation that is made up in order tocompensate for memory loss) Agraphia (inability to write) Sleep disorders Agnosia Repetitive behaviors common, wandering and restlessness Hyperorality (the need to taste and orally examine objects small enoughto be placed in the mouth) 3.Third stage (duration 1-3 years) Loss of weight or conversely binge eating and weight gain Loss of most self-care skills Incontinence of urine and bowels Minimal to no communication, may screamIn addition to general loss of cognitive func- tioning, it is typical to see changes in personal-ity, affect, and behavior over the course of thedisease as a result of pathophysiological changesin the brain (Kasl-Godley & Gatz, 2000). Dementia can have irreversible or reversible causes. The term irreversible refers to the inability to cure or reverse the symptoms with medical orpsychological treatment. Examples of irreversiblecauses include head trauma (repeated blows to thehead, as happens in professional boxing), infec-tions such as those related to HIV and AIDS,brain tumors, and genetic diseases (Holland,1999). Other irreversible causes include pro-gressive diseases such as Huntington's Pick's disease, Lewy bodydementia, and Parkinson's can also be caused by vascular diseaseincluding multi-infarct dementia, which is causedby a series of small strokes (Kasl-Godley & Gatz,2000). Approximately 10%-20% of dementias are reversible (Cooper, 1999). These are sometimesreferred to as pseudodementias. The potential forreversibility depends on the etiology and treat-ment availability (Kaplan & Sadock, 1998). Typ-ical causes include depression, hypothyroidism,drug toxicity, and hydrocephalus. Dementia sec-ondary to depression is reversible, although recentresearch has indicated that a large number of theseindividuals go on to develop irreversible demen-tia later & Peskind, 1992). Alzheimer's disease. As previously men- tioned, dementia can be caused by a number ofdifferent sources. Alzheimer's disease is respon-sible for 50%-60% of all dementias in adultsafter the age of 60. The progression of dementiaof the Alzheimer's type is commonly detailedinto three stages:28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 106 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 107 Multiple physical health problems and eventual death Progressive decrease in ability to respond to environmental stimuli Alzheimer's disease has often been deemed a disease of \"ruling out.\" Although neuropsycho-logical testing can be very useful in clinical diag-nosis, a definitive diagnosis may be made afterdeath when an autopsy is performed and the hall-mark pathophysiological features are identified. Delirium and dementia are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Delirium can occur in a per-son with dementia, making accurate diagnosis andtreatment difficult. It is important, therefore, todevelop an understanding of the similarities anddifferences between the two. A good history isimportant in helping with differentiation. How-ever, given the person's symptom presentation(e.g., confusion and disorientation), the person isunlikely to be a good historian. Collateral infor-mation is important to gather, if possible. Refer toTable 4-2 for a comparison of the two conditions. The impact of dementia on communica- tion. Communication with an individual with dementia is extremely important to successfulinteraction and completion of caregiving duties.In the early stages of dementia, individuals may have difficulty finding the words to express what theyare trying to say (aphasia) and they may substi-tute one word for another. They may not be ableto understand abstract concepts or more compli-cated language phrases. In either of these cases,elders and caregivers can become frustrated,embarrassed, and upset about their inability tocommunicate with each other effectively. Thiscan lead to a reduction in social contact andreduced feelings of self-worth for the patient. In individuals with more moderate to severe demen- tia,verbal abilities are likely to be severely lim-ited. Many times individuals with cognitiveimpairment can become agitated because theydo not understand what is expected of them. Inaddition, they can become easily frustrated iftheir attempts at communication are misunder-stood. It may be important to use other meansof communication to facilitate understanding. Box 4-1 Research Highlight Aim: The study evaluated the relationship between communication problems andcaregivers' burden. Methods: Eighty-nine dementia care- givers completed a measure on commu-nication problems, care-recipientcognitive and functional status, care-recipient problem behaviors, and care-giver burden. Findings: Communication problems mediated the relationship between care-recipient cognitive and functional sta-tus and problem behaviors. Impairedcognitive and functional status alsoaccounted for greater levels of burden. Conclusion: The study emphasizes the important role that communicationplays in determining the quality of theinteraction between caregivers and carerecipients. Source: Savundranayagam, M.

Rememberthat shouting does not help with understandingand is likely to startle/upset the person withdementia. When interacting with someone who has dementia, make sure that the person is attend-ing to you prior to beginning a conversation.Face the person and speak slowly and clearly. Ifyou do not have the person's attention, wait amoment and try again. A gentle touch can behelpful, but be careful not to startle the person.Try to be eye level with the person so as to notcreate feelings of defensiveness or vulnerability.Begin by orienting the person to yourself (i.e.,introduce yourself) and refer to the person byname (assists in preserving self-identity andrelaxing the person). It is often helpful to reduceor eliminate background noise to improve thechances of maintaining the person's attentionand enable him or her to hear you more clearly.Sometimes touch can assist in conveying a mes-sage and comfort. The caregiver should be atten-tive to the person's responses, as some peoplemay recoil from touch. In such cases, simplegestures or visual aids may be more effective.Other methods of communication can involveuse of familiar songs/music or doing activitiestogether (e.g., going for a walk) to convey careand concern. Robinson, Spenser, and White (1999) rec- ommend a nondemanding approach for com-munication. The caregiver's attitude or approachcan often set the tone for the interaction. If youare calm, reassuring, and confident, the personis likely to respond in a relaxed and trustingmanner. Elders with dementia generally are stillattuned to nonverbal cues. If you are angry andtense, you are likely to find the person respond-ing to you in a like fashion. Keep the pitch ofyour voice low, especially when interacting withTable 4-2 Diagnostic Comparison between Delirium and Dementia (CONTINUED ) Delirium Dementia Object NamingTreatmentLoss of self-care skills due toinability to sequence steps for correctperformanceIntact to mildMaintain proper nutritional intakeMaintain fluid intake and memoryprompts, reminiscence therapy28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 109 110 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication It might be helpful to break tasks into small manageable steps and provide very simple, cleardirections. Taking a bath can be overwhelming orconfusing to the individual when taken as a wholeevent and will need to be simplified. When help-ing someone to undress for bathing, the first stepmight be to begin with unbuttoning his or hershirt. The next step might be taking one arm outof the sleeve. Sometimes contextual cues may behelpful. Others may only require verbal cues.Throughout the process, remember to keeptelling the person what it is you are planning todo next and what it is you are currently doing.Leading a person slowly to the bathroom mayassist in understanding what task is about tooccur. Likewise, utilizing props may also assistwith task recognition (e.g., handing the person awashcloth). Encourage the person to do as muchas they can and praise efforts. If an instructionneeds to be repeated, repeat it in the same way.This will facilitate comprehension. Assist withsteps that may be more difficult for the person toaccomplish on their own. This may be a littlemore time consuming than other approaches, butit is likely to be met with much less confusion andmore pleasant interaction. Use concrete terms and familiar words. Saying phrases such as \"Here is your toast\" maybe more readily understood than \"It's breakfasttime\" (Robinson et al., 1999). Try to offerchoices whenever possible. When offeringchoices, simplicity is better. Use a paired choiceprocedure (\"Would you like orange juice orwater?\") rather than using open-ended ques-tions, which could generate confusion (\"Whatwould you like to drink this morning?\"). Use ofconcrete terms is helpful here, as well. Allow theperson adequate time to respond, as the pro-cessing of verbal material is slower in individu-als with cognitive impairment. Refrain fromarguing or attempting to reason with the personregarding delusions or hallucinations, becausethis can further agitate the patient (Robinson etal., 1999). Instead, speak in soothing tones andattempt to distract the person, if possible. Encourage discussion of significant life events, family traditions, remote memories, and otherpast events to encourage social contact and a senseof comfort and security. Utilize memory aids suchas large print calendars or organizers to enhancememory. In early dementia, labeling items withlarge print helps in identification and recognitionof objects. Encouraging individuals to refer tothese aids can reduce anxiety and paranoia asso-ciated with being in unfamiliar surroundings(e.g., hospital room) and enhance self-dignity. The physical environment can be important for stimulating cognitive functioning, managingbehaviors, reducing depression and anxiety, andpromoting and maintaining as much independ-ence as possible (National Institute on Aging,2004). It may be helpful to establish a familiarenvironment, changing it as little as possible.When the person's environment must change(e.g., moving from home to an assisted livingfacility) incorporate familiar items from the oldenvironment. Include items that are personallyfamiliar. Contact family members to have thembring cherished and familiar items from home tofacilitate this (Robinson et al., 1999). Psychological Changes The prevalence of mental illness (with theexception of cognitive impairment) in olderadults is lower than in the general population.However, some older adults may suffer frommental illness in late life. The reasons for devel-oping mental illness in late life vary widely.Some older adults may have suffered from men-tal illness throughout their lives, whereas oth-28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 110 Normal and Pathological Age-Related Changes That Affect Communication 111 ers may experience mental illness for the firsttime during old age due to changes in theirsocial, medical, or physical circumstances. How-ever, in general, older adults tend to report sat-isfaction with life at similar rates as the generalpopulation (Abeles et al., 1998). Pathological Psychological Changes Depression. Depression is a very serious con- dition that is characterized by at least five of thefollowing symptoms: sadness, anhedonia (lack ofinterest or pleasure in activities that one once usedto enjoy), significant weight loss or gain, a markeddecrease or increase in sleep, psychomotor agita-tion or retardation, fatigue or loss of interest, feel-ings of worthless or inappropriate guilt, impairedability to concentrate or think, and recurrentthoughts of death including suicide ideation orattempts (American Psychiatric Association,1994). Although we all feel \"depressed\" or \"blue\"sometimes, clinical depression is more intense,broader, and lasts for at least 2 weeks. Depression is associated with increased risk of death (either from medical conditions or fromsuicide), a greater number of medical conditions,higher health care costs, and longer hospital Hui, Nienaber, Musick, & Tierney,1994; Frasure-Smith, Lesperance, & Talajic,1993; Jiang et al., 2001). Furthermore, the sui-cide rate in older white men is higher than in anyother category (National Center for Injury Pre-vention and Control). In addition to the negativeconsequences associated with depression for theelderly sufferer, depression affects the entire fam-ily. Research has shown that caregivers ofdepressed elderly have poorer mental health andperceived quality of life (Sewitch, McCusker,Dendukuri, & Yaffe, 2004). Caregiving for de-pressed elderly is associated with many hours ofinformal care and, as a result, is very costly tosociety as well as to the caregivers themselves(Langa, Valenstein, Fendrick, Kabeto, & Vijan,2004). Unique characteristics of depression in the elderly. Depression in the elderly often is associated with multiple medical conditionsthat limit functioning and mobility. It also isassociated with life transitions and with achange in one's status and role as many olderadults transition out of the workforce and haveto find a new sense of purpose and meaning intheir life. Loss of family members and friendsalso is common in older adults who may experi-ence a reduced support system. Many times,depressed older adults do not report depressedmood, but instead present with lack of interestand enjoyment as well as sleep and appetiteproblems that are mistaken for other medicalconditions (Abeles et al., 1998). What causes depression? Depression is a common condition, with about 5% to 10% ofcommunity-dwelling elderly being diagnosedwith clinical depression (Lebowitz et al., 1997).However, in long-term care, these rates are sev-eral times higher. Although depression is com-mon in the elderly, it is not a normal part ofaging. It is not normal to be depressed, evenwhen you are old or disabled. Depression also isnot a sign of weakness or a punishment fromGod. There are many possible reasons for whyone becomes depressed. Depression has beenassociated with chemical changes in the brain orwith chemical imbalance (Leonard, 2000).Depression also has been associated with expe-riencing helplessness and with the sense of hav-ing no control over one's life (Seligman, Maier,& Geer, 1968). Others suggest that depressionis associated with negative views of one's self,the world, and others and that these views colorone's experiences in the world (Beck, 1964).28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 111 112 Chapter 4: Aging Changes That Affect Communication Research also has shown that exposure to severeand prolonged stress results in depression(Frank, Anderson, Reynolds, Ritenour, &Kupfer, 1994). Most likely, depression is somecombination of all of these explanations. Treatment for depression. Research has shown that both medications and talk therapyare effective in treating depression in olderadults (Lebowitz et al., 1997). Electroconvulsivetherapy (ECT; the delivery of an electrical shockthat causes electrical activity in the brain) alsois an effective alternative, especially when anti-depressant medications cannot be taken due totheir side effects or due to interaction with othermedications. Unfortunately, however, only asmall fraction of depressed older adults receivetreatment. This can be due to several reasons,including the stigma attached to mental illness,difficulties accessing care, or lack of awarenessof available services. Difficulties recognizingand distinguishing depression from other med-ical conditions that present with similar symp-toms are particularly common in the elderly(Charney et al., 2003). The impact of depression on communi- cation. Often, depressed older adults lose the inclination to interact with others and becomeincreasingly withdrawn. Furthermore, becauseof their depressed mood, multiple physicalcomplaints, and lack of interest in pleasurableactivities, others may prefer not to interact withdepressed elderly. This results in depressed el-derly being prone to isolation when they are ingreatest need for support. As a health profes-sional, you should become aware of your ownfeelings about working with depressed elderly.Realizing one's own biases is the first steptowards providing better care for the elderly.It also is important to remember that depres- sion is not a willful condition and, therefore,encouraging the elderly to \"just snap out of it\"is not likely to help. Instead, gently and per-sistently encouraging older adults to engage ineven minor activities is likely to eventuallyresult in an improvement in their mood. It alsois important to be aware of the potential stigmaassociated with mental illness. Many olderadults may not express their depressed feelingsopenly and may not wish to share their depres-sion with others. Being respectful and under-standing of their concerns is essential. However,at the same time, you should try to engage andto communicate your availability to the elderly. Lack of concentration and indecisiveness are potential symptoms of depression. This is likelyto make communication with the elderly slightlymore challenging and may require repetition ofinformation or the use of memory aides (e.g.,sticky notes or a notebook) to improve the abil-ity of the elderly to retain information. Concluding Comments In this chapter, we have discussed a variety ofchanges that can take place in older adults.These changes vary dramatically within andacross individuals and may or may not have animpact on communication. Many times, how-ever, these changes require patience, adaptation,and creativity on the part of the people whointeract with the elderly. The next chapter willdiscuss some of the psychosocial interventionsthat improve communication with older adultswho present with sensorimotor or cognitivedeficits. 28438_CH04_085_120.qxd 6/7/06 12:01 PM Page 112 Concluding Comments 113 Critical Thinking Exercises 1.

Alzheimer's disease: A progressive, neurodegenerative disease of the brain. Aphasia: An inability to express or understand the meaning of words due to damage in the languageareas of the brain. Cataracts : Clouding of the lens, which blocks light reflecting through the lens and can blur the imagethat is reflected onto the retina, resulting in hazyvision. Conductive problems: Sound waves are blocked as they travel from the outer ear canal to the inner ear,thus there is a decrease in hearing sensitivity. Confabulation: Filling in words or memory gaps with information that is made up in order to compen-sate for memory loss. Crystallized intelligence: The accumulation of knowl- edge over the lifespan. Delirium: An acute, reversible state of agitation and confusion. Dementia: A progressive and chronic deterioration of cognitive function. Depression: A serious disorder that involves sadness, lack of interest, and other symptoms, such ashopelessness and decreased energy for at least 2 weeks. Diabetic retinopathy: As a long-term effect of diabetes, the blood vessels to eyes grow weak and rupture,causing vision loss that may lead to blindness. Dysarthria: Disturbed articulation. Fine motor movement: Movement produced by the small muscle groups.Fluid intelligence: The acquisition of new information. Glaucoma: A collection of eye disorders characterized by a buildup of viscous fluid (aqueous humor) in theintraoccular cavity. Gross motor movement: Movement produced by the large muscle groups. Gustation: The chemical sense of taste. IADLs: More complex tasks that include handling finances, preparing meals, or managing one'smedications. Macular degeneration: Neurons in the center part of the retina no longer function. Olfaction: The chemical senses of smell. Presbycusis: Latin for \"old eyes\"\u2014the person cannot focus as clearly when objects are up close. Sensorineural problems: Sound wave transmission is interrupted from the inner ear to the brain, mostlikely due to damage to the cochlea and/or audi-tory nerve. Somatosensory system: Provides information about a variety of skin sensations including temperature,touch, or pain. Tinnitis : A condition in which the person experiences a persistent ringing, buzzing, humming, roaring, orother noise in the ears that only the person canhear. Verbal apraxia: Difficulty executing mouth and speech movements. Visual acuity: The ability to identify objects. References Abeles, N., Cooley, S., Deitch, I. M., Harper, M.

We rely on our ability to com-municate effectively to gather and share infor-mation as well as to build relationships withpatients and their families. Learning and prac-ticing the art of communication is key to oursuccess as clinicians. For many clinicians, communicating with older adults can be anxiety producing andfraught with challenges. These challenges maybe associated with our memories of past diffi-culties communicating with older adults, bethey family members, clergy, teachers, or neigh-bors, or they may be related to the physiologi-cal or psychosocial characteristics associatedwith aging. The purpose of this chapter is toreview basic principles of communication andpresent strategies for communicating with olderadults. This information should promote devel-opment of the skills needed to communicateeffectively and promote optimal health for olderadults. Communication The term communication is used frequently in our language and in our work. The term originates from the Latin word \"commune,\" which means\"to hold in common.\" By virtue of its origins,the word implies that communication is aprocess that involves more than one person.Communication is the process or means bywhich an individual relates experiences, ideas,knowledge, and feelings to another. Commun-ication is a reciprocal process involving mini-mally two people, a sender and a receiver.Effective communication depends on the abilityof both to engage in the process of sharing notmerely words, but also concepts, emotions, andthoughts. Physiologically, communication occurs as a result of a complex interaction of cognition,hearing, speech, and language centers. Cogni-tion is essential to sending, receiving, and inter-preting information in our communications.Cognitive centers in the brain are the basis forstoring memory, developing emotion, formingjudgments, and creating knowledge. From thetime of birth, as we process new sensory infor-mation, cognitive centers in the brain are storingmemories that will over time allow us to recog-nize patterns, forming complex thoughts andjudgments. The cortex of the brain is the pri-mary repository for cognition. Within the cor-tex are a multitude of interlinked storage areasthat help store, retrieve, and make sense of mes-sages coming from the world. The ability tostore and use this knowledge is dependent uponmany factors, including age, nutrition, activity,chemical balance, and the presence of any cere-brovascular disorders that could interfere withfunction. The second cortical function that is impor- tant for communication is language productionand the ability to speak. Language is the use ofsymbols or gestures that are common to groupsand serve as a means of sharing thoughts, ideas,and emotions. Infants learn to assign specificsounds, known as words, to objects, activities,and ultimately emotions. This is often referredto as our primary language. As we age we learnnot only to speak, but also to read and write thesymbols associated with our primary language.28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 122 Hearing-Assistive Devices 123 Throughout our lifetime we may learn a num-ber of different languages. The ability to speakand understand multiple languages depends onfrequency of use and environment. No matterhow many languages we learn over the course ofa lifetime, initial memories of our primary lan-guage serve as the foundation for all futurelearning. There may be many different dialectsor meanings assigned to words within a lan-guage based on geography or age. Cortical centers located in the parietal lobe of the dominant hemisphere, often referred to asthe speech center, are the primary area of lan-guage development and speech production.Broca's area at the junction of the parietal andfrontal lobes in the dominant hemisphere isresponsible for speech production, whereasWernicke's center at the intersection of the pari-etal and temporal lobes is the area of speechrecognition. Damage to these areas will result inaphasia, an acquired loss or impairment of lan- guage. The most common cause of aphasia is thebrain damage that occurs with a stroke. Speech refers to oral communication of the sounds or words associated with language. Inaddition to the speech centers in the brain,speech production is dependent upon musclesand structures responsible for ventilation,phonation, and articulation. Important struc-tures of speech are the diaphragm, intercostalmuscles, larynx, vocal cords, tongue, and mus-cles of the mouth and face. When someone sus-tains damage to these structures, we say theindividual has dysarthria . Dysarthria refers to a group of neuromuscular disorders that affectthe speed, strength, range, timing, or accuracyof speech movements, which often result inreduced intelligibility of speech. The individualknows what he or she wants to say, but may havedifficulty producing sounds or words that can beunderstood by others. Dysarthria can be presentfrom birth as a result of cerebral palsy or otherbirth injuries, or may develop later in life as aresult of facial injury, tumors, or paralysis asso-ciated with a stroke. Individuals with dysarthriamay use assistive technology to augment or replace vocal communication. Hearing-Assistive Devices There are a variety of forms of assistive technologythat help individuals with impaired speech com-municate with the world around them. Assistivetechnology is \"any item, piece of equipment, orproduct system, whether acquired commerciallyoff the shelf, modified or customized, that is usedto increase, maintain, or improve functional capa-bilities of individuals with disabilities\" (Olson &DeRuyter, 2002, p. 4). Assistive technology canhelp individuals improve their mobility, commu-nication, self-care, or vocational skills. An aug- mentative and alternative communication(AAC) system is \"an integrated group of compo- nents, including symbols, aids, strategies andtechniques used by individuals to enhance com-munication\" (Henderson & Doyle, 2002, p. 127). A speech language pathologist and an occu- pational therapist must conduct a thoroughevaluation to assess the individual's abilities,limitations, and ability to effectively use a pre-scribed communication system. If a patient whouses an AAC system to communicate is admit-ted to your unit, it is important to learn from thepatient or his or her caregiver how to use the de-vice. Out of courtesy, ask permission from theindividual with a disability prior to using orhandling any assistive technology, and always berespectful by storing it in a place that is acces-28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 123 124 Chapter 5: Therapeutic Communication with Older Adults sible to the patient and that provides the great-est degree of safety for the device. All nursingstaff and health care professionals who work withthe patient should learn to use the device andallow time for the patient to use the device tocommunicate. Staff should be aware of basicoperations (e.g., battery charging) necessary tokeep the unit in functional order and providethe patient with the opportunity to safely storeand charge the device as needed. Nonverbal Communication Communication can be verbal or nonverbal.Nonverbal communication refers to behaviors orBox 5-1 Research Highlight Aim: The purpose of this secondary analysis was to interpret narratives from a previous study to gain a better understanding of the common meanings and experiences of personsusing AAC devices. Methods: The researchers analyzed original data obtained from a Web-based focus group. Data came from online responses to questions at a conference Web site with free expres-sion of dialogue by 16 participants, though responses were monitored. A research teamused Heideggerian hermeneutics for the secondary analysis. Findings: Six themes and one pattern emerged: \"1) maintaining effective communication, 2) interacting in various situations, 3) AAC device-imposing limitations, 4) wadingthrough prepackaged technology, 5) AAC device giving more than a voice, and 6) accept-ing the AAC device\" (p. 215). Researchers summarized that \"communication technologyenables humanness\" (p. 215). Conclusions: AAC devices were more than technology to the users. They provided a means of remaining human and connected with the world through communicating with others. Inaddition, nurses should realize that users of such devices may require more time in use, butthat these devices have personal meaning to users and allowed them to participate in society,certainly a goal of rehabilitation for those of any age.

Nonverbal communicationcan either enhance the delivery of a message orcreate a barrier to understanding. When a schoolcrossing guard says \"STOP\" loudly and raisesher hand with all five fingers extended, the indi-vidual is using a common nonverbal gesture toenhance the message delivered verbally. Whenwe use eye contact in addition to a verbal greet-ing, we are using a nonverbal gesture along withwords to welcome the individual. When similarverbal communication and nonverbal gesturesare together, they can help us to deliver our mes-sage and improve communications. Vocal nonverbal communication refers to the tone, pitch, speech rate, or fluency of verbal com-munication. In the example above, the school28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 124 crossing guard used pitch and tone to say\"STOP\" loudly, thereby catching our attention.What if the guard said the same word but in anormal voice\u2014would it convey the same mean-ing? A nurse, directing a patient to a clinic examroom, who says in a loud, harsh tone, \"Come hereto this room,\" may be perceived by the patientto be stern and uninterested in him or her as aperson. To communicate effectively we should beaware of our verbal and nonverbal vocal com-munications. What we say and how we say it areessential to therapeutic communication. Nonvocal nonverbal communication refers to the use of facial gestures, body posture, eye con-tact, and touch as a means of communication.This chapter already mentioned how the use ofeye contact along with a verbal word of welcomecan enhance communication. Let's now picturethe staff member looking intently at a chart,avoiding any eye contact or facial expressionwhile greeting a new patient. In this example,the staff member's nonverbal communicationsspeaks louder than his words. In this case, thepatient may report the service was poor and staffwas uninterested. Nonverbal communication on the part of the patient is also an important factor in therapeuticcommunication in a health care setting. Look atCase Study 5-1 . The staff nurse used a simple ver- bal comment to clarify the meaning of the pa-tient's nonverbal behavior and determine her nextaction. A patient's nonverbal communication canprovide nurses insight into the person's feelingsand emotions. Learning to read the patient's non-verbal gestures is important for nurses. Communication involves more than one per- son, so both the sender and the receiver must beattentive and demonstrate good communica-tion skills. The goal of effective communication\"is interpreting the messages and responding Nonverbal Communication 125 sponds \"I am waiting for my son. He isgenerally on time. I hope nothing bad hashappened. I would like to go the bath-room before he arrives so I don't have toworry about that during his visit.\" What is the nurse's most appropriate response in this situation? Should thenurse have done anything differentlyduring the first visit to the room onrounds? If so, what? What nonverbalcommunication would the nurse expectto see from Mrs. Hale? What nonver-bals should the nurse include in her careof this woman?A student nurse on rounds enters a patient's room and finds an olderwoman sitting comfortably in a wheel-chair in no apparent distress staring outthe window with her back to the nurse.Is this patient inviting communicationfrom the nurse? Based on the patient'sposition and posture, the nurse may electto not speak or say anything fearing shemight disturb the patient. Shortly thestaff nurse enters the room and com-ments, \"Mrs. Hale, are you waiting forsomeone? Can I do anything to help youget ready for a visit?\" Mrs. Hale re- Case Study 5-128438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 125 126 Chapter 5: Therapeutic Communication with Older Adults in an appropriate manner\" (Caris-Verhallen,Kerkstra, and Bensing, 1997, p. 916). Throughour communications we are not merely sendinga message, but creating a shared meaning andunderstanding of an event, experience, or mem-ory. Understanding and respecting the messageof the sender is essential to effective communi-cations. The receiver must be open to the ideas ofthe sender and provide respect during the con-versation. Being silent, showing attentiveness,and listening to the sender are critical. Good lis-tening starts with allowing time for conversationto occur; when we are rushed it is difficult to givethe time and attention needed to truly under-stand the meaning associated with the words spo-ken. Understanding is enhanced when we shareour interpretation with the sender, asking him orher to validate our interpretation or clarify mis-interpretations. Try to approach each conversa-tion with an open mind and a willingness tolisten. Effective communication does not requireagreement, but it does necessitate listening andtaking into account the meaning of an idea, event, or experience described by the other person. Using communication and conversation we learn to-gether and build a common bond through ourunderstanding and respect for others. Communication in Health Care Communication is the essence of nursing. Goodcommunication in health care is the foundationfor optimal outcomes. Nurses use therapeuticcommunication skills to gather assessment datafrom patients and their families that is essentialto diagnosis and care planning. We rely on ourcommunication skills to provide informationand education, and to encourage patients tochange behavior and promote health. Nursesprovide the caring word or touch that helps torelieve pain or distress. Communication is a two-way process, so it is important to look at communication in healthcare from the consumer or patient perspective.Caris-Verhallen, Kerkstra, and colleagues (1997),in a review of the literature on the role of com-munication in nursing care of the older adult, dis-cuss the distinction between instrumental ortask-focused communications and affective communication from the perspective of the con- sumer. Instrumental or task-focused communi-cations refers to behavior necessary for assessingand solving problems. Think about the conver-sations you have with patients that are focused on\"caring for\" the person. In these conversations,the primary interest of the health care provider isto gather information that will help them providecare for the person. These conversations may beformal and structured, such as the admissioninterview, a health assessment, discussion of ad-vance directives, or patient-family education. Inthese conversations, the health care provider isinitiating the conversation with a specific intentof gathering information from the patient thatwill be of assistance in diagnosing or treatingpatient problems. Instrumental communica- tions may be informal conversations as well. Informal conversations include when the nurseasks the patient \"What time do you want to eat?\"or \"What would you like me to order for yourmeal today?\" Once again, the conversation isfocused on the health care provider requestinginformation necessary for caring for the patient.In all these cases the conversation is generally ini-tiated by the health care provider and the focus isa question about how best to care for the patient.Patients want to be cared for, but they often alsowant more\u2014to be \"cared about\" as a person.28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 126 Communicating with the Older Adult 127 The second type of communication from the patient perspective is affective communication,which focuses on how the health care provider iscaring about the patient and his or her feelingsand emotions. Affective communications tendto be more informal and more difficult forhealth care providers. There is a greater degreeof vulnerability for the health care provider inaffective or psychosocial communications todevelop an emotional or personal relationshipwith the patient. Look at the example in Case Study 5-2 . By electing to spend time with the patient and allowing him time to talk about hislife and emotions, the nurse conveyed her inter-est in knowing him as a person. During the con-versation the nurse gained information thatwould be of assistance in care planning for thepatient; however, this was not the primaryintent of the conversation. From the patient'sperspective the nurse showed interest in caringabout him rather than caring for him.Affective communication is important in long-term health care relationships, be it a nursepractitioner treating a patient with chronic ill-ness in the clinic or a nurse working with apatient in long-term care or in the home. Thinkabout ways a nurse can demonstrate caringabout the person rather than merely caring forthe person. Communicating with the Older Adult Communication with older adults can be quiterewarding, though at times it is fraught withchallenges for both the sender and the receiver.Physiological changes associated with aging orsecondary to chronic illness and disease can posea barrier to communication. Common physio-logical changes associated with aging that inter-fere with communication include high-frequency How did the nurse facilitate thera- peutic communication in this case?What types of nonverbals would youexpect to see on the part of the nurse?On the part of the older man? Whatdoes this situation remind us about withregards to communication? How mightthe nurse have handled this situationdifferently? What might have happenedif the nurse had taken a differentapproach to conversation?A nurse walks into the day room of an assisted living unit and sees an oldermale resident playing cards alone. Thenurse approaches the man and asks ifhe would like to play with a partner.The nurse proceeds to play a hand ofcards with him. During the card game,the two converse about how the resi-dent enjoyed playing cards with his wifewhile she was alive. The resident talksabout how he misses his wife and theimpact her death has had on him.

Communicating with others can be facili- tated by paying attention to the basic principlesof conversation. In her book, Making Contact , renowned family therapist and author VirginiaSatir describes the basic principles for makingcontact and communicating with others. Thebasic principles are invite, arrange environment,maximize communication, maximize under-standing, and follow through. An invitation says to the other person that you are interested in them and sharing timewith them. Health care providers can make anumber of gestures that show respect and inter-est in the patient as a person. It can be as sim-ple as arranging time for a conversation ratherthan doing an assessment on the run. As thenew patient arrives on the unit, the nurseextends a greeting and conducts a triage assess-ment of the individual's health status while say-ing to the patient, \"I will be coming to yourroom in about 15 minutes to meet with you andget some information to help us care for youhere.\" Meanwhile, the nurse makes arrange-ments to minimize distractions during the ad-mission interview. Another inviting strategy is to greet the per- son by name and ask a nonthreatening open-ended question, thereby engaging the person inconversation. Think about the difference betweenan interrogation and a conversation\u2014which ismore pleasant? \"Tell me about yourself and whatbrought you here today\" invites the person toshare information about themselves in a non-threatening manner. See Table 5-1 for other types of open-ended questions. The second basic principle is to arrange an environment conducive to communication. Theenvironment should be comfortable, provideprivacy, and minimize distractions that could bebarriers to communication, such as noise or poorlighting. At times, nurses invite patients tocome into our space; for example, when webring the patient to a treatment room in theclinic, the exam room often includes two chairs,which the health care provider can use to posi-tion themselves face to face with the intervieweein order to facilitate communication. Othertimes health care providers enter a patient'shome or room in a long-term care setting, inwhich case we are entering the patient's territoryand space. It is important to respect personalspace and territory when arranging an environ-ment conducive to conversation. When enteringan older patient's space, simple gestures such asasking permission to sit or move the furnitureconveys a sense of respect for the person. If theindividual uses assistive equipment such as awheelchair, cane, or communication device, askpermission before touching the equipment. It isequally important to ask where items should beplaced prior to leaving the room to facilitateindependence and provide safety. The ideal position when communicating with a patient is one whereby the sender and receiverare seated 3-6 feet apart with chairs positionedto allow for eye-to-eye contact. When having aconversation with a person in a wheelchair, re-member to pull up a chair and position yourselfat equal height to the person. For patients withimpaired vision, reposition the chair so you canbe seen within their field of vision. The third principle is to use communication strategies that maximize the individual's abilityto understand the message. This includes usinglanguage and terminology that are familiar tothe patient. It is our responsibility as the senderto use language appropriate for the receiver. Inhealth care this is especially important when the28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 128 Communicating with the Older Adult 129 Table 5-1 Open-Ended Questions for Starting a Conversation Ask questions about the past. \"Out of all the places you have lived, what made some better thanothers?\" \"Tell me about the places you have visited in your lifetime.\" \"Tell me what kind of work you did and how you got into thatfield of employment.\" \"I see you have been coming to this hospi-tal for a number of years; can you tell me about these visits andhow I can make your stay more comfortable?\" \"According to your records you have seen a number of our homehealth staff; can you tell me about services you have received?\" Ask personal questions. \"Tell me about your family.\" \"I see you have grandchildren. Can you tell me about them andwhere they are located?\"\"How did you meet your husband? Tell me about your courtshipand wedding.\" Inquire about what is new \"You have been coming to the clinic more often this year; can you and different. tell me why and what changes have occurred?\" \"Tell me about your session with the physical therapist yesterday.\"\"I see you have a new roommate; can you tell me how things areworking out between the two of you?\"\"Tell me about the meals you are receiving.\" Ask about their hopes \"When you were younger what did you wish for?\" and dreams. \"What do you wish for your family?\" Talk about facts or mutually \"Your physician just left; tell me about your conversation.\" shared events. \"I saw you were watching the news at breakfast; tell me what'sgoing on in the world today.\" Ask how and why questions. \"I see you had quite a few children; how did you manage raising them?\" \"You are on a number of medications; tell me how you keep trackof what to take and when.\"\"What do you do to stay so active?\" Reference current events that \"This summer is so hot. What's your favorite summer experience?\" are meaningful to most people. \"Today is Valentine's Day. Tell me about a special valentine in your life.\" Source: Adapted from Cox & Waller, 1991. conversation involves health decision making orpatient education. When an individual has diffi-culty understanding English it may be necessaryto use an interpreter to present the informationto the individual in his or her primary language.Many hospitals provide phone access to inter-preters to improve communication betweenhealth care providers and consumers.28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 129 130 Chapter 5: Therapeutic Communication with Older Adults It is equally important to use age-appropriate language in communication. This is particularlyimportant when communicating with olderadults. Show respect by addressing the patient byhis or her surname. Avoid familiar terms such as \"honey,\" \"bud,\" or \"sweetie,\" which can be de- meaning to the individual. During the initialinterview, ask the patient how he or she prefers tobe addressed and make note of this in the care planor medical record. Our language should demon-strate respect for the individual as an adult. Periodically ask the receiver to clarify what he or she is hearing as a means of ensuring accu-rate interpretation of your message. Mistakesoccur when we make assumptions and fail tovalidate understanding. Take the case of thenurse who told her patient to take a medicationprescribed TID \"after each meal.\" Based on herphysician's recommendation, the patient eats5-6 small meals per day. Several days postdis-charge the patient called for a prescription refill,and the nurse learned the patient was taking themedication after each meal, thus taking a min-imum of five pills per day. To maximize under-standing, ask the individual to repeat what yousaid or tell you what this means for them intheir life. This simple step can be a life saver andhelps you avoid communication errors. The next principle is to maximize under- standing. The most important skill to maximizeunderstanding is to learn to listen. Learning tolisten is essential to good communications. It ismuch easier to hear than it is to listen. Listeningrequires not only hearing the words spoken, butalso understanding the meaning and context inwhich they are spoken. We must be open mindedand provide opportunities for the individual toshare their thoughts with us. It means allowingtime to communicate and focusing attention onthe person at the time of the conversation. Min-imizing environmental distractions not onlyhelps the individual with whom we are commu-nicating, but also helps us maintain our focus. The final principle is to follow up and follow through. Words backed by actions help developtrust. A relationship built on trust and concernfor the welfare of others is critical to optimalhealth outcomes. These simple techniques canbe applied to all of our communications. Challenges inCommunicating with Older Adults Memory or Cognitive Deficits Physiological changes associated with chronicillness have various presentations. Although thebasic principles of communication still apply,they need to be modified to overcome barriersassociated with the individual's disability. Cog-nitive damage may occur secondary to metabolicdamage, stroke, or hormonal or degenerativedisease. Chapters 7 and 11 provide informationabout screening and treatment for those withmemory or cognitive problems. The mini-mentalstate exam (MMSE) is a reliable screening toolto assess cognitive function. Individuals withcognitive deficits secondary to diffuse corticaldamage present with signs of dementia, includ-ing decreased attention span, memory loss, wordfinding problems, and perseveration. Theseindividuals often have difficulty with conversa-tion and are dependent upon others to initiateconversation. All too often the individual's pos-ture and nonverbal communication conveys asense of disinterest; thus, staff members arereluctant to initiate conversations. Early on inthe disease process, conversation and the oppor-28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 130 Challenges in Communicating with Older Adults 131 tunity to share memories with others can berewarding and energizing for the person. Reg-ular conversation helps orient the individual todaily activities and creates a structure that pro-motes independence. Conversation that encour-ages thought and reflection can help keep themind active. Just as exercise is important to themaintenance of physical function and mobility,mental exercise is equally important. Table 5-2 outlines the basic principles of communicationand strategies that benefit individuals withmemory or cognitive deficits. One of the most common problems affecting cognition and memory among the elderly isAlzheimer's disease. The Rush Manual for Care- givers (2002) offers several suggestions for mak- ing communication easier with those who havedementia. Dialogue should be encouraged for aslong as possible. Use simple instructions and askyes or no questions. Use cues from the person'sbehavior and reactions to decide whether tomodify your approach. Be aware of one's ownbody language and tone of voice as well. Nursesmay need to experiment with various types ofcommunication, and approaches may need to bemodified as the person's dementia progresses. Speech Deficits or Impairments (Aphasia) Aphasia is an acquired loss or impairment of lan-guage that occurs as a result of damage to thespeech centers in the dominant hemisphere of thebrain. There are many types of aphasia.Individuals with aphasia should be evaluated by aspeech language pathologist who can provideinstruction on the best strategies to use with eachperson. The most common types of aphasia areglobal aphasia, and Wernicke'saphasia. Patients with aphasia typicallyhave problems understanding language as well asproducing speech. Language is typically nonfunc-tional in all modalities, speaking, reading, andwriting. At times the individual may repeat asound or word over and over. Although the indi-vidual may have difficulty speaking he or she mayunderstand nonverbal gestures. It is important to include all patients with aphasia into socialgroups. Nonverbal gestures such as noddingtoward the individual as you address them makethe individual feel included. Broca's aphasia is a nonfluent, agrammatic aphasia. Individuals with Broca'saphasia typically have good auditory compre-hension. They are able to understand what issaid to them; however, they have difficulty pro-ducing intelligible speech. This is often quitefrustrating for these individuals, because theyknow what they want to say but just can't get itout in words that have meaning to the receiver.Communication requires great patience. It isimportant to give the patient an opportunity tospeak, because with time and therapy these indi-viduals may make important gains in learningto communicate with others. Wernicke's aphasia is a fluent aphasia. The individual is able to speak and produce lan-guage, although the speech may contain manyodd words and sounds. Wernicke's aphasia ischaracterized by impaired auditory comprehen-sion, so in this case the individual has great dif-ficulty understanding what is said. Often he orshe must rely on our nonverbal gestures tounderstand directions or questions. It takes time and patience to communicate with individuals with aphasia. Nurses shouldstructure activities and provide opportunities forthese individuals to be engaged in some form ofcommunication. Without opportunities to com-municate with others individuals may withdraw28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 131 132 Chapter 5: Therapeutic Communication with Older Adults Table 5-2 Communicating with Individuals with Memory or Cognitive Deficits Invite, Respect Approach persons in a nonthreatening manner within their visual field.Sit quietly with the person and gently touch her hand. Be respectful of the patient's belongings. At times patients can get overly upsetwhen an outsider touches their belongings, even basic items such as the tissue boxor washcloth. Ask permission before moving objects.Show concern; stop and have a conversation\u2014don't limit communication to timeswhen you need information. Environment Post a few pictures, a calendar, or a daily schedule in the patient's room and use itto enhance conversation or promote recall.Sit so you are facing the person when speaking.Avoid a setting with a lot of sensory stimulation\u2014it can be distracting to theperson.Maintain eye contact; it will help keep the patient focused on you and the topic.Be respectful of space. If the individual chooses to get up and start walking mid-conversation, ask if you may follow. Understanding Speak in normal tones. Use age-appropriate language.Start with a familiar topic. Sometimes this means talking about the past, thenthrough conversation bringing the person back to currect circumstances.Talk about people or events known to the person. This may mean referring to adeceased family member\u2014the individual will let you know if this reference iscomforting or distressing.For many individuals, pleasant memories from the past are a source of comfort.Orientation questions can be confusing and frustrating for the person, so ratherthan asking, \"What's today's date?\" today's and mark it so we can find it later.\"Ask one question at a time.If the individual becomes upset or agitated, ease up and use distraction to changethe topic or provide a period of quiet to allow a cool-down period. Communication Show interest in the person.If it is difficult to hear the person, gently ask his or her to speak louder.Provide time for conversation. Sometimes it will take awhile to get the messageout. Sometimes it is easier for the person to tell a story than respond to a directquestion. Don't laugh at responses, no matter how bizarre. Acknowledge your inability tounderstand and your frustration. It's probably a mutual feeling that both parties share.28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 132 Challenges in Communicating with Older Adults 133 and become socially isolated. The expertise ofthe speech therapist can be invaluable in help-ing patients to regain maximal communicationpatterns. See Table 5-3 for tips regarding com- municating with individuals with aphasia. Speech Impairments(Dysarthria) Dysarthria can occur secondary to a number ofdiseases. Even the loss of dentition that occurswith aging may predispose the individual todysarthria. Individuals with dysarthria may bedifficult to understand when they are speaking.Patience and practice are key to understandingindividuals with dysarthria. As one gets accus-tomed to the language sounds it becomes easierto understand what the individual is trying to say.As the receiver it is important not to fake or pre-tend you understand. If the message is not clear,ask the individual to repeat, write, or communi-cate key words by using gestures. Table 5-4 out- lines the basic principles of communication andspecific strategies that can be used to enhancecommunication with individuals with dysarthria. Table 5-3 Communicating with Individuals with Aphasia Invite, Respect Include the individual in conversations. Look at the person as well as othersduring conversation.Treat the person as an adult.Provide time for the individual to speak. Getting the message across is moreimportant than perfection.If you don't understand the person, politely say so: \"I'm sorry, I can't understandwhat you are saying to me.\"Remember, frustration works both ways\u2014it's always better to end the conver-sation with a smile rather than a frown. Environment Position yourself across from the person so they can see your face and you cansee theirs. Understanding Speak naturally. Don't raise your voice\u2014it won't help.Speak slowly using simple words and sentences. Use simple gestures to supplement your message. (This isn't a game of Charadesor Pictionary\u2014don't get carried away with your gestures.)Tell the patient one thing at a time. Announce topic changes and allow a fewminutes before proceeding. Communication Provide time for the individual to speak.Look at the person and listen as they speak.If you don't understand, ask them to describe the word, use another word, say orwrite the first letter, point to the item, or describe the context for use.If the individual is able to write, ask them to write the word or use a word boardto spell the word.Follow instructions from the speech language pathologist to improve the con- sistency of communication.28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 133 134 Chapter 5: Therapeutic Communication with Older Adults Visual Impairments Individuals with visual impairments have nodifficulty hearing or speaking; however, theywill miss nonverbal communications. Theseindividuals will have difficulty reading signs orrelying on visual cues for orientation or educa-tion purposes. Printed materials may need to belarge or translated into Braille to maximizeunderstanding. Table 5-5 outlines the basic principles of communication and techniquesthat can enhance communications with indi-viduals with visual impairments. Hearing Impairments Individuals with hearing loss fall into one of twogroups, the hearing impaired and those who aredeaf. Individuals with a hearing impairmenthave a reduced ability to hear across the spec-trum of sound. Typically, with age it becomesmore difficult to hear soft, high-pitched sounds.Based on the severity of the damage, the indi-vidual may or may not elect to use a hearing aid.Unless the hearing loss poses a significant dis-ability, the individual may elect to just get bywithout the hearing aid, at times much to thedismay of other family members. Many hearing-impaired elders have learned language and livedin an aural world so they tend to rely on lipreading, which matches oral gestures withsounds that are familiar to them. Table 5-6 outlines the basic principles to use when com-municating with individuals with hearing im-pairments. Figure 5-1 displays different typesTable 5-4 Communicating with Individuals with Dysarthria Invite, Respect Remember, speech impairment is not related to intelligence. Use age-appropriatelanguage.Make a note in the medical record if the individual uses an AAC device.If you know the individual uses an AAC device, store it in an accessible locationso it is readily available for use. Environment A quiet environment with minimal distractions can help facilitate understanding.Face the person as they are speaking for facial cues and gestures that can enhanceunderstanding. Understanding Remember, the individual has no problem hearing you. Speak in a normal tone. Communication Encourage the person to speak slowly and use simple sentences or single words.Allow time for the patient to respond. Don't try to complete their words orsentences.If there is no speech (aphasia, presence of an artificial airway, post-operatively afteroral surgery):Assess the individual's yes/no reliability.Establish a (picture board or eye blink\u20141 /H11005 yes, 2 /H11005 no). Post rules for use at the bedside and in the medical record. Ask yes/no questions and allow the person time to respond. Confirm response before acting. 28438_CH05_121_140.qxd 6/6/06 5:09 PM Page 134 Challenges in Commnicating with Older Adults 135 of hearing aids that may be used. Older adultswho participate in an audiologic rehabilitationprogram and have positive social support havebeen shown to perceive less of a self-handicapthan other hearing-impaired elderly (Taylor,2003). This study by Taylor suggests that adultswith hearing impairments would benefit frommore formal training of them and their spouseor supportive family member related to facili-tating long-term communication at home.Table 5-5 Communicating with Individuals with Visual Impairments Invite, Respect Gently call out to the individual when entering the room and identify yourselfand anyone with you in the room.If the individual can see shapes or outlines, stand where he or she can see you.The best location will vary\u2014make a note on the medical record alerting otherstaff to the patient's needs.

Describe the environment and where you are located inrelation to the person.Explain what you are doing, especially when you are moving and creating soundsin the room (e.g., storing dressing supplies in the closet, preparing equipment todraw blood, etc.).Make certain not to move frequently used objects. Understanding Alert the person when you will be touching them. Communication Oral communication with touch is more important than nonverbal gestures that they cannot see; use an appropriate tone of voice. In contrast, individuals who are deaf cannot hear. They rely on one of several forms of signlanguage as their primary language. Sign lan-guage is a different language, much likeGerman is different than the English language.Therefore, with few exceptions, qualified signlanguage interpreters should be used to ensureeffective communication with hearing-impairedpersons in emergency and other health care sit-uations where the rapid exchange of accurate Figure 5-1 Types of hearing aids.

Language and the meaning of words may change over time, so that as we age terms that were meaningful and relevant to our life at an early age are either no longer in use or havea different meaning to others not of our generation. (Example: \"to mimeograph\": Amethod of printing multiple documents that has since been replaced by Xerox or digi-tal printing methods.) a. List terms used by older adults that are no longer used in daily language (e.g., phonograph).b. List terms that are part of your world but are unfamiliar to older adults (e.g., MP3, CD).c. Discuss how age differences between sender and receiver can have an impact on com- munications. 2. Think about a time you visited the dentist and your mouth was anesthetized for a den- tal procedure. Describe how you felt communicating with others. To what degree werethey able to understand what you were trying to say? If you needed emergency care, couldyou communicate this need to others? In this example you experienced a temporary or transient episode of dysarthria. You mayhave been frustrated communicating with others or relied on alternative means, such as writ-ing, to communicate with others. Imagine if the anesthesia never wore off and your speechnever improved. Describe how you would feel in this circumstance.3.

The generalpopulation's concept of aging is generally, andalmost instinctively, characterized by changes inphysical appearance, functional decline, andchronic disease. All of these characteristics arethe result of physiological change. Even the psy-chological and social changes associated withaging, such as depression and social withdrawal,are often rooted in changes in the structure andfunction of the body's physiological systems.Thus, it could be argued that the physiology ofaging is true aging. Aging processes that occur in one physiologi- cal system can directly or indirectly influenceother physiological systems. Thus, although it isrelatively easy to focus on changes in only onephysiological system, a broader scope is necessaryto truly understand the influences and conse-quences of aging on physiological structure andfunction. This is especially true given that peopleare now living longer and for longer periods oftime in that stage of life that is currently consid-ered to be old age. Although each cohort ages dif-ferently, general aging changes tend to remainstable. In this chapter we will review the agingprocess of each of the body's major physiologicalsystems. We ask, however, that the reader remainmindful that physiological aging is an extremelyindividual process and that how the body ages isgreatly affected by a person's genetic makeup,health behaviors, and availability of resources. The Cardiovascular System The heart and associated vasculature connects toevery organ system in the body, maintainingoxygen levels, supplying nutrients, and filteringtoxins. The structural and functional abilities ofthe cardiovascular system are crucial to sustain-ing the human body. Age-related changes to thecardiovascular structure and function will beevaluated in this section. Overview of the CardiovascularStructure and Function The heart contains four chambers consisting of thetwo upper atria and the two lower ventricles(Digiovanna, 2000). Blood from the venous sys-tem enters the two atria. Oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left atrium and deoxygenatedblood from the body enters the right atrium.Blood then flows into the ventricles , from which it is pumped into the aorta and connected arter- ies(Digiovanna, 2000). The left ventricle expels oxygen-rich blood into the aorta for delivery to theentire body, excluding the lungs. The right ven-tricle expels oxygen-poor blood into pulmonaryarteries that carry the blood to the lungs for reoxy-genation (Digiovanna, 2000; Moore et al., 2003).When ventricles contract, blood fills and stores inthe arteries during systole , or peak blood pressure. Once the ventricles relax during diastole , or low rate blood pressure, blood is propelled into thecapillaries (Digiovanna, 2000; Pugh & Wei,2001; Moore, Mangoni, Lyons, & Jackson, 2003). Larger arteries are associated with the struc- ture and function of the heart whereas smallerarteries and arterioles are associated with sys-temic structure and function. The arterial sys-tem as a whole is responsible for the qualities ofpressure and resistance that are characteristic ofthe cardiovascular system (Moore et al., 2003).The veins carry over half of the total blood in thecardiovascular system and are associated withthe qualities of volume and conformity (Mooreet al., 2003).

The main function of the cardiovascular sys- tem is to maintain homeostasis by transferringoxygen, nutrients, and hormones to other organsystems. The cardiovascular system also providesdefense mechanisms through lymph nodes andwhite blood cells. In addition, this physiologi-cal system regulates body temperature as well asacid-base balance within the range of pH 7.35to 7.45 (Digiovanna, 2000). Figure 6-3 illus- trates the pathway of oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted blood circulation to correspondingorgans and body areas. Aging Changes inCardiovascular Structure Cardiac AgingEnlargement of heart chambers and coronary cellsoccurs with age, as does increased thickening ofheart walls, especially in the left ventricle (Priebe,2000; Pugh & Wei, 2001; Weisfeldt, 1998). Thisenlargement and thickening causes a decline in28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 148 The Cardiovascular System 149 ventricle flexibility (Pugh & Wei, 2001) and anoverall increase in heart weight of about 1.5 grams/year in women and 1.0 gram/year inmen measured from age 30 to age 90 years(Ferrari et al., 2003; Lakatta, 1996). Ventricles inthe heart also begin to thicken and stiffen in cor-relation with continued steady production of col-lagen. In addition, there is a decline in thenumber of myocardial cells and subsequent enlargement of the remaining cells (Ferrari et al.,Figure 6-3 The circulatory system. Source: Daniel D.

However,recent investigations have concluded that womenmaintain myocardial cell numbers with age(Olivetti et al., 2000). V ascular AgingAged arteries become extended and twisted.Alterations also occur in endothelial cells, andarterial walls thicken due to increased levels ofcollagen (Ferrariet al., 2003; Lakatta, 1999b; Virmani et al.,1991). arteries begin to stiffen,leading to hypertension pathophysiology char-acterized by increased blood velocity from theaorta to the systemic arterial system (Moore etal., 2003; Weisfeldt, 1998). Variable levels ofarterial stiffness occur depending on differentialchanges in elastin and collagen levels. The levelof arterial stiffness also depends on whether theaffected arteries are central elastic arteries orperipheral muscular arteries (Pugh & Wei,2001; Robert, 1999). Peripheral arteries canshow increased stiffness due to accumulatingmineral (calcium), lipid, and collagen residues(Lakatta, 1993a; Richardson, 1994; Robert,1999). Although arteries stiffen due to alter-ations in elastin and collagen, arterioles undergoatrophy, affecting their ability to expand withpressure alterations (Richardson, 1994). Although the aorta and other arteries begin to stiffen with age, the left ventricle pumps thesame amount of blood. This combination ofarterial stiffening and stable blood flow resultsin increased wave velocity of blood travelingtoward the arterial system and toward the aorta.If blood returns to the aorta before the aorticvalve can shut there is a resultant increase in sys-tolic and arterial blood pressure and aorta remains greater in womenthan in men until menopause, at which timeaortic flexibility declines. However, estrogenreplacement recovers some of the lost aorticexpandability (Hayward, Kelly, & Collins,2000; Rajkumar et al., 1997). Overall vascular tone tends to decline with age due to deterioration in endothelium regula-tion of vascular relaxation (Pugh & Wei, 2001;Quyyumi, 1998). All four cardiac valves increasein circumference in older adults with the great-est increase occurring in the aortic valve. In addi-tion, calcium deposits accrue in the valves andmay lead to stenosis (Pugh & Wei, 2001; Roffe,1998; Tresch the cardiac conduction the sino- atrial (SA) node demonstrates some fibrosis aswell as loss of pacemaker cells to approximately10% of those observed at age 20 (Lakatta,1993a; Wei, 1992). Also with age, the atroven-tricular (AV) node may be affected by nearbycalcification of cardiac muscle (Pugh & Wei,2001). In contrast to those of the arterial system,age-related changes to the venous system havenot been well described in the literature (Mooreet 2003). 6-1 summarizes cardiovas- cular age-related Aging MechanismsFinding the mechanism responsible for the agingof the cardiovascular system could lead to inter-ventions and therapies aimed at reducing theage-associated physiological factors that altercardiovascular structure and functioning. Somepotential mechanisms include free radicals,apoptosis, inflammatory processes, advanced gly-cation end products, and gene expression (Pugh28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 150 The Cardiovascular System 151 & Wei, 2001). Free radicals have been implicatedin the overall aging process of the body, asdescribed in Chapter 3 and also mentioned inthis chapter under \"The Aging Brain.\" The pres-ence of lipofuscin , a brown pigment found in aging cells, relates to oxidative mechanisms. Incombination with mitochondrial dysfunction,lipofuscin may result in the increased productionof free radicals (Roffe, 1998; Wei, 1992). Increased levels of free radicals can foster apoptosis, or cell death. Due to the very limitedregenerative properties of cardiomyocytes, orheart cells, apoptosis can have detrimental effectson cardiovascular structure and functioning(Pugh & Wei, 2001). The proposed triggers forinduction of apoptosis include elevated levels ofnoradrenaline and initiation of the renin-angiotensin system with age (Sabbah, 2000).Another possible trigger for apoptosis is geneexpression, which causes changes in the messen-ger RNA (mRNA) associated with the sar-coplasmic reticulum ATPase(Lakatta, 1993a). These alterations inthe sarcoplasmic reticulum and ATPase. These alterations, in turn, lead to functional changes inrelaxation of the heart and diastolic filling(Lakatta, 1993a; & Wei,2001). Aging mechanisms with theheart continue to be researched in depth, hope-fully leading to new insights in the near future. Aging Changes inCardiovascular Function Cardiac AgingAccording to several studies, the ability of theheart to exert force or to contract does not changewith age (Gerstenblith et al., 1997; Rodehefferet At rest, the agingTable 6-1 Summarization of Cardiovascular Structural and Functional Changes that Occur with Age Structural changes with age Functional changes with age No change with ageDecreased myocardial cells, decreased aortic distensibility, decreasedvascular toneIncreased heart weight, increased myocardial cell size, increased leftventricle wall thickness, increased artery stiffness, increased elastinlevels, increased collagen levels, increased left atrium sizeDecreased diastolic pressure (during initial filling), decreased diastolicfilling, decreased reaction to /H9252-adrenergic stimulus Increased systolic pressure, increased arterial pressure, increased wavevelocity, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, elongationof muscle contraction phase, elongation of muscle relaxation phase,elongation of ventricle relaxationEjection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac output, overall systolicfunction28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 151 152 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems heart adapts and maintains necessary function-ing quite efficiently (Pugh & Wei, 2001).Although the ability of the cardiac muscle toexert force does not change with age, the actualmuscle contraction as well as the relaxation phasedoes elongate with age (Lakatta, 1993a; Lakatta,Gerstenblith, Angell, Shock, & Weisfeldt, 1975;Roffe, 1998; Schulman, 1999). The prolongedcontraction and relaxation phases with age cor-relate with extended release of calcium as well asdecline in calcium reuptake (Roffe, 1998). Ventricles also experience prolonged relaxation due to age-related declines in the sarcoplasmicreticulum pump and associated enzyme ATPase,which produces energy for the cardiovascular sys-tem (Lompre, 1998; Pugh & Wei, 2001). The leftatrium in the heart enlarges, contributing tofunctional changes in the filling rate. Further-more, research has demonstrated that increasedarterial stiffness along with the extended relax-ation period leads to increased left ventricularend-diastolic pressure. This is demonstrated bya decline in pressure at the beginning of diastolicfilling and an increase in pressure during latediastolic filling (Kane, Ouslander, & Abrass,1999; 2001; Roffe, 1998). With age, diastolicfilling declines at a rate of approximately 6% to7% each decade both during exercise and at rest,but diastolic heart failure rarely occurs (Schulman,1999). Increased left ventricle mass has been cor-related with age-related declines in initial dias-tolic filling (Salmasi, Alino, Jepson, & Dancy,2003). The increase in left ventricular mass cor-relates with increased total blood flow and ele-vated systolic blood pressure (Weisfeldt, 1998).However, no age-related change occurs in ejec-tion fracture, Radaelli, does not appear to change the overall max-imum capacity, the maximum vasodilation, or theperfusion of coronary vessels (Weisfeldt, 1998).However, resistance increases with age in theaorta, arterial wall, and vascular periphery. Inaddition, blood viscosity increases between theages of 20 and 70 years (Morley & Reese, 1989).Cardiovascular symptoms of hypertension paral-lel the usual aging changes seen in older adults.Such symptoms, however, are exhibited atyounger ages as well and are sometimes exagger-ated. These differences have led to use of the termmuted hypertension to describe cardiovascular aging changes (Lakatta, 1999b). Other changes such asmoderate accumulation of cardiac amyloid andlipofuscin do not appear to alter functional abili-ties, but they are present in approximately half ofindividuals over age 70, and elevated levels couldproduce degenerative changes (Pugh & Wei,2001). No age-related changes occur in blood-tissue exchange via the capillaries, suggesting apossible compensatory mechanism such as capil-lary thickening (Richardson, 1994). Autonomic Nervous System AgingEffectsA few of the age-related changes in the cardio-vascular system occur in the autonomic ner- vous system . These changes include decreased reaction of the entire system, myocardial andvascular, to /H9252-adrenergic stimulus as well as reduced baroreflex activity relating to an imbal-ance in over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system.This overactivation subsequently leads to over-stimulation of /H9252-adrenoceptors , even to the28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 152 The Cardiovascular System 153 point of desensitization (Esler, Kaye, et al.,1995; Lakatta, 1993b, 1999a; Moore usual however,stimulation of the /H9252-adrenoceptors triggers ves- sel dilation. In contrast, (Priebe, 2000; Weisfeldt, 1998). Reducedarterial baroreflex which controls been correlated with sev-eral changes including arterial stiffening, neu-ral modifications, and decreased stimulation ofbaroreceptors (Hunt, Farquar, & Taylor, 2001). These changes in baroreflex activity can lead toimpaired sympathetic nerve response and resis-tance in peripheral vessels. As a result, bloodpressure becomes unstable and hypotension mayresult (Ferrari et al., 2003). Table 6-1 summa-rizes age-associated changes in the functionalabilities of the cardiovascular system. Exercise and AgingWhen older adults exercise, the cardiovascularresponse is different than the response of youngerindividuals. Cardiovascular condition duringexercise is usually measured using maximumoxygen consumption (VO 2max), which equals the sum of cardiac output and systemic oxygen reserve. VO2maxshows age-related declines of around 10% per decade beginning in the seconddecade of life and reductions of around 50% byage 80 (Aronow, 1998; Maharam, Bauman,Karlman, Skolnick, & Perle, 1999). Cardio-vascular reserve is best measured using maxi-mum cardiac output, which is equal to heart ratemultiplied by stroke volume during exercise(Fleg, 1986). For example, with age theincreased heart rate and contractility usuallyassociated with exercise become less pronounced;however, opposition to blood flow increases(Weisfeldt, 1998). With these changes an over-all decline in cardiac function and cardiac outputis observed with initiation of exercise (Pugh &Wei, 2001; Weisfeldt, 1998). A number of individuals from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study, aged 20 to 80 years andwithout heart disease, participated in an exerciseprogram so that their cardiovascular function-ing could be assessed (Rodeheffer et al., 1984).The researchers conducting this study observedand concluded that when older adults began toexercise their heart rate did not respond as well,a greater end systolic volume existed, and heartcontractility declined. However, as these olderadults continued to exercise, the end diastolicvolume increased, producing greater strokevolume and ending with an unchanged cardiacoutput. Other research has shown similar con-clusions with exercise including decreased heartrate and contractility, decreased peak heart rateand ejection fraction, decreased end-systolic vol-ume, increased end-diastolic volume, and pre-served stroke volume, further supporting thefindings of increased left ventricle end-diastolicvolume and maintained cardiac output duringexercise (Fleg pressure (Lind &McNicol, 1986). Salmasi and colleagues (2003)conducted a research study involving 55 patientsless than 50 years of age and 45 patients greaterthan 50 years of age and evaluated them for leftventricle diastolic function at rest and during iso-metric exercise. These researchers concluded thatdegeneration in left ventricle diastolic function-ing occurred in the 50 year and older group bothat rest and during isometric exercise due to ven-tricle stiffening leading to decreased diastolic fill-ing initially (Salmasi et al., 2003). Conclusionson cardiovascular change with exercise must be28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 153 154 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Table 6-2 Lifestyle Interventions to Maintain or Improve Physiological Functioning in Aging Physical activity 1.

Some research studies comparingcardiovascular function across different agecohorts do not take into account nutrition prac-tices, exercise regimens or lack thereof, and othereffects such as the lifestyle of older adults acrosstime and space compared to younger individuals(Lakatta, 1999b). For example, older adults todayoften will say they grew up on a farm with largemeals and a lack of concern for fat content; how-ever, younger individuals today are very healthconscience with tremendous focus on fat and calo-ries. Nutrition and exercise habits as well as otherhealth-related practices continually change overtime, which brings up the question of how com-parable younger individuals are to older individ-uals in terms of cardiovascular functioning. The Respiratory System The respiratory system refers to the parts of thebody involved in breathing. This system worksin close collaboration with the cardiovascularsystem to provide the body with a continuoussupply of oxygen necessary to produce energyand to eliminate unwanted carbon dioxide. Thisgaseous exchange is vital to life and, hence,proper functioning of the respiratory system andits constituent parts is critical to human survival. Structure and Function of theRespiratory System The respiratory system is composed of themouth, nose, pharynx, trachea (or windpipe),and lungs, as well During respiration ( Figure 6-4a ), oxy- gen first passes through the mouth and nasalpassages where it is filtered of any large con-taminants. It then enters the pharynx where it absorbs water vapor and is warmed. The oxygenthen flows through the trachea, a tube extend-ing into the chest cavity, and into two smallertubes called the bronchi, each of which splitsinto tubes called the bronchioles. Oxygen flowsthrough the bronchi into the bronchioles andthen into the lungs through many smaller tubescalled alveolar ducts. From the alveolar ducts,oxygen air sacs calledalveoli (Figure 6-4b ), of which there are approximately 600 million in the average,healthy adult lung (Krauss Whitbourne, 2002).The alveoli are the functional units of the lungsand the site of gas exchange. Once in the alve-oli, oxygen is diffused through the capillariesinto the blood. The blood then carries the oxy-gen to the cells of the body. Carbon dioxide exitsthe body through the same, albeit reverse, path-way through which oxygen entered. The lungs are composed of elastic tissue that allows them to expand and contract duringinhalation and exhalation, respectively. Themeasure of the lungs' ability to expand and con-tract is known as elastic recoil . The alveoli are also composed of elastic tissue, granting themthe same expansion and contraction propertiesas the lungs themselves. The more the alveoli canexpand and contract, the more oxygen they can bring in and the more carbon dioxide they canexpel. The alveoli also secrete a substance knownas surfactant, which reduces the surface tensionwithin the lungs. This reduction in surface ten-sion helps to keep the lungs from collapsing aftereach breath. Hence, surfactant aids in maintain-ing lung stability. Respiration is highly controlled by respira- tory muscles, including the diaphragm and rib muscles. The diaphragm is a sheet of mus-cles located across the bottom of the chest.Respiration occurs with contraction and relax-ation of the diaphragm and the rib muscles. Toallow for the intake of oxygen, the rib musclescontract and push the ribs up and out while thediaphragm contracts and is pulled downward.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 155 156 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems These muscle contractions increase the volumeof the chest cavity and reduce pressure withinthe cavity. The change in volume and pressureallows oxygen to be sucked into the lungs.Upon relaxation of the diaphragm and ribmuscles, the lung tissue and the ribs relax.Consequently, the volume of the chest cavitydecreases while its pressure increases and car-bon dioxide is forced out of the lungs. Respiratory function is measured in terms of both lung volumes and lung capacities. Thenames and definitions of these various measure-ments are presented in Table 6-3 and Figure 6-5. This table and figure should be referred to throughout the following discussion of age-related changes in the respiratory system. Aging of the Respiratory System AlveoliAs a person ages, the alveoli of the lungs becomeflatter and shallower, and there is a decrease inthe amount of tissue dividing individual alve-oli. In addition, there is a decrease in the alveo-lar surface area. A person 30 years of age has analveolar surface area of approximately 75 squareFigure 6-4(a) The respiratory system. Source: Robert E. Clark, Anatomy and physiology: Understanding the human body. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005. Pharynx (throat)Nasal 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 156 The Respiratory System 157 meters. This surface area decreases by 4% perdecade thereafter. Because gas exchange occursover the surface of the alveoli, the age-relatedreduction in alveolar surface area impairs effi-cient passage of oxygen from the alveoli to theblood (De Martinis & Timiras, 2003).Lung ElasticityWith age there is a decrease in the lungs' elastic-ity, which in turn causes a change in the elasticrecoil properties of the lungs. During expiration,elastic recoil helps to keep the lungs open untilall air is expelled and the lungs are forced to col-lapse due to the action of the respiratory muscles.Loss of elastic recoil causes the lungs to close pre-maturely, trapping air inside and preventing thelungs from emptying completely. As a result,unexpired air remains in the lungs and, conse-quently, during the next inhalation less air canbe inspired (Krauss Whitbourne, 2002). Despitethe reduced inspiratory capacity, total lung capacity \u2014the maximum volume to which the lungs can expand during greatest inspiratoryeffort\u2014remains virtually unchanged with age.After adjustment for age-related decreases inheight, total lung capacity of both men and wo-men decreases by less than 10% between the agesof 20 and 60 years (De Martinis & Timiras, 2003).Figure 6-4(b) Alveolar structure.

Due to the effects ofgravity, more blood flows through the lower thanthe upper portion of the lungs. However, becauseof the reduced ability of the aging lungs to expandduring inhalation, less air reaches the lower por-tion of the lungs. Air is more likely to flowthrough the upper portion of the lungs. Yet, it isthe lower lung that has a greater capillary networkand blood supply for oxygen delivery. Thus, thedecrease of air flow through the lower lung resultsin less efficient delivery of oxygen to the body.Consequently, as individuals age they mustbreathe in more air in order to achieve the sameamount of gas exchange, a task that is difficult toaccomplish with a loss of lung elasticity. Thissame upper-lower lung disparity is seen in youngpeople. However, because of their greater lungelasticity, younger individuals are better able tocompensate for the disparity by bringing more airinto the lungs (Krauss Whitbourne, 2002).The Chest W allThe chest wall becomes stiffer with advancingage. The increase in stiffness is largely due to aloss of rib elasticity as well as age-related calci-fication of the cartilage that attaches the ribs tothe breastbone. The stiffness of the chest reducesTable 6-3 Respiratory Volumes and Capacities Volumes Definition Age-Related Changes Tidal volume (TV)Inspiratory reserve volume(IRV)Expiratory reserve Functional residual capacity(FRC)Amount of air inspired and expiredduring a normal breathAmount of air that can be inspiredafter maximum inspirationAmount of air that can be expired aftermaximum expirationAmount of air remaining in the lungsfollowing maximum expirationAmount of air that can be forcefullyexpelled in one secondDefinitionMaximum capacity to which the lungscan expand during maximuminspiratory effortAmount of air that can be expelledfollowing maximum inspirationMaximum amount of air that can beinspired after reaching the end of anormal expirationAmount of air remaining in the lungsfollowing a normal expiration DecreaseDecreaseDecreaseIncreaseDecreaseAge-Related ChangesNo changeDecreaseDecreaseIncrease28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 158 The Respiratory System 159 its ability to expand during inhalation and con-tract during exhalation. As a result, older personsoften rely heavily on the diaphragm for expan-sion and contraction of the chest cavity whenthey breathe (Digiovanna, 1994). However, thediaphragm may weaken by up to 25% (Beers &Berkow, 2000) with age. This weakening, com-bined with an age-associated loss of overall mus-cle mass, reduces the contractual abilities of thediaphragm, limiting respiration. Changes in Respiratory MeasuresAs a result of the age-related changes in lungtissue and the chest wall, the respiratory systemof older adults is less able to provide sufficientgas exchange to meet the body's demand foroxygen, particularly at times of maximum phys-ical exertion (Arking, 1998). This insufficiencyis demonstrated by age-related changes in res-piratory measures (Table 6-3). Research has shown that vital capacity \u2014the maximum amount of air that can be expelledfollowing a maximum inspiration\u2014decreaseswith advancing age. Between the ages of 20 and70 years, vital capacity is reduced by approxi-mately 40% (Krauss Whitbourne, 2002), and insome cases vital capacity in the seventh decademay decrease to almost 75% of its value at 17 years of age (De Martinis & Timiras, 2003).Residual volume, however, increases nearly 50%Source: Reprinted from Human physiology: Foundations & frontiers (2nd ed.), D.

Thisincrease, in combination with reduced vitalcapacity, leads to a reduction in the amount ofair that can be inspired. In addition, any freshair that is inhaled is mixed with stale, residualair. This mixing, together with diminishedinhalation, contributes to the lungs' reducedability to deliver sufficient oxygen to the body(Krauss Whitbourne, 2002). Residual volume is inversely related to forced expiratory volume (FEV) , the amount of air that can be forcefully expelled in 1 second.As residual volume increases, FEV decreases.Thus, evidence supporting a marked decrease inFEV with age is congruent with the age-relatedincrease in residual volume (Arking, 1998). Another respiratory measure known to change with age is the ventilatory rate , or the minute respiratory rate. Ventilatory rate isdefined as the volume of air inspired in a normalbreath (i.e., tidal volume) multiplied by the fre-quency of breaths per minute. At low levels ofexertion, age does not appear to have any effecton ventilatory rate. However, at maximal exer-tion levels the ventilatory rate shows an age-related decline. Young adult males have amaximum capacity for inspiration of about 125to 170 liters of air per minute, but this rate canbe sustained for only approximately 15 seconds.A ventilatory rate of 100 to 120 liters of air perminute can be maintained for prolonged periodsof time. However, by the age of 85 years, theventilatory rate has decreased to approximately75 liters per minute (Arking, 1998). Age-Related Pathologies of theRespiratory System The proportion of deaths due to respiratory diseaseis at its highest, approximately 30%, in the firstyear of life. By late adolescence and early adulthoodonly about 5% of deaths are attributed to respira-tory disease. However, from the fifth decade of lifeon, there is a steady increase in the incidence of res-piratory disease, and among persons over 85 yearsof age, respiratory disease accounts for 25% of alldeaths (De Martinis & Timiras, 2003). Two of themost prevalent respiratory diseases among olderadults are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and pneumonia.Chronic Obstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD)COPD is encompasseschronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchi-tis, and emphysema, or a combination of these dis-orders (Barnes, 2000). The pathology of COPD ischaracterized by a decreased ability of the lungs torespire properly. Environmental irritants such ascigarette smoke promote the production of exces-sive amounts of mucus within the airways. As thismucus builds up, the airways become restricted.The result is inefficient respiration in which exces-sive air accumulates in the alveoli, causing themto remain perpetually inflated. This constantinflation damages the alveolar walls, and the bodyrepairs this damage by replacing the normallyelastic tissue with fibrous tissues that are muchless permeable to gas exchange. In addition, thefibrous tissue decreases elastic recoil, further con-tributing to inefficient and difficult respiration(Arking, 1998). Individuals with COPD oftenexperience excessive cardiac workload as the hearttries to compensate for impaired airflow by pump-ing more blood to the lungs (Arking, 1998). PneumoniaPneumonia is characterized by lung inflamma-tion generally brought on by infection. Theimpaired immune response with age (see \"TheImmune System\" later in this chapter) is thought28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 160 The Gastrointestinal System 161 to play a significant role in the high prevalenceof pneumonia seen among elderly persons.Older individuals are more susceptible to severepneumonia and complications of pneumoniathan are younger persons. In addition, mortal-ity from pneumonia is known to be as high as80% in those ages 60 years and older (Naughton,Mylotte, & Tayara, 2000). The Gastrointestinal System Aging in Key Components of theGastrointestinal Tract Overall, the gastrointestinal system ( Figure 6-6 ) appears to be relatively preserved in aging withonly minor changes. The two gastrointestinalareas most affected by age are the upper tract (thepharynx and esophagus ) and the colon , also referred to as the large intestine (Hall, 2002).Changes in the gastrointestinal system can havemultiple and varied effects, including effectsupon consumption and absorption of nutrientsand waste secretion. In this section, age-relatedchanges of the gastrointestinal system, from themouth to the large intestine and the accompa-nying glands and organs, will be evaluated.The MouthThe gastrointestinal system begins at the mouth,which shows some signs of age-related changesthat affect the ability to chew. Changes in tastealso occur, as described in this chapter's \"TheNervous System\" section. The mouth is utilizedfor mastication, or chewing. It is responsible formoistening food with saliva. The chewing andmoistening of food allows for easier passage ofthe processed content to the pharynx and esoph-agus (Arking, 1998; Hall & Wiley, 1999). Dental decay and tooth loss affect many older individuals today, making it more difficult tochew and prepare food to be swallowed (Hall &Wiley, 1999). Age-related changes in teeth causethem to be less sensitive and more brittle (Devlin& Ferguson, 1998). However, in the near futuretooth decay and loss may decline due to increasedhealth awareness, improved dentistry practices,and higher availability of fluoride toothpaste andfloss that were not available when today's gen-eration of older adults was maturing. With age, there is atrophy of those muscles and bones of the jaw and mouth that controlmastication. Consequently, it is more difficultfor older adults to chew 1993). Along with changesin the skeletal muscle, changes occur in thenerves that innervate the oral region. As a result,there is some change in the ability of the nervesand muscle to coordinate functioning(Digiovanna, 2000). Refer to \"The Muscle\" laterin this chapter for additional informationregarding aging changes in skeletal muscle. Saliva produced and secreted by salivary glands and the oral mucosa assists in removingfood from teeth, neutralizing acid, replacing min-erals in enamel, inhibiting bacteria and fungigrowth, and breaking down starch molecules(Devlin & Ferguson, 1998; Digiovanna, 2000).Salivary flow is controlled by the autonomic ner-vous system and is influenced by food touchingthe mouth, by jaw movement and by olfactionand gustation input (Bourdiol, Mioche, & Monier,2004; Digiovanna, 2000). Although almost 40%of older adults complain of dry mouth, salivarygland function remains stable with age due to thelarge secretory reserve in the main salivary glands(Bourdiol et Devlin & Ferguson, 2003; Tepper & Sigmoid colonDuodenum of small intestine162 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Figure 6-6 The gastrointestinal system.

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 162 The Gastrointestinal System 163 mouth can be attributed to prescription and over-the-counter medications, nutritional deficiencies,disease, and treatment therapies such as chemo-therapy (Devlin & Ferguson, 1998; Ghezzi & Ship,2003; Ship, Pillemer, & Baum, 2002). The EsophagusA study in 1964 showing impaired esophagealmotility function in older individuals led to thedevelopment of the term presbyesophagus ; how- ever, the study included many individuals withdiseases such as diabetes and neuropathy thatconfounded the findings (Soergel, Zboralske, &Ambers, 1964). Studies have since demonstratedpreservation of esophageal functioning in aginguntil around age 80, when some changes occur.These changes include decline in upperesophageal sphincter pressure, increased time forthe upper esophageal sphincter to relax, anddecreased intensity of esophageal contractionspotentially caused by loss of muscle abilities andnerve Chen,2002; Schroeder & Richter, 1994). The loweresophageal sphincter was once thought todemonstrate age-related declines in contractionsand impaired relaxation; however, recent workhas shown that no real changes occur to the lowersphincter (Hall & Wiley, 1999). Swallowing is controlled by the brain through cortical input to the medulla swallow-ing centers that have nerve endings in the skele-tal muscle controlling the pharynx andesophagus (Hall & Wiley, 1999). The esophagusalso contains smooth muscle that is controlledby nerve endings from the intestines and by thevagus nerve in the brain (Hall & Wiley, 1999).Rao and colleagues (2003) conducted a studyevaluating sensory and mechanical changes inboth skeletal and smooth muscle located in theesophagus and found that older adults demon-strated stiffening of the esophageal wall and lesssensitivity to discomfort and pain in the esoph-agus. These changes affect the ability to swallowin the older patient. The gag reflex also appearsto be absent in around 40% of healthy olderadults (Davies, Kidd, Stone, & MacMahon,1995). Dysphasia (difficulty swallowing), reflux,heartburn, and chest pain are common com-plaints that relate to changes in the pharynx andesophagus. Approximately 35% of older indi-viduals report such complaints (Hall & Wiley,1999; Orr & Chen, 2002; Reinus & Brandt,1998; Shaker, Dua, & Koch, 1998). The StomachAge-related declines in peristaltic contractionsand stomach emptying do not appear Ferrara, Bucceri,Lanteri, & Graff(2004) assessing gastrointestinal motility inaging concluded that no changes in gastricemptying occurred with age. Furthermore,enteric nerves or nerves innervating the intes-tinal system that control gastric motility do notchange with age (Madsen & Graff, 2004). Theonly change that has been observed is slowergastric emptying in premenopausal women ascompared to postmenopausal women and men.This premenopausal decline in gastric empty-ing is causally linked to progesteronelevels during the menstrual (Gryback etal., 2000; Petring & Flachs, 1990). Gastric appear to change with age,but pepsin, bicarbonate, and sodium ion secre-tions and prostaglandin content do show age-related decline (Hall & Wiley, 1999). Thesesecretion changes cause a decline in gastricdefense mechanisms and create an increasedpotential for mucosal injury in the stomach(Hall & Wiley, 1999). 28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 163 164 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems The Small IntestineSmall intestine motility needed for digestionand absorption of nutrients has been reported toshow no change or only minor changes in con-traction intensity with age (Brogna et al., 1999;O'Mahony et al., 2002; Orr & Chen, 2002;Shaker et al., 1998). Madsen & Graff (2004) alsodiscovered no age-related change in small intes-tine transit rate (the time needed for digestedmaterial to move through the length of thesmall intestine). This finding supports resultsfrom other studies. The endocrine and nervoussystem aid in motility functioning in the intes-tines, and any changes in these specific systemscould potentially cause changes in intestinalabilities (Shaker et al., 1998). However, no clin-ically significant motility changes appear tooccur in the small intestine with age. Bacterial overgrowth related to the small intestine is a common clinical finding in theolder population, causing malabsorption andmalnutrition; however, these symptoms are notdue to age changes, but are related to motilitydisturbance in the small intestine (Madsen &Graff, 2004; O'Mahony et al., 2002; Orr &Chen, 2002). Absorption of nutrients does notchange with age. Changes in vitamin absorptionare seen with particular vitamins but not others(Hall & Wiley, 1999). For instance, vitamin Aabsorption increases in older adults whereas vita-min D, zinc, and calcium absorption decreases.Absorption of vitamins B 1, B12, C, and iron does not change with age (Baik & Russell, Katz, 1998). The Large IntestineThe large intestine, also referred to as the colon,measures approximately 5 feet long whenstretched out and covers the area from the smallintestine to the anus (Digiovanna, 2000). Inaging, a loss of enteric, or intestinal, neurons anda loss of inhibitory nerve connection to the smoothmuscle in the colon occur. These losses causechanges in motility via a decreased ability toinhibit colonic contractions and/or by decreasedcolonic relaxation (Shaker et al., 1998). Madsen &Graff (2004) concluded that older adults experi-ence longer colonic transit time (the amount oftime needed for fluid and excrement to travel thelength of the colon). This change again relates toage-related loss of neurons and receptors in theenteric nervous system. Increased colonic transittime also correlates with increased fibrosis in thecolon (Hall, 2002). Colonic pressure in the intra-lumen also increases with age, but can be loweredwith fiber supplementation (Hall, 2002). The rectum, a colonic structure that is located before the anus, shows an age-related increase infibrous tissue. This increase reduces the rectum'sability to stretch as feces pass through (Digiovanna,2000). In the anus, the external anal sphinctershows an age-related in motor neuronsresponsible for sphincter control. This sphincteralso thins with age. However, the internal analsphincter thickens with age, possibly as a com-pensatory mechanism. Nonetheless, it shows adecline in contractile anal sphincter changes due to laxity of thepelvic floor, decreased pressure in the rectum,and even menopause (Hall, 2002). Aging in Accessory Glands and Organs As people age relatively no changes occur in thesecretions of the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 164 The Gastrointestinal System 165 (Hall, 2002). However, these accessory glandsand organs, which work in close association withthe gastrointestinal system, remain crucial forintestinal stability. The LiverThe liver is the largest gland in the body and contributes to the conversion of food by secretingbile into the small intestine and by screeningblood from the stomach and small intestine fortoxic substances, excess nutrients, and ammonia(Digiovanna, 2000). With age, the liver's size aswell as its blood flow and perfusion can decreaseby 30% to 40%. In addition, hepatocytes, or livercells, can undergo structural alterations. However,due to the liver's large reserve capacity and thehepatocytes' ability to regenerate after damage, no functional changes result from the changes instructure (Digiovanna, 2000; Wynne et al., 1989). Decreased drug clear-ance in the older population can occur due to theobserved declines in liver size and blood flow aswell as age-related changes in the kidneys, butthis is highly variable among individuals (James,1998; Le Couteur & McLean, 1998; McLean & LeCouteur, 2004).The GallbladderThe gallbladder is a small sac located below the liver that stores the bile sent from the liver.Bile is stored until the gallbladder receivesintestinal and pancreatic signaling via the hor-mone cholecystokinin. This signaling indicatesa readiness for digestion and, in response, bileis released into the ducts of the small intestine(Digiovanna, 2000; MacIntosh et al., 2001).Refer to Figure 6-6 for the location andanatomical structure of the gallbladder. Withage, no overall structural changes occur in thegallbladder with the exception of the bile ducts(Digiovanna, 2000). However, in older adultsthe gallbladder appears to demonstrate declinesin emptying rates so that less bile is secretedwhen food is digested (Hall & Wiley, volume the gallbladder older adults.This increase in bile volume is more commonin older women than men (Bates, Harrison,Lowe, Lawson, & Padley, 1992; Hall & Wiley,1999). The bile ducts tend to widen with age,allowing potential gallstones to pass throughmore easily; however, the duct near the open-ing of the small intestine becomes narrower,trapping the gallstones and leading to abnor-mal changes (Digiovanna, 2000). The PancreasThe pancreas is a gland located below the stom- ach and above the small intestine. Refer to Figure6-6 for pancreatic location and structure. Thepancreas secretes pancreatic fluid that neutralizesstomach acid and accelerates the transport of largenutrients into ducts that eventually convergewith the bile duct leading the small intes-tine (Digiovanna, 2000; Hall & Wiley, 1999).The pancreas decreases in weight with age andshows some histological changes such as fibrosisand cell atrophy (Hall & Wiley, 1999). However,due to the large reserve capacity of the pancreas,the small changes that occur, including changesin the enzymes that aid in stomach acid neutral-ization and nutrient breakdown, do not affectoverall pancreatic function as a person ages(Digiovanna, 2000; Hall & Wiley, 1999). Gastrointestinal Immunity The with a mucosal liningcontaining immunological properties, is thelargest organ (Hall & Wiley, 1999). The immune28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 165 166 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems response in the gastrointestinal system dependson the congruent work of lymphoid and epithe-lial cells (Schmucker, Thoreux, & Owen, 2001).Secretion of antibodies into the intestinal mucosaworks to neutralize toxins, block bacteria fromadhering to surfaces, antigens fromcrossing the mucosa (Holt, 1992; Schmucker etal., 2001). Research has suggested a decline inimmunological function in the aging gastroin-testinal system. This decline can increase rates ofinfections that occur via the gastrointestinal sys-tem. Infection may, in turn, lead & Thoreux,2003). A decline in gastrointestinal immunity can be attributed to a change in lymphoid cellsor epithelial cells, or possibly both cell types(Schmucker et al., 2001). Although relatively few changes occur in the aging gastrointestinal system, changes that dooccur increase the risk for diseases and disorders.Age-related changes, compounded by otherinfluential factors such as comorbidity and med-ication use, place older individuals at increasedrisk for gallstones, constipation, fecal inconti-nence, and infection. The Genitourinary System Overview the GenitourinarySystem The genitourinary system ( Figure 6-7 ) in both males and females contains the kidneys and asso-ciated renal arteries and veins, the ureters , the bladder, and the urethra running through the genitalia (Digiovanna, 2000; Lindeman, 1995).The urinary system to maintain homeostasis , or bal- ance of the organ systems. For instance, the uri-nary system: 1) removes wastes and toxins suchas ammonia, uric acid, and some medications fromthe blood, 2) regulates osmotic pressure in theblood and interstitial fluid, 3) regulates concen-tration levels of calcium, sodium, potassium,magnesium, and phosphorus, 4) controls acid/basebalance by making necessary adjustments, 5) reg-ulates blood pressure, 6) activates vitamin D inorder to maintain calcium levels, and 7) regulatesoxygen level through stimulation of erythropoi-etin, the hormone responsible for increased redblood cell production in the bone marrow(Digiovanna, 2000; Lye, 1998). The kidneys formurine through a process of filtration, reabsorption,and secretion with constant homeostasis main-tained throughout the process (Digiovanna,2000). Under usual living conditions the kidneyscan be maintained on as little as 30% capacity, butunder stressful conditions such as high tempera-tures kidney reserves are needed to maintainproper functioning (Digiovanna, 2000). For age-related changes in genitalia, refer to the section\"The Reproductive System.\" In this section, agingstructural and functional changes in the urinarysystem will be evaluated. Urinary Structural Changes with Age The KidneysWith age, the kidneys shrink in length andweight. At 30 years of age, the average kidneyweighs 150 to 200 g. By age 90, weight hasdeclined to between 110 and 150 g (Beck, 1998,1999a; much as 30% to28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 166 The Genitourinary System 167 40% by age 90 due to glomerulosclerosis.Remaining glomeruli decrease in size butincrease the combination of the Bowman's capsule and renal tubule with the glomerulus,also decrease with age (Jassal & Oreopoulos,1998; Jassal et al., Minaker, 2004). Onaverage, renal blood flow declines 10% perdecade beginning as early as 20 years of age.Young adults (20 years) average a renal bloodflow of 600 ml/min whereas average blood flowin older adults (80 years) averages declines with age due tochanges in the arteries and capillaries in the kid-neys (Digiovanna, 2000; Jassal et al., 1998;McLean & Le Couteur, 2004). Renal blood flowin the cortical section of the kidneys declines ata much quicker rate compared to the averageFigure 6-7 The genitourinary system. Source: Daniel D. Chiras, Human biology (5th ed.).

This indicates that corticalnephrons are severely affected by age (Lindeman,1995). Changes in blood flow and glomerular fil- tration rate (GFR) account for a majority of func- tional disability in the kidneys with age. Withdisease and some medications, blood flow andGFR can be further compromised (Beck, 1999a;Digiovanna, 2000; Lindeman, 1995). The GFRvariably declines with age. This decline is meas-ured by creatinine or insulin clearance and usuallybegins in the third decade as a result of changes inglomeruli, clustering of capillaries, and renalblood flow rate al.,1998; McLean & Le Couteur, Tobin, Norris, & Shock, 1976). A declinein GFR becomes significant as people age becauseelimination of waste and toxins declines, causingan accumulation of harmful substances such asuric acid and medications in the body (Digio-vanna, 2000; McLean & Le Couteur, 2004). Renaltubules also show age-related changes, includingdecreased number also changes inthe kidneys are observed, the kidneys contain alarge reserve capacity, and functional abilitiesremain relatively stable unless stressed (Beck,1999a; Jassal et al., 1998; Minaker, 2004). The BladderThe bladder is a hollow organ lined with amucous membrane, contains smooth muscleincluding the detrusor muscle, and consists of two components, the bladder body and the base(Andersson & Arner, 2004; Kevorkian, 2004).With age, the bladder decreases in size anddevelops fibrous matter in the bladder wall,changing overall stretching capacity and con-tractibility (Digiovanna, 2000). The fillingcapacity of the bladder also declines along withthe ability to withhold voiding ability of the detrusor to con-tract declines in both aging men and women,and there is an increase in incidence of detrusoroveractivation (Diokno et al., 1988; Minaker,2004; Resnick et al., 1995). otherresearch has not shown any age-related changesin detrusor contractility, but has demonstratedthat the detrusor stablewith unchanged contractility and no observableobstructions (Elbadawi, Yalla, & Resnick, 1993;Madersbacher et al., 1998). 50% ofmen with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),the enlargement of the prostate causes obstruc-tion of the bladder outlet and results in urinarydysfunction (Resnick et al., 1995). In responseto bladder outlet obstruction, the bladder wallsbecome thicker and stronger in order to recom-pense for declining function (Elbadawi et al.,1998). Overall, the bladder goes through fewvariable structural changes with age, but thesechanges can impact a person physically. Ureters and the UrethraThe urinary system contains two ureters thatconnect each kidney to the bladder, but uretersdo not demonstrate any age-specific changes(Digiovanna, 2000). The urethra forms the canal that leads from the bladder out of the body and also functions inresponse to excitatory or the sphincter elevates from the prostateencompassing the urethra (Strasser et al., 1996).28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 168 The Genitourinary System 169 In the female, the urethra extends about 3 to 4cm. Males have longer urethras; this is due to theurethra's anatomical location in the penis(Digiovanna, 2000; Kevorkian, 2004). With age,the length of the urethra and the pressure neededto close off the urethra both decline in women(Elbadawi et al., 1998; Madersbacher et al., 1998;Resnick et al., 1995). Also, the urethra thins withage and striated muscle that controls sphinctersalso thins and weakens (Digiovanna, 2000;Kevorkian, 2004). In men, the prostate glandsurrounds the urethra directly below the bladder(see Figure 6-7) and prostate enlargement aroundthe bladder dys-function &Diokno, Urinary Functional Changeswith Age UrinationUrination involves both the central and peripheralnervous systems and requires that bladder con-traction and urethral relaxation occur simultane-ously (Andersson & Arner, 2004; Kevorkian,2004). The amount of urine expelled from thebody decreases with age correlating with increasesof around 50-100 ml postvoid residual (PVR)with age (Madersbacher et al., 1998; Minaker,2004). Renal changes affect the ability to concen-trate and the urine, causing electrolyteimbalance (Jassal & Muhlberg& Platt, 1999). Urine osmolality in the olderadult only reaches about half of that in a youngeradult, leading to increased water loss in the aged(Beck, 1999). Older individuals also experience anincrease in nocturia or an increased number of fluid voids occurring at night, which can disturbsleep patterns (Kirkland et al., 1983; Lubran,1995; Muhlberg & Platt, 1999; Asplund, 2004). Prostate volume increases in aging males, and it is possible that, with longevity, every male willexperience benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)(Madersbacher et al., 1998). BPH can lead to pro-static changes that influence lower urinary tractfunction as & Wessells,2005; Rosen et al., 2003). More specifically, inBPH the prostate enlarges enough to encroach onthe urethra and causing urinary retention,difficulty voiding, urinary tract infections, and, inadvanced stages, renal failure (Resnick et al.,1995; Hollander & Diokno, 1998). Nerve stim-ulations to the smooth muscle of the prostate,bladder, and urethra occur in BPH, causing void-ing difficulty. However, blocking the stimulusallows the muscle to relax, improving voidingabilities in BPH (Hollander & Diokno, 1998). (GFR), usuallymeasured by creatinine clearance, declines olderindividuals, but there is no resultant increase inblood creatinine concentration (Beck, 1999;Minaker, 2004). females.Measuring creatinine yield an accurateconcentration rate because 1) the creatinine pro-duction rate is variable, 2) the tubules also secretecreatinine, and 3) elders have decreased musclemass. Inaccuracy in measurement generally resultsin an overestimation of creatinine 1995;McLean & Le Couteur, 2004). The Cockcroft-Gault equation can be used to predict renal disease28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 169 170 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems but may not reflect the usual aging process. As aresult, use of the equation can lead to medicationunderdosing in healthy older adults and overdos-ing in compromised older adults (Fliser et al.,1997; Lubran, 1995; McLean & Le Couteur,2004; Rule et al., 2004). A closer estimation ofactual GFR from Muhlberg& Platt, 1999; Rule et al., 2004). Adverse drug reactions occur approximately 3 to 10 times more often in the older population ascompared to younger cohorts (Muhlberg & Platt,1999). Adverse drug reactions in the older popu-lation occur as a result of changes in the kidneys,more specifically changes in GFR and renal clear-ance. Adverse drug reactions can also occur due tochanges in tubular filtration (Abernathy, 1999;Muhlberg & Platt, 1999). Estimates of GFRamong older adults correlate with aging tubularfiltration and are often used to determine theamount of drug to use in the older population(Lindeman, 1990). The key phrase in geriatricpharmacy remains \"start low and go slow\" becauseof renal changes that affect pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics with age (Abernathy, 1999;Muhlberg & Platt, 1999). Furthermore, polyphar-macy and medication compliance are also associ-ated with increased adverse events in the olderpopulation (Abernathy, 1999). Homeostasis ChangesOverall, the aging kidneys function relatively fluid levels and electrolyte con-centration balance; however, age-related changesare more readily observed under ofstress such as dehydration and high temperatures(Arking, 1998; Minaker, 2004). Age-relatedstructural changes in the kidneys lead to somefunctional declines such as deterioration in theability to regulate sodium concentrations underusual conditions. In addition, there is a decline inthe ability to maintain sodium and potassiumhomeostasis and to conserve water during times of stress (e.g., dehydration) (Jassal & Oreopoulos,1998; Minaker, 2004). The inability to properlyregulate sodium can be attributed to malfunc-tioning of the ascending Loop of Henle in addi-tion to increases in prostaglandin levels andtubular unresponsiveness to aldosterone (Musso etal., 2004). A decline in overall potassium level inthe body also occurs with age due to low potas-sium secretion resulting from the decline in tubu-lar reaction & Oreopoulos,1998; Muhlberg & Platt, 1999; Musso et Older adults also experience changes in theability to reabsorb water and, in conjunction withdecreased thirst in older adults, the body canbecome dehydrated more quickly (Lye, 1998;Musso et al., 2004). Acid-base homeostasisappears to be relatively stable (pH 6.9 to 7.7) inolder adults under usual conditions; however,under conditions of acid overload older adults can-not excrete acid as quickly as younger adults(Lindeman, 1998; Muhlberg & Platt, 1999;Sorribas et al., 1995). The nephron functionallyserves the kidneys by balancing sodium and waterand eliminating waste from the bloodstream(Arking, 1998). With age, nephrons shrink in sizeand decrease in number. This is partly due todecreased blood flow in the glomeruli, whichcauses an increase levels 1998; Changes inhomeostasis can negatively impact both the struc-tural and functional capacity of the renal system.Hormone ChangesPlasma renin and aldosterone concentration lev-els gradually decline with age, beginning around40 years of age (Muhlberg & Platt, 1999). Withage, the renin-angiotensin system undergoes adecline in its ability to maintain salt levels fol-28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 170 The Reproductive System 171 lowing salt deprivation (Corman et al., 1995;Mimran, Ribstein, & Jover, 1992). In addition,the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis fails toadequately respond to hormone volume changesin healthy older adults without deprivation;therefore, maximum sodium levels cannot beattained (Beck, 1999; Muhlberg & Platt, 1999).During normal renal functioning, antidiuretichormone controls the diluting and concentratingof urine, ensuring that maximum levels of dilu-tion and concentration are attained (Muhlberg &Platt, 1999). Antidiuretic hormone releaseincreases in older adults in reaction to declininghormone volumes. This correlates with theincreased sensitivity of osmoreceptors anddecreased renal response (Jassal & Oreopoulos,1998). Aging changes also occur in the calcium-parathormone-vitamin D 3axis, as exhibited by decreased serum calcium levels, increasedparathyroid hormone levels resulting from GFRdecline, and declines in vitamin D metabolism bythe aging kidneys (Chapuy, Durr, & Platt, Vieth,Ladak, & Walfish, 2003). Due to the decline invitamin D metabolism by the kidneys, vitaminD supplementation is usually recommended inthe older population (Vieth et al., 2003). Age-related changes in the genitourinary sys- tem lead to alterations in genital structures,voiding behaviors, toxin and medication clear-ance, hormone levels, and overall physiologicalhomeostasis of the body. Overall structural andfunctional changes can be variable with age, butthese changes can impact a person physically,emotionally, psychologically, and socially, espe-cially when urinary function declines andbecomes abnormal, as seen with incontinence.Although aging changes in the kidneys can bevariable among older adults, as seen with GFR,as a whole these changes are quite common andshould be considered when evaluating and treat-ing an older population. The Reproductive System Female changes in the reproductive system aremost notably associated with the onset ofmenopause and subsequent declines in estrogen. Menopause and symptoms associated withmenopause serve as the physical reminder of repro-ductive aging, but underlying neuroendocrine andovarian changes occur years earlier. Male changesin the reproductive system are mostly associatedwith androgen deficiency and physical syndromessuch as impotency. However, changes in repro-ductive hormones affect not only the reproductivesystem, but also other physiological systems. Thissection will provide an overview of all of thechanges associated with reproductive aging inboth women and men. The reader should refer toFigures 6-8 and 6-9for an illustration of the female and male reproductive systems. Female Reproductive Aging Neuroendocrine FunctionThe reproductive axis refers to the integration of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads(ovaries for women). The axis controls repro-ductive hormones and ovulatory cycles(Chakraborty & Gore, 2004; Hall, 2004). Thehypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) , which binds to correspond- ing gonadotrope receptors in the pituitary,stimulating the synthesis and release of follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (Hall, 2004). FSH regulates androstenedione to estrogen. LH regulates28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 171 172 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Figure 6-8 The female reproductive system.

Reproductive function relies heav-ily on hormone signaling from the ovaries to thehypothalamus and pituitary as demonstrated byFSH secretion in the development of matureoocytes (Hall, 2004). The menstrual cycle func-tions on a negative feedback system, but alsorelies on positive feedback with estrogen in orderto produce the LH surge for ovulation (Hall,2004). Figure 6-10 demonstrates the menstru- ation cycle along with corresponding changes inovarian hormone levels throughout the cycle. Age-related changes in neuroendocrine func- tion include a change in gonadotropin levels. Thischange occurs before ovarian age-related changes,implicating involvement of the hypothalamus.With age, FSH levels begin increasing beforemenopause occurs and continue to increasethroughout and after menopause. Estradiol levelstend to increase right before and while transition-ing into menopause and then drastically decreaseduring menopause (Joffe, Soares, & Cohen, 2003).Inhibin B , a glycoprotein that usually suppresses FSH, also decreases in older women, explaining theobserved increase in FSH (Hansen et al., 2005;Klein et al., 1996; Santoro, Adel, & Skurnick,1999). Age-related changes circulating hor-mones, and progesterone, strongly affecthypothalamic and pituitary responses to positiveand negative hormone feedback systems. Finally,age-related changes occur in estrogen and pro-gestin receptors located in the brain. These changesoccur independently of changes in circulating hor-mone levels in the body (Chakraborty & Gore,2004; Gill, Sharpless, & Scherbaum, 1994). Age-related decline in estrogen affects the brain, resulting in some cognitive changes, insom-nia, or even depression. Estrogen decline alsoaffects other areas of the body that contain estro-gen receptors estrogen-dependent with decreased estrogen levels the skincontains less collagen and becomes thin, sweat andsebaceous glands become dry, hair follicles beginto dry, bones lose calcium and undergo increasedbone resorption, breasts lose connective tissue butgain adipose tissue, lipoproteins increase, bladderfunction decreases, cardiovascular function andblood pressure change, and the absorption andmetabolism of nutrients become less efficient(Smith, 1998; Wise et al., 1996). A majority ofthe emphasis concerning estrogen has been onneuroprotective effects, including delay of onset inAlzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as wellas protection against nerve cell death and braininjury (Roof & Hall, 2000; Wise, Dubal, Wilson,Rau, & Bottner, Wise, Dubal, Wilson, Rau,& Liu, 2001). Female System ChangesThe Ovaries. With age, the ovaries atrophy to such a small size that they can become impal-pable during an exam (Smith, 1998). The num-ber of ovarian follicles decreases with ageleading to a decline in fertility. This decline usu-ally begins in the 30s or 40s and more rapiddeclines occur after age 35 (Digiovanna, 2000;Hall, 2004; Smith, 1998). The ovarian folliclesthat remain through these declining years tendto be underdeveloped and only a few folliclesovulate and form a corpus luteum. Eventually,by the age of 50 to 65 years, a woman will haveno remaining viable follicles (Digiovanna, 2000;Smith, 1998; Wise et al., 1996). In the late reproductive years, around age 45, when fertility declines, FSH levels tend to increaseearlier in the follicular phase than they do amongyounger woman. The earlier decline in FSH28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 174 The Reproductive System 175 Figure 6-10 The menstrual cycle. Source: Daniel D. Chiras, Human biology (5th ed.).

The increase in FSH levels is attrib-uted to the drastic age-related decline in inhibinB, a glycoprotein synthesized in the ovaries thatsuppresses FSH secretion in younger individuals(Hall, 2004; Wise et al., 1996). This decline ininhibin B along with an increase in FSH estab-lishes the earliest age-related changes in theovaries (Hall, 2004). In the clinical setting, FSHvalues are determined at day 3 of the menstrualcycle in order to indicate the stage of reproduc-tive age (Hall, 2004). Reproductive aging causesa decline in estrogen due to a decrease in ovarianfollicles. A decline also occurs in progesterone(Chakraborty & Gore, 2004; Smith, 1998). Theovaries also produce about 25% of the testos-terone in women. The rest is supplied by theadrenal glands and conversion of androstene-dione, a testosterone precursor (Horton & Tait,1966; Yialamas & Hayes, 2003). However,testosterone in women is only about one-tenth ofthat found in men (Judd & Yen, 1973; Yialamas& Hayes, 2003). These changes in the ovaries,including ovarian failure and oocyte depletion,are causally linked to the triggering of meno-pause (Hall, 2004; Wise et al., 1996). The Uterus. Age-related decreases in uterine endometrial thickening during menstrual cyclesoccur as the result of decreased estrogen and pro-gesterone levels (Digiovanna, 2000). This thicken-ing leads to a decline in menstrual flow, eventuallycausing missed menstrual cycles and permanentcessation of ovulation and menstruation (Digio-vanna, 2000). The supporting ligaments attachedto the uterus are weakened with age, causing theuterus to tilt backward (Digiovanna, 2000). Overthe postmenopausal period the uterus decreases insize by as much as 50% and may become so smallas to be impalpable in women over the age of 75(Digiovanna, 2000; Smith, 1998). As a result ofstenosis and possible retraction, the cervix, thestructure at the opening of the uterus, may also beunidentifiable upon physical exam in postmeno-pausal women (Smith, 1998). The Vagina. With age, the vagina becomes shorter and narrower and the vagina walls tend tothin and weaken (Smith, 1998). These structuralchanges, especially thinning of the vaginal wallsand loss of elasticity, increase the chances for vagi-nal injury in the older female (Digiovanna,2000). A loss of mucosal layers in the vagina aswell as a large decrease in discharge causes a lossof lubrication. As a result, the vagina can becomevery dry, causing sexual intercourse to be painful(Digiovanna, 2000; Smith, 1998). With age,vaginal pH levels also shift an acidic envi-ronment (3.8-4.2) toward an alkaline environ-ment (6.5-7.5). The shift occurs due to decreasedglycogen levels in vaginal tissue, which results inan environment where microbes flourish (Digio-vanna, 2000; Smith, 1998). With all of thesechanges, vaginal infections tend to increase withage (Digiovanna, 2000). The increased rate ofinfection may also be due in part to shrinkage ofthe labia majora, part of the external genitalia. Asa result of this shrinkage, the labia become sepa-rated. This separation in turn exposes a greatersurface area upon which microbes and infectiousagents can nest (Digiovanna, 2000). MenopauseMenopause is classified as the complete cessationof menstrual cycles for a period of at least 1 year(Digiovanna, 2000; Hall, 2004; Soules et al.,2001). On average, menopause begins around 51years of age, but the reproductive changesdescribed in this section begin years earlier(Digiovanna, 2000; Hall, 2004; Joffe et al.,2003). The late reproductive stage begins around35 years of age with a decrease in fertilitymarked by a decrease in inhibin B, decrease in28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 176 The Reproductive System 177 progesterone, a slight increase in estradiol, andan increase in FSH (Hall, 2004; Joffe et al.,2003; Soules et al., 2001). The menopausal tran-sition is defined by declines in estradiol alongwith the onset of variable menstrual cycles inboth early and late stages. Periods of amenorrheatrigger the move into the late stage (Hall, 2004;Soules et al., 2001). Menopause is said to haveoccurred 1 year after the final menstrual period.The postmenopausal period is characterized bydrastic decreases in ovarian hormone functioningand changes in corresponding hormone-relatedsystems such as bone formation and resorption(Hall, 2004; Soules et al., 2001). Table 6-4 clas- sifies the stages of menopause along with corre-sponding changes that occur within each stage. Menopause is usually causally linked with ovarian failure and complete oocyte depletion,but recent research also implicates the hypothal-amus and pituitary via a decline in estrogen feedback LH release (Soules et al., 2001;Weiss, Skurnick, Goldsmith, Santoro, & Park, disease.

Estrogen and progesterone are still pres-ent in small amounts during early post-menopausal years, but ovarian production ofthese hormones eventually declines and ceasescompletely during late postmenopausal years(Chakraborty & Gore, 2004; Digiovanna, 2000).Estrogen levels decrease by 80% by post-menopausal years and progesterone decreases by60% (Smith, 1998). During menopause, ovariesdecrease production of androstenedione by 50%.This decline could help explain loss of libido andenergy in the older female (Yialamas & Hayes,2003). Although some studies have shown thatthere are slight declines in testosterone levelsduring and after menopause, others have shownno change in testosterone levels. Thus, the ques-tion of whether or not androgen deficiencyoccurs in Yialamas & Hayes, 2003;Zumoff, Strain, Miller, & Rosner, 1995). Physical symptoms that are often described by menopausal women include hot flashes,mood disturbance, weight gain, vaginal dryness,bladder infections, loss of sex drive, fatigue,insomnia, cognitive decline, hair loss, back-aches, and joint pain (Hafez & Hafez, 2004;Joffe et al., 2003). Aging effects on the entirereproductive axis contribute to reproductiveaging and eventual menopause in women. Table 6-4 Classification of the Stages of Menopause and the Characteristics Associated with Each Stage as Defined by STRAW Menopausal Reproductive Transition Menopause Postmenopause 200428438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 178 The Reproductive System 179 Male Reproductive Aging Neuroendocrine ChangesThe male reproductive axis also involves the inte-gration of the hypothalamus and pituitary, butfor males the gonad is the testes(Schlegel & Hardy, 2002; Yialamas & Hayes,2003). Similar to the female reproductive axis,the hypothalamus secretes GnRH into the blood.GnRH then travels to the pituitary where itstimulates the secretion the producetestosterone while the Sertolicells to initiate and maintain sperm production(Schlegel & Hardy, 2002; Seidman, 2003;Yialamas & Hayes, 2003). However, Sertoli cellshave the ability to suppress FSH secretion viainhibin B (Schlegel & Hardy, 2002). In males, anegative feedback system between the testes, thehypothalamus, and the pituitary controls the rateof sperm production and testosterone release.This is demonstrated by the relationship betweenFSH and Sertoli cells as well as by the effect oftestosterone on GnRH and gonadotropin secre-tion (Schlegel & Hayes, Testosterone is themost available androgen in the male reproductivesystem, with secretory bursts occurring aroundsix times per day (Partin & Rodriguez, 2002;Seidman, 2003). Testosterone binds to androgenreceptors located in the brain and spinal cord,activating cellular mechanisms that influenceandrogen-dependent tissues (Seidman, 2003). Age-related changes to the male reproductive axis include increases in FSH and LH levels,decreases in both serum and bioavailable Schlegel Hardy, 2002).Testosterone levels in men decline with age, butcan show variability from small decreases tomajor decreases depending on health status(Seidman, 2003). As testosterone levels declinein older males the amount of estrogen remainsstable, leading to a decline in the testosterone-to-estrogen ration (Kandeel et al., 2001). Adecline in testosterone is often associated withdecreases in libido, spontaneous erections, sex-ual desire, and sexual thoughts (Seidman, 2003). Male System Changes The Testes. In aging, the testes decrease in both size and weight, but with high variability amongmen (Digiovanna, 2000). The Leydig cells decreasein number but not in structure. In addition, thesecells decrease their production of testosterone(Digiovanna, 2000; Yialamas & Hayes, Incontrast, the small amount of estrogen secreted bythe testes does not decline with age nor does theestrogen that is aromatized from androstenedione.As a result, the ratio of estrogen to testosteroneincreases in older males (Partin & Rodriguez,2002). In stages over time, the seminiferoustubules show thinning of the walls and narrowingof lumen. The lumen can become so narrow thatthe seminiferous tubules become blocked(Digiovanna, 2000). Other dynamics that maycontribute or enhance aging of the structure andfunction of the seminiferous tubules includedecreased blood flow and changes in testosteroneproduction (Digiovanna, 2000). Although adecline in sperm production occurs in aging males,the production never ceases. As a result, the oldermale remains fertile (Digiovanna, 2000). Glands. The seminal vesicles and the bul- bourethral glands demonstrate no age-relatedchanges (Digiovanna, 2000). However, thebiggest concern in older males is changes in theprostate gland. The lining and muscle layer of28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 179 180 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems the prostate gland become thinner with age,probably due to the reduced blood flow to thearea (Digiovanna, 2000). Benign prostatichyperplasia (BPH), which is dependent on ageand androgen production, remains very com-mon in aging males with approximately 50%of men experiencing nodules by age 60 andaround 90% by age 85 (Hollander & Diokno,1998; Letran & Brawer, 1999). By age 60,approximately 13% of males will be diagnosedwith clinical BPH that requires medical atten-tion. By age 85, this percentage has increasedto 23% (Letran & Brawer, 1999). BPH causesthe prostate large, which mayresult in blockages (Hafez & Hafez,2004; include increased fre-quency and discomfort with urination, bladderand kidney and Paick et al., 2005;Rosen et al., 2003). The Penis. The penis begins to show fibrous changes in erectile tissue around the urethrastarting in the 30s and 40s. By ages 55 to 60years, increased fibrosis occurs in all erectile tis-sues (Digiovanna, 2000). This fibrosis in erectiletissue causes an increase in the amount of time ittakes to achieve an erection in the older male;however, the ability to have an erection is main-tained with age and is usually most affected bymedication or disease (Digiovanna, 2000; Kandeelet al., 2001). In addition to the increase in timeto obtain an erection, older males also requiremore stimulation in order to maintain the erec-tion. In addition, older males generally experi-ence less intense orgasms and ejaculation,decreases in ejaculatory volume, and an increasein the refractory period following ejaculation(Kandeel et al., 2001; Schlegel & Hardy, 2002). AndropauseAndropause is classified as a decline in testos- terone levels and eventual deficiency significantenough to cause clinical symptoms (ASRMPractice Committee, 2004; Hafez & Hafez, 2004;Yialamas & Hayes, 2003). Unlike menopause,andropause occurs gradually over time and doesnot occur in all aging males (Hafez & Hafez,2004). A decline in the functional ability of theentire reproductive axis causes decreased produc-tion of testosterone in aging males (Yialamas &Hayes, 2003). When testosterone is produced inthe adult stimulates negative feedback ofGnRH, FSH, and LH secretion. In the olderadult male this negative feedback is enhanced(Yialamas & Hayes, 2003). During andropause,when testosterone becomes extremely low, arecovery mechanism triggers increases in FSHand LH in an attempt elevate testosterone lev-els (Hafez & Hafez, 2004). Androgen deficiencyin the aging (ADAM) includes symptomsof low libido; decreased energy, strength, andstamina; increased enlargement, decreased musclemass, shrinkage testes, and increased fat (ASRM occurs via measurement oftotal serum testosterone levels. However, mea-sures of the true should bebased on total testosterone and testosterone28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 180 The Nervous System 181 metabolites as well as androgen receptor activity(Yialamas & Hayes, 2003). Although the hypothalamus-pituitary- gonadal axis controls both male and femalereproductive systems, the age-related changes inthe axis and the physiological effects are verydiverse. All males and females experience age-related changes in the reproductive system;however, these changes occur with tremendousvariability among individuals. The Nervous System Introduction to the NervousSystem The two components of the nervous system,central and peripheral, have the potential toaffect the entire body through continualcommunication via nerve innervations and sig-nals. As a person ages, natural changes occur inthe nervous systems that can have direct or indi-rect effects on the rest of the body. The centralnervous system consists of the brain and thespinal cord whereas the peripheral nervous sys-tem encompasses the motor and sensory neuronslocated in the sensory-somatic system and theautonomic system ( Figure 6-11 ). The auto- nomic nervous system consists of the motor andsensory neurons that maintain homeostasiswithin the body. It can be further divided intothe parasympathetic and sympathetic systems.Communication among the brain, spinal cord,and peripheral nerves serves as the sourceresponsible for maintenance of homeostasis.This communication process within the nervoussystem and between organ systems and the ner-vous system is demonstrated in Figure 6-12. The process of aging in the nervous system could lead to profound effects on other organsystems when considering the constant com- munication that occurs. Any change in the ner-vous system has the potential to influence thestability of the entire body, even if minimally.In this section, the age-related changes thatoccur in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheralnerves will be discussed. The Aging Brain The human brain goes through many develop-mental changes throughout a person's lifespan.Aging should still be considered on a develop-mental scale, not a decrement scale. AlthoughBox 6-1 Research Highlight Aim/method: The authors conducted two studies for the purpose of examining thehypothesis that cardiovascular fitness canoffset declines in cognitive function. Findings: Study findings showed that increases in cardiovascular fitnessresulted in increased functioning of thebrain's attentional network during a cog-nitive challenge. Highly fit individualsexhibited greater brain activity than dideither low- or unfit individuals. Conclusion: The study results suggest that improvements in cardiovascularfitness can have a positive influence onthe plasticity of the aging brain. Source: Colcombe, S. J., Kramer, A.

Memory changes canbe observed by the fifth decade, but changesremain variable among individuals. There is alsogreat variation in the type of memory affected(Erickson & Barnes, 2003).Overall Structural ChangesThe brain decreases in size and weight as men andwomen age (Arking, 1998; Digiovanna, 1994;Minaker, 2004). At birth, the brain weighs ap-proximately 357 grams. Brain weight peaks atabout 1,300 grams around the age of 20 years.This weight is maintained until 55 years of age(Arking, 1998). After age 55 there is a decline inbrain weight. This decline can result in a brainweight that is 11% smaller than that observed inthe young adult brain (Arking, 1998). However,measurements of brain weight may show bias dueto individual differences in head size and bodyweight. Measuring changes in individual brainvolume helps to diffuse this inherent bias. Brainvolume appears to be stable from age 20 to 60 fol-lowed by a significant decline of between 5% and10% (Arking, 1998; Minaker, 2004). Magneticresonance imaging (MRI) studies demon-strated that, compared to women, men demon-strate greater age-related volume loss in the brainas a whole as well as in the temporal and 1992).In the same MRI study, researchers showed thatwomen had a greater loss of volume in the hip-pocampus and parietal lobes than that observed inmen. From ages 30 to 90 years both men andwomen experience a volume loss of 14% in thecerebral cortex, 35% in the hippocampus, and26% in cerebral white matter (Anderton,2002). Ventricles within the brain enlargethroughout the aging process. Ventricle size at age90 may be as much as three to four times ventri-cle size at age 20. Ventricle enlargement may helpto explain some loss n.d.; Digiovanna, 1994; Arking, 1998).While brainenlarge, the gyri\u2014raised ridges on the surface ofFigure 6-11 The central system nervous system and the peripheral nervous system have a constant feedback loop between each system as well as the external and internal environments.

The gray matter is located on the surfaceof the brain, known as the cerebral cortex, andcontains the nerve cell bodies. The white matter contains no cell bodies or dendrites, but is strictlymyelinated nerve fibers (Arking, 1998). Figure 6-13 demonstrates the composition of a nerve cell and fibers. The average number of neocorticalFigure 6-12 The autonomic nervous system serves to maintain homeostasis within the body by constant sensory and motor feedback with the central nervous system.

A study byPakkenberg and Gundersen (1997) that focusedon neuron numbers in 20- to 90-year-old indi-viduals showed that approximately 10% of allneocortical neurons are lost over the life span inboth sexes. Cell loss remains minimal in someparts of the brain whereas other areas showtremendous neuron decrease (Katzman, 1995).According to Beers & Berkow (n.d.), neuronalcell loss remains minimal in the brain stemnuclei, paraventricular nuclei, and supraopticnuclei. Losses in other areas can be great: 10% to60% the to the tempo-ral lobe. However, recent anatomical studies havenot shown any statistically significant age-relatedchange in neuron numbers in the hippocampus,the primary center for learning and memory(Erickson & Barnes, 2003). Unlike previous stud-ies, these recent anatomical studies have takeninto account age-related tissue shrinkage andhave utilized better-controlled stereologicalmethods in making the determination that noneuronal decreases occur (Anderton, 2002;Peters, 2002). Other sources describe a significantdecline of neurons in the cerebrum, which con-trols voluntary movement, vision, hearing, andother senses. Only a minimal neuronal loss is seenin the cerebellar cortex and the basal ganglia,which are responsible for muscle movement andcontrol (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). The brainstemdemonstrates some loss of neurons nucleusof Meynert (acetylcholine production) and thelocus coeruleus (norepinephrine production),which aids in sleep regulation (Digiovanna,1994, 2000). Early reports of neuron loss should be care- fully considered due to the fact that more recentstudies have used more carefully controlledhuman tissue samples, study design, and neuroncounting techniques (Peters, 2002). A loss ofneurons in the aging brain is present, but not tothe extent that researchers have reported in thepast (Morrison & Hof, 1997; Peters, 2002;Peters, Morrison, Rosene, & Hyman, 1998).The myelin sheath, which surrounds the axonon every neuron and promotes faster electricalsignaling along each neuron, breaks down inaging (Bartzokis et al., Dickson, 1997;Figure 6-13 A D. Chiras, Human biology (5th ed.). Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005. Muscle fibers Terminal boutonsCell body Nucleus Direction of conduction DendritesAxonAxon collateral28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 184 The Nervous System 185 Peters, 2002). Myelination of the axon appearsto continue until middle age, followed by abreakdown in the structural integrity of themyelin (Bartzokis et al., 2004; Dickson, 1997).This degradation of myelin may cause neuronaldisruption by slowing the nerve impulses asthey travel through the nervous system. Thismay help to explain mild age-related declines incognition and motor control (Dickson, 1997). The loss of a neuron or a decrease in neuron participation causes disruption of neural circuitsand hence neural signaling. Dendrites serve as thesystem through which nerve impulses are relayedto the neuron. The synapse serves as the mes- senger system between dendrites. Figure 6-14 demonstrates how a synapse works to relay chem-ical messages between neurons. The number ofdendrites and dendritic spines decreases with age,but not uniformly in the brain (Arking, 1998).Several human studies focusing on synapsechange in different areas of the brain throughoutthe lifespan have shown no significant change(Scheff, Price, & Sparks. 2001). However, signif-icant synapse loss has been shown in multiple Figure 6-14 A synapse and synaptic transmission. Source: Daniel D. Chiras, Human biology (5th ed.). Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005. Direction of conduction impulsePresynaptic neuron Vesicles membrane bound to neurotransmitter28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 185 186 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems brain areas in postmortem Alzheimer's diseasetissue when control tissue 1992;Scheff & Price, 1998, &Price, 1996). The brain demonstrates remarkable compen- satory mechanisms to recover from loss, even inold age. Plasticity, or the ability to lengthen and/or form new neuronal connections ontoavailable existing neurons, is one of these com-pensatory mechanisms (Beers & Berkow, n.d.;Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). Plasticity An example of synaptic alter-ation is synapses' ability to broaden and cover more surface area, possibly compensating forsynapse loss in some brain areas (Digiovanna,1994, 2000; Terry, DeTeresa, & Hansen, 1987).In aging or injury, new neuronal connectionsspecifically compensate for the loss of neurons incertain brain areas in order to aid in preservationof function (Beers & Berkow, n.d.). Plasticitydoes diminish with age, but is not completelylost. Aging effects include a decrease in long-term potentiation and synaptogenesis in addi-tion to delays in axon sprouting that in turnaffect the formation of new connections (Tete &Ashford, 2002). Neurotransmitter ChangesA neurotransmitter is a travelsdown the axon through the into space and onto corresponding receptorson the postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitterchanges during the aging process can influencememory and cognition as well as behavior andmotor , which release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, playa significant role in and memory (Arking, 1998; Mattson,1999). Acetylcholine induces cholinergic input to the hippocam-pus and neocortex in the brain (Kelly & Roth,1997; Mattson, 1999). With age, acetylcholinesynthesis and release from synaptic vesiclesbegin to decline. The postsynaptic acetylcholinereceptors, known as muscarinicreceptors, and transport also demon-strate (Beers Berkow, n.d.;Kelly 1999). In Alz-heimer's disease these cholinergic deficits aremore which led to the develop-ment of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor medica-tions now on the market to treat the disease.The objective of the medication is to decreasethe degradation of acetylcholine in the synap-tic space, thereby increasing the amount ofacetylcholine available to bind with postsynap-tic receptors. Dopaminergic. The dopaminergic system involves the substantia nigra and striatum (Arking,1998). In aging, dopamine levels decrease anddopamine transport in the neuron also dimin-ishes (Katzman, 1995; Mattson, 1999). Age-related changes are also found in dopaminereceptors. In addition, the ability of dopamineto bind to postsynaptic receptors also decreases(Katzman, 1995; Mattson, 1999). Positronemission tomography (PET) studies have showna decline in dopamine receptors located in thecaudate and putamen of the aging brain (Mozaz& Monguio, 2001). In Parkinson's disease,dopamine levels are greatly decreased, leadingto the hallmark symptom of diminished motorcontrol. Decreases in dopamine with age mayexplain some age-related motor deficits as well28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 186 The Nervous System 187 as motor dysfunction resulting from the use ofmedications targeting the dopaminergic neuro-transmitter system (Kelly & Roth, et al., 1998). tem consists mainly of the neurotransmitters and located in 1997; Norepinephrinetends to increase with age in certain brainregions, but corresponding receptors have beenshown to decrease in both humans and animals(Gruenewald & Matsumoto, 1999; Mattson,1999). Serotonin levels and receptor bindingsites both decrease with age, which may play arole in depression and sleep changes later in life(Mattson, 1999; Ramos-Platon & Beneto-Pascual, 2001). Amino Acid Transmitters. The amino acid neurotransmitters consist mainly of gluta- mate, central location for learning and memory, con-tains high levels of glutamate. This relationshipbetween glutamate and memory leads to a ques-tioning of the idea that memory decline isstrongly tied solely to acetylcholine depletion(Kelly & Roth, 1997). Glutamate receptorsdecline with age, but the change in glutamatewith age is unknown (Mattson, 1999). Theoverstimulation and release of glutamate may besignificant in disease, and well asstroke (Mattson, GABA areas of the nigra and theglobus pallidus (Kelly & Roth, 1997). Age-related neurotransmitterare unknown; enzyme glutamicacid decarboxylase (Gluck, Thomas, Davis, &Haroutunian, 2002). So, changes in glutamatecould have a direct or indirect effect on GABAin the aging brain and vice versa.Neuroendocrine ChangesAge-related changes to neuroendocrine func-tioning affect many other systems in the body.Figure 6-15 demonstrates body systems that are controlled and/or affected by changes in neu-roendocrine functioning with an emphasis onthe pituitary gland. Aging changes in secretionof hypothalamic-releasing hormone are studiedindirectly by observing changes in pituitarysecretion response to hypothalamic-releasinghormone, to chemicals that block feedbackmechanisms, and to chemicals that stimulatethe release of hypothalamic-pituitary hormone(Gruenewald & Matsumoto, 1999). One exam-ple of a neuroendocrine age-related change is thereproductive axis or the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that controls the regulation of maleand female hormones (Chakraborty & Gore,2004; Hall, 2004). (Refer to \"The ReproductiveSystem\" earlier in this chapter for further dis-cussion of adaptability (Ferrari et al., 2001). TheHPA axis regulates glucocorticoid levels in thebody and allows the body to respond to stress-ful conditions (Ferrari et al., 2001; Gruenewald& Matsumoto, 1999). Age changes in the neg-ative feedback system of glucocorticoids on the28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 187 188 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Figure 6-15 The pituitary gland.

Consequently,damage may occur to hippocampal neuronsneeded for cognitive function (Gruenewald &Matsumoto, 1999). In the central nervous system, the neurotrans- mitters dopamine and norepinephrine affect hypo-thalamic and pituitary hormone withage the stimulates dopaminergic neurons in thehypothalamus, but with age dopaminergicchanges lead to deregulation of prolactionsecretion (Gruenewald & Matsumoto, 1999).Norepinephrine levels have been shown toincrease in certain brain areas even with a decreasein noradrenergic neurons and receptors (Mattson,1999). An age-related increase in norepinephrinecould affect the release of growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and leu-tinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland(Gruenewald & Matsumoto, 1999). Neuro-endocrine changes with age have the potential toaffect many systems in the body via hormonealterations. These changes are an example of howthe nervous system plays an integral role in everyaspect of the human body. V ascular ChangesCerebral blood flow decreases with age, report-edly by an average of 20%. Decreased bloodflow is accompanied by decreased glucose uti-lization and metabolic rate of oxygen n.d.;Dickson, toKatzman (1995), the National Institute ofMental Health longitudinal study revealed thatindividuals with an average age of 70 years werecomparable in cerebral blood flow to individu-als with an average age of 20.8 years. However,an 11-year follow-up showed that the older cog-nitively intact participants had a significantreduction in cerebral blood flow, leading to theconclusion that the eighth decade of life was aturning point. The rate of blood flow in womendecreases slightly more rapidly than in men;however, blood flow is usually greater in womenthan in men until age 60 (Beers & Berkow,n.d.). Potential explanations for decreased cere-bral blood flow include cerebrovascular disease,structural changes in cerebral blood vessels, andneuron loss accompanied by a reduction inblood flow need (de la Torre, 1997). Cerebralblood vessels display less elasticity and increasedfibrosis, which may lead to increased vascularresistance (Mattson, 1999). The blood-brain barrier shows age-related degradation of capillary walls. This degradationaffects the ability of nutrients such as glucose andoxygen to nourish the brain (Arking, 1998; de laTorre, 1997; Mattson, 1999). In conjunctionwith the inability to effectively nourish the brain,changes in capillaries could also prevent waste by-products from effectively exiting the blood-brainbarrier and in turn causing a build-up of poten-tially neurotoxic substances (de la Torre, 1997). Plaques and Tangles/H9252-amyloid hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease(Figure 6-16 ), but both can be found in older individuals without evidence of dementia(Anderton, 2002; Beers & Berkow, n.d.; Dickson,1997; Schmitt et al., 2000). Plaques occur out-side of the neuronal cell and consist of grey mat-ter with a protein core surrounded by abnormalneurites (Anderton, 2002). Each plaque consistsof a core of protein with the dominant protein28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 189 190 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Figure 6-16 The difference between control and Alzheimer's disease tissue in relation to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaques and tangles can be present in control tissue with no signs of memory problems.

Neurofibrillary tangles occur in the neuronal cell body and consist of paired helical filamentsand a few straight filaments (Anderton, 2002;Dickson, 1997). The main protein associatedwith neurofibrillary tangles is known as tau, aphosphoprotein that phosphorylation and increases in den-28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 190 The Nervous System 191 sity (Dickson, 1997). In aging, tangles are foundin very low numbers and usually greatestdensity of tangles appears in the entorhinal cor-tex, whereas in the Alzheimer's disease brainplaques spread throughout the entire cortex(Dickson, 1997).Free RadicalsA free radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron in the outer shell of electrons. A free rad-ical remains unstable until paired with anothermolecule (Mattson, 1999). In humans, oxygen isthe major molecule in the generation of free radi-cals. Although the brain makes up only 2% of to-tal body weight, it consumes around 20% of thetotal oxygen uptake (Benzi & Moretti, 1997). Inthe cell, mitochondria continuously emit oxygenfree radicals during the electron transport process,which manifests oxidative 2002).Antioxidants and repair mechanisms for oxida-tive stress in biological systems are covered underthe oxidative stress hypothesis (see Chapter 2).Oxygen free radicals, or oxyradicals, continuallyincrease and accumulate with age, causing oxida-tive damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA inhuman tissue including the brain (Mattson,1999; Sohal et al., 2002). Oxidative damage toproteins, such as cell membrane proteins, couldbe highly significant in brain aging. Such dam-age can result in loss of structural integrity andsubsequent cell dysfunction and neuron degener-ation (Mattson, 1999; Sohal et al., 2002). NuclearDNA in the nervous system does not incur muchoxidative damage in aging; however, oxidativedamage is tremendous in mitochondrial DNAbecause mitochondria are the main source of freeradical production (Mattson, 1999). A decreasein available cell energy and impairment in cellmetabolism could be mechanisms in promotingfree radical production with age (Mattson, 1999;Sohal et al., 2002). The Aging Spinal Cord CellsOverall, the number of spinal cord cells remainsstable until around age 60 and then declinesthereafter (Beers & Berkow, n.d.; Digiovanna,1994). Interneuron loss in the lower spinal cordhas been reported. Neuron decrements of up to25% to 45% are observed in those neurons ofthe spinal layer that correlate to the cerebral cor-tex (Arking, 1998). Nerve ConductionAccording to Abrams and colleagues (1995), theaging spine may narrow due to pressure on thespinal cord resulting from bone overgrowth.Due to this narrowing, spinal cord axonsdecrease and can eventually cause changes insensation. However, these effects may be corre-lated not only with age, but also with degener-ative disease processes or compression of spinaldisks that clamp nerves (Beers & Berkow, n.d.).An MRI study by Ishikawa and colleagues(2003) focused on age-associated changes of thecervical spinal cord and spinal canal. Theseresearchers concluded that the transverse area ofthe cervical spinal cord decreased with age andthe spinal canal narrowed with age. These agingchanges may directly or indirectly affect motorcontrol and/or sensory systems in the body. The Aging Peripheral Nervous System The peripheral nervous system contains approx-imately 100 billion nerve cells . These cells form28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 191 192 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems nerve fibers that cascade throughout the body,connecting the central nervous system to the restof the body. Hence, these cells work as a relaymessenger system (Abrams, Beers, & Berkow,1995). The somatic nervous system connects thebrain and spinal cord to skeletal muscles and sen-sory receptors. The autonomic nervous systemregulates organ function through activation ofnervous system response and through inhibitionof parasympathetic response (Abrams et al.,1995). See Figure 6-12 for a diagram of the auto-nomic pathway of the peripheral nervous system.Nerve conduction speed slows with age as aresult of the degradation of the myelin sheathsthat Peters,2002). Changes in motor speed, such as reactiontimes to stimuli, and changes in sensory abilities,such as changes in taste or smell, may beexplained by these age-related changes in theperipheral nervous system. Sensory NeuronsSensory neuron function declines with age, lead-ing to alterations in reflexes and voluntaryactions and influencing certain quality of lifeareas such as memories, thoughts, and emotion(Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). The sense of touchchanges with age due to changes in the touchreceptors, or Meissner's corpuscles, and the pres-sure receptors, or Pacinian corpuscles. However,only small changes in sensory neurons related totouch are observed (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000).Sensory neurons for smell, or olfactory neurons,decrease with age, causing a lessened ability todetect and identify certain smells. This damp-ened ability could affect eating habits and, dueto the inability to detect toxic fumes, may alsoplace older adults in potentially dangerous situ-ations (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). The sense oftaste involves the flavors of salty, sweet, sour, andbitter. Aging changes occur on an individualbasis, usually affecting salty and bitter flavors,with salty flavors declining the most (Digio-vanna, 1994, 2000). However, the sense of smellmay also play a significant role in the age-relatedchanges in taste. This may occur because of thestrong link between certain food aromas andtaste expectations. The sense of taste has a rapidcompensatory response to injury, such as burn-ing the tongue with hot food, and even aging.This compensatory response is characterized byreplacement of taste receptors and sensory neu-rons (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). Other sensoryneurons that decline with age affect the moni-toring of blood pressure, thirst, urine in thebladder, and fecal matter in the intestine and rec-tum. Bone, joint, and muscle position and func-tion are also affected by age-related changes insensory neurons (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000).Somatic Motor NeuronsWith age, there is a decrease in the number ofmotor neurons. As a result, there is a reductionin the number of muscle cells and consequentmuscle degeneration and weakness (Digiovanna,1994, 2000). Age changes in the remainingmotor neurons include myelin breakdown andcell membrane damage. These changes lead toslower relay of messages that in turn alters theability of the muscle to contract and relax(Bartzokis et al., 2004; Digiovanna, 1994,2000). Changes in both sensory and motorperipheral nerve pathways cause voluntarymovements to become slower, less accurate, andless coordinated with age (Digiovanna, 1994).These aging changes that affect muscle strengthand movement abilities can be lessened withdaily exercise aimed at increasing and retainingthe performance of remaining muscle.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 192 The Nervous System 193 Autonomic Motor NeuronsAging causes changes to both the sympatheticand parasympathetic pathways to organ systems.One example of these changes is seen in thebody's response to change in blood pressure.When blood pressure drops too low, sympatheticneurons usually help to increase blood pressure bystimulating the heart and constricting blood ves-sels. However, with age the sympathetic responseis delayed, causing low blood pressure and sub-sequent orthostatic hypotension. When bloodpressure rises, the parasympathetic pathway helpsto slow the heart rate. But with age this functiondeclines, resulting in elevated blood pressure aswell as a decrease in the time required to returnto homeostasis (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000).Autonomic neuron age-related changes sympathetic path-way normally acts to constrict blood vessels,thereby preventing heat loss in cold conditions.However, with age there is a decline in this actionand this decline, together with age-relatedchanges in blood vessels, results in increased riskof hypothermia (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). Otherage-related changes in the autonomic pathwaythat affect vision, swallowing, and sexual arousalwill be covered in other sections of this chapter.Injury ResponsivenessThroughout life, peripheral nerve injury is usu-ally repaired through new axon growth andnerve reinnervation of the damaged area, but agedecreases these reparative properties (Beers &Berkow, n.d.). These changes in the peripheralnervous system cause older individuals tobecome slower in detecting and recognizingstimuli, thereby making actions and reactionsmore difficult (Digiovanna, 1994). The nervous system remains the most inte- gral organ system in the body due to its influ-ence on every other organ system. Age-relatedchanges that occur at the central and peripheralnerve levels can directly and indirectly influencethe homeostasis of the entire body. Whenobserving an age-related change in the olderadult, professionals need to broaden their scopeof observation to integrate other body systemsso that they may better understand the agingchanges in the person as a whole. The Endocrine System The endocrine system consists of various glands,groups of cells that produce and secrete chemi-cal messengers known as hormones . Hormones transfer information from one set of cells toanother as they work to maintain overall home-ostasis and regulate the body's growth, metabo-lism, and sexual development and function. Themajor testes). Thepancreas together with its hormones is also con-sidered part of the endocrine system. Age-related changes to the endocrine system as awhole are best presented through individual dis-cussion of the glands, their hormones, and thefunctions they perform. The Hypothalamus andPituitary Gland The hypothalamus is a collection of cells locatedin the lower, central portion of the brain, and itprovides a link between the nervous system andendocrine systems. Nerves within the hypothal-amus produce hypophysiotropic hormones that either stimulate or suppress the secretion ofhormones from the pituitary gland. Thus, thehypothalamus acts mechanism ofcontrol for pituitary hormone secretion. The28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 193 194 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems hypothalamus provides hormonal messages tothe pituitary, which in turn produces andsecretes its own hormones. The pituitary gland, only the size of a pea, is located just below the hypothalamus at the baseof the brain. It is often termed the \"mastergland\" because it produces hormones that regu-late numerous other endocrine glands. Theseregulatory hormones include growth hormone,vasopressin, thyrotropin, and corticotropin.Growth hormone and vasopressin will be dis-cussed here, and thyrotropin and corticotropinwill be discussed with the thyroid and adrenalglands, respectively.Growth HormoneGrowth hormone (GH) is released from the pituitary gland in response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH) secreted by the hypo-thalamus. GH stimulates the uptake of aminoacids into cells and the synthesis of proteinsfrom these amino acids. In so doing, GH pro-motes the growth of bone, muscle, and otherbody tissues. Growth hormone also plays a rolein the body's handling of nutrients because itcauses increased breakdown of fat for energy. Inaddition, GH is known to act antagonisticallyto insulin and increase blood sugar levels (seethe discussion of the pancreas and its functionlater in this chapter). There is some evidence to suggest that with advancing age there is a decline in the level ofGH. The reason for this observed decline has notbeen well defined, but may involve changes inthe diurnal rhythm of GH secretion. In youngadults, GH secretion and blood levels of GH riseduring the night, reaching a nocturnal peak dur-ing the first 4 hours of sleep (P . S. Timiras,2003a), and taper off toward morning, with GHlevels reaching a minimum during the day.Results from studies examining age-relatedchanges in GH show an overall decrease innightly GH secretion as well as a dampening ofthe hormone's peak (Prinz, Weitzman,Cunningham, & Karacan, 1983). It is thoughtthat over time the nightly increase in GH secre-tion may cease completely and become constantat all times (Digiovanna, 1994). Whatever themechanisms behind it, the age-related decline inGH is of great importance because it contributesto age-associated loss of muscle mass anddecreased bone formation (P secreted by neurons that the hypothalamus and extend into thepituitary gland. Vasopressin works to regulatehomeostatic levels of osmotic pressure andblood pressure. The release of vasopressin isstimulated by either a decrease in blood pres-sure or an increase in osmotic pressure. Oncesecreted, vasopressin promotes water reabsorp-tion by the kidneys. This reabsorption of waterprevents increases in the body's osmotic pres-sure and helps to maintain a substantial bloodvolume, thereby preventing blood pressurefrom becoming too low. Vasopressin secretionalso helps to maintain blood pressure by stim-ulating the constriction of blood vessels. Therelease of vasopressin is inhibited by increasedblood pressure or decreased osmotic pressure aswell as by alcohol. Decreased levels of vaso-pressin result in the loss of water through theurine. This fluid loss leads to increases inosmotic pressure as well as decreases in bloodvolume and blood pressure. With age there is an average increase in lev- els of circulating vasopressin. However, this age-related increase does not produce a subsequent28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 194 The Nervous System 195 rise in water reabsorption as would be expected(P . S. Timiras, 2003a). The reason for this isunclear, but most research suggests that the fail-ure to respond to increased vasopressin levelswith increased water reabsorption occurs pri-marily in individuals with kidney infections orhypertension and, thus, should not be viewed asa usual characteristic of the aging process (P . S.Timiras, 2003a). In general, age-related changesin vasopressin levels are known to have sig-nificant effects on body homeostasis. Further-more, the ability of vasopressin to respondappropriately to low blood pressure remainsunchanged with age. The Thyroid Gland T4 and T3The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the lower front portion of the neck.The secretion of the thyroid hormones, thyrox- ine (T4) and (T3) , occurs hypothalamus producesand T3. negative feedback loop, T4 and T3 inhibitTSH secretion. Thus, with higher levels of T4and T3, levels of TSH are lower and vice versa. Inaddition to its role of regulating the T4 and T3levels, TSH acts to maintain the growth andstructural integrity of the thyroid gland. Anabsence or deficit of TSH results in atrophy of thethyroid (P . S. Timiras, 2003c). During the early years of life, the thyroid gland is essential for growth of the whole body and itsorgans as well as development and maturation ofthe central nervous system. In adulthood, how-ever, the thyroid functions mainly to regulate thebody's metabolic rate. T4 and T3 both promotean increase in metabolic rate. Heat is a byproductof the metabolic process and, hence, increasedmetabolic rate leads to an increase in heat pro-duction. Thus, the thyroid hormones also act toregulate body temperature. The thyroid gland isnot essential for life (P . S. Timiras, 2003c); how-ever, without this gland there is a slowing of themetabolic rate, general lethargy, and a poor resis-tance to cold. In contrast, abnormally high levelsof the thyroid hormones result in a potentiallydangerous elevation of metabolic rate. As the body ages, thyroid hormone levels decrease slightly yet remain in the lower rangeof normal. In contrast, TSH levels are generallyin the high normal range. Borderline abnormalvalues of T4, T3, and TSH are more men (P . S. Timiras, 2003c). How-ever, there is a large degree of variability in thesehormone levels among older adults, and hor-mone levels may depend on age and generalhealth as well as gender. Yet, in general, theability of the thyroid and its hormones to pro-vide metabolic and thermal regulation is notimpaired with age. CalcitoninMost thyroid cells produce T4 and cells\u2014produce a hormonecalled calcitonin . Calcitonin promotes a decrease in blood calcium by stimulatingincreased uptake of calcium by bone-formingcells. Conversely, calcitonin inhibits the actionof cells involved in the of bone.Unlike secretion of T4 and T3, calcitonin hypothalamus or pitu-itary. Instead calcitonin release is regulated byblood calcium levels. High levels of calcium28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 195 196 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems trigger the secretion of calcitonin. Calcitoninthen causes calcium to be removed from theblood, thereby lowering blood calcium levels.The lower calcium levels then feed back andinhibit calcitonin secretion. Little is known about age-related changes in calcitonin; however, there have been somereports of decreased calcitonin levels with age.Such a decrease would have profound effects onolder persons' risk of osteoporosis given theeffects of calcitonin formation andbreakdown. The Parathyroid Gland The parathyroid gland consists of groups of cells located on the back of the thyroid gland.The parathyroid gland secretes a hormoneknown as parathyroid PTH acts antagonistically to calcitonin, and home-ostasis of blood calcium depends heavily on aproper balance between PTH and calcitonin.PTH release is stimulated by low blood calciumlevels whereas elevated calcium levels inhibitPTH secretion. Thus, PTH works to raise bloodcalcium levels. It does this through a variety ofmechanisms including the removal of calciumfrom bone, the decline of calcium release intothe urine by the kidneys, and the activation ofvitamin D by the kidneys, which in turn stim-ulates calcium absorption by the small intestine. In children and young adults, calcium levels are maintained through the consumption andsubsequent intestinal absorption of dietary cal-cium. At these ages maintenance of blood cal-cium levels has no effect on bone (P . S. Timiras,2003c). However, in older persons calcium lev-els are maintained primarily through calciumreabsorption from bone. The reason for this shiftin mechanisms of calcium level regulation is notfully understood. However, it is thought thatwith age PTH may have a decreased ability tostimulate production of active vitamin D by thekidneys and/or that active vitamin D may beimpaired in its ability to stimulate intestinalabsorption of calcium. The Pineal Gland The pineal gland , a tiny gland located the secretes the hormone mela- tonin . Secretion of melatonin is highly influ- enced by light properties, including lightintensity, length of light exposure, and lightwavelength (i.e., color; Digiovanna, of increased light exposure detectionof decreased light exposure (night) stimulateshormone secretion. Hence, blood levels of mela-tonin follow a diurnal rhythm with hormonelevels highest at night and lowest during theday. It is melatonin that synchronizes internalbody functions with a day-night cycle thatshifts in response to seasonal changes in thelength of the day-night cycle (P . S. Timiras,2003c). Age is accompanied by a decline in melatonin levels. This decline can have a negative impacton other diurnal rhythms such as sleep patterns.Melatonin is known to reach peak concentrationsduring sleep, and administration of doses ofmelatonin equivalent to nighttime levels havebeen shown to promote and sustain sleep (P . S.Timiras, 2003c). Thus, age-related declines inmelatonin may be linked to the poor sleep qual-ity and insomnia of some elderly persons. The Adrenal Glands The adrenal glands are paired glands located above the kidneys. Each gland is composed of anouter region known as the adrenal cortex and an inner region known as the adrenal medulla . 28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM 197 The Adrenal CortexThe and sex hormones. Secretion glucocorti-coids and sex hormones from the adrenal stimulated ACTH diurnal rhythm and is itself stimulated bycorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. Thus, release of glucocorti-coids and sex hormones from the adrenal cortexrelies on eral metabolic These include increasedamino acid uptake and glucose production bythe liver, decreased amino acid uptake and pro-tein synthesis in muscle, inhibition of somatic(nonreproductive) cell growth, suppression ofgrowth hormone secretion from the pituitarygland, and mobilization of lipids and cholesterol.Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatoryactions including the inhibition of inflamma-tory and allergic reactions. The primary glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol . Cortisol is synthesized from choles- terol, and its follows the diurnalrhythm of ACTH release. Cortisol levels arehighest in the early morning hours and lowestin the evening. However, both ACTH and cor-tisol can be secreted independent of this diurnalrhythm under periods of physical or psycholog-ical stress (Aeron Biotechnology, 2005). Cortisolis, in fact, often referred to as the stress hormonebecause it promotes the production of increasedenergy necessary for dealing with stress. When cortisol is secreted it stimulates a breakdown of muscle protein, releasing aminoacids that can in turn be used by the liver to pro-duce glucose for energy. Cortisol also makes fattyacids, an energy source from fat cells, availablefor use. The net effect is an increase in energysupply that allows the brain to more effectivelycoordinate the body's response to a stressor. Theincreased energy supply also helps the muscles torespond quickly and efficiently to a stressor orthreat that requires a physical response. Early research suggested that cortisol secre- tion decreases slightly with advancing age, butthat this decreased secretion is compensated forby a simultaneous decrease in cortisol excretionfrom the body. As a result, normal cortisol lev-els would be maintained as a person ages. Morerecent studies, however, suggest that as long asindividuals are healthy, cortisol secretionremains unchanged with age (P . S. Timiras,2003a, 2003c). Studies conducted in animals have provided evidence that under stressful conditions corti-costerone (equivalent to the human cortisol) ismore elevated among old than young animals. Inaddition, this elevated level persists for a longerperiod of time in some older animals. It has beenhypothesized that the high levels of cortico-sterone following a stressor represent a loss ofresiliency of the HPA axis such that the axis failsto decrease ACTH in response to elevated corti-costerone levels and, consequently, fails to stopcorticosterone release once the stress has passed.In rats, there is evidence that the elevated levelsof corticosterone may be toxic to the brain, par-ticularly the hippocampus. To date there is littleevidence to support an age-related decline in thecompetence of the HPA axis among humans.However, given the age-associated changesfound in animal models, further study of thechanges in the HPA axis among older humans iswarranted (P . S. Timiras, 2003a). Clearly, glucocorticoids stimulate a beneficial response during times of stress. However,28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 197 198 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems glucocorticoids also have some undesirableeffects including suppression of cartilage andbone formation, stimulation of bone demineral-ization, inhibition of portions of the immuneresponse, and promotion of tractbleeding and ulcer formation (Digiovanna,1994). When glucocorticoids are administeredtherapeutically for their anti-inflammatoryeffects, their concentration in the blood can riseto extremely high levels. Excessively high levelsof glucocorticoids exacerbate their aforemen-tioned negative physiological effects. Given thatolder persons are generally at greater risk forosteoporosis and infection as well as high bloodpressure, therapeutic administration of gluco-corticoids in this population should be carefullymonitored. Mineralocorticoids. The mineralocorticoids derive their name from their critical role in reg-ulating extracellular concentrations of minerals,principally sodium and potassium. The primarymineralocorticoid is aldosterone , which targets the kidneys. Aldosterone has three major effects\u2014increased renal reabsorptionof sodium urinary secretion reabsorption of waterand consequent fluidvolume, and increased renal excretion of potas-sium. These physiological effects of aldosteroneaid in the maintenance of fluid-electrolyte bal-ance within the body. In addition aldosteronehelps to maintain blood pressure through itseffects on sodium and water retention and in-creased fluid (i.e., blood) volume (P . S. Timiras,2003a). Secretion of aldosterone is stimulated prima- rily through the release of the enzyme reninfrom the kidneys and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Renin isreleased in response to low blood pressure,increased osmotic pressure, and adverse changesin sodium concentrations. Once released, reninpromotes the production of angiotensin, a pep-tide that 2003a). Conversely, highblood pressure, decreased osmotic pressure, andfavorable changes in sodium concentrations willinhibit the release of renin and activation of therenin-angiotensin system. As a result, the pro-duction and release of aldosterone is suppressed(Digiovanna, 1994). The stimulation and suppression of aldo- sterone also have secondary regulatory mecha-nisms. The release of aldosterone is secondarilystimulated by pituitary ACTH. Suppression ofaldosterone release is secondarily controlled byhigh sodium concentrations, potassium defi-ciency, and the release of atrial natriuretic fac-tor, a hormone released by the heart in responseto increased blood volume (Digiovanna, 1994). Aldosterone levels decrease with age. The primary reason for this decrease is thought to bea decline in renin activity and subsequentdecline in the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The release of aldosterone inresponse to ACTH does not appear to undergoage-related CaliforniaAcademic Geriatric Resource Program, sodium reten-tion, decreased of aldosterone predisposeolder persons to sodium loss and possiblehyponatremia, a condition characterized bywater-mineral imbalance. In addition to the overall decrease in aldo- sterone levels, older persons have an impairedability to increase aldosterone secretion andaldosterone blood levels when necessary. Thus,there is a decline in aldosterone reserve capacity.This decline is not due to age-related changes inthe adrenal cortex; rather, it is thought to be the28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 198 The Nervous System 199 result of decreased ability of the kidneys tosecrete renin when needed (Digiovanna, 1994). Adrenal Sex Hormones. The primary adre- nal sex hormone of interest among aging per-sons is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) . DHEA is, in fact, the most abundant hormonein the human body (Shealy, 1995). The physio-logical function of DHEA is not well under-stood; however, it is known to convert to amultitude of other hormones, mainly the sexhormones testosterone and estrogen. The effectsof DHEA are largely the result of the actions ofthose hormones to which it is converted(Dhatariya & Nair, 2003). DHEA levels are high at birth but then undergo a precipitous drop until between the6th and 10th year of life, at which time DHEAlevels begin to steadily increase, achieving max-imal concentrations during the third decade(Arlt, 2004). By age 70-80 years DHEA levelsare only 5%-10% of peak values achieved adulthood (Hinson & Raven, 1999). Verylow levels of DHEA are also observed in a vari-ety of often age-related disease states includingdiabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's dis-ease, and various cancers. Thus, DHEA appearsto be one of the most critical hormones in pre-dicting disease. It has been hypothesized thatlow DHEA levels may be a marker of poorhealth status and, as a result, is associated withnot only increased risk of disease, but alsoincreased mortality (Arlt, 2004). As a result ofDHEA's association with aging and disease,DHEA replacement has been touted as a meansof slowing, if not reversing, the aging process aswell as the chronic disease and disability withwhich it is often accompanied. DHEA replacement studies in humans have produced equivocal results. For example,research has shown positive effects of DHEAreplacement on muscle strength and body com-position including increased muscle strengthand decreased fat mass. Positive effects on bone,including increased bone mineral density, havealso been demonstrated. However, numerousother studies have found no change in musclestrength, body composition, or bone densitywith DHEA replacement (Dhatariya & Nair,2003). Overall, there is no consensus regardingthe benefits of DHEA replacement. Althoughlow levels of DHEA may predispose an individ-ual to disease, there is no evidence that DHEAcauses disease. In addition, most studies ofDHEA replacement have been short term and,thus, there is a paucity of information regardingthe benefits (or risks) of DHEA use over longperiods of time (Hinson & Raven, 1999).DHEA is currently available without a pre-scription, but given the relative lack of infor-mation regarding the risks and benefits of itsuse, especially in the long term, caution shouldbe taken in self-administration of the hormonewithout medical supervision.Adrenal MedullaThe medulla norepinephrine (noradrenaline), are produced in the adrenalmedulla and released in response to sympatheticnervous system activity. Much like cortisol, epi-nephrine and norepinephrine play a critical rolein the body's stress response, and their release isgreatly increased under stressful conditions.Major physiological effects mediated by epi-nephrine and norepinephrine hormones includeincreased heart rate and blood pressure,increased metabolic rate, and increased bloodglucose levels and hence increased energy. There28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 199 200 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems is also an inhibition of nonessential activitiessuch as gastrointestinal secretion. This prepar-ing of the body to respond to stress or threat isoften termed the \"fight or flight\" response.Activation of adrenal medullary hormones isstimulated through a variety of means includ-ing low blood sugar, hemorrhage, threat of bod-ily harm, emotional distress, and even exercise. With aging there is a decrease in epinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla. One studyhas reported that, under resting conditions, epi-nephrine secretion is 40% less in older as com-pared to younger men. However, there is a 20%simultaneous age-related decrease in epineph-rine clearance from the circulation (Esler et al.,1995). As a result, levels of epinephrine con-centration do not change significantly with age(Seals & Esler, 2000). Mechanisms for the age-related decline in epinephrine secretion have notbeen well include attenuation in theadrenal medulla's response to nervous systemactivity, and 2) an overall age-associated decreasein nervous system activity to the adrenalmedulla. It has also been hypothesized thatreduced epinephrine secretion with age may bethe result of decreased synthesis and storage ofepinephrine in the adrenal medulla (Seals &Esler, 2000). Under stressful conditions there is a charac- teristic increase in epinephrine secretion. Thisincrease is markedly attenuated in older persons.Research has found that the increase in epineph-rine secretion in response to a stressor is reducedby 33%-44% in older men as compared to theiryounger counterparts (Seals & Esler, 2000).Thus, the ability of the adrenal medulla to effec-tively respond to stressful situations is greatlyimpaired, even in healthy older adults.Reproductive Hormones Please refer to the previous discussion of thereproductive system for a review of age-relatedchanges in the reproductive axis and female andmale reproductive hormones.The PancreasThe hormone-secreting cells of the pancreasoccur in tiny clusters known as the islets of Langerhans . Four islet cell types have been identified: the alpha (A), beta (B), delta (D),and pancreatic cells. Ofthese hormones, only insulin is secreted exclu-sively by its cell type (B cells). The other hor-mones are also secreted by the gastrointestinalmucosa, and somatostatin can be found in thebrain. The function of PP cells has not beenwell identified, and as such will not be dis-cussed here. Both insulin and glucagon are an integral part of metabolism regulation, and their secre-tion is regulated principally by blood glucoselevels. High blood glucose levels stimulate therelease of insulin and inhibit glucagon secre-tion. The released insulin then stimulates thecells of the body to absorb an amount of glucosefrom the blood that is sufficient to meet thebody's energy needs. It also acts to promotestorage of excess glucose in the liver, muscle,and fat cells and to suppress the release of thisstored glucose. The result is a lowering of bloodglucose levels. Conversely, low blood glucoselevels stimulate glucagon release and inhibitinsulin secretion. Secreted glucagon then pro-motes the release of stored glucose, and theresult is a rise in blood glucose level. Somato-statin can inhibit the release of both insulin and28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 200 The Nervous System 201 glucagon. Yet, the overall role of this hormonein regulation of blood glucose levels has notbeen firmly established.Blood Glucose LevelsBlood glucose level is generally expressed as theamount (in milligrams) of glucose per deciliter(100 ml) of blood. According to the guidelinesof the American Diabetes Association (ADA),normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level isbelow 100 mg/dl. When the FPG level liesbetween 100 and 125 mg/dl, an individual is saidto have impaired fasting glucose, or impairedglucose tolerance , meaning that he or she is unable to reverse a dramatic rise in blood glucoselevels and restore glucose homeostasis. An FPGof >126 mg/dl indicates a diagnosis of diabetes(American Diabetes Association, 2005). In addition to the FPG, a person's ability to respond to increased blood glucose levels canalso be measured by the oral glucose tolerancetest (OGTT). The OGTT involves drinking asolution of concentrated glucose after havingfasted for at least 10 hours. Blood glucose lev-els are measured at the beginning of the test andthen periodically thereafter for 3 hours.Individuals with normal glucose tolerance willexhibit a rise in glucose levels following con-sumption of the glucose solution, but glucoselevels will return to normal within 2 hours. Inpersons with impaired glucose tolerance, bloodglucose levels will remain high for longer than2 hours. According to ADA guidelines, a personwhose blood glucose level is 140 mg/dl or lessafter 2 hours is considered to have a normal glu-cose response. A person whose blood glucoselevel falls to between 140 and 199 mg/dl after2 hours is said to be glucose intolerant. When,after 2 hours, blood glucose levels are elevatedto 200 mg/dl or above a person has diabetes(American Diabetes Association, 2005)Age-Related Glucose IntoleranceFirst documented by Spence (1921) and sinceconfirmed by numerous others, biological agingis associated with a decline in glucose tolerance.This decline is generally associated withimpaired response to a glucose challenge such asthe OGTT rather than with fasting glucose lev-els. Although a small rise in fasting glucose of1-2 mg/dl per decade has been observed bysome, it is postprandial (following a meal) glu-cose levels that show the greatest increase, up to15 mg/dl per decade (Morrow & Halter, 1994).Thus, the glucose intolerance of aging is asso-ciated primarily with response to glucose chal-lenge or oral glucose load (Jackson, 1990).Approximately 40% of individuals aged 65 to74 years have some degree of impairment inglucose homeostasis. This percentage rises to50% in those over the age of 80 years (Harris,1990; Minaker, 1990). The altered glucosemetabolism that comes with increased age haspotentially important pathophysiological con-sequences, because these age-related changeshave been associated with an accumulation ofadvanced glycosylation end products (AGEs)that are believed to contribute to varying age-related pathologies as well as long-term com-plications in those who have diabetes (Halter,2000). Mechanisms proposed as contributing toage-related glucose intolerance include impairedinsulin secretion, insulin resistance, and alter-ations in glucose counterregulation. Insulin Secretion. Studies of the effects of aging on insulin secretion provide some evi-dence that aging may be associated with subtleimpairment in insulin release (Chen, Halter, &28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 201 202 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Porte). Other research, however, has found noalteration in insulin secretion with age (Peters& Davidson, 1997), and overall, results fromvarious studies have provided equivocal resultsregarding the role of insulin secretion in theimpaired glucose tolerance of aging. Althoughthe inability to secrete sufficient amounts ofinsulin to overcome the heightened blood glu-cose levels and insulin resistance associated withaging may contribute to the phenomenon,impaired insulin secretion is generally notregarded as the primary cause of age-related glu-cose intolerance. Insulin Resistance. A defect in insulin action is generally presented as the greatest con-tributing factor in impaired glucose toleranceamong elderly persons. Evidence suggests thatthe primary effect of the aging process on glu-cose homeostasis is the development of a resis-tance to the actions of insulin, that is, insulin resistance (Peters & Davidson, 1997). This resistance leads to an impaired ability to sup-press glucose release from the liver as well as animpaired glucose uptake, with the latter defectpredominating. Skeletal muscle is consideredthe primary site of the impaired glucose uptake(Jackson, 1990). The mechanism(s) throughwhich this impairment develops is still poorlyunderstood. However, because insulin receptorson cell membranes appear to be withage (Fink, Kolterman, & Olefsky, 1983;Rowe, Minaker, Pallotta, & Flier, 1983), theprincipal cause of resistance to insulin uptake isassumed to be a postreceptor defect. It ishypothesized this defect may involve the trans-portation of glucose from the membrane recep-tor into the cell. Glucose uptake in virtually allcells is mediated by transporter proteins.GLUT4 is an insulin-mediated transporterlocated within vesicles in the cells' cytoplasm.Upon stimulation by insulin, these vesiclestravel to the cell membrane and release theGLUT4 transporters, which in turn serve as aport of cell entry for glucose. In the absence ofinsulin stimulation, GLUT4 is transferred backto vesicles and the entry of glucose is slowed(Czech, Erwin, & Sleeman, 1996). Thus,GLUT4 plays a central role in the maintenanceof glucose homeostasis, and it is hypothesizedthat impaired GLUT4 synthesis, transfer, andactivity may lead to insulin resistance (Halter,2000). Glucose Counterregulation. Research has reported that glucose counterregulation byglucagon as well as other hormones\u2014such asepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone\u2014that tend to raise blood glucose levels isimpaired in healthy elderly individuals (Marker,Cryer, & Clutter, 1992; Meneilly, Cheung, &Tuokko, 1994b). Rather than contributing to anelevation of plasma glucose levels, such a defectin glucose counterregulation results in delayedrecovery from the hypoglycemic (low bloodsugar) state. Thus, the impaired glucose homeo-stasis characterizing aging is marked not onlyby elevated fasting plasma glucose but also byperiods of prolonged hypoglycemia. The lattergains even greater importance when it is recog-nized that in comparison to younger subjects,elders demonstrate reduced awareness of theautonomic warning signs of hypoglycemia(Meneilly, Cheung, & Tuokko, 1994a). Further-more, they exhibit impaired psychomotor per-formance during hypoglycemic episodes andthus are less likely to take the action necessaryto return glucose levels to normal even if theyare aware of the existing hypoglycemia (Meneilly,2001).28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 202 The Nervous System 203 Confounding Factors of the GlucoseIntolerance of AgingA general consensus exists that the processes ofbiological and physiological aging are them-selves the most important contributors toimpaired glucose homeostasis among elders(Meneilly, 2001). However, other factors existthat may contribute to the severity of theimpairment. These include genetic predisposi-tion (Halter, 2000) as well as various lifestyleand environmental factors. Adiposity. Aging is associated with a decrease in lean body mass (Peters &Davidson, 1997) and an overall increase inadiposity as well as a redistribution of adiposetissue to the intra-abdominal region (Kotz,Billington, & Leveine, 1999). This tissueredistribution places the elderly population atincreased risk for development of insulinresistance and glucose intolerance becauseclinical studies have shown that persons withthis adipose distribution pattern exhibitgreater insulin resistance as well as increasedrisk of diabetes (Despres & Marette, 1999;Garg, 1999). Research shows that adipose tis-sue in the abdominal region is metabolicallymore active than that in other regions of thebody due to elevated fatty acid concentrationsin this area (Bjorntorp, 1997; Garg, 1999). Itis hypothesized that this increased metabolicactivity may be the cause of the increasedinsulin resistance associated with overweightand obesity (Despres & Marette, 1999).Indeed, it has been shown that older peoplewho are classified as having normal glucosetolerance have less adiposity, particularly lessintra-abdominal or central adiposity, and theydo not experience a detectable difference insensitivity to insulin (Halter, 2000).Physical Activity. Physical activity is known to increase insulin action through heightenedinsulin sensitivity (Dela, Mikines, & Galbo,1999; Jackson, 1990). Thus, decreased levels ofphysical activity may contribute to the devel-opment of insulin resistance. Aging is generallyassociated with declines in functional mobilityand a decrease in physical activity, thereby plac-ing elders at greater risk for impaired glucosetolerance. Older individuals with greaterdegrees of physical activity exhibit better glu-cose tolerance and less evidence of insulin resis-tance than do less active older people (Halter,2000). It has been shown that glucose uptake ishigh in elderly athletes and low in bed-riddenelders compared with elderly controls (Dela etal., 1999). Furthermore, among elders endurancetraining has been shown to produce improve-ments in insulin-mediated glucose uptake sim-ilar to those observed in young subjects (Dela etal., 1999). It must be noted, however, that elderswho are more physically active are also morelikely to have less body fat and less central adi-posity (Halter, 2000). Thus, it is most likely thecombined effects of reduced abdominal adipos-ity and increased levels of physical activity thatgive rise to greater insulin sensitivity and glu-cose tolerance. Diet. There is some evidence that impaired glucose tolerance in aging may be due at least inpart to the diminished dietary carbohydrateintake often observed in elderly persons (Peters& Davidson, 1997). It has been shown thatincreased carbohydrate intake improves glucosetolerance in both young and old subjects.However, the older subjects exhibit decreasedglucose tolerance at each level of matched car-bohydrate intake when compared to the youngerpopulation (Chen et al., 1987). This idea is28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 203 204 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems supported by studies showing that when old andyoung subjects are fed diets comparable in car-bohydrate levels, age differences in glucose tol-erance, insulin secretion, and insulin action arediminished but still persistent (Halter, 2000).Thus, age itself appears to be correlated withdecreased glucose tolerance. However, poor lev-els of dietary carbohydrate intake are likely toexacerbate the age-related impairments in glu-cose metabolism. Polypharmacy. Several pharmacologic agents are known to affect glucose metabolism, andolder adults are frequent users of such agents.Therefore, when evaluating alterations in bloodglucose levels among elders, their medicationregimens must be considered and attentionmust be paid to potential drug interactions(Minaker, 1990; Morley & Perry, 1991). Drugsknown to affect glucose metabolism include,but are not limited to, /H9252-blockers, calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, and othernonpharmacologic agents caf-feine, and & DeFronzo, 1997).Furthermore, in treating be used withcaution. These pharmacologic agents stimulateinsulin and can contribute to thedevelopment of hypoglycemia (Graal &Wolffenbuttel, 1999). In addition, the interac-tion of sulphonylureas with some drugs canincrease the hypoglycemic effect of the sulpho-nylureas (Peters & Davidson, 1997). Thus, el-derly persons are at increased risk for thedevelopment of prolonged hypoglycemia whentreated with sulphonylureas. The Muscle The body's muscular system is composed ofthree types of muscle\u2014 skeletal muscle ,smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. Skeletalmuscles, examples of which include the bicep,tricep, quadricep, hamstring, and gastrocne-mius (calf) muscle, make up the majority of thebody's overall muscle mass. Skeletal muscle isalso the muscle type in which most age-relatedchanges occur. Thus, skeletal muscle and itschanges with age will be the focus of our dis-cussion about the aging muscle. Skeletal Muscle: Structure andFunction Skeletal muscles are composed of several thinmuscle bundles ( Figure 6-17 ). These bundles are held together with connective tissue but areable to move independently of one another(Arking, 1998). The muscle bundles are com-posed of several muscle fibers, each of which isformed from the fusion of numerous individualmyofibrils . Myofibrils contain myosins . Actin and myosin molecules a parallel, overlappingmanner within compartments called sarco- meres . The overlap of actin and myosin within the sarcomere results in a pattern of alternatinglight and dark bands, which accounts for thestriated, or striped, appearance of skeletal mus-cle. In a state of rest, actin molecules overlapboth ends of the myosin molecules, which arecentered within the sarcomere. Muscle contrac-tion results when actin molecules are pulledtoward the center of the sarcomere in a ratchet-ing motion ( Figure 6-18 ). This contraction of skeletal muscle is controlled by an individual'sown volition; hence, skeletal muscle has alsobeen termed voluntary muscle. Although muscle fibers have a common basic structure, they can be divided into two distinctphysiological types, fast-twitch and slow-twitch28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 204 The Muscle 205 Figure 6-17 Structure of the skeletal muscle fiber, myofibril, and sarcomere.

These two fiber types produce the same amount of force per contraction; however, theyproduce this force at different rates. White fast-twitch fibers contract quickly and provide shortbursts of energy, but they fatigue quickly. As aresult of these contractile properties, fast-twitchfibers are generally used for high-intensity, low-endurance, generally anaerobic activities such assprinting and weight lifting. Red slow-twitchfibers contract slowly but steadily and are noteasily fatigued. Therefore, these fibers are bestsuited for use in aerobic activities of low inten-sity but high endurance, such as long-distancerunning. Slow-twitch fibers are also used for pos-tural activities, such as the supporting of thehead by the neck. Every person is born with afixed ratio of fast-twitch to slow-twitch musclefibers. However, the ratio may vary from onebody location to another, and one person mayhave a greater ratio of fast-twitch to slow-twitchfibers in a particular location than does anotherperson. This phenomenon is part of what canresult in one individual being, for example, abetter sprinter or better long-distance runnerthan another. Aging of the Skeletal Muscle SarcopeniaA reduction in muscle mass occurs to at leastsome degree in all elderly persons as comparedto young, healthy, physically active youngadults (Roubenoff, 2001). This reduction inmuscle mass is known as sarcopenia (from the Greek meaning poverty of flesh), and is distinctfrom muscle loss due to disease or starvation.One population-based study estimated that theprevalence of sarcopenia rises from 13%-24%in individuals under the age of 70 years togreater than 50% in persons over the age of 80years (Baumgartner et al., 1998). Sarcopenia isFigure 6-18 The interaction actin and myosin to produce skele-tal muscle contraction. Inorganicphosphate (P i) and ADP may be released during the contraction.

Older sarcopenicmen are reported to have 4.1 times higher ratesand women 3.6 times higher rates of disabilitythan their gender-specific counterparts withnormal muscle mass (Baumgartner et al., 1998). The total cross-sectional area of skeletal mus- cle is reported to decrease by as much as 40%between the ages of 20 and 60 years (Doherty,2003), with the greatest loss occurring in thelower limbs (Doherty, 2003; Vandervoot &Symons, 2001). Men are known to have greatertotal muscle mass than women; however, menexperience greater relative muscle loss with agethan do their female counterparts (Janssen,Heymsfield, Wang, & Ross, 2000). The reasonfor this gender difference has not been clearlydefined, but it is postulated to relate to hor-monal factors (Janssen et al., 2000). Althoughmen experience greater relative muscle loss, ithas been noted that sarcopenia may be of greaterconcern for older women given their longer lifeexpectancy and higher rates of disability in oldage (Roubenoff & Hughes, 2000). Gender is notthe only factor contributing to differences in therate of sarcopenia. The loss of muscle mass ishighly individualized and greatly dependentupon genetic, lifestyle, and other factors thatinfluence the varied mechanisms proposed tounderlie sarcopenia. The most commonly pro-posed mechanisms include a decline in the num-ber and size of muscle fibers, loss of motor units(described below), hormonal influences, alteredprotein synthesis, nutritional factors, and lackof physical activity. Changes in Muscle Fibers. With age, there is an overall loss in the number of both fast- andslow-twitch muscle fibers. By the ninth decade,approximately 50% fewer muscle fibers arepresent in the vastus lateralis muscle (the lateralportion of the quadriceps) than are observed inthe same muscle of a 20 year old (Lexell, Taylor,& Sjostrom, 1988). In addition, a reduction inthe size of muscle fibers has been observed, withthe greatest reduction seen in fast-twitch mus-cle fibers. Reduction in the size of fast-twitchfibers ranges from 20% to 50% with age,whereas slow-twitch fibers have been shown toreduce in size by only 1% to 25% as a personages (Doherty, 2003). Loss of Motor Units. Muscle fibers are inner- vated by motor nerves, which extend from thespinal cord. Each nerve innervates several mus-cle fibers. The combination of a single nerve andall the fibers it innervates is known as a motor unit, and it is this motor unit that allows mus- cles to contract. Beginning about the seventhdecade of an individual's life, the number offunctional motor units begins to decline pre-cipitously (Vandervoot & Symons, 2001). Onegroup of researchers found that the estimatednumber of motor units in the bicep-brachialismuscle declined by nearly half, from an averageof 911 motor units in subjects less than 60 yearsof age to 479 in subjects older than 60 years ofage (Brown, Strong, & Snow, 1988). A similardegree of motor unit loss was shown in a groupof subjects ages 60 to 80 years compared with agroup of subjects ages 20 to 40 years (Doherty& Brown, 1993). The loss of motor units with age is due to an age-related loss of muscle innervation (Deschenes,2004). As motor units are lost, surviving motornerves adopt muscle fibers that have been aban-doned due to their loss of innervation (Roubenoff,2001). This results in an increase in the size of theadopting motor unit. Thus, older persons gener-ally have larger, yet less efficient, motor units thando younger persons (Roubenoff, 2001). Because28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 207 208 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems these enlarged motor units are now responsible forthe contraction of a greater number of muscles,they are generally less efficient. This inefficiencycan lead to tremors and weakness (Enoka, 1997)and, together with the atrophy of fast-twitch mus-cle fibers, can result in a decline in coordinatedmuscle action (Morley, Baumgartner, Roubenoff,Mayer, & Nair, 2001). Furthermore, abandonedmuscle fibers that are not adopted by survivingmotor units begin to atrophy as a result of disusesecondary to their loss of innervation. This atro-phy contributes to an overall loss of muscle mass.Muscle atrophy secondary to nerve cell death isclearly demonstrated through the loss of musclemass observed in persons who have suffered astroke (Roubenoff, 2001). Influences. thatpromote the build-up of muscle. With age, lev-els of these hormones decline, thereby con-tributing to muscle atrophy and sarcopenia.Accelerated loss of muscle around the time ofmenopause lends support to the idea that estro-gen may play a role in the maintenance of mus-cle mass (Poehlman, Toth, & Gardner, 1995).There is evidence supporting estrogen replace-ment therapy as a means of attenuating the lossof muscle mass among older women (Dionne,Kinaman, & Poehlman, 2000; Phillips, Rook,Siddle, Bruce, & Woledge,1993). However,some research suggests that the beneficial effectsof estrogen replacement are most pronounced inthe perimenopausal period and may have littleto no effect on the loss of muscle mass amongpostmenopausal women (Doherty, 2003).Among older men, testosterone supplementa-tion has been shown to increase muscle mass;however, studies performed to date have beenconducted among healthy older men. It is notknown whether testosterone supplementationwould have the same beneficial effects on mus-cle mass in older men with physical impair-ments, chronic disease, or frailty (Bhasin, 2003).Testosterone has also been shown to increasemuscle strength among elderly women (Davis,McCloud, Strauss, & Burger, 1995). Growth hormone (GH) (see \"The Endocrine System\" earlier in this chapter) is another ana-bolic hormone that declines with age. Thedecline in GH begins during the fourth decadeof life and parallels the decline in muscle mass(Roubenoff, 2001). Because of the strong asso-ciation between GH and muscle mass, adminis-tration of GH has been suggested as a potentialmethod by which age-related loss of musclemass might be attenuated. However, researchinvestigating the effects of GH on muscle masshas produced equivocal results, and there is noevidence that GH administration results in anyincrease in muscle strength (Borst, 2004). Inaddition, the use of GH is accompanied bynumerous side effects including fluid retention,hypotension, and carpal tunnel syndrome, andthese side effects are reported to be more severeamong older persons (Borst, 2004). Given theequivocal results regarding its efficacy as well asthe side effects associated with its use, GH is notrecommended as an intervention for sarcopenia(Doherty, 2003). Protein Synthesis. After exclusion of water, protein is the primary component of skeletalmuscle and accounts for approximately 20% ofits weight (Proctor, Balagopal, & Nair, 1998).Furthermore, muscle is largest repos-itory for protein Balagopal et al., 1997; Proctoret al., 1998). When protein breakdown withinthe body exceeds protein synthesis, muscle atro-phy occurs. Some research findings suggest thataging is associated with a reduced capacity ofskeletal muscle to synthesize protein. Such a28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 208 The Muscle 209 reduction is likely to lead to a decrease in mus-cle mass among elderly persons. However, otherresearch (Volpi, Sheffield-Moore, Rasmussen, &Wolfe, 2001) has found no difference in the syn-thesis rate of muscle protein with age. Thus,further studies are needed to elucidate the rolethat protein synthesis plays in sarcopenia. Nutritional Factors. Food intake declines with age, with greater decline occurring amongmen than women (Morley et al., 2001). Thisdecline is often referred to as the anorexia of aging , and is hypothesized to be associated with a decrease in the senses of smell and taste as wellas an earlier rate of satiation with age (Morley etal., 2001). It is thought that the anorexia ofaging may result in protein intake below thelevel necessary to maintain muscle mass andconsequently contribute to sarcopenia (Morleyet al., 2001). However, the degree to whichalterations in protein intake with age may playa role in age-related loss of muscle mass isunknown and requires further study. Muscle StrengthLoss of muscle strength , the muscle's capacity to generate force, is thought to be secondary todeclines in muscle mass (Ivey et al., 2000), anddecreases in muscle strength are seen withadvancing age. Data from one study demon-strated that 71% of men between the ages of 40and 59 and 85% of men age 60 or older haddeclines in muscle strength over a 9-year period(Kallman, Plato, & Tobin, 1990). Age-relateddecreases in strength are reported to range from20%-40%, with even greater decreases of 50%or more occurring in persons in their ninthdecade or beyond (Doherty, 2003). Older menexperience greater absolute declines in musclestrength than women; however, because menhave greater total muscle mass than women, rel-ative losses in strength are similar betweenmales and females (Doherty, 2003). The rate atwhich the decline in muscle strength occurs hasnot been well defined, but longitudinal studieshave shown rates of strength loss of about1%-3% per year (Doherty, 2003). Muscle QualityIn addition to declines in muscle mass andstrength, advancing age is also associated witha loss of muscle quality , strength generated per unit of muscle mass. However, research showsthat age-related declines in muscle quality dif-fer by both gender and muscle group. A study(Lynch et al., 1999) of arm and leg muscle qual-ity in men and women found that age-relateddifferences in arm muscle quality declined moreamong males than females, yet leg muscle qual-ity declined at similar rates among both gen-ders. In addition, among men the rates ofdecline of leg and arm muscle quality were sim-ilar. However, among women there was a greaterrate of decline of leg muscle quality than armmuscle quality. Thus, age-related decline inmuscle quality is highly variable, and studiesexamining this decline should be vigilant toinclude various muscle groups as well as sub-jects of both genders. Resistance Training and Aging Muscle Older persons who are less physically active haveless muscle mass and greater rates of disabilitythan persons who remain physically active asthey age (Evans, 2002). There is a large body ofevidence demonstrating that exercise cannotonly slow or prevent muscle loss with age, butalso increase muscle mass as well as musclestrength among older persons. Resistance exer-cise, exercise aimed at increasing the force28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 209 210 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems generated by muscle, has been shown to have themost beneficial effects on aging muscle. Onestudy (Frontera, Meredith, O'Reilly, Knuttgen,& Evans, 1988) of 66-year-old men found that a12-week program of resistance training resultedin significant increases in the cross-sectional areaof both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers.In addition, muscle strength improved signifi-cantly. Even among very elderly persons, resis-tance exercise has shown benefits for age-relatedchanges in muscle. An 8-week resistance trainingprogram conducted among men and women intheir 90s resulted in a 15% increase in musclecross-sectional area and a nearly 175% increase inthe amount of weight subjects were capable oflifting (Fiatarone et al., 1990). Numerous otherstudies have shown that resistance training pro-grams of 10 to 12 weeks duration, with training2-3 days per week, result in significant increasesin muscle strength among older persons(Doherty, 2003). It has been reported that resis-tance training may restore approximately 75% oflost muscle mass and 40% of lost muscle strength(Roubenoff, 2003). Resistance training has also been shown to improve muscle quality. Following a 9-weektraining program, older men and womenshowed statistically significant increases in mus-cle quality. Furthermore, subsequent to the ini-tial 9-week program there was a 31-weekdetraining period after which levels of musclequality remained significantly greater than lev-els measured before the start of the 9-week pro-gram (Ivey et al., 2000). Finally, there is also evidence to support an increase in protein synthesis with resistance exer-cise. One study reported an approximately 50%increase in protein synthesis among 65- to 75-year-old men following a 16-week progressive resis-tance training program (Yarasheski, Zackwieja,Campbell, & Bier, 1995). Improvements in pro-tein synthesis have also been demonstratedamong frail elderly men and women ages 76-92years (Yarasheski et al., 1999). Other research hasreported increases in protein synthesis of over100% following resistance training (Hasten,Pak-Loduca, Obert, & Yarasheski, 2000). The plethora of benefits to muscle that result from resistance training demonstrate theextreme importance of regular physical activity,especially of the resistance type, among agingmen and women. It is no wonder that manyhave cited resistance training as the most impor-tant factor in preventing and even reversing thelosses in muscle mass, strength, and power thatcome with advancing age. The Skeletal System The skeletal system is composed of the 206 bones of the body as well as the joints thatconnect them. The skeleton, extremely strongyet relatively light in weight, gives shape andsupport to the human body. It also acts to pro-tect the body; for example, the skull protectsthe brain and eyes while the ribs protect theheart and the vertebrae protect the spinal cord.The skeleton also provides a structure to whichmuscles can attach by tendons, enabling thebody to move. Furthermore, it acts as a set oflevers to modify movement provided by themuscles, increasing or decreasing the distance,speed, and force obtained from muscle contrac-tion (Digiovanna, 1994). When one considersthe importance of the functions performed bythe skeletal system, it becomes apparent thatany alteration or destruction of the skeletal sys-tem would have potentially serious conse-quences for the overall health and physicalfunctioning of the human body.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 210 The Skeletal System 211 Bone In addition to the aforementioned functions of theskeletal system, each component of bone has itsown unique function(s). A principal function ofbone is mineral storage and the maintenance offree mineral homeostasis. The predominant min-eral stored within bone is calcium. Calcium is nec-essary for, among other things, muscle contractionand nerve impulse conduction. If it is to aid inthese functions, calcium must be readily and con-tinuously available in a free form. Yet too muchfree calcium may be toxic and too little calciummay impair or prevent cell functioning. Thus,there must be a means of maintaining mineralhomeostasis. Bone cells assist in this maintenance. Bone cells are of three types\u2014 and minerals toproduce a bone matrix; hence, it is these cellsthat are responsible for the construction of newbone and the repair of damaged or broken bone.In time, some osteoblasts become embedded inthe bone matrix they produce. They thenbecome dormant and are termed osteocytes. Thethird bone cell type is the osteoclast, whichbreak down or resorb existing bone, dissolvingminerals of the bone matrix so that these min-erals can be used by the body. The formation and resorption of bone are not separately regulated processes. Osteoblasts andosteoclasts occur together in temporaryanatomic structures known as basic multicel- lular units (BMUs) . A mature BMU is com- posed of both cell types, a vascular supply, anerve supply, and connective tissue (Manolagas,2000). A BMU has a lifespan of approximately6-9 months, longer than the lifespan ofosteoblasts and osteoclasts. Thus, the BMUmust be continually supplied with new cells. During development and growth, BMUs mold bone to achieve proper size and shape byosteoclastic removal of bone from one site andosteoblastic deposition at a different one. Thisprocess is known as modeling. By adulthood, theskeleton has reached maturity and modeling nolonger occurs. However, in adulthood there isperiodic replacement of old bone with new bone,and this process is known as bone remodeling.Through bone remodeling, the human skeletonis completely regenerated every 10 years(Manolagas, 2000). The purpose of bone remod-eling is not well understood; however, it ishypothesized that remodeling occurs to repairfatigue and damage and to prevent excessiveFigure 6-19 Cross-section through a bony trabecula.

Thus, the primary purpose of boneremodeling may be to attenuate if not preventthe accumulation of old bone (Manolagas, 2000). Bone remodeling by the osteoblasts and osteoclasts is principally controlled throughhormonal regulation. As previously noted in thediscussion of the endocrine system, thyroid cal-citonin inhibits bone resorption, lowering bloodcalcium levels. Parathyroid hormone from theparathyroid gland has the opposite effect\u2014itincreases bone resorption and mobilizes calcium,thereby increasing blood calcium levels. Otherhormones are also involved in bone remodeling,yet often indirectly. Glucocorticoids promotebone resorption, and growth hormone andinsulin work to increase bone formation. Bone TypesThere are two types of bone\u2014cortical or compactbone and trabecular or spongy bone. Cortical bone comprises the outer layer of bone and is composed of numerous osteons\u2014long, narrowcylinders of bone matrix. The osteons are tightlyfused to one another and possess a complex sys-tem of blood vessels and nerves. Osteons are con-tinually dissolved and replaced anew. Corticalbone surrounds and protects trabecular bone and provides the majority of skeletal strength. Trabecular bone makes up the inner portion of bone and is composed of small pieces of bonematrix known as trabeculae. The trabeculae arearranged in very irregular patterns. Comparedto cortical bone, trabecular bone provides onlyminimal skeletal strength. The ratio of corticalbone to trabecular bone varies throughout thebody. Cortical bone is predominant in the limbswhereas trabecular bone is predominant inbones of the axial skeleton, such as the ribs, ver-tebrae, and skull.Aging of the Bone Bone LossIn order to ensure that there is no net loss ofbone, the amount of bone resorbed by the BMUmust exceed the amount formed. As the bodyages, it loses the ability to maintain this balancebetween bone resorption and formation. TheBMU is said to be in a negative balance andbone loss occurs. Negative BMU balance beginsas early as the third decade, long beforemenopause in women (Seeman, 2003a). Afterseveral decades have passed, skeletal mass maybe reduced to half of what it was at 30 years ofage (P . S. Timiras, 2003b). The osteoclast lifespan is increased by estro- gen deficiency whereas the lifespan of osteoblastsdeclines with such a deficiency. Consequently,BMU balance becomes more negative. Thus,estrogen deficiency is a key contributor to boneloss, and bone loss accelerates in women aftermenopause due to a decline in estrogen levels(Seeman, 2003a). Simultaneously, as osteoclastactivity increases and more bone is resorbed, theremaining bone becomes more porous. Theresult of this increased porosity is a decline inbone mineral density. Unfortunately, bone losscontinues from the lower density bone and at ahigher rate than before menopause. Theincreased rapidity of bone loss is explained by 1)the increasingly negative BMU, 2) a higherremodeling rate, and 3) reduction in the mineralcontent of bone due to the replacement of older,more densely mineralized bone with younger,less densely mineralized bone (Seeman, 2003b). Estrogen deficiency also plays a role in bone loss among men. Although men do not undergothe midlife acceleration in bone remodelingcharacteristically seen in women, decreased bone28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 212 The Skeletal System 213 mineral density among men is due to a declinein levels of estrogen, not testosterone (Seeman,2003a). It has been that estrogen mayregulate bone resorption whereas both estrogenand testosterone may regulate bone formation(Falahati-Nini et al., 2000). At any given agebone mass is greater in men than in women, butthe rate of bone loss is generally acceleratedamong women (Arking, 1998). However, theoverall loss of bone is quantitatively similar inpersons of both genders, suggesting that boneloss may occur over a longer period of time inmen than in women (Seeman, 2003b).Bone TypeThe majority of bone remodeling occurs withintrabecular bone, and in both men and womenbone loss occurs at least a decade earlier in tra-becular bone than in cortical bone (Arking,1998). As the body ages, trabeculae become thin-ner and weaker. In addition, some may disappearentirely and cannot be replaced. As a result ofthese changes the bone becomes permanentlyweaker at the site of trabeculae thinning or loss.Furthermore, some trabeculae may become dis-connected from the others, resulting in a declinein bone strength (Digiovanna, 1994). Corticol bone loss is not detected until about 40 years of age, at which time the rate of lossbegins to increase. However, the loss of corticalbone still occurs at only half the rate of trabec-ular bone loss (Digiovanna, 1994). Loss of tra-becular bone occurs from the inside of the boneoutward. Normally, old osteons shrink and aredissolved while new osteons form next to themand eventually fill the space left by the old ones.With age, however, new osteons are unable tofill this space completely, leaving larger andlarger gaps between existing osteons. The resultis a weakening of the bone.Bone StrengthWith age there is not only a loss of bone, but alsoa loss of bone strength. This loss of strength hasbeen attributed to at least two different processes.The first is the increased porosity of bone thatoccurs due to continuous bone remodeling.Greater porosity reduces the structural strengthof bone. The second is an age-related increase inbone mineralization leading to increased brittle-ness of bone (Arking, 1998). In childhoodapproximately two thirds of bone is composed ofcollagen and connective tissues whereas in agedindividuals minerals comprise two thirds of bonestructure (P . S. Timiras, 2003b). Bone strength isa property that allows bone to withstand forcesapplied to the skeleton during movements suchas bending and stretching. Strong, young boneswill respond to force with flexibility and resil-ience, bending as needed. But aged bones aremore likely to snap when subjected to force.Consequently, the age-associated decline in bonestrength increases older persons' risk of bone frac-ture (Arking, 1998). See below for further dis-cussion of bone fractures among older persons. Age-Related Disease and Injuryof the Bone OsteoporosisOsteoporosis is a disease that results from reduc-tions in bone quantity and strength that aregreater than the usual age-related reductions.Bones of those with osteoporosis are generallyvery porous, containing numerous holes orempty pockets. In addition, they are thin andfragile and, consequently, extremely prone to28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 213 214 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems fracture (discussed below). An estimated 10 mil-lion Americans suffer from osteoporosis andanother 34 million have low bone mass that putsthem at increased risk for the disease. The major-ity of osteoporosis cases, 8 million (80%), occurin women whereas only 2 million (20%) occur inmen (National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2004).Bone FractureOsteoporosis and the general progressive loss ofbone mass with age leads to increased risk of frac-ture among older persons. Fifty percent of womenand 25% of men over the age of 50 years willexperience an osteoporosis-related fracture intheir lifetime. Fractures in elderly persons oftenoccur as the result of only minimal or moderatetrauma whereas in younger persons considerableforce is required to fracture a bone. In addition,the fractures that occur in old age generally occurat different sites than those that occur at youngerages. Among younger persons the most commonsite of fracture is the bone shaft, yet in older per-sons fractures generally occur next to a joint (P . S.Timiras, 2003b). Regardless of the site of frac-ture, fractures among older adults are generallymore difficult to prevent or repair, and recoveryfrom fracture occurs much more slowly in olderpersons than in young individuals. In young adults fractures occur more fre- quently among males than females. This ishypothesized to be the result of males' generallymore frequent engagement in physical activityand exposure to accidental falls (P . S. Timiras,2003b). In older adults, however, women gen-erally experience greater fracture rates than men.This gender difference may be due, at least inpart, to the fact that women begin life with asmaller skeleton that adapts less well to agingthan that of men (Seeman, 2002). This genderdifference in fracture incidence with age is mostevident in fractures of the vertebrae, forearm,and hip (P . S. Timiras, 2003b). There are also racial differences in the rate of fracture. The rates of fracture associated with oldage are significantly lower among AfricanAmericans than Caucasians, specifically threetimes lower among African American womenand five times lower among African Americanmen. These racial differences may be explainedby the 10% to 20% greater bone mass and den-sity of adult bone among African Americans. Inaddition, bone remodeling occurs more slowlyamong African Americans than Caucasians (P . S.Timiras, 2003b). Joints Joints or articulations are junctions between twoor more bones. Three types of joints comprisethe body's articular system. Immovable joints or fibrous joints consist of collagen fibers thatbind bones tightly together. The toughness ofcollagen allows minimal, if any, shifting ofbones, and as such the joints are immovable.Skull bones are examples of immovable joints.These joints keep the skull in place, allowingsupport and protection of the brain. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which a layer of cartilage separates the two connectedbones. These joints may also have ligaments toaid in holding bones together. Cartilaginousjoints allow for slight movement. Examples ofthis type of joint include the joints between ver-tebrae. These cartilaginous joints are known asintervertebral disks, and together with strongligaments they hold the vertebrae together andaid the vertebrae in supporting the weight ofthe body. They also allow the vertebral columnto bend and twist slightly. The third and most common type of joint is the synovial joint . The bones that this type of28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 214 The Skeletal System 215 joint connects contain smooth cartilage on theiropposing ends. This cartilage minimizes frictionwhen the joint moves. A sleeve of connective tis-sue encapsulates the ends of the two bones thathave been joined. The joint capsule is lined withthe synovium , a membrane that secretes syn- ovial fluid . The fluid is thick and slippery, allowing easy movements of the bones. In addi-tion, it absorbs part of the shock sustained by thejoint. Although synovial joints, together withreinforcing ligaments, bind two bones tightlytogether, they are characterized by free range ofmotion. Nearly all the joints in the arms, legs,shoulders, and hips are synovial joints. Aging of the Joints Immovable JointsWith increasing age the collagen between thebones of immovable joints becomes coated withbone matrix. As a result, the space between bonesgets even narrower and the bones may eventuallyfuse together completely. Consequently, the jointsbecome stronger. Therefore, with age immovablejoints actually improve.Cartilaginous JointsThe aging process is associated with a stiffeningof the cartilage comprising cartilaginous joints.Ligaments also become stiffer and less elastic. Theresult of these changes is a reduction in theamount of movement allowed by the cartilaginousjoints. Vertebral movement is decreased and thereis a decline in the ability of intervertebral disksto support the body and cushion the spinal cord.With age the vertebrae weaken and, as a result,the weight of the body forces the intervertebraldisk to expand into the vertebrae, forming a con-cave region. This change appears to force more ofthe weight of the body onto the outer edge of theintervertebral disk, compressing the disk (Digio-vanna, 1994). The result is a shortening of thespinal column and a decrease in body height. Synovial JointsThe functional ability of synovial joints beginsto decline around 20 years of age (Digiovanna,1994). As a person ages both the joint capsuleand the ligaments become shorter, stiffer, andless able to stretch. In addition, the cartilage lin-ing the bones becomes calcified, thinner, andless resilient (Arking, 1998). Consequently, itbecomes more difficult to move, and range ofmotion and efficiency of the joint are reduced.As a result, both the initiation and speed ofmovement begin to slow with age. This leads toa lessened ability to maintain balance and makesit difficult to act quickly to minimize the forceof impact resulting from a fall or other physi-cally harmful event. With age the synovial membrane also becomes stiffer and less elastic. In addition, it loses someof its vasculature, which in turn reduces its abil-ity to produce synovial fluid. The fluid that isproduced is thinner and less viscous (Arking,1998). As a result of these changes in the synovialmembrane and fluid, there is a decline in the easeand comfort with which the joints move withinthe joint capsule as a person ages. The net result of the aging of synovial joints is often increased injury and decreased activityperformance. However, there is evidence todemonstrate that this net result can be slowedor minimized through continual physical activ-ity. Exercise can increase flexibility of the jointcomponents and also appears to increase circu-lation to the joints (Digiovanna, 1994). It should be noted here that at least some, if not many, of the changes in joints with age maybe due not to the aging process but to repeated28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 215 216 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems injuries the joints experience over time due tothe performance of regular daily activities. It isoften difficult to distinguish these latter effectsfrom true biological aging (Digiovanna, 1994). Disease of the Joints OsteoarthritisAge-related changes in the joints often result inor are compounded by arthritis, a disease char-acterized by inflammation of the joints andaccompanied by joint pain and injury. There aremore than 100 different types of arthritis, butthe two most common forms are osteoarthritisand rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, accounting for more than halfof all arthritis cases (Digiovanna, 1994). Morethan 20 million people in the United Stateshave osteoarthritis, and the disease is muchmore common among older persons. More thanhalf of people 65 years of age or older wouldshow x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis in at leastone joint. Before age 45, osteoarthritis is morecommon among men, but after age 45 it be-comes more common in women (National Insti-tute of Arthrtis and Musculoskeletal and SkinDiseases, 2002). Osteoarthritis frequently affects the weight- bearing joints, such as the hips, knees, and lowerspine. Finger joints also are common sites ofosteoarthritis. This form of arthritis causes abreakdown and weakening of cartilage, whichresults in a decreased ability to cushion the endsof the bones. If enough cartilage is lost, the boneswill begin to rub against each other. The bonesthen respond by producing more bone matrix,which builds up and can lead to an enlargementof the joints and difficulty in joint movement. Inaddition, the bone matrix produced may berough and jagged and, when it rubs against softtissues, can cause pain. Furthermore, with agethere is a decrease in synovial fluid concentrationand viscosity. This decrease may lower the lubri-cating and cushioning properties of the joints,making movement of the joint difficult andpainful (Moskowitz, Kelly, & Lewallen, 2004). The Sensory System The sensory system provides constant stimu-lation to the body and relays important mes-sages to the mind and body. The sensorysystem may be viewed as a system that canevoke emotion and memories, and when dis-rupted can influence quality of life (Arking,1998; Digiovanna, 1994; Weiffenbach, 1991).Age-related changes to touch, smell, taste, vi-sion, and hearing lead older individuals tointeract with the environment differently thanthey did at a younger age. Touch The ability to touch and distinguish texture andsensation tends to decline with age due to adecrease in the number and alteration in thestructural integrity of touch receptors, or Meissner'scorpuscles, and the pressure receptors, or thePacinian corpuscles (Arking, 1998; Digiovanna,1994, 2000). Receptors that are related to thesense of touch are also known as mechanore- ceptors . See Figure 6-20 for an illustration and location of mechanoreceptors in the integumen-tary system. Changes to these touch and pressurereceptors lead to a decrease in the ability toacknowledge that an object is touching or apply-ing pressure to the skin; a decrease in the abilityto identify where the touch or pressure is occur-ring; an inability to distinguish between howmany objects are touching the skin; and adecreased ability to identify objects just by touch(Digiovanna, 1994, 2000).

(See the follow-ing section, \"The Integumentary System.\")Arking (1998) suggests that the skin on thehands, the most sensitive to touch, undergoes themost age-related change in touch. In addition tothe hands, Stevens and Choo (1996) found thatthe feet undergo major declines in touch sensi-tivity with age. This conclusion may be explainedby a higher concentration of receptors in thehands and feet whereas the rest of the body has alarger surface area over which receptors are dis-persed. Stevens and Patterson (1995) conducteda spatial acuity study of touch that involvedchanges in stimuli related to discontinuity, skinlocation, and area on the skin as well as changesin the orientation of stimuli in older versusyounger adults. Conclusions from this studyshowed that all four acuity measures declinedwith age at a rate of 1% per year between the agesof 20 and 80. Furthermore, these researchersdemonstrated that acuity at sites such as the fore-arm and lip declined less quickly than acuity inthe fingertips. These changes to touch can berelated to a decline in the number of sensory neu-rons and a decreased ability of the remaining sen-sory neurons to efficiently relay signals critical tothe detection, location, and identification oftouch or pressure on the skin (Digiovanna, 1994,2000). Smell Olfactory System AnatomyThe chemical senses of smell and taste worktogether and influence each other as a functionalentity (Weiffenbach, 1991). The olfactory sys-tem contains supporting pro-duction, olfactory receptors, and basal cells thatreplenish every 2 months and eventually trans-form into new olfactory receptors and the actualolfactory receptors (Sherwood, 1997). Whenbasal cells transform into receptors the entireneuron, including the axon that projects intothe brain, is completely replaced (Sherwood,1997). The olfactory axons connect to the olfac-tory bulb and layer. Thenerve layer synapses glomerulus, to the ofthe brain (Kovacs, 2004). Approximately 5 mil-lion olfactory receptors of about 1,000 differenttypes are located in the nose. Each receptor typedetects one miniscule component of an odorinstead of the odor as a whole (Sherwood, 1997). Age-Related Olfactory ChangesOlfaction , or the sense of smell, appears to be reduced with age, as demonstrated by thresholdstudies of stimulus strength. A decrease in smellis also referred to as hyposmia (Seiberling &Conley, 2004). Evidence shows peaks in thesenses of smell and taste during the 20s and 40s,but by the 60s and 70s there is a decline in olfac-tion. This decline includes reduced ability forboth odor detection and identification, especiallyamong males. Over 50% of people age 65 yearsor significant olfactory dysfunction(Arking, 1998; ofolfactory neurons and weakening of olfactoryneural pathways to the brain lead to a reductionin the ability to identify and distinguish aromas(Digiovanna, 1994, 2000; Seiberling & Conley,2004). At the age of 25 years, the olfactory bulbcontains approximately 60,000 mitral cells. Bythe age of 95 years, there are only 14,500 mitralcells. This decline in cell numbers decreases thefunctional ability of the olfactory neural system28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 218 The Sensory System 219 (Bhatnagar, Kennedy, Baron, & Greenberg, 1987).As discussed in \"The Nervous System\" section,neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques canbe observed in the aging brain and have beendocumented in the olfactory bulb (Kovacs, correlates. Age-related gen-der differences include that males show greaterdeclines in detection and identification of odorsthan do females (Arking, 1998; Kovacs, 2004). Concerns associated with the declining sense of smell in older populations include the inabil-ity to smell harmful odors such as gas or smokein the home and the inability to smell pleasur-able memory-invoking aromas such as flowers(Digiovanna, 1994, 2000; Kovacs, 2004;Stevens, Cain, & Weinstein, 1987). A decline inthe ability to smell can also influence the senseof taste, often causing older individuals tochange their eating habits and to receive lessenjoyment from food (Cowart, 1989; White &Ham, 1997). The decline in smell is much morepredominant than the decline in taste, but indi-viduals often say that the sense of taste haschanged when actually it is the sense of smellthat is impaired (Seiberling & Conley, 2004).

PM Page 219 220 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Taste Anatomy of GustationTaste, or gustation, and the chemoreceptors for taste are located in approximately 10,000taste buds found mostly on the tongue, but alsoin the rest of the oral cavity and throat(Sherwood, 1997). Taste receptors constantlyrenew about every 10 days through generationof new receptor cells (Sherwood, 1997). The fourprimary tastes include sweet, salty, bitter, andsour with a proposed fifth primary taste knownas umami, an amino acid and peptide(Digiovanna, 1994, 2000; Sherwood, 1997). Age-Related Gustation ChangesAging causes a decrease in taste, also known ashypogeusia , usually more noticeable around the age of 60 with more severe declines occur-ring over the age of 70 (Seiberling & Conley,2004). However, the sense of taste seems todecrease only slightly with age and can be vari-able among individuals (Digiovanna, 1994,2000). Threshold studies, or studies that eval-uate the lowest level of stimulus needed to reachthreshold to invoke a response, are often used tomeasure taste (Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). Thres-hold studies have demonstrated some age-related, quality-specific changes in taste. Theability to detect salt changes the most with agewhereas detection of sugar does not appear with age are not as well under-stood as changes in smell, but it has beenhypothesized that there is a decrease in thenumber of taste buds as well as a change in tastereceptors and cell membrane ion channels withage (Mistretta, 1984; Seiberling & Conley,2004). Because taste buds have the ability toregenerate every 10 days, any changes in tasteare most likely correlated with disruptions intaste receptors and cell membranes. Of course,taste sensation can be disrupted for other reasonsincluding medication use, smoking, disease, in-fections, and poor oral health (Schiffman, 1997;Seiberling & Conley, 2004). The most commonconcerns related to changes in taste, which arestrongly tied to changes in smell, are food poi-soning and malnutrition (Schiffman, 1997). Vision The eyes monitor objects and conditions aroundthe body, continually sending sensory messagesto the brain such that the body can elicit appro-priate responses to the outside environment(Digiovanna, 2000). Anatomy and Age-Related Changes inEye StructureMany older adults experience dry eyes and/or afeeling of irritation, as if an object is in the eye.This condition is known as dry eye syndrome(Kollarits, 1998). Dry eye syndrome may beexplained by age-related decline in the amountof tears produced by the conjuctiva, the thinsurface layer of the eye that is exposed to air. Theconjuctiva normally helps to lubricate the eyeand eyelid (Digiovanna, Kalina,1999). the conjuctiva, reflects light travelingthrough the eye; with age the cornea tends todecrease in transparency. This decrease can causea reduction in the amount of light entering theeye as well as an increase in light scattering(Digiovanna, 1994, 2000). The scattered lightstill reaches the retina, albeit in incorrect areascausing bright areas in the field of view. Thisphenomenon is known as glare (Digiovanna,28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 220 The Sensory System 221 1994, 2000). See Figure 6-22 for an overview of the physiology of the eye. Behind the cornealies the iris, which contains a hole called thepupil. The pupil allows light to pass into the eye(Digiovanna, 1994 2000). Collagen fibers in the eye begin to thicken and muscle cell numbers decrease with age.These changes reduce the ability of the pupiland iris to work together to constrict and dilate.As a result, the eye is unable to appropriatelyadapt to changing light intensities (Digiovanna,1994, 2000; Kalina, 1999). The lens of the eyedemonstrates an age-related loss of elasticitythat has also been attributed to changes in col-lagen fibers. With age, the lens of the eyebecomes less curved and more flat. In addition,there is a decreased transparency to colors oflight, especially blue, and formation of opaquespots that block and scatter light (Digiovanna,1994, 2000). Retinal rods of the eye that areresponsible for low light vision demonstrateage-related changes, whereas retinal conesremain relatively stable (Kalina, 1999). Thecenter of the eye contains vitreous humor, a gelcontaining collagen fibrils. With age, the vit-reous humor loses transparency and there is anincrease in the scattering of light, which maypotentially cause floaters (Digiovanna, 2000;Kalina, 1999; Kollarits, 1998).

All of theseage-related structural changes in the eye explainmany of the age-associated changes in vision. Age-Related Changes in Visual FunctionOne of the most common visual concerns inaging that occurs over time, but which becomesmost notable around 40 years of age and older,is presbyopia or the inability to focus on nearby objects, such as newsprint. This inability is alsoknown as farsightedness (Digiovanna, 1994;Jackson & Owsley, trifocals inlenses (Jackson & Owsley, 2003). Several stud-ies have shown a decline in visual acuity, or thesmallest object or detail that can be seen, evenin individuals wearing corrective lenses. Thisdecline may be correlated with a decrease in theneurons along the visual pathway as well aschanges in the actual lens of the eye (Jackson &Owsley, 2003). Sensitivity to contrast, or theability to observe a pattern in different light andintensity, also declines with age as a result ofchanges in the optics of the eye. Contrast sensi-tivity further declines under conditions of lowlight. Such a decline is likely due to changes inthe in contrastsensitivity is demonstrated by older individuals'complaints that driving and seeing road signs atnight is very difficult, prompting them to driveonly in daylight. All of these changes can beassociated with aging of the cornea. Cornealaging is characterized by decreased transparency,greater scattering of light, and a flattening effectthat results in reduced refraction, as previouslydescribed (Digiovanna, 1994). Another com-mon complaint among older individuals per-tains to changes in the visual field. Studies havedemonstrated a narrowing of both the centraland peripheral visual fields in older adults ascompared to those of young adults. Narrowingis greater in peripheral fields as a result of dis-ruption in the visual neural pathway (Haas,Flammer, & Schneider, 1986; Jackson & Owsley,2003; Johnson, Adams, & Lewis, 1989). Thisdecrease in the visual field area causes a lessenedability to visually search environmental sur-roundings, making it difficult to identify anddiscriminate objects and moving targets(Jackson & Owsley, 2003). Other consequencesof aging changes in the visual neural pathwayare demonstrated by decreased detection andawareness of moving objects as well as dimin-ished ability in distinguishing one motion fromanother very similar motion (Ball & Sekular,1986; Gilmore, Wenk, Naylor, & Stuve, 1992;Jackson & Owsley, 2003). For instance, a policeofficer directs traffic around an accident scene ona two-lane highway by motioning one lane toslow and stop while motioning a car in theopposite lane to proceed slowly around. From adistance the older driver may not be able toclearly distinguish the hand movements of theofficer until he or she is much closer to thescene. The speed with which individuals canvisually process information tends to slow in theolder adult. As a result, older adults need tofocus on an object for a longer period of time inorder to identify and describe it (Jackson &Owsley, 2003; Salthouse, 1993). Visual attention, divided attention, and selective attention also decrease with aging,more pronounced deficits occurring whenobjects or information are shown very quickly(Jackson & Owsley, 2003). Impaired divided28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 222 The Sensory System 223 attention can be observed when an older adult isgiven two simultaneous tasks to complete, suchas viewing a series of two pictures side by sideon a computer screen for 5 seconds. If the olderadult is instructed to learn the name on a build-ing in one picture and to count how many ani-mals are in the other picture, he or she willeventually begin to focus on only one picture. Age-related changes in color vision lead to impaired color discrimination, especially alongthe blue-yellow color continuum. This indi-cates increased absorption of short wavelengthsand a deficiency in those cones associated specif-ically with short wavelengths (Jackson &Owsley, 2003). The photoreceptors\u2014rods andcones\u2014also demonstrate age-related changes.The rod photoreceptors aid vision in the darkand in other low-light situations and demon-strate a greater age-related decline in densitythan do cone photoreceptors. Cone photorecep-tors aid vision in regular and bright light situ-ations and are involved in color vision. Thesephotoreceptors maintain relative stability indensity with age (Curcio, Millican, Allen, &Kalina, 1993; Jackson & Owsley, 2003). Thedecline in rod photoreceptors also provides evi-dence to support the common complaint ofolder individuals that they do not see as well atnight, especially when driving.Age-Related Eye DiseasesThe most common causes of vision loss in theolder adult population are cataracts, glaucoma,macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy(Heine & Browning, 2002; Jackson & Owsley,2003; Kollarits, 1998). These are all eye diseasesor conditions that present more frequently in theaging population, but should not be considered asusual aging. The presence of cataracts, or a de-crease in the transparency of the lens in the eye,is fairly common in the older population andeveryone who lives long enough will experiencesome degree of cataracts (Digiovanna, 1994;Kollarits, 1998). By the age of 75 approximately50% of older adults will show signs of cataractsand about 25% of these cases will be advancedcataracts, with more instances occurring in wo-men than men (Klein, Klein, & Linton, 1992a).Risk of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure,is partly genetic but is also subject to environ-mental influences. Glaucoma causes loss in theperipheral visual field (Duggal et al., 2005;Kollarits, 1998). In general, intraocular pressureincreases with age (Kalina, 1999). Around 2% ofindividuals in the United States over the age of 40experience glaucoma, with a higher prevalence inAfrican Americans (Kollarits, 1998). Adults age75 or older also demonstrate a high incidence ofmacular degeneration (Klein et al., 1992b), whichis a major cause of irreversible vision impairmentand blindness. It accounts for 22% of cases ofblindness in one eye and 75% of cases of legal blindness in adults 50 years of age or older (Klein,Wang, Klein, Moss, & Meuer, 1995). Diabeticretinopathy relates directly to the presence of dia-betes. Diabetes is a disease state and not a part ofusual aging; therefore, this topic will not be cov-ered in this section. Hearing The External CanalThe external canal of the ear consists of the vis-ible external ear opening, known as the pinnaor auricle, and the canal that extends to theeardrum or tympanic membrane (Digiovanna,2000; Patt, 1998). Small vellus hairs cover theentire ear canal and larger tragus hairs concen-trate only in the most external portion of thecanal (Patt, 1998). Cerumen glands situated in28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 223 224 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems the ear canal open into hair follicles and ontoskin producing the odor associated with ceru-men, or ear wax (Patt, 1998). Age-relatedshrinkage of cerumen glands causes cerumen tobecome dryer. In turn, there is often blockageof the external canal and a elasticity, external ear canals narrow,and the tympanic membrane stiffens (Heine &Browning, 2002; Schuknecht, 1974). The skinon the ear becomes thinner and more suscepti-ble to tears and infection (Rees et al., 1999).Hair on the external ear becomes longer anddenser (Digiovanna, 2000; Patt, 1998). The Middle EarThe middle ear consists of three small bonescalled the auditory ossicles amplify the vibrations sent from theexternal ear so as to maintain intensity of thesound wave traveling to the cochlea of the innerear (Digiovanna, 2000). The middle ear alsoloses elasticity and the ossicles tend to shrinkwith age (Heine & Browning, 2002; Patt, 1998;Schuknecht, 1974). Narrowing of the jointspace between ossicles occurs as a result of age-related calcification of the joint capsule anddeterioration of the cartilage. However, this nar-rowing does not seem to cause loss of soundwaves in the middle ear (Jerger et al., 1995;Patt, 1998; Rees et al., 1999). The Inner EarThe cochlea of the inner ear, also called the hear-ing organ, is spiral in shape and is filled withperilymph liquid (Digiovanna, 2000; Patt,1998). Within to the basilar membrane (Digiovanna,2000). See Figure 6-23 for a representation of ear anatomy as well as changes to the ear andhearing processes. The inner ear shows a loss ofelasticity in the basilar membrane as well asdegeneration of the organ of Corti, manifestedas increased shrinkage and loss of hair cells(Heine & Browning, 2002; Schuknecht, 1974).Degeneration of small blood vessels in thecochlea leads to a reduction in endolymph pro-duction and a diminished ability of vibrationsto travel through the ear (Digiovanna, 2000). Inthe auditory portion of the brain, the cortex dis-plays shrinkage, loss of neurons, and decreasedblood flow (Heine & Browning, 2002; Schuk-necht, 1974). Age-related hearing loss occurs asa result of changes in the inner ear (Digiovanna,2000; Rees et al., 1999).The Vestibular SystemThe inner ear encompasses as balance organs (Patt, 1998).In the vestibular system, age-related declineoccurs in cells, and sensorynerve fibers (Patt, 1998; Rees et al., 1999). Thevestibular system together with the eye and pro-prioceptors helps to maintain physical balanceof the body (Rees et al., 1999). Among thoseages 65 or older, 90% of reports of vertigo orother imbalance result in physician office visits(Patt, 1998; Rees et al., 1999). Hearing MechanismHearing is the result of sound waves enteringthe external ear and canal, traveling to the tym-panic membrane and sending vibrations accord-ing to sound wave intensity. These vibrationsare relayed to the ossicles and on toward thecochlea, which is considered the hearing organ28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 224 The Sensory System 225 (Jerger, Chmiel, Wilson, & Luchi, 1995). Thevibrations initiate a wave motion in the cochlea,causing changes in the basilar membrane and,in turn, stimulating the hair cells in the cochlea.Eventually signals are sent through nerve fibersto the central auditory system (Jerger et al.,1995). Hearing LossAging changes that cause hearing loss includethe alteration and decline in threshold sensitiv-ity, the ability to hear high frequency sounds,and the ability to discern speech (Rees et al.,1999). Age-related hearing loss, also known aspresbycusis , remains the most common sensory deficit in the older population. Approximately35% of men and women age 60 to 70 years and39% over the age of 75 report difficulty withconversation when they are in areas with back-ground noise (Fransen, Lemkens, Van Laer, &Van Camp, 2003; Rees al., 1999). Typically,hearing loss, observed more often among malesthan females, occurs in both ears. The ability tohear higher frequency sounds is generallyaffected the most. Hearing loss is most closelycorrelated with sensorineural disruption(Fransen et al., 2003; Rees et al., 1999). A constant decline in hearing is observed in aging. Higher frequencies are affected first andthen, with decreased hearing ability, the fre-quencies become more variable. Hearing acute-ness varies with age at the onset of hearing lossas well as with progressive states and hearingseverity (Fransen et al., 2003; Rees et al., 1999).Figure 6-23 The anatomy of the ear and the parts of the ear that show changes with age. Source: Adapted from Beth Hartwell, MD, http://medic.med.uth.tmc.edu/Lecture/Main/ear3.gif Facial nerve Vestibular 226 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Hearing loss has been physiologically corre-lated to loss of hair cells and cochlear neuronsas well as degeneration of the stria vascularis (Fransen et al., 2003). Four categoriesof presbycusis correlate the deterioration inhearing function with the changes in ear phys-iology, particularly changes in the cochlea.High-frequency hearing loss, or sensory pres-bycusis, results from the loss of hair cells in thecochlea of the ear. Strial presbycusis resultsfrom shrinkage of the vascularis. Neuralpresbycusis develops as a result of cochlear neu-ron deterioration and can cause a loss of theability to discriminate words. Finally, cochlearconductive presbycusis causes gradual thresh-old loss correlated with potential changes cochlear duct in the ear (Rees et al., 1999;Schuknecht & Gacek, 1993). Along with usualaging processes, intrinsic and extrinsic factorssuch as occupation, loud noise, nutrition, cho-lesterol, and arteriosclerosis also affect theauditory system (Digiovanna, 2000; Rees et al.,1999). Changes in the sensory system include changes in the anatomy of sensory organs andcorresponding neural circuits and brain areas.Age-related changes occur variably for everyindividual, meaning that one person may notexperience noticeable changes while anotherexperiences severe decrements or even completeloss of a sensory system. These changes impactthe older adult's quality of life on a variety oflevels. The Integumentary System The integumentary system consists of the skinand its derivatives, including hair, nails, and theeccrine (sweat) and sebaceous (oil) glands. Theintegumentary system protects the body's tis-sues and internal organs, serves as a barrieragainst injury and infection, regulates bodytemperature, and acts as a receptor for stimuli oftouch, pressure, and pain. It is also the physio-logical system that is most visible to the humaneye, and thus the system that most readily dis-plays the signs of aging. Skin: Structure and Function The skin, the largest of all human organs, iscomposed of three primary layers\u2014the epider-mis, the dermis, and the subcutaneous (seeFigure 6-20 earlier in the chapter). Each layerhas a unique structure and function.The EpidermisThe epidermis is the thin, outermost layer of the skin. It is composed of three primary cell types\u2014keratinocytes, melanocytes, and Langherans cells.Keratinocytes produce the protein keratin. As keratin accumulates in the cells, they begin toform a superficial layer of skin (known as the stra-tum corneum) that serves to protect the surfaceof the human body. Over time, the cells becomeentirely keratin-filled and die, at which pointthey are exfoliated, or shed, and replaced by newcells. This process of cell exfoliation and replace-ment is cyclical, with one cycle normally lasting14 to 28 days, depending on the region of thebody (M. L. Timiras, 2003). The melanocytes produce melanin , a pig- ment essential to protecting the body from ultra-violet (UV) rays. Exposure to UV radiation leadsto DNA and other damage in cells of both theepidermis and dermis. Melanin blocks andabsorbs UV radiation and, in so doing, protectsagainst cellular dysfunction and lowers the riskof tumor formation. Because of their role in pro-28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 226 The Integumentary System 227 tection against UV radiation, melanocytes arefound in increased numbers in sun-exposed skin. The Langerhans cells , although they com- prise only 1%-2% of epidermal cells (Fossel,2004), play a critical role in the body's immunedefense system, particularly cutaneous immunereactions. These cells recognize foreign antigensand, in response, activate immune defenses. Themain functions of Langerhans cells include anti-gen binding, processing, and presentation tona\u00efve T cells (see \"The Immune System\" later inthis chapter) 1999). Langerhans cells,in addition to responding to antigens, launchimmune responses to tumor cells. Thus, Langer-hans cells help to protect the body against bothinfection and skin cancer. In addition to these cellular functions, the epidermis plays a critical role in the productionof vitamin D 3, which is produced when its epi- dermal precursor form is activated through theskin's exposure to UV radiation, that is, sun-light (Yaar & Gilchrest, 2001). Ninety percentof the body's supply of vitamin D is produced inthis manner (Holick, 2003). Vitamin D 3plays a significant role in calcium homeostasis andbone metabolism, and deficiencies in vitaminD 3have been associated with osteoporosis and osteomalacia as well as numerous other diseases,including cardiovascular disease, multiple scle-rosis, diabetes, and a variety of cancers (Holick,2003).The DermisThe dermis is composed primarily of the con- nective tissue fibers of collagen and elastin.Collagen provides structure to the skin. Due toits flexibility and extreme strength, collagenoffers resistance against pulling forces (Arking,1998) and thus helps protect the skin frombeing torn when stretched. Elastin, woventhroughout collagen, adds resilience and flexi-bility to skin. Elastin is responsible for main-taining skin tension while simultaneouslyallowing skin to stretch to permit necessarymovement of muscles and joints. In addition to its connective tissue structure, the dermis is rich in vasculature. This dense vas-culature allows for the provision of nutrients tothe epidermis and assists in the control of bodytemperature through regulation of blood flow.The dermis also contains an abundance of nervesthat relay information to the brain in responseto a variety of sensory stimuli. Pressure andtouch stimuli are detected and responded to bynerve endings known, respectively, as Pacini'sand Meissner's LayerThe subcutaneous layer is made up of loose collagen and subcutaneous fat. Collagen pro-vides structure to the skin, much as it does inthe dermis. Subcutaneous fat, with its rich vas-culature, acts as an insulator against extensiveheat loss. Thus, this layer of the skin plays anextremely important role in thermoregulation.Fat also serves as a shock absorber to preventinjury and trauma to bone, muscle, and internalorgans. In addition, subcutaneous fat acts as astorage area for caloric reserves. The Aging Skin Changes in skin structure and function can beclassified either as chronological (intrinsic)aging or photoaging. Chronological aging refers to those changes considered to be due onlyto the passage of time ( Table 6-5 ). Photoaging is the result of chronic exposure to UV radia-tion. Chronologically aged skin is characterizedby thinness and a reduction in elasticity. The28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 227 228 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Table 6-5 Chronological or Intrinsic Aging Changes of the Integumentary System Structure Function Consequence Skin Epidermis D 3production Loss of thicknessLoss of collagen elasticityand overall loss of collagenElastin loses resiliencyand more vascularityDecline radiationDampened cell-mediatedimmune Reduced ability skin suppleness Reduced ability to returnskin to normal tensionDecline in blood flow;impairedthermoregulationReduced response topressure and touchImpaired ability to insu-late and protect Increased risk of skincancerSlower wound repairIncreased risk of tumorformation and skincancerReduced ability finemaneuvers and hypothermia;increased risk of injuryand bruising28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 228 The Integumentary System 229 wrinkles caused by chronological aging are usu-ally very fine and thus the skin appears relativelysmooth. In contrast, photoaged skin is charac-terized by deep wrinkles, sagging, and a leath-ery appearance (Scharffetter-Kochanek et al.,2000). Generally, chronological aging and pho-toaging become superimposed upon one anotherand compound each other's effects. However, ascan be seen in Figure 6-24, most all the visible changes in aged skin are the result of photoag-ing. Chronological aging primarily affects skin'sfunction rather than its appearance. With age, there is an overall decrease in the turnover rate of epidermal keratinocytes. By theeighth decade (Fossel, 2004), turnover rate hasdecreased by as much as 50%. The reducedturnover rate slows the exfoliation-replacementrate of dead keratinocytes. As a result, exposureof epidermal cells to harmful carcinogens is pro-longed and the risk of skin cancer increases (M. L. Timiras, 2003). Risk of infection alsoincreases. In addition, decreased epidermalturnover rate contributes to the slower woundrepair seen in elderly persons. The number of active melanocytes also declines with age, at a rate of 10% to 20% perdecade (Fossel, 2004). This decline weakens thebody's protective barrier against UV radiation,resulting in an increased risk of UV-inducedDNA damage. Such damage greatly increasesthe risk of tumor formation and the develop-ment of skin cancer, especially among the el-derly population in which the DNA repair rateis slowed (Yaar & Gilchrest, 2001). With age,the remaining melanocytes generally have fewerpigment granules, making aged skin less likelyto tan (Krauss Whitbourne, 2002). In addition,the melanocytes tend to increase in size andgroup together. This results in the so-called agespots that appear on elderly skin.Table 6-5 Chronological or Intrinsic Aging Changes of the Integumentary System (continued) Structure Function Consequence Skin Derivatives HairNailsEccrine glands Sebaceous glandsThinning and loss;changes in length,appearance, and 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 229 230 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Figure 6-24 Photoaging (a) versus chronological aging (b).

Langerhans cells show an age-associated numerical decline of 20% to 50% from earlyadulthood to late adulthood (Yaar & Gilchrest,2001). As a result, cell-mediated immune re-sponse is dampened with age. In fact, both animaland human studies have found immune systemabnormalities to be associated with defects in thestructure and function of skin cells (Arking,1998). A depressed immune response can increasesusceptibility to skin infection as well as skin aller-gens. In addition, when coupled with the reduc-tion in melanocytes' protective action, theweakened immune response only further increasesolder persons' risk of tumor development. Finally, vitamin D 3production by the epi- dermis declines with age. This is the result ofboth a decrease in epidermal vitamin D 3pre- cursor and a reduction in sun exposure amongolder adults. The lower levels of vitamin D 3put older adults at greater risk for poor overall bonehealth, osteoporosis, and numerous other dis-eases, as mentioned earlier. In young skin, the epidermal and dermal lay- ers are held tightly together through a series of28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 230 The Integumentary System 231 interdigitations called dermal papillae, and it isnearly impossible to separate this epidermal-dermal junction. With age, however, there is aflattening of the epidermal-dermal junction asits interdigitated structure is lost. This flatten-ing of the junction allows the epidermis to moreeasily separate from the underlying dermis. Inturn, this separation renders older persons moresusceptible to bruising and tearing of the skinas well as to blister formation. Furthermore, thedecreased area of surface contact between theepidermis and dermis may compromise com-munication and nutrient transfer between thesetwo layers of the skin (Yaar & Gilchrest, 2001).The rate of change in the epidermal-dermaljunction differs among women and men. Inwomen, changes occur rather sharply between40 and 60 years of age, most likely as a resultof hormonal changes with menopause. Amongmen, the rate of change is much more constantthroughout adulthood (Yaar & Gilchrest, 2001). The greatest changes in aging skin are seen in the dermis. There is a general thinning of the der-mal layer with loss of thickness averaging 20%in older persons (Beers & Berkow, 2000). Thisthinning of the dermis is due in large part to ageneral loss of collagen\u2014approximately a 1%loss per year in adulthood (M. L. Timiras,2003)\u2014as well as a decrease in its flexibility. Inaddition, elastin becomes increasingly brittle andless resilient. This change in elastin results in aloss of its ability to return to its original tensionafter it is stretched by the movement of underly-ing muscles and joints. Consequently, skin ismore likely to sag. The overall effect of thesechanges in the connective tissues of the dermis isthe looseness, loss of suppleness, and increasedfine wrinkling that is characteristic of old,chronologically aged skin. It is of interest to notethat the dermal layer is generally thicker in malesthan females, and this may account for the appar-ently greater rate of deterioration of female skin,especially following menopause (Arking, 1998). With age the dermis also undergoes a decline in vascularity, and blood flow is reduced byapproximately 60% (Beers & Berkow, 2000).This reduction results in a decrease in skin tem-perature, making the skin of older adults gener-ally cool to the touch. Diminished vascularityalso contributes to impaired thermoregulation.The avascularity characterizing older skin cangive a paler appearance to the skin, and generallythe bones and remaining blood vessels beneaththe skin become more visually prominent. Nerve endings in the dermis also undergo changes as a person ages. In particular, the num-ber of Pacini's and Meissner's corpuscles decreases,leading to a decline in the sensations of pressureand touch. Consequently, older persons are moreprone to injuries resulting from poor detection ofsensory stimuli. In addition, sensory loss leads toa decline in the ability to perform fine maneuverswith the hands. The skin's subcutaneous layer thins dramati- cally with age. This loss of thickness occurs pri-marily in the skin of the face and hands (Arking,1998). There is a general redistribution of bodyfat to the intra-abdominal region with age. Thus,skin around the hips and abdomen and subcu-taneous thickness may, in fact, increase in theseareas (Fenske & Lober, 1986). The subcutaneouslayer ordinarily acts as an insulator against exces-sive loss of body heat. Thus, as it thins, the abil-ity to conserve heat declines, making the olderperson more prone to low body temperature andpossible hypothermia when exposed to the cold(Krauss Whitbourne, 2002). The thinning of thesubcutaneous layer also limits its ability to act asa protective cushioning. Consequently, bones,major organs, arteries, and nerves receive moreconcentrated impacts (Fossel, 2004), in turn in-creasing the risk of injury and bruising. 28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 231 232 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Estrogen and Aging Skin Sex hormones greatly influence the aging process,and the skin is a target organ for these hormones.Therefore, a change in sex hormone levels withage will affect any skin functions that are underhormonal control (Sator, Schmidt, Rabe, &Zouboulis, 2004). Estrogen is a sex hormone andhas been extensively studied for its influence onskin aging. Research has shown that the reductionin estrogen associated with menopause is associ-ated with impaired structure and function of theskin (Phillips, Demircay, & Sahu, 2001; Shah receiv-ing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) havebeen shown to have thicker, healthier skin.Women on HRT show statistically greatercollagen content than those not receiving HRT(Phillips et al., 2001). In addition, the skin ofthose receiving hormonal treatment exhibits lessloss of elasticity, in turn exerting a positive effecton skin sagging (Pierard, Letawe, Dowlati, &Pierard-Franchimont, 1995). One national studyfound that estrogen may prevent both skindrying and skin wrinkling (Dunn, Damesyn,Moore, Reuben, & Greendale, 1997). Aging of Skin Derivatives HairHair is produced by hair follicles underneath thesurface of the skin. With age, the germinationcenters that produce hair follicles undergo changesand may, in fact, be destroyed (Krauss Whit-bourne, 2002). As a result, thinning and loss ofscalp hair occurs with age, in both men andwomen. There may also be a thinning of facial hairin men. Simultaneously, however, the hair onolder men's eyebrows and inside their ears maybecome longer and coarser. Similarly, women maydevelop unwanted facial hair, especially followingthe hormonal changes associated with menopause.Hair also tends to gray over time. Graying is due primarily to gradual loss of functionalmelanocytes from hair bulbs and a general declinein melanin production. The age of onset of gray-ing varies somewhat based on heredity and racialbackground. For Caucasians, the average age ofgraying onset is the mid-30s, for Asians late-30s,and for African Americans mid-40s. Despitethese variations, however, it can generally be saidthat by 50 years of age 50% of people have 50%gray hair (Tobin & Paus, 2001).NailsThe linear growth rate of nails decreases withage (M. L. Timiras, 2003). In addition, nailstend to become thinner, drier, and more brit-tle as a person ages. Nails also undergo a changein shape, generally become flat or concaveinstead of convex (Beers & Berkow, 2000).Longitudinal grooves or ridges also formon the nails.GlandsBoth eccrine glands and sebaceous glandsundergo changes with age. The number ofeccrine glands decreases by approximately 15%during adulthood (Beers & Berkow, 2000). Inaddition, the glands' efficiency declines and lesssweat is produced. The result is impaired ther-moregulation and difficulty in staying cool.This leaves older adults at greater risk for heatexhaustion and heat stroke. Sebaceous glands do not decrease in number with age; however, the size of the glands decreaseswith age as does glandular activity. Soon afterpuberty, oil production declines at a rate of 23%per decade in men and 32% per decade in women(Jacobsen et al., 1985). Clinical manifestationsassociated with age-related changes of the seba-ceous glands include increased dryness, rough-ness, and itchiness of the skin as well as, in rare28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 232 The Immune System 233 cases, sebaceous gland carcinoma (Zouboulis &Boschnakow, 2001). The Immune System The immune system is a network of cells and bio-chemicals responsible for defending the bodyagainst foreign microorganisms such as bacteria,viruses, fungi, and parasites. Whenever theimmune system is compromised, the body is leftvulnerable to a variety of infections and infectiousdiseases, from the flu and common cold to tuber-culosis and AIDS. The numerous and, at times,life-threatening consequences of a weakenedimmune system illustrate the tremendous impor-tance of the system in maintaining good health. The crucial feature of the immune system that makes it such a remarkable system of defense isits ability to distinguish the body's own cells(\"self\") from any foreign cells or microorganisms(\"nonself\"). Any foreign substance invading thebody is known as an antigen . Antigens carry marker molecules on their surface that identifythem as foreign. It is these marker moleculesthat allow for the discernment of self and non-self. In cases where this discernment process fails,the immune system will attack its own cells.This attack of self is termed autoimmunity and can lead to a variety of autoimmune diseases,such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple scle-rosis. Once again, these consequences of a dis-rupted immune system demonstrate its criticalrole in protecting the health of an organism. The defense mechanisms of the immune sys- tem are divided into two primary types, innate (or nonspecific) immunity and acquired (also called specific or adaptive) immunity . Each type of immunity is characterized by its owncomponents and method of function. However,the two must work in close collaboration, oftenthrough the use of cytokines , to fulfill theircommon responsibility\u2014the protection of thebody against infection and disease. Innate Immunity The innate immune system is the one withwhich a person is born. It is always present andis activated almost immediately upon exposureto an antigen. It is the body's initial attempt atridding the body of foreign substances.Although innate immunity allows for the gen-eral discernment of self vs. nonself, it does nothave the ability to recognize a specific antigen. Thus, even if the body is repeatedly exposed tothe same antigen, the body will react each timeto that particular antigen as if it had neverbefore been encountered. Innate immunity doesnot adapt to or remember a specific antigen.Consequently, it is unable to improve the effec-tiveness of its defense against that antigen. Innateimmunity, therefore, is antigen-independent andresults in no immunologic memory of priorencounters with an antigen. Innate immunity operates through a variety of mechanisms. One of these mechanisms in-volves the use of physical barriers, in particularthe skin and mucosal membranes. The skin maybe the most basic and yet one of the mostimportant mechanisms of immunity, because itis the first site most antigens encounter and thesite at which many are stopped. Mucosal mem-branes, such as those lining the eyes, airways,and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts,also provide physical barriers of protection. Sotoo do mucosal secretions, such as saliva andtears, which contain enzymes that destroy po-tential infectious agents. If an antigen manages to breach physical bar- riers such as skin and mucosa, the innate immunesystem continues its attack on the antigen bylaunching additional defense mechanisms. Theseinclude the actions of macrophages , natural28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 233 234 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems killer (NK) cells , and the complement system as well as the inflammatory response . Macrophages act through a process called phagocytosis. During phagocytosis an antigen iscompletely engulfed and, through the use ofdestructive enzymes, literally consumed by themacrophage. Macrophages also secrete cytokinesthat stimulate the actions of NK cells. When NKcells are activated, they work to kill cells thathave been altered through infection by an anti-gen. Destruction of these cells occurs throughtwo mechanisms. First, NK cells literally punchholes in the membranes of the altered cells andrelease enzymes that promote self-induced death(or apoptosis) of the altered cells. Second, NKcells release cytokines that target macrophagesand enhance their destructive action. Thus,macrophages and NK cells work synergisticallyto augment each other's actions and thereby pro-vide a stronger defense against invading antigens. The complement system is a collection of proteins that can kill antigens directly or helpto destroy antigens by attaching to and markingthem for destruction by macrophages and othercells of the immune system. The complementsystem also initiates the inflammatory response,which results in the release of several chemicalmessengers that signal macrophages and otherphagocytic cells to destroy the antigen. Thesechemical messengers also increase blood flowand cause blood vessels to release fluid, result-ing in redness and swelling, respectively, at thesite of invasion. The swelling helps to isolate anantigen and prevent if from coming in furthercontact with body tissues. The inflammatoryresponse also generates heat, and thus fever, inan attempt to overheat and kill antigens. Innate immunity provides an early and strong line of defense against foreign antigens.In addition, the very occurrence of the innateimmune response serves as a signal for initiationof the acquired immune response, effectivelystimulating further mechanisms of defense.When they act in concert, innate and acquiredimmunity provide the body with its most pow-erful protection against infection and disease. Acquired Immunity Acquired immunity consists of two branches(Table 6-6 ). The first, humoral immunity , is mediated by antigen-attacking proteins calledantibodies and is responsible for defending the body against extracellular antigens foundin the blood and other body fluids or \"hu-mors.\" The second branch, cell-mediated immunity , is responsible for destroying in- tracellular antigens. Acquired immunity in-volves the actions of two primary types ofleukocytes\u2014 B cells and T cells . Both cell types are produced in the bone marrow; how-ever, only B cells continue to mature in themarrow. T cells are transported to the thymus,a small organ behind the breast bone, for mat-uration. Once both cell types have reached ma-turity they reside mainly in the lymph nodesand spleen. B cells are involved primarily inhumoral immunity and T cells principally in cell-mediated immunity. However, there isstrong communication between the two celltypes, reflecting the collaborative action of thetwo branches of acquired immunity.Humoral ImmunityB cells are activated through encounters withantigens. However, not any antigen will acti-vate any B cell. Each B cell is programmed torespond to only one specific antigen. Onceactivated by this antigen, the B cells undergoa process known as clonal expansion in which they multiply to produce a multitude of B cellclones. These clones then differentiate intoantibody-producing B cells, or plasma cells28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 234 The Immune System 235 (Figure 6-25 ). Plasma cells are capable of pro- ducing and secreting antibodies against onlythe specific antigen that initiated the humoralimmune response. The antibodies are releasedinto the bloodstream where they bind with thetargeted antigen. This binding action neutral-izes the antigen and prompts other immunecells, such as macrophages, into action. Following clonal expansion, not all B cell clones will differentiate into antibody-producingcells. Some will become memory B cells. Uponformation, these memory cells do not produceantibodies; however, they effectively rememberthe antigen against which they were producedand retain the ability to produce antibodies inthe future should the antigen be reintroduced.The memory cells survive, perhaps for years, andcirculate in the bloodstream, primed to launcha rapid response if and when they again en-counter their antigen. Thus, humoral immunityis characterized by immunologic cells are types\u2014 T-helper cells , killer T cells , and suppressor T cells (Table 6-7 ). T-helper cells are the primary regulatory agents ofthe immune system. They identify foreign anti-gens and, in response, proliferate through clonalexpansion and release chemical messengers thatstimulate action of the killer T cells. T-helper cellsalso have an indirect role in humoral immunity.Only nonprotein antigens have the ability to causedirect activation of B cells. Protein antigensrequire that B cells first interact with and receivechemical signals from T-helper cells before the Bcells can be activated and an antibody-mediatedhumoral response launched. This T-helper cellactivation of the B cells provides an excellentexample of the interaction between humoral andcell-mediated immunity. Killer T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells, directly attack and destroy infected cellswithin the body. Most commonly killer T cellsoperate against virally infected cells; however,they are also responsible for ridding the body ofcells that have been transformed by cancer. Inaddition, killer T cells are the cells responsiblefor the rejection of organ and tissue grafts. Suppressor T cells are the final players in an immune response. These cells counteract theactions of T-helper and killer T cells as well asB cells, bringing an end to the immune responseTable 6-6 Comparison of Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immunity HumoralPrincipal cellular agent is the B cell.B cell responds to bacteria, bacterial toxins, and some viruses.When activated, B cells form memory cells and plasma cells, which produce antibodies to these antigens.Cell-MediatedPrincipal cellular agent is the T cell.T cell responds to cancer cells, virus-infected cells, single-cell fungi, parasites, and foreign cells in an organ transplant.When activated, T cells differentiate into memory cells, cytotoxic cells, suppressor cells, and helper cells; cytotoxic T cells attack the antigen directly.

In addition, sup-pressor T cells act to dampen the immuneresponse when it becomes overactive. Thisdampening action is crucial given that overac-tion of the immune response can lead to bothallergic reactions and autoimmune disease.Thus, the action of suppressor T cells is criticalto ensuring that the overall immune responseremains properly balanced. Like humoral immunity, cell-mediated immu- nity is characterized by immunologic memory.During proliferation T cells produce a pool ofmemory cells. These cells remain dormant untilthey again come in contact with the antigen theyremember; they then unleash a faster and morepowerful immune response than the first. Somememory cells are able to survive for the lifetimeof an individual. This ability is what provides uswith lifelong immunity to diseases such aschicken pox and measles. Immunosenescence Immunosenescence refers to the aging of the immune system, and to date the aging processis thought to involve primarily the T cells of theimmune system. B cells are less highly affectedby immunosenescence.Thymus InvolutionThe prominent morphological of The thymusbegins to atrophy around puberty and continuesas an individual ages. Extrapolating fromknown rates of thymic involution, it has beenpostulated that if an individual were to live to120 years of age, the thymus would atrophycompletely (Aspinall & Andrew, 2000). Giventhat the thymus is responsible for T cell matu-ration and differentiation, it is not surprisingthat the involution of this organ results inchanges in the T cell population. Na\u00efve/Memory T Cell RatioAt any given time, both na\u00efve and memory Tcells are present in the body. Na\u00efve T cells arethose that have not yet been exposed to an anti-gen; these are the cells that respond to any newTable 6-7 Summary of T-Cells Cell Type ActionCytotoxic T cells Destroy body cells infected by viruses, and attack and kill bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer cells Helper Produce a growth factor that stimulates T cells B-cell proliferation and differentiation and also stimulates antibody production by plasma cells; enhanceactivity of cytotoxic T cells Suppressor May inhibit immune reaction by T cells decreasing B- and T-cell activity and B- and T-cell division Memory Remain in body awaiting reintroduction T cells of antigen, at which time they proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, and additional memory cells Source: Daniel D.

Memory Tcells, as discussed earlier, are T cells that are pro-grammed to respond to specific and previouslyencountered antigens. With age there is a shiftin the ratio of na\u00efve T cells to memory T cells.In young persons, this ratio is quite high. Overtime, however, many more na\u00efve cells becomeexposed to antigens and converted to memory Tcells. In addition, as a result of thymic involu-tion, fewer na\u00efve T cells are produced with age.As a result of these changes, the population ofna\u00efve T cells is depleted over time. Therefore,the ratio of na\u00efve T cells to memory T cells isvery low in older persons. Consequently, elderlypersons respond much less efficiently to newantigens that may threaten the body (Linton &Korshkind, 2004; Whitman, 1999), leavingthem more vulnerable to infection and disease.Replicative SenescenceThe greater the number of B or T cells availableto fight off infection and disease, the more likelyit is that the immune response will be effective.Thus, the replication or proliferation of immunecells subsequent to stimulation by an antigen iscrucial to efficient immune function. However,cells can undergo only a finite number of divi-sions, after which there can be no further prolif-eration of cells. This phenomenon is known asreplicative senescence . Replicative senescence is the result not of the passage of time per se, butof repeated cell division (Effros & Pawelec,1997). Nonetheless, over time older cells willhave experienced more demands for cell divisionthan younger cells. Consequently, older cells aremore likely to have exhausted their ability todivide and to have reached a state of replicativesenescence. This is particularly true of immunecells that repeatedly encounter their antigens(Effros, Dagarag, & Valenzuela, 2003) (e.g., anti-gens giving rise to the common cold). In addi-tion to the increased number of cells that reachreplicative senescence as a person ages, researchhas also shown that replicative senescence occursearlier (i.e., after fewer divisions) in T cells fromold individuals. This suggests that T cells mayhave a reduced ability to proliferate in old age(Wick & Grubeck-Loebenstein, 1997). The primary result of replicative senescence is a decline in the overall number of immunecells available to ward off invading antigens. Inaddition, if immune cells reach replicativesenescence during an active immune response,they will be unable to continue cell division,thereby leading to premature termination of theimmune response (Effros & Pawelec, 1997).Thus, with age the immune response is greatlyweakened due to the inability of immune cellsto divide indefinitely. Replicative senescenceappears to be of particular concern T cellsand cell-mediated immunity.Cell SignalingEffective cell-mediated immunity requires thatwhen a T cell binds to its antigen, the presence ofthat antigen must be communicated or signaledto the interior of the cell. One of the key mole-cules involved in this signaling process is CD28,located on the surface of T cells. Without thepresence of CD28, the cell is unable to respond toan invading antigen and thus remains inactive.With age, there is a progressive increase in thenumber of T cells lacking CD28. Consequently,there is increased likelihood of disruption to thesignaling pathway and, ultimately, T cell func-tion is impaired (Hirokawa, 1999). Calcium, essential for numerous biochemical reactions, is also crucial for effective cell signaling.In general, calcium deficiency becomes morelikely as a person ages. This deficiency contributesto impaired cell signaling within the immune sys-tem of older persons. Calcium is also a central28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 238 The Hematopoietic System 239 player in the production of cytokines. Thus, cal-cium deficiency can inhibit production of thesechemical messengers, thereby hindering immunesystem communication and the overall coordina-tion of the immune response (Whitman, 1999). AutoimmunityDespite the age-related decrease in immuneresponse to foreign antigens, there is an increasein autoimmunity. There is an overall increase inthe percentage of T cells and B cell-generatedantibodies that are directed against many of thebody's own cells. The reason for the increase inautoimmunity is not well understood. However,it has been hypothesized that although T cellsdirected against the body's own cells are nor-mally destroyed in the thymus before they arefully matured, involution of the thymus withage allows these cells to persist. In turn these Tcells could also prompt B cells to produceautoantibodies\u2014antibodies against the body'sown cells. Ultimately, there is an increase inautoimmunity. Clinical Implications ofImmunosenescence V accinationsDue to changes characterizing immunosenes-cence, older individuals are more susceptible toinfection and disease than are younger individ-uals. One method by which to strengthen theimmune defenses is to administer vaccines suchas those against influenza and pneumonia. Byintroducing the body to a foreign antigen, vac-cines stimulate the production of antibody-producing B cells as well as memory T cellsagainst the antigen. However, older individu-als' antibody response to vaccines is slower andweaker than that seen in younger individuals(Whitman, 1999). In addition, due to the de-crease in na\u00efve T cells with age, the T cell re-sponse of older persons to a new antigen, suchas that introduced by vaccine, may be particu-larly impaired (Wick & Grubeck-Loebenstein,1997). T cells of older adults have, in fact, beenshown to respond less quickly to vaccines.Overall, the age-related changes in response tovaccines generally render them less effective inolder patients.Infection and DiseaseImmunosenescence is associated with increasedincidence of infectious disease such as bronchitisand influenza. It is also implicated in the increasedincidence of tumors and cancer that occurs withage. In addition, immunosenescence has beenassociated with a number of age-related autoim-mune diseases and inflammatory reactions,including diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, car-diovascular disease, and dementia. Inarguably, theaging of the immune system has widespreadimplications for disease incidence and overallhealth within the elderly population. The Hematopoietic System The hematopoietic system is responsible for theproduction, differentiation, and proliferation ofmature blood cells from stem cells. The site of blood cell production, or hematopoiesis , changes with the developmental stage of an organism. In the fetus, blood cells are producedin the liver, spleen, and yolk sac. In childrenand adults, blood cells are produced in the bonemarrow. At birth, the cavities of nearly allbones are filled with active bone marrow; how-ever, by adulthood active bone marrow is foundonly in the femur, humerus, sternum, vertebrae,and ribs as well as the pelvic bones and someskull bones.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 239 240 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Hematopoiesis Hematopoiesis begins with pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent describes the cells' ability to differentiate into any of several different types ofprogeny cells, or stem cell progenitors . Each type of progenitor is committed to the produc-tion of only one particular type of mature bloodcell (e.g., red blood cells, white blood cells,platelets, as discussed below). (See Table 6-8. ) Pluripotent stem cells and stem cell progenitorscomprise the body's stem cell pool. The stemcells are capable of self-renewal and thus, thestem cell pool is maintained throughout an indi-vidual's life. The self-renewal capacity of stemcells together with the unlimited differentiationpotential of pluripotent stem cells allows forregeneration of all hematopoietic cells as needed. Hematopoiesis is regulated by a network of several biochemical messengers known as cy-tokines. Any imbalance in cytokine productionor decreased sensitivity to cytokines by pluripo-tent stem cells and/or stem cell progenitors canresult in disruption of hematopoiesis. Likewise,disruption may result from a reduction in thenumber of pluripotent stem cells available for dif-ferentiation into mature blood cells. The hema-topoietic system is responsible for a variety offunctions, including oxygen delivery to cells, theimmune response, and hemostasis, or the controlof blood loss. Given the importance of these func-tions, any interruption to hematopoiesis will havepotentially serious consequences for efficient andproper functioning of the body. The Blood Cells ErythrocytesErythrocytes (Table 6-8), or red blood cells, are biconcave in shape and have no nuclei. They arered in color due to the presence of hemoglobin,an iron-containing protein pigment. Eryth-rocytes are responsible for the transport of oxy-gen, which binds to hemoglobin molecules andis then carried from the lungs to the cells whereit is needed for metabolism. The efficient deliv-ery of oxygen is a key function of erythrocytes,and the production and functional activity oferythrocytes increases in response to hypoxia, oroxygen deprivation. Once produced in the bone marrow, erythro- cytes mature in 24 to 48 hours. They have a life-span of approximately 120 days, after which theydie and are removed from circulation. Erythro-cytes, however, have the capacity for continualself-renewal, allowing for the replenishment of thered blood cell supply. This replenishment balancesthe routine destruction of erythrocytes and, thus,a relatively constant number of red blood cells ismaintained in the circulation. LeukocytesLeukocytes (Table 6-8), or white blood cells, are classified on the basis of their nuclear shape as wellas the presence or absence of cytoplasmic granules.Leukocytes are of two primary types, granular andagranular, and function principally within theimmune system. Granular leukocytes, and Basophils and eosinophilsare involved in inflammatory reactions. Agranularleukocytes, also termed leukocytes,consist lymphocytes and monocytes. The T-lympho-cytes, which involved in humoral andcell-mediated immunity, respectively. (See \"TheImmune System\" earlier in this chapter.)Monocytes are also involved in the immune response. These cells leave the blood and enter tis-sues where they mature into macrophages, cellsnecessary for the destruction of infectious agents.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 240 The Hematopoietic System 241Table 6-8 Summary of Blood Cells Source: Daniel D.

Hemostasis involves the aggregationof thrombocytes to form a clot. The clot then actsto seal off and impede blood loss from wounds. Aging of the HematopoieticSystem Changes that are most often discussed in regardto the aging hematopoietic system include thereduced proliferative and self-replicative capac-ity of stem cells and changes in the cytokine net-work. However, the degree to which thesechanges are the result of aging per se remainscontroversial. There is a great deal of evidence tosuggest that functioning of the hematopoieticsystem, when under basal or steady-state condi-tions, undergoes no significant changes withaging. Many of the changes in the hematopoieticsystem of older individuals are evidenced onlyunder circumstances, such as hemorrhaging oranemia, in which the system is under stress andexperiencing an increase in functional demand.Stem Cells and Aging The Proliferative Capacity of Stem Cells. Some research suggests that stem cells' prolifera-tive capacity is limited and may decrease with age,reaching a state of exhaustion (Globerson, 1999).As discussed in Chapter 3, reduction in prolifera-tive capacity is thought to result from continualshortening of telomeres, the terminal sections ofchromosomes. Once telomeres become too shortto allow for further cell replication, cell prolifera-tion ceases. If and when stem cell proliferation isstopped, the body becomes limited in its abilityto renew the supply of mature hematopoietic cells.A reduction in mature hematopoietic cells wouldin turn affect the efficiency with which these cellsperform their respective functions, such as oxygendelivery and the immune response. Telomerase is the enzyme that stimulates the addition of telomeric portions to the end of chro-mosomes, thereby maintaining the self-renewalcapacity of cells. Telomerase activity is upregu-lated in response to chemical messages fromcytokines and down-regulated in response to cellproliferation. Although the action of telomerasemay act to limit telomere shortening and subse-quent reductions in proliferative capacity, it hasnot been shown to entirely prevent reduction intelomere length (Engelhardt et al., 1997). Thus,potential methods by which telomerase activityis increased will not lead to a cessation of the lossof proliferative capacity. Furthermore, researchhas suggested that indeed other factors besidesthe action of telomerase are involved in regula-tion of telomere shortening (Lansdorp et al.,1997). Thus, certainly the mechanisms influenc-ing loss of proliferative capacity with age have yetto be clarified and will require further research. As mentioned earlier, many of the age-related changes in the hematopoietic system are mostevident not when the body is in the basal statebut when the body is under hematopoieticstress. Hematopoietic stress requires a fairlyrapid increase in the number of functional bloodcells, thereby necessitating an efficient processof stem cell proliferation. Hence, the reductionof stem cell proliferative capacity illustrates wellhow age-related changes would be most clearlyevident under conditions of stress. CD34 /H11001Progenitor Stem Cells. CD34/H11001 cells, the primary circulating progenitor stem cells, are believed to decrease in number with age.This decrease is evidenced by one study, whichfound that among normal human volunteers(ages 20-90 years) CD34 /H11001cells exhibited an28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 242 The Hematopoietic System 243 inverse correlation with age (Egusa, Fujiwara,Syahruddin, Isobe, & Yamakido, 1998). Thedecline in CD34 /H11001cells witnessed among older adults ages 66-73 years was similar to that wit-nessed in centenarians. This research suggeststhat reduction in CD34 /H11001cell counts is primarily an early age-related phenomenon. Centenariansand those with great longevity are unlikely toexhibit further decreases in CD34 /H11001progenitor cells than that which they experienced in theearly stages of aging (Bagnara et al., 2000).Age-Related Changes in the CytokineNetworkCytokines involved in the regulation ofhematopoiesis include interleukin 3 (IL-3), gran-ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 2000;Baraldi-Junkins, & Rothstein, 2000).These cytokines show changes in older popula-tions, which may implicate them in many of theage-related changes in the hematopoietic system. The peripheral blood of older individuals is reported to have a reduced capacity to produce IL-3 and GM-CSF (Bagnara et al., 2000), therebylimiting their efficiency in stimulating the pro-duction of hematopoietic cells. IL-6 and TNF- /H9251, in contrast, show an increased concentration withage in both animals and humans (Balducci et al.,2000). This increase has the potential to disrupthomeostatic regulation of hematopoiesis and maybe partially responsible for poor response to hem-atopoietic stress with age. Furthermore, increasedIL-6 concentrations show an association withincreased risk of death, anemia, and functionaldecline in older persons (Balducci et al., 2003). Anemia and Aging Anemia is a condition in which a deficiency in the number of erythrocytes or the amount ofhemoglobin they contain limits the exchange ofoxygen and carbon dioxide between the bloodand tissues. Anemia is a common conditionamong older persons. Eight percent to 44% ofthe elderly population suffers from anemia, witha higher prevalence among older men (Nilsson-Ehle, Jagenburg, Landahl, & Svanborg, 2000).These prevalence statistics are based theWorld Health Organization's (WHO) criteriafor a diagnosis of anemia\u2014hemoglobin less than12 g/dl blood in women and less than 13 g/dlblood in men (De Martinis & Timiras, 2003). Despite the relative ubiquitous nature of ane- mia among elderly persons, it is important tonote that most forms of anemia in this popula-tion are due to causes other than aging. This isdemonstrated by the fact that hemoglobin andhematocrit remain essentially unchanged amonghealthy older persons. In addition, when anemiais diagnosed in older adults there is almostalways another comorbid medical conditionpresent and underlying the anemia (De Martinis& Timiras, 2003). Thus, anemia should not beconsidered an age-related disease; it is not a uni-versal or even usual condition that develops asthe body ages.28438_CH06_141_264.qxd 6/7/06 4:12 PM Page 243 244 Chapter 6: Review of the Aging of Physiological Systems Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Choose an age-related disease in which you have a particular interest and then discuss how this disease might impact the functional ability, independence, and psychosocialwell-being of an older adult. 2. Many people within and outside the field of geriatrics and gerontology use the term normal aging to refer to physiological changes that occur over the passage of time. Do you believe there is such a thing a \"normal aging\"? Why or why not? How do you believethe use of the term normal aging might impact the clinical care received by older adults? 3.

Guse, PhD, RN LEARNING OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the reader will be able to:1. Identify the major components of comprehensive assessment of older adults including functional, physical, cognitive, psychological, social, and spiritualassessments. 2. Name some major tools that are frequently used in geriatric assessment.3. Recognize some of the challenges of conducting comprehensive assessments of older adults. 4. Discuss the role of other health professionals in the assessment of older adults. 5. Describe some of the issues in relation to comprehensive assessment of older adults. KEY TERMS Agnosia Aphasia Page 265 266 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult The basis of an individualized plan of care for anolder adult is a comprehensive assessment. En-hanced skills in comprehensive geriatric assess-ment can improve health outcomes, increasenursing assessment confidence, and provide arole model for health care teams (Stolee et al.,2003). Assessment has been described as thecornerstone of gerontological nursing, and thegoal is to conduct a systematic and integratedassessment (Olenek, Skowronski, & Schmaltz,2003). The health and health care needs of olderadults are complex, deriving from a combinationof age-related changes, age-associated diseases,heredity, and lifestyle. Assessment requiresknowledge and an understanding of this com-plexity of factors. In assessing and providingcare to older adults, nurses are members of ahealth care team that includes physicians, ther-apists, social workers, spiritual care workers,pharmacists, nutritionists, and others. Eachmember of the team has a contribution to make,and nurses are often in a position to draw uponthe knowledge of other team members toenhance the assessment process. Comprehensive assessments can be lengthy, and this presents a challenge to nurses becausedepending on health status and energy level,the older adult may not be well or strongenough for an extensive physical or verbal-based assessment. If the older adult is experi-encing memory problems, the reliability ofquestion-based assessment may be suspect. Therole of the family and particularly family care-givers (often spouses and adult children) addsanother dimension. The literature suggeststhat when family members act as proxies forhealth information, there can be underesti-mates and overestimates of functional ability,cognition, and social functioning (Ostbye,Tyas, McDowell, & Koval, 1997). Assessmenttools do not always identify the source of infor-mation, and even experienced nurses sometimesrely too much on secondary sources such asfamily members and caregivers rather than fo-cusing on the older adult as the primary sourceof information (Luborsky, 1997). Since the early 1960s when major tools to measure function were introduced, the numberof assessment tools from which nurses can choosehas increased exponentially. Part of this increasehas been due to the refinement of existing toolsand the testing and tailoring of tools across clientpopulations, as well as the creation of new tools.The current growth in the development of clin-ical practice guidelines has not yet reached thestage where nurses have identified a roster of the\"best\" tools (see www.geronurseonline.com forexamples) to use with older adults across all set-tings for specific areas of assessment. However,certain tools are used by nurses because theyhave been used traditionally to provide a foun-dation for decision making and interventionstrategies. In this chapter, we will identify thesecommon tools and provide guidelines for as-sessment. In addition, several of the chapters inthis text give examples of assessment tools re-lated to specific content. A cautionary note is needed. Comprehensive assessment is not a neutral process; the sourcesof information and tools used as well as the nurse'sskill level have consequences for the older adult'sindividualized plan of care. The physical andsocial environment can support or suppress anolder adult's abilities. Comprehensive assessmentconsists of objective and subjective elements,and how the assessment data are interpreted isof major importance. As Kane (1993) has sug-gested, interpretation is an art, and it is an artthat nurses must aspire to master both as stu-dents and as practitioners. 28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 266 Functional Assessment 267 Functional Assessment Nurses typically conduct a functional assess-ment in order to identify an older adult's abilityto perform self-care, self-maintenance, andphysical activities, and plan appropriate nursinginterventions. There are two approaches. Oneapproach is to ask questions about ability andthe other approach is to observe ability throughevaluating task completion. However, althoughwe tend to speak of \"ability,\" our verbal andobservational tools tend to screen for \"disabil-ity.\" Disability refers to the impact that healthproblems have on an individual's ability to per-form tasks, roles, and activities, and it is oftenmeasured by asking questions about the per-formance of activities of daily living (such as eat-ing and dressing) and instrumental activities ofdaily living (such as meal preparation and hob-bies) (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994). The basis ofour understanding of ability, disability, physicalfunction, activities of daily living, and any con-textual factors comes from work initiated by theWorld Health Organization (WHO) more than25 years ago. The International Classification of Impair- ment, Disability and Handicap (ICIDH) wasfirst published by the WHO in 1980. It sug-gested relationships among impairment, disabil-ity, and handicap as illustrated by definitionsprovided in Box 7-1 . In attempting to move away from a disease and toward a health per-spective, the WHO made definitional changesand created a new International Classification ofFunctioning, Disability and Health (ICIDH-2)in 2001. The ICIDH-2 uses the term disability to reflect limitations in activities based on aninteraction between the individual's health(including impairment, or problems in bodyfunction or structure) and the physical, social, and attitudinal environment. The term handicap has been discontinued and, instead, participation restriction is used. Kearney and Pryor (2004) have suggested that nursing has not yet integratedthe ICIDH-2 framework into research, practice,and education. Specifically, they suggest thatthe ICIDH-2 framework provides nurses witha broad structure \"to address more fully, activ-ity limitations and participation restrictionsassociated with impairment\" (2004, p. 166).Moreover, they argue that in nursing education,students should be encouraged to develop \"ahealth care plan that outlines strategies to pro-mote maximum health, function, well-being,independence and participation in life for theindividual\" (2004, p. 167). Kearney and Pryor(2004) are, in fact, promoting an \"ability\" per-spective, but it is broadly stated and does notfocus specifically on older adults.Box 7-1 WHO (1980) ICIDH Classification Impairment: Any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, oranatomical structure or function. Disability: Any restriction or lack (result- ing from impairment) of ability to per-form an activity in the manner orwithin the range considered normal fora human being. Handicap: A disadvantage for a given individual, resulting from impairmentor disability that limits or prevents thefulfillment of a role that is normal(depending on age, sex, and social andcultural factors) for that individual.28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 267 268 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult Taking an \"ability\" perspective on compre- hensive assessment of older adults builds uponthe ICIDH-2 framework and is informed by thework of Kearney and Pryor (2004) and others.Functional assessment should first emphasize anolder adult's ability and the appropriate nursinginterventions to support, maintain, and maxi-mize ability; second, it should focus on an olderadult's disability and the appropriate nursinginterventions to compensate for and prevent fur-ther disability. Nursing interventions that cre-ate excess disability are not appropriate. Excessdisability is defined as \"functional disabilitygreater than that warranted by actual physicaland physiological impairment of the individual\"(Kahn, 1964, p. 112). For example, assisting anolder adult in a nursing home to get dressed inthe morning when that individual is mentallyand physically able to do this task creates excessdisability or disability where it does not exist. Tools to assess functional ability tend to address self-care (basic activities of daily livingor ADLs), higher level activities necessary to liveindependently in the community (instrumentalactivities of daily living or IADLs), or highestlevel activities (advanced activities of daily liv-ing or AADLs) (Adnan, Chang, Arseven, &Emanuel, 2005). Advanced activities of dailyliving include societal, family, and communityroles, as well as participation in occupationaland recreational activities. In selecting or usingtools to measure functional ability, the nursemust be clear on two questions. First, is per-formance or capacity being assessed? Some toolsask, \"Do you dress without help?\" (performance)whereas others ask, \"Can you dress withouthelp?\" (capacity). Asking about capacity willresult in answers that emphasize ability. Thesecond question is, who is the source of infor-mation on functional ability? Is informationgained verbally from the family or from theolder adult? Does the nurse assess functionalability by direct observation or by relying on theobservations of others? In 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconcili- ation Act (OBRA) mandated the use of theMinimum Data Set (MDS) in all Medicaid- andMedicare-funded nursing homes. This assess-ment tool attempted to identify a resident'sstrengths, preferences, and functional abilitiesin a systematic way in order to better address hisor her needs. The MDS was revised in 1995 anda home-based version was also later developed.In this chapter, we will not be looking at thisassessment tool. Instead, examples of tools toassess functional ability will be presented inrelation to ADL, IADL, and AADL. In addition,the use of physical performance measures will bediscussed relative to functional assessment. Activities of Daily Living(ADLs) The original ADL tool was developed by Katzand colleagues during an 8-year period at theBenjamin Rose Hospital, a geriatric hospital inCleveland, Ohio, using observations of patientswith hip fractures and their performance of ac-tivities during recovery (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz,Jackson, & Jaffee, 1963). The Katz Index ofADL (1970) distinguished between indepen-dence and dependence in activities and createdan ordered relationship among ADLs. It ad-dressed the need for assistance in bathing, eat-ing, dressing, transfer, toileting, and continence.Other similar tools followed the Katz Index ofADL and are still being developed. Tools can bedivided into those that are generic and thosethat are disease-specific. In this chapter, we willfocus on generic tools. Some tools are designed28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 268 Functional Assessment 269 to provide a more sensitive assessment of abilityfor older adults with cognitive limitations. Suchtools attempt to separate disability stemmingfrom cognitive versus physical limitations.Generally speaking, since the early work of Katzand his colleagues, there has been an emphasison more detailed assessments of ADL. One widely used ADL tool is the Barthel Index (Mahoney & Barthel, 1965). This indexwas designed to measure functional levels of self-care and mobility, and it rates the ability to feedand groom oneself, bathe, go to the toilet, walk(or propel a wheelchair), climb stairs, and con-trol bowel and bladder. Tasks typically assessedwith ADL tools are listed in Box 7-2 . In using the Barthel Index or any ADL assessment tool, itis critical that the assessment be detailed andindividualized. For example, the Barthel item for\"personal toilet\" includes several tasks (washface, comb hair, shave, clean teeth), and the olderadult may be independent in some but not all ofthem and may require an assistive device forsome but not all of them. A detailed assessmentwill provide information for appropriate nursinginterventions, that is, those designed to promoteability and compensate for and prevent furtherdisability for that individual. Some older adults, specifically those with cog- nitive limitations but with good physical abili-ties, can manage their ADLs with direction andsupport (cueing and supervising). As pointed outby Tappen (1994), most ADL assessment toolswere developed for physically impaired indi-viduals and \"are not sensitive to the functionaldifficulties experienced by the persons with Alz-heimer's disease and related dementia\" (1994, p. 38). The Refined ADL Assessment Scale iscomposed of 14 separate tasks within 5 selectedADL areas (toileting, washing, grooming, dress-ing, and eating) (Tappen, 1994). This scale rep-resents an approach to ADL assessment knownas \"task segmentation,\" which means breakingdown the ADL activity into smaller steps(Morris & Morris, 1997). For example, the stepsof washing one's hands or getting dressed in themorning are fairly complex for someone withcognitive limitations. However, by cueing asneeded, the nurse can assess which steps are chal-lenging and which are not. In getting dressed inthe morning, some older adults with cognitivelimitations will require help in selecting cloth-ing, but once these clothing pieces are selectedand laid out, the older adult may require limitedcueing to progress through the complex task ofdressing. Beck (1988) has developed an assess-ment tool for dressing in persons with cognitivelimitations that is particularly detailed. The most common scale used in rehabilita- tion of older adults is the Uniform Data Systemfor Medical Rehabilitation (UDSMR) Func-tional Independence Measure (FIM). The FIMinstrument scores a person from 1 (needing totalassistance or not testable) to 7 (complete inde-pendence) and is considered an exceptionallyreliable and valid tool. Categories measured Box 7-2 Tasks Typically Assessed with ADL Assessment Tools Eating Dressing Bathing/washing GroomingWalking/ambulation Ascending/ descending stairs Communication Transferring (e.g., from bed to chair) Toileting (bowel and bladder)28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 269 270 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult include self-care, bowel and bladder, transfer,locomotion, communication, and social cogni-tion (UDSMR, 1996). This measure is done atadmission and discharge and several times inbetween to assess progress in rehabilitation. Instrumental Activities of DailyLiving (IADLs) Instrumental activities of daily living include arange of activities that are considered to be morecomplex compared with ADLs and address theolder adult's ability to interact with his or herenvironment and community. It is readilyapparent that items in IADL assessment toolsare geared more for older adults living in thecommunity; for example, items often ask aboutdoing the laundry. It has also been suggestedthat IADL tools emphasize tasks traditionallyassociated with women's work in the home(Lawton, 1972). IADLs include the ability touse the telephone, cook, shop, do laundry andhousekeeping, manage finances, take medica-tions, and prepare meals. Missing from mostIADL tools are activities that may be more asso-ciated with men, such as fixing things aroundthe house or lawn care. One of the earliest IADLmeasures was developed by Lawton and col-leagues (1969). Tasks typically assessed withIADL tools are listed in Box 7-3 . Advanced Activities of DailyLiving (AADLs) Advanced activities of daily living include soci-etal, family, and community roles, as well as par-ticipation in occupational and recreationalactivities. AADL assessment tools tend to beused less often by nurses and more often byoccupational therapists and recreation workersto address specific areas of social tasks. One toolthat seems to combine elements of ADLs,IADLs, and AADLs is the Canadian Occupa-tional Performance Measure (COPM) (Chan &Lee, 1997). Developed by Law and colleagues(1994), this tool is designed to detect changesin self-perception of occupational performanceover time. The COPM asks older adults to identify daily activities that are difficult for them to do but, atthe same time, are self-perceived as being im-portant to do. The tool asks about self-care ac-tivities (personal care, functional mobility, andcommunity management), productivity (paid/unpaid work, household management, and play/school), and leisure (quiet recreation, active rec-reation, and socialization). Consequently, inter-ventions to enhance and support ability areplanned to address those activities of importanceto the older adult. The strength of the COPM isthat it focuses on the older adult's functionalpriorities by asking about importance so thatinterventions can be tailored to enhance thosepriority activities and increase satisfaction. Physical Performance Measures One of the criticisms directed toward ADL andIADL assessment tools is that they are highlyBox 7-3 Tasks Typically Assessed with IADL Assessment Tools Using the telephone Taking medicationsShopping Handling finances Preparing meals LaundryLight or heavy housekeepingLight or heavy yardwork Home maintenance Using transportation Leisure/recreation 28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 270 Functional Assessment 271 help with outdoor tasks because thesetasks had been handled by Mr. Boyduntil just recently. When you ask whatshe means by \"recently,\" Mrs. Boydreplies that a change seems to haveoccurred within the last 6 months. You thank Mrs. Boyd for sharing this information with you, and you indicatethat most of the questions can bedirected to her but that you will be ask-ing Mr. Boyd some questions as part ofthe assessment. Mrs. Boyd seems con-cerned by this but agrees to give you anopportunity to try and ask some ques-tions of Mr. Boyd. You begin yourassessment by asking Mrs. Boyd abouther functional abilities, including ADLsand IADLs, indicating that you will beasking the same questions of Mr. Boyd. Drawing from the 10 principles of comprehensive assessment and yourknowledge of functional, physical, cog-nitive, psychological, social, and spiri-tual assessment of older adults, what arethe areas of assessment that you thinkshould be explored first with Mr. andMrs. Boyd? Will you be relying on self-report, proxy report, performance mea-sures, or all of these for the assessment?Mrs. Boyd seems to want to dominatethe interview. How will this affect theassessment process? Which other healthprofessionals do you think should beinvolved directly or in consultation inrelation to your assessment? You are visiting an older couple in the community in order to assess the cou-ple's functional ability and the potentialfor their needing assistance with ADLsor IADLs. Mr. and Mrs. Boyd are 72and 67 years old, respectively, and havebeen married for 45 years. They havelived in the same neighborhood sinceMr. Boyd retired from his bank managerjob 12 years ago. Mrs. Boyd has been ahousewife since her marriage. Mr. andMrs. Boyd have one child, a son wholives in another city about 500 milesaway. There are no other family mem-bers in their community. As you sit with both of them at the kitchen table, Mrs. Boyd tells you todirect all your questions to her becauseMr. Boyd has trouble understandingquestions. She goes on to explain thatMr. Boyd used to garden and maintainthe yard but no longer seems interestedin doing anything. He sleeps a greatdeal, seems to be eating less, and isoften uncommunicative when shespeaks to him. She says that her hus-band is getting quite forgetful and thatthis worries her because he was alwayssocially engaging and a man who couldspeak on several subjects. Mrs. Boyd tells you that she makes all the decisions and spends most of hertime planning meals, doing housework,and attending her ladies' church group.She says that she could really use some Case Study 7-128438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 271 272 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult subjective, relying on the perceptions of olderadults (and sometimes their family members) oron health care professionals who may tend to beconservative in estimating ability (Guralnik,Branch, Cummings, & Curb, 1989). Physicalperformance measures involve direct observationof activities, such as observing the older adultprepare and eat a meal, but also include tasksrelated to balance, gait, and the ability to reachand bend. The Physical Performance Test (PPT)is one example of a physical performance assess-ment tool (Reuben & Sui, 1990). The seven-item version asks the individual to write asentence, transfer five kidney beans from anemesis basin to a can (one at a time), put on andremove a jacket, pick up a penny from the floor,turn 360 degrees, and walk 50 feet (Reuben,Valle, Hays, & Sui, 1995). The benefit of using physical performance measures is related to a potential relationshipbetween physical ability and functional ability.The question is, does assessment of physical per-formance relate meaningfully to the ADL andIADL abilities of older adults? Does difficultywith walking and climbing stairs, for example, gohand-in-hand with ADL and IADL abilities suchas toileting or grocery shopping? Findings havebeen inconsistent due at least in part to the sev-eral ways of measuring physical performance andfunctional ability. Some studies have suggestedthat physical performance measures provide goodinformation to identify older adults who may beat risk for losing functional ability in ADL andbecoming prone to falls (Gill, Williams, &Tinetti, 1995; Tinetti, Speechley, & Ginter, 1988). Physical Assessment Conducting a physical assessment of an olderadult is based on technical competence in phys-ical assessment, knowledge of the normal changes(Chapter 6) and diseases associated with aging,as well as good communication skills (Chapter5). In this chapter, a basis in technical compe-tence is taken for granted and the emphasis is onpresenting physical assessment information thatis particularly relevant to the older adult. Phys-ical assessment with a \"systems\" approach re-views each body system by first taking a historyand then conducting a physical examination. Itis important to ask questions that produce anaccurate description of the older adult's physicalstatus and furthermore explore the meaning andimplications of physical status on an individualbasis. The same changes in visual acuity for twoolder adults may have quite different meaningsand implications. For one older adult, the changesmay not affect their everyday activities whereasfor the other, they may mean the loss of a dri-ver's license and accompanying distress andhardship in relation to unmet transportationneeds and decreased social contact. Physical assessment according to body systems usually involves a health care team approach.Physicians, including specialists such as a cardi-ologist, and nurses are key members of the team.Nurses may do an initial assessment or act as casefinders in the community and in clinics. Othermembers of the health care team include a nutri-tionist, respiratory therapist, social worker, phys-ical therapist, and psychologist. Circulatory Function Several factors play a role in older adults andtheir circulatory status. Age-related changes inthe heart muscle and blood vessels result in over-all decreased cardiac function. These changesplus lifestyle, including limited exercise andphysical activity, increase the likelihood thatolder adults will experience diminished circula-tory function. Other lifestyle factors that have animpact on circulatory function are smoking28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 272 Physical Assessment 273 behaviors and the consumption of alcohol. Whenthe current cohort of older adults was young, thebenefits of exercise and physical activity and thedetrimental effects of smoking were not commonknowledge. The social context was differentcompared with our current one. The cumulativeeffects of age-related changes, heredity, andlifestyle mean that there can be great variationamong older adults in relation to their circula-tory function. In addition, through the use ofmedications and assistive devices, diminishedcirculatory function may have a greater or lesserimpact on their day-to-day life. Although dis-eases of the circulatory system can occur at allages, these diseases are associated with people intheir older years, and comprehensive assessmentwill include taking a cardiac history and per-forming a physical examination. The circulatory health assessment should ad- dress family history; current problems with chestpain or discomfort, especially if associated withexertion; current diagnoses and associated med-ications as well as over-the-counter and herbalmedicines; sources of stress; and adherence to cur-rent medical regimens. The assessment shouldalso include a physical examination, assessingblood pressure, listening to chest sounds, and tak-ing a pulse rate. Other assessment protocols mayinclude an exercise stress test, blood and serumtests, electrocardiograms, and other tests forimaging and assessing the condition of the heartand blood vessels. These advanced assessmentprotocols are not usually conducted by nurses,but their results provide more detailed assess-ment information. Respiratory Function Age-related changes to bones, muscles, lung tis-sue, and respiratory fluids all contribute to therespiratory difficulties experienced by someolder adults. Older adults are particularly sus-ceptible to respiratory diseases, and the signs ofinfection may not be as obvious as they are inyounger adults. Therefore, assessment of res-piratory function should occur more often, par-ticularly with older adults who may havecompromised respiratory function because ofdisease or injury. Older adults who haverestricted mobility and have extended bedrestare especially at risk for respiratory infectionsand serious sequential complications. The respiratory assessment should ask about current medications (including prescribed, over-the-counter, and herbal) and take a history ofsmoking behavior and exposure to environmen-tal pollutants during the lifespan. Other areasfor assessment include current difficulties andanxieties associated with breathing, decreasedenergy to complete everyday tasks, frequentcoughing, and production of excessive sputum.Physical examination includes observation ofposture and breathlessness, and listening to chestsounds. Other assessment protocols includeblood and pulmonary function tests, chest x-ray,and sputum analysis. Information from thesetests assists the nurse in a total assessment of res-piratory function. Gastrointestinal Function Age-related changes in the gastrointestinal sys-tem are not major and therefore may not benoticed by many older adults. Smooth musclechanges mean decreased peristaltic action andreduced gastric acid secretion, which may affectgastric comfort and appetite. A concern of manyolder adults is constipation, which is usuallydefined as the lack of a bowel movement for 3 ormore days. Assessment of gastrointestinal func-tion begins with asking about the older adult'susual diet; appetite and changes in appetite;occurrence of nausea, vomiting, indigestion, orother stomach discomforts; and problems with28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 273 274 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult bowel function. Questions about medication useincluding prescribed, over-the-counter, and her-bal remedies are also standard. Diagnostic testingcan include barium enemas and x-rays, stoolanalysis, and examination of the colon. For some older adults, constipation is a health problem. The nurse should ask about exercise,diet, and fluid intake, and whether the older adultis using prescribed, over-the-counter, or herbalremedies to deal with constipation. A 3- to 7-daymeal diary can illustrate eating habits that mighthave an impact on constipation. Limited ingestionof fresh fruits and vegetables and fluids contributesto constipation, as does limited exercise andmobility. Older adults have a diminished sense ofthirst, and fluid intake may be inadequate tomaintain normal bowel function. Oral health assessment is an area often over- looked with older adults, and nurses should rou-tinely ask about oral health practices includingbrushing, flossing, and regular contact with adentist. Examination of the mouth shouldinclude observing the condition of the tongue,teeth, and gums for dehydration, infection, andpoor oral hygiene. Check dentures to be surethey are well-fitting, particularly if a weightchange has occurred. Especially at risk for oralhealth problems are older adults with limitedincomes who cannot manage regular contactwith a dentist and older adults in long-term carefacilities who lack the physical or cognitive abil-ity to maintain self-care in oral health. Genitourinary Function Age-related changes in the genitourinary sys-tem along with age-related diseases such as dia-betes and hypertension can have a major impacton everyday life. Bladder muscles weaken andbladder capacity is lessened. Difficulties in sens-ing that the bladder is not empty may meanthat residual urine stays within the bladder, cre-ating a medium for potential infection. Olderwomen are more likely to experience inconti-nence, which is often related to a history ofchildbirth or gynecologic surgeries. Older menmay develop problems with an enlarged prostatethat impedes the flow of urine through the ure-thra. Incontinence is not a normal part of aging;when incidents of incontinence occur regularly,this can lead to embarrassment, restricted socialactivity, and skin problems. Unmanaged incon-tinence is a major factor in the decision fornursing home placement. A serious medicalproblem, chronic renal failure can arise as acomplication of age-related diseases such as dia-betes and hypertension. This is a potentiallylife-threatening illness that requires specializedcare and may ultimately mean support throughkidney dialysis. Health history questions should attend to any previous or current difficulties related to thefrequency and voluntary flow of urine duringeither the day or night. If incontinence is aproblem, then questions should focus on thetype of incontinence: stress , urge , functional or overflow (see Chapter 12). Older adults who have problems with continence may restricttheir fluid intake, which will have implicationsfor other body systems including skin conditionand the gastrointestinal system. The nurseshould ask about fluid intake, especially caffeineand alcohol (which affect bladder tone) andobserve the skin for dehydration. The nurse alsoshould ask about medication use (prescribed,over-the-counter, and herbal remedies). Diag-nostic tests include urine analysis tests for blood,bacteria, and other components such as ketones . Other diagnostic tests may be ordered by thephysician to assess bladder muscle tone and func-tion and prostate size and potential obstructions. 28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 274 Physical Assessment 275 Sexual Function Two of the prevailing myths in our society arethat older adults are neither sexually active norinterested in sexual relationships. This is not thecase; however, several factors associated withaging do have an impact on sexual activity,including lack of partner (often through widow-hood), chronic illnesses, and medication use thatmay negatively affect performance. In conduct-ing a comprehensive assessment with an olderadult, asking about sexual function is appropri-ate. However, it is important to be knowledge-able about age-related and disease-associatedchanges in relation to sexual function and to besensitive and respectful of privacy because thisis clearly a very personal area of human function. Age-related changes for men include a de- crease in the speed and duration of erection; inwomen there is a decrease in vaginal lubrica-tion. Health and social factors may have a greatimpact on sexual activity among older adults.Chronic illness such as osteoarthritis and di-minished positive self-image because of a soci-etal emphasis on youthful beauty are two suchfactors. Assessment questions should focus onsexual function and whether there have beenany changes or concerns. These questions canopen the door to further dialogue. In the pastfew years, there has been a great deal of adver-tising on erectile dysfunction drugs by phar-maceutical companies, and these drugs arebeing used by men and women. The advertis-ing is aimed at middle-aged and older adults,and there may be some natural curiosity aboutthese new drugs. An older adult's questionsabout enhancement medications might be bestanswered in consultation with a pharmacistbecause of potential side effects and interactionswith other medications.Neurological Function The neurological system affects all other bodysystems. Age-related changes involve declines inreaction time, kinetic and body balance prob-lems, and sleep disturbances. Age-related dis-eases such Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson'sdisease and other health problems such as strokecan lead to cognitive changes including mem-ory a collection of diseases where the changes inbrain cells and activity lead to progressive lossof mental capacity. Alzheimer's disease is themost common disease of dementia. Cognitiveassessment for dementia will be discussed in alater section of this chapter. Neurological assessment of older adults includes several components. The nurse shouldask about medications (prescribed, over-the-counter, and herbal remedies) and any medicaldiagnosis related to the neurological system,such as history or family history of stroke. Thenurse should observe and ask about previous andcurrent impairments in speech, expression,swallowing, memory, orientation, energy level,balance, sensation, and motor function. Otherareas of assessment relate to the occurrence ofsleep disturbance, tremors, and seizures. Musculoskeletal Function Several age-related changes occur in the muscu-loskeletal system and lead to decreased muscletone, strength, and endurance. The stiffening ofconnective tissue (ligaments and tendons) anderosion of articular surfaces of joints create re-strictions in joint mobility. Declines in hormoneproduction contribute to bone loss, and the abil-ity to heal is reduced. Common musculoskele-tal health problems include osteoarthritis and28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 275 276 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult osteoporosis . Of particular concern are the risk of falls and the potential for fractures with asso-ciated morbidity and mortality. The most commonly reported illness among older adults is osteoarthritis, and it is morelikely to occur in the weight-bearing joints,especially the hips and knees. Because sore andstiff joints are universally associated with aging,older adults and health professionals often takean accepting attitude about these complaints.The nurse should be asking about the history ofsore joints: Which joints are affected? How longhas there been pain? What kind of pain is it? Doesit interfere with everyday activities? Is the painmanaged? If so, how is it managed? Is there ahistory of bone and muscle injuries? Has therebeen surgery? Are you trying alternative andcomplementary therapies such as acupunctureor herbal remedies? What are the pertinentlifestyle factors for this older adult, includingparticipating in exercise and physical activity? Observation of posture, stance, and walking can assist in asking the appropriate questions:Does the older adult favor one side of the bodywhile walking? Are assistive devices such as canesand walkers being used? Canes and walkersshould be at the appropriate height in relation tobody height. Ask whether an assessment wasdone by a therapist in selecting the height,weight, and type of cane or walker. In observingwalking and rising from a chair, attend to bodylanguage and facial expressions that indicate dis-comfort. Observe and examine the kind offootwear being worn. Does the footwear offer ade-quate support while promoting good circulation? The Up and Go Test provides a quick assess- ment of an older person's mobility and overallfunction. The nurse should measure a distance of10 feet from the person's chair and ask him or herto rise, walk to the line, turn, walk back, and sitdown. An average time to do this is 10 seconds.Greater than this may indicate functional prob-lems with ambulation (Reuben et al., 2003). Osteoporosis causes a gradual loss of bone mass, and bones become porous and vulnerableto fracture. Osteoporosis is associated withaging, heredity, poor calcium intake, hormonalchanges, and a sedentary lifestyle. Older adultswith osteoporosis experience symptoms of chronicback pain, muscle weakness, joint pain, loss ofheight, and decrease in mobility. Bone densitytests can compare bone mass with individuals ofcomparable or younger ages as a marker. If needed,calcium intake can be increased through diet orsupplements. The nurse should ask about symp-toms and whether a bone density test has beencarried out; if so, what were the subsequent rec-ommendations? Sensory Function Age-related and disease-related changes in sen-sory function can have profound effects on olderadults and their day-to-day functioning. Of thefive senses\u2014hearing, vision, smell, taste, andtouch\u2014it is the occurrence of diminished visionand hearing that seem to have the greatestimpact on older adults. Presbyopia refers to an age-related change in vision. The lens of the eyebecomes less elastic and this creates less efficientaccommodation of near and distant vision.Presbycusis refers to age-related progressive hearing loss. Decrements in vision and hearingcan affect communication ability with potentialconsequences to older adults' health, safety,everyday activities, socialization, and quality oflife. Screening tools for vision and hearing are oftwo types: self-report and performance-based. Specifically for vision, difficulty in reading has implications for safety in relation to read-ing instructions on prescription bottles and fol-lowing other written directions for health care.Age-related macular degeneration , the dete-28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 276 Physical Assessment 277 rioration of central vision, is the leading causeof severe vision loss in older adults in theUnited States. Older adults should undergoregular eye examinations for changes in vision(including the formation of cataracts ) and screening for ocular pressure (for glaucoma ). These performance-based tests are conducted byother health professionals\u2014optometrists andophthalmologists\u2014but nurses are often in akey position to screen for vision problems andto encourage older adults to initiate and main-tain regular visits with other health profession-als to assess vision changes. The following screening procedures are sim- ple tests for functional vision: 1) ask the olderadult to read a newspaper headline and story andobserve for difficulty and accuracy; and 2) askthe older adult to read the prescription bottleand again, observe for difficulty and accuracy. Itis important to follow up with specific questionsthat explore the vision problem from the per-spective of the individual: Is vision a problem?Does it interfere with everyday activities or withhobbies and social life? Are magnification aidsor enlarged printed material useful strategies? Ishome lighting contributing to the problem? Isit more difficult to see in the evening comparedwith other times of the day? Hearing loss is a major concern for many older adults. According to the U.S. Census Bur-eau (Bureau of the Census, 1997), about 30% ofolder adults between of 65 and 74 years of ageand 50% of those between 75 and 79 years ofage experience some hearing loss. Most hearing Box 7-4 Research Highlight Aim: To evaluate ear and hearing status in a retirement facility Methods: The research was conducted in a multilevel retirement community with three groups a total of n/H1100549 residents. Earwax occlusion, pure tone multilevel hearing impairment, resident- and staff-reported hearing handicap, and cognitive statuswere measured at time 1 and time 2 (1-4 months after time 1). Findings: Moderate but significant positive correlations were found between hearing impairment and resident-reported hearing handicap; hearing impairment and staff-reported hearing handicap; and resident-reported hearing handicap and staff-reportedhandicap. Moderate but significant negative correlations were found between cognitivefunction and hearing impairment and cognitive function and earwax occlusion. Conclusion: A higher incidence of earwax occlusion, moderate or greater hearing impair- ment, and cognitive limitations were found for residents in assisted living and nursingcare compared with residents in independent living. Recommendations for ear examina-tion, hearing screening, and communication strategies are given. Source: Culbertson, D. S., Griggs, M., & Hudson, S. (2004). Ear and hearing status in a mul- tilevel retirement facility. Geriatric Nursing, 25 , 93-98.28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 277 278 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult loss in older adults is both symmetric and bilat-eral, and hearing problems are exacerbated in anoisy environment. Nonaging-related hearingloss can be attributed to cerumen impaction, infection, occurrence of a foreign body, or oto- sclerosis . Assessment questions should ask about any hearing problems and how theseproblems affect the older adult's everyday life.The following question is useful in assessing earand hearing problems: Are you experiencing ahearing problem or any ear pain, ringing in theears, or ear discharge? A recent study reportedthat asking, \"Do you have a hearing problemnow?\" was effective in screening for hearing lossamong older adults (Gates, Murphy, Rees, &Fraher, 2003). An initial assessment questionmight be, Tell me when your hearing loss is thebiggest problem for you? The nurse who as-sesses hearing function is in a good position torecommend further diagnostic testing with anaudiologist. For older adults who wear hearing aids, the condition and working order of these aids isoften overestimated and should be regularlyassessed and monitored. A recent study con-ducted in a retirement community reported thatfor most of those wearing hearing aids, a visualcheck indicated problems with either broken ormissing components, inappropriate volume set-ting, and weak or dead batteries, and this wasespecially true for those older adults who wererelatively dependent on nursing care (Culbertson,Griggs, & Hudson, 2004). The other senses are taste, smell, and touch. Taste and smell are interrelated, and the sense ofsmell influences the sense of taste in food.Although there are some age-related changes(for example, fewer taste receptors), older adultswho are experiencing a noticeable loss of tasteand smell generally have other medical condi-tions (Ferrini & Ferrini, 2000). Medical condi-tions, especially med-ication side effects; nutritional deficiencies; poororal hygiene; and smoking can all detrimentallyaffect the senses of smell and taste. Assessmentsshould ask generally about satisfaction withtaste and smell, the duration and extent of theproblem, and the impact of the problem oneveryday life. Integumentary Function Age-related changes to the skin include loss ofelasticity, slower regeneration of cells, dimin-ished gland secretion, reduced blood supply, andstructural changes including loss of fat. Thismeans that the skin of older adults is more sus-ceptible to injury and infection and less resilientin terms of repair. Older adults with decreasedmobility and extended bedrest are at high riskfor skin damage and breakdown. For many olderadults, skin dryness and itching are two com-mon complaints. Emollients and powders canbring relief for most minor skin conditions. Asking questions about skin problems and concerns and inspecting the skin are basic ele-ments of assessment and should be done on aregular basis. If skin injury has already occurred,close monitoring and treatment are essential.The nurse should ask about rashes, itching, dry-ness, frequent bruising, and any open sores. Skinconditions can be linked with nutritional statusand body weight, and the nurse can work witha nutritionist to promote a healthy diet andappropriate weight. Any loss of sensation, par-ticularly in extremities, is a cause of concern.Impeded circulation with lack of sensation canlead to untreated skin breakdown, and preven-tion is preferable to the more serious conse-quences of infection and disability. In the eventof wounds, there are assessment tools to gauge28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 278 Physical Assessment 279 the extent and level, such as the Braden WoundIndex. Nurses with expertise in wound care areusually available in acute and long-term care forconsultation and advice. This is often a special-ized area of nursing practice. The older adult's skin should be observed for color, hydration, circulation, and intactness. Fluidintake may be less than optimal and result insevere dryness. The nurse should be asking ques-tions about skin changes, signs and symptomsof infection, usual skin care, and problems withhealing. The nurse should also observe the finger-and toenails for splitting and tears. Endocrine and MetabolicFunction Age-related changes in endocrine function in-clude decreased hormone secretion and break-down of metabolites. Of special concern for olderadults is the onset of diabetes mellitus or thyroiddisease because these diseases can be insidiousand silent. Much damage to the body can occureven before these conditions are diagnosed. Dia-betes mellitus becomes more prevalent with agebut the symptoms of polydipsia , polyphagia, and polyuria may go unnoticed for several years. Because the thirst sensation diminishes with age,older adults may not be aware of their polydip-sia. By the time the disease is diagnosed, moreserious complications, such as impaired circula-tion and foot ulcers, may have ensued. In termsof thyroid disease, the formation of nodules thatinterfere with normal thyroid functioningbecomes more common with age. Hypothyroid-ism and associated symptoms of fatigue, forget-fulness, and cold sensitivity, unfortunately maybe seen as normal \"slowing down\" with age andgo undetected. Hyperthyroidism is much morelikely in the older years, but among older adults,the typical symptom or restlessness and hyper-activity may be lacking. The more common form of diabetes mellitus among older adults is type 2 or noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus. With age, there isan increased resistance to the action of insulinwithin the body, and this change in combina-tion with lifestyle choices place some olderadults at inordinate risk for developing this dis-ease. Age-related changes, heredity, obesity,poor nutrition, inadequate physical activity, andother illnesses increase the likelihood of type 2diabetes among older adults. Given that the dis-ease may be silent for many years, it is criticalthat nurses be attuned to assessing for the riskfor developing diabetes among older adults andmonitor changes and symptoms at every oppor-tunity. As part of the health history, the follow-ing areas should be addressed: Family history of diabetes Changes in weight and appetite Fatigue Vision problems Slow wound healing Headache Gastrointestinal problems More specific symptoms should be assessed including occurrence of polyphagia, polydipsia,and polyuria. Diagnostic tests such as fastingblood sugar can provide a definitive diagnosis.The oral glucose tolerance test is of little valueby itself because the older adult may haveimpaired glucose tolerance but not diabetes(Armetta & Molony, 1999). For older adults, hyperthyroidism or an over- production of thyroid hormone does not usuallymean major changes to everyday life. Nursingobservation and assessment questions shouldaddress the occurrence of nervousness, heat28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 279 280 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult intolerance, weight loss, tremor, and palpita-tions. Hypothyroidism or below normal levelsof thyroid hormone causes several changes thatcan be uncomfortable and distressing. In thehealth history, the nurse should be assessing forskin changes (dry, flaky), fluid retention (edemaand weight gain), fatigue, forgetfulness, consti-pation, and unusual sensitivity to the cold.Diagnostic tests (TSH test, TRH test, and radi-oimmunoassay) provide definitive diagnosis. Hematologic and ImmuneFunction Several factors affect older adults' hematologicand immune systems. In relation to hematologicfunction, anemia is a common disorder amongolder adults, especially among those in nursinghomes. Although a slight decrease in hemoglo-bin occurs with aging, more often the anemia isattributable to an iron deficiency or another ill-ness. About 40% of adults age 60 or older haveiron-deficiency anemia. Assessment shouldfocus on observation of the color and quality ofthe skin and nail beds, and address food choicesand food habits. Of a more serious nature, irondeficiency can occur because of blood loss, andthe nurse should ask questions about occurrenceof blood in stools. Diagnostic tests includehemoglobin, hematocrit, complete blood count(CBC) and red blood cell (RBC) count. The immune system functions to protect the body from bacteria, viruses, and other microor-ganisms. Age-related changes to the immunesystem include diminished lymphocyte functionand antibody immune responses. These changesput older adults at risk for infections. Vaccinesfor influenza and pneumonia are given aroundmid-October and are available in physician'soffices, public health agencies, and other sites.As part of the assessment, the nurse should askabout recent and current infections and access toand use of vaccines to prevent infections. Interms of the symptoms of infection, it is impor-tant to remember that in evaluating vital signs,older adults tend to have a diminished febrileresponse to infection. Some nurses are uncomfortable talking with older adults about sexual activity, prophylaxis,and sexually transmitted disease (STD), butthese questions are an essential part of the healthassessment process. Sexually active older adults,particularly those with more than one partner,are at risk for STDs. Of particular concern is thelack of STD education (\"safe sex\") programsfocused on older adults, specifically HIV educa-tion. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isa human retrovirus that causes acquired im-mune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The diseaseis spread through parenteral and body fluids.The disease can be sexually transmitted throughanal, oral, and vaginal intercourse. AIDS is epidemic in the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control report that 11%of those infected are 50 years of age or older.Older adults may not be tested for HIV becausethey do not believe that they are at high risk orthey may be unwilling to discuss their risky sex-ual behaviors (Ferrini & Ferrini, 2000). In termsof assessment, it is important to address thetopic of sexual activity and ask the same ques-tions that would be asked of a younger person.Open-ended questions are preferable, and it willbe more productive to say, \"Tell me about yoursex life\" rather than simply asking, \"Do youhave sex?\" (Anderson, 2003). Depending on thestatus of sexual activity, other questions relatedto sexual preference and number of partnersshould be pursued. Signs and symptoms associ-ated with HIV such as weight loss, dehydration,28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 280 Cognitive Assessment 281 ataxic gait, or fatigue may go unnoticed or beattributed to age-related changes. However,once risk factors are identified, diagnostic test-ing will confirm a diagnosis. Cognitive Assessment Changes in cognitive function with age varyamong older adults and are difficult to separatefrom other comorbidities (physical and psycho-logical conditions), other age-related changes(for example, hearing), and changes in intellec-tual activity. Generally speaking, older adultsmanifest a gradual and modest decline in short-term memory and experience a reduction in thespeed in which new information is processed(Ferrini & Ferrini, 2000). Cognitive function is usually understood in relation to the qualities of attention, memory,language, visuospatial skills, and executivecapacity. The most extensively used cognitiveassessment tool is the Mini Mental State Ex-amination (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, &McHugh, 1975). The MMSE was originally de-veloped to differentiate organic from functionaldisorders and to measure change in cognitiveimpairment, but it was not intended to be usedas a diagnostic tool. It measures orientation, reg-istration, attention and calculation, short-termrecall, language, and visuospatial function. Itdoes not measure executive function, and theresults of the MMSE can vary by age and edu-cation, with older individuals and those withfewer years of formal education having lowerscores (Crum, Anthony, Bassett, & Folstein,1993). In addition, some of the MMSE itemsmay be less relevant for older adults who arehospital in-patients or who are living in long-term care facilities. For example, orientation-based questions regarding dates and day or timemay be less relevant for long-term care residentscompared with items that ask about location oftheir room in the facility. Dementia is a permanent progressive decline in cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease isthe most common form of dementia. TheDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-orders , 4th edition (DSM-IV) used by both the psychiatric and psychological communitiesstates that dementia of the Alzheimer's typetypically is manifested by both impaired mem-ory (long- or short-term) and inability to learnnew information, or recall recent information,and is distinguished by one (or more) of the fol-lowing cognitive disturbances: aphasia, apraxia,agnosia, or disturbance in executive functioning(i.e., planning, organizing, sequencing, abstract-ing). These cognitive limitations have broad andmajor implications for occupational and socialinteraction, as well as safety. The declines asso-ciated with Alzheimer's disease are progressiveand irreversible. Definitive diagnosis is possibleonly on autopsy, but diagnosis is made in theabsence of alternatives (for example, brain tumorand other neurological conditions or diseases).Several tools are available to assess cognitivefunction, and the common element of most isthe assessment of memory function. For furtherinformation and reference, the DSM-IV is avail-able on the following Web site: http://www.psychologynet.org. For nurses, assessing cognitive function is a challenging task because of the combination offactors that may be interacting: age-relatedchanges, diseases associated with aging, hered-ity, and lifestyle. Added to this is the concernthat for older adults and their families, even thesuspicion of Alzheimer's disease can be a fright-ening and discouraging experience. In recentyears, however, several medications have been28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 281 282 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult developed that claim to slow the progress of thedisease, with mixed findings. A relatively new area of assessment of older adults with progressive dementia is that of\"social ability.\" Social abilities include givingand receiving attention, participating in con-versation, recognizing social stimuli, appreci-ating humor, and being helpful to others (Baum,Edwards, & Morrow-Howell, 1993; Dawson,Wells, & Kline, 1993; Sabat & Collins, 1999).Dawson and her colleagues (1993) have devel-oped and validated a social abilities assessmentsubscale that can be used as a basis for support-ing and maintaining ability in social life asmuch as possible.

Psychological Assessment Psychological assessment of older adults pres-ents a wide continuum from positive mentalhealth to mental health problems, and the ten-dency seems to be weighted toward assessmentof mental health disorders. In this chapter wewill be looking at two areas of psychologicalassessment: quality of life, which may includeseveral positive mental health constructs, anddepression, a common mental health problem. Quality of Life Quality of life and successful aging are two cen-tral concepts in assessment and care of olderadults. Broadly speaking, quality of life encom-passes all areas of everyday life: environmentaland material components, and physical, mental,and social well-being (Fletcher, Dickinson, &Philp, 1992). Quality of life among older adultsis highly individualistic, subjective, and multi-dimensional in scope. With respect to what con-stitutes quality of life, what is important to oneperson may be quite unimportant to another.Related to quality of life is the concept of suc-cessful aging. Long associated with communityliving, successful aging has traditionally beenlinked with physical health, independence, func-tional ability, and longevity . However, other elements such as engagement in social life, self-mastery, optimism, personal meaning in life, andattainment of goals have been suggested as vitalto the idea of successful aging (Reker, Peacock,& Wong, 1987; Rowe & Kahn, 1997). Elementsof successful aging have included self-acceptance,positive relationships with others, and personalgrowth. A broad conceptualization of successfulaging means broad applicability of the conceptto older adults with various abilities and dis-abilities. If we can go beyond the idea of physi-cal health as the primary criterion for successfulaging, then we can remove the labelling of frailolder adults as being \"unsuccessful\" in theiraging (Guse & Masesar, 1999).

Simply put,the following assessment questions will opendialogue on attitude, beliefs, and feelings aboutaging and mental health. For example, the nursecan ask, \"How would you describe your qualityof life?\" and \"What would add to your qualityof life?\" Questions on successful aging are alsoinformative. For example, \"Would you describeyourself as someone who is aging successfully?\"and \"What would help you to age successfully?\" Depression Clinical depression is the most common mentalhealth problem among older adults, and it oftengoes undetected because clinicians attribute de-pressive symptoms to age-associated changes,chronic physical illness, medication side effects,or pain. The consequences of depression can beserious. The prevalence of clinical depression in older Americans is estimated to be from5%-10% among community-dwelling individ-uals, 30%-40% among recently hospitalizedindividuals, and older personsresiding in long-term care facilities (Lebowitz etal., 1997). Older Americans may experience de-pressive symptoms but not meet the establishedcriteria for clinical depression as outlined in theDSM-IV . To meet the DSM-IV criteria, an olderadult must experience five or more of the follow-ing symptoms during a 2-week period (AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2000): Sadness Lack of enjoyment of previously enjoyed activities Significant weight loss Sleep disturbance Restlessness Fatigue Feelings of worthlessness Impaired ability to think clearly or con- centrate Suicide ideation or attempt Depressed older adults may experience diffi- culty with sleeping, loss of appetite, physicaldiscomfort, anxiety, hopelessness, bouts of cry-ing, and suicide ideation. They may feel uncom-fortable in social situations and curtail theirusual social contacts and events, creating adownward spiral of depression and isolation.Depression is associated with cognitive limita-tions, and depressed older adults can experiencedisorientation, shortened attention span, emo-tional outbursts, and difficulty in intellectualfunctioning. The criteria for clinical depressionare standardized and available on the followingWeb site: http://www.psychologynet.org. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is an excellent tool (available online through www.geronurseonline.com) to evaluate depression.The interviewer asks the older person a set of 30questions. A score of 0-30 is possible, with 0-9being normal, 10-19 indicating mild depres-sion, and 20-30 indicating severe depressivesymptoms. Clinical depression may be chronic or have a shorter duration, and it is not the same as experi-encing temporary feelings of unhappiness, con-fused thinking, and somatic complaints. Nursesare in a good position, whether it be in commu-nity, acute care, or long-term care practice, toscreen for potential depression (Bruno & Ahrens,2003). A recent study found that questions ask-ing about functional ability decline, visual impair-ment, memory impairment, and using three ormore medications provided a reasonably goodscreen for depressive symptoms and consequentialhealth service utilization (Dendukuri, McCusker,28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 283 284 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult & Belzile, 2004). Even asking the question, \"Doyou often feel sad or depressed?\" is likely to opendiscussion and lead to further assessment of feel-ings of depression (Mahoney et al., 1994). Social Assessment Social functioning affects health, and health sta-tus affects the ability to socialize and interactwith others. As people age, they may find thattheir social networks become smaller and thismay place them at risk in several ways. Decadesof research have told us that individuals withlow quantity and quality of social relationshipshave a higher morbidity and mortality risk com-pared with those who have a good quantity andquality of social contacts. A supportive socialnetwork and in particular the presence of aspouse can act to maintain an older adult in thecommunity; the lack of a partner is a predictorof institutionalization. Social assessment of older adults includes col- lecting information on the presence of a socialnetwork and on the interaction between theolder adult and family, friends, neighbors, andcommunity. Kane, Ouslander, and Arass (1989)developed a broad-based social assessment thatincludes asking questions about recent life events Box 7-6 Resource List Hospital Elder Life Program (http://elderlife.med.yale.edu): The Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) is a patient-care program, developed by doctors and nurses at the Yale School ofMedicine, that is designed to prevent delirium among hospitalized older patients. The John A. Hartford Foundation Institute for Geriatric Nursing (http://www.hartfordign.org and www.geronurseonline.com): These Web sites offer links to several assessment tools including SPICES (an overall assessment tool), Fall Risk Assessment, and the Geriatric DepressionScale. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (http://www.nice.org.uk): This agency is an excellence-in-practice organization responsible for providing national guid-ance on the promotion of good health and the prevention and treatment of ill health inthe United Kingdom. The Web site offers assessment and prevention tools in relation tofalls and older adults. Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (http://www.rnao.org/bestpractices): This is the profes- sional association of registered nurses in Ontario, Canada. It provides several best prac-tices including assessment guidelines, for example, in the areas of pain, stage I to IVpressure ulcers, foot ulcers for people with diabetes, and screening for delirium, dementia,and depression in older adults. 28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 284 Spiritual Assessment 285 (such as death of a spouse), living arrangements,everyday activities requiring help (and who usu-ally provides help), potential isolation (fre-quency of leaving the house and having visitors),adequacy of income, and sources of health carecoverage. Having a social network does not necessarily mean that there are social supports. However,the Lubben Social Network Scale contains 10items, 3 of which have been found to differenti-ate those who are isolated from those who arenot (Kane, 1995). These questions are: Is there any one special person you could call or contact if you needed help? In general, other than your children, how many relatives do you feel close toand have contact with at least once amonth? In general, how many friends do you feel close to and have contact with atleast once a month? The more important aspects of social support may be the number of supportive persons andthe various types of support (emotional, instru-mental, and informational) that are available.Seeman and Berkman (1988) have identifiedfour questions that assess the adequacy of socialsupport. These questions are: When you need help, can you count on anyone for house cleaning, groceries, ora ride? Could you use more help with daily tasks? Can you count on anyone for emotional support (talking over problems or help-ing you make a decision)? Could you use more emotional help (receiving sufficient support)?Using these kinds of questions will help assess the adequacy and range of support avail-able to an older adult. Spiritual Assessment Spiritual assessment is an integral part of com-prehensive assessment and provides a basis foran individualized plan of care (Forbes, 1994).Although there is a link between religiosity andspirituality, the two concepts are not synony-mous. Religiosity refers to believing in God,organized rituals, and specific dogma; spiritual-ity refers to broader ideas of belief that encom-pass personal philosophy and an understandingof meaning and purpose in life. Having reli-gious beliefs may foster spirituality, but thosewithout formal religious beliefs still can expe-rience spirituality. Most health service intakeforms have a place for collecting information onformal religious affiliation, but this does notnecessary mean that the older adult is practic-ing his or her faith, or is active in a place ofworship. One of the earliest guidelines for spiritual assessment was developed by Stoll (1979), andit contains questions that address both religios-ity and spirituality. The guidelines are dividedinto four areas: 1. The concept of God or deity (for exam- ple, \"Is religion or God significant toyou?\") 2. Personal source of strength and hope (for example, \"What is your source ofstrength and hope?\") 3. Significance of religious practices and rituals (for example, \"Are there any reli-gious practices that are important toyou?\")28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 285 286 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult 4. Perceived relationship between spiritual belief and health (for example, \"Hasbeing sick made any difference in yourfeelings about God or the practice ofyour faith?\") Nurses may not be comfortable conducting a spiritual assessment because it may seem inap-propriately invasive or because it is an area thatsome nurses do not feel adequately prepared toaddress as an unmet need. If the intake recordindicates a formal religious affiliation, then it isfairly straightforward to ask, \"Do you have anyreligious needs?\" or \"Would you like to speakwith a pastoral care worker?\" Questions that ad-dress spirituality can begin by asking, \"Are youhaving a spiritual need? Is there some way thatI might help with your spiritual needs?\" An-other spiritual assessment question asks, \"Haveyour health problems affected your feelings ofmeaning or purpose?\" Several helpful tools arepresented in Chapter 22. Spiritual assessment isan area that would benefit greatly from moreresearch. Other Assessment: Overweight and Obesity Overweight and obesity have become a majorhealth problem among Americans, includingolder Americans. Given the obesity prevalencein middle-aged adults, the proportions andnumbers of obese older adults is expected toincrease substantially over the next decade(Arterburn, Crane, & Sullivan, 2004). In 1998,the National Institutes of Health released thefirst federal overweight and obesity guidelines,which are based on the body mass index (BMI),a ratio of weight (in pounds) to height (in inchessquared), as an assessment tool. The BMI is anumber usually between 16 and 40. A BMIbetween 25 and 29 is considered \"overweight\"and more than 30 is considered \"obese.\" Forinstructions on how to calculate a BMI, go tothe Centers for Disease Control Web site: www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/bmi-adult.htm. The adverse effects of obesity in relation to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis,and gallbladder disease are well documented.Obese older adults are likely to experience bal-ance and mobility problems that place them atrisk for falls. One study reported obesity asbeing a risk factor for decline in functional abil-ity (as assessed by needing assistance with ADLsand IADLs) (Jensen & Friedmann, 2002).Unfortunately, there has been little research con-ducted on obese older adults, and this remainsan area for further research and tool refinement.It is not clear whether the markers for over-weight and obesity are relevant to older adultswho may experience illness-related weight gainor loss. It has been suggested that for manyolder adults, an emphasis on weight mainte-nance might be the best approach until moreevidence is accumulated through research(Jensen & Friedmann, 2002). Nurses can assess for overweight and obesity using the BMI and by asking about a history ofweight change. If food intake is a concern, acommon approach is to begin with a 3- to 7-daymeal diary. This information can assist in deter-mining a person's food habits. Developing anIndividualized Plan of Care At the beginning of this chapter, we indicatedthat the basis of an individualized plan of care28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 286 Developing an Individualized Plan of Care 287 for an older adult is a comprehensive assessment,and we have reviewed functional, physical, cog-nitive, psychological, social, and spiritual assess-ment. In Box 7-7 , we provide 10 guidelines for comprehensive assessment that form a basiswith which to develop an individualized plan ofcare. Additionally Table 7-1 provides a sum- mary of the quality assessment tools recom-mended as best practices by the John A.Hartford Foundation and Nurse Competence inAging initiative (available online at www.geronurseonline.org). Box 7-7 Ten Principles of Comprehensive Assessment 1. The cornerstone of an individualized plan of care for an older adult is a comprehensive assessment. 2. Comprehensive assessment takes into account age-related changes, age-associated diseases, heredity, and lifestyle. 3. Nurses are members of the health care team, contributing to and drawing from the team to enhance the assessment process. 4. Comprehensive assessment is not a neutral process. 5. Ideally, the older adult is the best source of information to assess his or her health. When this is not possible, family members or caregivers are acceptable as secondarysources of information. When the older adult cannot self-report, physical performancemeasures may provide additional information. 6. Comprehensive assessment should first emphasize ability and then should address dis- ability. Appropriate interventions to maintain and enhance ability and to improve orcompensate for disability should follow from a comprehensive assessment. 7. Task performance and task capacity are two difference perspectives. Some assessment tools ask \"Do you dress without help?' (performance) whereas others ask, \"Can youdress without help?\" (capacity). Asking about capacity will result in answers thatemphasize ability. 8. Assessment of older adults who have cognitive limitations may require task segmenta- tion, or the breaking down of tasks into smaller steps. 9. Some assessment tools or parts of assessment tools may be more or less applicable depending on the setting, that is, community, acute care, or long-term care settings. 10. In comprehensive assessment, it is important to explore the meaning and implications of health status from the older adult's perspective. For example, the same changes invisual acuity for two older adults may have quite different meanings and implicationsfor everyday life. 28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 287 288 Chapter 7: Assessment of the Older Adult Table 7-1 Assessment Tools Available through the Try This Series via www.geronurseonline.com (2005) SPICES: An Overall Assessment Tool of Older Adults Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Assessing Pain in Older Adults Fall Risk Assessment Assessing Nutrition in Older Adults Sexuality Assessment Urinary Incontinence Assessment Hearing Screening Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) Elder Abuse and Neglect Assessment Beers' Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in the Elderly Alcohol Use Screening and Assessment The Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) Horowitz's Impact of Event Scale: An Assessment of Post Traumatic Stress in Older Adults Preventing Aspiration in Older Adults with Dysphagia Immunizations for the Older Adult Avoiding Restraints in Patients with Dementia Brief Evaluation of Executive Dysfunction: An Essential Refinement in the Assessment of Cognitive Impairment Assessing Pain in Persons with Dementia Therapeutic Activity Kits Recognition of Dementia in Hospitalized Older Adults Wandering in the Hospitalized Older Adult Communication Difficulties: Assessment and Interventions Assessing and Managing Delirium in Persons with Dementia Decision Making and Dementia 28438_CH07_265_292.qxd 6/6/06 5:11 PM Page 288 Glossary 289 Agnosia: Loss ability to understand auditory, visual, or other sensations Aphasia: Impaired ability to communicate Apraxia: Inability to perform purposeful movements Cataracts: A clouding of the lens of the eye, its capsule, or both Cerumen: Ear wax Dysphagia: Difficulty in swallowing Functional incontinence: The genitourinary tract is functioning and incontinence is due to immobil-ity or cognitive limitations Glaucoma: An eye disease of increased intraocular pres- sure that can lead to blindness if not treated Ketones: Acetone bodies in the urine indicating inade- quate management of diabetes mellitusLongevity: A long life Macular degeneration: Loss of central vision, associated with aging Osteoarthritis: Deterioration of joints and vertebrae as a consequence of wear and tear Osteoporosis: Reduction in bone mass leading to thin, weak bones Otosclerosis: Damage to the inner ear of unknown cause that leads to progressive deafness Overflow incontinence: Incontinence that occurs because the bladder has not been emptied and ithas become overdistended Polydipsia: Excessive thirst Polyphagia: Excessive eating Polyuria: Excessive urinationPersonal Reflections 1. In this chapter, we have underlined the importance of the health care team and consul- tation with team members. Reflect on your understanding of the contributions of teammembers in relation to assessment of older adults. What are some of your personal attri-butes in terms of working as a member of the health care team? 2. How would you define \"successful aging\" in relation to your own aging? What are the implications of your definition in relation to decisions you might make during your life-time? How might this definition affect the way you view the aging process of others? Critical Thinking Exercises 1. In this chapter, we have said that comprehensive assessment is not a neutral process. Reflect on what that really means and what kinds of things might constitute anunwanted bias to the assessment process. 2. In this chapter, we have emphasized that comprehensive assessment makes use of nurs- ing knowledge and understanding of the combined factors of age-related changes, age-associated diseases, heredity, and lifestyle choices. Think of an older adult for whom youhave provided care and, without using names, describe that person and try to outline thefactors (age-related changes, age-associated diseases, heredity, and lifestyle choices) thatare relevant for his or her health assessment.

The nurse must have basicknowledge about the indications for the med-ication, correct dosages, correct administration,anticipated side effects, potential adverse drugreactions, and contraindications for each med-ication. The nurse must also, however, haveknowledge of the unique biopsychosocial as-pects of medication administration in the el-derly. These include knowing how aging affectsthe metabolism of medications (\"bio\"), beingaware of psychological influences on adherenceto medication regimens, and the social aspectsthat are integral to a successful outcome. Thischapter will review the biopsychosocial aspectsof medication administration, while stressingthe influence of the nurse on successful medica-tion outcomes. Demographics Today, the geriatric population (persons /H11022 65) makes up about 13% of the general population.That number is expected to increase to greaterthan 20% by the year 2040. Elderly patients,however, consume about 33% of all prescriptionmedications and over-the-counter drugs (Dela-fuente & Stewart, 2001). Overall, the elderlyhave more disease states than other populationsand therefore require the use of more medica-tions. Thus, effective and safe drug therapy isone of the greatest challenges within the elderlypopulation. One national survey of noninstitu-tionalized persons, published in 2002, foundthat 40% of adults aged greater than 65 yearsused 5 or more different medications per weekand 12% used 10 or more different medications.Also, these persons randomly filled additionalprescriptions when acute medical conditionsarose, such as infections or pain. Elderly personswho reside in nursing homes and assisted livingfacilities typically use even more medications(Beers & Berkow, 2000). The Effects of Aging on Drugs Normal aging is associated with certain physi-ological changes that can significantly influencedrug response. Both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics play a role in how a per- son will respond to a drug. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics is the time course by whichthe body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, andexcretes drugs (Beers & Berkow, 2000). In otherwords, pharmacokinetics speaks to how drugsmove through the body and how quickly thisoccurs. Absorption is defined as the movement of the drug from the site of administration, acrossbiological barriers, into the plasma. Althoughthe rate of drug movement through the bodymay decrease with age, the extent of drugabsorption is least affected by age. Certain dis-ease states, however, and the simultaneous useof several medications has been shown to de-crease absorption of some medications (Cali-fornia Registry, 2004). Distribution is the movement of the drug from the plasma into the cells. As patients age,total body water declines and fat stores increase.This physiological change affects the distributionphase of highly water-soluble and fat-solubledrugs. Therefore, the volume of distributionmay be decreased for drugs that are highly watersoluble and increased for drugs that are highly28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 294 Drug-Related Problems in the Elderly 295 lipid soluble. For example, diazepam (Valium)is a highly lipid-soluble medication. Diazepamhas a documented long half-life in a young adult(the time it takes for half of the drug taken to bemetabolized), but in an elderly person the half-life is even longer due to the increase in the fatstores. For the elderly patient who may be moresensitive to the side effects of diazepam, thelonger half-life may cause prolonged adverseeffects. With age, hepatic mass and hepatic blood flow decrease (Beers & Berkow, 2000). There-fore, the hepatic metabolism of medications is reduced. Also with age, the renal mass and renalblood flow are reduced. This physiologicalchange will decrease the amount of drug thatgoes through renal excretion. This can result in higher, and potentially toxic, levels of drug inthe body of the older adult, compared to thesame dosage administered to a younger person.Because renal function tends to decline withage, drug doses should be reviewed and adjustedperiodically in all elderly patients. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics is the time course and effectof drugs on cellular and organ function. In otherwords, pharmacodynamics is what the drugs doonce they're in the body. The effects of similar drug concentrations at the site of action may be greater or less thanthose in younger patients. Therefore, the poten-tial for increased sensitivity to medications at the cellular level must be considered whenadministering them to an elderly patient. Forinstance, in the elderly person, an increasedreceptor response is seen for benzodiazepines,opiates, and warfarin (Coumadin). This results inbenzodiazepines producing increased sedation,opiates analgesia and respiratory sup-pression, and warfarin producing an increasedanticoagulant effect (California Registry, 2004). Drug-Related Problems in the Elderly About one third of drug-related hospitalizationsoccur in persons over 65 years old (Beers &Berkow, 2000). Even though medications pro-vide benefit by preventing and treating disease,older people are more susceptible to drug-related problems, including adverse drug reactions (ADRs) , food-drug interactions, polypharmacy, inappropriate prescribing, andnoncompliance. Adverse Drug Reactions The World Health Organization definesADRs as \"any noxious, unintended, and unde-sired effect of a drug, which occurs at dosesused in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis, ortherapy\" (Delafuente & Stewart, 2001, p. 289).Two different types of ADRs are drug-drug interactions and drug-disease interactions . Drug-drug interactions can be defined as thealteration of the pharmacokinetics or pharma-codynamics of drug A when taken at the sametime as drug B. Drug-disease interactions aredefined as the worsening of a disease by amedication ( see Table 8-1 ). Older patients, with multiple disease states, often consume many different medications totreat both acute and chronic medical conditions.As a result, ADRs occur often in older patients.Age-related alterations in drug distribution,hepatic metabolism, and renal clearance all playa significant role in the chances of an elderlypatient developing an ADR. ADRs in elderlypatients may decrease functional status, increase28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 295 296 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values health services use, and in some rare cases haveresulted in death. Overall, ADRs represent amajor problem for elderly patients. In additionto better prescribing patterns from the physi-cians, there's a need for nurses and pharmaciststo increase medication monitoring. Food-Drug Interactions Undetected food-drug interactions may lead to serious morbidity and mortality in the olderadult. The effect of certain foods on drugsmetabolized by the CYP450 families and onTable 8-1 Drug-Disease Interactions the Drugs Urinary retention hyperplasia Chronic depression Dementia Anticholinergics, opioids Increased confusion, deliriumDepression Alcohol, /H9252-blockers, centrally acting disease renal failure Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin)Anticoagulants (e.g., 296 Problems Elderly 297 drugs susceptible to chelation and absorptionhas recently been recognized. Foods may containcompounds that lead to failure of an intendeddrug effect; alternately, malnutrition can lead topoor metabolism of drugs (McCabe, 2004). The presence or absence of food may reduce or increase the bioavailability of a medication,leading to unanticipated effects. The first\"lethal\" food-drug interaction recognized wasthat of cheese and monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAOIs). The interaction of food and drug inthis instance could lead to extremely high bloodpressure and stroke. Grapefruit juice is knownto interact with antihistamines, and greens withwarfarin. Herbal and dietary supplements mayinteract with medications, affecting metabolismof the drug. Natural licorice may induce hyper-tension and interfere with certain drugs. Anti-biotics may be susceptible to chelation andabsorption by fortified cereals, calcium-fortifiedorange juice, or protein beverages. These inter-actions reduce the efficacy of the antibiotic andmay lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (McCabe,2004). Malnutrition can also affect the metabolism of medications. Gut integrity is necessary for drugmetabolism; the patient who goes without foodfor several days may change the integrity of thegut and thus negatively impact drug metabolismand absorption. Patients receiving nutritionalsupplementation are at increased risk for drug-induced nutritional problems. Medications canalso cause malnutrition. Chemotherapeutic agentsmay change appetite, cause nausea and vomiting,and affect the intestinal mucosa. Anticonvulsantscan create marginal nutrient states in older adults.Diuretics affect the fluid and electrolyte balance.And excessive, chronic alcohol intake can lead topoor nutritional intake and changes in drugmetabolism (McCabe, 2004).Polypharmacy Many older patients are prescribed multipledrugs, take over-the-counter medications, andare often prescribed additional drugs to treat theside effects of the medications that they arealready taking. The increase in the number ofmedications often leads to polypharmacy , which is defined as the prescription, adminis-tration, or use of more medications than areclinically indicated in a given patient. Potentialadverse outcomes of polypharmacy includeadverse drug reactions, increased cost, and non-compliance. See Case Study 8-1 . Several interventions that may help the pre- scriber to prevent polypharmacy include know-ing all medications, by both brand and genericname, being used by the patient; identifyingindications for each medication; knowing theside effect profiles of the medications; eliminat-ing drugs with no benefit or indication; andavoiding the urge to treat a drug reaction withanother drug. Patient education on the risks ofpolypharmacy may help the patient as well. The nurse plays a key role in screening for polypharmacy. When determining if a medica-tion is appropriate for a patient, the nurseshould ask the following questions: Is the medication necessary? For exam- ple, does the patient have a medicalproblem for every medication ordered? Do the risks outweigh the benefits? If there's a potential for an ADR, will thebenefit of administering the medicationoutweigh the risk of the ADR? Oneexample might be examining the bene-fit of administering vancomycin(Vancocin) to a renally impaired 5:12 PM Page 297 298 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values is resistant to all other antibiotics. Inthis case, the benefits of the medicationprobably outweigh the risks to the kid-ney, as long as renal function is carefullymonitored and dosage is adjustedaccording to renal function as well aspeak and trough levels. Is the frequency of the medication prescribed appropriately? For instance,sustained-release morphine (MS Contin)can be ordered every 12-24 hourswhereas immediate-release morphine(MSIR) is ordered more frequently. Is the medication prescribed in the most appropriate dose, route, and/or form?Some elderly patients have difficultyswallowing; therefore, other dosage formssuch as suppositories or topical patchesmay be more appropriate. See Table 8-2 for a quick summary of this topic.lowing medications: as needed.Questions 1. Which medication(s) may have contributed to Ms. Espinoza'saltered mental status? 2.

Goulding(2004) found that, between 1995 and 2000, atleast one inappropriate drug was administeredto 7.8% of the elderly patients in her study.Also, at least one drug classified as \"never or rarelyappropriate\" was prescribed to between 3.7% and3.8% of patients. A large share of the inappropri-ate drugs in this study was pain medications andcentral nervous system drugs. The odds thatfemale patients were being prescribed inappro-priate medications were double that of males. One example of the potential effects of inap- propriate prescribing was described by Wagneret al. (2002). This research team analyzed theMedicaid claims data for a 42-month period inNew Jersey. After statistical adjustment for age,sex, race, nursing home residence, exposure to\"other\" medications, diagnosis of epilepsy anddementia, and hospitalization in the last 6months, the incidence of hip fracture was signif-icantly higher in persons who took benzodi-azepines. Not only were hip fractures associatedwith benzodiazepine use, short half-life benzodi-azepines were not safer than long half-life benzo-diazepines. Hip fracture risk was highest in thefirst 2 weeks after starting a benzodiazepine.Kudoh and colleagues (2004) found that long-term elderly users of benzodiazepines increasedtheir risk of postoperative confusion, as well. Compliance Although age alone does not affect compliance , about 40% of elderly persons do not adhere totheir medication regimen (Beers & Berkow, 2000,p. 69). The more complex the medication regi-men, the less likely the patient will comply. Forelderly patients, nonadherence may result fromthe patient trying to avoid side effects and there-fore reduce the amount of drug consumed, lackof money, or forgetfulness (early dementia).Seniors may simply not be taking the medica-tions they need because they cannot afford them.Compliance can be encouraged by establishing agood relationship with the patient, providingeducation about possible side effects, providingclear instructions for how the medication shouldbe taken, encouraging questions from the patient,and providing home nursing support as needed. Table 8-2 Questions to Ask to Avoid Inappropriate Prescribing for Elderly Patients Is the treatment necessary? Is this the safest drug available? Is this the most appropriate dose, route of administration, and dosage form? Is the frequency appropriate? Do the benefits outweigh this risk?

The benefit ofmedication use is to provide positive outcomes;the risk may include unwarranted side effects.There are several medications available on themarket that provide excellent results but are notideal for use in elderly patients. Although somemedications cannot be avoided entirely due tothe disease state, one should be aware of Citro-Mag (magnesium citrate) x1 to treat the constipation.Protonix (pantoprazole sodium), 40 mgqd, was also ordered for GI prophylaxis. Postoperatively, Mrs. Tyler was put on Demerol (meperidine) per PCA pump,with promethazine as needed. Threedays later, she presented with alteredmental status and hallucinations. Herurine and blood cultures were negativefor infection. The daughter states thatMrs. Tyler has never acted like thisbefore and that she is very concernedabout her mother's condition.Questions 1. What home medications may have contributed to Mrs. Tyler's fall? 2. What symptoms does Mrs. Tyler display that may be drug related? 3. Would you alter Mrs. Tyler's hos- pital drug regimen in any way?Mrs. Tyler is an 84-year-old white female with a past medical history ofbreast cancer, mastectomy, dementia,osteoporosis, depression, and a righthip fracture and repair 1 month ago.She also has a history of anxiety. Herhome medications include Prozac (flu-oxetine hydrochloride), 20 mg qd; 10 mg qd; andValium (diazepam), 10 mg at bedtimedaily. She has no known drug allergies. Mrs. Tyler was admitted to the emer- gency room after a fall at her assisted liv-ing facility. She suffered a fractured lefthip. She was admitted to your nursingunit with the new fracture and constipa-tion. Medications ordered on admissionincluded: normal saline IV at 75 hour;Hep-Lock (heparin), 5,000 IV pushq Study PM Page 300 Laboratory Values 301 sible side effects, especially when administeringmedications to an elderly patient who often hasmultiple comorbidities. The Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappro- priate Medication Use in the Elderly (Beers, 1997;Fick et al., 2003) is widely recognized as the stan-dard of care for medication prescription. A panelof experts identified medications that have poten-tial risks that would outweigh the benefits of themedication in the older adult population (Hart-ford Institute, n.d.). See Case Study 8-2 . If any of these medications are administered, the lowest and most effective dose should bestarted first, then titrated slowly upward untilthe desired effect is obtained. Remember thesaying \"Start low and go slow.\" This strategywill help to prevent ADRs that may prolong ahospital stay, lead to a hospitalization, and evencause harm to the patient and others. Laboratory Values Due to physiologic changes, laboratory resultsfor older adults may differ from those of youngeradults; that is, the reference ranges or \"normals\"may be different. Other variables may also affectthe laboratory results obtained. For instance,leaving the tourniquet in place too long cancause an elevation in the results of a cholesteroltest, as may exercise or position changes imme-diately before the blood is drawn. Or, the amountof anticoagulant in a vacutainer tube may vary,influencing the results. Results from venous andcapillary sites can vary within the same indi-vidual. The same person may also vary in resultsover time, simply due to normal biologic events.And the normal aging process can cause varia-tions in normals for the older population. Forexample, normal changes with aging occur glucose (fasting, 1- and 2-hour postpran-dial), and vitamin B 12 (Brigden & Heathcote, 2000). Laboratory values and medication adminis- tration go hand in hand. Laboratory work maybe done to: Monitor compliance with medication administration Check for therapeutic or toxic levels of medication in the blood Evaluate the body's ability to metabo- lize medications Evaluate the need for medications to treat a condition Whatever the case, it is important that the nursebe aware of the relationship between laboratoryvalues and medication administration. Medication Blood Levels(Therapeutic Blood Levels) The amount of medication circulating in theblood can be monitored for some medications.This may include monitoring for blood levels ofmedications taken on a routine basis or in anemergency situation where drug overdose is sus-pected. Some medications commonly monitoredin the elderly include cardiac medications, anti-epileptics, and certain antibiotics. The importance of measuring medication blood levels is to monitor the metabolism of themedication so that the correct dosage can begiven, at the correct intervals, to obtain the bestresults without side effects or adverse drug reac-tions. Metabolism of medications may be alteredin the elderly, so this concept is an importantone. Some medications are toxic to the body if28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 301 302 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values the level is too high, and may be ineffective ifthe level is too low. Compliance with medication administration can also be monitored through this type of test-ing. Key words associated with measuring theamount of circulating medications are random, trough, and peak . Random Medication LevelsRandom medication levels are not dependentupon the administration time of the medication.The blood level is drawn when the order isreceived. An example for this type of laboratorywork might include the patient who is admit-ted to the emergency room with altered mentalstatus and a drug overdose is suspected.Trough Medication LevelsTrough levels are dependent upon the adminis-tration times of the medication. The troughlevel is drawn at the time that the blood levelis expected to be at its lowest: right before adose is due. An abnormally high trough levelindicates that the time between doses should beadjusted (lengthened); an abnormally lowtrough level indicates that the time betweendoses should be shortened. An example of thistype of blood work might be the elderly patientwho is receiving vancomycin (Vancocin) for aninfection, in whom toxic levels must be avoided.Peak Medication LevelsPeak levels are also dependent upon the time ofadministration. This varies according to theroute of administration and for different med-ications. An abnormally high peak indicatesthat the dosage needs to be reduced; an abnor-mally low peak indicates that the dosage shouldbe increased. The peak is typically drawn withina set time after a dose is given, and a trough fol-lows right before the next dose is given. SeeTable 8-3 for further information on peak and trough levels from the authors' own facility. As you can see, it is vitally important that the nurse know the type of level to be drawn (ran-dom, peak, or trough) and then draw it at the cor-rect time. The dosage of the drug, the frequencyof administration, and the safety of the patientdepend on the accuracy of the blood draw. Toxic blood levels of medications may pres- ent in unusual ways in the older population. Itis also possible that the older adult will experi-ence side effects at levels that are not consideredto be toxic in younger persons. For instance,drug toxicity from digoxin, a cardiac medica-tion, may be evident in symptoms, although thepatient's blood level is in the normal range. Caution must always be used with the inter- pretation of medication level laboratory resultsand with dosage adjustments based on a singlevalue. It must be ascertained that the blood wasdrawn as the order intended, that the precedingmedications were given on time with no dosesmissed, and that there were no unintendeddrug-drug or food-drug interactions that mayhave affected the result. Birnbaum et al. (2003)studied a group of 56 elderly nursing home res-idents whose average age was 80.1 years. Allreceived phenytoin as an antiepileptic drug. Allhad been on the same dose for at least 4 weeks,and all doses were given, as far as the researcherscould tell. Although all of the right parameterswere in place, phenytoin levels varied as muchas two- to threefold for some patients, from 9.7micrograms per ml to 28.8 mcg per ml. Theauthors attribute the variability to variations inhydration status and changes in gut motility. Renal and Hepatic Function As stated earlier, drugs are metabolized differ-ently in the older adult. The kidneys and the28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 302 Laboratory Values 303 liver may not function as well as in the youngerperson. This can affect how medications arecleared from the body and the likelihood of sideeffects or toxic levels of medications. Certainmedications, such as aminoglycosides, nonster-oidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ACEinhibitors, and IV contrast materials (used for x-rays) can also affect renal function in the elderlyperson (Reuben et al., 2004, p. 140). Laboratorytests that are commonly used to monitor thefunction of the kidneys and the liver, and to helpdecide the dosage and timing of medications,include the following: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): This test is used as a gross measure of glomerularfunction and the production andexcretion of urea (Fischbach, 1996, p. 351). Impairment of kidney func-tion will result in an elevated BUN.The rate at which BUN rises is influ-enced by the degree of tissue necrosisand the rate at which the kidneysexcrete urea nitrogen. Creatinine: This is a substance removed from the body by the kidneys. Measure-ment of the creatinine level will give aclue as to the function of the kidneys. Forinstance, a disorder of the kidneys willincrease the level of creatinine in theblood. It is a more specific indicator ofkidney disease than the BUN (Fischbach,1996).

This formula takes into account thepatient's weight, gender, age, and renal function: Creatinine creatinine (for women, multiply the result by 0.85) Manufacturers of medications affected by thecreatinine clearance rate will help the providerby suggesting appropriate dosages according tothe rate. Alkaline phosphatase: This is an indicator of liver disease. Levels in the blood willrise when excretion of this enzyme isimpaired (Fischbach, 1996). Other indi-cators of liver health or are thealanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartateaminotransferase (AST), albumin, biliru-bin, protein, and coagulation factors. SeeTable 8-4 for further information about normal laboratory values.Laboratory Values as Indicatorsof Need for Medications The third connection between laboratory valuesand medications is when laboratory values indi-cate a need for medications. See Table 8-5 for some examples of this concept. The Role of the Nurse The nurse has several responsibilities regard-ing laboratory values and medications. Theseinclude: Being aware of the routes of elimination of medications and the implications ofaging on these routes Being aware of the effects of aging on the typical signs and symptoms of med-ication toxicity Maintaining knowledge of the signs of medication toxicity in the older adult Drawing random, peak, and trough medication levels correctly Knowing when to notify the prescriber of an abnormal result Table 8-4 Normal Laboratory Values (serum) Test Body System Normal LevelsBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) Renal 7-23 mg/dlCreatinine Renal Guide at http://www.utmb.edu/lsg/28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 304 Challenges to Successful Medication Regimens for the Older Adult 305 Challenges to SuccessfulMedication Regimens for the Older Adult For a medication to work properly, the rightdrug must be taken in the right amount, by theright route, at the right times, by the rightpatient. Failure to follow these \"five rights\" candelay or prevent the outcome intended by thehealth care provider.The five rights are important in every set- ting. In the inpatient setting, such as the hos-pital or nursing home, the physician, the nurse,and the pharmacist ensure that the five rightsare followed. In the outpatient or home setting,it ultimately becomes the patient's responsibil-ity to ensure that they take the right medica-tion by the right route, at the right times, inthe right dose. Failure of the patient to followthese requirements is often labeled noncompli-ance or nonadherence to the recommendationsTable 8-5 Selected Laboratory Values Indicating a Need for Medication Selected Potential Laboratory Normal Abnormal Examples of Medications Test Values Condition Nontreatment IndicatedAlbumin 3.5-5.0 gm/dl Hypoalbuminemia Edema Vitamin timeProthrombin 11-13 seconds /H1102126 seconds Formation of blood Warfarin acid Pain in men, 2.9-6.0 mg/dlin women Antibiotic 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 305 306 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values of the health care provider. This section willexamine issues related to the older adult in thehome setting. Let's examine these five rights in more detail. Right Drug Assuming that the right medication is orderedby the provider and the right drug is filled by the pharmacy, there are still factors that can interfere with the patient receiving the rightdrug in the home setting. These might include: Taking medications prescribed for another person Keeping old medications stockpiled and forgetting which ones are currentlyprescribed Receiving prescriptions from two differ- ent providers Misunderstanding the use of over-the- counter medications Right Amount Ensuring that the right amount of drug is takencan be tricky in the home. Confounding factorsmight include: Lack of understanding of the prescribed dosage, number of pills, or amount ofliquid medication Using teaspoons or other utensils to measure rather than measuring cups, orusing the wrong size syringe Confusion about medication schedules The same prescriptions being ordered by more than one health care provider Forgetting which medications have already been taken Box 8-1 Research Highlight Aim: This survey asked what nurses felt about making and reporting medication errors. Methods: Nursing2002 staff surveyed nurses about their attitudes and experiences regarding medication administration and making mistakes. The analysis of the poll was based on 775responses. The typical respondent was a 42-year-old BSN, RN with 11 years of experienceworking on a medical/surgical unit of a hospital. Findings: Seventy-nine percent of nurses felt that most medication errors occurred when nurses did not follow the five rights of administration. Ninety-one percent of nurses feltthat thoroughly analyzing incident reports about medication errors was an important stepin future prevention of mistakes. Students were more likely to initiate an incident reportfor another nurse's mistake than were the nurses who worked on the units. Conclusion: Although responses varied on a number of questions, such as the use of increased technology in medication administration and when and how to report medication errors, themajority of nurses agreed that they were responsible for assuring safe medication administra-tion to patients and that using the five rights was important for preventing errors.

Getting to the root of medica- Survey 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 306 Other Issues That Interfere with Medication Administration 307 Other Issues ThatInterfere with Medication Administration Other situations may interfere with the abilityof the older adult to take the right medicationat the right time in the right dose by the rightroute by the right person. Function Impaired function , or the inability to perform activities of daily living , can interfere with adherence to a prescribed medication regimen.For instance, a person with arthritis of the handsor paralysis of the arm can have difficulty open-ing bottles; a person with a stroke can have dif-ficulty walking to get her medications; a personwith impaired mobility may have problems get-ting a glass of water from the kitchen. Swallow-ing can also be functionally impaired and causechoking, aspiration, and the inability to swal-low medications. Impaired ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living can also affect med- ication regimens. For example, a person whodoes not drive a car may not be able to get med-ications from the pharmacy, or a person whocannot manage money may not be able to payfor the medications. Hearing The ability to hear instructions given by thehealth care provider or pharmacist is a very im-portant part of the ability to take medicationsaccurately and safely. The older adult may have anonfunctioning hearing aid, not have their hear-ing aid in place, or be hard of hearing and haveno hearing aid to use. Thus, it is conceivable thatan older adult may not hear instructions given to Failing to obtain refills Rationing medications so as not to run out Right Route Although this might be difficult to imagine,these errors do occur. Examples of failure toadminister the medication by the right routemight include sublingual medication that isswallowed or a suppository that is chewed. Right Times Taking medications at the right times can bevery difficult for the older adult, for a multitudeof reasons such as: Having medications ordered for two, three, or even four times a day Having multiple medications ordered, each at a different time Right Patient This one should not be a problem in the home,but it is. It is not unusual for patients in thehome setting to \"try\" medications prescribed for other persons in the household. One recentexample from the authors' facility is the case of a woman hospitalized for an unusually pro-longed clotting time. It was finally deduced that she disliked the cholesterol medicationthat was prescribed for her, so she started usingher husband's cholesterol pills (which he re-fused to take). What she didn't know was thather husband's medication was notalright for her, because it interacted with the warfarin shewas taking for a heart condition, potentiatingthe anticoagulant effect and prolonging herclotting time. This type of situation is in noway unusual.28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 307 308 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values Figure 8-1 Failure to take medica- tions or attend to other healthneeds can be a sign that an olderadult lacks motivation to adhere to the medication regimen. them by the health care provider to discard all oldmedications, to take three pills a day, or to callthe doctor if they experience certain side effects. Vision Vision is another sense that is important to helpensure adherence to prescribed medication reg-imens. The ability to see to find the medicationand read the label can be the difference betweenadherence and illness. Older adults need to beable to read the literature given to them abouttheir medications, the times, dosages, and sideeffects. Reading Ability Closely associated with vision, the ability to readcan affect the medication regimen. If the patientcannot read, can read only at a grade-school level,or cannot read the language in which the instruc-tions are written, the \"five rights\" may bemissed. Often, written instructions are given tothe patient with the best of intentions, but theprovider fails to ascertain that the patient canread, and understand, the written words. Also,medication instructions are often written at ahigh school level, whereas the patient mayrequire instruction at a fifth grade level. Memory/Cognition Impaired memory can be a barrier to adherencewith medication routines. Remembering whichmedications to take and at what times can bedifficult if memory is impaired by dementia,delirium, or depression. Motivation Motivation is important in adherence to amedication routine. There must be motiva-tion to obtain the medication, to learn aboutthe medication, to take the medication ontime, and to report inability to take medi-cations to the physician. Motivation can benegatively affected by cognitive status, de-pression, and even societal or family pressures(see Figure 8-1 ). \u00a9Jones and Bartlett Publishers.

Medicare does notcover the cost of medications. Although Medi-care has recently added a medication benefit, itwill not fully cover the cost of all medications.Supplemental policies purchased by the olderadult may help to cover the cost of some med-ications. Medicaid may supply funds for a lim-ited number of medications, depending uponthe state of residence. Persons without insur-ance, Medicare, or Medicaid may be unable tofind the money to purchase needed medicationsor refills, and thus may go without. Providers also share the responsibility for the cost of medications. The more medications pre-scribed, the higher the cost. Also, new, brand-name medications cost much more than thoseavailable in a generic form. Medicare D, whichconcerns prescription benefits, will be imple-mented in early 2006, and although it maymake medications more affordable for some, ithas been forecast to make day-to-day livingmore difficult for others, due to increased dol-lars taken from monthly Social Security checksto pay for membership in the program and highdeductibles. With multiple providers of med-ications with differing formularies available forthe beneficiaries of Medicare, it is yet to be seenif this will be an efficacious program. One study found that as many as one third of the chronically ill elders who underuse prescrip-tion medications because of the cost never talk tothe providers in advance. Many never raise theissue, due to embarrassment or misinterpretationof the provider's feelings. Of those who did nottell a clinician about their inability to pay formedications, 66% reported that no one even askedthem about their ability to pay for the prescribeddrugs, and 58% thought that the providers couldnot help them with funding issues. Of those whodid talk to their provider about financial con-cerns, 31% reported that they were not offeredless expensive alternatives, 30% were not giveninformation about potential funding sources, and28% were not given advice on pharmacies thatcould provide medications for less money (Piette,Heisler, & Wagner, 2004). Nursing Interventions Nurses in all settings have a responsibility tohelp ensure that the five rights are followed for each patient. Specific interventions shouldinclude: Medication review: This can take place in the outpatient or the inpatient setting.Ask the patient to bring in all of his orher medications, including over-the-counter (OTC) medications, for review.Compare patient medications to themedical records. Ensure that medica-tions no longer prescribed are discarded.Discard any expired medications. Bealert for medications ordered by differ-ent providers. Inform the physician ofany concerns. See Table 8-6 for further information on medication review. Education: Ensure that the patient or the person who administers the medicationsto the patient thoroughly understandsmedication instructions. Provide themwith a clearly written list that includes:Name of the medication: Include both brand name and generic name. Schedule of administration: Do not include medical terms such as qid,qd, or bid. Instead, write out \"threetimes a day\" or other instructions.28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 309 310 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values Dosage: Clearly write out the dosage in full words, such as 10 milligramsor three pills. Instruct them in howto measure out the correct dose of themedication. Side effects to report: Instruct the patient about adverse drug reactionsand when to seek medical help. Besure that the patient knows to whomto report adverse drug reactions. Evaluation of education: Ask the patient or caregiver to repeat and/orread back instructions you have giventhem. Ask if they have any questions.Provide them the number of someonethey can call if they have questionsabout their medications. Accommodation: Note sensory, motor, or cognitive limitations that the patientmay have that would interfere with hisor her understanding of medicationinstructions or ability to administer themedications. Ensure glasses and hearingaids are on and in place before educatingabout medications. Use large print writ-ten resources if necessary. Ask for spe-cially adapted lids on pill bottles fromthe pharmacy to help facilitate openinglids. For example, Target corporationhas redesigned the ordinary pill bottle,making it color coded for each familymember, flattening the bottle so thelabel is easier to read, including a slotfor patient instructions, and having aspot to hold oral syringes for liquidmedications (see Figure 8-2) . Obtain weekly pillboxes that can be filled by ahealth care provider every week. Helpthe patient investigate the high-techoptions on the market to help improveadherence: prompting devices such asbeeping pillboxes and talking watches,electronic medication vials, and hand-held electronic organizers (McGarryLogue, 2002). Obtain referrals for homehealth nurses for medication assistanceand monitoring for persons with severemobility or cognitive deficits. Ask theordering provider to try to limit thenumber and frequency of medications.Occupational therapists and socialworkers can assist in addressing thesetypes of accommodations. Funding: Assess the patient's ability to pay for medications\u2014Medicare,Medicaid, supplemental plans, and out-of-pocket expenses. Consult a socialworker to help with finding fundingsources, if necessary. Ask the orderingprovider to try to limit the number ofTable 8-6 Tips for Medication Review The following tips may serve as a format to use when doing a medication history: Current prescription medications Current over-the-counter and herbal medications, and frequencies Social drug use (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, caffeine) Home remedies Drug allergies Compliance assessment Medication administration (need for special devices, patient's mental status, caregiver administration)28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 310 A Brief Overview of Some Medications Used by Older Adults 311 different medications, and to use cheaper,generic medications where possible. A Brief Overview ofSome Medications Usedby the Older Adult Population There is not enough space in this chapter toreview all medications used by the elderly pop-ulation, so just three of the more commonlyused medication categories will be presented.The reader is referred to the resource list forinformation on other medications commonlyprescribed for older adults. Medications for Dementia There are several new drugs on the market fordementia. Although there is as yet no cure, thesemedications help to slow the progress of the dis-ease. Four medications are commonly used inpatients with symptoms of the brain's lev-els of acetylcholine, to restore communicationbetween brain cells. Acetylcholine is thought tobe important for memory and thinking. Benefitsof these medications tend to occur at higherdoses; unfortunately, higher doses have an in-creased likelihood of side effects (ElderCare On-line, 2002; Health-cares.net, 2005). Aricept is probably the most widely used drug. Although it does not cure Alzheimer's or keep itfrom getting worse, it does help relieve some ofthe memory loss. It is most effective in the earlystages of the disease. The dosage is typically 5 mgper day to start, increasing to 10 mg, once a day.Side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea,fatigue, insomnia, and weight loss (ElderCareOnline, 2002; Health-cares.net, 2005). Cognex is taken four times a day, has mod- est benefits, and does not work in patients withthe ApoE4 gene. Cognex can potentially affectthe liver, so liver enzymes must be closely mon-itored. Side effects of Cognex include nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, andindigestion. NSAIDs must be used with cautionin combination with this drug (ElderCareOnline, 2002; Health-cares.net, 2005). stimulates nicotinic receptors toFigure 8-2 Newly designed medication bottle from Target corporation.

It istaken twice a day. Side effects may include nau-sea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. Someantidepressants and other drugs with anticholin-ergic side effects may cause retention of Reminylin the body. NSAIDs should be used with cau-tion in combination with this drug (ElderCareOnline, 2002). Exelon is given twice a day. It works by pre- venting the breakdown of acetylcholine andbutyrylcholine in the brain. Side effects mayinclude nausea, vomiting, weight loss, upsetstomach, and muscle weakness. NSAIDs shouldbe used with caution in combination with thisdrug. Because these four drugs work in a similar way, switching from one drug to another is notexpected to improve the outcome. One medica-tion or another may, however, be better toleratedwith fewer side effects. A fifth approved medication is an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist. Memantine(Namenda) is prescribed for the treatment ofmoderate Alzheimer's disease. It was approvedfor use in the United States in 2003. It reducesthe abnormally high levels of glutamate associ-ated with Alzheimer's-type dementia. The maineffect is to slow progression from moderate tosevere Alzheimer's disease. The prime advantagemay be to maintain certain ADL functions a lit-tle longer, and thus maintain independence anddecrease caregiver stress (Alzheimer's DiseaseEducation and Referral [ADEAR], 2005). NSAIDs are currently being studied for their usefulness in slowing the progression ofAlzheimer's, as are vitamin E and gingko biloba.Box 8-2 Resource List A listing of all indigent over 900 of Consultant Pharmacists: http://www.ascp.comBest Practices in Nursing Care to Older Adults from the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing: http://www.hartfordign.org/publications/trythis/issue16.pdf Geriatric Assessment: http://medinfo.ufl.edu/cme/geri/glossary.html#CGAThe http://www.ismp.org/Nursing Guidelines Clearinghouse: http://www.guidelines.govRxassist, a program subsidized by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, serves as an inter- mediary between patients who need medications and the pharmaceutical industry'spatient assistance programs: www.rxassist.org RxList (The Internet Drug Index): http://www.rxlist.com28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 312 baseline. Another study showed that alen-dronate reduced the risk of hip fracture by 51%(ADAM, 2002; Kessel, 2004). Etidronate(Didronel) is an older biphosphonate and is also taken bymouth. Ibandronate (Boniva) was recentlyapproved for use in the United States, but is notyet available for clinical use. Pamidronate(Aredia) is an injectable biphosphonate, as arezoledronic acid (Zometa) and ibandronate.These injectable forms do not cause GI distressas may the oral drugs. Investigative biphospho-nates include clodronate and tiludronate(ADAM, 2002). The National Osteoporosis Foundation's guidelines recommend that women with abelow-normal bone density (of 2.5 SD orgreater) and who have no history of fracturesshould take biphosphonates. They recommendconsideration of biphosphonates for womenwith below-normal bone density (of 1 SD ormore) with a history of fractures. Alendronatehas been approved for use in men with osteo-porosis; alendronate and risedronate are alsoapproved for men and women taking cortico-steroids. Side effects of this category of drugsinclude chest pain, heartburn, difficulty swal-lowing, and ulcers (ADAM, 2002). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in- creases bone density. HRT consists of estrogenwith or without progesterone. It also appears toimprove balance and protect against falling.When women stop taking HRT, bone densitydecreases, and after 5 years off of HRT all pro-tection is lost. Thus, to be of benefit, HRTneeds to be taken for life, which is contraindi-cated due to increased risk for invasive breastcancer, ovarian cancer, heart attacks, strokes, andblood clots. A 2002 study of HRT (the Wo-men's Health Initiative) was stopped before itsA Brief Overview of Some Medications Used by Older Adults 313 Estrogen's effects on Alzheimer's are also ofinterest to researchers. Selegilene, an anti-Parkinson's drug, appears to slow the onset ofAlzheimer's through an antioxidant effect(ADEAR, 2005; Health-cares.net, 2005). Medications for Osteoporosis Prevention of osteoporosis is vital in the olderadult. Osteoporosis makes the older personmore susceptible to fractures and changes pos-ture, thus placing strain and stress on musclesand joints, and it can even affect height. Thereare two main types of drugs used for preventionand treatment of osteoporosis: antiresorptivesand anabolic, or bone-forming, agents. Antiresorptives slow the rate of bone remod- eling, but cannot rebuild bone. Medications inthis category therapy, and selective estrogen-receptor modulators Anabolic, agents rebuild are parathyroid hormone and fluoride. Biphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity (bone resorption), increase bone mass, and areone of the front line classes of drugs for pre-venting osteoporosis in postmenopausal womenand in persons taking corticosteroids or estro-gen-suppressing medications. They reduce therisk of both hip and spine fractures. This classincludes alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate(Actonel). Both of these drugs are taken bymouth and should be taken in the morning withplain water, on an empty stomach. Once weeklydosing is possible with both. Studies have doc-umented reduction of hip fracture with thesetwo medications. In one study of 9,331 women,risedronate was found to reduce the 3-year riskof hip fracture by 40% in women with con-firmed osteoporosis, and by 60% in a group ofwomen with confirmed vertebral fractures at28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 313 314 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values scheduled conclusion due to the emergence ofthese bad outcomes in some women on long-term HRT (ADAM, 2002; Kessel, 2004). Some drugs have been specially designed to provide the same benefits on bone as HRT with-out increasing the risk of include raloxifene (Evista), which hasbeen approved for prevention of spinal fractures.Raloxifene is also indicated for the preventionand treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.Tamoxifen (Nolvadex) may reduce the risk forfractures, but has not been approved for this use.This medication causes increased risk for uter-ine cancer and blood clots, so its use for osteo-porosis may be in question. Tibolone (Livial) isbeing used in Europe for improving bone den-sity, especially in the lower spine, with minimalside effects. More study is required on SERMsbefore they may be deemed useful in the largerpopulation (ADAM, 2002; Kessel, 2004). Calcitonin also inhibits osteoclastic activity. is available as a nasal spray (Miacalcin) orinjectable (Calcimar). It is used to treat osteo- porosis, unlike the above drugs. It may be aviable alternative for those unable to takebiphosphonates or SERMs. It also appears torelieve bone pain associated with osteoporosisand fracture. Side effects include headache,dizziness, nausea, anorexia, rash, and edema.The nasal spray can membranes(ADAM, 2002; Kessel, 2004). Parathyroid hormone in low, intermittent doses can stimulate bone production. It is indi-cated for use in postmenopausal women who areat high risk for fracture (history of fracture, mul-tiple risk factors for fracture, or intolerant ofother treatments). The benefits may persist afterthe injections have been stopped. Teriparatide(Forteo) has been approved for treatment ofosteoporosis in postmenopausal women, but isnot yet approved for men. Side effects includenausea, dizziness, and leg cramps (ADAM,2002). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce hip fracture risk. One study of 3,270women found that 18 months of daily therapywith 1.2 g calcium and 800 IU of vitamin Dproduced a 43% reduction in hip fracture com-pared to placebo. Calcium and vitamin D alsohave been shown to improve femoral neck bonemineral density and reduce the incidence ofnonvertebral fractures in both men and women.These two drugs are notconsidered to be ade- quate for prevention of fracture in high-riskwomen (ADAM, 2002; Kessel, 2004). Several other medications are being studied for their usefulness in osteoporosis. Theseinclude osteoprotegerin, which prevents bonebreakdown by regulating osteoclasts. VitaminD being studied, as arestatins, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), tes-tosterone, and strontium. Medications for Anxiety Several drugs are used to manage anxiety in theolder adult. These drugs are appropriate whenthere is a clear diagnosis of anxiety disorder anda poor response to alternative therapies. As withany medication for the aged, it is recommendedthat the practitioner start low (dosage) and goslow (make changes slowly). Benzodiazepines have a long history of use in this age group. Many elders have long-term pre-scriptions for benzodiazepines such as Valium.In 2003, 18.7% of Texas nursing facility resi-dents age 65 or older were taking benzodi-azepines, one fifth of which were long-actingbenzodiazepines (Quality Matters, 2004). Long-acting benzodiazepines, however, should be usedwith great caution in the older adult, due to the28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 314 Conclusion 315 long half-life changes in the metabolismand excretion of drugs. Short-acting benzodi-azepines can be substituted and should be limitedto less than 4 months' use. Short-acting ben-zodiazepines include lorazepam and oxazepam.Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines havebeen reported in the elderly. Symptoms includeirritability, anger, and loss of control (Lantz,2003). Benzodiazepine tapering and withdrawalcan be a difficult process and is usually doneover 6-12 weeks. Withdrawal symptoms arecommon and often difficult to differentiate fromanxiety symptoms (Gliatto, 2000). As men-tioned earlier in this chapter, benzodiazepinesare on the Beers list of inappropriate drugs inthe elderly. Although short-acting benzodi-azepines may be used short term for immediaterelief of symptoms, they are typically used untilthe slower-onset medications have begun toshow an effect. Buspirone can help manage anxiety, does not lead to cognitve impairment, and has no addic-tive potential or sedative effect. It can cause par-adoxical agitation in persons with dementia, andit may actually worsen symptoms of cognitveimpairment. Persons who have used benzodi-azepines extensively in the past are unlikely tobenefit from buspirone. Buspirone can take 3-5weeks before maximal effect seen (Aparasu,Mort, & Aparasu, 2001; Quality Matters, 2004). Antidepressants may be used as a first line treatment of anxiety disorders in older adults,particularly the selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs). Long-term use of SSRIs foranxiety has SSRIs com-monly fluvoxamine, fluoxetine,sertraline, and paroxetine. SSRIs used for anxi-ety are prescribed at a lower dose than whenused for depression. One drawback to use ofSSRIs for anxiety is the length of time to onsetof relief\u2014it may take weeks for the effects tobegin. Paroxetine, which has anticholinergiceffects, should be used with caution in the el-derly (Quality Matters, 2004). Anxiety medications must be used with cau- tion in the older adult. Any medication thataffects cognition (thinking), memory, or balanceand gait is a safety concern in this population. Conclusion Nurses have a unique opportunity to partnerwith older adults and to contribute to the suc-cess of prescribed medication regimens. Thebiopsychosocial effects of aging can negativelyaffect the success of a medication routine; nurseshave the knowledge and ability to counteractmany of these effects in conjunction with thehealth care team. Table 8-7 provides a summary of the key concepts related to medications andthe older adult. Don't be afraid to take the lead in reviewing a patient's medications, screening for inappro-priate prescriptions, recommending alterna-tives, and educating the older adult onmedications. You may be the only barrierbetween an older adult and an adverse drugreaction.28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 315 316 Chapter 8: Medications and Laboratory Values Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Mr. Lockwood, a 102-year-old man, is admitted to the hospital from home with a diagnosis of hypotension and dizziness. He lives at home with his grandson, who,Mr. Lockwood says, is gone most of the time. You notice that Mr. Lockwood takesat least 10 different medications. What are your concerns for medication compli-ance with this patient? 2. Ms. Adams is a geriatric patient who you see in your rounds for a home health agency. You are suspicious that something is wrong, because she continues to com-plain of back pain, although pain medications have been prescribed. When youcheck her pill bottle, it is empty. You call the pharmacy, who says that that pre-scription for 60 pills was filled last week. How might you respond to this situa-tion? Which health care professionals might be of assistance in clarifying the issue? 3. Mrs. Young lives alone in her house. She is 87 years old, and you suspect that she has dementia. Mrs. Young refuses to allow health care workers into her home.When you assist with discharge planning from the acute care hospital for Mrs.Young, you become worried because you doubt that she will take her medicationsproperly. What resources are available to help Mrs. Young have a safe discharge?Table 8-7 Key Concepts in Geriatric Pharmacology Older adults make up about 13% of the population, but consume 33% of all prescription medications. Older adults have significant physiological changes related to aging that may interfere with medications. The elderly are more sensitive to the effects of drug therapy. Adverse drug reactions are any noxious, unintended, or undesired effect of a drug that occurs at doses in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy. Certain disease states may interfere with optimal drug therapy. Polypharmacy is defined as the prescription, administration, or use of more medications than are clinically indicated for a patient. Inappropriate prescribing may be very harmful to elderly persons. Compliance to drug regimens is essential to improving medical diagnosis and outcomes.28438_CH08_293_320.qxd 6/6/06 5:12 PM Page 316 Glossary 317 Absorption: Movement of drugs from the point of entry into the body into the bloodstream.

Think about the medications that you have administered to older adults during your time as a nursing student or nurse. How often have you considered drug interactionsand the importance of therapeutic levels in the elderly? How important is it to drawpeak and trough levels at the correct time? 2.

Health, personality, state ofmind, and emotional, physical, and spiritual sup-port all have a place in the adjustments onemakes to the aging process. Although self-care and health promotion are indeed important inmaintaining independence, aging and accom- panying health factors often make this a very dif-ficult period of life. As a person moves from theearlier adjustments of aging (65-75 years) to thelater ones (75-85 /H11001years), circumstances may become even more complex. Although level ofphysical activity tends to decrease with aging,\"many older people can maintain health throughsocial, intellectual, and cultural activities\" (Fone& Lundgren-Lundquist, 2003, p. 1051). Although it is important, high functional ability is not absolutely necessary for high quality of life . Because many elderly have chronic disabilities, it is important to recognizethis distinction and find ways to maximizequality of life through other means\u2014includingspirituality, social engagement, environment,and connection\u2014in addition to physical activ-ity programs (Johansson, 2003). Successful aging has been defined as \"the ability to maintain three key behaviors: low riskof disease and disease-related disability, highmental and physical function, and active en-gagement of life\" (Rowe & Kahn, 1998, p. 3).This chapter will discuss the factors that influ-ence these behaviors. The case study interspersedthroughout this chapter follows the story of onecouple in transition. Bessie and Sadie, the \"Delany Sisters,\" are famous for remaining physically and mentallyactive into their second century. They experi-enced being on the best-seller book list, televi-sion talk shows, and national notoriety\u2014all afterthey became 101 and 103 years of age, respec-tively! Their comments, advice, and wisdom arequoted periodically throughout this chapter toillustrate their attitudes about living fully. \"No matter how old you get, youthink of yourself as young. In ourdreams, we are always young.\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, p. 40) \"Most folks think getting older meansgiving up, not trying anything new.Well, we don't agree with that. As longas you can see each day as a chance forsomething new to happen, somethingyou never experienced before, you willstay young . . . even after a everything.We've only just started.\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, p. 11) Maintaining Independence Influences of Environment and Living Situation \"So we do our little bit. Gettinginvolved is satisfying. It keeps us busyand makes us useful. Everyone hassomething to contribute!\" \u2014Bessie Delany (1994, p. 90) Maintaining maximum independence while maintaining maximum quality of life is a bal-ance sought by the elderly, their caregivers, andsociety in general. Aspects of achieving this bal-ance are often in conflict with each other, and28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 322 Maintaining Independence 323 are certainly affected by many factors involvedin the aging process. Any evaluation of quality of life should include the perceptions of the person being eval-uated. Even those with dementia are able toidentify mood state, at times with more accu-racy than their caregivers. Consideration of thewhole person is important, and in so doing, theinterdisciplinary team gains importance indeveloping evaluations, methods, and interven-tions (Johansson, 2003). Living SkillsRemaining in the community for as long as pos-sible is the goal for most Americans, so it isimportant to be able to evaluate the ability of theperson to remain safely in the community whilehaving his or her needs met in an appropriatemanner. Such an evaluation might utilize theKohlman Evaluation of Living Skills (KELS),which has been adapted for the geriatric popula-tion and is commonly administered by occupa-tional therapists. It assesses 17 daily living skills under five categories\u2014self-care, safety and health,money management, transportation and tele-phone use, and work and leisure (Zimnavoda,Weinblatt, & Katz, 2002). Other evaluationsthat can help determine aspects of appropriate-ness for independent/community living includethe Routine Task Inventory (RTI), the Func-tional Independence Measure (FIM), and theMini Mental State Examination (MMSE), whichscreens for dementia\u2014and against which theKELS was tested and compared. Having practical, realistic, and nonsubjective evaluation tools would likely improve theelderly person's ability to identify and reconcilethe need for more care, and would certainly helpfamilies who are struggling to identify the levelof assistance required by their elderly relatives.For example, a simple evaluation of the abilityto use the telephone may help determine theappropriateness of a person to remain in thecommunity. Tested on persons living alone witha dementia diagnosis, a study found that if aperson is unable to reply to a letter requestinga call and if they are unable to use the telephonebook, home-alone safety must be questioned.Continuous \"practice\" in calling frequently usednumbers (of family or caregivers) may help for awhile, but when a person who lives alone cannotcall for assistance or health care, and when evensocial communication by telephone has becometoo demanding to cope with, the safety risks ofliving alone must be considered (Nygard &Starkhammar, 2003). Housing InfluencesThe word home holds special meanings, usually associated with familiarity as well as security,stability, feelings and memories, a sense of per-sonal identity, and a place where we are in con-trol and have choices. Moving from home toanother setting may precipitate a loss of thesespecial meanings and may be a very difficultadjustment\u2014especially if the person is not apart of the planning, decision making, and dis-tribution of belongings. When a move is seen as\"something better,\" adjustment is easier. Whenit is due to disability and/or the need for addi-tional care, the multiple losses of friends, inde-pendence, and control must be acknowledgedand grieved. Health care workers and familymembers need to understand and acknowledgethe person's feelings about all these issues andprovide assistance and support throughout theadjustment (White, 2003). Housing choices are greatly influenced by the socioeconomic status and resources of the elderlyperson. Individuals with more access to qualityhealth care often have better functional abilitiesand longer life expectancies (Stupp, 2000).28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 323 324 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life Better functional ability and income then affectthe number of options and types of livingchoices available to meet the needs of theelderly, which may, in turn, impact their health.Those with limited incomes may not be able toafford some of the choices that might lead to ahealthier living environment. Housing options include: One's own home Family/relative's home Senior living complexes/continuing care retirement communities Assisted living Paid caregiver homes\u2014licensed or unlicensed Extended care facilities Carefully designed and implemented retire- ment communities address the concerns andfeelings of displacement that moving from one'shome to the unfamiliarity of new surroundingsengenders. Some communities provide housing,community life, socialization, transportation,and health care for the elderly. Easily accessibleon-site services\u2014which might include recre-ational activities, social services, spiritual sup-port, banking, and health care\u2014provide acontinuum of care that offers an opportunity to\"age in place.\" Other care needs are met withadditional services as the needs manifest them-selves. Some communities include assisted liv-ing and extended care facilities within thecommunity itself. These communities usuallyrequire payment of fees and monthly servicecharges (Reicherter & Billek-Sawhney, 2003). For those who can afford them, retirement communities offer a certain freedom from thestresses of family care, while offering additionalsecurity from the risks of neighborhood living.Compared to older people living in the localneighborhood, the retirement community pop-ulation in one study better maintained theirphysical and mental health. Peer support, safetyand security, and autonomy with inclusion wereimportant factors in maintaining health status.Age-specific shared living can also contribute toenhanced morale while serving as an antidote toage-related prejudice (Kingston, Bernard, Biggs,& Nettleton, 2001). Self-Care \"I'd say one of the most importantqualities to have is the ability to createjoy in your life. . . . I love my gardenso much that I would stay out there allday long if Sadie let me. That's what Imean about creating joy in your life.We all have to do it for ourselves.\" \u2014Bessie Delany (1994, pp. 32-33). Maintaining interests or developing new ones isa measure of satisfactory aging. Learning, grow-ing, creating, and enjoying are some of theessential outcomes for measurement of success-ful aging. Satisfaction and personal growth tran-scend developmental stages, and are dependenton the individual's prior interests, ability tofocus on new interests, and availability of andaccess to additional resources. For the elderly person with the capacity for activities of some kind, doing for others isanother way to measure satisfactory aging.Altruism is high in the elderly; charity givingis proportionately higher for older than foryounger age groups (Ebersole & Hess, 1998).Volunteering in various capacities is anotherway the older person can contribute to his or hercommunity\u2014through peer support, church ac-tivities, even maintenance of a small area of anextended care facility. One lady ran a small giftshop of donated items for an hour or two per dayin her facility. Another brought her pet bird to28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 324 Maintaining Independence 325 visit the residents. These small gestures wereactivities well within the capabilities of mobil-ity-limited women, but brought them pleasureand contributed to the morale of others as well. A Canadian study suggests that a uniform concept of frailty, relevant to older adults, wouldhave important policy implications, and couldimprove the planning and distribution of ser-vices to those who would benefit. The study rec-ommends a uniform theoretical approach that ismultidimensional (not age-related), subjectivelydefined, and includes both individual and envi-ronmental factors (Fried et al., 2001). Frailty is perceived as a general decline in the physical function of older adults that can increasevulnerability to illness and decline. Definingcharacteristics include unintentional weight lossof more than 10% in the prior year, feelings ofexhaustion, grip strength in the weakest 20% forage, walking speed in the lowest 20% for age,and low caloric expenditure ( /H11021270 kcal) per week on physical activity. Neither age nor dis-ability alone makes a person frail, but changesthat often occur with age may contribute signif-icantly to its presence. At nearly every age past65, women commonly experience frailty at agreater percentage than men (Fried et al., 2001). Harvard Women's Health Watch (Forestalling Frailty, 2003) suggests several steps that can betaken to prevent or interrupt the course of frailty: Maintain a healthy weight and diet Stay active Practice fall prevention Make connections\u2014maintain relation- ships with others See medical personnel regularly\u2014 physician, eye doctor, dentist \"Some people, older people especially,tend to draw into themselves . . . theygrow isolated. That's a big mistake!You never know when you might needother people, but you need to earn theirhelp. You have to contribute to yourcommunity.\" \u2014Bessie Delany (1994, p. 89) Role Changes/Transitions Multiple role changes occur over the course ofone's life, and that is no different for the elderly.Changes are sometimes affected by choice, but asone ages, the role changes and transitions mayincreasingly occur outside the control of the indi-vidual. They may be abrupt, crisis-oriented, andundesired, or there may be some time and oppor-tunity for adjustment to the change. Some changesmay be very subtle, with a slow shift from one self-concept to another\u2014mostly recognized after thefact. Past skills and a series of adaptations may pre-pare for some transitions\u2014like the primary shiftfrom parenting to grandparenting\u2014making themsmoother and less stressful. But the shift fromfunctional independence to functional dependenceand from health to illness crosses many aspects oflife, and likely requires a series of transitionaladjustments. These transitions require the free-dom of the individual to try various possibilities,as within any other stage of life. Exploration andindependence in making adjustments should beencouraged (Ebersole & Hess, 1998). RetirementRetirement is perhaps one of the most commonrole changes faced by the aging. This is an oc-currence that either can be planned for andanticipated, may be sudden and unexpected re-lated to illness or injury, or may present alongsome continuum between the two. Some peo-ple find a lack of purpose and fulfillment withthis transition, whereas others feel a new senseof personal freedom and time for activities28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 325 326 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life postponed during busier years. Some addition-ally find their availability tempered with theneed to provide care to those around them,whether older or younger. Some make the choice to continue to work past \"retirement age\" because of financial neces-sity, enjoyment of the challenge, socialization, aneed for structure, or for the status inherent in thework role. Others, who retire unwillingly, may beat greater risk for unsuccessful adjustments\u2014including alcoholism, depression, and suicide.These people are perhaps likely to seek medical ing support to increase the efficacy of hermedication because of Bill's lack of faithin the counseling process and his activeridicule when she attempted it. At the age of 68, Marge was diag- nosed with breast cancer. When theirlong-time family physician retired theday after her diagnosis, she decided toseek active treatment with an oncologistfriend of her daughter who lived inApex, 3 hours away in the next state.Considerable trust in the physician andability to maintain some independencein the familiarity of their travel trailerparked in a daughter's driveway madethis decision possible. She underwent aleft mastectomy at the hospital in Apex. Critical Thinking: As the discharge nurse at the hospital, what factors influ-ence your suggestions for follow-upprotocols/procedures? Consider the tra-ditional release instructions; patient tobe 150 miles from the physician withphysical assistance from her husband;and the family being less accessible dueto distance.Bill retired at age 65 from a major corporation, where he had been an engi-neer specializing in materials testing andacquisition for the company's product.Marge was a homemaker, who workedpart time in her church office and a giftshop after their four children weregrown and left the house. Bill and Margewere raised during the Depression years,and had developed frugal living andfinancial habits, which enabled them toacquire a sufficient nest egg for theirretirement and later years. They physically worked hard together over the years in building their dreamhome on a small lake, valuing indepen-dence and self-sufficiency as very impor-tant quality-of-life indicators. Theirrelationship of 50 years was frequentlycontentious, and they often quarreled orverbally sparred as a mode of commu-nication. They were, however, quitecommitted to each other and Marge didnot consider a life without Bill. Margehad been medicated for years for treat-ment of depression, but had not takenadvantage of the recommended counsel- Case Study 9-128438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 326 Maintaining Independence 327 intervention, but may not recognize the under-lying depression. Health TransitionThe transition from health to illness involveschanges in lifestyle, self-concept, and perhaps alost sense of value and relationships. It is also achange that may occur very subtly, over time,with the development of chronic conditions ofincreasing disability. Or it may have a suddenonset with a precipitating medical event. Loss of SpouseLoss of a spouse provides a profound role change,with numerous transitions. Women who arewidowed commonly experience anxiety and fearin the first few years after their loss. Losing thepartner of a long, close, and satisfying relation-ship may feel like the loss of self and one's \"core.\"Even those widows who successfully reorganizetheir lives and invest in family, friends, andactivities find they still profoundly miss their\"other half.\" A new identity, with autonomyand individuation, are often products of a suc-cessful adaptation to widowhood. This adapta-tion may or may not include remarriage. Long-term relationships that were markedly unsatisfying may result in a degree of complicatedmourning for the widow or widower, accompa-nied by guilt, anger, or perhaps relief that the rela-tionship has ended. The potential exists that theremaining partner may find other outlets for thenegativity he or she expressed in the relationship,or that he or she may not have the self-confidenceor ability for independent decision making be-cause of a long history of domination by the other.This will likely affect their roles with their fami-lies or other support systems. Generally speaking, men who are widowed often hide their grief in a distorted concept of\"manliness,\" in which they carry their painalone. Until recent years, society has not givenmen the same explicit permission to grieve asit had afforded to women. Widowers seem to cially by the nausea and vomitingepisodes that cumulatively increasedwith each treatment. Nearing the end ofthe scheduled treatments, she was beg-ging to forego the last one. Critical Thinking: As the oncologist's office nurse, how would you respond toMarge's family who called, relating hertearful refusal to submit to the lastchemo treatment, and requesting youradvice?Marge's treatment over the next year consisted of 6 months of chemotherapy,CT scans, oncology appointments. SoonMarge and Bill would travel with theirtrailer to Apex for each course of treat-ment as it was scheduled, stay a few daysin their daughter's driveway after treat-ment, and then return to their ownhome, where Bill cared for her until hertreatment reactions subsided. Marge wasdevastated by her hair loss, and espe- Case Study 9-228438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 327 328 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life pay less attention to themselves, lose social con-tacts, and can experience an erosion of self-confidence and sexuality. Widower status inelderly men has been found to be a risk factor forincreased dependency in activities of daily liv-ing (ADLs) and mobility (van den Brink, 2004).Some men tend to reinvest in new relationshipsin search of the lost mate, before reconciling tothe death of their spouse. Becoming more common for the elderly, divorce can force a change in roles. The necessityto grieve is similar for this change in role, andmay be more devastating if it is unanticipated.There are major individual and generational dif-ferences in the expectations for marriage, buteven older couples are becoming less likely toremain in unsatisfactory relationships (Ebersole& Hess, 1998). Individuals with few family or social supports have a more difficult time adjusting to the lossof a spouse than do those with information aboutthe grief process, sufficient support, and permis-sion and time to experience fully their grief.Role ReversalRole reversal with a spouse or adult childrenoften occurs for the aging person, as the eldermoves from care provider to care recipientthrough the course of aging. When a very strongand independent elder experiences failing health,the transition to dependency may drain theenergies of both the provider and the recipientwho are part of the role reversal. If a spouse oradult child is a rather passive or dependent per-son, they may need considerable help in adjust-ing to the transitions (Ebersole & Hess, 1998). while they wintered in Florida, and wasable to rehab and resume her routine ofwalking several miles per day. This exer-cise not only allowed her to be out in thenatural beauty of the location, which shecherished, but also kept her in shape andstimulated her ability to sleep better atnight, as well as providing some separa-tion from Bill for several hours each day. During one winter away, Bill was examined for cardiac dysrythmia and pal-pitations, was diagnosed with tachycar-dia, and was given medications to controlthe symptoms he experienced. Theyreturned to life at their home by the lakeBill and Marge celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a wig and alarge party of family, extended family,and friends on the lawn of their belovedlake house. They were able to travel intheir trailer for a number of years, evenrenting their house out for a few years.They spent their time wintering in thesouth, visiting various family membersduring the summers, and taking extendedtravel trips with their travel association.They carried their medical records withthem and were treated as needed in thelocations where they spent the most time. Marge had large toe joint replacement Case Study 9-328438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 328 Maintaining Independence 329 Some older persons may enjoy the dependency of their failing health and can create burdens fortheir families and caregivers. Their demandingpersonalities and failure to maximize their re-maining independence can tax the strength,resources, and patience of their caregivers. DrivingDriving a car is an area of independence withstrong emotional and psychological implica-tions, in addition to those of physical capacity.It represents the ability to maintain connectionsand contribute to the community (Silverstein etal., 2004). Dementia, use of some medications,fractures, cardiac conditions, and poor visionmay limit a person's ability to drive, and cessa-tion of driving has been shown to increasesymptoms of depression for up to 6 years(Kakaiya, Tisovec, & Fulkerson, 2000). Safe driving requires not only sound physical and mental capacity, but also alertness, the abil-ity to interpret and judge surroundings, andreports of the decline in Bill's own func-tion vs. the standardized test results. Asa result, Bill drove awhile longer, untilthe physician prohibited his drivingsome months later after more familyreports of increasing safety issues. With this forced curtailment of driv- ing, Bill became very angry, demonstrat-ing much difficulty in coping and definitegrieving. His negativity and demandingbehavior placed increased stress onMarge. He often refused to allow her todrive, making demeaning commentswhen she did. He further blamed familyconspiracy and the physician, challeng-ing suggested medical interventions andher professional judgment. Personal Reflection: As a student nurse and a college student now embarking onyour own quest for independence, canyou relate to losing a major independentactivity such as driving? Has anyone inyour family faced such a situation? Howmight you help your parents or yourgrandparents with the adjustment to giv-ing up driving, a major factor in a per-son's perception of independence?when Marge began reporting increasedconfusion in Bill, as well as expressingsome fears about his driving, also wit-nessed by one of the adult children visit-ing them for a spring break vacation. Adaughter traveled to Florida to drivethem and their travel trailer home. Billvoiced much displeasure at the daughter'sinsistence on driving\u2014insisting he was afar better driver\u2014even though his familyhad observed confusion in a major inter-section, driving the wrong way on amarked street, and other incidents. After significant family intervention, including individual conversations anda family meeting to discuss the drivingconcerns, Bill was evaluated by a physi-cian and agreed to psychological testingto determine his ability to continue driv-ing. Probably because of his propensityfor mechanics and IQ, Bill placed in thelow acceptable percentiles of the testresults for his age group and gender.However, the family questioned the testvalidity because the administrator didn'taccount for Bill's history as an engineerand did not take into account the many 28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 329 330 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life appropriate reflexes and strength for reaction.The elderly person may be experiencing declinein some of these abilities. The ultimate decisionas to whether a person should continue to driveis made by the local licensing authority, butfamilies and patients often look to their doctorfor help in determining the person's continuingfitness to drive. A number of factors influencethe evaluation of fitness to drive, as outlined inBox 9-1 . Instrumental Activities of Daily LivingInstrumental activities of daily living(IADLs) , such as cleaning and cooking, shop- ping, running errands, keeping appointments,maintaining the checkbook, and paying bills,may require the assistance of others. Access tothese opportunities is often limited by func-tional limitations\u2014sometimes briefly, as dur-ing convalescence from a surgery or temporarydisability. Sometimes a precipitating event oradvancing illness makes these role changesmore permanent. Basic Activities of Daily LivingBasic activities of daily living (BADLs) in- volve personal care, such as bathing, dressing,and feeding. The need for assistance in theseactivities usually comes subsequent to theneed for help with IADLs, unless there is aprecipitating factor that causes the need. Asphysical abilities decrease, need for assistanceincreases.CaregivingAs a person requires more and more assistancewith IADLs and BADLs, issues of caregiving escalate. At times, the need for caregiver assis-tance arises long before acceptance of that care.Some elderly may resist recognition of the needfor help because that very need exemplifies theirincreasing limitations and the inability to main-tain their independence. Family members mayalso resist recognizing the need, not wanting todiminish the dignity and freedom of choice fortheir loved one.Box 9-1 Evaluation Factors of Fitness to Drive Crash rates per mile driven Modification of driving (e.g., fewer miles driven per month; limiting driv-ing to familiar roads, daytime hours, orgood weather conditions) Driving history (e.g., getting lost in familiar surroundings, near misses, nearcrashes, traffic violation tickets) Medication use Visual faculties needed for safe driving (e.g., contraction of visual fields,decline in resistance to glare) Cognition assessment instruments (e.g., Mini Mental State Examination,Washington Clinical Rating Scale) On-road test by driver's licensing authority Effect of terminating patient's right to drive Source: Kakaiya, R., et al.

He did not acknowledge that themedicine had managed his symptomsfor several years. It further bolstered hisresistance to obtaining medical care forhimself while at the same time negatingthe care Marge was seeking and receiv-ing for her Parkinson's diagnosis andincreasing depression. Living in their hometown placed Bill and Marge 150-250 miles from any oftheir four adult children. At the ages of78 and 73, they reluctantly made thedecision to give up their dream home of40 years. Their long-time circle offriends was gradually shrinking. Theywere no longer able to maintain the rig-orous maintenance schedule for theirtoo-large house, and they were experi-encing increased physical problems.Although Bill did not perceive the needfor himself, he was able to accommo-date the decision \"for Marge's sake,\"recognizing she would need increasinghelp as time passed and her Parkinson'sprogressed. Marge looked forward tobeing nearer three of her four children,and in actual proximity to two of them.Bill and Marge sold their home andinvested in a condominium near Apex,between two of their daughters. They also developed their estate plan, completed advance directives, andWithin several years, Marge was diag- nosed with Parkinson's disease in itsearly stages and experienced an increasein her depression, anticipating theexpected progressive nature of the dis-ease and demonstrating her fear of amuch reduced quality of life. She wasembarrassed by the shaking symptoms,and tended to isolate herself\u2014decliningsome dinner and other outing invitationsshe had previously enjoyed. This tendedto separate her from some of her long-standing friends, acquaintances, andchurch activities. It also kept her at homemore in Bill's ongoing negative presence. Bill's new physician sent him for a cardiac oblation procedure that effec-tively took care of his symptoms. Hewas able to discontinue his medicationsfor that problem, and he and his fam-ily began seeing a measure of improve-ment in his confusion and ability toconcentrate. To Bill this, of course,meant he was able to drive again, whichhe did\u2014to the trepidation of his family.In Florida for the winter once again, hereobtained permission to drive from adoctor-friend from church, who neitherinvited nor considered any family input.It also cemented in his mind his percep-tion that the doctors had erred in givinghim the cardiac medication in the first Case Study 9-4 (continues)28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 331 332 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life Bill was resistant to bathing and shaving\u2014sometimes going for morethan a week or two. He would resentand decline Marge's encouragement andoffer of help to do his personal care; heespecially resented his family's requestfor a home health aide to encourage andassist him in bathing. During this time frame, Bill and Marge's family tried a variety of ar-rangements to meet their increasingneeds, including a housekeeper everyweek, a cook three times a week to pre-pare Marge's diabetic meals, preparedmeal delivery, and aide assistance forbathing and personal care. Critical Thinking: As the visiting home care nurse, how would you ap-proach Bill regarding catheter care, per-sonal care, motivation for self-care,Marge's reports of frequent dozingwherever he was, and refusal to eat themeals arranged for by his family? Are there other possible diagnoses Bill's family should be aware of, alertedto, or educated about? What other resources may assist them in maintaining some level of inde-pendence at home, at this stage of theiraging and increasing needs? Personal Reflection: Imagine that you are 70-80 years old and must decidewhat to do with your lifetime of belong-ings, because your new location willaccommodate less than half of them.What do you take? What do you dowith the rest?discussed with their children their desireto remain in their own home throughouttheir lifetimes. They planned to bring inassistance as needed for meeting theircare needs, which they readily verbalizedwould only increase over time. In fact,their condo could accommodate a live-in caregiver with a separate bedroom,sitting area, and private bathroom. Bill was diagnosed with benign pro- state enlargement, and tested severaltimes for cancer because of his high PSAtest results and frequent leaks from hisbladder. Over a period of months he hada TURP procedure but experienced on-going difficulty urinating and retention, necessitating Foley catheterplacement. His urologist ordered homenursing for catheter care and teachingrelated to its use. While insisting onbeing largely independent with day-to-day ADLs, Bill mostly ignored his needfor bathing and grooming\u2014satisfied towear the same clothes until Marge cap-tured them for the laundry. He couldempty his catheter bag by himself, but heapparently did not comprehend the needfor clean technique when handling thecatheter. When the home care nurse vis-ited, Marge reported to her that he oftenlet the bag drag by the catheter tubingbehind him on the floor when he walkedthrough the house, while he sat at thekitchen table, or went to bed.

Wehave different folks who do differentthings for us\u2014like give us a ride, goto the post office, or buy our vitamins.By spreading out these little favors,we're not a big burden on anyone.\"\u2014Sadie and Bessie Delany (1994, p. 126) A broad spectrum of caregiving options is available when unassisted independent living isno longer possible or appropriate: Independent living with help: Cooks, com- panions, cleaning service\u2014informal orformal. Family: Usually informal; live in member's home. Adult daycare at a facility: Part-time temporary assistance, frequently forrespite or while a family caregiver works;often used for persons with dementia orfor the frail elderly needing assistance orat risk for social isolation. Usual dis-charge is to assisted living or death. Adult daycare at home: Part-time respite, as above. Senior living complexes/continuing care retire-ment communities: Full range or limited services, depending on the communityand level of assistance needed; can beprogressive as needs increase. Assisted living: Homelike setting with more physical and medical care availablethan in senior complexes.Paid caregiver homes (licensed or unlicensed):Caregivers accept one or several nonrela-tives into their home to receive 24-hourassistance, especially with BADLs, on aprivate-pay basis. Extended care facilities: Skilled or inter- mediate care nursing home facilities forrehabilitation on ongoing care. Can bepaid by Medicare, Medicaid, or privatepay, depending on financial resources.Preadmission screening is usuallyrequired by the state regulatory agency. In planning and making placement for care, itis advisable to request and check references.Further discussion of these settings in relation-ship to nursing care is provided in Chapter 1. Family caregivers provide the major percentage of informal, in-home caregiving\u2014sometimes atthe cost of career advancement, and even the abil-ity to retain employment if the care needs becometoo great. Family caregivers are challenged bylack of information, lack of practical skills train-ing, and physical and emotional strain. Nurseshave the opportunity to impact the care of theirpatient by giving attention to the family care-givers, remembering that care of the person alsomeans care of the caregiver. In doing this, nursesneed to think of the family as the extension of thepatient. Several principles apply: Provide community resource information for ongoing help to thepatient/family. Offer anticipatory guidance toward practical and emotional supportresources. Respect all family caregivers. Assume they are doing the best they can underdifficult circumstances.28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 333 334 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life Help identify the strengths of the fam- ily caregivers, and point them out con-cretely; give positive reinforcement inall care settings. Help family caregivers recognize their own needs and limitations, because theymay be at risk for their own healthproblems (Reinhard, 2001). In interviews with caregivers, the nurse or interdisciplinary team member may gain addi-tional insight into the patient/caregiver situa-tion from the use of humor by caregivers. Oftenwhen relating anecdotes about various aspects ofcare, the caregiver might use humor to maskdiscomfort in talking about the issue. Use ofhumor may also provide caregivers with a face-saving way to explain thoughts and actions intheir care provider role. Humor may also pro-vide a clue that the area being discussed may bean area of unresolved conflict or concern, with-out the caregiver having to say that he or she ishaving difficulty. Sensitive probing questionsmay help identify the need for additional edu-cation, revision of treatment plan, or more prac-tical assistance for the patient and caregiver(Sparks, Travis, & Pecchioni, 2000). Patients, family members, and caregivers may also use humor as stress relief, and tolighten the load of providing care. Humor canprovide a welcome relief to the often seriousaspects of caretaking. \"Never lose your sense of humor. Thehappiest people are the ones who areable to laugh at themselves.\" \u2014Sadie and Bessie Delany (1994, p. 34) Caregiver stress may be a factor in whether a person can remain in the home setting. Caregiverswho live with their care recipient have a higherlevel of strain than those who live separately.Financial resources and/or higher education levelsdo not necessarily mean that the role strain is less-ened. The health of the caregiver is important indetermining stress levels; when the caregiver'shealth is poor in addition to that of the care recip-ient, caregiver stress is likely to be higher(Williams, Dilworth-Anderson, & Goodwin,2003). Follow-up contacts initiated by agenciesreceiving a referral for families who need assis-tance and support enhance the use of those ser-vices by the families/caregivers (McCallion,Toseland, Gerber, & Banks, 2004). Sometimes the elderly feel they have out- lived their meaning, purpose, and usefulness\u2014especially if they are debilitated and must de-pend on others for care. Ira Byock, in his book,The Four Things That Matter Most , suggests that adults tend to think their accomplishmentsshould shield them from the \"supposed indig-nity of physical dependence. \"This is an illusion,\"he states (2004, pp. 90-91). He believes thatpeople are inherently dignified, that physicaldependence does not detract from their dignity,and that people needlessly suffer from that self-belief. He suggests that caregiving fills a needfor the caregiver, as well as meeting a need forthe care receiver. He encourages the dependentperson to allow and accept their family andfriends to meet their need to provide care, mak-ing a reciprocal relationship\u2014not just a depen-dent, or one-way, relationship. you've got companionship\u2014other people . . .in your life. It doesn't have to be ahusband or a wife. It can be a friendor, like us, a sister. . . .\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, p. 83)28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 Page 334 Maintaining Independence 335 ommendations about an acceptablelevel of care at home. They did agreeand participated in a telephone emer-gency response system, with their twolocal daughters as responders. Bill and Marge each had regular med- ical appointments to monitor their med-ical needs. They usually agreed to havea daughter present to take notes, discussissues, help listen to the doctor, andrecord recommendations and follow-uprequired. Marge had progressive diffi-culty with Parkinson's symptoms, includ-ing restless leg syndrome, which oftenkept her awake at night and frequentlyrestless during the day. The complexityof her medical conditions\u2014now includ-ing Parkinson's, depression,arthritis macular degenera-tion, and dizziness\u2014 necessitated a vari- ety of medications. She was being seenby an internist, neurologist, audiologist,retinologist, and oncologist for periodicfollow-ups. Each was prescribing and/or treatments for their pri-mary diagnosis, sometimes changingeach other's medications or dosageswithout consultation with the other. Marge was hospitalized with an ex- acerbation of her restlessness, sleepless-ness, and depression. Her neurologistordered a medication evaluation anddiagnostic testing, and referred her to apsychologist from a sleep clinic forMarge had been cancer-free for 10 years after her breast cancer, mastec-tomy, and chemotherapy treatments.She continued to be treated for increas-ing Parkinson's symptoms, had beendiagnosed with adult onset diabetes,had fallen several times, and was hos-pitalized for agitation, restlessness, andinability to sleep. She was taking a vari-ety of medications for her various ail-ments, including an oral hypoglycemic,and a combination of Parkinson's meds,antidepressants, and sleep aids. During this time, family arranged for caregiving, per Bill and Marge's statedwish to remain at home and have careprovided there at whatever level wasrequired. These arrangements, over time,included a live-in caregiver, part-timepaid care, cleaning support, cook, andvariations of agency care. Inconsistent with their desire to stay at home and contrary to their agree-ment to accept help as needed, Bill andMarge found something wrong witheach aspect of care arranged by theirfamily. Bill especially declined the needfor care, denigrated Marge's depressionand physical needs, found fault witheach caregiver (e.g., body odor, weight,cooking ability, culture) and made lifeso miserable that Marge would agree tohis demands, fire the help, and join himin joint resistance to their family's rec- Case Study 9-5 (continues)28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 335 336 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life and laundry. Bill continued to deny theneed for the cooking assistance, andoften refused to eat the food preparedfor his diabetic wife. Instead, he wouldprepare and eat a pound of salad forbreakfast and lunch, and consequentlybecame anemic. Bill withdrew morefrom outside interactions\u2014includingchurch, which had always been impor-tant to him. He would often go for dayswithout much conversation with Marge,which then increased her sense of isola-tion. She was taking several medicationsfor depression, and tried another stint atcounseling, which was again short-livedbecause of Bill's negativity toward Marge,the psychologist, and the concept. Critical Thinking: What options existed for Bill and Marge? How muchshould their personal preference weighin the decisions made about their safetyand care? How do you know when it istime to step in and invoke the healthcare representative role that has beendesignated in advance directives?

Hemanaged coordination of care and med-ication balance. Bill was diagnosed with Alzheimer- type dementia during this period oftime, but continued to deny thinkingand memory problems. He again wasforced to give up driving, after severalepisodes of heading for the familiargrocery store in their town, but notreturning home for several hours. Thisre-created much of the unpleasant sce-nario of prior years when driving wasan issue for Bill and his family. Family often suggested assisted living or senior apartment living where therewould be help available as needed, plusmore socialization opportunities forMarge. Bill and Marge continued todeny the need for both, and Margewould often tearfully declare theirintention to remain at home throughthe remainder of their lifetimes. Bill andMarge continued to refuse full-timehelp in their home, but did agree to acleaning lady every other week, andeventually to 3-4 hours of caregiverhelp per day to include cooking, dishes, 28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 336 Maintaining Independence 337 \"By now, we've outlived just abouteveryone we used to know, so many ofour friends are much younger than weare.

They cankeep you up to date. So we'll take 'homefolks' wherever we find them!\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, p. 84) Relationships provide the structure for social support and connections. These social networksremain important for the elderly, even as physicalchanges may limit their participation in the net-work and the network itself may shrink due to theloss of some of its members. Primary relationshipsare usually with family. For the elderly, these rela-tionships usually provide cross-generational affec-tion and assistance\u2014highly valued evidence ofconcern and encouragement. As family becomesless available, relationships may be merged withfriends and cohabitants of residential facilities. Socialization is impacted by living arrange- ments. About 95% of the older adult populationlived independently in 2000, of whom about73% of men and 41% of women lived with theirspouse. Several hundred thousand also hadgrandchildren in their household (ADA, 2002). Socialization also impacts nutritional intake. Healthy individuals have better food intake\u2014up to 44% greater\u2014when eating with othersinstead of eating alone (ADA, 2002). \". . .

Marge soon decidedthat living alone in their townhome wasno longer feasible and consented to amove to senior apartment housing acrossthe parking lot from Bill's ECF. Critical Thinking: As a facility nurse, what accommodations in care planningshould be made to reflect Bill's desirefor independence, even as he mustaccept more and more levels of care?Bill had experienced several TIAs over time and had a larger stroke (CVA),which resulted in hospitalization. By thistime he was more frequently incontinent,forgetful, continued to lack in personalcare, and was emotionally very demand-ing on Marge, who was now physicallyunable to do the personal care that herequired. The decision was made to placeBill in a skilled nursing facility for reha-bilitation following the CVA hospitaliza-tion.

You do kindof wonder, when it's going to happen?That's why you learn to love each andevery day, child.\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1993, p. 205) Spirituality is more than the response to a religion or set of beliefs. It relates to the core ofthe person's being and his or her connection tothe universe. Ultimately, it has to do with one'smeaning and purpose in life. As seniors reviewtheir lives\u2014often in the presence of disease, dis-ability, and perhaps impending death\u2014theirquestions may reflect these issues: \"Who am I?Did, or do I make a difference? What is next?Can I handle getting old? What will become ofme?\" (Taylor, 2001, p. 1). These are spirit-oriented questions, which may indicate a spiritual search-ing. This searching should be taken into accountwhen helping the patient to identify and achievehis or her goals (Taylor, 2001). People who are facing potentially long-term or debilitating illnesses, confronting acutehealth crises, or suffering from loss and griefmay find themselves re-examining the founda-tional beliefs they have held since childhood.Usually, at no other time in a person's life is heor she so focused on evaluating the spiritual selfthan during such crises. . . .

They also tended to have less anxiety, lowerblood pressure, fewer strokes, fewer suicides, andless depression and substance abuse than less reg-ular attendees. And they tended to live longer,with a 28% lower chance of dying in the next 6years (Koenig, Hays, & Larson, 1999). Stress management may be an issue for the elderly, especially as their capacity for adaptationis taxed, at a time when uncontrollable changesmay be occurring in their care needs and livingcircumstances on a regular basis. Some stressmanagement strategies that are effective for otherage groups might also be appropriate for theelderly. Being in tune with one's feelings is astarting point from which expression of emotionsmight be appropriate. Others include exercise,prayer, deep breathing, daydreaming, progressiverelaxation, design of a quiet environment, medi-tation or guided imagery, and developing a clearunderstanding of the person's goals (vs. being thegoals of others in their environment). Goal Attainment \"You can't change the past, and toomany folks spend their whole livestrying to fix things that happenedbefore their time. You're better offusing your time to improve yourself.\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, p. 19)\"Pride in a job well done is the onekind of pride God allows you to have.I earned that pride. Nothing bringsmore satisfaction than doing qualitywork, than knowing that you've donethe very best you can. Reach high!\" \u2014Bessie Delany (1994, p. 39) Old age is often associated with problems involving health and loss of functional ability.Nurses and other health care providers who carefor the elderly in any capacity are frequentlychallenged to promote and maintain quality oflife for the persons they serve. However, a goal oftheir care can rarely be defined as freedom fromdisease. Rather, we can \"help patients to live asgood a life as possible, despite their illnesses anddecreasing capacities\" (Sarvimaki & Stenbock-Hult, 2000, p. 1026). Sarvimaki and Stenbock-Hult's Finnish study to evaluate quality of life inold age found that people who were studied\u2014those who lived in the community\u2014\"generallyviewed their life as meaningful, intelligible andmanageable . . . and seemed to have a strongsense of value or self-worth in terms of self-esteem\" (p. 1032). Patients of other cultures andresidential settings may have different responses;however, the patient of any culture or in any set-ting can provide strong clues as to what con-tributes to his or her own quality of life andgoals.

Aftermoving from the rehab unit to the gen-eral population, he responded well toone of the aides, and his humor and per-sonality began to show through hisdementia on occasion. Although his den-tures were lost, and he refused to coop-erate in obtaining and adjusting to newones, he ate well and gained 10 poundsin his first 3 months in the facility.

They canbe affected, however, by the person's nutritionalstatus, because nutrition is one of the majordeterminants of successful aging ( Figure 9-1 ). \"Elderly patients with unintentional weight lossare at higher risk for infection, depression anddeath.\" (Huffman, 2002, p. 640). Some causesof involuntary weight loss are depression, can-cer, cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders,medications, polypharmacy, and changes in psy-chotropic medication (Huffman, 2002). Weightloss can also be an indicator of malnutrition orother acute medical conditions. Diagnosis ofnutritional problems and appropriate interven-tion can prevent loss of function and independ-ence (Ennis, Saffel-Shrier, & Verson, 2001).Helpful tips are noted in Box 9-2 . SleepAlthough sleep patterns often change as one ages,waking up tired every day and disturbed sleeppatterns are not considered a part of normal aging.Adequate sleep is essential to good health and toquality of life for all persons, including the elderly.Poor sleep contributes to a variety of problemsincluding depression, attention and memory def-icits, increased falls at night, increased use of med-ication to enhance sleep, and daytime sleepiness\u2014all areas of increasing difficulty anyway for el-derly folks. Poor sleep can exacerbate these condi-tions and may be increasingly problematic as aperson ages (Dailey & Cravedi, 2005). Afternoon naps may help restore energy in the elderly (Gaspar, 1998). Other interventionsthat may help promote sleep include: Listening to classical or relaxing music at bedtime to promote relaxation Exposure to at least 2 hours of sunlight or bright light during the day Bedtime routine (per the patient, not a facility) Reduced noise levels at night Progressive whole-body relaxation tech- niques An individualized plan for each personfamily's decisions on his behalf, whenhe could no longer make them.and discuss quality-of-life issues thatmight have affected Bill's life 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 341 342 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life Medication used as a last resort (Gaspar, 1998) Exercise \"We get up with the sun, and the firstthing we do is exercise.

Basic guidelines for designing exercise pro- grams for the elderly focus more on health andfunctional capacity than on aerobic fitness. Bal-ance and gait are important aspects of assess-ments in older adults (see Chapter 7). Interactingelements of an exercise program include: W arm-up: Gentle stretching of muscles and light movement simulating theactual exercise activities. Low to moderate intensity levels: To avoid injury and to promote improvement incardiac risk factors (adapted to toleranceand preferences). Duration: A longer duration of lower intensity is recommended over thereverse for a minimum of 30 minutesper day; 10 minutes, three times per dayis also effective. Gradually increase theduration rather than the intensity. Frequency: Ideally low to moderate exercise every day (or most days) of theweek; for intense exercise, reduce thefrequency. Mode/type of exercise: Should be based on the participant's fitness level and reflecthis or her interests and availableresources; walking, cycling, or swim-ming may be appropriate. Exercisefacilities/fitness clubs offer a range ofactivities that can be combined into oneworkout (Mazzeo & Tanaka, 2001). Exercises in water (aquatic therapy) are ef- fective in improving balance and increasingstrength and range of motion, especially forthose persons with arthritis. The relative densityof the person and the water and resulting buoy-ancy make the flexibility and mobility exerciseseasier, more effective, and less painful. Thesebenefits then improve the person's balance andstability, which, in turn, helps in reducing falls(Suomi, 2001).Box 9-2 Nutritional Tips for Older Adults Eat breakfast every day. Select high-fiber food like whole grain breads and cereals, beans, vegetables,and fruits. Have three servings of low-fat milk, yogurt, or cheese a day. Dairy productsare high in calcium and vitamin D andhelp keep your bones strong as you age.Or take a calcium and vitamin Dsupplement. Drink plenty of water. You may notice that you feel less thirsty as you getolder, but your body still needs thesame amount of water. Ask your health care provider about ways you can safely increase the amountof physical activity you do now. Fit physical activity into your everyday life. For example, take short walksthroughout your day. You do not have tohave a formal physical activity programto improve your health and stay active. Get enough sleep. Stay connected with family, friends, and community.

The formalizedtraining reduced physical impairments andimproved functional limitations more than theunsupervised home exercise programs. Its ben-efit was suggested to be \"the prevention orpostponement of frailty that is severe enough tocause loss of independence\" (Binder et al., 2002,p. 1926). The additional socialization of a for-mal program, as well as the proximity of theuniversity medical center setting, were thoughtto be additional benefits in this study. Perhaps more practical, especially for resi- dents of facilities\u2014including assisted livingfacilities where a study was completed\u2014mightbe a resident-led walking club. The socializationinherent in such a program helps motivate theparticipants, which improves compliance.Participation was voluntary. Daily participationand the distance goals were established by eachresident depending on their physical status andendurance. A significant increase in each pretestmeasurement was noted. Residents found theexperience pleasurable, a means to manage cur-rent health problems (e.g., arthritic knees), andnoted positive physical and emotional benefitsfrom the walking activity (easier to get in andout of an automobile, improved feeling of sta-bility). The program produced benefits for theresidents, and required little from the facility inthe way of management and staff time (Tayloret al., 2003). Yoga for exercise or rehabilitation is also appropriate for the elderly. Rather than focusingon the stereotypes of bizarre body positions andEastern religious practices, the focus should beon the measurable physical and health benefitsthat result from prolonged practice of the tradi-tion. Over time the practice of yoga, throughemphasis on postures, breathing and medita-tion, and simple body movements done withmindfulness, can result in increased strength,balance, stamina, flexibility, and relaxation\u2014allareas needing attention by the elderly person(Taylor, 2001).Box 9-3 Additional Resources Delany, S., & Delany, A.

They say 'Don't dothis, don't do that.' It drives usplumb-jack crazy. Bessie always says,'If I break my fool neck falling downthe stairs while I'm feeding my littledog, well, so be it.' Folks think thatbecause you're old, you're unable todo for yourself. Well, look at us! . . .But you do have to be honest aboutyour limitations. If you don't do that,well, your clock's not ticking right!\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, pp. 119-120) Numerous studies have determined the importance of evaluation of risk factors for falls,and the impact of physical decline and per-formance changes. Prevention of falls must takeinto account the living situation of the elderlyperson. Those elderly with a more vigorousfunctional capacity usually fall due to hazards intheir home (e.g., storage problems, clutter, scat-ter rugs). Falls for the frail elderly are not nec-essarily related to home hazards, but rather tendto relate to functional changes (e.g., poor depthperception, arthritis). Home modifications shouldbe in place before the person becomes frail(Northridge & Levick, 2002). Home interventions, which use home visits and a standardized checklist by a team of nurses,therapists, and a social worker, can be helpful inevaluating the potential environmental hazardsthat might contribute to falls. Suggestions of pos-sible changes to the environment, facilitation ofmodifications, and training in the use of adaptiveequipment were helpful in reducing the numberof falls in a group of frail elderly with a historyof falls. However, modifications to the environ-ment alone were not sufficient to make the dif-ference. Compliance with the physical changes aswell as with the suggested behavioral changeswas also important (Nikolaus & Bach, 2003). Evaluation of physical performance measures may provide easily accessible screening for fu-ture risk of hospitalization and estimation ofdecline in health and function for older adults.Gait speed, chair rise, and balance evaluationsprovided information that led to prediction ofemerging difficulty in physical care and adecline in physical function. Performance mea-sures alone, or in combination with self-reportmeasures, were able to predict outcomes morethan self-report alone, suggesting the increaseduse of performance measures as an additional\"vital sign\" for health-related risk in olderadults (Studenski et al., 2003). Strength (defined as the ability to exert force) is less of a predictor of positive outcomes thanmuscle power (defined as the ability to exertforce quickly). Leg power has been correlatedwith gait speed, chair-rise time, and stair-climbtime. Leg power is a better predictor of physicalperformance than is leg strength, as studied incommunity-dwelling, mobility-limited people(Bean et al., 2002). Technological advances in the medical field have yielded the ability to assess patients for fallrisk. Screening and medical products for diag-nosing and treating dizziness and balance disor-ders, which identify those at greater risk for fallsdue to these causes, are becoming available tophysicians, clinics, and facilities for treating theelderly (Physician Compliance Wire, 2002). Value of Rehabilitation \"That's a big problem with someolder folks\u2014they have such low28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 346 Fall Prevention 347 expectations of themselves. Whenthey get to a certain age, they justgive up. That's a shame! If there's any-thing I've learned in all these years,it's that life is too good to waste a day.It's up to you to make it sweet.\" \u2014Sadie Delany (1994, p. 123 [after fracturing her left hip]) A decline in quality of life is not necessarily inherent as physical frailty increases with age.Therefore, rehabilitation goals and interventionsthat affect the outcomes patients may expect toachieve can be developed to optimize eachpatient's quest for holistic growth. Becausemedical personnel and family members oftenplace a higher regard on physical problems thanthe patients themselves do, and because aging isoften seen as the functional losses that occur nearthe end of one's life, rehabilitation goals are fre-quently established simply to minimize the pro-gressive losses of function. Rehabilitation goalsmay also affect one's spirituality and quality oflife, in that the elderly may wish to overcometheir limitations in search of a wholeness uniqueto the wisdom, meaning, and life satisfactionthey experience. A negotiation of goals to meetthe wishes of the elderly patient may providethe most meaningful rehabilitation program forthe individual (Johansson, 2003). Many factors influence the rehabilitation potential of the geriatric population. Copingstrategies such as the desire to be in control arehelpful, whereas feelings of stress, fear, and anxi-ety can lead to the helpless feeling of nothaving control. Returning control to the person inwhatever way possible\u2014whether in physicalcapacities or in a sense of control over one'sfuture\u2014is important in promoting the conceptof self-care. Spiritual well-being\u2014manifested,by some, through prayer and a voiced belief inGod\u2014is also a strong component in successfulcoping (Easton, 1999). Positive social support,providing a sense of stability, security, socialinteraction, and connectedness, is also importantand is associated with better physical outcomesof rehabilitation. Negative social support mayundermine the necessary emotional or physicalsupport for the rehab process, and may impair itby negative attitudes toward the person's goals.Family members may also be affected by agingand disability, so family dynamics, resources, andcoping strategies should also be considered whenevaluating the support systems of the person inrehab. Motivational factors, including goals,humor, caring, encouragement, and powerresulting from relationships, were found to bemuch more motivational than forced complianceor domination. Self-efficacy, or the degree of confidence pos- sessed by the person that he or she will be suc-cessful in performing certain acts, is alsoimportant to the success of a rehab program.Self-belief is a powerful predictor of ADL per-formance months after stroke rehab programcompletion, indicating the value of incorporat-ing self-efficacy into the assessment and treat-ment phases (Hellstrom, Lindmark, Wahlberg,& Fugl-Meyer, 2003). The need for preventive and rehabilitative interventions is particularly important for theoldest-old. Following hospitalization for med-ical illnesses, the older the patient, the morelikely he or she to lose ADL function during thecourse of hospitalization. More than half of thoseover 85 years had worse ADL function follow-ing a hospitalization. Discharge outcomes weremarkedly influenced by the functional changesafter the hospital admission. This outcome sug-gests that functional status of the elderly during28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 347 348 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life hospitalization needs to be monitored to pro-mote as much function as possible, in order tomaintain as much function as possible followingdischarge (Covinsky et al., 2003). Some studies also indicate that elderly stroke patients who have rehabilitation services at homeinstead of in the hospital have lower rates of cer-tain medical complications, achieve a better scorefor rating of depression, and experience lower ratesof admission to nursing homes (Bo et al., 2004). Use of and Alternatives toRestraints Restraint devices (belts, vests, pelvic ties, mitts, specialized chairs, bed side rails) are usually usedto promote the safety of the recipient\u2014especiallythose who are forgetful and unsteady. Defined as\"any manual method or physical or mechanicaldevice, material or equipment attached or adja-cent to [the resident's] body that the individualcannot remove easily which restricts freedom ofmovement or normal access to one's body.\"(Department of Health and Human Services,1999). Physical restraints are those applied to the body and a stationary object; chemical restraintsare those provided by a medication of some type.It is the restriction of freedom that makes therestraint what it is, whether physical or chemi-cal. Wandering, agitation, lashing out at others,unsteadiness and potential to fall, and pullingat tubing or needles have been common reasonsfor use of restraints. Because restraints also havethe potential for causing falls, injury, or evendeath and because quality-of-life issues may beaffected, there are protocols and stringent rulesgoverning their use. The Omnibus Reconcilia-tion Act (OBRA) mandates that restraints maybe used only to treat someone's medical condi-Box 9-4 Alternatives to Restraints Personal strengthening and rehabilita- tion program Use of personal assistance devices such as hearing aids, visual aids, and mobil-ity devices Use of positioning devices such as body and seat cushions or padded furniture Safer physical environment design, including removal of obstacles thatimpede movement, placement ofobjects and furniture in familiar places,lower beds, and adequate lighting Regular attention to physical and per- sonal needs, including toileting, thirst,hunger, socialization, and activitiesadapted to current ability and formerinterests Design of physical environment for close observation by staff Efforts to increase staff awareness of person's individual needs, includingassignment of staff particularly to theperson, in an effort to improve functionand decrease difficult behaviors Living environment designed to pro- mote relaxation and comfort, minimizenoise, provide soothing music, andmaintain appropriate lighting Provision of massage, art, movement activities and complementary therapies(e.g., Healing Touch, energy work) Use of bed, chair, and door alarms to alert to the need for assistance Source: Minnesota Department of Health.

Providing safe care for those with physical and mental limitations is an important concern.There is now convincing evidence that safe carecan be provided without unduly restricting free-dom and without creating other unnecessaryrisks ( Box 9-4 ). Alternative safety measures, tai- the individual's specific needs, can helpensure the patient's best possible quality of life(Minnesota Department of Health, 2001).Family members and caregivers may have spe-cific insights that are helpful in determining thepatient's habits, likes and dislikes, patterns ofbehavior, and overall condition. These insightscan be used to develop an individualized plan tominimize behaviors that lead to use of physicalrestraints (see Chapter 12 for further discussion).Restraint reduction should be done methodi-cally, including a planned substitution of alter-native, less restrictive measures to treat thespecific symptom with ongoing monitoring andrevision as the plan unfolds (Cooper, 2000). Financial Considerations Financial resources affect the options availableto meet the needs of the elderly. Those with ade-quate finances have a full range of possibilitiesopen to them for housing, location, and careresources. Others with modest but limited re-sources can take advantage of a variety of op-tions until their funds are depleted, and then (which she attributed to her inability toeat when she was short of breath afterher broken ribs) and seemed to have a bitmore energy than at previous visits. Critical Thinking: As the office nurse in whom Marge is confiding, what isyour reaction? How do you respond toMarge's verbalization of guilt? Howdoes her response correspond with yourunderstanding of the grieving process? IfMarge had died first, what do you thinkBill's grief reactions might have been? Personal Reflection: Do you think Marge's guilt is realistic? Howmight various aspects of their relation-ship affect Marge's grief?After Marge had been widowed for about 3 months, she visited her primaryphysician for a general checkup. Sheadmitted to feeling some guilt about hergrief, or apparent lack of it. She relatedher belief that her life has not changedmuch since Bill died, as she continued tohave her new friends and activities of thepast year in her senior apartment com-plex. She also said she didn't really missgoing to see him every day or two\u2014thatshe felt their \"relationship really endedwhen he got so mad and ugly after hecouldn't drive anymore.\" She was tear-ful in relating these feelings. Her appear-ance was good; she had lost some weight Case Study 9-928438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 349 350 Chapter 9: Changes That Affect Independence in Later Life must rely on family or government programs tomeet their care needs as they continue to age. For those with few resources, community and government programs are available to meet needs,and more are developing to meet the anticipatedneeds of the baby-boomer generation, which isnow maturing to older adulthood. Some programsto assist the elderly who have moderate/severefinancial limitations include Medicaid waiver,CHOICE, supplemental food banks, food stamps,and assisted living caregivers. Community Resources \"Don't be too proud to accept yourlimitations. The hardest thing is dis-covering that you can't do everythingthe way you used to. We're not happyhaving folks help us around thehouse, but we've come to accept it.But make sure you hire folks to dowhat you want. It's still your house,and you're still the boss!\" \u2014Sadie and Bessie Delany (1994, p. 126) There are many community resources of which nurses should be aware. The yellow pages andsome sections in the front of the telephone bookmay help. Many areas have resource guides pub-lished by the community United Way or otherorganization. Look for resources such as these: Geriatric case management: Provides coor- dination of care and communityresource referrals, either through a pub-lic agency such as a council on aging orthrough an entrepreneurial agency Senior transportation options: Must be available and senior friendly Meals on Wheels, food stamps, senior centermeals, etc.: Government or locally spon-sored programs; some have low-cost funding Caregiver associations and support groups:National via the Internet; local viasocial service agencies Respite care agencies Daycare services for seniors Hospice and palliative care programs:Through nursing agencies or hospitals Disease-specific support groups and associa-tions: National or local chapters Eldercare agencies Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA):Medicare, Medicaid Medicaid waiver programs: Subsidized home care support; financial criteria foreligibility Local/community health clinics Medication assistance programs: Through the medication manufacturer, with thecooperation of the physician or medicalcare provider Implications for Nursing Care Nurses in a variety of practice settings have a great opportunity to impact the lives ofcommunity-based elderly patients. In the doc-tor's office, the nurse is usually the first to talkwith the patient on a visit. While taking vitalsigns, the nurse can begin to evaluate eating,sleeping, and socialization factors that might beinfluencing the patient's condition and abilityto remain independent. The nurse can ask abouttelephone use, social supports, activities, andinvolvement in the community. If caregivers arepresent at the appointment, the nurse can askabout patient management, coping mecha-nisms, and need for respite or relief. 28438_CH09_321_354.qxd 6/6/06 5:13 PM Page 350 Glossary 351 The hospital nurse can also look for and dis- cuss with families/caregivers the safety issuesand functional needs and abilities to be consid-ered before a patient is released home (Rose,Bowman, & Kresevic, 2000). Referral to thesocial services department can provide educa-tion, counseling, and links to community re-sources for the patient/caregiver. Specialty nurses in the clinic, office, or hos- pital can be on the lookout for those patients/families who might benefit from support groupsor other referrals particular to their diagnoses orconditions. Visiting nurse services offer in-home care and support, therapies, and social services thatare designed to keep patients functional andcommunity-based for as long as possible. What-ever the setting, nurses may act as resources forolder persons to promote continued indepen-dence into later life. Personal Reflections 1. In what practice setting do you, as an individual, think you can most positively impact the elderly patients you encounter? Why? 2. Do you have experiences with elderly family members who have influenced your deci- sion to become a nurse? Elaborate on the personal lessons you have learned from yourelderly family members in making your career choice. \"But however you do it, you've just got to fight in this life. When you'reyoung, you're busy trying to fight against all the big problems of theworld. When you're older, you have to fight to hold on to things likeyour property and your dignity and your independence. If there's onething you've got to hold on to, it's the courage to fight!\"\u2014Bessie Delany (1994, p. 125) 3. Read the quote above. Do you agree with the Delany sisters' outlook about fighting throughout life? Why or why not?

Scientific evi- dence supports the fact that functional disabilityis not caused by aging, per se, but results from ill-nesses and diseases that are related to unhealthylifestyle decisions. Up to 70% of the physical dis-abilities associated with the aging process resultfrom unhealthy behaviors or lifestyles (NationalCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention andHealth Promotion, 1999). This creates an excit-ing opportunity for nurses to improve the qualityof life for the elderly client through evidence-based health promotion activities. In this chapter, we will review the health pro- motion and disease prevention guidelines rec-ommended by the following groups: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force(USPSTF): USPSTF was convened by the U.S. Public Health Service to sys-tematically review the evidence of effec-tiveness of clinical preventive services.The task force is an independent panelof private-sector experts in primary careand prevention whose mission is to eval-uate the benefits of individual servicesand to create age-, gender-, and risk-based recommendations about servicesthat should routinely be incorporatedinto primary medical care (http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm). Healthy People 2010: Healthy People 2010 is an initiative of the U.S.Department of Health and HumanServices that utilized the skills andknowledge of an alliance of more than350 national organizations and 250state public health, mental health, sub-stance abuse, and environmental agen-cies to develop a set of health careobjectives designed to increase the qual-ity and quantity of years of healthy lifeof Americans and to eliminate healthdisparities (http://www.healthypeople.gov/). The recommendations presented in this chap- ter are guidelines for most patients, most of thetime. Clinical judgment is used in applying theseguidelines to individual clients (e.g. the risk andbenefits of colonoscopy will be quite different fora healthy 75 year old versus a frail 75 year old withmetastatic cancer). Individual variations in healthstatus increase markedly with age, necessitatingan individualized approach to health care. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Definitions Health promotion activities are those activities in which an individual is able to proactivelyengage, in order to advance or improve his orher health. Primary prevention activities are those designed to completely prevent a diseasefrom occurring, such as immunization againstpneumonia or influenza. Secondary preven- tion efforts are directed toward early detection and management of disease, such as the use ofcolonoscopy to detect small cancerous polyps.Tertiary prevention efforts are used to manage clinical diseases in order to prevent them fromprogressing or to avoid complications of the dis-ease, as when beta blockers are used to helpremodel the heart in congestive heart failure. Screening Health screening is a form of secondary pre- vention and will be a focus of this chapter. In28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 358 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 359 order to endorse screening for a specific disease,the USPSTF considers whether the disease occurswith enough frequency in a population to justifymass screening. The population is more likely tobenefit from screening tests for a disease likediabetes, which occurs frequently, than it is tobenefit from screening for Addison's disease,which is uncommon. In order to justify the costsand inconvenience of screening we must be ableto detect the condition being screened at a rela-tively early stage and have effective treatmentsfor the condition. Early detection of the diseasehas to result in improved clinical outcomes. Thescreening tests should be relatively noninvasiveand acceptable to patients, cost-effective andavailable, and highly sensitive and specific. Screening recommendations are graded by expert panels according to the strength of thesupporting evidence and the net benefit. TheUSPSTF uses the following rating scale: Level A: USPSTF strongly recommends screening based on good evidence thatscreening improves health outcomes andbenefits outweigh screening risks.Level B: USPSTF recommends screening based on fair evidence that health out-comes and benefits outweigh screeningrisks.Level C: USPSTF makes no recommenda- tion for or against screening because thebalance of benefit and risk is too close tojustify a general recommendation.Level D: USPSTF recommends against screening because there is at least fair evi-dence that screening is either ineffectiveor harmful.Level I: USPSTF makes no recommenda- tion based on insufficient evidence orresearch.Focus of Health PromotionEfforts A major focus of health promotion efforts for theelderly is to minimize the loss of independenceassociated with illness and functional decline.Healthy People 2010 and the USPSTF suggestthat nurses need to focus on the following areas Box 10-1 Research Highlight Aim: This longitudinal study examined the health benefits derived from partici-pation in proactive health-promotingbehaviors for independent-living elders,ages 72 and older. Methods: Annual, in-home interviews were conducted over a 9-year periodwith 1,000 subjects in order to deter-mine if health-promoting behaviors,reported at baseline, were positivelycorrelated with quality of life 8 yearslater, at the termination of the study. Findings: Exercise was found to improve performance on IADLs and increaselifespan and quality of life. Tobaccoavoidance was correlated with improve-ment in longevity. Conclusion: There is unlikely to be an upper age limit beyond which healthpromotion efforts are not helpful inimproving quality and quantity of life.

Long-term impact ofpreventive proactivity lifeof the 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 359 360 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly in order to promote health and prevent disabil-ity in the elderly client. Physical activity Nutrition Tobacco use Safety Immunization Many of these foci show considerable overlap with recommendations for younger adults, butsome, like injury prevention safety and hearingand vision screening ( Table 10-1 ), are unique to older adults. It is important to consider theimpact of health conditions on physical func-tioning and on quality of life in the older client.This is different from the younger adult's focuson treatment and cure of a single, acute condi-tion. Multiple chronic illnesses are common inthe elderly, and cure is often an unrealistic andinappropriate goal. These chronic illnesses canlead to disability and dependency. In fact,almost 15% of Americans over 65 years of agerequire help with bathing, dressing, meal prepa-ration, or shopping. Symptoms that impactfunctional status should be the focus of inter-ventions with this population. Maintaining Table 10-1 Summary of USPSTF Screening Recommendations for Older Adults Screening Test Recommendation Level of EvidencePhysical activity Physical activity has a positive impact on health counseling but we don't know if counseling about exercise is effective in helping people to begin exercising. Nutrition Counseling clients with chronic illnesses about nutrition is beneficial. Information should begeared to the chronic illness. Tobacco use Screening is helpful in identifying tobacco use and counseling is effective in helping people quitsmoking. Safety Falls can be prevented by medication monitoring, balance and strength exercises, and home safetyevaluation. Immunizations Annual flu vaccine Pneumococcal vaccine once after age 65 and one-time revaccination for clients over age 75 who'venot been vaccinated in 5 years Td vaccine every 10 years Depression Screening is effective in identifying depression and treatments are effective. Dementia Insufficient evidence to support mass screening of elders for dementia, but good evidence to suggestscreening to follow up on family or 360 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 361 independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) is an important goal for health pro- moting activities. By the time we are 85 years old, one half of our remaining years of life are expected to belived dependently, often in a nursing home.About 2.3 million elderly Americans have somefunctional limitation, and half of elderly clientshospitalized for medical illness were found tohave some deficiency in ADLs (AmericanAcademy of Family Physicians [AAFP], 2004).Some of the preventive strategies that will bediscussed in this chapter, like smoking cessa-tion, immunization, physical activity, weightcontrol, blood pressure control, and arthritis anddiabetes self-management programs, are knownto be effective in lessening disability. Assessment of functional status requires a multipronged approach. The ADL scale and theinstrumental activities of daily living (IADL)Table 10-1 Summary of USPSTF Screening Recommendations for Older Adults (continued) Screening Test Recommendation Level of EvidenceAlcohol abuse Screening is beneficial and treatment is effective.Elder abuse and neglect No evidence that either screening or interventions are effective. Lipids Good evidence to support that treatment and screening are effective. Hypertension Good evidence to support that treatment and screening are effective.

Thyroid disease Insufficient evidence to support screening for thyroid disease. Osteoporosis Screening is recommended for all women over 65 years of age. Vision and hearing Hearing screening is recommended for older adults.Glaucoma testing by an ophthalmologist isrecommended for adults at risk of developingglaucoma. Prostate cancer Insufficient evidence to recommend screening.Breast cancer Mammography is recommended every 1 to 2 years as a screening for breast cancer for older women. Colorectal cancer Screening for colorectal cancer 362 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly scale are valid and reliable self-report tools toassess functional status (Lawton & Brody, 1969).Nurses can use these instruments to identifyelderly individuals who are frail and may bene-fit from an increased level of care or additionalin-home support. Fear of being advised to leave their home can cause elderly individuals to deny difficulties.The ADL and IADL scales rely on self-reportingand can fail to detect difficulties when clientsare not forthcoming about their limitations. Performance-based tools, like the Get Up and Go test (Duxbury, 1997), can provide amore objective measurement of functional sta-tus and fall risk. This assessment requires clientsto rise from a chair, walk 10 feet, turn around,return to the chair, and sit down. These actionsare timed and compared with a historic sampleof adults without balance problems who wereable to complete this test in under 10 seconds.Older adults who are dependent in most activi-ties of daily living and have poor balance andgait may take more than 30 seconds to completethe task. Clients are observed for sitting balance,transfers, gait, and ability to maintain balancewhile turning. If a gait abnormality is detected,weight-bearing exercise and physical rehabilita-tion may prevent further decline and lessen therisk of falls. Self-ManagementWhat can nurses do to encourage clients toadopt health-promoting behaviors and managetheir chronic illnesses? Kate Lorig, MD, hasbeen instrumental in developing the concept ofself-management and outlining the role of thehealth care provider in fostering the client's self-management of his or her chronic condition(Lorig, Holman, 2000). Her research, which wassponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Re-search and Quality (AHRQ), has supported theeffectiveness of chronic disease self-managementin preventing or delaying disability fromchronic diseases. She has described how the self-management concept may be applied to healthpromotion activities, as well. The Chronic Disease Self Management Program (CDSMP) is a 17-hour course for patients with chronic diseases that is taught bytrained laypeople. The course goal is to teachpatients to improve symptom management,maintain functional ability, and adhere to theirmedication regimens. The proven effectivenessof the intervention is, at least in part, attribut-able to the improved self-efficacy of clients whoparticipate in the program. Clients come tobelieve that they can succeed in managing theirillness and preventing disability. Critical to the concept of self-management is an assessment of the client's goals and concerns,which may be different from the health care pro-fessional's goals and concerns. The nurse mayfeel that exercise will help lower her client'sblood pressure, which may decrease stroke risk,certainly an important goal. The client's focus,however, may be that he does not want to goshopping for new clothes as a result of his recentweight gain, and his goal is to be able to con-tinue to use his current wardrobe. He will assessthe value of his new exercise program in termsof his clothing budget, not in relation to hisblood pressure readings. Lorig has identified five key elements of self- management programs: problem solving, deci-sion making, resource utilization, forming ahealth care professional/client partnership, andtaking action. In the problem-solving phase, aclient may identify several barriers to initiatingan exercise program and then list strategies forovercoming each barrier, to arrive at a workable28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 362 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 363 strategy. Decision making helps arm clientswith the information needed to make the deci-sions they need to make on a daily basis: \"Howdo I know when I am exercising too hard?\"\"Should I exercise when I don't feel well?\" Theprovider plays an important role in providingaccurate and sufficient information for clients tomake informed decisions. Providers also teachclients to access and evaluate appropriateresources and to create plans that are easilyaccomplished, limited in scope, and easily eval-uated for success. A technique that has provensuccessful is to ask clients how confident theyare, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being maximally con-fident), that they will accomplish their objec-tive. If the score is less than 7, encourage themto set a more realistic goal. Contracting for health promoting behaviors is another useful strategy. A successful contractfor behavior change is very specific. The contractmay begin with the overall behavioral goal (\"Iwish to lose 20 pounds over the next year in orderto improve my overall health, strength, and stam-ina.\"). The client determines his own short-termgoal and means of achieving that goal for the nextweek (\"I will exercise for 20 minutes, three timesthis week.\"). The nurse helps the client to pin-point exactly how and when that will occur. Theclient is encouraged to write the exact time thatthe exercise will occur on his daytimer, and theexact form the exercise will take (\"I will walkaround my subdivision, which is 1 1/4miles in length, at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Thursday, andSaturday.\"). Ideally, the client and nurse will meetat the end of that time period to evaluate andmodify the plan for the next week or so. Barriersto implementing the plan are reviewed and takeninto consideration in order to rewrite the follow-ing week's contract. Self-management classes andcontracting are strategies that can be incorpo-rated, through individual sessions or in groupmeetings, to help implement the health promo-tion and disease prevention ideas discussed in thischapter.Physical ActivityFunctional decline in the elderly is attributable,at least in part, to physical inactivity. A signif-icant number of deaths in the United Stateshave been traced to insufficient activity andinadequate nutrition (McGinnis & Foege, 1993).Despite the well-documented benefits of exer-cise in reducing blood pressure and cholesterol,improving insulin resistance, reducing weight,strengthening bones, and reducing falls, twothirds of adults between 65 and 75 years of ageare inactive. Thirty minutes of moderate activ-ity, like brisk walking, can have dramatic, pos-itive effects on health and well-being, but only12% of Americans 75 years of age and older per-form this level of activity. Physical inactivity causes increased health care costs to our nation. In fact, a CDC study hasshown that the direct medical costs of inactiveAmericans are markedly higher than costs foractive Americans. The direct medical costs asso-ciated with physical inactivity were nearly $76.6billion in 2000 (National Center for ChronicDisease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2004). Scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of moderate physical activity in: Decreasing overall mortality Decreasing coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in the UnitedStates Decreasing colon cancer Decreasing incidence and improving management of diabetes mellitus Decreasing incidence and improving management of hypertension28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 363 364 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly Decreasing obesity Improving depression Improving quality of life Improving functional status Decreasing falls and injury Moderate exercise is defined as 30 or more min-utes of brisk walking on 5 or more days per week.Tai chi and yoga are helpful for improving balanceand flexibility. Modified exercises, such as arm-chair exercises, can be helpful for the frail elderlyor those with mobility restrictions. Sporadic, vig-orous exercise should be discouraged. Barriers to physical exercise that have been identified by the elderly include lack of accessto safe areas to exercise, pain, fatigue, impair-ment in sensory function, and mobility. Thesebarriers underscore the need to individualizeyour approach to helping clients develop anexercise regimen tailored to their unique needsand to participate in community efforts to cre-ate environments that foster healthy lifestyles.The Partnership for Prevention (2002) devel-oped an excellent community assessment guidewith a list of strategies for communities to over-come barriers to physical activities encounteredby older adults. This guide, called \"CreatingCommunities for Active Aging,\" is accessible onthe Web at http://www.prevent.org/publications/Active_Aging.pdf. What can be done to foster participation in physical exercise? Individuals can increase theirchances of beginning, and sticking with, anexercise program if they identify activities thatcan be a regular part of their daily routine andidentify individuals who can participate in theexercise with them. Nurses can help clients toassess their current level of activity and barriersthat prevent them from exercising. The nursecan then help the client with goal setting, write a prescription for exercise, work with the clientto develop an exercise program individually tai-lored to the client's unique needs, and follow upby telephone at regular intervals to assessprogress and barriers. Follow-up phone calls canalso be used to assess how well the client hasdone with accessing community resources.NutritionFour of the 10 leading causes of death in theUnited States (cancer, diabetes, coronary heartdisease, and cerebral vascular accidents) are asso-ciated with unhealthy dietary patterns. Morethan 80% of Americans do not eat enough fruitsor vegetables and eat too much fat. Elderlyclients may be at increased risk for poor nutri-tion due to the fact that they have multiplechronic illnesses, may have tooth or mouthproblems that may interfere with their ability toeat, may be socially isolated, may have economichardship, may be taking multiple medicationsthat can cause changes in appetite or gastroin-testinal symptoms, and may need assistanceBox 10-2 Physical Activity Counseling Level I recommendation. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to deter-mine whether encouraging or counsel-ing patients to begin an exerciseprogram actually led to improvementsin their level of physical activity. Thereis strong evidence to support the effec-tiveness of physical activity in reducingmorbidity and mortality from chronicillness.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 364 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 365 with self-care. Weight gain or loss may signalnutritional problems. The USPSTF found good evidence that focused counseling interventions can produce significantchanges among elderly clients who are atincreased risk for diet-related chronic illness.This risk can be assessed with the followingassessment tests: DETERMINE Your Nutritional HealthChecklist: This tool was created by the Nutrition Screening Initiative, a collab-orative project of health, medical, andaging organizations. The NutritionChecklist can be ordered from theirWeb site for a nominal fee(http://www.aafp.org/x16087.xml). Serum albumin: /H110213.5 g/dl is associated with malnutrition and increased mor-bidity and mortality. Body mass index (BMI): The Nutrition Screening Initiative suggests that a BMIof 22-27 is to be considered normal.Values above or below this range sug-gest over- and underweight, respec-tively. Unintended weight loss is anutritional risk that requires additionalassessment. Obesity is a problem formany older Americans, just as it is foryounger adults. The Obesity EducationInitiative of the National Heart, Lung,and Blood Institute has provider guide-lines and patient education materials(http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/oei/index.htm). Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) Choles-terol Guidelines: An unintended decrease in cholesterol to less than 150 mg/dl isa nutritional risk (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/index.htm).ADL and IADL measures: These can assess a client's ability to eat and preparefood and to do the shopping and trans-portation necessary for good nutrition. Dietary Reference Intakes and RecommendedDaily Allowances: These may be com- pared with food diaries from a 24- to48-hour period to assess marked devia-tion from these guidelines. Clients whouse many vitamin and nutritional sup-plements may be at risk for toxicities. Depression and dementia: These are risk factors for nutritional compromise. The Nutrition Screening Initiative has booklets for clients and providers that are helpfulin teaching about screening and treating nutri-tional problems related to chronic illnesses. Thebooklets may be accessed at http://www.aafp.org/PreBuilt/NSI_newbookletSMALLER.pdf. General guidelines for dietary counseling include: Limit alcohol to one drink a day for women, two daily for men. Limit fat and cholesterol. Maintain balanced caloric intake. Ensure adequate daily calcium, especially for women. Older adults should consume vitamin B 12 in crystalline form, which can be derivedfrom fortified cereals and supplements Older adults who have minimal expo- sure to sunlight or who have dark skinneed supplemental vitamin D. Dailyvitamin D intake should be 400-600IU and can be derived from fortifiedfoods or supplements. Include adequate whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Drink adequate water28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 365 366 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly Tobacco UseIt is estimated that 4.5 million Americans aged65 and older smoke cigarettes and that smokingaccounts for one out of every five U.S. deaths.Elderly Americans are just as likely to benefitfrom quitting smoking as are younger adults.Quitting smoking can decrease the chance ofhaving a myocardial infarction or dying fromlung cancer or heart disease. Nonsmokers haveimproved wound healing, recovery from illness,and cerebral circulation. A practice guideline to guide clinicians to help their patients quit smoking has been devel-oped through the Public Health Service and isavailable online at http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tobacco/whatisphs.htm. The task force stressesthat the most important step in helping a clientto quit smoking is to screen for tobacco use andassess the client's willingness to quit. They out-line two different interventions, the 5 As, forclients who are ready to quit smoking, and the5 Rs, for those who need additional motivationbefore they are ready to quit. The 5 As Ask about smoking status at each health care visit.Advise client to quit smoking.Assess client's willingness to quit smok- ing at this time.Assist client to quit using counseling and pharmacotherapy.Arrange for follow-up within one week of scheduled quit date. The 5 Rs Relevance means asking the client to think about why quitting may be person-ally relevant for him.Risks of smoking are identified by the client. Rewards of quitting are identified by the client.Roadblocks or barriers to quitting are identified by the client.Repetition of this process at every clinic visit. Most people who successfully quitsmoking require multiple attempts. SafetyMany of the safety recommendations for olderadults are similar to those for younger people:Box 10-3 Nutrition Counseling Level B recommendation. The USPSTF found good evidence to support coun-seling interventions among adults atrisk for diet-related chronic disease.Interventions that have proven to stim-ulate healthy dietary changes combinenutrition education with behavioralcounseling. Box 10-4 Tobacco Cessation Counseling Level A recommendation. The USPSTF found good evidence that screening,brief behavioral counseling, and phar-macotherapy are effective in helpingclients to quit smoking and remainsmoke-free after one year. There is gooddata to support that smoking cessationlowers the risk for heart disease, stroke,and lung disease.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 366 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention 367 using lap and shoulder belts in motor vehicles,avoiding driving while intoxicated, using smokedetectors in the home, and maintaining hotwater heaters at or below 120 /H11034F. Falls, however, are a safety risk that is relatively unique to theelderly. Falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury death in older adults in this country.Approximately one half of elderly adults livingin institutions and one third of community-dwelling elders fall every year (Roman, 2004).Between 5% and 11% of these falls result in ser-ious injuries, including fractures. Twelve thou-sand Americans die as a result of a fall each year.Elderly adults are susceptible to falls as a resultof postural instability, decreased muscle strength,gait disturbances and decreased proprioception,visual and/or cognitive impairment, and poly-pharmacy. Environmental conditions that con-tribute to falls are slippery surfaces, stairs,irregular surfaces, poor lighting, incorrect foot-wear, and obstacles in the pathway. Patients who fall more than twice in a 6- month period require fall risk assessment andintervention. An easy-to-administer fall riskassessment tool is one that uses the mnemonic \"IHATE FALLING.\" It is described in Box 10-5 . Balance and strengthening exercises, home safety modifications, and elimination of high-risk medications have been the focus of fall-riskprevention strategies. There are strong data tosupport the effectiveness of balance andstrengthening exercises on fall reduction andresearch to support physiologic and environ-mental risk factor reduction, as well. The inten-sity of intervention required to make adifference, however, is not clear at this point.We do not know whether discussing the need toexercise and some home safety and medicationrecommendations in a brief office visit will be effective in reducing falls, or if a more intensiveintervention is necessary. There is evidence tosupport the latter, intensive approach in com-munity-dwelling elders aged 75 or older or inclients 70-74 years of age who use antihyper-tensive or psychoactive medications, who usefour or more prescription medications, or whohave cognitive impairment or impairment ofgait, strength, or balance (USPSTF, 2004).Polypharmacy and Medication ErrorsElderly adults are at increased risk of adversedrug effects compared to younger adults,because they take more medications, as well asdue to the biologic effects of aging and chronicdiseases. Medication under- and overutilizationby this population has been shown to increaseBox 10-5 I Hate Falling Inflammation of joints or joint deformity Hypotension (orthostatic blood pressure change) Auditory and visual abnormalities Tremor Equilibrium problems Foot problems Arrythmias, heart block, valvular disease Leg-length discrepancy Lack of conditioning (generalized weakness) Illness Nutrition (poor, weight loss) Gait disturbance Source: Adapted with permission from Sloan, J.

AHRQ has appointed a Task Force on Aging to investigate important health issues related tothe elderly population. This task force has setenhanced patient safety through reduction ofmedication errors in the elderly population as oneof its priorities for clinical practice improvement.The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has cre-ated a Personal Medication Organizer to help se-niors play an active role in keeping track of theirown medications. The organizer is available atwww.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/personalMedOrg.pdf. Adults over 65 years of age take an average of 4.5 prescription and 2 over-the-counter med-ications at any one time. This number is mark-edly higher for hospitalized patients or thoseliving in nursing homes or assisted living facil-ities. Polypharmacy is not always inappropriatein this population of clients who have multiplechronic illnesses, but increased numbers of med-ications carry increased risks. Frail elderly adultsare more likely than healthier age-mates to suf-fer adverse drug reactions. It is estimated that one fifth of community- dwelling elderly clients are prescribed medicationsthat are not recommended for use in this popu-lation. These medications include long-actingbenzodiazepines, sedative analgesics, anti-emetics, antispasmodics.Elderly clients who require home care services andare, therefore, among the more disabled, are pre-scribed these medications even more often thanthe healthier members of their cohort. The Beer'sList of medications to be avoided in the elderly hasbecome a national guideline for prescribers andpharmacists in the United States (Fick, Cooper,Wade, Waller, Maclean, & Beers, 2003). ImmunizationsAnnual vaccination against influenza is recom-mended for all adults 65 years of age and olderbecause more than 90% of the deaths frominfluenza occur in this population. Several stud-ies suggest that flu vaccination is beneficial inpreventing illness, hospitalization, and mortal-ity in both community-dwelling and institu-tionalized elderly individuals. For elderly clientsresiding in assisted living facilities or in nursinghomes, during institutional outbreaks, amanta-dine or rimantadine should be given at the sametime as the vaccination and continued for 2weeks in order to provide protection until im-munity from vaccination develops. Older adults, especially those with chronic illnesses or who live in nursing homes, are sus-ceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia, whichresults in death in over one third of clients over65 years of age who acquire the disease. Theemergence of drug-resistant strains of pneumo-coccal disease underscores the importance ofBox 10-6 Fall Prevention Counseling Level B recommendation. Balance and strengthening exercise programs, homesafety assessment and training, and med-ication monitoring and adjustment arerecommended in order to reduce fall risk.

There is evi-dence to support one-time-only revaccinationfor clients 75 years and older who have not beenvaccinated in 5 or more years. Tetanus and diphtheria are uncommon dis- eases in the United States, but only 28% ofadults age 70 and older are immune to tetanus.It is these adults who account for the majority oftetanus, a disease that results in death in morethan one quarter of cases. The tetanus and diph-theria (Td) vaccine is highly efficacious againsttetanus, but immunity may wane after 10 years.Periodic boosters of tetanus vaccine, tradition-ally given every 10 years in the United States, arerecommended for older adults by the USPSTF. Mental Health Screening Mental health enables individuals to participatein productive activities and relationships and toadjust to change and loss. Mental disorders arecharacterized by alterations in mood, behaviors,or cognition and are associated with impairedfunctioning and/or distress. Mental disordershave been associated with complications result-ing in disability or death and profoundly affectfamily members as well as patients. Mental dis-orders are as common in late life as they are dur-ing other stages of the lifespan, but some disor-ders are relatively unique to elderly clients. Depression Although estimates of depression vary widely,up to 37% of community-dwelling older adultsare depressed. Depression rates increase markedlyamong clients who have chronic illness or dis-ability and have been found to be 12% for hos-pitalized geriatric clients and up to 25% fornursing home residents. Elderly men have thehighest rates of suicide in the nation. There is good evidence to support screening for depression in adults, including older adults.Screening can improve identification of depressedelders and improve outcomes. Screening effortsmust be coordinated with effective treatment andfollow-up in order to have maximal benefit.Initial screening may be accomplished by askingtwo questions about mood and anhedonia: \"Overthe past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed,or hopeless?\" and \"Over the past 2 weeks, haveyou felt little interest or pleasure in doingthings?\" A positive response to this initial screenmay be followed with the Geriatric DepressionScale (see Figure 10-1 ), which has been found to have a 89%-92% sensitivity for detecting depres-sion in elderly adults (Kurlowicz, 1999). A posi-tive depression screen should be followed with anassessment of suicide risk and substance abuse.

Dementia is a chronic andprogressive illness characterized by behavioraland cognitive changes that affect memory, prob-lem solving, judgment, and speech, and thatcause deficits in functional abilities. Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence at this time to suggest that population-widescreening of Americans 65 years and older fordementia is beneficial. We do know that it isdifficult to recognize early AD and, in fact, onestudy demonstrated that primary care physi-cians failed to detect AD 24% to 72% of thetime. Failure to diagnose early AD may severelycompromise client safety as a result of householdaccidents and motor vehicle accidents. Theseclients are susceptible to financial losses througherrors and scams that prey on the elderly. Thereis sufficient evidence to support the fact thatmedication delays the rate of cognitive impair-ment associated with AD, which can lead toimproved quality of life for individuals and fam-ilies, and decreased costs of care for our nation.Experts do recommend thorough screening forclients in whom cognitive impairment is sus-pected or when concerns are expressed by fam-ily members or friends. Three screening tests are commonly used for all forms of dementia. The Mini Mental StateExamination (MMSE) is considered the \"goldstandard\" diagnostic test to detect dementia. Ithas reasonable sensitivity and specificity, and canbe made more sensitive or specific depending onthe cutpoint used to diagnose dementia (Folstein,Folstein, McHugh, 1975). The clock-drawingtest, in which a client is asked to draw a clock faceand indicate a particular time, is a sensitive butnonspecific screening test (Sunderland et al.,1989). The use of informant reporting of an indi-vidual's cognitive status has been found to be auseful screening tool as well. It is important to distinguish between screen- ing tools and tests used for the differential di-agnosis of dementia. A thorough dementiaevaluation involves a complete history and exam-ination, laboratory testing, and brain imaging. Alcohol Abuse The prevalence of alcohol abuse by community-dwelling elderly in the United States is largelyunknown, but 6% to 11% of elderly adultsadmitted to hospitals are found to have problemswith alcohol (National Institute of Alcohol Abuseand Alcoholism, 1998). It is very difficult todiagnose alcohol problems in the elderly for sev-eral reasons. Retired people do not have thelifestyle disruptions caused by heavy alcohol usethat are commonly encountered in youngeradults. They are less likely to be arrested due todisorderly conduct or aggression related to theirdrinking. Alcoholics over the age of 65 are morelikely to be living alone and drinking alone thanyounger adults. On the other hand, the olderdrinker is more likely to honestly report his or herdrinking to the health care provider and morelikely to comply with treatment strategies.Elderly clients have alcohol-related complicationsBox 10-11 Dementia Screening Level I recommendation. The USPSTF found the clinical evidence to be insuf-ficient to recommend screening for allelderly clients in a primary care setting.Most expert panels agree that clientswho are suspected of having cognitiveimpairment or whose families expressconcern about their cognitive function-ing should be screened.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 371 372 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly that are not generally seen in younger adults,such as increased rates of hip fractures due tofalls and medication reactions due to alcohol'seffects on liver enzyme systems. There is some evidence to suggest that light to moderate alcohol consumption in older adultsmay reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism (NIAAA) recommends no morethan one drink per day for this purpose. More than 7 drinks per week for women, or 14 drinks per week for men, is the quantity of alco-hol that has been defined as \"risky\" or \"hazardous.\" Several screening tools are commonly used to screen for alcohol abuse. The CAGE questionnaireis a self-report screening instrument that is easyand quick to administer (Ewing, 1984). It asksfour yes/no questions and requires approximately1 minute to complete. CAGE is a mnemonic forthe four key screening questions: Cut Down question relates to attempts by the client to cut down on drinking. Annoyance is related to suggestions by friends or family to cut down on drinking. Guilt about drinking. Eye opener relates to a question about the need for a drink in the morning toget going. The CAGE questionnaire has been found to have a 75% sensitivity and a 96% specificity. The5 As and 5 Rs strategies defined under the sectionon tobacco abuse in this chapter are also suggestedstrategies for reducing alcohol consumption. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item screening test developed bythe World Health Organization and is sensitivefor detecting alcohol dependence and abuse. Youcan learn more about this screening tool at http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf.Elder Abuse and Neglect Unfortunately, it is difficult to estimate theprevalence of elder abuse and neglect in thiscountry due, at least in part, to the lack ofappropriate screening instruments and conse-quent underreporting of abuse and neglect byhealth care professionals. Reporting of elderabuse to the adult protective service agency is mandatory in almost all states, but it is esti-mated that only 1 in 10 cases of elder abuse andneglect is actually reported. There is a paucityof studies to determine the effectiveness of inter-ventions in decreasing abuse. Studies directedtoward identification of both abuse victims andperpetrators are needed. Elder abuse may include physical, sexual, psychological, and financial exploitation; neg-lect; and violation of rights. Physical abuseincludes shaking, restraining, hitting, or threat-ening with objects. Sexual abuse includesunwanted contact with the genitals, anus, ormouth. Clients who are psychologically abusedexperience threats, insults, or harassment, or arerecipients of harsh commands. Financial abuseoccurs in the form of scams, or by family mem-bers who try to misuse a client's money or pos-Box 10-12 Alcohol Screening Level B recommendation for screening. The USPSTF found good evidence thatscreening is beneficial in identifyingpatients whose alcohol consumptionpatterns place them at risk for increasedmorbidity and mortality, as well as goodevidence that counseling about alcoholreduction can produce a sustained bene-fit over a 6- to 12-month period.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 372 Mental Health Screening 373 sessions. Neglect may be intentional or unin-tentional and occurs when required food, med-ication, or personal care is not provided.Abandonment is a form of neglect wherebysomeone who has agreed to provide care for anelderly client deserts that client. Clients who aredenied the right to make their own decisions,even though they are competent to do so, orwho are not provided privacy or the right toworship are suffering from a violation of theirinalienable rights. Most cases of elder abuse are perpetrated by a family member, and reasons for the abuse includecaregiver burnout and stress, financial worries,transgenerational violence, and psychopathologyin the abuser. Women and dependent elders tendto be the most vulnerable to abuse. Assessment of abuse can be very difficult because the victim may be cognitively impairedand unable to describe the abuse. It is notunusual for elderly clients to have multiplebruises due to poor balance and loss of subcuta-neous fat. Clues to abuse may include: The presence of several injuries in dif- ferent stages of repair Delays in seeking treatment Injuries that cannot be explained or that are inconsistent with the client's history Contradictory explanations by the care- giver and the patient Bruises, burns, welts, lacerations, or restraint marks Dehydration, malnutrition, decubitus ulcers, or poor hygiene Depression, withdrawal, or agitation Signs of medication misuse Pattern of missed or cancelled appoint- ments Frequent changes in health care providers Discharge, bleeding, or pain in rectum or vagina or sexually transmitted disease Missing prosthetic device(s), such as dentures, glasses, or hearing aids The USPSTF decided that there is insufficient evidence to support mass screening of asymp-tomatic elderly clients for abuse, or for the po-tential for abuse. Suspected abuse should beevaluated through a thorough history withpatients, caregivers, and other significant inform-ants, taken separately. Home visits can yieldimportant clues to the situation. Physical exam-ination, including mental status and evaluationof mood, is critical. Laboratory and imaging stud-ies can support suspicions of dehydration, mal-nutrition, medication abuse, and fractures orother injuries. If suspicions are strengthened through this assessment, a collaborative approach to manage-ment and prevention is required. Team membersinclude the adult protective service agency, socialworkers, psychiatrists, lawyers, and law enforce-ment officials. It is important to ascertainwhether the client is in immediate danger, inwhich case law enforcement will be helpful inremoving the client from the dangerous situa-tion. The approach to any abuse case should becoordinated with the adult protective serviceagency, as mandated by law. You should report Box 10-13 Elder Abuse Screening Level I evidence. Insufficient evidence to support mass screening based on insuf-ficient research to support the use ofany particular screening tool, and lackof evidence to support that identifica-tion of risk changes outcomes.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 373 374 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly abuse and neglect within 48 hours of the timethat you become aware of the situation. Elderabuse that occurs in nursing homes and assistedliving facilities must be reported to the long-term care ombudsman program in most states. In summary, guidelines for elder abuse treat- ment recommend that you 1) report abuse andneglect to the adult protective service or otherstate-mandated agencies; 2) ensure that there isa safety plan and assess safety; 3) assess theclient's cognitive, emotional, functional, andhealth status; and 4) assess the frequency, sever-ity, and intent of abuse. It is important that thenurse's involvement does not end with the refer-ral, but includes an ongoing plan of care becauseelderly persons referred to adult protective ser-vices are at increased risk of mortality in thedecade following the referral. Physical Health Screening Heart and Vascular Disease Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leadingcause of death in the United States. Every yearover 1 million Americans have a new or recur-rent myocardial infarction (MI) or die fromcoronary heart disease. Over 25% of patientswho suffer MI or sudden death have no priorwarning symptoms (Greenland, Smith, &Grundy, 2001). Most of these unexpected car-diac events and cases of sudden death occur inpatients over 65 years of age. For this reason,identification of clients at risk for MI who maybe able to benefit from primary preventionstrategies is desirable. National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) IIIdata (2004) suggest that approximately 25% ofU.S. adults may be at high risk for coronaryevent and potential beneficiaries of primary pre-vention strategies. The Framingham Heart Study has eluci- dated many of the risk factors associated withcoronary heart disease. This study began about 50years ago with over 5,000 male and female sub-jects, in order to study cardiovascular risk factors.As a result of decades of epidemiologic work, thefollowing risk factors have been identified: Age /H1135050 for men and 60 for women Hypertension Smoking Obesity Family history of premature CHD Diabetes (considered to be a CHD risk equivalent [i.e., carries the same risk ofcoronary event as known CHD]) Sedentary lifestyle Abnormal lipid levels (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment ofHigh Blood Cholesterol in Adults,2001) Several emerging risk factors, including homocysteine, lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), and infec-tious agents, are currently under investiga-tion. A risk assessment tool developed as aresult of discoveries from the FraminghamStudy may be accessed at http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/atpiii/calculator.asp?usertype=prof. Therisk factors included in the Framingham cal-culation of 10-year risk are age, total cholesterol,HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure,treatment for hypertension, and cigarettesmoking. Patients who have diabetes or ather-osclerotic diseases are known to have a /H1102220% chance of a cardiac event in the next 10 years;the tool is not necessary to calculate risk forthese patients.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 374 Physical Health Screening 375 In order to utilize this risk assessment tool, screening for the cardiac risk factors included inthe tool must be performed. We will examinethese screening guidelines, and the evidence tosupport these screenings, individually.LipidsThere is strong evidence to link elevations intotal cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein(LDL-C), and low levels of high density lipopro-tein (HDL-C) with coronary risk. Four large pri-mary prevention trials documented a 30%reduction in cardiac events for clients whosecholesterol was reduced using statin therapy.Unfortunately, there were very few subjectsolder than 65 years of age in these trials, but theUSPSTF has determined that the results aregeneralizable to the elderly population. There isno age at which the task force recommendsscreening be stopped, but cholesterol levels areunlikely to increase after age 65. For patientswho have been tested and found to have normallevels of cholesterol before the age of 65, testingmay not be necessary in later years. The ratios of TC to HDL-C or LDL-C to HDL-C are better predictors of risk than TCalone. It is possible to accurately measure TCand HDL-C on nonfasting venous or capillaryblood samples, but fasting blood samples arerequired for accurate LDL-C measurement. Twoseparate measurements are required for defini-tive diagnosis. The optimal interval for lipidtesting has not been determined, but mostexpert guidelines support testing every 5 years,with shorter intervals for people who have ele-vated lipid levels and may require therapy.HypertensionFifty million Americans have high blood pres-sure. Older Americans have the highest preva-lence of hypertension and are the least effectivelytreated. Framingham data suggest that clientswho have normal blood pressures at age 55 havea 90% chance of developing hypertension atsome time in their lives. Systolic blood pressure,which is more strongly correlated with CVAs,renal failure, and heart failure than diastolicblood pressure, is the most common form ofhypertension in the elderly and less likely to bewell controlled than diastolic blood pressure.The NHANES study found that among subjects60 years of age older, isolated systolic hyper-tension (systolic /H11350140 with diastolic /H1102190 mm Hg) was present in 65% of cases of high bloodpressure. It is important to diagnose and treat hyper- tension to reduce the incidence of cardiac dis-ease. The correlation of cardiovascular risk andblood pressure is dramatic: Risk doubles witheach increment of 20/10 mm Hg after 115/75.Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension inthe elderly reduced stroke and coronary heartdisease events by 30%, heart failure by 50%,and total mortality by 13%. The Seventh Re-port of the Joint National Committee on Pre-vention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatmentof High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) (2003) is a na-tional guideline for blood pressure screening Box 10-14 Lipid Screening Level A recommendation for screening. There is strong evidence to correlatelipid abnormalities with cardiac risk. Asimple blood test is a valid and reliablemethod of diagnosing lipid abnormali-ties, and diet and drug therapies areeffective remedies.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 375 376 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly and treatment and can be accessed at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/. Blood pressure readings may be accurately determined by a properly calibrated sphygmo-manometer using an appropriately sized cuff(the cuff's bladder needs to encircle at least 80%of the client's arm). Clients should have beenseated in a chair for at least 5 minutes beforeblood pressure is measured. The client's feetshould be uncrossed on the floor and the arm atheart level. Blood pressure measurementsshould be validated by measuring pressure inthe contralateral arm. It is recommended thathypertension be diagnosed only after two ormore elevated readings are obtained on at leasttwo visits over a period of one to several weeks. Lifestyle modifications are effective in pre- venting hypertension and lowering blood pres-sure in clients who have hypertension. Theselifestyle changes include physical activity,weight loss, reducing dietary sodium, and theDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension(DASH) diet, published by the National In- stitutes of Health (NIH) and downloadable fromthe web at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf. This is acomprehensive plan that can be given to patientsand includes a summary of the JNC 7 guidelineson hypertension, the results of studies on theDASH eating plan and its effectiveness in low-ering hypertension, a diet journal, a tutorial onreading and understanding food labels, and mealplans using the DASH diet.Aspirin TherapyAspirin therapy has long been known to beeffective as a secondary prevention strategy forclients with heart disease, but the risks of gas-trointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic strokeassociated with aspirin therapy have delayed rec-ommendations of aspirin as a means of primaryprevention. A meta-analysis of five primary pre-vention trials that showed a 28% reduction ofcardiac disease in subjects (most of whom wereolder than 50) has led experts to recommend\"discussion\" about aspirin chemoprophylaxiswith clients at high risk for developing CHD.Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in about0.3% of subjects given aspirin for 5 years, caus-ing some concerns about the risk versus benefitof aspirin for primary prevention of heart diseasein patients who are at low risk for cardiac illness. Box 10-15 Blood Pressure Screening Level A recommendation. There is strong evidence that blood pressure measure-ment can identify adults at increasedrisk for cardiovascular disease due tohigh blood pressure. Treatment ofhypertension substantially decreases theincidence of cardiovascular disease.Box 10-16 Aspirin Therapy Level A recommendation. There is good evidence that aspirin decreases the inci-dence of CHD in adults who are atincreased risk for heart disease, butaspirin increases the incidence of gas-trointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagicstrokes. The USPSTF concluded thatevidence is strongest to support aspirintherapy in patients at high risk of CHD.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 376 Physical Health Screening 377 Cerebrovascular Disease Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are the thirdleading cause of death in the United States; 87%of these deaths and 74% of all hospitalizationsresulting from CVAs occur in persons age 65 yearsor older. The physical, psychological, economic,and social costs of CVAs are enormously high, toclients as well as their families. Strokes are a sig-nificant cause of dependency among the elderly.The primary risk factors for ischemic stroke aresimilar to those described in the last section onheart disease: increased age, hypertension, smok-ing, and diabetes. Clients with coronary artery dis-ease are at increased risk for stroke, becauseatherosclerotic vessel disease is a common etiologyfor the two diseases. Lifestyle factors associatedwith CVA risk that have been identified by theNational Stroke Association are heavy alcohol use,cigarette smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and a high-fat diet. In addition to these risk factors, atrial fib-rillation and asymptomatic carotid stenosis placeclients at high risk for cerebrovascular disease. It is estimated that 36% of strokes suffered by clients 80-89 years of age are as a result ofnonvalvular atrial fibrillation (National StrokeAssociation, 1999). Adequate anticoagulationwith warfarin therapy in patients with atrial fib-rillation has been found to reduce stroke occur-rence by 68%. Aspirin therapy was found toreduce CVAs by only 21%. It is based on thesedata that National Stroke Association guidelinesrecommend the use of oral anticoagulation withwarfarin for patients older than 75 years of agewith nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Patients 65to 75 years old with atrial fibrillation as well asother CVA risks should be treated with war-farin, and those without additional risk factorsmay be treated with warfarin or aspirin. Theconsensus panel of the Stroke Association under-scores the importance of weighing the risk ofhemorrhage against the benefit of therapy on anindividual patient basis. Carotid stenosis is an important stroke risk factor; however, there is insufficient evidence torecommend screening asymptomatic persons forcarotid artery stenosis, using either physicalexamination or carotid ultrasound. Screening isjustified if early treatment can change clinicaloutcomes and if we have effective, low-riskscreening tests. The inability of experts to rec-ommend screening is based on the fact thatthere is significant debate about the risks andbenefits of carotid endarterectomy as a treat-ment for asymptomatic (1998) recommends carotidendarterectomy asymptomatic whenthe artery is at not recommend carotid ultra-sound for asymptomatic patients based onremaining questions about the risks and bene-fits of carotid endarterectomy as a result of vary-ing surgical risks among studies. Physicalfindings that suggest stenosis, by auscultationof the carotid artery, are a poor predictor of sub-sequent stroke. Experts agree that the risk of a stroke can be minimized through treatment of hypertension;using statin therapy after MI for normal andhigh cholesterol; using warfarin for patientswith atrial fibrillation and specific risk factors,and for patients after MI who have atrial fibril-lation, of lifestyle-related risk factors like smok-ing, alcohol use, physical activity, and diet. Thyroid Disease The USPSTF has found insufficient evidence tosupport screening for thyroid disease in adults.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 377 378 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly Older adults are far more susceptible to thyroiddysfunction than younger adults. Overt diseaseaffects 5% of American adults, but the prevalenceof subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSHwith normal levels of thyroid hormone) is 17.4%among women older than age 75 and 6.2%among men over age 65. Approximately 2%-5%of these cases of subclinical hypothyroidism willprogress to overt hypothyroidism each year. TheAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinolo-gists (AACE) has published clinical guidelines forthe diagnosis and management of thyroid disease(AACE Task Force, 2002), in which it states thatsubclinical hypothyroidism may be associatedwith gastrointestinal disorders, depression, de-mentia, lipid disorders, increased likelihood ofgoiter, and overt thyroid disease. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is far less com- mon in the population, affecting only a littlemore than 1% of adults over 60 years of age, butis present in up to 20% of patients takinglevothyroxine for hypothyroidism. Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, osteoporosis,and neuropsychiatric disorders. Hypothyroidismcan cause and ileus, lipid abnormal-ities, weight gain, decreased cognition, depres-sion, and negative changes in functional status.The goal of screening would be to decrease thenegative effects of overt thyroid disease. The task force's inability to recommend for or against screening of asymptomatic persons forthyroid disease results from the lack of clarityabout the risks of subclinical disease. It is clearthat both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidismcause significant morbidity and need to betreated, but the negative consequences of thesediseases appear to be present primarily in pa-tients who present with symptoms of the dis-ease. There are significant costs and risks associated with thyroid replacement, whichneed to be considered before recommendingmass screening. Many patients who receive thy-roid hormone replacement develop subclinicalhyperthyroidism, which may increase the risk ofdeveloping osteoporosis, hip fracture, and atrialfibrillation. The task force recommends that cli-nicians be cognizant of the signs and symptomsof thyroid disease, and test symptomatic pa-tients. Evidence is lacking to justify screeningof asymptomatic patients, however. The AACEsupports treatment of subclinical hypothyroid-ism if thyroid antibodies are positive. Thyroidantibodies are elevated in Hashimoto's thy-roiditis, the most common cause of subclinicalhypothyroidism. Clients with goiters and posi-tive antibodies are more likely than otherpatients to progress to overt hypothyroidism. Osteoporosis One half of all postmenopausal women will havea fracture related to osteoporosis at some pointin their lives. The risk for the development ofosteoporosis markedly increases with age; osteo-porosis is responsible for 70% of the fracturesthat occur in older adults. Women aged 65-69have six times the risk of osteoporosis thanyounger postmenopausal women, and that rateBox 10-17 Thyroid Disease Screening Level I recommendation. There is insuffi- cient evidence to recommend for oragainst screening based on limited evi-dence to establish health risks of sub-clinical disease and due to the risks oftreatment.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 378 Physical Health Screening 379 increases to 14 times in women aged 75-79.Age, low body mass index (BMI), and failure touse estrogen replacement are the strongest riskfactors for osteoporosis development. Other pos-sible risks include Caucasian or Asian race, fam-ily history of compression or stress fracture, fallrisk or history of fracture, low levels of weight-bearing exercise, smoking, excessive alcohol orcaffeine use, and low intake of calcium or vita-min D. Certain medications, such as thyroidmedication or prednisone, also increase thechances of developing osteoporosis. Some men are at increased risk for osteo- porosis, and decisions about screening may bemade on an individual basis. Men with chroniclung disease, low testosterone levels, and whorequire steroid medications for extended periodsof time are at increased risk of bone loss. There is a strong association between bone mass and fracture risk, which continues into oldage. Multiple studies demonstrate that therapiesthat slow bone loss are effective in reducing frac-ture risk, even if they are begun in old age. The risk associated with age alone was high enough that the USPSTF recommends routinescreening for all women over the age of 65. Ifrisk factors, especially weight less than 70 kgand no estrogen therapy, are present, the taskforce suggests screening women at age 60. Bonedensity testing at the femoral neck by dualenergy x-ray bone densitometry is the gold stan-dard screening tool, and the one that is mostclosely correlated with hip fracture risk, thoughheel measurements, using ultrasonography, arealso predictive of short-term fracture risk. Men are at significantly less risk for osteo- porosis development than are women, and thereare no recommendations for male screening. Vision and Hearing The prevalence of hearing and visual impairmentincreases with age and has been correlated withsocial and emotional isolation, clinical depression,and functional impairment. An objective hearingloss can be identified in over one third of personsages 65 years and older and in up to half ofpatients ages 85 years and older. High-frequencyloss is the most important contributor to thisincrease in hearing loss, though up to 30% of casesmay be caused or compounded by cerumen im-paction or otitis media, which are easily treated. About 4% of adults ages 65-74, and 16% of those 80-84 years of age have bilateral visualacuity worse than 20/40. Macular degenerationis the most common cause of vision loss in elderlyCaucasians, whereas African Americans are morelikely to lose vision as a result of cataracts, glau-coma, and diabetes. Visual impairment has beencorrelated with falls and hip fractures in theelderly (Ivers, Cumming, Mitchell, Simpson, &Peduto, 2003). The Snellen Eye Chart is a useful tool for vision screening. Ophthalmology referral maybe useful for clients whose corrected vision isworse than 20/40, or who report visual problemsthat limit activities such as reading or driving.Many expert panels, including the AmericanAcademy of Ophthalmology, the AmericanOptometric Association, and Prevent Blindness Box 10-18 Osteoporosis Screening Level B recommendation. Osteoporosis is common in the elderly and is correlatedwith fracture risk. There are goodscreening tests to diagnose osteoporosisand effective treatments for the disease.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 379 380 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly America recommend regular ophthalmologicexams for adults over 65 years of age (40 yearsof age for African Americans) based on the factthat effective glaucoma screening should be per-formed by eye specialists with specialized equip-ment to evaluate the optic disc and measurevisual fields. The optimal frequency for glau-coma screening has not yet been determined. Screening older adults for hearing impairment is recommended. Nurses should ask questionsabout hearing changes and make clients aware ofpotential treatments and devices if needed. Pure-tone audiometry has a sensitivity of 92% and aspecificity of 94% for detecting sensorineuralhearing loss. One randomized controlled trialdemonstrated a measurable improvement in so-cial, cognitive, emotional, and communicationfunction in a group of elderly veterans withhearing loss when they were fitted for and usedhearing aids (Mulrow et al., 1990). It can some-times be difficult for elderly individuals to adjustto the use of hearing aids, but compliance rates ofclose to 40%-60% have been documented.Hearing aids can improve communication, socialfunction, and emotional well-being. Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is both the second most commonform of cancer among U.S. men and the secondleading cause of cancer death in U.S. men. Therisk of developing prostate cancer increases withage; in fact, more than 75% of cases are diag-nosed in men aged 65 and older, and this groupaccounts for 90% of deaths due to prostate can-cer. The disease is most prevalent in AfricanAmericans and least prevalent among AsianAmericans. Two tests are commonly used in prostate can- cer screening: the digital rectal exam (DRE) andthe prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test.DRE has a sensitivity of less than 60% and verypoor inter-rater reliability. Sensitivity is im-proved by combining the PSA and DRE, butspecificity, the risk of false-positive testing, suf-fers as a result of combined testing. Benign pro-static hypertrophy is common in older men, andthe presence of this disease increases the likeli-hood of false positive testing with the PSA. Approximately 25% of prostate cancers are slow-growing and unlikely to be a cause of sig-nificant morbidity and mortality in older men.The greatest controversy regarding screening forprostate cancer is the inability to accurately pre-dict which cancers will be aggressive and requiretreatment, and which are unlikely to metastasize.

The task force recommends screening older adults forhearing loss by asking them about theirhearing, counseling them about hearingaids, and referring them to specialistswhen abnormalities are detected. Box 10-20 Prostate Cancer Screening Level I recommendation. There is insuffi- cient evidence to recommend screeningbased on inconclusive evidence thatscreening with DRE and PSA improveshealth outcomes. Men with a lifeexpectancy of less than 10 years areunlikely to benefit from prostatescreening.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 380 Physical Health Screening 381 Seventy percent of cancers detected by PSA and DRE screening are confined to the prostate.There are two methods to treat these organ-confined cancers: radiation and prostatectomy.There are no large randomized controlled tri-als that demonstrate the effectiveness of eitherof these methods compared to \"watchful wait-ing\" in treating screening-identified, organ-confined prostate cancer. A large clinical trialsponsored by the National Cancer Institute iscurrently underway. The Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trial is designed to determine whether prostate screen-ing and early detection of prostate cancer improvepatient outcomes (National Cancer Institute,2001). The PLCO study's preliminary findingssuggest that the frequency of screening mayneed to be less often than commonly performed.Five-year intervals between PSA/ DRE screen-ings may be sufficient for most men with lowlevels of PSA. Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongU.S. women, and the prevalence of the diseaseincreases with age. Half of all cases of breast can-cer occur in women over 65 and 13% of womenover 65 years of age will be diagnosed withbreast cancer. Other risk factors for the diseaseinclude family history of breast cancer, atypicalhyperplasia in breast tissue, and birth of a firstchild when a woman is over 30 years of age. TheUSPSTF examined whether breast cancerscreening by mammography was beneficial inolder women. Although disease prevalence ishigh in this population, the task force wonderedwhether early detection of disease would im-prove health outcomes in a population that alsohas a higher incidence of other chronic illnesses.They wondered if there was an upper age limitat which breast cancer screening would nolonger be beneficial. There have been no studiesthat analyzed screening for women over 74 yearsof age, but the task force concluded that, unlessa woman has significant comorbidity that willsignificantly limit her life expectancy, screeningis warranted based on the high mortality fromthe disease in older women. Screening tests used to detect breast cancer include mammography, clinical breast exam bya health care provider, and self breast exam. Thesensitivity of mammography to detect breastcancer varies widely, depending on a woman'sage, whether she takes hormonal replacement,the technical quality of the testing equipment,and the skill of the radiologist. Overall, the sen-sitivity of the test is better for older women thanit is for younger women. Unfortunately, thereare many false positive tests, and up to one quar-ter of women who have annual mammogramsmay need to undergo unnecessary, invasive fol-low-up testing as a result of false-positive tests Box 10-21 Breast Cancer Screening with Mammography (with or without clinical breast exam) Level B evidence. There is fair evidence to support benefit from breast cancerscreening for older women by mammo-gram every 1 to 2 years. There is no ageat which screening should be discontin-ued, but the task force agrees thatscreening would have no benefit whenlife expectancy is significantly limitedby dementia or other serious, life-limiting chronic illnesses.28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 381 382 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly from mammography. There have been no studiesto look at the effectiveness of clinical breastexam without concurrent mammography todetect breast cancer. Self breast exam has notbeen found to decrease breast cancer morbidityor mortality, but there have not been enoughstudies to evaluate the issue. Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is both the third most com-mon cancer in the United States and the thirdleading cause of cancer death in the UnitedStates. The prevalence of the disease increaseswith age, and over 90% of colorectal cancer isdiagnosed in clients over the age of 50. There are several good screening methodolo- gies to detect early colon cancer: fecal occultblood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, and col-onoscopy. Choice of screening test is determinedbased on client risk factors and preference.Patients who have a history of adenomatouspolyps or inflammatory bowel disease or a fam-ily history of colorectal cancer or adenomatouspolyps should receive colonoscopy. Screening forthese high risk clients is begun at an earlier agethan for the general population. Colonoscopy is the most sensitive of the screening methodologies but is associated withthe highest costs and risks. These risks includea small risk of perforation and bleeding and therisks associated with sedation required for theprocedure. Commonly used screening strategies for clients of average risk include annual FOBT, sig-moidoscopy performed every 5 years, or a combi-nation of FOBT performed annually withsigmoidoscopy every 5 years, when FOBT test-ing is negative. If the results of this test are pos-itive, clients are sent for colonoscopy or doublecontrast barium enema combined with sigmoid-oscopy, in cases colonoscopy not avail-able. The best methodololgy for FOBT is thethree consecutive stool samples that are collectedat home by the patient on an annual basis. Thesetests should be examined without rehydrationdue to the decreased specificity of the test that isassociated with rehydration of the samples. A sin-gle guiaic test, performed in the office with DRE,is not recommended as an adequate screening test(National Guideline Clearinghouse, 2005). There is strong evidence to support colorec- tal screening for men and women ages 50 andolder, but insufficient evidence to determinewhich of the various screening options is thepreferred method for screening. Box 10-23 Colorectal Screening Level A recommendation. The task force strongly recommends colorectal screen-ing by FOBT, FOBT /H11001sigmoidoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy alone for clients withaverage risk of developing colorectalcancer. The task force was unable todetermine whether the increased sensi-tivity of colonoscopy compared withthe other screening methods out-weighed the costs, risks, and inconven-ience of the procedure.Box 10-22 Clinical breast exam screening: Level I evidence.

Although Hilde had a minorstroke 3 years ago, she has not been intothe office for the past year because shelacks transportation since she gave updriving 2 years ago due to her poorvision. Roxanne has encouraged hermother to move into an assisted livingfacility, but Hilde is loathe to sell herhome of 50 years and to give up herindependence. What screening tests are appropriate for Hilde at this time? Justify yourchoices. What instruments will you useto perform the appropriate screeningtests? What counseling will you providefor Mrs. M. and her daughter, based onthe limited information you have beenprovided?You are working as an RN for a managed care organization. Physicianshave complained about their inabilityto adequately care for their elderlypatients given the time constraintsimposed by the 20-minute office visit.An innovative strategy, in which RNsmeet with all clients over the age of 65on an annual basis, prior to the physi-cian visit, in order to ensure that rec-ommended screening tests are performed,has been instituted by the HMO. You are visiting with Hilde M., an 82-year-old female, who is accompaniedby her daughter, Roxanne. Roxannehas called you prior to the visit toinform you about her concerns abouther mother's ability to live safely aloneat home. She confides that her motheris forgetting many appointments, and Case Study 10-128438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 383 384 Chapter 10: Identifying and Preventing Common Risk Factors in the Elderly Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Iola R., a 72-year-old overweight woman, tells you that she wishes that she could exer- cise, but that she can never bring herself to begin an exercise program. She knows thather hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol would benefit from regular exercise.She is caring for her grandchildren 3 days per week and can't find the time to engagein regular exercise. She is not sure if it is safe to walk alone around her neighborhoodanyway. Explain how you could use the concepts of self-management of chronic ill-ness and contracting to help Iola begin an exercise program. What benefits might sheobtain through regular exercise? How frequently should she plan to exercise? 2. Mr. Gottlieb complains that he has been falling a lot recently. He can remember at least three falls in the past 6 months, but, luckily, none have resulted in injury yet.His friend is living in a nursing home as a result of complications and debility thatfollowed a hip fracture, and Mr. Gottlieb does not want the same fate for himself.Please describe how you will assess and manage Mr. Gottlieb's fall risk. 3. Mrs. Hall is a 94-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. Her daughter is her pri- mary caregiver and calls to report that caring for her mother has become intolerable.\"I can't make her eat, drink, or stop her incessant whining.\" You notice that Mrs. Hallhas not been in to see her primary care doctor in over 3 years, but that she has beenin to the emergency department four times in the past year for dehydration, urinarytract infections, and behavior management. You want to assess the home situation forsafety and provide caregiver support to the patient's daughter. What signs of abuseand neglect might you look for through a chart review? Through a clinic visit andevaluation of the client? Through laboratory testing? How could you get a betterassessment of the actual home situation? If your suspicions are strengthened, how willyou proceed to intervene with this case of suspected elder abuse and neglect?28438_CH10_355_388.qxd 6/7/06 4:30 PM Page 384 Glossary 385 Activities of daily living (ADLs): Activities performed in the course of daily life that include bathing,dressing, transferring, walking, eating, andcontinence.

In the case described in #3 of the Critical Thinking Exercises, which of the two clients described, Mrs. H. or her daughter who initially called you, is your primary patient?Do you have loyalties to both? How could you address the care needs of Mrs. H.'sdaughter? 2. Do you feel that you can counsel a client about health promotion if you do not adopt these behaviors yourself? 3. Mr. J., an 88-year-old gentleman, had a colonoscopy 6 years ago in which an ade- nomatous polyp was removed. His gastroenterologist has asked for your help in bring-ing Mr. J. back for follow-up testing. You call the patient, who tells you that althoughhe recognizes the risk, he is not willing to undergo the procedure again. He believeshis life expectancy is limited anyway, and would prefer to not know if he has anotherpolyp because he would not want to undergo surgery anyway. What do you do?

It is assumedthat the reader of this text has fundamentalnursing knowledge and will study diseaseprocesses more in depth in other courses.Extensive discussion of the nursing care andtreatment of each disease is beyond the scope ofthis book, but nurses are encouraged to refer totraditional medical-surgical textbooks for fur-ther reading. The discussion in this chapter willuse a systems approach to provide essentialinformation regarding background, risk factors,signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and usual treat-ment, while emphasizing any important aspectsunique to care of the elderly with each disorder.Chapter 12 provides a thorough discussion ofsome additional common problems.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 393 394 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions Cardiovascular Problems Several conditions and diseases related to the car-diovascular system are common in older adults.The specific conditions discussed in this sectioninclude myocardial infarction, hypertension,angina, congestive heart failure, coronary arterydisease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. The American Heart Association (AHA) stated that in 2002, cardiovascular disease ac-counted for 38% of all deaths in the UnitedStates (2005a). There are more than 27 millionAmerican adults age 65 or older with some formof cardiovascular disease (CVD), making it a sig-nificant health problem among the elderly. Inthe United States, 38% of all deaths in 2002were attributed to CVD (AHA, 2005a). InCanada, 34% of all male deaths and 36% of allfemale deaths in 2000 were due to heart diseaseand stroke (Heart and Stroke Foundation ofCanada, 2005). The AHA lists the following asthe major cardiovascular diseases: hypertension (HTN) , and stroke . These will be discussed in the following sections. Hypertension Approximately 65 million Americans have ablood pressure of 140/90 or higher, have beendiagnosed with hypertension (HTN), or have highblood pressure. African American males have thehighest incidence of HTN of all groups, resultingin an increase in the number of strokes and heartdisease in this population. Blacks have a 1.8 timesgreater risk than whites of having a fatal stroke,and 4.2 times greater chance of developing endstage renal disease (AHA, 2005a). Blood pressure is determined by many fac- tors, some of which, such as the condition of theheart and blood vessels, are influenced by age. Over 95% of hypertension is called \"essential\"hypertension, that is, it has no known cause(National Institutes of Health, 2005). Highblood pressure may also result from diseaseprocesses. Additionally, those with prehyperten-sion, a systolic blood pressure between 120 and139 or a diastolic blood pressure between 80 and89 on multiple readings, should receive a rec-ommendation to make lifestyle changes, becauseBox 11-1 Resources About Cardiovascular Disease American Heart Association 1-800-AHA-USA11-800-242-8721www.americanheart.org American Society of Hypertension (ASH) www.ash-us.org American Stroke Association 1-888-4-STROKE1-888-478-7653www.strokeassociation.org Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada www.heartandstroke.ca Heart and Stroke Foundation of Alberta, Canadaww2.heartandstroke.ab.ca National Emergency Medical Association www.nemahealth.org National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokewww.ninds.nih.gov National Stroke Association www.stroke.org South African Heart Association www.saheart.org28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 394 Cardiovascular Problems 395 they often develop hypertension. Diagnosis ofhypertension should be based on several readingsat different times or visits to the physician. Risk factors for hypertension include family history, ethnicity, poor diet, being overweight,excessive alcohol intake, a sedentary lifestyle,and certain medications ( Table 11-1 ). A blood pressure consistently under 120/80 is desirable.As persons age, the systolic blood pressure (themeasure of the heart at work) tends to rise, butbecause of the significant risk of stroke associ-ated with hypertension, older adults are beingtreated earlier and more aggressively than inyears past. Although some clinicians may con-sider HTN in the elderly as a blood pressuregreater than 160/90, because of the rise in sys-tolic blood pressure with age those with isolatedsystolic HTN (i.e., a systolic BP over 140 and adiastolic BP less than 90) should be aggressivelytreated (Reuben et al., 2004). Lifestyle modifications may help older adults to control blood pressure. Table 11-2 lists rec- ommended strategies for older adults. Severalmedications may be used to treat hypertension inthe elderly ( Table 11-3 ). The goal of medical treatment in older adults is to lower the bloodpressure to between 140/90 and 120/80. Thiazidediuretics or beta blockers are often used as drugsof choice for the elderly who do not have othercoexisting medical conditions. It is not uncom-mon for older adults to require more than one andeven up to several medications to achieve adequatecontrol. In fact, combination therapy for olderadults \"allows for smaller doses of each drug andthus avoids unpleasant side effects\" (Tully, 2002,p. 36). The most common combinations are a thi-azide diuretic with either a potassium-sparingdiuretic, a beta blocker, or a calcium agonist. Older adults should work with their physi- cians and nurses to achieve good control of theirblood pressure, because it is a risk factor andcontributor to many other serious health con-ditions including heart disease and stroke.Nurses may need to do extensive teaching aboutlifestyle modifications to assist older adults withsmoking cessation and appropriate dietarychoices. Remember that in addition to promot-ing nutrition, nurses should teach patients toread labels, avoid processed foods, prepare foodsappropriately, and drink adequate amounts offluids to stay hydrated. Coronary Heart Disease Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coro- nary artery disease (CAD) or ischemic heart disease, affects millions of people each year inmany countries. This condition is caused byhardening and narrowing of the blood vessels ofthe heart ( atherosclerosis ), resulting in an impaired blood supply to the myocardium.Thirteen million Americans are affected eachyear. The rates for older females after menopauseare more than twice that of older females priorto menopause. Over 83% of people who dieTable 11-1 sodium intakeDiabetes Some medications Source: AHA, 2005.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 395 396 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions with CHD are age 65 years and over (AHA,2005a). Myocardial infarction and angina aretwo results of CHD that will be discussed here.AnginaAngina pectoris is chest pain that results fromlack of oxygen to the heart muscle. A small num-ber of deaths are attributed to this cause each year,but mortality statistics related to angina are oftenincluded with CHD reports. Only about 20% ofheart attacks are preceded by diagnosed angina.Among Americans ages 40-74, the prevalence ofangina is slightly higher for females, significantlyhigher for Mexican American males and females,and slightly higher, though not significantly so,for African American females (AHA, 2005a).Table 11-2 Strategies to Help Older Adults Control High Blood Pressure Limit alcohol intake to one drink per day.Limit sodium intake.Stop smoking.Maintain a low fat diet that still contains adequate vitamins and minerals by adding leafy green vegetables and fruits. Do some type of aerobic activity nearly every day of the week.Lose weight (even 10 pounds may make a significant difference).Have blood pressure checked regularly. Report any significant rise in blood pressure to the physician. Take medications as ordered. Do not skip doses.

It is classified as stable or unsta-ble. Although the symptoms of angina may besimilar to myocardial infarction, there are severaldifferences that are of note. Angina often occursrelated to exercise or stress and is relieved by restand/or nitroglycerin. The associated chest pain isgenerally shorter (less than 5 minutes) than MI,though the classic presentation is squeezing painor pressure in the sternal area. Older adults withangina may first complain of dyspnea, dizziness,or confusion versus classic chest pain (Tully,2002). In addition to a thorough history andchecking vital signs, a 12-lead EKG and lab testswill help rule out or confirm an MI. Treatment is ongoing for angina. Unstable angina may require hospitalization, whereasstable angina can be managed with medicationand lifestyle modifications aimed at reducingthe workload on the heart and the accompa-nying oxygen demand. Teaching of patientsand families will include weight management,stress management, limiting caffeine, smok-ing cessation, an exercise regimen that con-siders the person's myocardial capacity, controlof hypertension, and (such ashyperthyroidism). Beta blockers and calciumchannel blockers are often prescribed to de-crease the oxygen demand on the heart. Pa-tients should be alerted to side effects fromthese medications such as fatigue, drowsiness,dizziness, and slow heart rate.Myocardial InfarctionThere are 365,000 new and 300,000 recurrentheart attacks each year in the United States. Therisk of MI increases with age, with an averageage for a person's first MI of 65.8 for men and70.4 for women (AHA, 2005a). In Canada,70,000 persons are affected by MI each year,with 20,926 dying of heart attack in 1999(Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, 2005). Risk factors for MI include hypertension, race (especially African American males with HTN),high fat diet, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, obe-sity, high cholesterol, family history, cigarettesmoking, excessive alcohol intake, and stressfulenvironment. Many of these risk factors aremodifiable or controllable. Warning signs of MIare listed in Table 11-4 . \"Thrombolytic therapy, if administered early in the course of MI, significantly reduces themorbidity and mortality associated with MI\"(Tully, 2002, p. 40). The following steps are rec-ommended if possible while awaiting emer-gency treatment: 1. Have the patient rest.2. Provide supplemental oxygen.3. Give nitroglycerin sublingually every 5 minutes times three and monitor vitalssigns. 4. Give aspirin if not contraindicated.

Diagnosis may include a variety of tests in- cluding EKG and angiogram or cardiac catheter-ization to visualize any areas of blockage. Figure 11-1 shows the results of an angiogram with some degree of blockage in a major heart vessel.Such procedures are generally done in a specialcath lab within a heart center or hospital by a Figure 11-1 Coronary angiogram illustrating segmental narrowing ( arrows ).

Important nursing interventionsafter these procedures include keeping the legstraight with pressure on the femoral artery entrysite per the facility's protocol. Instruction of thepatient and family after this outpatient proce-dure should include emphasis on the importanceof monitoring the entry site. Patients should betaught that bleeding at the site is considered anemergency and that firm, direct pressure mustbe applied to the site immediately. It is commonfor bruising to occur, and limits to lifting anddriving should be strictly followed postproce-dure to prevent complications. Usual medical treatment of MI includes sev- eral options, depending on the results of thediagnostic tests and extent of damage and block-age. Angioplasty ( Figure 11-2 ) is a common procedure that uses a balloon or other device toopen the blocked vessel.

Table 11-5 lists several strategies for older adults to prevent a first or recurring heartattack. Nurses should encourage patients to at-tend cardiac rehabilitation programs during theposthospitalization period. Zucker (2002) statedthat \"unless patients are consistently referred tocardiac rehabilitation or are followed closely afterdischarge, they have little support as they attemptto incorporate and maintain new, healthier behav-iors\" (p. 187). Support groups for survivors andfamilies may also be helpful. Family members,particularly spouses, should be included in therehabilitation process ( Case Study 11-1 ). Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) The incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF)is 10 per 1,000 people over the age of 65. Thelifetime risk for someone to have CHF is 1 in 5.The risk of CHF in older adults doubles forthose with blood pressures over 160/90.Seventy-five percent of those with CHF alsohave hypertension (AHA, 2005a). The majorrisk factors for CHF are diabetes and MI. CHFoften occurs within 6 years after a heart attack. Signs and symptoms of heart failure are many; these appear in Table 11-6 . It is essentialthat older adults diagnosed with CHF recognizesigns of a worsening condition and report thempromptly to their health care provider. Olderadults may present with atypical symptomssuch as decreased appetite, weight gain of a fewpounds, or insomnia (Amella, 2004). In theoffice or long-term care setting, O 2saturation levels can be easily monitored. An O2satura- tion of less than 90% in an older person is causefor concern and further investigation. Treatment for CHF involves the usual lifestyle modifications discussed for promotinga healthy heart (Table 11-5), as well as severalpossible types of medications. CHF managed with lifestyle mod-ifications and medications; however, in extremecases, surgery may be a treatment option if val-vular repair/replacement or heart transplant be-comes necessary. In addition, nurses should teach older adults about lifestyle modifications that can decreaseand/or help manage the workload on the heart.To minimize exacerbations, patient and familyTable 11-5 Strategies for Older Adults to Reduce Risk of Heart Attack Exercise regularly.Do not smoke.Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables; avoid foods high in saturated fats.Maintain a healthy weight.Manage stress appropriately.Control existing diabetes by maintaining healthy blood sugars and take medications as prescribed.Limit alcohol intake to 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day (or less) for men. Visit the doctor regularly. After a heart attack, participate fully in a cardiac rehabilitation program.Involve the entire family in heart-healthy lifestyle modifications. Report any signs of chest pain immediately.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 401 402 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions counseling should include teaching about theuse of medications to control symptoms and theimportance of regular monitoring with a healthcare provider (Johnson, 1999). These appear inTable 11-7 . With a proper combination of treatments such as lifestyle changes and med-ications, many older persons can still live happyand productive lives with a diagnosis of heartfailure, and minimize their risk of complicationsrelated to this disease. Stroke Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular acci- dent (CVA) or brain attack, is an interruption of the blood supply to the brain that may resultin devastating neurological damage and dis-ability or death. Approximately 700,000 peoplein the United States have a new or recurrentstroke each year (ASA, 2005). Stroke accountedfor 1 in 15 deaths in 2002, making it the thirdleading cause of death. In Canada, stroke is the2. What could these signs and symptoms indicate? 3. What would you expect Mr. Jones to do at this point? 4.

Assessment and DiagnosisThere are two major types of stroke: ischemic andhemorrhagic. The vast majority of strokes arecaused by ischemia (88%), usually from a throm-bus or embolus. The symptoms and damage seendepend on which vessels in the brain are blocked.Carotid artery occlusion is also a common causeof stroke related to stenosis ( Figure 11-4 ). Some risk factors for stroke are controllable and others are not. These risk factors appear inTable 11-8 . The most significant risk factor for stroke is hypertension. Controlling high bloodpressure is an important way to reduce strokerisk. Those with a blood pressure of less than120/80 have half the lifetime risk of stroke asthose with hypertension (ASA, 2005). Althoughthe American Stroke Association and the Na-tional Stroke Association have funded nationalcampaigns to promote education about thewarning signs of stroke, in persons age 75 orolder, blacks and males were found to be theleast knowledgeable about these signs (ASA,2005), emphasizing the continued need for edu-cation among older age groups. Smoking 40 ormore cigarettes per day (heavy smoking) in-creases the stroke risk to twice that of lightsmokers. If a person quits smoking, their riskafter 5 years mirrors that of a nonsmoker, soolder adults should be particularly encouragedto stop smoking. Several warning signs are common with stroke (Table 11-9) . Thromboembolic strokes are more likely to show classic signs than hemorrhagicstrokes that may appear as severe headaches butwith few other prior warning signs. A quick ini-tial evaluation for stroke can be summed up byassessing for three easy signs: facial droop, motorweakness, and language difficulties. Other warning signs of stroke include a tem- porary loss of consciousness or the appearance ofthe classic warning signs that go away quickly(Case Study 11-2 ). Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are defined as those symptoms similar to stroke that go away within 24 hours (and usuallywithin minutes) and leave no residual effects. MostTIAs in whites are from atherothrombotic disease,Table 11-7 Lifestyle Modifications to Teach Older Adults with Heart Failure Limit or eliminate alcohol use (no more than 1 oz. ethanol per day /H11005one mixed drink, one 12 oz. beer, or one 5 oz. glass of wine).

At least10% of those having a TIA will go on to have astroke within a year (ASA, 2005). Older adults experiencing the warning signs of stroke should seek immediate treatment byactivating the emergency response system intheir area. Transport to an emergency medicalfacility for evaluation is essential for the bestarray of treatment options. A history and neu-rological exam, vital signs, as well as diagnostictests including electrocardiogram (ECG), chestx-ray, platelets, prothrombin time (PT), partialthromboplastin time (PTT), contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),arteriography, or ultrasonography to determinethe type and location of the stroke.

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 404 Cardiovascular Problems 405 Acute ManagementThe first step in treatment is to determine thecause or type of stroke. A CT scan or MRI mustfirst be done to rule out hemorrhagic stroke(Figure 11-5 ). Hemorrhagic stroke treatment often requires surgery to evacuate blood andstop the bleeding. The gold standard at present for treatment of ischemic stroke is t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator ). At this time, t-PA must be given within 3 hours after the onset of stroke symp-toms. This is why it is essential that older adultsseek treatment immediately when symptomsbegin. T-PA is ineffective after the 3-hour win-dow. New treatments are being explored toextend this window, including the use of a syn-thetic compound derived from bat saliva thatcontains an anticoagulant-type property. Themajor side effect of t-PA is bleeding. T-PA is noteffective for all patients, but may reduce oreliminate symptoms in over 40% of those whoreceive it at the appropriate time (Higashida,2005). Other much less common proceduressuch as angioplasty, laser emulsification, andmechanical clot retrieval may be options fortreatment of acute ischemic stroke. Additionally, the use of cooling helmets to decrease the metabolism of the brain is thoughtto preserve function and reduce ischemic dam-age. The roles of hyperthermia, hyperglycemia,and hypertension are all being further explored,as these are known to be associated with mortal-ity and other poor outcomes related to ischemicstroke. To prevent recurrence of stroke, medications such as aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), Plavix,dipyridamole (Persantine), heparin, coumadin,and lovenox may be used prevent clot for-mation. Once the stroke survivor has stabilized,the long process of rehabilitation begins. Eachstroke is different depending on location andseverity, so persons may recover with little or noresidual deficits, or an entire array of devastat-ing consequences. The effects of stroke vary, but may include hemiplegia , hemiparesis , visual and perceptual deficits, language deficits, emotional changes,swallowing dysfunction, and bowel and bladderproblems. Although the deficits that presentthemselves depend on the area of brain damage,it is sometimes helpful to picture most strokes asinvolving one side of the body or the other. Aperson with left brain injury presents with right-sided weakness or paralysis, and a person withTable 11-8 Risk Factors for Stroke Controllable UncontrollableHypertension Advanced ageHigh cholesterol Gender (males moreHeart disease than females until Smoking menopause)Obesity Race (African Stress Americans more Diabetes than whites) Heredity Table 11-9 Warning Signs of Stroke Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause Source: NSA, 2005, p. 1.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 405 406 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions 2.

Table 11-10 lists common deficits caused by stroke, seen in varying degrees,and some common problems associated withstrokes on one side of the brain versus the other.Post-stroke RehabilitationRehabilitation after a stroke focuses on severalkey principles. These include maximizing func-tional ability, preventing complications, pro-moting quality of life, encouraging adaptation,and enhancing independence. Rehabilitationemphasizes the survivor's abilities, not disabili-ties, and helps him or her to work with what heor she has while acknowledging what was lost. If significant functional impairments are present, evaluation for transfer to an intensiveacute inpatient rehabilitation program is rec-ommended. Inpatient rehabilitation units offerthe survivor the best opportunity to maximizerecovery, including functional return. An inter-disciplinary team of experienced experts includ-ing nurses, therapists, physicians, social workers,and psychologists will help the survivor and thefamily to adapt to the changes resulting fromthe stroke. Although the goal of rehabilitationwill usually be discharge back to the previoushome environment, this is not always possible.Advanced age and functional capacity, particu-larly ambulatory ability, may be predictors ofdischarge to a nursing home (Lutz, 2004). Research by Easton (Mauk) (1999, 2001) demonstrated through grounded theory devel-opment that stroke survivors seem to go througha common process of recovery ( Box 11-2). The Mauk model for poststroke recovery can28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 406 Cardiovascular Problems 407 help guide nursing practice by suggestingfocused interventions for each of the six phasesof stroke recovery. Tables 11-11 and 11-12 list the major concepts and subconcepts of themodel ( Figure 11-6 ) and the major tasks for survivors and nurses. Many survivors will need time to work through the first two phases of stroke recov-ery: agonizing and fantasizing. During thistime, the person may be in denial about theconsequences of the stroke and feel that sooneverything will go back to \"normal.\" Familymembers also may express these feelings.Survival and ego protection are the main goalsof these early phases. The length of time a sur-vivor spends in these early phases of recoverymay be buffered by certain factors, as pre-sented in the model. For example, older adultsmay spend less time agonizing over what hashappened because they expected some healthproblems would come with advanced age,whereas younger persons may struggle moreFigure 11-5 CT scan showing cerebral hemorrhage.

As suggested by the Mauk model, once a stroke survivor has been medically stabilizedand realizes the reality of the stroke situation,the focus of care will shift from survival to adap-tation and adjustment. Nursing diagnoses com-mon to stroke rehabilitation appear in Table 11-13 . The Mauk model suggests that survivors do not fully participate in the recovery or reha-bilitation process until they work through therealizing phase in which they begin to acknowl-edge that the effects of the stroke may not justgo away. During this time, strong emotionssuch as anger and depression may surface.Depression is common after stroke, and may bedecreased by interventions that support theolder adult's right to make choices and be sup-ported in self-determination activities thatenhance autonomy (Castellucci, 2004). Asstroke survivors continue to receive support andappropriate interventions to facilitate the recov-28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 408 Cardiovascular Problems 409 ery process, they move into the last three phasesof blending the old life with the new (afterstroke), framing the experience in light of pastand familiar experiences, and owning the factthat the stroke occurred and they will accept itand go on with a productive life. A qualitative,longitudinal study of patient expectations ofrecovery after stroke showed that stroke sur-vivors maintained high expectations for recov-ery during the first 3 months (Wiles, Ashburn,Payne, & Murphy, 2002). Realistic expectationscan be reinforced by therapists and nurses, butit is important not to destroy hope of an in-creased quality of life.Patient and Family EducationA large amount of teaching is often done bystroke rehabilitation nurses who work witholder survivors. Training informal caregivers hasbeen shown to improve quality of life for strokesurvivors and their caregivers, and to decreasecosts over time (Kalra et al., 2004). Many top-ics may need to be covered, depending on theextent of brain damage that has occurred. Sometopics should be addressed with all survivorsand their families. These include knowing the warning signs of stroke and how to activate the emergency response system in their neighbor-hood, managing high blood pressure (and howBox 11-2 Research Highlight Aim: To discover the process of recovery after stroke Methods: Using grounded theory development, a concept analysis, concept synthesis, and subsequent theory synthesis was done. The researcher reviewed the literature on the writ-ings as well as videotapes of stroke survivors as initial data. From this theoretical work, amodel with six phases of poststroke recovery emerged. The researcher then conductedface-to-face interviews with stroke survivors until data saturation ( n/H1100518) was reached, refining concepts and subconcepts of the model. Findings: The six phases of poststroke recovery emerging from the data were labeled in a model: agonizing, fantasizing, realizing, blending, framing, and owning. Assumptionsand relational propositions were suggested by the model. The researcher further identi-fied essential tasks for each phase (Table 11-12). These phases describe the process ofpoststroke recovery. Certain factors seemed to facilitate the recovery process includingsocial and spousal support, expectations related to health, advanced age, faith in God, lifeexperience in dealing with losses, and knowing the cause of the stroke. Conclusion: By using the Mauk model for poststroke recovery, nurses can more efficiently target their care by focusing nursing interventions unique to the phase of recovery inwhich survivors are. Nurses should assess the phase of recovery and focus care interven-tions related to the essential tasks for each phase. Source: Easton-Mauk, K. L. (2001).

All survivors will need assistance in re-integrating into the community. This is gener-ally begun in the rehabilitation setting. Family caregivers of stroke survivors must also deal with many issues. A classic study by Mumma(1986) revealed that stroke patients and theirspouses perceived losses in such areas as mobility,traveling, the ability to do certain desired activ-ities, and independence. A study by Pierce andcolleagues (2004) revealed that families dealingwith stroke survivors identified five top self-careneeds that they wished to have informationabout: preventing falls, maintaining adequatenutrition, staying active, managing stress, anddealing with emotional and mood changes.

Both results demonstrate a needfor teaching that goes beyond what is taught inthe traditional hospital setting. Pierce et al.(2004) also found that using an Internet-basedsupport group for rural caregivers produced pos-itive responses and suggested common problemsthat caregivers face. These include such things aschanging roles, problem solving, feeling con-nected with the family and survivor, using spiri-tuality to cope, and balancing feelings of successin adapting with losses that have occurred. Some stroke survivors will have dysphagia and may return home on a feeding tube, soteaching about nutritional requirements, tubemanagement, and administering medicationsvia the tube will be important. Many survivorswill continue to benefit from outpatient thera-pies in occupational therapy, physical therapy,and/or speech therapy. Some will need referralsto vocational counseling if they wish to returnto work. Others may need to follow up with anorthotist for splints or other orthotic devices. Outcomes for geriatric stroke survivors are enhanced by intensive rehabilitation programs,whether offered in rehabilitation units or inskilled nursing facilities (Jett, Warren, & Wirtalla,2005). Table 11-14 presents general approaches to care of stroke suvivors. Generally, advanced ageis considered to be a negative factor in recoveryfrom stroke, but factors such as motivation andhope must also be considered in the rehabilitationprocess. In addition, much of the research litera-ture regarding functional level of recovery afterstroke suggests that return of function peaked anddid not significantly progress much after the 3-6month mark poststroke. Easton's (Mauk) research(1999, 2001) as well as other emerging researchsuggests that survivors can and do continue tomake improvements in daily function even yearsafter their strokes. Much of this improvement maybe in the area of instrumental activities of dailyFigure 11-6 The Mauk model of poststroke recovery. Agonizing Blending Framing 28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 411 412 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions living (IADLS) , or home activities that the sur- vivor wished to resume after the stroke. However,new research out of the Cincinnati College ofMedicine in Ohio suggests that even mental prac-tice of upper arm mobility may have a significantand positive impact on the stroke survivor's abil-ity to use the affected upper limb (Page, Levine,& Leonard, 2005). In summary, stroke is a condition that affects millions of Americans and can lead to significantchronic functional limitations and decreasedquality of life. It is hopeful for survivors, how-ever, that stroke is not a degenerative or chronicdisease. Improvements can be seen after manyyears in areas that enhance quality of life for sur-vivors and their families. Nurses should continueto follow research trends related to treatment ofacute stroke and to educate survivors and theirfamilies about the recovery process. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Peripheral artery disease (PAD) , the most common type of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) , affects 8-12 million Americans, 12%-20% of those over the age of 65. The riskfactors for PAD are the same as those for CHD,Table 11-13 Common Problems Related to Stroke Nursing Diagnoses Alteration in tissue perfusion: cerebralAlteration in tissue perfusion: peripheralImpaired swallowingIneffective nutrition: less than body requirementsAlteration in bowel elimination (constipation, diarrhea) Alteration in urinary elimination (incontinence, retention) Impaired physical mobilityUnilateral neglectAltered sensory perceptionSelf-care deficits (related to toileting, dressing, eating, bathing) Impaired communication Activity intoleranceDecreased enduranceHigh risk for impaired skin integrity High risk for injuryAltered role performanceSpiritual distressHopelessnessPowerlessnessPainSelf-esteem Easton, 1999, p. 196; used with permission of author.Common Medical Complications After Stroke Pressure ulcersShoulder dysfunctionDeep vein PM Page 412 Cardiovascular Problems 413 with diabetes and smoking being the greatestrisk factors (AHA, 2005b). According to theAmerican Heart Association, only 25% of thoseolder adults with PAD get treatment. The most common symptoms of PAD are leg cramps that worsen when climbing stairs orwalking, but that dissipate with rest. The ma-jority of persons with PAD have no symptomsTable 11-14 General Approaches to Traditional Nursing of the Stroke Survivor When working with the patient, encourage use of the affected side to reduce neglect.When the person is alone, place items (such as the call light, tissues, and other personal items) on the unaffected side to promote self-care and safety and to avoid isolation. Use a variety of teaching modalities during educational sessions to promote learning.Minimize distractions during educational sessions. Keep these teaching items short and relevant.Use terms such as \"affected/unaffected\" side or \"weak/strong\" side instead of \"good/bad.\"Use critical pathways or care plans to promote consistency of care, but remember that each survivor is unique and be sure to adapt nursing care accordingly. Alternate rest and activity.Build endurance slowly. Remember that a stroke is exhausting to the entire body.Include the person and family in the plan of care.Assist the patient and family in setting reasonable goals.Make early referrals to stroke services or the specialized stroke team.Connect the family with a stroke support group or club.Use a discharge follow-up plan.Right Hemisphere Stroke Foster a calm and unhurried care environment.Break tasks into simple steps.Be especially attentive to safety issues that may arise from poor judgment and lack of safety awareness.Protect the patient from injury.Be alert for possible deficits that may not be overt.Avoid overstimulation. Left Hemisphere Stroke Speak slowly and distinctly.Use simple sentences for those with aphasia.Encourage all forms of communication.Use a variety of communication techniques: gesturing, cues, pointing, writing, communication boards, yes/no questions (if appropriate). Find what is most effective for each person. Allow time for the person to respond to questions.Provide teaching in a quiet, structured environment.Monitor the patient for swallowing difficulties.Promote a positive self-image by attention to good grooming, personal hygiene, and positive reinforcement.

PAD is a predictor of CHD andmakes a person more at risk for heart attack andstroke. Left untreated, PAD may eventually leadto impaired function and decreased quality oflife, even when no leg symptoms are present. Inthe most serious cases, PAD can lead to gan-grene and amputation of a lower extremity.Most cases of PAD can be managed withlifestyle modifications such as those discussedpreviously for heart-healthy living. Nursesshould also encourage patients with PAD to dis-cuss their symptoms with both their health careprovider and a physical therapist, as somepatients find symptom relief through a combi-nation of medical and therapy treatments. Respiratory Problems Pneumonia Pneumonia is a leading cause of death amongthe elderly. Many statistics related to the num-ber of cases of pneumonia are outdated, but in1996 there were about 4.8 million casesreported, and over 63,000 deaths in the UnitedStates attributed to pneumonia in 2000 (Amer-ican Lung Association, 2003). The majority ofthese cases occur in those age 65 and over, witholder adults having 5-10 times the risk of deathfrom pneumonia than younger adults (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank, 2000). Pneumonia is an inflammation or infection in the lungs that can be caused by a variety of fac-tors including bacteria, viruses, and aspiration.The elderly are considered at particularly highrisk for pneumonia, and even more so if they suf-fer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), CHF, or any immune-suppressing dis-eases such as AIDS. The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among those age 71-85 is50/1000 per year (Loeb, 2002).Diagnosis is made through chest x-ray, com- plete blood count, and/or sputum culture to de-termine the type and causal agents (if bacterial).A thorough history and physical should also beobtained. Crackles may be heard in the lungsthrough auscultation, and chest pain with short-ness of breath are common complaints. Cases of viral pneumonia account for about half of all types and tend to be less severe thanthe bacterial kind. Symptoms of viral pneu-monia include fever, nonproductive hackingcough, muscle pain, weakness, and shortnessof breath. The onset of bacterial pneumoniacan be sudden or gradual, but older adultsmay not present with the typical symptoms ofchills, chest pain, sweating, productive cough,or dyspnea. Confusion may be an additionalsign in the elderly. Bacterial pneumonia can often be treated suc- cessfully when detected early, and viral pneu-monia generally heals on its own (antibiotics arenot effective if pneumonia is caused by a virus),though older adults may experience a greaterrisk of complications than younger adults. Oralantibiotics will significantly help most patientswith bacterial pneumonia, and even thoughmany older persons may require hospitaliza-tions, intravenous (IV) antibiotics have not beenshown to be necessarily more effective than oraltypes, with IV treatment resulting in longerhospital stays (Loeb, 2002). Aspiration pneumonia is caused by inhalation of a foreign material such as fluids or food intothe lungs. This occurs more often in personswith impaired swallowing (see Chapter 12 fora discussion on dysphagia) and those who haveesophageal reflux disease or who are uncon-scious. One particular danger to which nursesshould be alert is those older adults receivingtube feedings. Care must be taken to avoid hav-ing the person in a laying position during and28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 414 Respiratory Problems 415 immediately after tube feeding because aspira-tion can occur. Having the head of the bed ele-vated or, even better, the person in a sittingposition when eating or receiving enteral nutri-tion helps to avoid the potential complication ofpneumonia related to aspiration. When recovering from pneumonia, the older adult should be encouraged to get plenty of restand take adequate fluids to help loosen secre-tions. Tylenol or aspirin (if not contraindicatedby other conditions) can be taken to managefever as well as aches and pains. Exposure to oth-ers with contagious respiratory conditionsshould be avoided. Respiratory complicationsare often what lead to death in the elderly, soolder adults should be cautioned to report anychanges in respiratory status such as increasedshortness of breath, high fever, or any othersymptoms that do not improve. Prevention of pneumonia is always best. Adults over the age of 65 are advised to get apneumonia vaccine, though its effectiveness maybe somewhat diminished in higher risk groupsthan in healthy younger adults (American LungAssociation, 2003). This vaccine is generallygiven one time, though sometimes a revaccina-tion is recommended after about 6 years for olderadults with higher risk. A yearly flu vaccine isalso recommended for older adults, because pneu-monia is a common complication of influenza inthis age group. Medicare will cover these vaccinesfor older persons, so cost should not be a pro-hibiting factor in prevention. Chronic Obstructive PulmonaryDisease (COPD) COPD refers to a group of diseases resulting from obstructed airflow. The most common ofthese diseases in older adults are emphysemaand chronic bronchitis, often occurring togetherwith the preferred label of COPD.COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for about 120,000deaths in 2002. It is estimated that nearly 24million U.S. adults have some type of impairedlung function. Slightly more females than malesare affected, with female smokers having a 13times greater chance of death from COPD thannonsmoking females (American Lung Associa-tion, 2004). The major risk factor for COPD is smoking, causing 80%-90% of COPD deaths. Otherrisk factors appear in Table 11-15 . Alpha-1- antitrypsin deficiency is a rare cause of COPD,but can be ruled out through blood tests.\"COPD is almost 100% preventable by avoid-ance of smoking\" (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher,& Plank, 2000, p. 201). Persons with COPD often experience a decrease in quality of life as the disease pro-gresses. Shortness of breath so characteristic ofthese diseases impairs the ability to work and dousual activities. According to a recent survey bythe American Lung Association, \"half of allCOPD patients (51%) say their condition lim-its their ability to work . . .\" and Page 415 416 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions hold chores (56%), social activities (53%),sleeping (50%) and family activities (46%)\"(2004, pg. 3).Chronic BronchitisChronic bronchitis is a common COPD among older adults. It results from recurrent inflamma-tion and mucus production in the bronchial tubes.Repeated infections produce blockage from mu-cus and eventual scarring that restricts airflow.The American Lung Association (2004) statedthat about 9.1 million Americans had been diag-nosed with chronic bronchitis as of 2002. Femalesare twice as likely as males to have this problem. The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchi- tis include increased mucus production, short-ness of breath, wheezing, decreased breath sounds,and chronic productive cough. Chronic bron-chitis can lead to emphysema.EmphysemaEmphysema results when the alveoli in the lungs are irreversibly destroyed. As the lungslose elasticity, air becomes trapped in the alveo-lar sacs, resulting in carbon dioxide retention andimpaired gas exchange. More males than femalesare affected with emphysema, and most (91%) ofthe 3.1 million Americans with this disease areover the age of 45 (American Lung Association,2004). Signs and symptoms of emphysema in-clude shortness of breath, decreased exercise tol-erance, and cough. Diagnosis is made throughpulmonary function and other tests, and a thor-ough history and physical.Treatment for COPDsAlthough there are no easy cures for COPD,there are several measures that older adults cantake to improve their quality of life by control-ling symptoms and minimizing complications.These include lifestyle modifications, medica-tions, respiratory therapy, and pulmonary reha-bilitation (see Table 11-16 ). Oxygen therapy is usually required as the disease progresses. Medications are used to help control symp- toms, but they do not change the downward tra-jectory of COPD that occurs over time as lungfunction worsens. Typical medications givenregularly include bronchodilators through oralor inhaled routes. Antibiotics may be given tofight infections and systemic steroids for acuteexacerbations. In extreme cases, lung transplantation or lung volume reduction surgery may be indi-cated. Older persons with severely impairedlung function related to emphysema may be athigher risk of death from these procedures andhave poorer outcomes. Nurses working with older adults with COPD will find it challenging to assist them with a homemaintenance program that addresses their uniqueneeds with this chronic disease. Teaching shouldinvolve the patient and family and should plan forthe long term. Reducing factors that contributeto symptoms, use of medications, alternating restand activity, energy conservation, stress manage-ment, relaxation, and the role of supplementaloxygen should all be addressed. Many older adultswith COPD find it helpful to join a support groupwith those who are living with similar problems. Tuberculosis (TB) TB, or mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an infec- tion that can attack any part of the body, butparticularly targets the lungs. TB is spreadthrough the air by coughing, sneezing, laugh-ing, or other activities in which particles maybecome airborne. According to the American Lung Association, the number of new cases of TB in the United28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 416 Respiratory Problems 417 States has steadily decreased over the past 10years. In 2003, there were 14,874 new cases inthe United States. TB is seen more often in (indescending order) Asian Americans, PacificIslanders, African Americans, American Indians,and Hispanics than whites. The rate of TB casesamong those from other countries is eight timesgreater than for those born in the United States(American Lung Association, 2005). The AIDSepidemic has contributed to the spread of TB,particularly in less developed countries, due tothe suppression of the immune system associatedwith those who are infected with HIV . Nursinghome residents are considered an at-risk groupdue to the typically higher rates found in thispopulation. General guidelines from theAdvisory Committee for Elimination of Tubercu-losis (CDC, 1990) set concrete guidelines for pre-vention and management of TB in nursinghomes to decrease the spread among this institu-tionalized and vulnerable population. Thus, olderadults who may be discharged from acute carefacilities to a nursing home will generally under-go TB skin testing prior to discharge. Screening for TB is simple and can be done at the local health department, clinic, or doctor'soffice. A Mantoux test is an intradermal injec-tion that is read for results in 48-72 hours afteradministration. A result of 11 mm or greater ofinduration (not redness, but swelling) is con-sidered a positive result. It is recommended thatolder adults undergo a two-step screening whereinthe test is given again, because there are manyfalse results in the elderly. A positive TB skintest should be followed up with a chest x-ray torule out active disease. It must be noted that persons who received a vaccine for TB may have a positive reaction. ATB vaccine is commonly given in many coun-tries outside the United States.Table 11-16 Strategies for Symptom Management for Older Adults with COPD Do not smoke.Avoid second-hand smoke.Avoid air pollutants and other lung irritants.Exercise regularly as tolerated or prescribed.Maintain proper nutrition.Maintain adequate hydration\u2014especially water intake.Take medications as ordered: bronchodilators (antibiotics and steroids for exacerbations).Use energy conservation techniques.Alternate activities and rest.Learn and regularly use breathing exercises.Learn stress management and relaxation techniques.Recognize the role of supplemental oxygen.Receive yearly pneumonia and influenza vaccines to avoid serious infections.Investigate pulmonary rehabilitation programs.Join a support group for those with breathing problems and their families. Explore any possible surgical options with the physician.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 417 418 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions hospital with active TB. In 1998, the FDA ap-proved a new medication, rifapentine (Priftin),to be used with other drugs for TB. Medicationsshould be strictly taken for the entire period oftime (many months) to kill all of the bacteria.Older adults may need assistance with keepingtrack of these medications. The use of a medica-tion box set up by another competent and in-formed family member to assure compliancewith the medication regimen may be helpful,because it can be overwhelming for some per-sons. Adequate rest, nutrition, and hydration aswell as breathing exercises may help with com-bating the effects of TB. Gastrointestinal Disorders Gastrointestinal problems are among the mostfrequent complaints in older adults. Several ofthe more common disorders will be discussedhere, including gastroesophageal Gastroesophageal RefluxDisease (GERD) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is thought to occur in 5%-7% of the general pop-ulation, affecting men, women, and children. Itresults when acid or other stomach contentsback up into the esophagus. Many children out-grow this problem by the age of about 1 year,but for older adults, GERD can be a chronic dis-order that affects quality of life. GERD may be related to several factors in- cluding decreased lower esophageal sphincter(LES) tone and increased pressure in the stom-ach or abdomen. Decreased peristalsis and de-A person can be infected with TB and have no symptoms. This means they may have a pos-itive skin test, but cannot spread the disease.Such a person can develop TB later if leftuntreated. Those with active TB can spread thedisease to others and should be treated by aphysician. The signs and symptoms of TBappear in Table 11-17 . For older adults born in the United States, a positive skin test may prompt the physician toinitiate preventative treatment. The medicationisoniazid (INH) is generally given to kill the TBbacteria. Treatment with INH often lasts atleast 6 months. Few adults have side effects fromthe medication, but these include nausea, vom-iting, jaundice, fever, abdominal pain, anddecreased appetite. Patients taking INH shouldbe cautioned not to drink alcohol while on themedication. Patients with active TB can be cured, but the medication regimen is complex, with several dif-ferent drugs taken in combination. Cautionshould be taken to avoid spread of the disease.This generally means isolation for patients in the Table 11-17 Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis (TB) A severe cough that lasts more than 2 weeksChest painBloody sputumWeaknessFatigueWeight loss*Chills*Fever *Night 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 418 Gastrointestinal Disorders 419 layed emptying of the stomach may also play arole. GERD causes esophageal irritation andmany of the common symptoms associated withthis disorder. Factors related to GERD include pregnancy, obesity, and activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as wearing tight cloth-ing, bending over, or heavy lifting (MedlinePlus,2005). The most common symptom of GERD is heartburn. In patients with GERD this mayoccur daily to weekly. Chest pain, difficultyswallowing, a hoarse voice, coughing, and res-piratory problems such as asthma or wheezingmay also result (Edwards, 2002). It is importantfor older adults to have proper diagnosis andtreatment, because continued reflux can resultin esophagitis, and over time abnormal cellsmay develop (Barrett's esophagus) that canincrease the risk for cancer of the esophagus. Diagnosis is made through a history and physical. Many cases of GERD can be treatedwith lifestyle modifications and medication.Persistent symptoms of GERD should be re-ferred to an internist or gastroenterologist. Thisis particularly true of older adults, who maynot present with typical symptoms, or presentwith vague symptoms that might be attributedto other causes. The physician may wish to doa series of tests, one of the most reliable beingexamining the esophagus and stomach througha fiberoptic scope while the person is underconscious sedation. This allows the doctor tovisualize the entire area, view damage, and takebiopsies if needed. A common cause of GERDis Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) , and this can be diagnosed through biopsy. GERD can betreated with a combination of medications thatincludes antibiotics and drugs to inhibit gas-tric secretions.Treatment involves lifestyle modifications aimed at decreasing causal factors. Patientsshould be instructed to avoid offending foodssuch as caffeine, chocolate, nicotine, alcohol, andpeppermint. These substances decrease the LEStone and allow the sphincter to become floppy,letting acid creep up into the esophagus. Certainmedications may have the same affect, particu-larly anticholinergics, some hormones, calciumchannel blockers, and theophylline. The olderperson's medication list should be carefullyreviewed and offending medications modified.Additional lifestyle modifications include avoid-ing spicy and tomato-based foods, acidic prod-ucts, carbonated beverages, and stress that cantrigger increased acid production. Patients shouldbe instructed to avoid eating or drinking 3-4hours prior to bedtime and to elevate the entirehead of the bed on 6-8 inch blocks. Some per-sons feel better sleeping in a recliner chair withthe head elevated during flare-ups of heartburn Box 11-3 Resources for Those with GERD American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 4900-B South 31st StreetArlington, VA 301-654-2055www.gastro.org28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 419 420 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions symptoms. Additionally, more frequent butsmaller meals will help minimize the pressurein the stomach and should decrease reflux. Medications play an important role in the treatment of GERD. Antacids are usually usedin conjunction with histamine 2 as Tagamet, Zantac, Pepcid AC, and Axid for mild GERD. If those are ineffective incontrolling symptoms, the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are thought to be drugs of choice. These include the popularly advertisedmedications Nexium, Prevacid, and Protonix. GERD is a potentially serious condition. Older persons displaying symptoms should be thor-oughly evaluated and aggressively treated. Thekey nursing interventions center around teachinglifestyle modifications and proper use of medica-tions. Most medications used in GERD can haveantacids taken with them between meals andbefore bed to help control heartburn symptoms.Most of the medications for this disorder are alsotaken in the morning prior to breakfast (on anempty stomach). H2 blockers are sometimesordered twice per day. PPIs, usually taken once perday but sometimes in a divided dose (morningand evening), should be taken on an empty stom-ach. With most such medications, the person thenmust remember to eat one hour after taking themedication in order for it to be most effective.Remember that management of GERD poses sig-nificant challenges to the health care team in orderto prevent associated complications. Peptic Ulcer About 25 million Americans have peptic ulcerdisease, especially those age 55-65 (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank, 2000). The inci-dence increases with age and occurs more oftenin Hispanics and African Americans thanCaucasians. As with many such problems, earlysymptoms may not be seen in the elderly. Anincrease in stress, such as occurs with COPDs,can trigger an ulcer as a complication, so manyolder adults with chronic respiratory problemsare prescribed prophylactic medications the increased useof contributed to a higherincidence of peptic ulcer in the general popula-tion. These medications contribute to ulcerdevelopment by causing a decrease in the lack ofprotection to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Risk factors for peptic ulcer disease include smoking, drinking alcohol, caffeine, stress, andhelicobacter pylori (H. pylori ) infection. Signs and symptoms of include continued epi-gastric pain, particularly after meals; bowelchanges; bloating; and eventually anorexia. Inolder adults, it is essential to distinguish be-tween ulcer pain and cardiac pain, because bothmay present as \"indigestion.\" Diagnosis of peptic ulcer is made through a history and physical. The physician must firstdetermine the type of ulcer. Edwards stated that\"90-100% of individuals with duodenal ulcersare infected with H. pylori and this is as accurate as any diagnostic test.\" Barium contrast testingis an initial diagnostic tool, followed by endo-scope and biopsy if needed, keeping in mindthat less invasive and more inexpensive methodsof diagnosis should be tried first. Treatment of ulcers involves antacids and other medication to control acid production,diet, avoidance of risk factors, and combinationtherapy if H. pylori is the cause. Nurses will need to engage in patient education for treatment tohave the best outcome. The medication regimento treat H. pylori is challenging for older pa- tients, yet will eradicate the problem in manycases. Nurses should emphasize that H. pylori is28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 420 Gastrointestinal Disorders 421 considered a toxin to the body, because it canpredispose a person to cancer (Edwards, 2002).Stress management may be helpful to some peo-ple, and dietary issues such as avoidance of caf-feine, alcohol, and milk products while the ulceris healing is recommended. Patients who smokeshould stop, because this is an associated riskfactor. Serious complications such as bleedingcan result if patients neglect treatment. Diverticulitis Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of the pouches of the intestinal mucosa. Sixty-five percent of older adults will develop diver-ticulosis (\"pouches of the intestinal mucosa inthe weakened muscle wall of the large bowel\"[Eliopoulos, 2005, p. 332]) ( Figure 11-7 ) by age 85, with some going on to develop diver-ticulitis (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank,2000). Most persons developing diverticulitisare elderly men. Risk factors for diverticulitis include obesity, chronic constipation, and hiatal hernia. A dietlow in fiber is also thought to contribute to thisproblem. Older persons may not present withthe typical symptoms of pain in left lower quad-rant, nausea, and fever. During bouts of this dis-order, the person may experience constipation,diarrhea, and mucous and/or blood in the stools.Certain foods may irritate the condition, espe-cially those with seeds such as berries or pick-les that are not easily digested. Diagnosis is made through barium enema. Nurses should be sure that after this exam isdone, the patient is taught to take the pre-scribed medications to empty the bowel so thatthe barium does not harden inside and causeconstipation and other difficulties. Treatment is generally with antibiotics, and if hospitalization is necessary, intravenous fluidswill be given. The person should be taught toavoid irritating foods. In extreme cases diverti-culitis may result in bowel obstruction leadingto a colostomy. In certain circumstances of ad-vanced disease, patients may elect to undergoremoval of the diseased bowel to prevent emer-gency surgery for bowel obstruction. Cancers According to Edwards (2002), GI cancersaccount for greater then 25% of all cancerdeaths in older adults, making them the num-ber two cause of cancer next to lung disease. EsophagusThe two most common type of cancers of theesophagus are squamous cell carcinoma and ade-nocarcinoma. Of the squamous cell type, blackmales with a history of alcoholism and heavysmoking comprise the group with highest riskand incidence. Adenocarcinoma is being seenmore often in white males, particularly result-ing from Barrett's epithelium (a complication ofGERD, as discussed earlier) (Edwards, 2002). Early detection of esophageal cancer is key, because prognosis of either type is rather poor.Esophagoscopy is a major diagnostic test. Ma-jor symptoms of esophageal cancer includeweight loss and trouble swallowing. In olderadults, symptoms may not appear until thecancer is advanced and perhaps already metas-tasized. It responds poorly to radiation andmay be inoperable. Nurses should instructolder persons with these symptoms to bechecked by a physician. Nurses can help withprimary prevention of this type of cancer bybeing proactive in smoking cessation groupsand by encouraging limitation of alcoholintake (a maximum of one drink per day forfemales, and two for males).28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 421 422 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions Figure 11-7 Diverticula.

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 422 Gastrointestinal Disorders 423 StomachStomach is most often seen in older menage 65-74 (Eliopoulous, 2005). There is a greaterincidence among Hispanics, African Americans,and Asians/Pacific Islanders than whites. Ratesare high among Japanese men living in Japan(American Cancer Society, 2005d). Men havetwice the risk of women. When detected early, there is a good progno- sis, but once a tumor has advanced, patients maydeteriorate quickly. Early signs may not be pres-ent in older persons, but may include epigastricpain, anorexia, nausea, and difficulty with swal-lowing. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapyare options for treatment (and often used incombination), but not all of these methods areequally successful with each type of tumor. H. pylori infection can be a contributing factor to stomach tumors, and treatment of the bacte-rial infection may be more effective in cancertreatment than with other unknown causes. Nurses can help with primary prevention of stomach cancer by educating older adults as torisk factor reduction and early recognition ofsymptoms. Dietary changes are a significant wayto reduce risk. A diet lower in red meats (riskdoubles if eating red meat more than 13 timesper week) and higher in antioxidants has a pro-tective effect (American Cancer Society, 2005d).Additionally, regular physical exams and report-ing suspicious symptoms for early testing canhelp increase chances of survival. Men, particu-larly those of the at-risk ethnic groups, should beespecially alerted to these factors.ColorectalColorectal cancer is one of the most common yettreatable forms of cancer. The vast majority ofthis type of cancer is adenocarcinomas arisingfrom polyps. Although most polyps do notbecome malignant, the risk of cancer increasesas polyp size increases (Edwards, 2002). Thus,routine screening for this type of cancer is rec-ommended in middle age and certainly in thosewith a family history (see Chapter 10 for screen-ing guidelines). Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women.Hispanics and African Americans are at higherrisk than whites. About 145,290 persons will bediagnosed in 2005, with 56,290 deaths resultingfrom this type of cancer (Cancer Research andPrevention Foundation, 2005). The 5-year sur-vival rate when detected in early stages is greaterthan 90% (American Cancer Society, 2005a). Risk factors for colorectal cancer include upper socioeconomic groups, high fat intake, alcohol con-sumption, cigarette smoking, sedentary lifestyle,and exposure to environmental toxins. Symptomsdepend on location of the lesion, but may includerectal bleeding, anemia, fatigue, abdominalcramping, and change in bowel patterns. Diag-nosis is made through history and physical as wellas diagnostic tests such as hemoccult, bariumenema, and endoscopic exams. The flexible sig-moidoscopy is currently thought to be the best testfor detecting early problems. Surgery is the bestoption for treatment of early malignant polyps. Colorectal cancers are largely preventable, so nurses need to focus interventions on educatingthe public about this problem. Nurses shouldteach their patients and clients that adding fruits,vegetables, and fiber to the diet may help protectagainst this type of cancer. Increasing activity lev-els while avoiding smoking, obesity, high-fatfoods, high-sucrose foods, and excess alcohol areall ways to reduce risk (Cancer Research and Pre-vention Foundation, 2005; Edwards, 2002). 28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 423 424 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions where from three times per day to three timesper week, so patterns vary widely among indi-viduals. In most hospital settings, constipationis considered to be present in a patient whenthere has been no bowel movement for morethan 2 days. The results of normal aging contribute to this disorder through the slowing of intestinalperistalsis and the decrease in thirst mechanismresulting in less fluid intake. Others causesinclude dehydration, decreased activity, lack offiber in the diet, side effects of medications, andneurogenic bowel or other disease. Constipationcan lead to fecal impaction and even bowelobstruction in the most severe cases. Generally, constipation is a manageable problem that is often best remedied by care-fully planned nursing interventions. The inter-ventions depend on the cause. There are severalfactors to be considered (see Table 11-18 ). Factors that cannot be controlled related tobowel function include a family history of dis-ease or presence of neurogenic bowel or otherdisorder. However, there are many factors that Table 11-18 Factors to Consider in Bowel Management Uncontrollable Controllable Factors FactorsFamily history DietPresence of neurogenic Fiber bowel Fluids Existence of prior Timing bowel disease Activity Positioning MedicationsPancreasPancreatic cancer is found more often in olderadults and is a leading cause of death for this agegroup. It generally strikes those between 60 and80 years of age and is more prevalent in menthan women (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, &Plank, 2000). Cigarette smoking, family his-tory, and diabetes are significant risk factors. Infact, the American Cancer Society estimates that3 in 10 cases of pancreatic cancer are attributedto smoking (2005c). Cancer of the pancreas generally progresses rapidly and carries a poor prognosis. Early detec-tion is not always possible due to lack of symp-toms. Early symptoms may include nausea,vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, depression, andexcessive belching. Jaundice and itching occurwith progression of the cancer (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank, 2000). Treatment is usually palliative, particularly for advanced cancer in the older adult. Surgeryis an option in some types/locations of tumors,but given the poor prognosis in the elderly,interventions will focus on comfort measuressuch as pain control. Narcotic analgesics andantihistamines for itching are standard treat-ment. Hospice services should be obtained asearly as possible when the prognosis is terminal. Constipation Constipation is the most common bowel prob-lem in older adults. Bowel function is not atopic generally discussed in most societies.Because of the private nature of eliminationactivities, older adults may experience difficul-ties in bowel function and not let the problembe known until it is serious enough to interferewith normal daily functioning. Normal bowelfunction is considered a bowel movement any-28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 424 Gastrointestinal Disorders 425 can be modified to assist with prevention ofconstipation and maintenance of an effectivebowel program. These include diet, fiber, flu-ids, timing, activity, positioning, and medica-tions (Mauk, 2005). The method of treatment and subsequent pre- vention of constipation depends on the cause.General principles ( Table 11-19 ) are to use all natural means first and start with a clean bowel.That is, if impaction is present, manually removethe stool if possible and administer prescribedmedications to cleanse the bowel prior to begin-ning any bowel program. Bowel managementfocuses on modification of the controllable fac-tors. First, the person should be encouraged toconsume a diet high in fiber. This includes foodssuch as whole grains, bran cereal, beans, pulpyfruits, and root vegetables. Although popcornand nuts are high in fiber, they pose a problemfor older adults with dysphagia or diverticulitis,so care should be taken when recommending cer-tain foods. Patients should drink plenty of flu-ids, and water is the best choice. Generally,between 1,500 and 2,000 cc's (or 1 1/2-2 liters) per day is a good intake for older adults. Timing is another important factor in treat- ment. Persons should take advantage of theirusual bowel patterns; that is, if they usuallydefecate first thing in the morning, then thattime should be tried first. If this fails, the per-son should attempt to move the bowels shortlyafter breakfast, because this is when the gastro-colic reflex is strongest. Positioning sitting up,not on the bedpan or in bed, is best to allowgravity to assist and to promote a feeling of nor-malcy. Even those who cannot ambulate to thetoilet can use a bedside commode. Increasingactivity will help to stimulate peristalsis anddecrease constipation. All of these methods areemployed in a bowel maintenance program. Lastly, medications may play a role for those patients with constipation that is due to disease ordisorders such as stroke, brain injury, or spinalcord injury. Oral medications fall into manycategories a few. Oral medications such as Colaceare the most common. Nurses must instructpatients to drink at least 1,000 cc (1 liter) ofwater per day for Colace to be effective. Ironically,Table 11-19 Principles of Bowel Programs to Prevent Constipation Start with a clean bowel (administer needed medications or enemas to cleanse the bowelprior to initiating a program or protocol). Try all natural means first: fiber, fluids, activity, timing, positioning. Be sure the person is taking adequate fiber and fluids before adding medications. Change only one item at a time in the program. Allow several days to pass beforeevaluating the effectiveness of the change. Ifneeded, add another intervention. Stool softeners are given for hardened stool and the person must drink at least a liter offluid per day for them to be effective. Peristaltic stimulators are useful when the person is unable to move the stool down intothe rectum. Use the least caustic type of suppository that is effective for the older person. Avoid the use of bedpans\u2014have the person sit upright on the toilet or commode. Avoid the regular use of enemas.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 425 426 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions for some persons, increasing fluids to this levelmay preclude the need for medication to treatconstipation. Rectal medications include several types of suppositories: glycerin (work by releasing gas and distendingthe combinations such as theTherevac mini-enema (melted glycerin, Colace,and soap in a plastic dispenser). The Therevacmini-enema may produce results more quicklybecause the medication is already liquefied andmore readily absorbed. One drawback ofTherevac is that the tip of the plastic dispenserthat is inserted into the rectum can cause smalltears without adequate care and lubricant. Important to remember in administering suppositories is that the typical suppositoryworks by acting as an irritant to the rectalmucosa, so it must be placed next to the rectalwall in order to work. Placing suppositories intoimpacted stool will be ineffective. The personshould be laid on the left side for suppositoryinsertion to position the bowel in the most cor-rect way for effectiveness. Products such as theThereva mini-enema are quite effective in olderadults and take less time for results. Waxy sup-positories may take 15-60 minutes to melt andproduce results. Digital stimulation is used in some instances, particularly in those with spinal cord injury, incombination with suppository therapy as a dailybowel program. However, as a rule, digital stim-ulation should be avoided in the elderly due tothe potential for vaso-vagal stimulation that cancause heart and blood pressure changes. Othermethods, as discussed above, are generally moreeffective and safer in older adults, except forthose with certain types of spinal injury.Enemas should also be avoided as part of a routine bowel program. Enema use should berestricted to cleansing of the bowel for presur-gical preparation or for impaction. In olderadults, making enemas part of the regular bowelprogram may result in a distended, lazy boweland dependence on enemas for evacuation.Likewise, over-the-counter laxatives should beused only when needed, and older personsshould be educated on their appropriate use. Finally, special bowel programs may be needed for those with neurogenic bowel function.Patients with problems in the brain and/or spinalcord, such as those with stroke, dementia, Park-inson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, traumaticbrain injury, or spinal cord injury, will need theexpertise of rehabilitation nurses to develop acomprehensive and realistic plan for bowel man-agement and the prevention of constipation. Genitourinary Problems The elderly can have several major problemsrelated to reproductive and urinary systems.Reznicek stated that \"the three most commonand vexing clinical urologic problems in theelderly are prostate cancer and benign outletobstruction in men and urinary incontinence inwomen\" (2000, p. 1). This section will discussthese common problems including urinaryincontinence, bladder cancer, vaginitis, breastand cervical cancer, benign cancer, and erectile dysfunction. Urinary Incontinence Incontinence of the bladder (loss of urine) is a common problem among older adults, affecting30% of community-dwelling elderly, over halfof those living in nursing homes, and at least11% of elders in acute care hospitals (Bradway28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 426 Genitourinary Problems 427 & Yetman, 2002; Eliopoulos, 2005). It is asymptom rather than a disease in itself. Womenare particularly affected by urinary incontinence,and because many find it embarrassing to dis-cuss, the problem often goes untreated. Olderwomen may not even consider themselvesincontinent unless they have an \"accident\" inpublic. If they are able to hide or manage theproblem themselves with the use of peri pads orother undergarments, they may not seek help.Incontinence should never be considered a nor-mal part of aging, because it is highly treatablein most cases and is not an inevitable part of oldage. This chapter presents an introduction to theproblem of urinary incontinence. Please refer toChapter 12 for a more in-depth discussion. Understanding bladder anatomy and physi- ology may help with understanding inconti-nence. The bladder is made of many layers ofsmooth muscle that create a holding space forurine. The kidneys filter waste from the bodyand send the remaining fluid through theureters into the bladder. The bladder has stretchreceptors that signal the brain when it is full andneeds to be emptied. In a person without neu-rological deficits, inhibitory fibers allow theperson to hold the urine until he or she reachesa bathroom. When it is time to void, the detru- sor or bladder muscle contracts and the sphinc- ters relax, allowing the urine to flow out. Inpersons with neurological problems such asspinal cord injury, head injury, or advancedAlzheimer's, messages to inhibit expulsion ofurine may not get back to the brain, resultingin incontinence or urinary retention.AssessmentAssessment of incontinence involves a thoroughhistory and physical. Ask about frequency ofvoiding, pain, feelings of emptying completely,and color and odor of urine. A urine culture andsensitivity should be ordered to rule out infec-tion. A journal may be kept by the person torecord incidents of incontinence, oral fluidintake, precipitating activities, and other infor-mation that would be helpful to a health careprofessional in determining the cause or type ofincontinence.Managing Incontinence in the ElderlyPrior to managing incontinence, the cause ortype should be determined based on signs,symptoms, history and physical, and lab results.Be sure to check for the presence of a urinarytract infection (UTI), because this is sometimesa causal factor in older adults ( Case Study 11-3 ). For most types of incontinence, timed, sched-uled, or prompted voiding helps to decreaseincontinent episodes, as do Kegel exercises that help strengthen pelvic floor muscles.Patients should also be taught to balance intakeand output and may need to limit fluids atnight if nocturia is a factor.Types of IncontinenceThere are several common types of incontinence.These include stress, urge, overflow, reflex, functional, and mixed . Determining the type of incontinence will point the way to appropri-ate management. Stress Incontinence. Stress incontinence gen- erally results from multiple pregnancies, obesity,or surgery. It is triggered by laughing, sneezing,coughing, or straining of abdominal muscles tothe point that the intra-abdominal pressure isgreater than the ability of the sphincters to resist.Small amounts of urine are lost in occasional orfrequent episodes. Treatment includes Kegelexercises with or without biofeedback. The ben-efit of biofeedback is that the patient can see28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 427 428 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions 2. What treatments would be expected at this type of clinic? 3. Are there resources where a stu- dent nurse could find out moreinformation about incontinenceand its treatment? 4. Do you think that such a nurse- managed clinic could show goodclient outcomes for a problemsuch as this?The clinical nurse specialist is run- ning a clinic for women with inconti-nence. She specializes in helping olderwomen with stress incontinence regainbladder control and decrease the inci-dence of wetting episodes. A studentnurse is doing a clinical rotation in theclinic and has many questions. Questions: 1. What should the nurse in charge teach the student nurseabout the types of incontinence? Case Study 11-3 through electronic means the effect of contract-ing the appropriate muscles. Some older adultsmay find biofeedback distasteful and can learnthe same principles through proper instructionfrom the nurse. Urge Incontinence. This type of inconti- nence is related to birth defects, spine or nervedamage, immobility, prostate problems, overac-tive bladder, or cancer. Some older persons expe-rience this type as a result of advancing age,though it should not be considered a normalpart of aging. The person experiences a suddenand unexpected need to void with moderate tolarge amounts of urine lost. Kegel exercises maybe quite effective for this type of incontinence.To be most effective, the person should firstmaster the ability to tighten the muscles usedin Kegel exercises. Then, when the urge to voidhits, the person should implement the Kegelmaneuver while en route to the bathroom facil-ities. Urge incontinence may also be helped bycombining the pelvic floor strengthening exer-cises with timed voiding, lengthening theamount of time between voidings until morenormal voiding patterns are achieved. Recentresearch has shown that most incontinenceamong the elderly is from \"overactive bladder\"(OAB). If this is true, then in many instancesbladder retraining and medications should makea significant difference. Overflow Incontinence. This type of incon- tinence is seen mainly in those with birthdefects, spinal cord injury or nerve damage,multiple sclerosis, or loss of bladder muscletone; postsurgery; or as a side effect of medica-tions. It results from small to moderate amountsof urine spilling over from a full bladder andusually does not result in complete emptying.Persons with this type of bladder problem mayhave frequent urinary tract infections from urine28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 428 Genitourinary Problems 429 sitting in the bladder in amounts where bacte-ria can grow. They are generally unable, becauseof a congenital defect or neurogenic problem, toempty urine voluntarily. Treatment for overflow incontinence is to treat the cause when possible. For example, ifincontinence is the result of a side effect of med-ication, that medication may be discontinued orchanged. However, because it is often not pos-sible to change the cause, as in the case of a pre-existing disease, treatment may take severalforms. The bladder may be scanned to checkpostvoid residual urine. If a bladder scanmachine is unavailable, the physician may ordera PVR (postvoid residual) catheterization. Thisis done by performing a straight catheterization,and tells how much urine is left in the bladderafter the person voids. When overflow inconti-nence is present, these amounts are generallysignificant. A general rule is that no more than100-150 cc should remain in the bladder aftervoiding, or the person is not completely empty-ing. Intermittent catheterization is the besttreatment for emptying this type of bladder.Persons will generally not be able to voluntarilyvoid, and the bladder must be emptied by somemeans on a regular basis. Intermittent catheter-ization is the preferred means, because it resultsin less infection than indwelling foley catheters.In the event that the older person is unable tomanage intermittent catheterization and has nocaregiver to assist, an indwelling foley catheter,or suprapubic catheter, may be necessary. Reflex Incontinence. Generally related to spinal cord injury, developmental disability, con-genital defect, dementia, or other brain injury,reflex incontinence gives no warning prior to theincontinent episode. Often, a large amount ofurine is lost and emptying may be complete.Treatment for this type of problem is similar tooverflow incontinence in that the person usuallycannot stop and start urine flow on his or herown. Intermittent catheterization is usually nec-essary to avoid incontinence. Timed or scheduledvoiding may help, but if the person is unable tostart the flow of urine, this may be ineffective.Similar to overflow incontinence, an indwellingfoley catheter may be needed if episodes are con-tinual and timed voiding is ineffective. Functional Incontinence. This type of in- continence is related to the inability to get tobathroom facilities due to functional reasonssuch as obesity, clutter that blocks the path tofacilities, or immobility. When associated withurge incontinence, as is often the case, it iscalled mixed incontinence. Treatment involvesmodifying the environment or modifying thelifestyle. Clutter should be removed, and a com-mode may need to be placed nearer to the bedsideat night to avoid nocturia incontinence at night. Bladder Cancer According to the National Cancer Institute(NCI), 38,000 men and 15,000 women arediagnosed with bladder cancer each year in theUnited States. \"It is the fourth most commontype of cancer in men and the eighth most com-mon in women\" (NCI, 2005). The incidenceincreases with age, with an average age at diag-nosis of 68 or 69 (MayoClinic, 2004). Men arethree times as likely to get cancer of the bladderas women (American Foundation for UrologicDisease, 2005). Risk factors include chronicbladder irritation and cigarette smoking, thelatter contributing to over half of cases ( Case Study 11-4 ). The classic symptom of bladder cancer is painless hematuria, which may be a reason thatolder adults sometimes do not seek treatmentright away. They may attribute the bleeding to28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 429 430 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions invasive, if ever. Certainly chemotherapy, radi-ation, and immune (biological) therapy are othertreatment options, depending on the extent ofthe cancer. Biological therapy includes BacillusCalmette-Guerin (BCG) wash, an immunestimulant that triggers the body to inhibittumor growth. Treatments are administereddirectly into the bladder through a catheter for2 hours once per week for 6 or more weeks(MayoClinic, 2004). However, in 90% of thecases, surgery is involved as a standard treat-ment (American Cancer Society, 2004). If the cancer begins to invade the bladder muscle, then removal of the bladder ( cystec- tomy ) is indicated to prevent metastasis. Additional diagnostic tests will be performed ifthis is suspected, including CT scan or MRI.Chemotherapy and/or radiation may be used incombination with surgery. When the cancerousbladder is removed, the person will have aurostomy , a stoma from which urine drains into a collection bag on the outside of the body,much like a colostomy does. Nursing careincludes assessment and care of the stoma, emp-tying and changing collection bags as needed,and significant education of the patient relatedto intake/output, ostomy care, appliances, andthe like. Female Reproductive System Several problems common among older femaleswill be discussed here. These include vaginitis,and cervical and breast cancer. V aginitisNormal aging changes in the female reproductivesystem (see Chapter 6) make elderly women moreat risk for infection. The vaginal canal becomesmore fragile with age due to atrophy. Less vagi-nal lubrication and more alkaline pH due tohemorrhoids or other causes and feel thatbecause there is no pain, it could not be serious.Diagnosis may involve several tests including anintravenous pyelogram (IVP), urinalysis, andcystoscopy (in which the physician visualizes thebladder structures through a flexible fiberopticscope). Once diagnosed, treatment depends on the invasiveness of the cancer. A transurethral resec-tion (TUR) may involve burning superficiallesions through a scope. Bladder cancer may beslow to spread, and less invasive treatments maycontinue for years before the cancer becomesBox 11-4 Resources for Those with Common Cancers American Cancer Society (Breast Cancer)I Can Cope (community support groups) www.cancer.org1-800-ACS-2345 National Breast Cancer Foundation www.nationalbreastcancer.org American Cancer Society (Bladder Cancer)1599 Clifton Road, N.E.Atlanta, GA 30329 800-ACS-2345www.cancer.org Bladder Health Councilc/o American Foundation for Urologic Disease 1000 Corporate Boulevard, Suite 410Linthicum, MD 21090 Urological AssociationOnline Page 430 Genitourinary Problems 431 lower estrogen levels put elderly women atincreased risk of vaginitis. Symptoms of vagini-tis may be similar to UTI or yeast infection, andmay include itching and foul-smelling discharge. Vaginitis is treated with topical estrogen creams or estrogen replacement therapy. Womenshould be instructed to avoid douching and fem-inine deodorant sprays or perfumes. Wearingcotton undergarments may also help. A water-soluble lubricant such as K-Y gel should be usedduring intercourse if vaginal dryness is a prob-lem, because the use of other lubricants such asVaseline contributes to cases of vaginitis.Cervical CancerCervical cancer incidence peaks in women age50 to 60, with women over age 65 accountingfor a significant number of new cases and deathseach year. Healthy People 2000 initiatives havehelped to raise awareness among health careproviders and the general public about the needfor screening for cervical cancer. However, evenwith heightened awareness, studies indicate thatolder patients are generally treated less aggres-sively (radiation versus surgery) and have pooreroutcomes than younger patients, with someolder women refusing treatment altogether(Rissner & Murphy, 2005). Additionally, late-stage cancer diagnoses and subsequent death aremore common among women over 65 thanamong those in younger age groups (Bradley,Given, & Roberts, 2004). The current American Cancer Society guide- lines state that women should have annual PapQuestions: 1. What risk factors did Dr. Johnson have for bladder cancer? 2.

If Dr. Johnson's cancer becomes invasive, what other options areavailable for treatment? 5. Describe the nursing implica- tions and care if Dr. Johnsonneeded to have a cystectomy? 6. How would you explain this procedure to his family?Dr. Johnson is a 62-year-old dentist who runs a busy practice in a large sub-urb of Chicago. He had been a smokerfor over 30 years but recently quit. Forsome time he has noted little spots ofblood in his urine, but he did not havepain, so he attributed it to someprostate problems he has had in thepast. Dr. Johnson hears a couple of hispatients discussing a mutual friend withbladder cancer who has similar symp-toms, and this prompts him to visit hisfamily physician for a checkup. Afterseveral tests and a cystoscopy, Dr.Johnson is diagnosed with cancer.Case 4:21 PM Page 431 432 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions smears until age 30. After age 30, with no his-tory of abnormal smears, women may elect tohave the screening done every 2-3 years. Thoseage 70 and older may choose to stop screeningentirely if they have had no abnormal results inthe past three smears and no abnormal resultswithin 10 years' time prior to age 70 (Smith,Cokkinides, & Eyre, 2003). Risk factors include smoking, onset of sex- ual intercourse prior to age 18, and multiplesexual partners. Screening offers the opportu-nity of early treatment. A new vaccine is beingresearched using the human papillomavirus toprevent cervical cancer. The symptoms of cervical cancer are not usu- ally evident in early stages, but may includevaginal bleeding, generally without pain untillater stages. Prognosis is good if detected early.Most early precancerous lesions can be success-fully treated with laser or cryotherapy. Tradi-tional treatment for cancer generally includesradiation and/or surgery, depending on the stageof progression.Breast CancerBreast cancer is the second leading cause ofdeath for women. This disease claims more than40,000 lives per year and affects over 200,000people annually in the United States (AmericanCancer Society, 2005b). The incidence of breastcancer in women over age 50 has increased inrecent years. Half of all breast cancers are diag-nosed in women over the age of 65 (NationalBreast Cancer Foundation, 2005). Men may alsodevelop breast cancer, though this is much lessfrequent, and they should not be excluded fromeducation about the disease. Screening guidelines for older women include mammography, yearly clinical breastexam (CBE), and monthly self breast exam(SBE). As of age 40, women should have mam-mography yearly until age 75, and then every2-3 years thereafter. There are several risk factors for breast can- cer, some controllable, some not. These includefamily history, late menopause, having the firstchild after age 30, high fat intake, and alcoholconsumption. Of course, primary nursing carefocuses on those factors that can be modified.Geriatric nurses should be particularly aware ofthe importance of early detection among thoseolder women who are at higher risk. Signs and symptoms of breast cancer include a breast mass or lump, breast asymmetry, dim-pling of the skin or \"orange peel\" appearance,and Fletcher,& Plank, 2000). Mammography and biopsy inaddition to lab tests, chest x-ray, and bone scansare indicated for diagnosis ( Case Study 11-5 ). There are various stages of breast cancer. Stage I has a 98% survival rate at 5 years, whereas StageIV has a 16% survival rate at 5 years (NationalBreast Cancer Foundation, 2005). Treatment forbreast cancer depends on stage, but includes anycombination of radiation, chemotherapy, and/orsurgery. Depending on the type of tumor, hor-mone therapy may also be effective. Nursing care is important at all levels of pre- vention. Nurses working with older adultsshould encourage appropriate screening accord-ing to recommended guidelines. The elderlyshould be taught proper technique for self breastexam and encouraged to have regular checkupswith their physician. Although controversyexists over the use of mammography, it remainsan effective means to detect many canceroustumors at an earlier stage with minimal risk tothe person. For older women undergoing mastectomy as treatment for breast cancer, nurses may expect alonger time to be needed for recovery. Promotionof the return of full range of motion of the arm on28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 432 Genitourinary Problems 433 the operative side is essential. This may requirephysical therapy in addition to the psychosocialand emotional support involved in rehabilitation. Male Reproductive System The most common disorders among older menrelated to the reproductive system includebenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) , cancer of the prostate, (ED) or impotence. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (orHypertrophy) (BPH)BPH, also known as prostatism, results from anoncancerous enlargement of the prostate glandthat is associated with advanced age. This condi-tion affects 50% of men age 51-60 and up to90% of men over 80 years (American UrologicalAssociation, 2005a). Although the enlargementis benign, it is sometimes associated with prostatecancer, so men with this condition should be care-fully monitored. BPH occurs when the enlarged prostate squeezes the urethra it encompasses and causesrelated symptoms. The symptoms include adecreased urinary stream, frequency, urgency,nocturia, and urinary incontinence(Table 11-20 ). The urge to void may be so fre- quent in men with BPH (every 2 hours) that itcan interfere with sleep and activities of dailyliving. Risk factors for BPH include advancedage and family history. Diagnosis is made using any number or com- bination of tests and studies including urinaly-sis, postvoiding residual, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) , urodynamic studies, ultra- sound, and cystoscopy. Medical treatment gen-erally includes medications and surgery. Thetwo most frequently used types of medicationsQuestions: 1.

What is wrongwith me?\"Case Study 11-528438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 433 434 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions assessing the color of the urine draining fromthe catheter. The urine in the tube should becharted with specific terms such as bright red,brick red, tea colored, amber, yellow, or clear.The number and size of clots draining from thecatheter should be described. The goal of theCBI is to flush the bladder, so the nurse mustregulate the rate of the fluid to keep the urineyellow or as clear as possible. CBI will continuepostoperatively until the bleeding stops.Bleeding complications may result if the CBI isallowed to go dry or the catheter is removed toosoon after surgery. In the event that the patientis unable to void after removal of the catheterpost-TURP , the catheter may need to be rein-serted by doctor's order. If the nurse is unable toreinsert the catheter, the physician may need tobe called in to do this. Nurses should be partic-ularly alert to the potential for complications inolder men after this procedure.Prostate CancerProstate cancer is the second leading cause ofcancer death in U.S. males, with an estimate ofover 30,000 deaths predicted for 2005. One in 6men will have prostate cancer in his lifetime, butmortality (1 in 33) has declined (AmericanCancer Society, 2005). The incidence of prostatecancer increases with age. Over half of men 70and older show some histologic evidence, thoughonly a small percentage die from this disease. Older men with prostate cancer may be asymptomatic, so screening is still recom-mended. If present, symptoms of prostate can-cer may include urinary urgency, nocturia,painful ejaculation, blood in the urine or semen,and pain or stiffness in the back or thighs(Medline Plus, 2005). Risk factors of prostatecancer include advanced age, a diet high in sat-urated fats, family history, and ethnicity (Afri- are work to symp-toms of BPH by relaxing the smooth muscle ofthe prostate and bladder neck to allow urine toflow more easily. A 5-alpha-reductase inhibitorsuch as finasteride (Proscar) works differentlyby shrinking the prostate to promote urineflow, but has sexual side effects such as impo-tence (American Urological Association, 2005a;Mead, 2005). A common surgical intervention for BPH is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . During this procedure, urologist resects gland through acystoscope ( Figure ). Older men sometimes call this the \"Rotor Rooter\" surgery. Nursingcare after this procedure is essential to avoidcomplications related to the heavy bleeding thatmay occur. The patient will have an indwellingurinary catheter with three ports. Postopera-tively, continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) must be maintained to prevent dangerous clot-ting of the blood. The nurse is responsible forTable 11-20 Signs and Symptoms of NocturiaUrinary incontinenceIncomplete bladder emptyingUrinary dribblingFeelings of urge to void but difficulty starting urine stream Decreased quality of life related to symptoms Altered sleep patterns related to nocturia28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 434 Genitourinary Problems 435 can Americans slightly higher than whites, andlow incidence among Asian males; Bradway &Yetman, 2002). Diagnosis of prostate cancer begins with a digital rectal exam and PSA test. The rectalexam may detect malignancy in the form of ahard, nodular prostate. A PSA of less than 4ng/ml is considered normal for age 60-69 years,whereas 7 ng/ml may be normal in the 70-79age group, because PSA rises with age. Sixtypercent of men with a PSA above 10 ng/ml haveprostate cancer (Bradway & Yetman, 2002;Mead, 2005). Diagnosis can only be confirmedthrough biopsy, however. Although recently thePSA test has been questioned as a reliablescreening test, many urologists believe it is \"stillthe best tool for early diagnosis\" (Crawford,2005, p. 1450). A series of PSA tests is the mosteffective means of screening, because a rise of20% over a year (greater than 0.75 ng/ml peryear) generally indicates cancer (Mead, 2005). Treatment depends on the stage of cancer growth, but for more localized cancers generallyincludes three major options: radical prosta- tectomy , radiation therapy, and surveillance. Surgery is considered the best option when theFigure 11-8 TURP. Resection instrumentProstateBladder Loop Source: Leonard Crowley, Introduction to Human Disease (6th ed.). Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 435 436 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions cancer is caught early. However, because a radi-cal prostatectomy is major surgery and carriessome inherent risks, all options should be con-sidered with the older patient. The major prob-lems after surgery to remove the prostateinclude urinary incontinence (which is oftentemporary) and impotence. The skill and expe-rience of the surgeon can decrease the risk ofurinary incontinence after surgery to 2%-5%(American Urological Association, 2005b). New treatments being explored for prostate cancer include the implantation of radioactiveseeds and Vitamin E from select plant seeds(Medline Plus, 2005). A holistic approach tocare may include dietary changes such as a lowfat diet and the addition of Vitamin E, sele-nium, and soy protein (Bradway & Yetman,2002). Nursing care surrounding treatment for pro- state cancer will involve helping families toexplore the options, linking them to communityresources, and providing education related tomanaging postoperative complications if surgeryis indicated. Geriatric nurses should be informedas to the various options available for treatmentof impotence that accompanies this type of sur-gery. Couples should be provided with supportgroup information as well as information onpenile implants and other devices that patientsmay wish to consider after recovery.Erectile Dysfunction (ED)Erectile dysfunction, also known as impotence,is defined as the inability to achieve and sustaina sufficient erection for intercourse. ED is preva-lent in approximately 70% of men age 70 andover (Reuben, Herr, Pacala, Pollock, Potter, &Semla, 2004). One in every 6 American men isaffected by ED (10-20 million). The incidenceof ED increases with age, but it is not inevitableand is highly treatable in many cases. The causesof ED may be many, including diabetes, hyper-tension, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury,thyroid disorders, alcoholism, renal failure,hypogonadism, other diseases, medications(Table 11-21 ), and psychological factors. Treatment options for ED fall into several categories including oral medications, vacuumpump devices, penile implants, and drugsinjected into the penis. Sildenafil (Viagra) is anoral medication that is taken 1 hour prior to sex-ual activity. It is contraindicated in those withheart disease and may result in some cardiovas-cular-related side effects including headache,flushing, and nasal congestion. Other oral prod-ucts on the market (Cialis, Levitra) are based onsimilar principles. A recent complaint aboutViagra is the possibility of irreversible visualimpairment in some men, but screenings forthose at increased risk of this complication(those with certain characteristics in the innereye being at higher risk) can be done by mostphysicians or eye doctors. Vacuum devices have a good acceptance in the elderly population, with a 70%-90% suc-cess rate (Reuben et al., 2004). These deviceswork in various ways to pump or draw blood Table 11-21 Medications That May Affect Sexual Function AnticholinergicsDigoxinAntihypertensivesSedativesHypnoticsTranquilizersAntidepressants Sleeping medications28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 436 into the penis and use another mechanism suchas a ring around the base of the penis to helpsustain the erection for intercourse. Risks fromuse of this device would include bruising orbleeding (in extreme cases). Nursing instructionto couples on the use of such a device is essen-tial to prevent harm. Other treatments for EDinclude medications that may be injecteddirectly into the penis to cause temporary erec-tion, and some persons may opt for having sur-gery to insert a penile implant. Penile implantsmay be the type that results in permanent erec-tion or a type that may be pumped to cause erec-tion and then released. All options should beexplored with persons wishing information ontreatment of ED. Neurological Disorders There are several neurological disorders com-mon to the elderly, including diseases and con-ditions that are often secondary to commondiseases. Two of the most frequently occurringneurological diseases in the elderly will be dis-cussed here: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) . Stroke may also be considered a neurological disorder, but was dis-cussed previously in the section on circulationproblems. Complications that affect the neuro-logical system as a result of a variety of causesmay include seizures, tremor (see discussion onPD), peripheral neuropathy (see discussion ondiabetes), and dizziness. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commontype of dementia seen in older adults. Otherforms of dementia include vascular dementia,dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson'sdementia. Care of the person with AD providesNeurological Disorders 437 an example of nursing interventions for all per-sons with dementia. Advanced age is the singlemost significant risk factor for AD. AD affectsabout 4.5 million Americans, with a projected11.3-16 million American diagnosed with ADby 2050 (Alzheimer's Association, 2005). Thoseaffected with AD may live from 3-20 years ormore after diagnosis, making the lifespan withthis disease highly variable. Seventy percent ofpeople with AD live at home until the lateststages, being cared for mainly by family mem-bers (Alzheimer's Association, 2005). These sta-tistics reveal that AD has and will continue tohave a great impact on our society. AD is characterized by progressive memory loss. It is a terminal disease that over its coursewill eventually leave a person completely depen-dent upon others for care. The disease is grad-ual, with an average lifespan of 8 years (Cotter,2002). The underlying pathology, with an un-known etiology, behind the disease is a growthof plaques and fibrillary tangles that interferewith normal cell growth and the ability of thebrain to function. Absolutely definitive diagno-sis is still through autopsy, although clinicalguidelines make diagnosis easier than decadesago when less was known about the disease. The clinical course of AD is divided into sev- eral stages, depending on the source consulted.For the purposes of this text, early, middle, andlate phases will be described. However, it shouldbe noted that the Alzheimer's Association listsseven stages for AD, with no symptoms to mildsymptoms and diagnosis occurring in the firstthree phases. In the early course of AD, the per-son may demonstrate a loss of short-term mem-ory. This involves more than common memoryloss such as where the keys were put, and mayinvolve safety concerns such as forgetting whereone is going while driving. The inability to28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 437 438 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions perform math calculations and to thinkabstractly may also be evident. In the middle ormoderate phase, many bodily systems begin todecline. The person may become confused as todate, time, and place. Communication skillsbecome impaired and personality changes mayoccur. As cognitive decline worsens, the personmay forget the names of loved ones, even theirspouse. Wandering behavior as well as emotionalchanges, screaming, delusions, hallucinations,suspiciousness, and depression are common. Theperson with AD is less able to care for her- orhimself and personal hygiene suffers. In the mostsevere and final phase, the person becomes com-pletely dependent upon others, experiences asevere decline in physical and functional health,loses communication skills, and is unable to con-trol voluntary functions. Death eventuallyresults from body systems shutting down. Although there is no single test, and the diagnosis may be one of exclusion, early diag-nosis is important to maximize function andquality of life for as long as possible. Personsexperiencing recurring and progressing memoryproblems or difficulties with daily activitiesshould seek professional assistance from theirphysician. Warning signs of Alzheimer's arelisted in Table 11-22. Treatment for AD is difficult. There are sev- eral medications (such as Aricept, Namenda, andRazadyne) that may help symptoms (such asmemory), but they do not slow the course of thedisease. There is currently no cure. Nursing carewill focus on symptom management, particu-larly in the areas of behavior, safety, nutrition,and hygiene. Dealing with behavioral issuessuch as wandering and outbursts poses a con-stant challenge. Recently, many long-term carefacilities have instituted special units to care forAlzheimer's patients from the early to late stagesof the disease. These units provide great bene- fits such as consistent and educated caregiverswith whom the patient or resident will be famil-iar, a safe and controlled environment, modifiedsurroundings to accommodate wanderingbehaviors, and nursing care 24 hours a day.Additionally, nurses are present to manage med-ications and document outcomes of therapies.However, many family members wish to care fortheir loved ones at home for as long as possible. Thus, another important aspect of care in AD is care for the caregivers. Howcroft (2004) sug-gested that \"support from carers is a key factorin the community care of people with dementia,but the role of the caregiver can be detrimentalto the physical, mental, and financial health ofa carer\" (p. 31). She goes on to say that the care-givers of persons with AD would benefit fromtraining in how to cope with behaviors that arisein these patients and how to cope with practicaland legal issues that may arise. Research from Paun, Farran, Perraud, and Loukissa (2004) showed that ongoing skills wereneeded by family caregivers to deal with the pro-gressive decline caused by AD. Adapting tostress, working on time management, maximiz-ing resources, and managing changing behaviorTable 11-22 Ten Warning Signs of Alzheimer's Disease Memory lossDifficulty performing familiar tasksProblems with languageDisorientation to time and placePoor or decreased judgmentProblems with abstract thinkingMisplacing thingsChanges in mood or behaviorChanges in Loss of initiative Source: Alzheimer's Association, 2005.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 438 Neurological Disorders 439 were all skills caregivers needed to develop inorder to successfully manage home care of theirloved ones. Caregivers needed not only to acquireknowledge and skills, but also to make emotionaladjustments themselves to the ever-changing sit-uation. Such findings suggest that nurses shouldfocus a good deal of time on educating caregiversof persons with AD to cope with, as NancyReagan put it, \"the long good-bye.\" Scientists continue to explore the causes of AD and hope in the near future to be able to iso-late the gene that causes it. In the meantime,results from a fascinating study (called the nunstudy) on a group of nuns who donated theirbrains to be examined and autopsied after deathhas suggested that there is a connection betweenearly \"idea density\" and the emergence of AD inlater life. That is, essays that the nuns wroteupon entry to the convent were analyzed andcorrelated with those who developed AD. It wasfound that those with lower idea density (verbaland linguistic skills) in early life had a signifi-cantly greater chance of developing AD(Snowden, 2004). The nun study has allowedresearchers to examine about 500 brains so farin nuns who died between 75 and 107 years ofage and discover other important facts such asa relationship between stroke and the develop-ment of AD in certain individuals, and the roleof folic acid in protecting against developmentof AD (Snowden, 2004). Scientists from a num-ber of fields continue to research the causes andpossible treatments for AD. Snowden's researchsuggests that early education, particularly inverbal and cognitive skills, may protect personsfrom AD in later life. Parkinson's Disease (PD) PD is one of the most common neurological dis-eases. It affects both men and women, particu-larly those over the age of 50 years (AmericanParkinson Disease Foundation, 2005). PD wasfirst described by Dr. James Parkinson as the\"shaking palsy,\" so named to describe the motortremors witnessed in those experiencing thiscondition. A degenerative, chronic, and slowly pro- gressing disease, PD has no known etiology,though several causes are suspected. There is afamily history in 15% of cases. Some believe avirus or environmental factors play a significantrole in the development of the disease. A higherrisk of PD has been noted in teachers, medicalworkers, loggers, and miners, suggesting thepossibility of a respiratory virus being to blame.More recent theories blame herbicides or pesti-cides. An emerging theory discusses PD like aninjury related to an event or exposure to a toxinversus a disease. Interestingly, coffee drinkingand cigarettes are thought to have a protectiveeffect in the development of PD (Films for theHumanities and Sciences, 2004). PD is a disorder of the central nervous system in which nerve cells in the basal ganglia degener-ate. A loss of neurons in the substantia nigra of thebrainstem causes a reduction in the production ofthe neurotransmitter dopamine, which is respon-sible for fine motor movement. Dopamine isneeded for smooth movement and also plays a rolein feelings and emotions. One specific pathologi-cal marker is called the Lewy body, which under amicroscope appears as a round, dying neuron.There is no one specific test to diagnose PD. The signs and symptoms of PD are many; however, there are four cardinal signs: bradykine-sia (slowness of movement), rigidity, tremor, andgait changes. A typical patient with PD symp-toms will have some distinctive movement char-acteristics with the components of stiffness,shuffling gait, arms at the side when walking,incoordination, and a tendency to fall backwards.Not all patients exhibit resting tremor, but most28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 439 440 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions have problems with movement, such as difficultystarting movement, increased stiffness with pas-sive resistance, and rigidity as well as freezing dur-ing motion (National Institute of NeurologicalDisease and Stroke [NINDS], 2005). Additionalsigns, symptoms, and associated characteristics ofPD appear in Table 11-23. Advanced PD may result in Parkinson's dementia. Nurses should note that several other condi- tions may cause symptoms similar to PD, suchas the neurological effects of tremor and move-ment disorders. These may be attributed to theeffects of drugs or toxins, Alzheimer's disease,vascular diseases, or normal pressure hydro-cephalus, and not be true PD. Management of PD is generally done through medications. Levodopa, a synthetic dopamine,is an amino acid that converts to dopaminewhen it crosses the blood-brain barrier.Levodopa helps most of the serious signs andsymptoms of PD. The drug helps at least 75%of persons with PD, mainly with the symptomsof bradykinesia and rigidity (NINDS, 2005).One important side effect to note is hallucina-tions. A more common treatment, and generallythe drug of choice, involves a medication thatcombines levodopa and carbidopa (Sinemet),resulting in a decrease in the side effect of nau-sea seen with levodopa therapy alone, but withthe same positive control of symptoms, partic-ularly with relation to movement. Selegiline isanother medication that interferes with one ofthe enzymes that breaks down dopamine.Dopamine receptor agonists such as Permax andParlodel are synthetic compounds that mimicthe effect of dopamine, but are not as powerfulas levodopa. The earliest drugs used were anti-cholinergics such as Artane and Cogentin, andnewer medications are being examined in clin-ical studies. Medications such as Sinemet show a wearing off effect, generally over a 2-yearperiod. During this time, the person must takelarger doses of the medication to achieve thesame relief of symptoms that a smaller dose usedto bring. For an unknown reason, if the med-ication is stopped for about a week to 10 days,Table 11-23 Signs, Symptoms, and Associated Problems Seen in Person's with PD BradykinesiaRigidityTremorPill rollingIncoordinationShuffling gait, arms at 4:21 PM Page 440 the body will reset itself and the person will beable to restart the medication at the lower doseagain until tolerance is again reached. This tak-ing off time from the medication is called a\"drug holiday,\" and is a time when the personand family need extra support, because the per-son's symptoms will be greatly exacerbatedwithout the medication. There are many other treatments for Parkin- son's disease being explored. These include deepbrain stimulation (DBS), with electrode-likeimplants that act much like a pacemaker to con-trol PD tremors and other movement problems.The person using this therapy will still have thedisease and generally uses medications in com-bination with this treatment, but may requirelower doses of medication (NINDS, 2005).Thalamotomy, or surgical removal of a group ofcells in the thalamus, is used in severe cases oftremor. Similarly, pallidotomy involves destruc-tion of a group of cells in the internal globuspallidus, an area where information leaves thebasal ganglia. In this procedure, nerve cells inthe brain are permanently destroyed. Fetal tissue transplants have been done exper- imentally in Sweden with mild success in olderadults and more success among patients whosePD symptoms were a result of toxins. Stem celltransplant uses primitive nerve cells harvestedfrom a surplus of embryos and fetuses from fer-tility clinics. This practice, of course, poses anethical dilemma and has been the source ofmuch controversy and political discussion. A more recent promising development in- cludes the use of adult stem cells, a theory thatis promising but not yet well researched. Cellsmay be taken from the back of the eyes of organdonors. These epithelial cells from the retina aremicro-carriers of gelatin that may have enoughcells in a single retina to treat 10,000 patients(Films for the Humanities and Sciences, 2004).This is a more practical and ethically pleasingsource of stem cells than embryos. Much of the nursing care in PD is related to education. Because PD is a generally chronicand slowly progressing disorder, patients andfamily members will need much instructionregarding the course of the disease and what toanticipate. Instruction in the areas of medica-tions, safety promotion, prevention of falls, dis-ease progression, mobility, bowel and bladder,potential swallowing problems, sleep promo-tion, and communication are important. Mostof the problems seen as complications of PD arehandled via the physician as an outpatient, butcertainly complications such as swallowing dis-orders as the disease progresses may requireperiods of hospitalization. When persons sufferrelated dementia in the last phases of the dis-ease, they are often cared for in long-term carefacilities that are equipped to handle the chal-lenges and safety issues related to PD dementia.Areas for teaching appear in Table 11-24 . In addition, access to resources and support groupsare essential. A list of helpful resources andagencies is provided in Box 11-5 . Dizziness Dizziness is quite common in older adults, affect-ing about 30% of those over age 65, and is themost common complaint in those over 75 whoare seen by office physicians (Hill-O'Neill &Shaughnessy, 2002). There are four major (related to it does not fit in any othercategories). Presyncope is when the older personcomplains of feeling faint or light-headed. It isassociated with a drop in blood pressure such asNeurological Disorders 44128438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 441 442 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions occurs when the person sits up or changes to astanding position suddenly. It can be caused bymedications that induce orthostatic hypotension,hypovolemia, low blood sugar, or some othercause of lack of blood flow to the brain. Othercauses of the various types of dizziness mentionedabove include cerebral ischemia, side effects ofmedications, Parkinsonian symptoms, hypoten-sion, low blood sugar, anxiety attacks, and benignpositional vertigo. Dizziness is generally treatableby addressing the cause. However, in some cases,such as dizziness associated with poststroke, itcan be a permanent impairment. Otological dizziness (a major classification in the elderly, according to Hain and Ramaswamy[2005]), refers to vertigo caused by changes inthe vestibular system. The most common typesin the elderly are Meniere's syndrome and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV ). These two major causes of dizziness will be dis-cussed here. Meniere's SyndromeMeniere's syndrome is common in those overage 50. The cause is unknown, though it is oftenTable 11-24 Client/Family Teaching Regarding PD Key Areas Medication therapy (side effects, wearing off, drug holidays, role of diet in absorption)Safety promotion/fall preventionDisease progressionEffects of disease on bowel and bladder, sleep, nutrition, attention, self-care, communication, sexuality, and mobility Swallowing problemsPromoting sleep and relaxationCommunicationRole changesCaregiver stress/burden\u2014need for respite Community resources Source: Adapted from Easton, 1999, with permission.

Signsand symptoms include a rapid decrease in hear-ing, a sense of pressure or fullness in one ear,accompanied by loud tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and then vertigo (Hain & Ramaswamy,2005; Hill-O'Neill & Shaughnessy, 2002). Afeeling of being unsteady or dizzy may even lastfor days after the episode.Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo(BPPV)BPPV is the most common cause of dizzinessin the older age group, accounting for as muchas 50% of all dizziness, with an increasingincidence with age (Hain, 2003). BPPV occurswhen the debris called otoconia (\"rocks in the ears\") become dislodged from their usual placein the ear and get stuck elsewhere in the ves-tibular system. Although in most cases theunderlying cause of BPPV is not known, the de-generation of the vestibular system in theinner ear that occurs with normal aging isthought to play a major role. In cases of ver-tigo that do not respond to traditional med-ication for dizziness (such as Antivert), BPPVshould be suspected. Signs and symptoms of BPPV include dizzi- ness, presyncope, feelings of imbalance, andnausea. The symptoms begin when the personchanges head position, even something as usualas tipping the head back or turning the head inbed. A key to diagnosis is Hallpike's manuever,in which the patient is laid down quickly froma sitting position with the head turned to theside and hung over the back of the exam table.This will produce a characteristic nystagmus ifthe cause is BPPV . BPPV can be treated in the office by the physician, advanced practice nurse, or even aphysical therapist with knowledge of the properNeurological Disorders 443 maneuvers. The Epley maneuver is a techniqueby which the patient is put into a serious of spe-cific positions and head turns to promote returnof the otoconia to their proper place in the ear.After this treatment, the patient must stay in theoffice for 10 minutes and then sleep in a reclinerchair at 45 degrees for the following two nights.They should also be instructed to avoid headpositions that cause BPPV for at least anotherweek (Hain, 2003). Other maneuvers and evensurgical treatment may be necessary in rare vari-ations of BPPV . These would be recommendedby the physician on a case-by-case basis. Dizziness, whatever the cause, can be particu- larly distressing to the older adult. It can inter-fere with activities of daily living, the ability todrive, and the maintenance of independence.Elders may decrease activities and spend moretime at home due to the fear of dizzy spells or offalling. Early diagnosis of the cause of dizzinesscan result in better outcomes by addressing treat-ment sooner and avoiding complications that canresult from bouts of syncope or vertigo. Nursesshould encourage older adults with complaints ofdizziness to seek medical help. Treatment may bewith medication or simple maneuvers or lifestylechanges. Emotional support during diagnosis andtesting, and reassurance that most causes of dizzi-ness are treatable, can be a comfort to the olderadult with this problem. Seizures Once thought to be mainly a disorder of chil-dren, recurrent seizures or epilepsy is thought tobe present in about 7% of older adults (Spitz,2005). Of the general population, epilepsy af-fects up to 3 million Americans (Velez & Selwa,2003). Seizures can be caused by a variety of condi- tions in older persons, but \"the most common28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 443 444 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions cause of new-onset epilepsy in an elderly per-son is arteriosclerosis and the associated cere-brovascular disease\" (Spitz, 2005, p. 1),accounting for 40%-50% of seizures in thisage group (Rowan & Tuchman, 2003). Seizuresare associated with sur-vivors (Spitz, 2005; Velez & in the elderlyinclude Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor.A list of potential causes of seizures in olderadults appears in Table 11-25 . There are three major classifications of epilepsies. Generalized types are more commonin young people and associated with grand malor tonic-clonic seizures. A number of cases havean undetermined origin and may be associatedwith certain situations such as high fever, expo-sure to toxins, or rare metabolic events. In olderadults, localized (partial or focal) epilepsies aremore common, particularly complex partialseizures. In contrast to young adults, Rowan andTuchman (2003) cite other differences inseizures in the elderly: low frequency of seizureactivity, easier to control, high potential forinjury, a prolonged post-ictal period, and bettertolerance with newer antiepileptic drugs(AEDs). Additionally, older adults may havecoexisting medical problems and take manymedications to treat these problems. Signs and symptoms of epilepsy include seizures as the most obvious, although changesin behavior, cognition, and level of conscious-ness may be other signs. Diagnosis is made bycareful description of the seizure event, a thor-ough history and physical, complete bloodwork, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), andelectroencephalogram (EEG) to help determinethe type of seizure. Treatment for epilepsy is aimed at the causal factor. The standard treatment for recurrentseizures is AEDs. The rule of thumb \"start lowand go slow\" for medication dosing in olderadults particularly applies to AEDs. The elderlytend to have more side effects, adverse druginteractions, and problems with toxicity levelsthan younger people. Recent research has suggested that older adults may have better results with fewer sideeffects with the newer AEDs than the traditionalones, though about 10% of nursing home resi-dents are still medicated with the first generationAEDs (Mauk, 2004). The most common med-ications used to treat seizures include barbiturates(such as phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (such asdiazepam/Valium), valproicacid/Depakene) (Deglin & Vallerand, 2005). Sev-eral newer drugs are also used, depending on thetype of seizure. These newer medications includecarbamazapine (Tegretol), oxycarbazepine (Tri-leptal), and topiramate (Topamax) (Uthman,2004). Each of these medications has specific pre-cautions for use in patients with certain types ofmedical problems or for those taking certain Table 11-25 Possible Causes of Seizures in the Elderly Stroke or other cerebrovascular diseaseArteriosclerosisAlzheimer's diseaseBrain tumorHead traumaIntracranial 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 444 Musculoskeletal Disorders 445 other medications. When assessing for side effectsin older patients, be sure to be alert to potentialGI, renal, and hepatic side effects. Additionally,some newer extended-release AEDs are thoughtto be better tolerated and have a lower incidenceof systemic side effects (such as tremors)(Uthman, 2004). Musculoskeletal Disorders Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a bone disorder characterized by low bone density or porous bones. Over 44million Americans including 55% of adults age50 and over have this disease. Although oftenthought of as a woman's disease, 80% of casesare women and 20% are men (National Osteo-porosis Foundation, 2005). Older persons of allethnic backgrounds may experience osteoporo-sis, though it is more common among whitesand Asians. The risk factors for this disorder aremany, and appear in Table 11-26 . A major complication of osteoporosis is frac- tures. These are especially common in the ver-tebral spine, hips, and wrists. The cost in 2002related to osteoporotic hip fractures alone wasmore than $18 billion (National OsteoporosisFoundation, 2005). Because there are sometimesno signs or symptoms during the early course of Table 11-26 Risk Factors for Osteoporosis Personal history of fracture after age 50 Current low bone mass History of fracture in a first-degree relative Being female Being thin and/or having a small frame Advanced age A family history of osteoporosis Estrogen deficiency as a result of menopause, especially early or surgically induced Abnormal absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) Anorexia nervosa Low lifetime calcium intake Vitamin D deficiency Use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids and anticonvulsants Presence of certain chronic medical conditions Low testosterone levels in men An inactive lifestyle Current cigarette smoking Excessive use of alcohol Being white or Asian, although African Americans and Hispanic Americans are at significant risk as well Source: From the National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2005, p. 1.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 445 446 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions Questions: 1. What are Mrs. Chiu's known risk factors for osteoporosis andresulting fractures? 2. How should you answer the family's questions? 3. Are the granddaughters at risk because Mrs. Chiu has osteo-porosis? If so, what can they doto prevent it? 4. What teaching should be done with this family?Mrs. Chiu is a small, 100-pound, 90-year-old Chinese woman with frac-tures of the vertebral spine. Because ofkyphosis and pain associated with os-teoporosis, Mrs. Chiu has been bed-bound in a nursing home for severalmonths. Her family visits regularlyand has many questions about hercondition, especially if it is somethingthat her teenage granddaughters mightdevelop.Case Study 11-6 bone deterioration, osteoporosis is often undiag-nosed and untreated until fracture occurs. Suchfractures may lead to immobility and other com-plications. If signs and symptoms are presentbesides fractures, they may take the form of painand kyphosis ( Figure 11-9 ). Diagnostic testing would reveal decreased bone density and anypathological fractures present via x-ray. Because this is a highly treatable and often preventable disease when detected early, allwomen over the age of 65 years should havebone mineral density (BMD) or bone mass measurement done. Steps can be taken to pre-vent osteoporosis by habits that help buildstrong bones before the age of 20, when bonesare fully developed. Preventing osteoporosis inadolescent years would include eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of calcium and vita-min D, no smoking or excessive alcohol intake,plenty of weight-bearing exercise, and dis-cussing any needed treatments with the physi-cian to minimize the risk of the disease. Itshould be noted that most of the calcium in thediet of American children comes from milk,though yogurt, broccoli, and certain enrichedcereals may provide additional sources. Nursescan be active in primary prevention of osteo-porosis through educating children in theschools about the effects of this disease in laterlife and how to prevent it. Treatment of existing osteoporosis takes many forms. Postmenopausal women are oftenprescribed biphosphonates (such as Fosamax),calcitonin (Miacalcin), or estrogen/hormonereplacement medications (such as Estratab orPremarin). Some of these medications are aimedat promoting adequate amounts of calcium in thebones, whereas the hormone replacement thera-pies replace estrogen not being produced aftermenopause to create more of a balance betweenthe delicate hormones that guide bone reabsorp-tion and demineralization. The use of estrogenreplacement therapy has been shown to decreasethe incidence of serious fractures in postmeno-28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 446 Musculoskeletal Disorders 447 pausal women, though there are side effects thatshould be discussed with the physician before awoman uses this option. Weight-bearing exer-cises and getting enough calcium in the diet orthrough supplementation are other treatments toconsider. Nurses should encourage patients todiscuss all treatment options with their physi-cians. Nutritional counseling and the role of sun-light and exercise should also be addressed. Arthritis Arthritis, or inflammation of the joint, is thenumber one chronic complaint and cause of dis-ability in the United States (Mayo Clinic,2005), affecting nearly 66 million people witha cost of $86.2 billion per year (ArthritisFoundation, 2005). There are over 100 types ofarthritis, with the two most common beingosteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis(RA). These will be discussed here in relation-ship to their impact on the lives of older adults. OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis (OA) is also called joint failure syn-drome or degenerative joint disease. OA affectsabout 21 million Americans (Mayo Clinic, 2005).Over half of those age 65 and over are affected(Yurkow & Yudin, 2002). This disease is charac-terized by chronic deterioration of the cartilage atthe ends of the bones that eventually results inbones at the joint rubbing against each other andthe formation of bone spurs. The cause of OA is unknown, but it affects females more often than males, and risk increaseswith certain factors. Persons who are over age 45,obese, have a history of sports injuries to thejoints, or those with a family history of OA arethought to be at increased risk. Weakness of themuscles around the knee joint is another predis-posing factor (Arthritis Foundation, 2005). Signs and symptoms of OA include pain, stiffness (especially in the morning), aching,some joint swelling, and inflammation. OA tar-gets joints such as the fingers, feet, knees, hips,and spine (Yurkow & Yudin, 2002). Heberden'snodes (bony fin-gers) and Bouchard's nodes (bony enlargementsat middle joints of fingers) are common ( Figure 11-10 ). Radiographs would show increased heat at the site of inflammation as well as bonedeterioration. As OA progresses, the individualmay experience crepitus, limping, limited rangeof motion, increased pain, and even fractures.Diagnosis is made through various lab test, x-rays, MRIs, or CT scans to Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions The most common associated complication of OA is pain. Although there is no cure for OA,treatment is generally aimed at symptom reduc-tion through lifestyle modifications, nonphar-macological therapies, and medication. Forexample, risk factors that can be modified suchas excessive stress to the joint (perhaps caused bysports or obesity) should be addressed with exer-cise programs for strengthening muscles andweight loss ( Case Study 11-6 ). Exercise pro- grams that are holistic and interdisciplinary,particularly those offered in rehabilitation units,may help individuals cope with pain andincrease functional levels. In addition, manypersons use alternative methods of pain controlin combination with medications. Table 11-27 provides a summary of common treatments forpain for those with OA. Medications used for treatment of OA include acetaminophen therapies injec-tion of steroids into the joint to decrease inflam-mation, or injection of synthetic material (suchas Synvisc) that acts as a lubricant in the absenceof synovial fluid to provide comfort. Other ther-apies to preserve motion and decrease pain in-clude heat or cold, splints, adaptive equipment,aquatic therapy, and nutrition. In cases of severedysfunction and pain, surgery with joint re-placement may be an option. Important for any nurse caring for older per- sons taking NSAIDs is the awareness of com-mon side effects. The most common adverseaffects of NSAIDs include gastrointestinalsymptoms such as stomach upset, nausea, vom-iting, and more seriously, gastric ulcers. COX-2 drugs were thought to minimize these effects,though more recently Vioxx and Celebrex aswell as other medications in this classificationhave come under scrutiny due to rare reports ofserious side effects such as MI and stroke (Moore,Derry, Makinson, & McQuay, 2005). Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)RA is characterized by remissions and exacerba-tions of inflammation within the joint. It affectsthe fingers, wrists, knees, and spine. In contrastto OA, RA is due to chronic inflammation thatcan cause severe joint deformities and loss offunction over time ( Figure 11-11 ). RA affects over 2 million Americans and is more common in women than men. RA is gen-erally diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50and can cause significant disability for adultswho live into old age with this disorder (MayoClinic, 2005). Although the cause is unknown,researchers believe it may be due to a virus orhormonal factors. Risk factors for RA include being female, having a certain predisposing gene, and expo-Figure for Pain Osteoarthritis Pharmacological NonpharmacologicalAcetaminophen Moist heatAspirin Warm paraffin wrapsNSAIDs Stretch gloves or stockingsCapsaicin (topically, with other therapies) Range of motionNabumetone Exercises Upper extremity activities (such as piano playing, typing, car playing) SwimmingAdaptive equipmentHeat/cold applicationsWarm bath (limit to 20 minutes)Good postureSupportive shoesWell-balanced diet Maintenance of appropriate weight Source: From Easton, 1999, p. 292; adapted with permission.

Advanced age is a risk fac-tor until age 70, after which incidence decreases.Cigarette smoking over a period of years isanother risk factor. Signs and symptoms of RA are systemic and include malaise, fatigue, symmetrical patterns ofjoint inflammation, pain, stiffness, swelling,gelling (joints stiff after rest), elevated sedimen-tation rate, presence of serum rheumatoid factor,and elevated WBC in fluid of theinflamed joint. Radiographs will show erosion ofthe bone. Pain is more prevalent in RA, andjoint deformities can cause more debilitationthan is generally seen with OA. In addition, RAoften strikes in young to middle adulthood, withmore degeneration seen over time than with OA. The treatment for RA is similar to OA with the exception that anti-inflammatory andimmune-suppressing drugs may play a moreimportant role. DMARDs (disease-modifyinganti-rheumatic drugs) are also used in RA.These medications may not show results for sev-eral months, and nurses should teach patients torecognize signs of infections such as chills, pain,and fever. Nurses should expect to see many complica- tions associated with arthritis. Some potentialnursing diagnoses are pain, impaired physicalmobility, fatigue, decreased endurance, power-lessness, self-care deficits, sleep pattern distur-bance, depression, impaired coping, socialisolation, fear, anxiety, and body-image distur-bance. Goals for care include promoting inde-pendence within limitations, pain management,and education. Educational programs for persons with arth- ritis should include exercise and mobility, edu-cation, counseling, individual PT and OT, anda focus of independence in activities of daily living (ADLS) with self-care. These types ofprograms help decrease disability, pain, and theneed for assistance, as well as reduce joint ten-derness. Pain coping and exercise training mayalso enhance pain control. Joint Replacement Joint replacement is used for several differentpurposes including fracture, immobility, and in-tractable pain. The two most commonly per-formed joint replacement surgeries are total hiparthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. Kneereplacements are mainly related to advancedarthritis that causes severe pain with decreasedfunction. Hip replacements may be done relatedto arthritis or due to fracture, usually from falling. Dunlop, Song, Manheim, and Chang (2003) reported significantly less numbers of jointreplacements done on Hispanics and blacks thanwhites, due to reasons beyond access and finan-cial resources. The researchers suggested thatcultural differences, values, and attitudes mayalso play a role in seeking joint replacement.Total Hip Arthroplasty/ReplacementHip replacement surgery may be indicatedwhen an older person demonstrates lack of func-tion, trouble with ADLs, and continued painthat is not sufficiently addressed with tradi-tional medical therapy. Certainly those with cer-tain types of hip fractures will be candidates forthis surgery also. In women, body weight andolder age have been found to be risk factors forneeding hip replacement due to OA (NationalInstitute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal andSkin Diseases, 2003). During hip replacement, a prosthetic device made of metal and plastic is substituted for theworn out, damaged, or fractured portions of thehip. The implant is made of a ball-type deviceon a stem that fits into the femur. The socket of28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 450 Musculoskeletal Disorders 451 the pelvis helps hold the ball that is articulatedonto the joint ( Figure 11-12 ). During surgery, physicians may choose to cement the prosthesisinto the femur or not. Postoperatively, the per-son will stay in acute care for several days to aweek, and then many older adults may needrehabilitation services as inpatients or outpa-tients, depending on comorbidities and physi-cal condition. Weight bearing is progressive anddepends upon the physician's orders based onthe condition of the bones observed during sur-gery. It is essential that the nurse and other teammembers strictly observe weight-bearing in-structions (such as toe-touch, partial, or full) toavoid injury to the healing hip. Dislocation ofthe prosthesis can also result from not followingroutine hip precautions after surgery. Routinehip precautions include not crossing the legs atthe knees or ankles, not bending in the chairmore than 90 degrees, keeping a pillow betweenthe knees (maintain abduction) until deter-mined by the physician, and avoiding lying onthe operative side until the physician gives per-mission to do so. Nursing instruction to patients and family members should include watching for signs andsymptoms of wound infection. Patients shouldreport any redness, swelling, drainage, or odorfrom the operative site. A small amount ofbrownish drainage from the site a few days post-operatively is normal. Staples are generally usedto close the wound, with a nonstick dressingapplied. Staples are usually removed 7-10 daysafter surgery, depending on healing of the Figure 11-12 Total hip prosthesis. Source: Leonard Crowley, Introduction to Human Disease (6th ed.). Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2005.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 451 452 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions wound. Sometimes physicians will order half ofthe staples removed initially and the other halflater. Steri strips may be applied to assist withwound edge approximation. Fever or malaisecould also be signs of infection and should bepromptly reported to the physician. Additionally, reminders about routine hip precautions, exercises and ambulation as indi-cated by the physical therapist, and travelingimplications should be given. Some prostheseswill cause the alarm at airport security to go off.Teach patients to inform security personnel oftheir hip prostheses prior to entering the secu-rity gate. Dr. Robert Zann, an orthopedic specialist, stated that recovery from hip replacement sur-gery is generally longer than many patientsthink: \"It is interesting that patients undergo-ing hip replacement surgery will uniformlyreach their maximum improvement between 1-2 years\" (p. 1). Physicians attribute this to theneed for tissue healing (of which 90% occurs inthe first 3 months) and return of muscles to nor-mal function and strength, which takes longer.Total Knee Arthroplasty/ReplacementSimilar to hip replacement, knee replacement isdone when a person is experiencing decreasedrange of motion, trouble walking or climbingstairs, and increased degeneration of the joint asto impair quality of life. This most often occursas a result of arthritis. Knee replacement surgery involves resurfac- ing or removal of the distal portion of the femurthat articulates with the end of the shin bone.The prosthesis consists of metal and plastic orsimilar materials that are cemented onto thenewly resurfaced areas of the articulating bones.Although often done under general anesthetic,this surgery can also be performed under spinalanesthesia. Sometimes blood loss is significant,so patients may be asked to donate their ownblood ahead of time to be given back to them inthe event it is needed. In addition, a growingtrend is towards bilateral knee replacement inthose persons requiring both knees to be surgi-cally repaired. The benefits of this are the one-time operative anesthetic and room costs, andmany physicians feel recovery from bilateralreplacement is similar to single replacement.However, the pain and lack of mobility, as wellas the significant increase in the assistanceneeded after surgery when a bilateral replace-ment is done, may make this less than ideal formost older patients. Discomfort after knee surgery is generally severe in the first few days. Nurses should encour-age patients to use cold packs on the operativearea for the first day and take pain and sleepingmedications as ordered. In addition, alternativetherapies such as guided imagery have beenshown to help with pain management (Antall &Kresevic, 2004). Many joint replacement patientsfeel a loss of control and independence. Nursescan help the recovery process by maintaining aprofessional therapeutic relationship with pa-tients. This has been shown to assist older personsin regaining their sense of independence (Loft,McWilliam, & Ward-Griffin, 2003). Therapy will begin immediately in the acute care hospital. Although weight bearing does notusually occur until 24 hours after surgery, sit-ting in a chair and using a continuous passivemotion machine (CPM) (if ordered) will easerecovery. The use of a CPM is generally based onthe surgeon's preference. There is research tosupport it, as well as studies indicating that walk-ing soon after surgery has an equal effect andmakes the CPM unnecessary. However, in casesof an older person who may not have the mobil-28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 452 ity skills initially after surgery that a youngerperson would, a CPM may be beneficial to keepthe joint flexible and decrease pain. Dr. Zann indicated that \"patients undergoing total knee replacement do not achieve their max-imum improvement until 2-4 years\" (p. 1). Thisis attributed to the lack of muscular structuresthat surround and protect the knee and the needfor the ligaments and tendons to adapt to theindwelling prosthesis. Recovery times vary anddepend upon a number of variables, including thepatient's overall health, age, comorbidities, andmotivation. Patients report that the new kneejoint never feels normal even years after the sur-gery, but they do experience an increase in func-tion and generally much less pain than before. Nursing implications include teaching the patient about signs and symptoms of infection,care of the surgical site (if staples are still pres-ent), pain management, and expectations forrecovery. A range of motion from 0-90 degreesis the minimum needed for normal functioning.Most prostheses will allow up to about 120degrees of flexion, though 110 degrees is con-sidered good range of motion after knee replace-ment. After discharge, a walker is usually usedin the first few weeks, followed by light activi-ties 6 weeks after surgery. In addition, thepatient's spouse may experience feelings of beingoverwhelmed due to role transitions that occurafter surgery and during the recovery period.Nurses can help facilitate this transition by pro-viding education and discussing realistic expec-tations (Showalter, Burger, & Salyer, 2000). Amputation According to the American Academy of PhysicalMedicine and Rehabilitation, physiatrists seeabout 50,000 new amputees annually (2005).Two thirds of these cases are from circulatoryMusculoskeletal Disorders 453 problems, particularly PVD related to diabetes.Most of the rest are attributed to trauma. Most amputations involve the lower extremi- ties, above or below the knee. The greatest riskfactor for amputation is diabetes with accompa-nying peripheral vascular disease. Advanced ageand the incidence of diabetes in the elderly makethis a potential problem in the older age group.Additionally, a recent study showed that HgbA1clevel was a significant predictor of foot amputa-tion (Watts, Daly, Anthony, McDonald, Khoury,& Dahar, 2001). In the acute phase of recovery after surgery, it is important to prevent contractures of the kneejoint (if present) and attempt to maintain nor-mal muscle power and range of motion in re-maining joints. The limb should not be hungover the bedside or placed in a dependent posi-tion. Both in acute care and rehabilitation, thestump should be conditioned to prepare for thewearing of a prosthesis. In certain circumstances,an older person may choose, in consultation withthe physician, not to wear a prosthesis. This gen-erally occurs when there are other health issuessuch as poor balance from another disease or dis-order that would make falling and injury morelikely with prosthetic use. Initially, there may be drainage from the sur- gical site, and a sterile dressing will be kept inplace and changed at least daily. Eventually, thestaples or sutures will be removed and a thick,black eschar will form at the amputation site andgradually come off. An ace wrap or stumpshrinker sock (elastic) is used to help prepare thestump for wearing the prosthesis. Several factorsshould be considered when preparing the stumpto wear a prosthesis. These include a movablescar, lack of tenderness/sensitivity, a conical shape,firm skin, and lack of edema. All of these can beachieved by proper wrapping of the stump to28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 453 454 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions In general, older persons with amputation may return to a normal quality of life with someadaptations. The care provided by nurses andphysicians in rehabilitation after amputationmay make the difference in the person's abilityto cope with the changes that result after sur-gery. Geriatric nurses can facilitate the transi-tion back into the community after amputationby educating patients and families about re-sources to assist with adaptation. Sensory Impairments Although there are many normal aging changesthat occur in the sensory system, most of thecommon abnormalities seen in the elderly relatedto vision. According to Lighthouse International,a leading resource on vision impairment andvisual rehabilitation, the most common age-related vision problems are cataracts, glaucoma,macular degeneration, and diabetic neuropathy(2005). This section will discuss these impair-ments and others. Diseases related to the sensesof touch, hearing, and taste are rare, though neu-ropathy will be addressed in a different section asrelated to diabetes. The other most common sen-sory problem in older adults is chronic sinusitis.This will also be discussed. Cataracts Cataracts are so common in older adults that some almost consider them an inevitable conse-quence of old age. The etiology is thought to befrom oxidative damage to lens protein that occurswith aging. Although about half of peoplebetween 65 and 75 years of age have cataracts,they are most common in those over age 75(70%), and there are no ethnic or gender varia-tions (Trudo & Stark, 1998, p. 2). The two mostcommon causes are advanced age and heredity,maximize shrinkage and minimize swelling. Theprone position, if tolerable, is an excellent way topromote full extension of the residual limb. It is also important for the person to begin therapy right away. The Merck Manual of Geri- atrics (Beers, 2005) states \"ambulation requires a 10 to 40% increase in energy expenditure afterbelow-the-knee amputation and a 60 to 100%increase after above-the-knee amputation. Tocompensate, elderly amputees generally walkmore slowly\" (p. 284). When using the pros-thesis at first, an older adult may tire easily. Besure to take into account any coexisting problemssuch as cardiopulmonary disease when consid-ering energy expenditure. The newest tech-nologies allow prosthetics to be light, durable,and more comfortable. Nurses will need to teach patients and fami- lies about stump care, mobility, adaptation, cop-ing, and self-care. Home maintenance, dealingwith complication and/or additional health prob-lems, wear and tear on nonweight-bearing joints,adapting to the environment, accessibility, stig-ma, depression, role changes, decreased energy,and chronic pain are all issues to be aware ofrelated to amputation. It is likely that the per-son with lower extremity amputation will expe-rience some shoulder problems over time due tothe additional stress on this nonweight-bearingjoint. Remember that alteration in body image isa significant hurdle to overcome for some indi-viduals. Phantom limb pain , or pain sensations in the nonexistent limb, is more common aftertraumatic amputations and may last for weeksafter amputation. Massage and medications mayhelp with this type of pain control ( Merck Manual for Geriatrics , 2005). Additionally, proper wrap- ping of the stump (in a figure-eight wrap) mayhelp decrease the chance of phantom limb painlater (Easton, 1999).28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 454 though contributing factors also include diabetes,poor nutrition, hypertension, excessive exposureto sunlight (ultraviolet radiation), cigarette smok-ing, high alcohol intake, and eye trauma (Light-house International, 2005). Cataracts cause no pain or discomfort, but persons will present with a gradual loss of visionthat may begin with complaints of vision beingfuzzy, sensitivity to glare, and noticing a haloeffect around lights. Decreased night vision anda yellowing of the lens, as well as trouble dis-tinguishing colors, may also be noted. Event-ually the pupil changes color to a cloudy white(Figure 11-13 ). Generally, the most common objective finding is decreased visual acuity, suchas that measured with a Snellen eye chart. Although changes in eyeglasses are the first option, when quality of life becomes affected,the most effective treatment to treat cataractsis surgery. This is the most common operationamong older adults, and more than 95% ofthem have better vision after surgery (Trudo &Stark, 1998). The benefits of surgery includeimproved visual acuity, depth perception, andperipheral vision, leading to better outcomesrelated to ADLs and quality of life. Complica-tions associated with surgery are rare butinclude retinal detachment, infection, andmacular edema. Surgery is relatively safe anddone as an outpatient procedure. The lens isremoved through an incision in the eye and anintraocular lens is inserted. The surgical inci-sion is either closed with sutures or can healitself. After surgery, patients will need to avoidbright sunlight; wear wrap-around sunglassesfor a short time; and avoid straining, lifting, orbending. Cataract surgery today offers a safeand effective treatment to maintain independ-ence and improve quality of life for olderadults.Sensory Impairments 455 Glaucoma Glaucoma is a group of degenerative eye dis- eases in which the optic nerve is damaged byhigh intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting in blindness due to nerve atrophy (Podolsky, 1998).Glaucoma is a leading cause of visual impair-ment, responsible for 10%-20% of all blindnessin the United States, and occurs more often inthose over 40, with an increased incidence withage (3% to 4% in those over age 70) (Malone,Fletcher, & Plank, 2000; Podolsky, 1998). Unlike cataracts, there are some ethnic dis- tinctions with the development of glaucoma.Blacks tend to develop it earlier than whites, andfemales more often than males. Glaucoma ismore common in African Americans, AsianAmericans, and Eskimos. Other contributingfactors include eye trauma, small cornea, smallanterior chamber, family history, cataracts, andsome medications (Eliopoulos, 2005; Malone,Fletcher, & Plank, 2000). Although the cause is unknown, glaucoma results from pupillary blockage that limits flowof aqueous humor, causing a rise in intraocularpressure (IOP). Two major types are noted here:acute and chronic. Acute glaucoma is also calledclosed angle or narrow angle. Signs and symp-toms include severe eye pain in one eye, blurredvision, seeing colored halos around lights, redeye, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Symptomsmay be associated with emotional stress. Chronic glaucoma, also called open angle or primary open angle, is more common than acute(90% of cases are this type), affecting over 2 mil-lion people in the United States. This type ofglaucoma occurs gradually. Peripheral vision isslowly impaired. Signs and symptoms includetired eyes, headaches, misty vision, seeing halosaround lights, and worse symptoms in the morn-28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 455 456 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions ing. Glaucoma often involves one eye, but mayoccur in both. Early detection and treatment are essential in preventing loss of vision, because once vision hasbeen lost to glaucoma, it cannot be restored.Diagnosis is made using a tonometer to measure IOP . Normal IOP is 10-21 mm Hg. Ophthal-moscopic examination will reveal changes in thecolor and contour of the optic nerve when glau-coma is present. Gonioscopy (direct exam) pro- vides another means of evaluation. Treatment is aimed at reducing IOP . Medi- cations to decrease pressure may be given, andsurgical iridectomy to lower the IOP may preventfuture episodes of acute glaucoma. In chronicglaucoma, there is no cure, so treatment is aimedat managing IOP through medication and eye-drops. Nurses should monitor patients forresponse to medications and to verify that eye-drops are being taken regularly and properly. Inaddition, older adults should be assessed for safetyrelated to visual changes and also reminded tokeep regular visits with their eye doctor.Macular Degeneration Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD ) is the most common cause of blindness for thoseover age 60, affecting about 12 million Americansover the age of 40 and more than 1 out of every 3people over age 75 (Seftel, 2005; Starr, Guyer, &Yannuzzi, 1998). Risk factors for this sensoryproblem include high cholesterol, hypertension,diabetes, smoking, overexposure to ultravioletlight, and heredity. Macular degeneration resultsfrom damage or breakdown of the macula andsubsequent loss of central vision. Generally asso-ciated with the aging process, it can also resultfrom injury or infection. Two types are noted: dry(nonexudative) and wet (exudative). Dry maculardegeneration affects 90% of those with the disease(Lighthouse International, 2005) and has a betterprognosis. The dry type progresses slowly withmore subtle changes in vision than the wet type,which comes on suddenly and may cause moresevere loss in vision. The signs and symptoms ofARMD are decreased central vision, seeing imagesas distorted, decreased color vision, and sometimesa central scotoma (a large, dark spot in the centerof vision). Although there is no cure for macular degen- eration, some new therapies show promise ( Case Study 11-7 ). Photodynamic therapy uses a special laser to seal leaking blood vessels in the eye.Antioxidant vitamins (C, D, E, and beta-carotene)and zinc also seem to slow the progress of the dis-ease (Age-Related Eye Disease Study Authors[AREDS], 2001). Retinal cell transplantation orregeneration works by harvesting cells from thebody and injecting them into diseased macularsites in the hope that new and healthy cells willgrow, thus reversing the damage caused byARMD (Mascular Degeneration Foundation,2005). 11-13 Cataracts. 4:21 PM Page 456 Sensory Impairments 457 Chances are that most gerontological nurses will care for older adults with ARMD. Initi-ally, small changes in the environment shouldbe encouraged, such as better lighting in hall-ways, minimizing glare from lamps or shinyfloors, and decorating living spaces in con-trasting colors (McGrory & Remington, 2004).Visual adaptive devices such as magnifyingglasses and reading lamps may provide tempo-rary help as vision worsens. Auditory devicessuch as books on tape and adaptation of theenvironment to the visual impairment mayhelp maintain independence. Nurses should beaware of the treatments being researched andcan assure patients that although there is nocure at present, there is hope for the future. Inaddition, nurses should teach the elderly thatthe modification of any controllable risk fac-tors, such as smoking cessation, can decreaserisk of developing ARMD. Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blind-ness among older adults, resulting from break-age of tiny vessels in the retina as a complicationof diabetes. It generally affects both eyes. Thelonger a person has diabetes, the more likelythey are to suffer visual impairment (EyecareAmerica, 2005). Early diagnosis and treatmentcan prevent much of the blindness that occursfrom this disorder. There are four stages of diabetic retinopathy. These appear in Table 11-28 . Of the four stages, proliferative retinopathy is the most severe. Asnew fragile and abnormal blood vessels grow tocompensate for the blocked vessels in the retina,these vessels may leak blood into the eye, caus-ing swelling of the macula and blurred vision.This is what causes much of the blindness seenwith diabetic retinopathy.Box 11-6 Resources for Those with Visual Impairments American Academy of OphthalmologyP .O.

The first three stages of diabeticretinopathy are not treated. If a person com-plains of seeing spots floating in the visual field,bleeding may be occurring and the personshould see an eye doctor as soon as possible. Proliferative retinopathy is treated using a procedure called scatter laser treatment that helps shrink the abnormal vessels. This proce-dure may require at least two visits, because2.

For more severe cases of bleeding in the eye, a vitrectomy may be needed. When blood col- lects in the center of the eye, a vitrectomy allowsremoval of the vitreous gel that has blood in itthrough a small incision in the eye. The blood-contaminated vitreous gel is replaced with asaline-type solution. This is often done as anoutpatient procedure. The patient will need towear an eye patch for days to weeks and usemedicated eyedrops to prevent infection. Aftera vitrectomy, the person's eye may be red andsensitive for some time. The most important nursing consideration in caring for older persons who may be at risk fordiabetic retinopathy is to emphasize preventionof this complication. Treatment becomes neces-sary with more severe cases, so the best treat-ment is prevention through regular eye exams,good control of blood sugars, monitoring hyper-tension, and controlling cholesterol levels. Thenurse should encourage the older adult withdiabetes to develop a good working relationshipwith a trusted eye care professional. Retinal Detachment Although not as common as the other visualproblems discussed, retinal detachment may occur in the older adult. It can be the result oftrauma to the eye. Symptoms may be gradualor sudden and may look like spots movingacross the eye, blurred vision, light flashes, or acurtain drawing. If an older person presentswith such symptoms, seek immediate medicalhelp. Keep the person quiet to minimize fur-ther detachment. Surgery may be required tosave vision. Corneal Ulcer Corneal ulcers are more common in the elderly due to decreased tearing that occurs with normalaging. The ulcers may result from inflammationof the cornea related to stroke, fever, irritation,or a poor diet. Corneal ulcers are difficult to treatand may leave scars that affect vision. Signs ofcorneal ulcer may include bloodshot eye, photo-phobia, and complaint of irritation. The nurseshould encourage the older person to seekprompt assistance from an eye care professional. Chronic Sinusitis Consistently one of the top 10 chronic com-plaints of the elderly is chronic sinusitis(Eliopoulos, 2005). Over 15% of older personsreport having this condition (Stotts & Deitrich,2004). This results from irritants blockingdrainage of the sinus cavities, leading to infec-tion. When symptoms continue over a period ofweeks and up to 3 months and are often recur-ring, chronic sinusitis should be suspected.Symptoms include a severe cold, sneezing,cough (that is often worse at night), hoarseness,diminished sense of smell, discolored nasal dis-charge, postnasal drip, headache, facial pain,fatigue, malaise, and fever (Kelley, 2002). Uponphysical examination, the person may complainof pain on palpation of the sinus areas, andedema and redness of the nasal mucosa may beevident. Allergies, common cold, and dentalproblems should be ruled out for differentialdiagnosis. A CT scan of the sinuses will showareas of inflammation. Treatment for chronic sinusitis antibi- otics, decongestants, and reduce28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 459 460 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions swelling and ease breathing. Irrigation withover-the-counter normal saline nose spray isoften helpful and may be done 2-3 times perday. The person with chronic sinusitis shoulddrink plenty of fluids to maintain adequatehydration and avoid any environmental pollu-tants such as cigarette smoke or other toxins.Chronic sinusitis is a condition that many olderadults wrestle with their entire lives. Avoidanceof precipitating factors for each individualshould be encouraged. Integumentary Problems Many changes occur in the integumentary sys-tem with normal aging. These are discussed inChapter 6. One of the most common problemsin the elderly is a skin breakdown due to pres-sure ulcers. The treatment of pressure ulcers isdiscussed at length in Chapter 12. Skin cancerand herpes zoster infection (shingles) are alsocommon ailments. These disorders will bebriefly addressed here. Skin Cancers There are three major types of skin cancer: basalcell, squamous cell, and malignant melanoma(MM). The major risk factor for all types of skincancer is sun exposure. Basal cell carcinoma ( Figure 11-14 ) is the most common skin cancer, accounting for 65%-85% ofcases (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank, 2000).It is often found on the head or face, or other areasexposed to the sun. When treated early, it is easilyremoved through surgery and not life threatening,though it is often recurring. Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in African Americans and is also less serious thanmalignant melanoma. More than 51,000 newMM cases are reported annually to the AmericanCancer Society (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2005).Surgical treatment is required in malignantmelanoma ( Figure 11-15 ), with chemotherapy and radiation. The prognosis for MM depends onthe extent and staging of the tumor, but whenFigure 11-14 Basal cell carcinoma. Figure 11-15 Malignant melanoma.

The best treatment for skin cancer in the elderly is prevention. All older persons, especiallythose with fair skin who are prone to sunburn,should wear sunblock and protective clothing.Annual physical examinations should includeinspection of the skin for lesions. Older adultsshould be taught to report any suspicious areas ontheir skin to the physician. Persons should partic-ularly look for changes in shape, color, andwhether a lesion is raised or bleeds. Most skin can-cers, when treated early, have a good prognosis.Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Commonly known as shingles, herpes zoster is the same virus that causes chicken pox ( Case Study 11-8 ). Older persons may be infected with this latent varicella virus after initial exposureto it in the form of chicken pox. The virus thenlays dormant in the neurons until it is reacti-vated, often due to immunosuppression, whenit appears in the form of painful vesicles alongthe sensory nerves. Herpes zoster occurs in bothmen and women equally, with no specific ethnicvariations, but is more common in the elderly. 3. Why is there so much pain with this problem?

Case Study 11-828438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 461 462 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions Risk factors for developing shingles are age over 55 years, stress, and a suppressed immune system.For many older women particularly, emotional orpsychological stress can trigger reactivations.Contrary to the beliefs of some, the virus can recur. Signs and symptoms of herpes zoster include painful lesions that erupt on the sensory nervepath, usually beginning on the chest or face.These weepy vesicles get pustular and crusty overseveral days, with healing occurring in 2-4weeks (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank,2000). Diagnosis can be made by clinical appear-ance of the lesions and a history of onset. A scrap-ing will confirm some type of herpes virus. Themost common complaint of those with herpeszoster is pain that usually subsides in 3-5 weeks(NINDS, 2005). Postherpetic neuralgia may last6-12 months after the lesions disappear. Anitviral medications such as acyclovir are used to treat shingles. Topical ointments mayhelp with pain and itching. Pain medications,particularly acetaminophen, are appropriate forpain management in older adults. Persons withpain that lasts past 6 weeks after the skin lesionsare gone and that is described as sharp, burning,or constant require reevaluation by a physician.Postherpetic neuralgia usually disappears withina year (NINDS, 2005). Nursing interventions for the older adult with shingles are largely to recommend rest andcomfort. The patient should be advised that thevirus will run its course, but the person is con-tagious while vesicles are weepy. Persons shouldnot have direct contact (even clothing) withpregnant women, people who have not hadchicken pox, other elderly persons, or those withsuppressed immune systems. The older personwith shingles may experience concerns withpain management and feel a sense of isolation,particularly if they live alone. Arranging for afamily member or friend who does not have ahigh risk of infection to check on the older per-son at home is advisable. Endocrine/Metabolic Disorders Two of the most common disorders in this cat-egory among older adults are diabetes andhypothyroidism. These will be discussed in thissection. Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disorder in whichthe body does not make enough insulin, or can-not effectively use the little insulin that it doesproduce. There are two major types of diabetes:Type 1 (insulin dependent or IDDM) and Type2 (non-insulin dependent or NIDDM). Type 1generally occurs in children and used to beknown as juvenile onset diabetes. It is character-ized by hyperglycemia and little or no insulinproduction. Type 2 is seen in the vast majority ofthose with diabetes and is managed more oftenby diet, exercise, and oral medications. Type 2is most common in those over 30 and is charac-terized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. DM is the seventh leading cause of death among older adults. The risk of diabetesincreases with age, as does mortality from thisdisease. Risk factors include family history, obe-sity, race (African Americans, Hispanics, NativeAmericans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders),age over 45, hypertension (greater than or equalto 140/90), less \"good\" cholesterol (less than 35mg/dl), and a history of large babies (Maschak-Carey, Bourne, & Brown-Gordon, 2002). About 4.5 million women over the age of 60 have diabetes, but over 1 million of these women28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 462 Endocrine/Metabolic Disorders 463 do not know it. Type 2 is the most common typein older women (CDC, 2005). The risk of deathfrom DM is significantly higher among olderMexican American, African American, and NativeAmerican women when compared to whites. TheCenters for Disease Control (2005) name obesity,weight gain, and physical inactivity as the majorrisk factors for DM among women. Early diagnosis is difficult in the elderly, because they may not present with the typicalclassic symptoms of polydypsia, polyuria, andpolyphagia (Amella, 2004). Glucose intolerancemay be an initial sign in the elderly; however,diagnosis is made through lab tests and patienthistory. Due to the increased incidence with age,screening is recommended every 3 years with afasting blood sugar for those over 45 years of age. Management is successful when a balance is achieved among exercise, diet, and medications.Medications may be oral hypoglycemics orinsulin injection (needed in Type 1). Nurses willneed to do a significant amount of teaching(Tables 11-29 and 11-30 ) regarding the signs and symptoms of hyper- and hypoglycemia andthe role of medications in managing blood sugar. Although much of the teaching done with older adults is usually in the acute care hospitalor rehabilitation setting, telephone follow-upcalls have been shown to improve patient adher-ence to diet. Additionally, a significant findingof Kim and Oh's research was that patientsreceiving phone calls from the nurse aboutadherence to the prescribed regimen for diabetesmanagement showed an improved HbA1c overthose who did not have follow-up phone calls(2003). Thorough evaluation of readiness to learn and of the ability of an older person to manage his orher medications must be done. Older adults whoneed to give themselves insulin injections mayexperience anxiety about learning this task.Demonstration, repetition, and practice are goodtechniques for the older age group. Adaptivedevices such as magnifiers may help if the syringesare hard to read. A family member should also betaught to give the insulin to provide support andencouragement, although the older adult shouldbe encouraged to remain independent in this skillif possible. Williams and Bond's research sug-gested that programs that promote confidence inself-care abilities are likely to be effective for thosewith diabetes (2002). A plan for times of sicknessand the use of a glucometer to monitor blood sug-ars will also need to be addressed. Additionally, Table 11-29 The National Diabetes Education Program's Seven Principles for Management Principle 1: Find out what type of diabetes you have. Principle 2: Get regular care for your diabetes. Principle 3: Learn how to control your diabetes. Principle 4: Treat high blood sugar. Principle 5: Monitor your blood sugar level. Principle 6: Prevent and diagnose long-term diabetes problems. Principle 7: Get checked for long-term problems and treat them.

Many patients benefit from weight loss,so the nutritionist can assist with dietary planningin this regard also. Due to the increased risk of infection and slow healing that result from diabetes, foot care is anessential component in teaching older adults tomanage DM. Some experts believe that good pre-ventive foot care would significantly reduce theincidence of amputation in the elderly. Older per-sons with DM should never go barefoot outside.Extremes in temperature should be avoided.Shoes should be well fitting and not rub. Socksshould be changed regularly. Elders should betaught to inspect their feet daily, with a mirrorif needed. Corns and ingrown toenails should beinspected and treated by the doctor, not thepatient. Older persons should see their physicianfor a foot inspection at least yearly. Patientsshould be cautioned that even the smallest footinjury such as a thorn or blister can go unnoticedand unfelt\u2014and often results in partial amputa-tions that lead to a cascade of lower extremityproblems. Complications from DM are many. The most commonly seen in older adults are heart disease,stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, and visualproblems. A key to successful long-term man-agement of diabetes in older adults is preventionof complications. This is best achieved by a care-ful balance of diet, exercise, and medication.Oral hypoglycemics or insulin help to keepblood sugar under control. The best measure ofgood blood glucose management and controlledblood sugars is HgbA1c levels (glycosylatedhemoglobin). This measure of hemoglobin pro-vides insight into the overall maintenance ofacceptable blood sugar levels. If HgbA1c is ele-vated, it indicates that the blood sugar has beenhigh over time. Treatment is aimed at helpingpatients to maintain a normal level to decreaserisk of complications. There is some controversythat HgbA1c may not be reliable in the elderly.However, Watts et al. (2001) found that HgbA1cwas a predictor of foot amputation in patientswith diabetes. Most of the complications of DM seen in the elderly have been discussed elsewhere in thischapter. These include MI, stroke, ESRD, dia-betic retinopathy, and PVD. Peripheral neuropa-thy seen so commonly in older persons withdiabetes is most often the result of PVD. Per-ipheral neuropathy presents as uncomfortable,painful sensations in the legs and feet that are dif-ficult to treat. A lack of sensation may also bepresent and contribute to the risk of falls. Thereis no cure for peripheral neuropathy, and it tendsto be a complication that patients struggle withcontinually. A combination of medication toaddress pain and interventions by a physical ther-apist seem to be the best current treatment.Table 11-30 Key Areas for Nursing Teaching of Older Persons with Diabetes Proper nutritionExerciseMedicationsSigns and symptoms of hyper- and hypoglycemia Meaning of lab tests: FBS, blood glucose, HgbA1c Use of a glucometerFoot careImportance of adherence to therapeutic regimenPossible long-term complicationsPrevention of complications Plan when sick28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 464 Other Disorders or Syndromes 465 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism results from lack of sufficientthyroid hormone being produced by the thyroidgland. Older adults may have subclinicalhypothyroidism, in which the TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is elevated and the T4(thyroxine or thyroid hormone) is normal. Inthis condition, the body is trying to stimulateproduction of more thyroid hormone. Someolder adults with this condition will progress tohave primary or overt hypothyroidism. This iswhen the TSH is elevated and T4 is decreased.Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause(American Association of Clinical Endocrinolo-gists, 2005), though certain pituitary disorders,medications, and other hormonal imbalancesmay be causal factors. Older adults may present an atypical picture, but the most common presenting complaintsare fatigue and weakness. Table 11-31 provides additional classic signs and symptoms. Diag-nosis should include a thorough history andphysical; atrial fibrillation and heart failure areoften associated factors. Lab tests should includethyroid and thyroid antibody levels (common toHashimoto's), and lipids, because hyperlipi-demia is also associated with this disorder. Treatment centers on returning the thyroid hormone level to normal. This is done throughoral thyroid replacement medication, usuallythyroxine. Whenever a patient is started on thismedication, checks should be done at 3, 6, and12 months to monitor effectiveness and bloodlevels, because hyperthyroidism is a side effect of this therapy and can have serious implicationson the older person's health. Nurses should teach patients about the importance of taking thyroid medication at thesame time each day without missing doses.Sometimes older adults have other problems associated with hypothyroidism such as boweldysfunction and depression. Any signs of com-plicating factors should be reported to thephysician, and doctors' appointments for mon-itoring should be religiously kept. Strategies formanaging fatigue and weakness should also beaddressed, because some lifestyle modificationsmay need to be made as treatment is initiated. Other Disorders or Syndromes There are several notable conditions commonlyseen in older adults that may be the result of avariety of factors, not just one physical problem ordisease. These include depression, anxiety, delir-ium, dementia, and insomnia. Depression, anxi-ety, and insomnia are all discussed at length inTable 11-31 and *Primary signs in the elderly; others may or not be presentSource: AACE, 4:21 PM Page 465 466 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions Table 11-33 Potential Causes of Delirium Fluid and electrolyte imbalancesInfectionCHFCertain polypharmacyPainImpaired cardiac or functionEmotional HypoxiaChapter 12. Dementia of the Alzheimer's type wasaddressed earlier in this chapter. Delirium andSundowner's syndrome will be discussed here. Delirium Delirium, also called acute confusion, is fre- quently seen in older adults. It occurs in22%-38% of older patients in the hospital andin as much as 40% of long-term care residents(Kurlowicz, 2002). Diagnosis is missed in thevast majority of case (Waszynski, 2001). De-lirium should be addressed in the elderly, as itis associated with increased length of stay in thehospital and higher mortality rates. This condition has several distinguishing traits, but especially cognitive-perceptual diffi-culties and altered level of consciousness. Othercharacteristics of delirium appear in Table 11-32 . Delirium is a temporary, reversible condition thatmay have many different causes, including thoselisted in Table 11-33 . Persons' lucidity and con- fusion may fluctuate hourly but worsen at night.A short attention span, disorganized thinking,and disturbed sleep patterns are also common. The symptoms of delirium are disorientation to time and place, altered attention, impairedmemory, mood swings, poor judgment, alteredlevel of consciousness, and a decreased Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A score of 23 (out of 30) or less on the MMSE indi-cates cognitive disturbance. All possible causesshould be considered. Delirium symptoms tendto have a sudden onset, but may be associatedwith any of the causes listed in Table 11-32. Thesubtypes of delirium are hyperactive, hypoactive,and mixed, indicating that a variety of behaviorsmay be seen within delirium, from increasedactivity to lethargy or a combination of both. Delirium can be detected promptly by a good history and physical examination. MMSEsand geriatric depression screenings are goodtools to assist with diagnosis. Lab tests such as acomplete blood count, electrolytes, liver andrenal function tests, serum calcium and glucose,urinalysis, chest x-rays, ECG, and oxygen satu-Table 11-32 Characteristics of Delirium in the Elderly Abrupt onsetTime limited\u2014generally no longer than 1 month duration Often associated with a change in environment or unfamiliar surroundings Often associated with an acute illnessAltered level of consciousnessFluctuates during the dayDisturbed span; or incoherent 6/7/06 PM Page 466 Other Disorders or Syndromes 467 vided during waking hours. In addition, duringthe period of delirium, care should be taken toavoid complications, such as the hazards ofimmobility. Medications that contribute to the problem should be discontinued or decreased to minimaldoses. Low-dose neuroleptics such as haloperi-dol (Haldol) have been traditionally used totreat delirium, but they have a significant riskfor serious side effects. Newer antipsychoticssuch as risperidone have a lower incidence ofside effects and may be a better alternative toHaldol. Other antipsychotics such as chlorpro-mazine (Thorazine) or thioridazine (Mellaril)should be avoided due to potential cardiac sideeffects (Reuben et al., 2004). Generally, delirium should be short in dura- tion, resolving with treatment in a month orless. Early detection and treatment can assist inpreventing complications that are often associ-ated with this condition. Sundowner's Syndrome Also referred to as sundowning, sundowner's syn-drome refers to behavior problems that are some-times seen, particularly in person's withdementia, in the late afternoon or early eveningwhen the sun sets. This behavior may includedisorientation, emotional upset, or confusion.There is no exact explanation as to why thisoccurs in some older persons, but ideas includethe lack of light that contributes to disorientationwith their surroundings, boredom at that time ofday, or stress (Alzheimer's Association, 2005). Some suggestions for minimizing the occur- rence of this syndrome include keeping the per-son busy and active during the day to avoidnapping so that normal sleep patterns will bemaintained. Brisk walks and increased exerciseduring the day may minimize wandering orwalking behaviors at night. Keeping the lightsration will all help determine the underlyingcause (Reuben et al., 2004). Resnick (2005)advises nurses to first check for medical causesof delirium such as infection, medications, orchange in oxygenation. The stress of hospitalization may add to the risk of delirium in older adults. Other risk fac-tors for delirium include dementia, advancedage, sleep deprivation, immobility, dehydration,and sensory impairment (Reuben et al., 2004).Kurlowicz (2002) lists common causes inelderly hospitalized patients as medication,pain, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, andinfection. Treatment of delirium depends on the cause. Symptoms of delirium should not be acceptedas normal nor dismissed as a part of old age.Interventions to treat the causal factor should beimplemented. For example, if the person isfound to have a urinary tract infection, it shouldbe actively treated. If numerous medicationsmay be to blame, the medication regimen mustbe re-examined. If the person has hypoxia,improved oxygenation is the remedy. To manage the symptoms of delirium such as confusion, disorientation, and lack of attentionwhile the cause is being addressed, nursesshould initiate several measures. First, the per-son must be kept safe from harm when con-fused. Having a family member stay at thebedside with the person may be helpful.Reorientation to surroundings, person, time,and place should be consistent and reinforced byall team members. Adequate hydration andnutrition are essential to maintain electrolytebalances. Familiar items such as pictures,favorite blankets, or clothing should be pro-vided for comfort. The environment should beconducive to sleep, and interruptions limited.Cognitively stimulating activities such as rem-iniscence, word games, or cards should be pro-28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 467 468 Chapter 11: Management of Common Illnesses, Diseases, and Health Conditions Critical Thinking Exercises 1. This chapter discusses a great deal of content. Choose one health condition or dis- ease that interests you most and search the Internet site of the organization dedicatedto that cause. What resources are available for persons with this problem? 2. Volunteer through your local hospital to help with stroke and/or blood pressure screenings of older adults. Note any common risk factors you observe among the per-sons that are being screened. 3. Visit a support group related to one of the long-term conditions discussed in this chap- ter. It might be a stroke survivor's meeting, the breather's club, or the Parkinson's dis-ease group. Listen to the participants and their family members. Write down anythingnew you learned about how people live and manage with this condition. Talk person-ally with a family who is living with the condition that you are further investigating. 4. Go to your local mall, church, shopping center, restaurant, or other place where se- niors living in the community might gather. Listen to casual conversations betweenolder adults. What types of health problems and concerns do they express? 5. Talk to a nurse who works in the emergency room, or to a local cardiologist. Ask what symptoms they have seen in older adult patients who were diagnosed with myocardialinfarction. How are these symptoms different from or similar to a classic presentation?on in the room to minimize confusion as the sunsets until bedtime is thought helpful by some.Make bedtime a quiet and stress-free experienceby eliminating excess noise and providing a rou-tine such as snack and television or reading.Maintaining a calm and pleasant environmentwhile continually reorienting those affected bysundowner's syndrome may minimize the emo-tional stress experienced by these older persons.Additionally, discuss the possibility of sleepingmedications for those who are continually rest-less at night. Whatever strategies are used tomanage behaviors associated with sundowning,the nurse and caregivers should remain calm,reassuring, and flexible while maintaining a safeenvironment for the older adult.28438_CH11_389_474.qxd 6/7/06 4:21 PM Page 468 Glossary 469 Personal Reflection 1.

Differentiating disease from normalchanges with aging and the early recognition ofindicators of underlying health problems allowthe early initiation of treatment while recovery isstill possible (Amella, 2004). The professionalnurse's ability to successfully identify, evaluate,and treat the chronic conditions that hallmarkimpending illness or impair function is essentialto promoting the quantity and quality of life. Inthis chapter, we will present the diagnoses andtreatments of multifactorial conditions that mayindicate the onset of illness or result in a declinein functioning, including falls, delirium and con-fusion, anxiety, depression, urinary incontinence,sleep disorders, pressure ulcers, and dysphagia.Also, we will pay special attention to the problemof polypharmacy, a key causative and contributoryfactor for many common health problems. Polypharmacy Older adults take considerably more medica-tions than younger people. Despite the fact thatolder adults constitute only 12.7% of the U.S.population, they consume 34% of all prescrip-tion medications and 40% of all nonprescriptionmedications (American Society of ConsultantPharmacists, 2000). It is estimated that olderadults living outside skilled nursing facilitiestake an average of four to five medications perday; those who are institutionalized average sixto eight medications per day (McCrea, Ranelli,& Boyce, 1993). The act of taking many med-ications concurrently is termed polypharmacy . The American Nurses Association Position Statement (1990) defines polypharmacy as the \"concurrent use of several drugs.\"Implications of Polypharmacy The consequences of polypharmacy in the olderadult range from mildly annoying to life threat-ening. Multiple medication regimens are oftenperceived as complicated and expensive, result-ing in nonadherence to the prescribed therapy. Nonadherence is defined as the extent to whichpatients are not willing to follow the instruc-tions they are given for prescribed treatments.Additionally, other age-related disabilities mayhamper adherence, such as visual/hearing im-pairments, impaired memory or cognition, orarthritis. Polypharmacy and older age are thetwo most significant predictors of nonadherence(Bedell, Cohen, & Sullivan, 2000). In addition to nonadherence, polypharmacy may result in a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) . An ADR is a detri- mental response to a given medication that isundesired, unintended, or unexpected in rec-ommended doses. More than one third of ADRsinvolve older persons, and an estimated 95% ofthose are predictable and preventable (AmericanSociety of Consultant Pharmacists, 2000). Oncean ADR occurs in an older person, a higher levelof care is usually required to treat the adverseevent. ADRs have been shown to increase therisk of mortality and nursing home placementin the geriatric population. Clinical manifesta-tions of ADRs may include varying degrees ofnausea, constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, Box 12-1 Any symptom in the older adult should be considered an ADR until proven other-wise (Avorn & Gurwitz, 1997).28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems urinary incontinence, muscle aches, sexual dys-function, insomnia, confusion, dizziness, ortho-static hypotension, and falls (Golden, Silverman,& Preston, 2000). There is an increased incidence of drug- drug interactions in a patient experiencing polypharmacy. A drug-drug interaction mayoccur when two or more drugs are taken concur-rently. As the number of medications takenincreases, so does the risk for a drug-drug inter-action. For example, a patient receiving two dif-ferent medications has approximately a 6% chanceof experiencing an interaction. A patient takingfive medications has a 50% chance of an interac-tion. Finally, this chance rises to nearly 100% if heor she is taking eight medications (Jones, 1997).As with ADRs, more care is usually required totreat these drug-drug interactions in the elderly. An elderly person experiencing polyphar- macy is more susceptible to medication errors , defined as taking the wrong medication or thewrong dose at the wrong time or for the wrongpurpose. The incidence of errors in medicationadministration is increasing\u2014deaths attributedto medication errors rose from 198,000 in 1995to 218,000 in 2000 (Ernst & Grizzle, 2001). Hospitalization as a consequence of polyphar- macy is more prevalent in older adults. Twenty-eight percent of hospitalizations of elderly are aresult of ADRs and nonadherence alone. Relatedcomplications that result in hospitalizationinclude electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinalbleeding, and hip fractures associated with falls.The older patient admitted to the hospital andtaking three or more medications for chronicconditions has a 33% chance of being readmit-ted within a month of discharge (AmericanSociety of Consultant Pharmacists, 2000). With the growing concern surrounding identification and prevention of polypharmacy,the nurse needs to be vigilant of the poten-tial underutilization of some drug therapies inthe older adult as well. A number of studieshave illustrated the hazards of underprescrib-ing medications, for instance, beta blockersafter acute myocardial infarction (Gottlieb,McCarter, Vogel, Landerman, & Hanlon, 1996), &Hickey, 1998). Gonin, and Hatfield(1994) demonstrated the amount of opioid anal-gesia administered to an older person in painwas consistently less than the amount given toyounger adults. Withholding therapy based onadvanced age may result in increased morbidityand mortality, and reduced quality of life.Unrelieved pain in the elderly can result indecreased cough, decreased gastrointestinalmotility, an increase in negative feelings, a pre-occupation with the pain, and a longer hospi-tal stay (McCaffery & Pasero, 1999). Polypharmacy-associated nonadherence, ADRs, drug-drug interactions, and increased inci-dence of hospitalizations undoubtedly con-tribute to increased health care costs, bothindirectly and directly. Indirect costs areincurred as a result of treating these conse-quences of polypharmacy. Direct costs stemfrom the patient literally spending more toobtain the medications. Health care costs ingeneral are rapidly on the rise. In particular, thesingle leading component of health care expen-diture is the cost of prescription drugs.Currently, prescription drugs account for 10%of total health care spending; they are projectedto account for 18% in 2008 (Ganguli, 2003).The AARP Public Policy Institute (2004)compared prescription drug prices commonlyused by the elderly population between 200028438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 478 Polypharmacy 479 and 2003 and found that the average annualrate of increase in manufacturer list price farexceeded the rate of general inflation duringthat same time frame. Even though Medicare covers virtually all adults aged 65 and older, its standard benefitpackage no longer pays for outpatient medica-tions. A variety of supplementary insuranceoptions are available to the elderly on an indi-vidual basis that may provide additional cov-erage of prescription medicine; however, evenwith these options, it is estimated that onethird of the beneficiaries have no prescriptiondrug coverage at all (Klein, Turvey, & Wallace,2004). This translates into many patients pay-ing hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket permonth for medications they literally cannot livewithout. Despite potentially severe conse-quences, some older adults are choosing toforego prescription medications recommendedto them. Mojtabai and Olfson (2003) foundthat in a 2-year period more than 2 million el-derly Medicare beneficiaries did not adhere todrug treatment regimens because of cost.Nonadherence with drug therapy tended to bemore common among beneficiaries with no orpartial medication coverage and was associatedwith poorer health and higher rates of hospi-talization. Clearly, the high cost of medicationsis taking its toll on the elderly.Risk Factors for Polypharmacy There are a number of reasons why the elderlyin particular are predisposed to polypharmacy.Older people often have a myriad of chroniccomorbidities (chronic illnesses) requiring med-ications. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes arejust two examples of illnesses that may requirea multidrug regimen. In addition, many elderlyhave their care provided by specialty physicianswho may be unaware of the medications pre-scribed by other health care providers. Oftenthere is little or no communication occurringbetween health care providers, and patients aregetting duplicate and unnecessary medications.There are also health care providers who simplywrite a prescription because that is what theprovider thinks the patient wants. It has beenestimated that 75% of all visits to a physi-cian result in a written prescription (Larson &Martin, 1999). At other times, a health careprovider may unwittingly get caught up in the\"prescribing cascade.\" For example, an elderlypatient taking codeine for moderate pain mayexperience constipation and nausea. If the pre-scriber adds a phenothiazine (an antiemetic) anda laxative, the patient may become excessivelysedated and experience loose stool that mayresult in fecal incontinence. Consequently, med-ications may be ordered to treat those symp-toms, and so on. Treating adverse drug reactionswith more medication will in turn potentiatethe possibility of yet more adverse reactions.Tamblyn, McCleod, Abrahamowicz, and Laprise(1996) report that adverse drug reactions aretreated with another drug in 80% of visits tothe physician. The consequences of polypharmacy in the elderly are complicated by age-related changes inthe body that result in altered pharmacokineticsBox 12-2 An AARP survey (2004) reported that 71% of older adults found paying forprescriptions to be problematic. For moreinformation on medication use in theelderly, see www.aarp.org/ppi/.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 479 480 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems and pharmacodynamics . Pharmacokinetics refers to the absorption, distribution, metabo-lism, and excretion of a given drug, or \"what thebody does to the drug.\" Pharmacodynamicsrefers to the biochemical or physiological inter-actions of drugs, or \"what the drug does to thebody.\" The physiological responses to medica-tions are often altered in the older person. Theresponses to some medications are exaggerated;however, the responses to other medications areoften suppressed. See Table 12-1 for a more detailed description of these age-related changesand their clinical significance. Recognizing that some medications should be avoided in the elderly because their potentialrisks outweigh their potential benefits, experts ingeriatric medicine and pharmacy have developedexplicit criteria for inappropriate drug use innursing home patients (Beers et al., 1991). Thesecriteria identify medications likely to create prob-lems in the elderly and were developed to predictwhen the potential for adverse outcomes isgreater than the potential for benefit. Beers(1997) updated the original criteria to includeelderly patients in all settings (outpatient, inpa-tient, and nursing homes). Medications withhigh potential for serious adverse outcomes in theelderly are many, and are described in Chapter 8.The nurse, primary care provider, and pharmacistshould refer to the list in Table 8-1 when consid-ering medication administration in the elderly. Interventions/Strategies for Care Nurses play a key role in effective drug therapy.There are a number of strategies the nurse canimplement to enhance medication adherence,minimize adverse consequences of polyphar-macy, and in turn improve patient outcomes. The nurse should be knowledgeable about drug therapy in the elderly andthe medicationsthe individual patient is taking. Becomingfamiliar with the medications that have beenidentified as problematic for the elderly is a goodstarting point. When medications are being ad-ministered that have a high potential for adversereactions, the nurse should be vigilant aboutmonitoring for adverse effects as well as evalu-ating the therapeutic effect. To obtain a comprehensive medication pro- file when gathering a history, in addition to ask-ing the name, purpose, dose, and administrationparameters for each medication taken, also askthe following: Do you use OTC medications, includ- ing vitamins, dietary supplements, orherbal preparations? How many alcoholic beverages do you drink a week? Do you ever borrow medications? How many health care providers are involved in your care? Do you request refills without seeing your health care provider? Do you have prescription medications from more than one health careprovider? Do you have prescriptions filled at more than one pharmacy? Do you have any vision or hearing problems? Monitor the patient's serum blood urea nitro- gen (BUN) and creatinine because the excretionof most drugs depends on adequately function-ing kidneys. However, keep in mind thatbecause lean body mass decreases with advanc-ing age, the serum creatinine level tends to over-estimate the older adult's ability to excrete aparticular medication. A excretion serum flowCreatinine clearance possiblydelayed increasing fortoxicityBecause creatinine is mass and muscle massdecreases with could infact renal impairment exists;urine creatinine clearance is abetter indicator of renal functionin the elderlyRisk for toxicity of highlyprotein-bound drugs due drug circulatingSlowed metabolism, increasinghalf-lifeLess 12: of Common Problems (CrCl). Creatinine clearance measures the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is thenumber of milliliters of filtrate made by thekidneys per & Pagana,2005). (1976) formulashould be used estimate creatinine clearancein older adults. (See Box 12-3 ). In comparing and contrasting serum creati- nine and CrCl, consider two men with a serumcreatinine of 1 mg per dl who both weigh 72 kg(158.4 lb). The first man is 25 years old and thesecond man is 85 years old. Even though theirserum creatinine is the same, their CrCl is sig-nificantly different. The younger man's esti-mated creatinine clearance is 115 ml per minute(1.92 ml per second), whereas the older man'swould be 55 ml per minute (0.92 ml per sec-ond). This difference is especially importantwith drugs that have a narrow therapeutic indexand significant renal excretion. In addition to monitoring renal function, the nurse should monitor the LFTs could result in a prolonged half-life of the medication because it is cleared veryslowly from the body. As a result, toxicity is apossible outcome of impaired liver metabolism. Maintain a high index of suspicion. When a patient acquires new symptoms, consider thepossibility of an ADR until proven otherwise.An alteration in thought processes or behavior(restlessness, irritability, and confusion) may bethe first sign of drug toxicity. Take measures to help simplify and stream- line a medication regimen. Use doses with oncedaily or twice daily dosing, because the less fre-quent the dosing, the higher the probability ofadherence. Avoid alternate day therapy whenpossible because this can be confusing to thepatient. Review regimens regularly and revise asneeded, based on patient compliance, satisfac-tion, and response to the regimen. Always consider nonpharmacologic ap- proaches (e.g., lifestyle modification) instead ofor in addition to drug treatment. For instance, Box 12-3 The Cockroft-Gault Formula for CrCL females.Box 12-4 POINT: Start low and go slow with new medications.When initiating pharmacological treat- ment for chronic or mild disorders in theelderly, the starting dose should be alower, effective dose. If after a predeter-mined amount of time this dose is notadequate to produce the desired effect,then the dose should be increased slowlyuntil the therapeutic effect is achieved.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 482 Polypharmacy 483 constipation can often be successfully managedwith diet and fluid intake rather than laxativesand stool softeners. There is a growing body ofevidence identifying effective behavioral inter-ventions to promote continence, safety, relax-ation, and sleep. Nonpharmacologic approachesto the treatment of the common health careproblems addressed in this chapter are identifiedand explained in each section. Ensure that the patient/caregiver is an in- formed consumer. Encourage the patient and/or caregiver to learn about the medications theyare taking. Advise them to ask questions andread package inserts so they will know thedesired therapeutic effects as well as potentialADRs, the correct way to take the medicationproperly, and potential drug-drug and drug-diet interactions. Suggest that they consider allnew medications as trial therapy until the pa-tient and the health care provider determinethat they work safely and are effective. Recog-nize that new symptoms may not be from oldage, but from the drugs being taken. Instruct the patient to obtain all medications (prescription and nonprescription) at one phar-macy so pharmacists can check for potentiallydangerous interactions. The pharmacist can serveas the central figure who maintains a list of med-ications and screens for drug-drug interactionsto avoid harmful situations. Encourage the pa-tient or caregiver to know the pharmacist on afirst-name basis! that should\"brown bag\" medications (including prescrip-tion and nonprescription medicines, vitamins,and herbal supplements) with every office visit,so the health care provider can review and doc-ument medications taken. Suggest the patientinvent a system to remember to take medica-tions. Use meals or bedtime as cues for remem-bering. Drug-taking routines should take intoaccount whether the medicine works better onan empty or a full stomach. Consider using pillboxes, schedules, and/or calendars. If there are no children or cognitively impaired individuals in the household, the nursemay suggest easy-to-open (nonchildproof) con-tainers. Nonchildproof lids must be requested.Encourage the older person to ask for large typelabels or to use a magnifying glass under abright light to read labels. Large print writteninstructions should also be requested whenneeded. Discourage pill sharing and pill hoard-ing. Medication cabinets should be checked atleast annually for outdated medications andmedications no longer needed. A home healthnurse, family member, or friend may be enlistedto assist the older person with this safety check. A number of strategies are available to help the patient stretch his or her prescription dollars.When a new prescription is ordered, suggest thepatient ask for free drug samples from the physi-cian. If the patient develops undesirable sideeffects from the medication and has to switch,he or she won't be stuck with a costly bottle ofmedicine. Encourage the patient to ask for a sen-ior citizen discount at the pharmacy. Genericequivalents and store or discount brand prod-ucts save money. Be sure the patient under-stands his or her current drug coverage. Healthbenefit information can be very confusing. Resources The passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug,Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003has recently changed prescription medicationaccessibility for the elderly. Beginning June2004 through 2005, a prescription discountcard has been made available to eligible benefi-ciaries. The card yields a potential average sav-ings of between 10% and 25% per prescription.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 483 484 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems In 2006, a full-scale drug benefit replaces theprescription discount card. It will allow benefi-ciaries to voluntarily sign up with a private planthat offers drug coverage, or sign up for a stand-alone drug benefit. This drug coverage will besubject to a monthly premium, estimated toaverage $35 in the first year. A $250 annualdeductible is also planned. Medicare will coverthree-quarters of the drug costs between $250and $2,250 until they reach $3,600 in out-of-pocket spending. Once this threshold is reached,Medicare will pay all costs except for nominalcost sharing of 5% (Klein et al., 2004). Thisplan is described on the government's Web siteat http://www.medicare.gov/medicarereform/108s1013.pdf. Another option for the elderly in financial need is to consider a medication assistance pro-gram (MAP). Typically sponsored by pharma-ceutical companies, a MAP provides a particularbrand of medication at little or no cost topatients who meet certain financial criteria anddo not have insurance coverage for prescriptiondrugs. Fifty-three percent of the top 200 med-ications prescribed in 1999 were offered throughMAPs to patients who qualified (Miller, 2002).Even though most MAPs require some physi-cian involvement in the application process,nurses can act as advocates to initiate the refer-ral. An Internet site that serves as a \"yellowpages\" for these MAPs is www.needymeds.com. In response to the high cost of prescription medications in this country, some people haveopted to obtain medications from mail orderpharmacies. These pharmacies may be out ofstate or outside the United States. Dependingon the prescription, medications can be boughtfor a fraction of the cost of purchasing them atthe local pharmacy. Critics argue that the lackof regulatory standards puts consumers at risk.At time of print, a bipartisan bill has been pro-posed that would legalize the safe importationof prescription drugs, beginning with Canada.The AARP states, \"though not a final solutionto the problem of high drug cost, the safeimportation of prescription drugs will help putdownward pressure on prices and help individ-uals secure a degree of savings.\" (2004, p. 3). The use of multiple drugs is indicated and appropriate for some medical conditions. How-ever, in the older adult, where it is most preva-lent, polypharmacy can cause more harm thangood. The nurse plays a key role in making surethe older adult gets the most from his or herdrug therapy. It is the nurse's responsibility to be knowledgeable about the medicationsadministered, to astutely assess the patient'sresponse to the drug therapy, and to educate thepatient about his or her medication regimen.Nursing intervention can prevent or minimizemany of the multiple complications of poly-pharmacy, such as falls. Falls A fallis defined as \"an event which results in a person unintentionally coming to rest on theground or another lower level; not as a result ofa major intrinsic event (such as a stroke) or over-whelming hazard\" (Tinetti, Speechley, & Ginter,1988, p. 1703). For millions of older Americans,falls present a serious health risk. More than onethird of adults ages 65 years and older fall eachyear (Hausdorff, 2001). Implications of Falls Falls can result in injury, loss of independence,reduced quality of life, and death in the elderly.Fractures are the most serious health conse-quence of falls. Of those who fall, 20%-30%28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 484 Falls 485 suffer moderate to severe injuries such as hipfractures or hip traumas. Eighty-seven percentof all fractures among older adults are due tofalls. The most common fractures are of the ver-tebrae, hip, forearm, leg, ankle, pelvis, upperarm, and hand (Scott, 1990). At least 50% ofelderly persons who were ambulatory beforefracturing a hip do not recover their prefracturelevel of mobility (Beers & Berkow, 2005). In addition to fractures, over 50% of falls among elderly persons result in at least someminor injury such as lacerations and bruises(Beers & Berkow, 2005). Quality of life maydeteriorate drastically after a fall. If the elderlyperson remains on the floor for a time after a fall,dehydration, pressure sores, rhabdomyolysis,hypothermia, and pneumonia may result.Elderly persons who fall, particularly those whofall repeatedly, tend to have deficits in activitiesof daily living and are at high risk of subsequenthospitalization, further disability, institutional-ization, and death. Fall-related injuries accountfor about 5% of hospitalizations in patients 65years of age or older. About 5% of elderly per-sons with hip fractures die while hospitalized;overall mortality in the 12 months after a hipfracture ranges from 12% to 67% (Beers &Berkow, 2005). In 2001, more than 11,600 peo-ple age 65 and older died from fall-relatedinjuries (Senior Falls Toolkit, 2005). The totalcost of all fall injuries for people age 65 or olderin 1994 was $27.3 billion. By 2020, the cost offall injuries is expected to reach $43.8 billion(Englander, Hodson, & Terregrossa, 1996). Falls that do not result in injury may still have serious consequences. Elderly persons mayfear falling again, which can lead to reducedmobility. This reduced mobility can lead todecreased activity, decreased independence, andan increased dependence on others. In addition,decreased activity can increase joint stiffness andweakness, further compromising mobility. Fallsare reported to be a contributing factor in 40%of nursing home admissions (Beers & Berkow,2005). Risk Factors for Falls Nurses routinely assess patients and their envi-ronment and are instrumental in implementinginterventions to prevent falls. In order to accu-rately assess risk for falls, a comprehensiveknowledge of factors that contribute to a fall isessential. Risk factors for falls can be categorizedinto intrinsic andextrinsic factors . Intrinsic factors relate to the changes associated withaging and with disorders of physical functionsneeded to maintain balance. These functionsinclude vestibular, proprioceptive, and visualfunction, as well ( see Table 12-2 ). Elderly per- sons who fall in institutions are usually morephysically and/or cognitively impaired, andtherefore intrinsic factors contribute most tofalls and fall-related injuries. In institutional-ized patients, the use of restraints and bed railsmay increase the risk of falls because patientsattempt to free themselves from these con-straints. Extrinsic factors are related to environ-mental hazards and challenges such as poorlighting, stairs, clutter, and throw rugs. Extrin-Box 12-5 In 2001, more than 1.6 million seniors were treated in emergency departmentsfor fall-related injuries and nearly 388,000were hospitalized (Senior Falls Toolkit,2005).28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 485 486 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems sic factors are implicated in up to 50% of allfalls in the elderly in community settings (Beers& Berkow, 2005). Among the elderly living in the community, most falls occur during usual activities such aswalking. Indoor falls occur most often in thebathroom, bedroom, and kitchen. About 10%of falls occur on stairs, with descent being morehazardous than ascent. The first and last stepsare the most dangerous. Common sites of out-door falls are curbs and steps. In institutions, themost common sites of falls are the bedside (dur-ing transfers into or out of bed) and the bath-room (Beers & Berkow, 2005). The use of drugsis a major risk factor for falls; the risk of fallingincreases with the number of prescribed drugs.Psychoactive drugs are the drugs most com-monly reported as increasing the risk of falls andhip fractures. Other medications that contributeto falls diuretics, aminoglycosides,and phenothiazines (Beers & Berkow, 2005). Fall Assessment Elderly persons admitted to acute care, rehabil-itation, or long-term care settings should havean initial fall risk assessment on admission andat regular intervals throughout their stay. Thereare a number of fall assessment tools available toassess inpatient risk of falls, but no single toolhas been adopted universally. Most tools containa fall history, an examination of mental andmobility status, a checklist for the presence ofsensory deficits, a list of medications the clientis receiving, and a list of primary and secondarydiagnoses. A fall assessment tool is depicted inFigure 12-1 . To be effective, a fall assessment tool must be short, individualized to the patient,applicable to the setting, readily available to thestaff, and have demonstrated validity and relia-bility. Most important, it must also be followedby individualized interventions to prevent fallsspecific to the patient. Fall prevention strategiesare likely to be more effective if they include amultidisciplinary approach to the process. In the community setting, elderly patients with known risk for falling should be ques-tioned about falls as part of all their routinescreenings. This is necessary because manyelderly persons fear being institutionalized andare unlikely to voluntarily admit falling unlessthey have sustained an injury for which theyneed medical care. A fall may be an isolatedevent or recurrent. A recurrent fall is defined as more than two falls in a 6-month period(Fuller, 2000). All falls should be carefully eval-uated for the underlying cause, but the inci-dence of recurrent falls is a significant risk factorfor serious injury. The person should be asked todescribe the circumstances surrounding the fall,such as what activity they were engaged in, thelocation of the fall, witnesses to the fall, andTable 12-2 Risk Factors for Falls Intrinsic Factors Extrinsic FactorsCognitive impairment Poor lightingMedication/alcohol Poor color distinctionImpaired mobility ClutteredFall history environmentAcute or chronic Unfamiliar illness environment Elimination problems StairsSensory defects Throw rugsFrailty Unsuitable footwearPostural hypotension Restraints Siderails28438_CH12_475_560.qxd PM Page 486 Falls Figure 12-1 Morse Fall Scale.

The nurse should perform aphysical assessment to determine the cause andcontributing factors ( see Table 12-3 ). A home visit is important in identifying extrinsic risk factors and planning and imple-menting appropriate interventions. Home eval-uations may be part of discharge planning froman institution or conducted during home healthvisits. A home safety checklist should be used toensure a thorough evaluation. Important com-ponents of a home evaluation are outlined inFigure 12-2 . Interventions/Strategies for Fall Prevention Not all falls can be prevented, but by identify-ing risk factors and implementing appropriateinterventions nurses can play a vital role in pre-venting falls or minimizing injury. There are anumber of strategies for creating a milieu thatreduces the risk of falls. Some of the more suc-cessful strategies follow. Modify the EnvironmentIn the inpatient setting, orientation to the envi-ronment with an emphasis on safety devices isthe first step in preventing falls. Other strate-gies include nonskid slippers or shoes, removalof obstacles and clutter, having the commodeclose to the bed, having the call light withineasy access, and encouraging use of glasses andhearing aids. The avoidance of physical re-straints, such as raised side rails, and maintain-ing the bed in the lowest position are essentialin reducing the severity of falls. Side rails are acommon physical restraint that are used to pre-vent falls but often result in more serious injurybecause patients attempt to climb over themand may fall from a greater height (O'Keefe,Jack, & Lye, 1996). Similar interventions applicable to the com- munity setting include removing clutter, throwrugs, and cords and wires; installing handrailson stairs, bathtubs, and showers; using rubberbath mats in the shower and tub; installing Table 12-3 Components of a Physical Assessment to Identify Intrinsic Risk Factors for Falls Physical Assessment ProblemPulse ArrhythmiasBlood pressure Postural Deficits in acuity, depth perception, accommodation, PERRLA peripheral visionMuscle strength Weakness in one or both sidesROM in neck, spine, and extremities Pain, limitation in range of motionGait and balance Deficits in postural control, balance coordination, station, Gait and movements, Romberg test and gait28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 488 Falls 489 a raised toilet; marking stairs and thresholdswith fluorescent tape; encouraging the use ofeyeglasses and hearing aids; and maintainingadequate lighting throughout the house. Ade-quate lighting includes installing night-lightsthroughout the house, using 100-watt nonglarelightbulbs (ceiling lights are best), placing alight switch at the entrance to prevent the elderfrom entering a dark house or rooms, and ensur-ing that all stairwells and hallway are well lit toavoid shadows.Evaluate Gait and BalanceAssess muscle strength and ability frequentlyand institute appropriate measures for safemobility and transfer techniques.

Do not leavepatients with gait and balance deficiencies insituations where they can attempt to get up andmove without support and assistance; for exam-ple, avoid leaving a patient in the bathroomalone. In the community setting, encourage a regu- lar exercise program to improve balance andcoordination, such as tai chi or yoga, based onthe individual's abilities. Involve older patientsin an exercise program to increase musclestrength, such as low-intensity leg strengthen-ing and weight-bearing exercises. It is impor-tant to educate clients on what to do if they fall.Useful techniques include turning from thesupine position to the prone position, getting onall fours, crawling to a strong support surface,and pulling up. Having frequent contact withfamily or friends, a phone that can be reachedfrom the floor, or a remote alarm system candecrease the likelihood of lying on the floor fora long time after a fall (Beers & Berkow, 2005). If the older person uses an assistive device such as a walker, teach and monitor the proper use ofthese devices. For example, a rolling walker maybe safer than a regular walker if the older personis unable to lift the standard walker or attemptsto carry the walker. Check the tip end of walk-ers and canes to be sure they have sufficientsmooth tread and replace when necessary. Alsomake sure all moving parts are clean and anyrough edges are smoothed or covered to preventdamage to the skin. Providing hip protectors forpatients in institutions with a high incidence ofhip fractures appears to reduce the incidence ofsuch fractures (Gillespie, Gillespie, Cummings,Lamb, & Rowe, 2000). However, because theyare heavy, are made of polypropylene, and mustbe worn 24 hours a day, compliance in their useis only between 30% and 50%. Review MedicationsDuring an inpatient admission is a good time tothoroughly review all the medications thepatient is on for desired effect, adverse effect,interactions, and the older person's knowledgebase of the medications they are taking. Thiswould include identifying the patient's knowl-edge of the drug, dosage, administration, andadverse effects, as well as compliance. It is alsoessential to ask about over-the-counter medica-tions he or she is also taking. Patients on four ormore medications are at a higher risk for falls(Capezuti, 1996). Special attention should begiven to drugs that affect mobility such assedatives, hypnotics, psychotropics, and anti-hypertensives. Patients should be taught aboutinterventions to prevent postural hypotensionsuch as changing positions slowly to preventsyncope. When beginning a new medication,elders should be monitored closely, especially ifthe medication has the potential to effect mobil-ity, balance, and/or cognition. Additional strate-gies for helping older persons to manage theirmedications are discussed in the \"Polypharm-acy\" section earlier in the chapter.Develop a Fall Prevention PlanTinniti et al. (1988) found that risk of fallingincreased with the number of disabilities, butthat modifying just a few factors may reducethe risk. Vassallo et al. (2004) describe a mul-tidisciplinary, proactive approach to fall pre-vention in a rehabilitation hospital that led toa 15.3% reduction in the number of falls and a51.1% reduction in patients sustaining an28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 490 Falls 491 Table 12-4 Performance-Oriented Assessment of Gait Observation Components Normal /H110050 Abnormal /H110051 Number Initiation of and side; donot judge few steps;observe one side at atime)Step symmetry(observe the middlepart of the patch, notthe first or last steps;observe from side;observe distancebetween heel multipleattempts; initiation not a not com-pletely raised off floor(may hear scraping) oris raised too high (/H110221-2 inches) Step length less thandescribed under nor-mal conditions Step length variesbetween sides orpatient advances withsame foot with everystepPlaces entire immediatelywithout hesitation;initiation of gait is single, smoothmotionSwings foot, completely clearsfloor but by no more than 1-2inchesAt least the length of individual'sfoot between the stance toe andswing heel (step length usuallylonger but foot length providesbasis for observation)Step length same or nearly sameon both sides for most step cycles Begins raising heel of one foot(toes off) as heel of other foottouches the floor (heel strike); nobreaks or stops in stride; steplengths equal over most (continues)28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 491 492 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problem Table 12-4 Performance-Oriented Assessment of Gait (continued) Observation Components Normal /H110050 Abnormal /H110051 Numbe r Path deviation,observe Any of precedingfeatures present Feet apart withsteppingStaggers; stops before initiating turn;or steps are discon-tinuousFoot follows close to straight lineas patient advances Trunk does not sway; knees orback are not flexed; arms are notabducted in effort to maintainstabilityFeet should almost touch as onepasses otherNo staggering; turning iscontinuous with walking, andsteps are continuous whileturning Add up numbers in Number column to get TOTAL SCORE : A higher score reflects greater risk for falls.

At-risk patients were identified with a red armband. Other essential components ofa fall prevention program include close routinemonitoring, anticipation of needs, offering fre-quent toileting, bedside commodes, call lights,bed alarms, transfer techniques, hip protectors,a regular exercise program, and patient andfamily education. Reduction of fractures andless serious injuries from falls resulted fromtreatment of osteoporosis with calcium andvitamin D (Gallager, UseAgitation or confusion caused by delirium is aparticularly significant risk for falls (Hayes, 2004;Holmes & House, 2000). Harrison, Booth, andAlgase (2001) reported that patients who experi-ence multiple falls typically have lower cognitivescores. Restrictive procedures were designed toreduce or eliminate maladaptive or unsafe behav-iors (e.g., falls, the removal of medical devices,wandering away). However, Tinetti et al. (1988)found that the use of physical restraints failed toprevent falls and was associated with continuedfall-related accidents as well as an increase in seri-ous injuries from a fall. Restrictive proceduresinvolve the use of physical restraints and chem- ical restraints . A physical restraint is any phys- ical or mechanical device (e.g., waist restraint,wrist restraint, geriatric chair) that involuntarilyrestrains a patient as a means of controlling phys-ical activity. A chemical restraint refers to the useof a psychopharmacological drug for the purposeof discipline or convenience, and not to treatmedical symptoms (Ledford & Mentes, 1997).The deconditioning effect of immobility result-ing from the use of a restraint compounded byimpaired judgment secondary to dementia wereimplicated as underlying factors in these findings(Tinetti et al., 1988). Ledford & Mentes (1997)reported 13%-47% of older patients who fall arephysically restrained. There are six common myths associated with the use of restraints in the elderly (Evans &Strumph, 1990): Myth: Elderly clients should be restrainedto protect them from falls. Fact: The risk of falls and injury in-creases when restraints are used. Myth: It is a moral duty to protect theelderly from harm by use ofrestraints. Fact: Restraints put the elderly athigher risk for with im-mobility such aspressure ulcers, contractures, andconfusion. Myth: Failure to restrain puts individu-als at risk for legal liability. Fact: U.S. courts are reluctant to holdthat there exists a duty to restrain,stating that restraint use is unde-sirable and decreases the patient'squality of life. Myth: It doesn't bother the elderly to berestrained. Fact: Many elderly experience feelingsof anger, fear, humiliation, dis-comfort, demoralization, and pun-ishment when they are restrained(Strumph & Evans, 1988). Myth: We have to restrain because of in-adequate staffing. Fact: In facilities where restraint-freepolicies exist, alternatives to re-straints appear to consume lessstaff time than that required byusing restraints. Myth: Alternatives to physical restraintsare unavailable.Falls 493 Box 12-6 Types of Physical Restraints Wrist and leg restraintsWheelchair safety barsVest restraintsMittsChairs with lapboardsBeds 494 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems Fact: Many alternatives exist includingcompanionship or supervision,changing or eliminating bother-some treatment, environmentalmanipulations, reality orientation,psychosocial interventions, and di-versionary and physical activities. Despite standards aimed at minimal or no restraint use, approximately 15% of nursinghome residents spend a portion of the day inrestraints or confined inappropriately by side-rails. In acute care, 18%-25% of those aged 65years or older, and up to 22% of those aged 75years or older, are restrained (Hartford Institutefor Geriatric Nursing). Instead of preventingharm, the use of physical and/or chemicalrestraints can have an adverse impact on func-tioning. The use of physical restraints increasesthe risk for falls, confusion, death by strangula-tion, and complications of immobility (e.g.,contractures, pressure ulcers, pneumonia, hypotension, sedation, tardivedyskinesia, and extrapyramidal and anticholin-ergic side effects are associated with the use ofchemical restraints (Ledford & Mentes, 1997). A restraint-free environment is the ideal. Nursing care should focus on reducing, and hope-fully eliminating, the need for restraints. A vari-ety of interventions have been identified asalternatives to restraints. Providing companion-ship and supervision from staff, family, friends, orvolunteers prevents the patient from being alone.This is most important during the night whenpatients often become disoriented and wander.Bothersome treatments such as IVs, NG tubes,catheters, and drains need to be assessed for thepossibility of being changed or removed. Envir-onments should be designed to decrease confusion,overstimulation, and safety concerns. Examples ofthis would be lighting that eliminates shadows,low noise levels, beds in low positions withsiderails down, accessible call lights, and a quickresponse to the call light. The use of reality orien-tation, therapeutic touch, reality links such asradios and televisions, and active listening are allappropriate interventions to reduce and/or preventanxiety and confusion. Diversional and physicalactivities are also helpful in preventing the use ofrestraints. Other successful interventions includethe use of music therapy, pressure-sensitive bedalarms, toileting regimes per the patient's ownschedule, placing a sponge ball in the hand to pre-vent pulling on tubes, giving the patient a pictureof a family member to hold, or giving them asmall pillow or stuffed animal to hug. Falls present a serious health problem for mil- lions of elders, often resulting in injury, loss ofindependence, and a reduction in quality of life.Although all falls are not preventable, identify-ing an individual's risk factors for falls and imple-menting appropriate interventions in response tothe identified risks can play a vital role in pre-venting falls and minimizing injuries from a fall.The negative outcomes of physically and/orchemically restraining an elder to prevent injuriesare well documented. The ability to minimizeinjuries and avoid restraints is dependent on thecreativity and vigilance of the nursing staff andadministrative support. Nurses must strive for arestraint-free environment to prevent physicaland psychological harm in the older patient. Anxiety Prevalence The U.S. Surgeon General reported that 11.4%of adults over the age of 55 met criteria for anx-28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 494 iety disorders, with phobic anxiety disordersbeing the most prevalent in older adults. Non-specific anxiety rates are reported to be up to17% in older men and 21% in older women(U.S. Public Health Service, 2000). Implications/Relevance of Anxiety Anxiety is a normal adaptive reaction to new sit-uations or perceived threats and can manifest astachycardia and palpitations, gastrointestinaldisorders, insomnia, and tachypnea. A studentmay experience this during a class final exami-nation or while performing a skill on a patientfor the first time. This physiologic reaction, dur-ing which the sympathetic nervous system isdominant, serves to motivate and energize.However, recurring and chronic anxiety cancomplicate many illnesses, including hyperten-sion, heart disease, chronic obstructive pul-monary disease, and diabetes, and can interferewith activities of daily living. Anxiety inpatients with chronic medical conditions sig-nificantly increases their duration of disability.The presence of anxiety in the older adult cor-relates with and predicts cognitive decline andimpairment (Sinoff & Werner, 2003). Feeney(2004) measured the relationship between anx-iety and pain perception in a population overthe age of 65 and found that anxiety signifi-cantly elevated acute pain perception. Duringthe relaxation response, the parasympatheticnervous system is dominant. Warning Signs/Risk Factors for Anxiety Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder andpanic disorder . Generalized anx- iety disorder (GAD) is characterized by persis-Anxiety 495 tent, excessive worry with fluctuating severityof symptoms that include restlessness, irritabil-ity, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and impairedconcentration. This disorder typically manifestsearly in life, but is a chronic condition that con-tinues into the later adult years. Many individ-uals with GAD also have significant depression. Panic attacks are characterized by an auto- nomic arousal that includes tachycardia, diffi-culty breathing, diaphoresis, light-headedness,trembling, and severe weakness. Between attacks,the individual spends a great deal of time andenergy worrying about the next exacerbation.Genetics appear to play a significant role, with a20% risk among relatives of individuals withpanic disorder. The older adult may experience adecreased autonomic response to emotional statesand symptoms may be masked (Mohlman et al.,2004); therefore, cues to anxiety problems maybe subtle and easily overlooked. Nonspecificcomplaints such as weakness, feeling light-headed, or a slight increase in heart and respira-tory rate may signal anxiety. Older adults with chronic medical conditions are at a much higher risk for the development ofanxiety disorders when compared to those with-out chronic illnesses (Beekman et al., 1998;Mehta et al., 2003). Psychosocial stressors andnegative life events, such as the death of a Box 12-7 Medical Conditions That Cause or Exacerbate Anxiety Cardiac arrhythmias HypoglycemiaHyperthyroidism PheochromocytomaChronic obstructive Hypertension pulmonary disease28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 495 496 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems spouse, significantly increase the incidence ofanxiety in older adults. Catastrophic events inearly life, poor subjective health, lack of an ade-quate support network, loneliness, and per-ceived vulnerability all contribute to the risk of developing anxiety disorders in later life(Beekman et al.). Assessment Instruments available to assess anxiety includethe State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) andthe Hospital-Anxiety Inventory. An importantconcept in using assessment instruments is todetermine each one's appropriateness in the spe-cific population. An instrument that has beenresearched only in the critical care setting maynot prove as useful in the community-dwellingpopulation. Nursing assessment should includerisk identification, medical evaluation, and care-ful attention to the client's verbalization ofthoughts and feelings. Anxiety and depressionare often undetected in the older population,and nurses are in key positions to identify bothrisks and symptoms of these problems. Success-ful treatment increases the quality of life in theolder adult; a goal of care should be early iden-tification and intervention. Interventions/Strategies for Care Nursing interventions in the acute care settinginclude instructions prior to painful proceduresand in self-management of pain. Many interven-tions for pain, such as relaxation, breathing tech-niques, distraction, and cognitive restructuring,can simultaneously decrease anxiety (Feeney,2004). If patients perceive higher levels of con-trol in any situation, anxiety is reduced. Com- Box 12-8 Drugs That Can Cause or Worsen Anxiety Baclofen CaffeinePseudoephedrine TheophyllineBox 12-9 Nursing Care for the Patient Experiencing Acute Anxiety Decrease environmental stimuli.Stay with the patient.Make no demands and do not ask the patient to make decisions. Support current coping mechanisms (crying, talking, etc.). Don't confront or argue with the patient.Speak slowly in a soft, calm voice.Avoid reciprocal anxiety. (Emotions can be contagious, and sensing anxiety in thenurse can worsen the patient's anxiety.) Reassure the patient that the problem can be solved. Reorient the patient to reality.Respect the patient's personal space. Box 12-10 Deep Breathing Exercises Have the patient sit in a comfortable chair, with hands on the abdomen. Askthe patient to inhale slowly and deeply,feeling the abdomen rise. Hold the breathfor a few seconds. Ask the patient toexhale slowly, allowing the abdomen todeflate. Repeat several times, alwaysspeaking in a soft, calm manner.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 496 Depression 497 munity and social resources should be identifiedand made available to those with chronic anxietydisorders. It does not benefit a patient to have ahealth care practitioner referral if they are unableto arrange transportation or financial support toinitiate or continue their care. Medications to treat anxiety include azepines, selective serotonin and psychomotor problems, confusion, anddepression. SSRIs may result in side effects ofheadache, nausea, sedation, and insomnia. Individuals of any age often experience anxi- ety and depression simultaneously. Rates of anx-iety in older adults with depression have beenreported as high as 47% (Mehta et al., 2003). Depression Prevalence Although depression is the most common mental health disorder in older adults, it is nota normal consequence of aging. Role changes,major life events, and comorbid illnesses all con-tribute to an increased rate of depression in thegeriatric population. According to the U.S.Surgeon General, 19.8% of American adultsover the age of 55 experience mental disorders,with depression and anxiety occurring most fre-quently. In older adults with comorbid illnesses,the rate of depression is as high as 37% (U.S.Public Health Service, 2000). Implications/Relevance of Depression Depression is a significant risk for suicide, andolder adults have the highest rates of suicide inthe United States. Many geriatric individualswho commit suicide have primary care visitswithin one month of the suicide, yet symptomsof depression are often undetected or inade-quately treated by the medical practitioner.Box 12-11 Progressive Muscle Relaxation The patient should lie down in a com- fortable position. Ask the patient totighten the muscles in his or her hand for afew seconds, and then completely releasethe tension to relax the muscle. Focusingon a specific muscle by tightening andreleasing tension provides a greater relax-ation response to the area. Progressivelyconcentrate on the muscles of the arms,shoulders, face, chest, back, abdomen, legs,and feet. Again, use a soft, calm voice toassist the patient through the process. Box 12-12 Cognitive- Behavioral Therapy Cognitive-behavioral therapy assists the patient with recognizing cues to anxiety.Once they have identified factors thatcause their anxiety, they are able to cogni-tively \"practice\" experiencing those situa-tions. Effective coping mechanisms areidentified and used during the therapy.When the patient encounters the situationin real life, he or she is able to copebecause they have had the opportunity tocognitively review their reactions.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 497 498 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems Depression is linked to a decreased quality of lifein the older adult, through loss of interest, moti-vation, creativity, and ability to plan (Fassino etal., 2002). Depressed individuals perceive med-ical illnesses as having a greater impact oneveryday life and have twice the health care costsof nondepressed adults with similar illnesses(Badger & Collins-Joyce, 2000). Older adultswith depression have higher mortality ratesfrom coexisting conditions, such as cardiovas-cular disease and cancer. In an epidemiologicalstudy, depression of more than 4 years raised therisk of cancer in older adults by 88% (Pennix etal., 1998). Surgical patients who are depressedhave poorer outcomes and lengthier recoveries(Alexopoulous et al., 2002). Therefore, earlyidentification and treatment of depression are ofkey importance in improving the quality and,possibly, the quantity of life for older adults. Depression, Dementia,and Delirium Depression in the older adult can often be diffi-cult to recognize. Dementia ,delirium , medi- cation side effects, and situational grief responsecan complicate the diagnosis of depression. TheAmerican Psychiatric Association (2000) hasstandard diagnostic criteria for delirium, depres-sion, and dementia. Delirium manifests as adisturbance in consciousness or cognitive or per-ceptual change that develops over a period oftime, fluctuates during the course of the day, andis a physiological consequence of a medical con-dition or medication. Delirium can often beresolved by altering external or internal factors.Sleep pattern disturbances can be the etiology fordelirium, and close attention should be given tothe client's sleep-wake cycle and sleep patterns.Forty-five to fifty-nine adults experience delirium, and in 25% ofthose cases, irreversible neurological damage ordeath occurs (Martin & Haynes, 2000). Dementia, a group of symptoms accompany- ing disease, manifests as memory loss; disorien-tation; changes in mood or personality; anddifficulties in abstract thinking, task perfor-mance, and language use. Dementia is a grad-ual, but continuous, cognitive decline. The mostcommon form of dementia is Alzheimer's dis-ease. Other disorders associated with the devel-opment of dementia include brain attacks,Huntington's disease, AIDS, and Parkinson'sdisease (Martin & Haynes, 2000). Antidepres-sant medications do not improve symptoms ofdementia in patients with primary dementiadisorders (Raj, 2004). The American Psychiatric Association (2000) defines depression as a disorder that includeschanges in feelings or mood, described as feel-ing sad, hopeless, pessimistic, or \"blue\" lastingmost of the day, with loss of interest in plea-surable activities. These symptoms represent achange from the person's previous level of func-Box 12-13 Medical Conditions that Increase Risk of Depression Hypothyroidism Arthritis Hypertension Stroke/brain attackHeart disease Diabetes Arthritis Parkinson's Disease Multiple sclerosis Cancer Huntington's disease28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 498 plaining of sadness or depression. This, alongwith societal expectations that older adults aremore fatigued and less interested in activities,can disguise symptoms of depression anddeprive patients of treatment (Amella, 2004). Interventions/Strategies for Care Treatment of depression in the older adult isaimed toward remission and prevention ofrecurrence. Early recognition of risk and appro-priate therapy can increase both the quality andquantity of life in the depressed older client.Pharmacological therapy, including tricyclicantidepressants (TCAs) and SSRIs, require closemonitoring because of the increased risk ofadverse effects in the older individual. SSRIs arethe first choice for treatment of depression in theelderly because they are much safer in overdoseand side effects are better tolerated than those ofTCAs (Raj, 2004). Care must be taken to avoiddrug-drug interactions while considering theolder adult's physiological changes in absorp-tion, metabolism, distribution, and excretion ofdrugs. This is further discussed in Chapter 8.Although older adults respond to antidepres-sants, their response takes longer than youngeradults and they have a higher risk of recurrence. Venlafaxine, which has a high rate of remis- sion, can cause hypertension, headache, sexualdysfunction, and anxiety. SSRIs can cause sexualdysfunction, nausea, diarrhea, headache, anxiety,and tremor. TCAs have anticholinergic effects,including dry mouth, that can result in an inad-equate intake of nutrition, arrhythmias that maybe exacerbated in coexisting heart disease, andfalls related to orthostastic hypotension. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life- threatening condition of elevated serotoninlevels. SSRIs, TCAs, and serotonin receptoragonists all increase serotonin and the risk ofDepression 499 tioning. Depression manifests as a loss of inter-est in life and usual activities, fatigue, decreasedconcentration and short-term memory, changesin appetite, fluctuations in weight and sleephabits, and irritability and anxiety. Depression,dementia, and delirium can also occur simulta-neously, further complicating diagnosis andtreatment (Martin & Haynes, 2000). Assessment Screening instruments for depression in thegeriatric primary care population include theGeriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and SelfCARE(D). The Cornell Scalefor Depression in Dementia (CSDD) is a reliableand valid instrument for assessing depression inolder adults who also have dementia (Watson &Pignon, 2003). Proper diagnosis and treatmentof depression relies on the practitioner's abilityto determine underlying medical conditions ormedication side effects contributing to or caus-ing the depression. Nursing observations andcommunication with clients, families, and care-givers are important in identifying older adultswith depression and those at risk of developingdepression. Many older adults may avoid com- Box 12-14 Drugs 500 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems the syndrome. Symptoms include disorienta-tion, irritability, agitation, anxiety, myoclonus,muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and tachypnea. Treatment consists ofwithdrawing the medication and managingsymptoms. Nursing interventions that can improve depression include exercise, light therapy, alter-native medicine, and counseling (Lam &Kennedy, 2004). Life review therapy, a form ofreminiscence, significantly decreases minordepression in nursing home residents, who havemuch higher rates of depression than their com-munity-dwelling cohorts. Depressed individu-als reminisce about their life and reframedecisions and choices made throughout their life(Haight & Michel, 1998). Events or decisionsthat make the individual unhappy are reinte-grated in a more acceptable manner. Mild tomoderate exercise releases tension and increasesthe body's production of endorphins, which canbe natural mood elevators. Exercises can be aslight as stretching maneuvers such as yoga or taichi or as strenuous as running, aerobics, orswimming. Urinary Incontinence In recent years, the notion of urinary inconti- nence (UI) being an inevitable consequence of aging, of being a woman, or of bearing childrenhas been challenged by research demonstratingeffective treatment for this common problem.Urinary incontinence, defined as the involuntaryleakage of urine, is a common health problemthat affects more than 16 million Americans.However, it has been estimated that about 80%of adults with UI can experience significantimprovement or resolution of their symptomswith evaluation and treatment (Urinary Conti-nence Guideline Panel, 1992). The barrier torealization of this improvement is often a failurein health care to identify those with continenceproblems, to conduct a comprehensive assess-ment, and to initiate targeted interventions toaddress causes and contributing factors. Pro-fessional nursing has the knowledge, skills,opportunity, and responsibility to providebeginning continence care: screening patients,performing a basic evaluation, and initiatingtreatment or refering patients to a specialist ifspecialized care is indicated (Jirovec, Wyman,& Wells, 1998). Prevalence UI affects men and women of all ages, at all lev-els of health, in all settings. Prevalence esti-mates vary widely, primarily due to differencesin the definition of incontinence and the pop-ulation studied. A review of the literature indi-cates a median range between 30% and 40%among middle-aged women that increases to30%-50% in older women living in the com-munity (Hunskaar et al., 2002). Prevalencerates in men have a similar pattern, althoughthe rates are lower. Prevalence rates range from1%-5% in middle-aged men, with rates in-creasing to 9%-28% in older men living in thecommunity (Hunskaar et al.). Incontinence mayaffect up to 43% of acute care patients (Lincoln& Roberts, 1989); prevalence rates in institu-tions rise to 50% or higher (Hunskaar et al.).Although UI is not a normal consequence ofaging, certain physiological changes that ac-company aging increase the risk for develop-ment of voiding problems, and certain conditionsthat predispose to continence problems aremore likely to occur in older persons. Normalaging changes in the urinary system and their28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 500 significance in the older adult were discussed inChapter 6. Implications of UI The adverse impact of UI on physical and psy-chosocial functioning has been frequentlydiscussed in lay and professional literature.Depression and anxiety have long been recog-nized as potential causes and consequences ofincontinence (Dugan et al., 2000; Wells, 1984).Uninhibited bladder activity, especially in olderpeople, is believed to be susceptible to influ-ences of psychological factors such as regression,rebellion, sensory deprivation, and the loss of conditioned reflexes (Ory, Wyman, & Yu,1986). Relationships, activities of daily living,and self-concept are urinaryincontinence 1992; Macauly, Stern, Wyman, Harkins, Choi, Taylor, & Fantl,1987). UI increases the risk of hospitalizationand substantially increases the risk of admissionto nursing homes in persons over 65 years of age(Thom, Haan, & Van Den Eeden, 1997). Urgeincontinence occurring weekly or more fre-quently is associated with an increased risk offalls and nonspine, nontraumatic fractures incommunity-dwelling women aged 65 years andolder (Brown et al., 2000). Incontinence is oneof the major risk factors for the development ofskin breakdown (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services, 1994). The economicimpact of UI also is substantial, with costsestimated to be $16.3 billion per year in 1995dollars (Wilson et al., 2001). The cost for man-agement is often an out-of-pocket expense (notcovered by insurance) and may interfere withthe ability of a person on a fixed income to pur-chase medications or supplies to manage otherhealth problems.Urinary Incontinence 501 The nature and degree to which negative consequences result from incontinence is some-what controversial (Thomas & Morse, 1991).The vast majority of incontinent persons in thecommunity do not seek help for their inconti-nence because they consider it a normal part ofaging (Urinary Continence Guideline Panel,1992). This raises questions about how peoplewith this problem perceive UI and what deter-mines the significance attributed to the prob-lem. Many noninstitutionalized individuals Burgio, 1992; Jeter & Wagner, 1990). Relatively little is known about factors that influence one's perception of incontinence.Women with urge incontinence and mixedincontinence reported more emotional distur-bance than an age-matched control group with-out incontinence, and women with all types ofincontinence were more socially isolated thanthe control group (Grimby, Milson, Molander,Wiklund, & Ekelund, 1993). Other studies sup-port that sensory or irritative symptoms are themost problematic (Wyman, 1994b). The influ-ence of the severity of incontinence on the effectsattributed to incontinence is not clear. Inter-views with women 31-50 years old suggest thelength of time a person has been incontinentinfluences the impact of the incontinence(Skoner, 1994). Women who had been inconti- Box 12-15 The majority of people with urinary incontinence have not sought help. Healthcare providers must take the initiative andscreen persons at risk.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 501 502 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems nence is associated with a strong, abrupt desire to void, and the inability to inhibit leakage intime to reach a toilet. Uninhibited bladder con-tractions usually, but not always, are a precipi-tating factor. Central nervous system disorders,such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, and localirritations such as infection or ingestion of blad-der irritants (e.g., caffeine) are potential causes.Reflex incontinence, a variation of urge incon- tinence, results from uninhibited bladder con-tractions with no sensation of needing to voidor urgency (Consensus Conference, 1989). Thiscondition is seen most often in spinal lesionstransecting the cord above T10-11. Overflow incontinence refers to overdistention of the bladder due to abnormal emptying. The leak-age may be continual or resemble the symptomsof stress or urge incontinence. Overflow incon-tinence results from a weak or areflexic bladder,neurologic conditions such as diabetes, spinalcord injury below T10-11, or obstruction of thebladder outlet or urethra (Urinary ContinenceGuideline Panel, 1992). Functional inconti- nence refers to problems from factors external to the lower urinary tract such as cognitiveimpairments, physical disabilities, and envi-ronmental barriers (Urinary Continence Guide-line Panel, 1992). Although separate disorders,clinically, patients may exhibit symptoms ofmore than one type of incontinence. Pure stressand pure urge incontinence were uncommon in a urodynamic evaluation of 263 women and men aged 65 years and older (Ouslander,Hepps, Raz, & Su, 1986). The term mixed incontinence refers to the existence of the symptoms of urge and stress incontinence at thesame time. Diagnosis of the type(s) of UI expe-rienced is essential to the development of inter-ventions that must be designed according to ormodified to address varying levels of cognitiveand physical functioning. nent longer were more relaxed and spoke moreobjectively about their incontinence in compar-ison to those with recent onset of incontinence(Skoner, 1994). Assessment An understanding of the types of incontinenceand the factors associated with incontinence isnecessary to guide evaluation and the develop-ment of appropriate targeted interventions.Urinary incontinence is categorized as transient (acute) or established (chronic) based on onset and etiology. Transient incontinence is causedby the onset of an acute problem that once suc-cessfully treated will result in the resolution ofincontinence. Multiple causative and contribu-tory factors have been associated with the devel-opment or exacerbation of voiding problems, inparticular UI. Table sient causes and potentially reversible factors; abrief explanation of the basis for their impact oncontinence is provided. If transient causes areruled out or treated and incontinence continues,the problem is considered established. Chronic incontinence encompasses four basic disorders: stress, urge, overflow, and functionalincontinence. Stress incontinence refers to the involuntary loss of urine during activities thatincrease intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., lifting,coughing, sneezing, and laughing). Stressincontinence is distinguished from urge leakageor overflow incontinence by the absence ofbladder contraction or overdistention, respec-tively. The most common causes of stress incon-tinence are hypermobility of the bladder neckand urethral sphincter defects. Weakness of thepelvic floor muscles leads to loss of support forthe bladder neck and disrupts the normal pres-sure gradient between the bladder and urethra,resulting in leakage of urine (Urinary Conti-nence Guideline Panel, 1992). Urinary Incontinence 503 Variability in the types of voiding problems that may be experienced and the diverse nature ofcausative and contributing factors necessitate acomprehensive evaluation of urologic function-ing. The evaluation recommended by the ClinicalPractice Guidelines on Urinary Incontinence forAdults outlines the components that should beincluded in an initial evaluation (UrinaryIncontinence Guideline Panel, 1992). The ele-ments of a basic evaluation are outlined in Table 12-6 and discussed in greater detail in the fol- lowing text with respect to the older patient.Table 12-5 Transient Causes of Urinary Incontinence The mnemonic DIAPPERS has been established to list common causes of transient incontinence. Common Causes RationaleDelerium/dementia Altered cognitive functioning interferes with the ability to recognize the need for toileting or respond in a timely manner. Infection The urinary frequency and urgency associated with symptomatic UTI may lead to urinary incontinence. Atrophic vaginitis/urethritis Decreased estrogen in women results in thin, dry, friable vaginal and urethra mucosa. Psychological Depression may interfere with an individual's motivation and desire to perform activities of daily living or attend to continence.Anxiety or fear that leakage will occur may contribute to frequency anddifficulties controlling urge. Pharmacological agents Inadequate management of acute or chronic pain can interfere with the ability to attend to toileting needs. Narcotics, a component of many painmanagement regimens, can lead to constipation and fecal impaction thatobstructs the bladder neck, leading to urine retention, overflow incon-tinence, and urgency. Narcotics can also decrease bladder muscle con-traction resulting in urine retention, incomplete bladder emptying,increased risk for UTI, and overflow incontinence.Many medications have adverse or unintended side effects that maydirectly impact bladder function, bladder relaxation, urinary sphincterrelaxation or obstruction, cognitive status (awareness of an effectiveresponse to need to void), or urine production.Polypharmacy increases the risk for adverse drug effects and drug inter-actions. Endocrine disease Metabolic conditions (hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, low insipidus) associated with polyuria increase fluid loadon the bladder and increase the risk for urge and stress incontinence. Restricted mobility Limited ability to move about interferes with the ability to reach a toi- let in time to prevent leakage. Stool impaction Overdistention of the rectum or anal canal can obstruct the bladder neck, leading to urine retention, overflow incontinence, and urgency.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 503 504 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems HistoryThe first step in the evaluation is a discussion ofvoiding patterns and problems. Initiating thisline of questioning by focusing on usual num-ber of voids during the day and through thenight, and the presence of other symptoms ofvoiding problems such as burning, hesitancy,pain, or low pelvic pressure, provides a lessthreatening opening to this topic while secur-ing useful information. It may be necessary toreword questions about the presence of incon-tinence to determine the occurrence of wettingaccidents, their frequency, and volume of urinelost. Asking about the use of padding or pro-tective garments may also provide importantclues to the presence of incontinence or the fearof an accident. The onset and duration of void-ing problems and activities that precipitate orare associated with their occurrence should beascertained as well. Of particular relevance isdetermining the status of bowel functioning andusual bowel habits. A recall of daily food andfluid intake also provides important informationin the evaluation of urological functioning anddevelopment of a treatment plan. It is notuncommon for patients with urgency and urgeincontinence to report a fluid intake that con-sists primarily of bladder irritants (e.g., dietdrinks, carbonated caffeinated beverages), andminimal to no water. Dietary modificationsalone have often significantly reduced urgencyand problems precipitated by urge. The initialinterview should help identify potentiallyreversible causative factors and contributing riskfactors for UI. The history should provide cluesto type(s) of incontinence involved. Table 12-7 lists common reversible factors in UI. An awareness of the specific symptoms experi- enced and the degree of discomfort associatedwith each can be useful in determining the pri-ority for intervening. Individual responses toincontinence vary greatly (Wyman, 1994b).Identifying those aspects of daily life that incon-tinence or the fear of incontinence disrupt willhelp specify outcomes to evaluate the success oftreatment. For example, if UI interferes with exer-cise, then participation in a exercise regimen threetimes a week might be the goal set with thepatient that is evidence of an effective plan of care. Interviews and conversations with persons experiencing incontinence have revealed the dif-ficulty many experience thinking about and dis-cussing this very personal and usually privatematter. The use of a tool that provides words andchoices for responses frequently facilitates theexchange of information.

By outlining the timing, amount,and type of fluid intake with the timing,amount, and continence status for each void, keydata are collected to document the severity ofincontinence, list any irritative or associatedsymptoms that are present, identify precipitat-ing events, and detect any patterns to voidingproblems (Wyman, 1994). Bladder record datamay be self-reported or completed by caregivers;a bladder diary has been found to be a reliablemethod for assessing the frequency of voluntaryvoiding and involuntary incidents of urine loss(Wyman, Choi, Harkins, Wilson, & Fantl,1988). A 3-day diary provides sufficient data toclassify frequency and number of incontinentepisodes (Doughty, 2000). See Figure 12-3 for a sample voiding diary. In the clinical setting,the 3-day diary facilitated the collection ofinformation while allowing patients the oppor-tunity to adjust to the transfer. Patients' andcaregivers' participation in the record keepingis advantageous. Many times patients or care-givers completing these records pick up patternsto the occurrence of incontinence and can beginto make positive changes. The bladder diary is a particularly important source for data to help differentiate factors innighttime voiding. Nocturia , the awakening from sleep to urinate, is a frustrating and commonproblem for many older persons. Nocturia mayresult from alterations in normal circadian rhythmof urine output, physiological changes in thelower urinary tract that interfere with storage, ormay be an indication of sleep apnea (Donahue &Lowenthal, in with cardiovascular diseaseand is the root cause of nocturia in this popula-tion. Comorbidities of diabetes mellitus andhypertension greatly increase the risk of sleepapnea (Umlauf & Chasens, 2003). Symptoms ofthe disorder and treatment options are discussedlater in the chapter. Measurement of volume of urine voided throughout a 72-hour period considered with theresults of the physical examination and historywill help determine factors contributing to noc-turia, identify possible strategies for manage-ment, and indicate the need for further workup(Miller). The serious nature of sleep apnea neces-sitates a careful evaluation of the etiology of noc-turia (Pressman, Figueroa, Kendrick-Mohamed,Greenspan, & Peterson, 1996). Cognitive StatusA client's insight into their voiding status, recallof pertinent health information, and ability toparticipate in an interview are the first clues tocognitive status. Objective cognitive evaluationmay be conducted with the Mini Mental StateExam (MMSE) (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,1973). A more focused assessment of cognitivefunctioning as it relates to toileting may beaccomplished in the 3-day assessment and trialfor responsiveness to prompted voiding, dis-cussed under \"Interventions/Strategies for Care.\"The level of severity of cognitive impairmentalerts health care professionals to the client'sincreased risk for persistent incontinence. It alsoguides selection of options for the first line ofintervention. It is tempting to base the diagnosis of the type of incontinence demonstrated on the clin-ical signs and symptoms from the history; how-ever, clinical symptoms alone are not sufficientto determine the pathophysiology of voidingproblems (Rich & Pannill, 1999). Focused phys-ical examination of the genitourinary, rectal, andneurologic systems is a necessary component ofthe basic evaluation. 28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:32 PM Page 506 Time Drinks Urine Accidental Leaks Did you feel a What were you doing How much? strong urge to go? at the time?

Grossmotor skills (e.g., locomotion, transfer skills,sitting balance), dexterity (e.g., managing but-tons, zippers, and toilet paper), and the abilityto communicate the need for assistance or reli-ably respond to verbal or written words must beassessed. Functional deficits and capabilitiesshould be evaluated as barriers and/or assets incontinence promotion. Calculating the averagetime it takes a patient to access a toilet and geton a commode in conjunction with a patient'sability to suppress the urge or delay voiding willhelp identify therapeutic interventions neededto facilitate continence, goals for the interven-tions, and the type of continence possible. An initial and ongoing evaluation of hydra- tion is essential to diagnosing dehydration andminimizing its complications, which rangefrom the local effects on voiding from concen-trated, irritative urine to more systemic prob-lems resulting from increased confusion andlethargy that can interfere with all aspects ofdaily life. Physical parameters of hydration sta-tus (e.g., oral mucous membranes, sublingualsaliva pool, weight changes, confusion, muscleweakness) may be masked by the deficits ofstroke or treatment of concurrent health prob-lems. Monitoring the balance between fluidintake and urine output, urine color, and thespecific gravity (SG) for the second void of theday are useful indicators of fluid status. Urinetests are better predictors of a risk for orimpending dehydration (Mentes). Urine SG ofgreater than 1.020 and a dark yellow or brown-ish green urine color indicate the need forincreased fluid intake (Armstrong, 2000). Bloodtests such as BUN/creatinine ratio, osmo-lality, and serum predictors of actualdehydration (Mentes). Using height and weightto determine body mass index (BMI) can alsoassist in identifying persons at risk /H1102227) (Mentes). In will provide an indication of theextent of obesity, which contributes to voidingproblems. In women, the pelvic examination should include assessment of the integrity of the per-ineal skin for lesions, irritation, or inflamma-tion. Evidence of atrophic vaginal changesincluding pale, thin, dry, friable mucosa andcomplaints of vaginal itching, dryness, a burn-ing sensation, and dyspareunia should be noted.Vaginal pH levels /H110225 in women without evi- dence of a vaginal infection are also indicative ofpoorly (Shull urethritis and vaginitis con-tribute to urgency and leakage and may betreated with topical estrogen therapy. Womenshould also be checked for pelvic organ prolapse;prolapse beyond the introitus or that is symp-tomatic should be referred for further evaluationand treatment. Multiple types and sizes of pes-saries are available for correction of prolapse. Inmen, examination of the external genitaliashould include inspection of the skin, locationof the urethral meatus, and retractability of theforeskin, if present. An evaluation of the strength of the pelvic floor muscles is an important component of theexamination. However, consideration must begiven to the appropriateness of performing an28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 508 Urinary Incontinence 509 invasive, potentially uncomfortable and embar-rassing digital examination, particularly in frailolder women or moderately to severely cogni-tively impaired elders. Lekan-Ruteledge (2004)explains this decision as informationversus the \"must know\" by deter-mining if the data are essential to developingthe treatment plan. If the individual is capableof learning pelvic muscle exercises, adhering toan exercise regimen, and using the pelvic mus-cles to inhibit an urge or suppress urine flow, adigital examination may be needed to evaluatepelvic muscle control. In the pelvic exam, a gloved, lubricated fin- ger is inserted into the vagina and the patientis instructed to contract her pelvic floor mus-cles against the examiner's finger. One or twofingers are placed in an anterior-posteriorplane. The Digital Rating Scale, presented inTable 12-8 , has been found to be a reliable and valid tool to evaluate pelvic muscle strength in women (Brink, Sampselle, Wells, Diokno,& Gillis, 1989). This evaluation also provideskey information on the patient's ability toisolate and identify the correct muscles. Thestrength and duration of contraction of themuscles also may be evaluated rectally inwomen with vaginal stenosis and in men. Ifthe vaginal exam is not indicated, proceed tothe rectal examination. The rectal examination provides information about the integrity of sacral innervation, pelvicmuscle strength, and the presence of a fecalimpaction. Resting and active anal sphinctertone is assessed. The ability to voluntarily con-tract the anal sphincter indicates a functionalpelvic floor and intact innervation to the pelvicfloor. The presence of sensation of the perineumindicates intact sacral nerve roots for the exter-nal urethral and anal sphincter (Schull et al.,2000). This is a particularly important evalua-tion in diabetics who may experience neuropa-thy that interferes with normal sensory input,which can result in overdistention and urinaryretention. The digital rectal examination (DRE) is an essential component of the incontinence assess-ment. In men, the prostate may be palpatedproximal to the internal anal sphincter throughthe anterior rectal wall, noting size, consistency,and tenderness. It must be remembered that Table 12-8 Digital Rating Scale Pressure Duration Displacement of Vertical Plane1 /H11005No response 2 /H11005Weak squeeze; felt as a flicker at various points along finger surface,not all the way around 3 /H11005Moderate squeeze; felt all the way around the finger surface 4 /H11005Strong squeeze; full circumference of fingers compressed Source: Brink, C.

During the DRE, strengthof the pelvic floor muscles is evaluated and therectal vault is assessed for the presence of largecaliber, hardened stools that suggest constipa-tion or impaction. An impaction must betreated prior to initiating a bladder program. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, full- ness, or masses that may be indicative of fecalimpaction. Bowel sounds are auscultated toevaluate bowel motility. The suprapubic areashould also be palpated to detect bladder ten-derness or distention. Difficulties starting the urine stream, inter- mittent flow, strength of the urine stream, andthe presence of postvoid dribbling may be deter-mined in the interview but also may be evalu-ated directly. The measurement of postvoidresidual urine volume (PVR) is recommended inthe basic evaluation. PVRs are measured bycatheterization or noninvasively with a bladderscanner within a few minutes of voiding. Aportable bladder ultrasound is a useful indicatorto determine the ability to empty the bladder.The bladder scan's reliability and validity aresupported in evaluations in the frail elderly withPVR volumes /H11350150 cc (Borrie et al., 2001). The AHCPR guidelines state that in general,PVRs /H1102150 cc are considered normal, whereas volumes over 200 cc indicate incomplete emp-tying. Adding the volume voided and the PVRvolume will provide an indication of total blad-der capacity. Urinalysis by dipstick or laboratory testing is a component of the initial evaluation of incon-tinence. Urine is checked for white blood cells,nitrites, glucose, and blood. Hydration statuscan also be evaluated with some chemical strips.A UTI should be treated prior to initiation ofother treatment for UI. Treatment of a UTI mayresult in an improvement or resolution of urineleakage, frequency, and/or urgency. Environmental ResourcesThe environment must be evaluated as a factorin the development and treatment of urinaryincontinence. Structural characteristics; thenumber, location, and accessibility of toiletingfacilities; the availability of physical assistance;and adaptive equipment/supplies for toiletingare major considerations (Wyman, Elswick, Ory,Wilson, & Fantl, 1993). Environmental charac-teristics of the hospital and potential dischargedestinations must be evaluated and compared inthe assessment phase. The results should beintegrated into the treatment plan to guide theselection and implementation of interventionsin order to achieve the optimal level of conti-nence at home. Goals for Treatment of UI The goals of treatment for incontinence and theoutcomes for evaluation must be addressed andclarified to assist in determining the types ofinterventions that should be implemented.Understanding the patient's expectations fortreatment outcomes and physical abilities pro-vides direction for intervention. The goals ofthose seeking treatment for incontinence andthe conditions for satisfaction with outcomes aremultidimensional and do not necessarily requiretotal continence (Sale & Wyman, 1994). Continence takes several forms, depending upon the conditions or external resourcesinvolved in achieving control (Fonda, 1990).Control of voiding occurs on various levels,extending from the loss of control (incontinence)to independent continence (control based on the competence of the individual and not requir-ing the assistance of others). Dependent conti-28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 510 Interventions/Strategies for Care Guidelines for the treatment of different typesof UI in specific populations have been devel-oped by national and international panels basedon extensive reviews of the literature (Abrams,Khoury, & Wein, 1999; Fantl et al., 1996). Thethree primary categories of treatment for urinaryincontinence are behavioral therapy, pharmaco-logical intervention, and surgery. Behavioral management refers to interven- tions that modify the patient's behavior or envi-ronment. Strategies included in a behavioralapproach are scheduling regimens, relaxationexercises, urge suppression techniques, andpelvic muscle exercises (PME), with and with-out the addition of biofeedback, vaginal cones,and electrical stimulation as adjunct to the exer-cises. Pharmacological treatment involves med-ications that alter detrusor muscle activity orbladder outlet resistance. Surgical interventionsprimarily are used to increase bladder outletresistance and relieve UI and intrinsic sphinc-teric deficiency or remove a bladder outletobstruction, relieving overflow incontinence(Fantl et al., 1996). Behavioral ApproachesBehavioral approaches are recommended as thefirst line of treatment for urinary incontinence.The clinical practice guidelines identify di-etary modifications (hydration and avoidance of bladder irritants), scheduled voiding,prompted voiding, bladder training protocol,pelvic muscle rehabilitation, and urge suppres-sion techniques as first line approaches in a com-prehensive treatment regimen for UI (Abramset al., 1999; Fantl et al.). Behavioral strategies differ in their mecha- nisms of action, the level of patient participationUrinary Incontinence 511 nence requires the physical assistance of and/or reminders from others to maintain continence.Social continence refers to situations in which continence cannot be achieved, but urine leakageis contained to maintain dignity and comfort. Acategory of partial continence denotes those situations in which a caregiver's assistance ishelpful in achieving continence but is notrequired all of the time (Palmer, 1996). Theeffectiveness of interventions can be evaluatedmore accurately by specifying the level of conti-nence achieved through these categories asopposed to the traditional designation of conti-nent and incontinent. Determination of theeffectiveness of the urinary must the degree to whichthe incontinent individual's personal goals fortreatment were met as well as objective measuresof changes in the severity of incontinence andoccurrence of complications associated withincontinence. The type of continence achievedalso must be specified.Box 12-16 Preventing UI through Healthy Bladder Habits Encourage all clients to practice healthy bladder habits to minimize their risk fordeveloping UI by reviewing the followingstrategies:1. Maintain hydration.2. Avoid bladder irritants.3. Empty the bladder on a regular schedule. 4. Avoid constipation.5. Strengthen and tone the pelvic floor muscles.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 511 512 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems required, and technology involved. The inter-ventions are selected for an individual based onthe type of incontinence, the mental and phys-ical abilities and limitations of the individualpatient, and the environmental resources avail-able (Burgio & Burgio, 1986). The versatility ofbehavioral therapy enables the care providers toadapt and individualize a treatment plan accord-ing to the patient's level of functioning. It alsoallows changes in treatment approaches thatreflect and are congruent with changes in apatient's functional status resulting from recov-ery and rehabilitation. If successful, behavioralapproaches eliminate the added expense andpotential risk to health and well-being of anadverse drug reaction from pharmacologicalintervention and the complications associatedwith surgery. Eliminating reversible factors is a first step in treatment in order to optimize urological func-tioning and the patient's ability to respondfavorably to interventions. The results of theevaluation will identify actual or potential riskproblems that must be addressed to minimize,prevent, or resolve their occurrence. Of partic-ular concern initially is maintaining hydration,promoting regular bowel function, and remov-ing an indwelling urinary catheter while ensur-ing the bladder empties on a regularbasis. Hydration management focuses on main- taining fluid balance. Ensuring an adequate,timely, appropriate fluid intake has long beenrecognized as essential to a successful continenceprogram. An individualized fluid goal must firstbe determined. The standard suggested bySkipper (1993) has been suggested as preferable(Mentes et al., 1998). To calculate fluid intakeaccording to this standard, take 100 mg/kg forthe first 10 kg of weight, 50 ml/kg for the next10 kg, and 15 ml for any remaining kg (Skipper,1993). Because this includes fluid from allsources, to determine the goal for fluid intakealone, 70% of the total volume is used (Menteset al., 1998). Providing fluids throughout theday will help assure the fluid goal is met andminimize frequency and urgency that mayresult from a rapid filling of the bladder fromthe ingestion of a large volume of intake over ashort period. The University of Iowa evidence-based protocol for hydration management sug-gests delivering 75%-80% of fluid at meals and20%-25% during nonmeal times, such as withmedications and planned nourishment (Mentes,1998). This schedule offers the additionaladvantage of ensuring supervision is available (if necessary) for patients with swallowingproblems. Fluid rounds mid-morning and mid-afternoon, in conjunction with offers of assis-tance with toileting, have been effective inreducing incontinence in bedfast nurs-ing home residents and decreasing dehydration(Spangler, Risley, & Bilyew, 1984). Fluid breakscan be incorporated into the daily routine.Planned refreshment breaks in a residential pro-gram or facility that provide socialization, flu-ids, and nourishment could be useful andenjoyable opportunities to meet physical andsocial needs. Fluids should be limited after sup-per, especially if nocturia is present. A final consideration in fluid intake concerns the type of fluids consumed, which should belimited to those without a diuretic or irritanteffect that provide the appropriate consistencyto prevent choking or aspiration. Many commonbeverages may be irritating to the bladder, caus-ing or contributing to urgency. Carbonated andcaffeinated beverages, citrus juices, and aspar-tame are among the products commonly con-sidered to be bladder irritants. A review of the28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 512 bladder diary is especially useful in detectingpossible agents that precipitate urgency orincontinence. Reducing the intake of caffeinatedbeverages to two or fewer servings a day is gen-erally recommended for individuals experiencingurgency or urge incontinence (Arya et al., 2000).Postum and sun teas are potential alternatives forcoffee and tea, respectively. However, water is thebetter choice of a liquid. Water is not an irritantor diuretic and will not interfere with diabeticcontrol. If swallowing problems exist, nectarsand thick liquids such as buttermilk and V-8juice are acceptable if a mild thickened liquid isneeded, according to Cardinal Hill Rehabilita-tion Hospital. Any liquid may be thickenedwith commercial products or by mixing it withnatural thickeners such as baby food, mashedbananas, or wheat germ (Kain, 2001). Hydration status should be evaluated on an ongoing basis. A color chart, developed andtested by Armstrong (1998), may be particu-larly helpful in teaching patients and/or care-givers a simple way to self-monitor adequacy offluid intake. (The color chart is available in theArmstrong text (2000), Performing in Extreme Environments , or may be obtained with the Evidence-Based Hydration Management Proto-col from the University of Iowa.) Maintaining bowel regularity prevents the potential interference with bladder emptyingthat may result from constipation and promotesfecal continence. Irregular bowel habits, immo-bility, dehydration, decreased fiber intake, andemotional factors contribute to the developmentof constipation. Many hospitalized patientsidentify the lack of privacy and change in dailyroutines as major factors in their constipation.Planning a set time for defecation consistentwith a patient's usual routine had the greatestefficiency and effectiveness for bowel trainingUrinary Incontinence 513 after stroke when compared in an evaluation ofbowel programs differing in the time of dayscheduled for bowel training and use of suppos-itories (Venn, Taft, Carpentier, & Applebaugh,1992). Maintaining hydration is critical in pro-moting bowel function as well as bladder activ-ity and has been discussed. The addition of fiberwith adequate fluids should be considered ifstools are hard. A mild stimulant such as prunesor prune juice 6-8 hours prior to planned defe-cation may be indicated for hard stool that isdifficult to pass. A mixture of applesauce, prunejuice, and bran has been effective in decreasingconstipation and for laxative use in nursinghome patients (Smith & Newman, 1989), andhas application in the treatment and preventionof constipation in at-risk patients (see Table 12-9). Its thick texture may facilitate adminis- tration to patients with swallowing problems.The use of regular grocery store items to preparethe mixture should decrease the overall cost ofthe bowel program when compared to prescrip-tion or over-the-counter products. Prompted voiding (PV), an intervention to treat a patient's inability to recognize and act on Table 12-9 Bran Mixture Recipe for Treating or Preventing Constipation 1 c. applesauce1 c. unprocessed coarse wheat bran 1/2c. unsweetened prune juice Mix together.

Refrigerate the recipe.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 513 514 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems the sensation of the need to void and exertneuromuscular control over initiation of void-ing, has been successful in decreasing the fre-quency of UI in clinical trials with physicallyand cognitively impaired nursing home resi-dents (Colling et al., 1996;McCormick et al., 1990; Schnelle, 1990). It alsohas been shown to be effective in home settings(Adkins & Matthews, 1997). Persons with urge,stress, and mixed UI have responded positivelyto this intervention (Ouslander et al., 1995;Schnelle, 1990). Prompted voiding also hasstrong support for reducing UI in individualswith cognitive and physical deficits (Abrams,Khoury, & Wein, 1999; Fantl et al., 1996;Heavener, 1998). Prompted voiding is a scheduling regimen that initially focuses on the caregiver's behav-ior in order to change the incontinent person'svoiding behavior. PV involves the consistent use of three caregiver behaviors: monitoring,prompting, and praising. The caregiver adheresto a schedule of regular monitoring, asking theincontinent individual if he or she needs to usethe toilet, and checking to see if he or she is dryor wet. Prompting involves reminding them touse the toilet and to wait until the caregiverreturns to void. Praise is the positive response orfeedback for appropriate toileting or dryness.See Table 12-10 for the steps of the prompted voiding technique and associated caregiverbehaviors. Research evaluating the effectiveness of PV provides clues about the predictors of successand factors in responsiveness. The best predic-tor of an individual's likelihood to benefit is heror his success during a therapeutic trial (usuallylasting 3 days) (Lyons & Specht, 1999; Ous-lander et al., 1995). A prompted voiding trialinvolves assessing the patient's ability to recog- Table 12-10 Steps in the Prompted Voiding Protocol 1. Greet the patient by name.

Managing Urinary Incontinence in the York: Springer Publication.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 514 nize the need to void and to respond to the needappropriately, either by asking to toilet or agree-ing to toilet when the bladder is full. If thepatient's percentage of appropriate toileting(number of voids in receptacle divided by totalnumber of voids) meets the proportion specified,PV is continued. Although patients are usuallychecked every 2 hours initially, the pattern andvolume of voids recorded guide the intervalbetween voids and determine when the intervalis changed. The reader is referred to Schnelle's(1991) text, Managing Urinary Incontinence in the Elderly , and the University of Iowa's research- based protocol, Prompted Voiding for Persons with Urinary Incontinence (Lyons & Specht, 1999) for an in-depth description of the PV protocol, sug-gestions for implementation, and forms for doc-umentation. Factors possibly related to lack ofsuccess with PV include increased age, highresidual urine volumes, low maximum voidedvolume, and a high frequency of incidents inwhich the person indicates the need to void anddoes not void (Lyons & Specht, 1999). Bladder training focuses on the ability to delay urination and suppress urgency and is animportant component for continence. Bladdertraining refers to a program of education, sched-uled voiding, and reinforcement to providepatients with the skills to improve the ability tocontrol urgency, decrease frequency and incon-tinent episodes, and prolong the intervalbetween voiding (Wyman, 1994b). The steps in a bladder training program include setting a voiding schedule, teachingstrategies for controlling urgency, monitoringvoiding, and positive reinforcement. The initialvoiding schedule is determined from baselinevoiding data and prescribed according to theguidelines presented in Table 12-11 . A 5- to 10-minute window on either side of the sched-uled voiding time is allowed for flexibility. Thetraining regimen is followed during wakinghours, and the time between voiding is gradu-ally increased by 15-30 minutes until the goalinterval between voiding is reached (Sampselleet al., 1997). Although a 3-4 hour voidinginterval is considered a maximal goal, Wymanand Fantl (1991) report most patients best tol-erate an interval of 2-2 1/2hours. Strategies to suppress urge include relaxation and distractiontechniques such as slow deep breathing, con-centrating on a task such as talking to someone,and pelvic muscle contractions. Bladder training has been evaluated and implemented primarily with independent,community-dwelling elderly women. Personswith physical and cognitive impairment havebeen considered unlikely candidates for bladdertraining techniques. However, the potentialbenefit to voiding supports an effort to try thisapproach. A review of the literature on demen-tia and incontinence reported mobility was animportant factor in the incidence of inconti-nence in persons with dementia (Snelley &Flint, 1995). An exercise program to improvewalking in cognitively impaired nursing home residents reduced daytime incontinence(Jivorec, 1991). Providing patients the skills todelay voiding until mobility improves or untilassistance for toileting can be obtained is a miss-ing element that may decrease incontinenceregardless of the level of recovery of mobility. Another technique is pelvic muscle rehabil- itation , which concentrates on increasing the strength, tone, and control of the pelvic floor mus-cles to facilitate a person's ability to voluntarilycontrol the flow of urine and suppress urgency.The pelvic floor muscles support the pelvicorgans. Pelvic muscle rehabilitation refers to anexercise regimen to improve the integrity andUrinary Incontinence 51528438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 515 516 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems function of the pelvic floor. The proposed mecha-nism of action for pelvic muscle training is thatstrong and fast pelvic muscle contractions closethe urethra and increase urethral pressure to pre-vent leakage. Pelvic muscle contractions mayinhibit bladder contractions, helping to suppressurgency. To teach the individual to identify andisolate the correct muscles, instruct him or her to\"draw in\" and \"lift up\" the sphinctermuscles. Patients should be instructed to lift upthe perivaginal muscles and avoid contracting theabdominal, gluteal, and thigh muscles. To helpTable 12-11 Steps in Bladder Training 1. Complete a 72-hour voiding diary.2. Review the voiding diary. Calculate the number of voids and bladder accidents in a 24-hour period. Determine fluid intake. 3. Examine data for patterns. Does UI occur only during certain times of day? Are accidents associated with certain events (activities, intake of specific type of fluids, medications)? What isthe average time between voids and longest interval? Are behaviors different for weekdays orweekends or workdays vs. nonworkdays or time when you are at home or out of the home? 4. Establish an initial voiding interval and consider the optimal interval to be achieved. The typical interval for adults is every 4 hours during the day; however, data suggest for older persons every 2hours may be optimum (Wyman & Fantyl, 1991). The objective is to start the voiding routine atthe interval that is comfortable to separate urgency from voiding; then, as you develop urgesuppression skills, to increase the time between voiding until the goal is reached. 5. Urinate when you wake after meals, before bedtime, and at the prescribed intervals.6. If you get the urge to void and it is too soon to void, use the relaxation technique to make the urge go away. Remember, this involves taking very slow deep breaths until the urge goes away. Relaxand concentrate when doing this. Contract the pelvic floor muscles quickly 3-5 times. Relax.Contract again. 7. Void at the prescribed time even if you don't feel the need.8. If after a week it is very easy to wait the assigned time interval, lengthen the time by 15-30 minutes.9. Begin by only practicing this technique at home, when you are relaxed and the bathroom is nearby. 10. Fluid intake should be kept at six 8-ounce glasses per day. If you awaken frequently during the night to void, drink the majority of your 8 ounces before 6 at night . Hints to remember: Do not go to the bathroom before you have the urge to void.Never rush or run to the bathroom\u2014walk slowly. Use the relaxation technique in situations that cause you to have the urge to void before the assigned time interval. For example, if you get the urge to void whenever you start to unlockyour front door, stop, relax, and take three slow deep breaths to let the urge pass. Then unlockthe door and walk slowly to the bathroom. When you walk slowly to the bathroom, do some pelvic muscle exercises to prevent an accident. 11. Do not despair and get discouraged. In time, this will all fall into place and you will be voiding at the set time interval.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 516 Biofeedback is an adjunct to pelvic muscle rehabilitation and bladder contraction inhibi-tion that has strong scientific support foreffectiveness with stress and urge urinary incon-tinence (Abrams, Khoury, & Wein, 1999; Fantlet al., 1996). In a summary paper on the use ofbiofeedback-assisted bladder training for urgeand stress incontinence, Burgio (1990) con-cluded this option has particular advantages inthat it is very low risk and has had no docu-mented side effects; however, because it relies onlearning new behaviors, it may have limitedapplication in patients with cognitive impair-ment. Much of the initial research evaluated theeffectiveness of interventions with cognitivelyintact, community-dwelling elderly. However,there is compelling evidence supporting theextension of research to a more cognitivelyimpaired population. Recent studies targeting a more vulnerable population, the homebound frail elderly, reportbehavioral approaches were effective in reducingUI (Bear, Dwyer, Benveneste, Jeff, & Dougherty,1997; Engeberg, McDowell, Donovan, Brodak,& Weber, 1997). A pilot study regarding theeffect of pelvic muscle exercise and promptedvoiding on the frequency of UI in elderly cogni-tively impaired nursing home residents revealedsubjects showed significant reduction in incon-tinence with the addition of pelvic muscle exer-cise (PME) to a prompted voiding regimen(Scheve, Engel, McCormick, & Leahy, 1991). The importance of ensuring patients can appropriately and adequately perform PME can-not be overemphasized. Bump, Hurt, Fantl, andWyman (1991) found that verbal instructionswere often not sufficient for incontinent womenseen in an outpatient program to perform PME.Biofeedback, either through surface electrodesor vaginal or rectal probes, provides visualand/or auditory cues to facilitate incontinentUrinary Incontinence 517 the patient avoid a bearing down motion, havehim or her practice pushing down to feel what notto do. Start with contracting for two seconds, andthen gradually increase the length of the contrac-tion until a maximum 10-second hold is achieved.A repetition includes relaxing or resting the pelvicfloor muscles between contractions for the sameamount of time the muscle is being contracted. Atypical training regimen involves 10 repetitionstwo to three times a day. Once the correct tech-nique has been learned, instruct the patient to usepelvic muscle contraction to prevent urine flow. Ifleakage occurs with activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, then a muscle contractionshould precede the activity. If urgency is the pri-mary problem, the pelvic floor muscles are usedto suppress the urge. The urge suppression tech- nique is outlined in Table 12-12 . Table 12-12 Urge Suppression Techniques Stop what you are doing and stay put. Sit down when possible, or stand quietly.Remain very still. When you are still, it iseasier to control your urge. Squeeze your pelvic floor muscles quickly several times. Do not relax fully in between. Relax the rest of your body. Take a few deep breaths to help you relax and let go of yourtension. Concentrate on suppressing the urge feeling. Wait until the urge subsides. Walk to the bathroom at a normal pace. Do not rush. Continue squeezing your pelvic floor muscles quickly while you walk.

It also helps decrease patients'tendency to use abdominal or gluteal muscles.In the absence of biofeedback equipment, digi-tal checks can be used to teach and monitorongoing performance. The Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA) analyzed scientific data related to the use ofbiofeedback for treatment of stress, urge, andpost-prostatectomy incontinence in a recentreview of the Medicare coverage policy. A deci-sion memorandum summarizing its findingsand the recommendations of numerous profes-sional organizations amended HCFA's policy toallow coverage for biofeedback with patientswho had failed documented trials of pelvic mus-cle exercises or who are unable to perform PME(Tunis, Norris, & Simon, 2000). A failed trialis defined as no significant improvement aftercompleting a 4-week period of structured,ordered pelvic muscle reeducation to increasepelvic floor strength (Norris, 2001). Pelvic floor electrical stimulation (PFES) is another adjunct to PME. PFES refers to theapplication of electric current to afferent fibers via nonimplantablevaginal or anal probes (Fantl et al., 1996).Variable rates of current are used to improve ure-thral closure by activating pelvic floor muscles,thus exercising and strengthening the pelvicfloor (Tunis, Whyte, & Bridger, 2000). PFESalso can facilitate an ability to iden-tify and isolate pelvic floor musculature. TheAgency for Health Care Policy and Research(AHCPR) (Fantl et al., 1996) guidelines con-clude that fair research-based evidence existsthat PFES decreases stress urinary incontinencein women and it may be useful for urge andmixed incontinence. The HCFA review panelconcluded that PFES is effective for patientswith stress and/or urge incontinence, and con-siders its use as necessary and reasonable if PMEshave been unsuccessful (Tunis, Whyte, &Bridger, 2000). However, the ability to passivelyexercise the pelvic floor makes this a potentiallyvaluable treatment for individuals unable to per-form the exercises. Pharmacological ManagementMedications are available to help treat stress andurge incontinence. Because many older personshave multiple chronic health problems, med-ications for incontinence should be consideredprimarily as an adjunct to other behavioralinterventions. Pharmacological management ofurge urinary incontinence was found to add tothe effectiveness of behavioral strategies in frailolder persons (Fonda et al., 2002). However, thepotential for adverse reactions and added costmust be considered carefully with the patientwhen decisions for a pharmacological interven-tion are being considered. Medications prescribed for stress urinary incontinence have targeted the internal urinarysphincter or the urethral/vaginal tissues. Thealpha agonist pseudoephedrine acts at the blad-der neck, increasing urethral tone, and it maydecrease leakage. It is often prescribed for mildcases of stress urinary incontinence; however, itsside effects of insomnia, restlessness, nervous-ness, headache, and potential to increase bloodpressure and heart rate limit its usefulness in review by the Food and Drug Adminis-tration for treating stress urinary incontinence.Estrogen, prescribed to treat urogenital 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 518 Evidence of its usefulness in stress UI is incon-clusive (Fantl et al., 1996). However, estrogen'seffectiveness in treating atrophic tissues can helpalleviate irritative symptoms of urgency, whichmay decrease urge UI. Drug therapy for urge incontinence has grown over the last few years with new productson the horizon. The primary agents for unin-hibited bladder contractions are anticholinergicor antispasmotics that decrease contraction ofthe detrusor muscle. Table 12-13 presents an overview of the medications used for urge uri-nary incontinence. Overflow incontinence in men that is the result of bladder neck obstruction from benignprostatic hypertrophy (BPH) may resolve withtreatment of and terazosin) relax theurinary sphincters, improving urine flow anddecreasing urine retention and overflow incon-tinence. However, dizziness and orthostatichypotension are potential side effects that mustbe addressed. Another option for BPH treat-ment are the 5- /H9251reductase inhibitors finesteride and dutasteride. This class of medications blocksthe conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestos-terone, the form needed for prostate growth.The 5- /H9251reductase inhibitors take about 3 to 6 months to take effect. An important considera-tion in the prescription and administration ofthese drugs is their teratogenic effects. Devices and ProductsOne of the first decisions made in the manage-ment of UI is the choice of protective undergar-ments. A variety of absorbent products are nowavailable to contain urine. It is important thatpatients use products designed for urine; men-strual pads, a popular choice, are not specificallydesigned to absorb and contain urine. Theabsorbent inner core of continence garmentswicks the urine away from the skin and allowsurine to spread throughout the entire pad,increasing the volume of urine absorbed(Newman, 2002). The volume of urine thatneeds to be contained and the need for help toi-leting are important considerations in productselection. The use of pad and pant sets devel-oped for men and for women offers severaladvantages to the traditional adult diaper. Thesegarments are easier to manipulate to prepare fortoileting and for repositioning clothing after-wards. They also are more in line with usual or \"normal\" underclothes, facilitating the expec-tation of a return to continence and promot-ing comfort. The introduction of products toaccommodate moderate to heavy levels of incon-tinence has broadened the possibilities for suc-cessful containment. Many patients and familyhave been relieved (especially from an economicperspective) to learn of the availability of non-disposable garments that can be washed andreused. New and improved products are in the plan- ning and production stages (Mueller, 2004) andwill increase the options for management anddecrease the control that incontinence and thefear of incontinence exerts over an individual'slife. Toileting equipment and collection devicesare available for men and women to promoteself-toileting, including female urinals, wheel-chair urinals, and male reusable urinal/pantgarments.

Moisture barriersand no-rinse incontinence cleansers have beenshown to be more effective than soap and wateralone in preventing skin breakdown (Byers,Ryan, Regan, Shields, & Carta, 1995). It isimportant to gently dry the skin after cleaningand apply moisturizers. Petroleum-based prod-ucts may be incompatible with some adultbriefs, causing skin irritation (Newman, 2002). Indwelling urinary catheters, once the pri- mary means for managing urinary incontinence,are no longer accepted as the first step in anincontinence treatment regimen. However,there are situations that may require catheteruse. The Agency for Health Care Policy andResearch identified guidelines for long-termindwelling catheter use (see Table 12-14 ). With long-term use, care must be taken tomonitor for common complications of polymi-crobial bacteruria (universal by 30 days), fever(1 event per 100 patient days), nephroliathisis,bladder stones, epididymitis, and chronic renalinflammation and pyelonephritis (Fonda et al.,2002). Maintaining hydration, urine flow, andcleanliness of the system are important compo-nents of care.

Emptying the catheter every 4-6hours to avoid migration of bacteria up thelumen, cleaning the insertion site gently withsoap and water daily, and avoiding irrigationsmay help decrease symptomatic urinary tractinfection. Whenever a patient's status changes,such as when pressure ulcers heal or caregiversare available, then a trial without the indwel-ling catheter should be considered. Intermittent urinary catheterization is another supportive measure to manage urinary retention(Fantl et al., 1996). In and out catheterizationallows regular bladder emptying. Regular emp-tying reduces pressure within the bladder andimproves circulation to the bladder wall, mak-ing the mucosa more resistant to infection(Newman, 2002). Sterile technique (ISC) is usedin institutions, and clean technique (ICC) isused for catheterizations at home. No studieshave been conducted comparing the use of inter-mittent urinary catheterization and long-termindwelling urinary catheterization in the frailelderly (Fonda et al., 2002). Dexterity andmobility problems may interfere with self-catheterizations. Comfort with intermittentcatheterizations is a factor in ISC and ICC per-formed by caregivers. Urinary incontinence is a serious, potentially disabling, complication. Incontinence is a com-mon condition in the older population. Theintroduction of early targeted behavioral inter-ventions should improve urological functioningand limit the impact of uncontrolled inconti-nence on quality of life. Older patients and theircaregivers must be provided the skills\u2014bothtechnical and intellectual\u2014to prevent the de-velopment and persistence of elimination prob-lems. These skills are important components inthe treatment of sleep problems precipitated byvoiding problems. Sleep Disorders Sleep is considered a time of restoration for ourbodies and minds. Sleep is necessary to healwounds, maintain normal hormonal function,and provide sound emotional health. Disrup-tions in sleep of the older adult can worsenchronic illnesses and exacerbate depression. It isnecessary for the nurse to understand the normalchanges of sleep patterns in the older adult andrecognize sleep abnormalities that can nega-tively impact health. Sleep Changes Associated with Aging A sleep cycle consists of two distinct compo-nents, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . NREM is composed of four stages, beginningwith Stage I, which is a transitional period ofvery light sleep. The individual is easily arousedduring this stage and may deny having beenasleep. Stage I usually lasts less than 7 minutes.This is followed by stage II, a period of deeperrelaxation and light sleep. Stage II is the mostpredominant NREM stage in older adults.Stages III and IV are deeper, more restorativeperiods of sleep. During these stages, there is adecrease in pulse, blood pressure, and metabo-lism. Stage IV restores the individual physically,and tissue healing occurs during this time.However, Stage IV is the most sensitive toadvancing age and begins to decrease during thethird decade of life (Honkus, 2003). 28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 524 Sleep Disorders 525 REM sleep follows the four stages of NREM, and during REM the body is in the deepest stateof relaxation. Large muscles become immobileand the individual is unable to move. However,the autonomic nervous system is very active, andrespiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart ratebecome erratic and frequently elevated. Brainwave activity patterns are similar to those ofwakefulness (Hoffman, 2003). REM sleep is thestage of sleep in which dreams occur. It isthought that REM is a time of mental and emo-tional restoration. The sleep cycle, usually about 90 minutes long, begins with NREM I, then progressesthrough NREM II-IV . The individual mayreturn to NREM III and II, then begin REMsleep. After REM sleep, the sleep patternreturns to Stage II. The smallest amount ofREM occurs during early cycles and increaseswith each subsequent cycle through the night.This cycle repeats throughout the night, and thetime spent in each stage varies, depending onthe individual's age and other factors. When aperson is awakened, the sleep cycle alwaysreturns to Stage I, and the process begins allover again. Therefore, individuals who awakenfrequently spend much less time in the restora-tive phases of sleep. The older adult spends more time in Stage II, takes longer to fall asleep, and is awakened moreeasily. Sleep can be significantly disrupted inindividuals with cardiovascular disease, stroke,endocrine disorders, depression, and Alzheimerand Parkinson's diseases. Recent research revealsthat prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to car-diovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune sys-tem disorders. The circadian rhythm that regulates sleep is governed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)in the hypothalamus. The SCN responds totransmissions from photoreceptors in the retinathat travel along the optic nerve. Most individ-uals' biological clocks are on an innate 25-hourcycle. Sunlight or other bright light resets theSCN and our circadian rhythm follows the 24-hour cycle of the sun instead of the innate cycle(Medical College of Wisconsin, 1999). Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland at night. It is released in responseto darkness and inhibits neurotransmittersinvolved in arousal. Individuals who are exposedto bright lights 24 hours a day can experience atotal cessation of melatonin release, and subse-quent disruption of the sleep cycle. This lack ofsleep can lead to delirium in the older adult. Itis important that nurses pay close attention tothe client's nighttime environment, and turn offthe lights. Prevalence of SleepDisturbances Sleep difficulties become more prevalent withage. According to the National Sleep Founda-tion's 2003 Sleep In America poll, 26% of adultsaged 44-65 and 21% of adults over the age of 65rated their sleep as fair or poor. Common sleepcomplaints in the older adult include frequentawakenings during the night, early morningawakenings, and difficulties falling asleep atnight ( Table 12-15 ). Those with chronic ill- nesses tend to have a greater propensity for sleepdisturbances. Nearly 80% of men and womenover the age of 70 have at least one chronic dis-ease, and those with four or more comorbid con-ditions are considerably more likely to have sleepdisturbances. Individuals with multiple illnessesrate their sleep as being of poorer quality. Theysleep less hours, awaken more frequently, reportdifficulty falling asleep, awaken earlier, and28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 525 526 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems report more significant daytime sleepiness thanthose with three or fewer medical conditions.The conditions that negatively impact sleepinclude hypertension, cardiovascular disease,arthritis, diabetes, cancer, stroke, depression,osteoporosis, and respiratory diseases (NationalSleep Foundation, 2003).InsomniaInsomnia , or difficulty falling and staying asleep, is more prominent in women. Geneticand environmental factors contribute to insom-nia. First-degree relatives of insomniacs have anincreased frequency of the disorder. Noise andunfavorable room temperature can contribute to insomnia (Asplund, 1999). Treatment mayinclude benzodiazepines, hypnotics, or anti-depressants.Sleep cessation are the hallmarkof sleep apnea , and snoring may be present in the individual with this disorder. Sleep apneacan be caused by a central nervous system con-trol mechanism disturbance (central sleep apnea,CSA) or by the narrowing or loss of tone in thepharyngeal airway (obstructive sleep apnea,OSA). During these episodes of apnea, the softstructures of the throat relax and the airway isclosed off. Oxygen levels decrease, carbon diox-ide increases, and the blood becomes moreacidic. The heart rate drops and the brain erro-neously interprets the changes as a fluid over-load. Hormones are released that awaken theindividual and signal the body to get rid of fluidand sodium. Other symptoms usually presentwith apnea include snoring, restless sleep, andmorning headaches. Both forms can result insevere sleep fragmentation, significant daytimesleepiness that interferes with daily life, and anincrease in the incidence of several diseases(Asplund, 1999). Consequences of sleep apnea include hyper- tension, coronary artery disease, myocardialinfarction, pulmonary hypertension, CHF,stroke, neuropsychiatric problems, cognitiveimpairment, sexual dysfunction, and injury dueto accidents (National Commission on SleepDisorders Research, 1993). Even amonghealthy adults, a higher risk of death exists inTable 12-15 Sleep Problems in the Older Adult Condition Description/Significance IncidenceSleep disorders\u2014combined Insomnia, snoring, breathing pauses, or years 64% Insomnia asleep or staying asleep, 55-84 years old: 48% waking up early or unrefreshed Snoring Symptom of sleep apnea 55-84 years old: 32%Breathing pauses Symptom of or 55-84 years old: 7% experienced Tingling and discomfort Symptom of restless leg syndrome 55-84 years old: 17% in legs Source: Adapted from Sleep American Poll 2003, National Sleep Foundation.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 526 those with longer sleep latencies and poorersleep quality (Ryff, Singer, & Love, 2004).Nearly 60% of individuals with cardiac diseasealso have sleep apnea (Anderson, 2004).Patients with sleep apnea have twice the risk ofhypertension, three times the risk of coronaryartery disease, and a four-fold risk of strokewhen compared to national disease prevalence(Chasens, Weaver, & Umlauf, 2003). There isevidence that chronic partial sleep loss, such asdelayed onset or frequent awakenings, is moredetrimental than short-term total sleep depri-vation (Bryant, Trinder, & Curtis, 2004). Poorsleep has been linked to poor memory and workperformance, compromised interpersonal rela-tionships, and a diminished quality of life(Cheek, Shaver, & Lentz, 2004). Patients withCHF and untreated sleep apnea consume twicethe health care resources as patients with CHFwho seek treatment for sleep apnea (Anderson).Sleep loss has been shown to have a signifi-cantly negative impact on memory retention ofnew skills, such as those learned in the occupa-tional therapy sessions during rehabilitation(DeGroot, Eskes, & Phillips, 2003; Ficca &Salzarulo, 2004). Individuals who exhibitsymptoms of sleep apnea should be referred toa sleep center for polysomnography, anovernight evaluation of sleep events. Continu-ous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devicesconsistently improve the symptoms of sleepapnea and decrease the individual's risk ofdeveloping somatic disease. Restless Leg SyndromeIndividuals with restless leg syndrome expe- rience periodic leg movements during sleep.The most effective method of resolving restlessleg movements is to get out of bed and walkaround. However, this can significantly disruptsleep. Pharmacological treatment of the syn-drome includes dopaminergic drugs, dopamineagonists, and benzodiazepines (Asplund, 1999). developed sleepinessscale sleepiness uncontaminated byemotional state or pain (Maldonado, Bentley, &Mitchell, 2004). The scale requires the client topoint to a picture that most represents their per-ceived level of sleepiness. The pictorial scale hasshown validity and reliability in assessing levelof sleepiness in sleep-disordered adults, youngschool-aged children, and adults with low liter-acy levels. The Epworth scale is a self-completion report of the likelihood of the patient falling asleep dur-ing several daytime activities (Johns, 1991).Ratings are made on a 0-3 scale (0 /H11005never, 3 /H11005 a high chance), with an overall score range of0-24. The Epworth scale can be used to deter-mine if sleep interferences and frequent awaken-ings have an impact on daytime sleepiness,which can negatively impact performance andrecall of newly learned skills (Ersser et al., 1999). Daytime sleepiness is a direct result of sleep quality. However, many sleep problems can bea result of poor sleep hygiene, which is the mea-sures an individual takes to promote sleep.Therefore, it is important to also measure theclient's sleep habits, such as time of going tobed, rituals prior to bedtime, and establishedsleep environment. Sleep hygiene should beassessed as well as daytime sleepiness, depres-sion, and anxiety, and a thorough physical exam-ination and medication history should becompleted. Many medications can interfere withsleep, and drug-drug interactions can be a con-tributing factor to sleep disruption. The Epworth Sleepiness and pictorial scales are valid in differentiating sleepiness and sleepquality without influence of pain or mood state.Sleep Disorders 52728438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 527 528 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems The pictorial scale is appropriate for clients whoare unable to read, including children andclients with decreased cognition. This sleephygiene assessment measures difficulty fallingand staying asleep, daytime somnolence, andindividual satisfaction with sleep. Medicationsthat are used to induce sleep include benzodi-azepines such as triazolam (Halcion), for Care Nursing therapeutics sleep promotioninclude enhanced sleep hygiene (Cheek, Shaver,& Lentz, 2004; Hoffman, 2003), and herbs, (Buckle, 2001; 2004;Taibi, Nagel, Markie,Elwell, & Barone, 2003). Individuals who havedelayed sleep onset tend to respond better tonursing interventions than those with sleepmaintenance problems. Sleep maintenance dis-orders, or frequent disruptions after fallingasleep due to somatic abnormalities, usuallyrespond better to medical therapy, includingCPAP and treatment of underlying causes.Sleep HygieneClients admitted to the hospital have illness andenvironment-related disruptions to their sleep.Nursing interventions, including medicationadministration, taking vital signs, and com-pleting assessments, should be timed to allowlong periods of uninterrupted sleep wheneverpossible. If a client must be awakened, observefor rapid eye movements. If the client is in astate of REM sleep, wait until he or she is expe-riencing an NREM cycle of sleep to awaken(Honkus, 2003) Caffeine avoidance is an important measure to enhance sleep. The stimulant increases phys-iological arousal and prevents the onset of sleep.Caffeine has a half-life of 3-7 hours, and lateafternoon to evening abstinence is recom-mended to avoid its invigorating effect. Alcoholcan expedite sleep onset, but interrupts REMand non-REM sleep throughout night. Afteralcohol arousal occursthat can precipitate early morning awakening.The effect can last for several nights based on theindividual's metabolism. Smoking also increasesawake time and causes a delayed sleep onset(Cheek, Shaver, & Lentz, 2004). A consistent retiring and awakening time strengthens the circadian rhythm through ahomeostatic mechanism and a habitual light-dark cycle exposure. Getting up at the sametime each day is more important in establishingsynchronization with the light-dark cycle thangoing to bed at the same time (Cheek et al.,2003; Hoffman, 2003). Environmental RestructuringFlorence Nightingale was one of the first toaddress environmental restructuring for improvedpatient outcomes. She considered lighting,noise, and sensory stimulation as care aspectsthat could enhance or hinder recovery. Lightsshould be on during the day and off at night totrigger the normal sleep pattern. Fluorescentlight tends to be harsh and can cause visualfatigue and headaches. Natural light through awindow can help maintain the circadianrhythm. During a 1975 study of a windowlessintensive care unit in Great Britain, the inci-28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 528 dence of patient delirium was twice as high asin a unit with windows. Artificial light exposureduring the night causes a drop in melatoninlevels after 20 minutes, and constant, high-intensity light can lead to a total cessation ofmelatonin production. The colors used in theenvironment also play a role in the sleep cycle.Nightingale also incorporated color as a thera-peutic tool by using flowers. Room colors thatpromote sleep are soft mixed tones of blue,green, and violet without sharp contrasts.Artwork of nature scenes can decrease use ofpain medication, lower blood pressure, andincrease the perception of relaxation (Fontaineet al., 2001). Environmental noise can activate the sympa- thetic nervous system during sleep. Sleep occursbest at noise levels below 35 decibels, and levelsabove 80 db are related to sleep arousals. Tele-vision and talking were the two most frequent dis-ruptive sounds reported in a questionnaire of 203ICU patients (Fontaine et al., 2001). Environ-mental \"white noise\" such as ocean or rain soundsor repetitive tones at 800 Hz tend to enhancesleep (Richards, 1996). Patients with sleep-onsetdifficulties respond better to relaxation techniquesand stimulus control than do those with sleep-maintenance problems (Mantle, 1996). RelaxationMusic therapy promotes relaxation, deceasesanxiety and pain perception, improves sleepquality, and decreases heart rate and systolicpressure (Fontaine et al., 2001; Richards, 1996).Johnson (2003) studied the impact of musictherapy on the sleep quality of 52 female par-ticipants. Subjects selected their own preferenceof music with 64% selecting soothing classicalmusic, 19% selecting sacred music, and 10%selecting new age music. Sleep Disorders 529 Each morning, subjects recorded the length of time it took to fall asleep, the number ofawakenings, the time they awoke in the morn-ing, and their satisfaction with the night's sleep.Subjects took less time to fall asleep, awoke lessoften, and reported a quicker return to sleepafter awakening. Satisfaction with sleep scoressignificantly increased. The music therapybecame more effective with each consecutivenight's use, and a peak effect was reached on thefifth day that was maintained thereafter for thestudy's 10-night course (Johnson, 2003). Musictherapy is the most common independent nurs-ing intervention used for sleep. It elicits therelaxation response, decreases nervoussystem arousal, stimulates alpha waves, andtriggers endorphin release (Gagner-Tjellesenet al., 2001). In a systematic review of 22 research articles, Richards, Gibson, and Overton-McCoy (2000)found positive results of massage in sessions asshort as 1-2 minutes. Physiologic responses tomassage include decreases in heart rate, bloodpressure, catecholamine and cortisol production,and muscle activity. Patients with fibromyalgiareported lower anxiety and depression, less painand stiffness, and fewer difficulties falling asleep(Richards et al.). Field (1998) reported similarresults in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Patients in the massage group slept an averageof 1 hour longer than those in the control group.A 3-minute effleurage massage can decreaseautonomic arousal and cardiac load in clientswith cardiovascular disorders (Gauthier, 1999). AromatherapyAromatherapy oils such as lavender, chamomile,lemon, peppermint, thyme, geranium, and euca-lyptus have been reported to enhance immunityand promote relaxation. Poor industry control28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 529 530 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems and lack of standardization are safety concerns.The potential for allergic reactions also exists inpatients who are taking multiple medications.Therefore, caution should be used when recom-mending aromatherapy in this patient population(Fontaine et al., 2001; Richards, et al., 2003). Lavender oil has a calming effect and decreases insomnia. In a study of elderly individuals withsleep disturbance, lavender was as effective astranquilizers (Oliff, 2004). True lavender (lavan-dula angustiflora) produces a sedative effect thatis similar to benzodiazepines. It is considered thesafest of all essential oils with no irritation or sen-sitivity reported at dilutions as high as 16% andno toxicity ever reported (Buckle, 2001). Whenlavender is inhaled (one to five drops on a tissueinhaled for 10 minutes), the molecules travel tothe olfactory bulb and then to the limbic systemwhere GABA is increased in a response similar tothat of diazepam ingestion (Buckle). Herbal TherapyConsumers of herbal products are advised tocheck with the American Herbal ProductsAssociation to ascertain the credibility of man-ufacturers and safety of compounds. This infor-mation is available at http://www.ahpa.org/companies.htm (Taibi et al., 2004). Herbalpreparations containing valerian have shownpromising results in patients with autoimmuneand cardiovascular conditions (Bourguignonet al., 2003; Taibi et al.). Valerian is a rootextract that enhances by influencing activ-ity at GABA, adenosine, and serotonin receptors,which regulate normal et al.). Recentfindings suggest that valerian promotes relax-ation and increases the depth and quality ofsleep. Valerian reduced objective and subjectivesleep latency, improved sleep efficiency, anddecreased awakenings in patients with rheuma-toid arthritis when compared to placebo. Vale-rian may also have analgesic and spasmolyticproperties that reduce pain (Bourguignon,2003). Valerian does not produce the \"hangover\"effect similar to that of benzodiazepines. In areview of 28 clinical trials, there were noreported adverse effects of valerian (Taibi et al.).However, drug-drug interactions includinghepatotoxicity can occur with valerian, and theherb should be used with caution in older adults. Pressure Ulcers Prevalence A pressure ulcer is a lesion caused by unrelieved pressure with damage to the underlying tissue.Pressure ulcers have significant prevalence inolder adults in the acute care setting (3%-11%),long-term facilities (24%), and the community(17%). When a stage I ulcer develops, the olderadult has a tenfold risk of developing furtherulcers (Dhamarajan & Ahmed, 2003). The nor-mal skin changes associated with aging, com-bined with the effects of illness, contribute to thehigher risk of ulcer development in the olderpopulation. Skin becomes thinner, has less colla-gen and moisture, and can lose the ability to pro-tect itself against invading organisms. Blood flowto the dermis is reduced, which results in fewernutrients reaching the skin and less wasteremoval. Because of this, the skin takes muchlonger to heal. The older adult's skin is also moresusceptible to friction and shear injuries. Implications/Relevance ofPressure Ulcers The most significant contributor to pressureulcer formation is the ischemia caused by unre-28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 530 positions when pressure or friction is concen-trated in an area of the body. However, if a per-son is immobile or has decreased sensation, theischemia persists and pressure ulcers can developin a very short period of time. Assessment Risk assessments should be completed on allpatients; the Braden Scale for Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment (Table 12-16) is the most widely used instrument that determines risk ofpressure ulcer development. The scale assessessensory perception, skin moisture, activity,mobility, nutrition, and friction/shear. Each areais scored on a scale of 1 to 3 or 4, with a possi-ble score of 23 points. The lower the Bradenscore, the higher the risk of pressure ulcer devel-opment (Braden & Bergstrom, 1987). A Bradenscore of 16 or less indicates a high risk of pres-sure ulcer development in the general popula-tion; a score of 18 or less is indicative of highrisk in the older adult or persons with darklypigmented skin. Baseline Braden scores should be determined upon admission to the health care facility and atregular intervals or when the patient's conditionchanges. Hospitals and long-term care facilitiesshould implement nursing care policies thatdetermine the frequency of assessment. Nursing assessment and documentation of pressure ulcers should include staging, measure-ment, exudate description, wound bed charac-teristics, pain, condition of surrounding tissue,and any undermining factors. The NationalPressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) hasdefined the stages of pressure ulcers ( Figure 12-4). Ulcers are staged once, and do not heal in a reverse fashion (for example, a Stage IV ulcerthat heals is not considered a Stage I, but isreferred to as a healed Stage IV ulcer). The heal-Pressure Ulcers 531 lieved pressure. During this time of interruptedblood flow, the skin becomes pale, then hyper-emic and blanchable. Nonblanchable erythemais the result of plasma and erythrocytes leakinginto the skin tissues. Early identification andpressure-relieving interventions can reverse theeffects of ischemia at this point. Once the skinintegrity has been compromised, the patient isat risk for bacteremia, sepsis, osteomyelitis, andcellulitis. Between 1.5 and 3 million people have pres- sure ulcers, and 1 million new cases develop eachyear. In the United States, the cost of medical carefor pressure ulcers is $2.2-$3.6 billion annually.The prevalence of pressure ulcers in the elderlyis 3%-30%, and in critically ill patients,17%-56% (Carlson, Kemp, & Shott, 1999). Warning Signs/Risk Factors forPressure Ulcers Risk factors age, immobility, malnutri-tion, BMI /H1102124, fecal incontinence, diminished level of consciousness, and impaired sensation.External factors that promote pressure ulcerdevelopment are pressure, friction, shearing, andmoisture.

TOTAL SCORE: ing process is described by the Pressure UlcerScale for Healing (PUSH) tool, which is dis-cussed later in the chapter. If an eschar is present, it must be debrided before staging can occur. Prior to debridement(Table 12-17 ), the ulcer should be documented ulcer. Structuresbeneath the epidermis and dermis, includingmuscle, are more susceptible to the effects ofischemia. Therefore, pressure ulcers are usuallymuch worse than they appear on the surface, andstaging should be to the maximum anatomicaldepth after necrotic tissue debridement is per-formed. The structural layers damaged by theischemia are lost, and the defect is filled withgranulation tissue. The length, width, and depth of pressure ulcers should be measured and documented, withdistinction made between healed and nonhealedareas of the ulcer. Photographs are often used todocument the occurrence and healing of pressureulcers. The quantity and characteristics of anyexudates and the types of wound bed tissue(necrotic, slough, granulation) are also docu-mented. Pain related to the pressure ulcer shouldbe assessed using an appropriate pain scale. It isalso important to identify and document effectivepain relief measures and provide analgesia priorto dressing changes or other interventions. The surrounding skin should be assessed for any maceration or injury (including tape abra-sions). The pressure ulcer may have undermin-ing or sinus tracts, and the presence of thesecomplications should be documented. Pressureulcers with undermining or tracts often lead tofurther skin breakdown.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 534 Pressure Ulcers 535 Box 12-18 Preventing Pressure Ulcers 1. Assess all clients for risk of pressure ulcer development.2. Identify all factors of risk to determine specific interventions.3. Inspect the skin at least daily and document results.4. Use mild cleansing agents for bathing, avoiding hot water, harsh soaps, and friction.5. Moisturize after bathing and minimize environmental factors that lead to dry skin.6. Avoid massaging bony prominences.7. Assess for incontinence. Use skin barriers after cleansing, absorbent underpads or briefs, and monitor frequently for episodes of incontinence. 8. Use dry lubricants, such as cornstarch, on transfer surfaces (linens) to prevent friction. 9. Assess for compromised nutrition, particularly protein and caloric intake. Consider nutritional supplements and support for clients at risk. 10. Maintain or improve client's mobility and activity levels.11. Reposition bed-bound clients at least every 2 hours and chair-bound clients every hour. Patients should be instructed or assisted to shift their positions more frequently(i.e., every 15 minutes for chair-bound patients and at least every hour for bed-bound). 12. Place at-risk clients on pressure-reducing devices. (Donut devices should not be used\u2014 they simply displace the pressure and friction to the periphery of the area that is meantto be protected.) 13. Use lifting devices to transfer clients. 14. Pillows or foam wedges should be used to keep bony prominences from direct contact with each other (e.g., knees, ankles). 15. Avoid positioning the client on the trochanter when lying on his or her side. (Use a 30- degree lateral inclined position.) 16. Elevate the head of the bed at 30 degrees or less. (Shearing injuries can occur at eleva- tions higher than 30 degrees.) 17. Evaluate and document the effectiveness of interventions, and modify the plan of care according to client response. 18. Provide education to clients, family, and caregivers for the prevention of pressure ulcers.

Nutrientsinvolved in wound healing include protein, argi-nine, zinc and vitamins A, B, and C (Mathus-Vliegen, 2004; Singer, 2002). If dietary intake isinadequate, nutritional support (tube feeding)should be used to provide approximately 35calories/kg/day and 1.5 grams of protein/kg/day(Mathus-Vliegen). Other identified or suspectednutritional deficiencies should be corrected ifpossible. Tissue Load ManagementTissue load is the distribution of friction, pres-sure, and shear on the tissue. Clients whodevelop pressure ulcers require a decreased loadto the ulcerated area and provision of moisturelevels and temperature that enhance healing.Avoid positioning the client on the pressureFigure 12-4 A pressure ulcer, or decubitus ulcer, develops when pressure compromises blood supply and thus oxygenation to an area of tissue.

The Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) tool (see Table 12-18 ) provides a consistent method of recording the effectiveness of treatment. Thescale has three subscales with a possible score of17. The score will trend downward when treat-ment is effective, and a score of 0 indicates com-plete healing of the pressure ulcer. Prevention of pressure ulcers is dependent upon nursing assessment and early intervention.The cost of ulcers, both in medical expense andhuman suffering, is astronomical and is best pre-vented through aggressive pressure relief meth-ods and nutritional support. Dysphagia Prevalence Dysphagia, or problems with swallowing, is \"an underrecognized, poorly diagnosed andpoorly managed health problem\" that nega-tively impacts the quality and potentially quan-tity of life (Ekberg, Hamby, Woisard, Wuttge-Hanning, & Ortega, 2004, p. 143). Althoughdysphagia may occur at any age, it is moreprevalent in the elderly. Prevalence data suggestthat 7%-10 % of persons 50 years and older liv-ing in the community (Lindgren & Janzon,1991), up to 25% of hospitalized patients, andapproximately Losinski, Zenner, It is estimated that by 2010, 16.5 mil-lion persons will require care for dysphagia (U.S.Census Bureau, 2000). Box 12-21 Guidelines for Pressure Ulcer Treatments 1. Cleanse the wound with a noncytotoxic cleanser (saline) during each dressingchange. 2. If necrotic tissue or slough is present, con- sider the use of high-pressure irrigation. 3. Debride necrotic tissue. 4. Do not debride dry, black eschar on heels. 5. Perform wound care using topical dressings determined by wound andavailability. 6. Choose dressings that provide a moist wound environment, keep the skin sur-rounding the ulcer dry, control exu-dates, and eliminate dead space. 7. Reassess the wound with each dressing change to determine whether treat-ment plan modifications are needed. 8. Identify and manage wound infections.9. Clients with Stage III and IV ulcers that do not respond to conservative therapymay require surgical intervention.

The ability and motivation to beactive and involved in daily activities may alsobe adversely impacted. The development ofthese complications is dependent on the natureand severity of the dysphagia and overall healthstatus of the individual. The social and psychological consequences of dysphagia must also be considered in the treat-ment and evaluation of care. The effects of dys-phagia on quality of life were evaluated in 360adults with subjective dysphagia complaints liv-ing in nursing homes or clinics in four Europeancountries (Ekberg et al., 2004). The findingsconfirm the serious physiological impact of dys-phagia. Fifty-five percent reported their eatinghabits were affected by their swallowing prob-lems; over 50% ate less, with 44% experiencingweight loss; and one third were still hungry orthirsty after a meal. From a psychosocial per-spective, 45% no longer found eating to beenjoyable. More than one half indicated dys-phagia made life less enjoyable. Loss of self-esteem and an increasing sense of isolation alsowere reported. Over one third (36%) avoidedeating with others, and 41% experienced anxi-ety or panic during meals. Of the individualsinterviewed, 40% had a confirmed diagnosis,only 32% had received treatment, and just 39%believed dysphagia could be treated (Ekberg etal., 2004). An individual's ability to be nour-ished physically, emotionally, and socially isthreatened by dysphagia. Warning Signs/Risk Factors for Dysphagia Deglutition is the act of swallowing in which a food or liquid bolus is transported from themouth through the pharynx and esophagus intothe stomach. Swallowing is a complex neuro-muscular process that occurs in stages. Dys-phagia is usually identified as oropharyngeal oresophageal, designating the phase in which dys-function occurs. In the oropharyngeal phase,food is prepared for swallowing by masticationand mixing with saliva, and then is moved pos-teriorly, triggering the pharyngeal swallowreflex, which moves the bolus down the pharynx(Logeman, 1998). During the pharyngeal swal-low, the larynx closes and the epiglottis redirectsthe bolus around the airway, protecting the res-piratory tract (Logeman). The esophageal phasebegins when the bolus through loweresophageal which opens into thestomach (Logeman). Because swallowing is acomplex, coordinated event, causes of dysphagiaare multiple and diverse. Each type of dyspha-gia is characterized by specific symptoms andassociated with specific disorders. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is usually related to impairments affecting thetongue, and upper esophageal sphinc-ter (Kennedy-Malone, Fletcher, & Plank, 2004).Stroke is the leading cause of oropharyngeal dys-function (AHCPR, 1999). Persons experiencingoropharyngeal dysphagia often complain ofdifficulty initiating a swallow. A cough early inthe swallow and nasal regurgitation are symp-toms associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia(Kennedy-Malone et al., 2004). Dysphonia anddysarthria indicate motor dysfunction in thestructures involved in the oral and pharyngealphases and may be accompanied by dysphagia(Glenn-Molali, 2002). Inadequate saliva produc-tion can also interfere with the formation and28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 540 Dysphagia 541 movement of the food bolus. Candidiasis, orthrush, a fungal infection identified by whiteplaques on the mucous membranes of the oralcavity, can cause pain and discomfort swallowing. Esophageal dysphagia results from motility problems, neuromuscular problems, or obstruc-tion that interferes with the movement of thefood bolus through the esophagus into thestomach (Logeman, 1998). Common symptomsof esophageal dysphagia include complaints offood sticking after a swallow and coughing latein the swallow (Kennedy-Malone et al., 2004).Muscular spasms maycause motility problems. Inflammation of theesophagus, secondary to GERD or a retainedpill, is another etiology for esophageal dyspha-gia. Medications associated with or med-ical conditions associated with dysphagia areoutlined in Table 12-19 .Assessment Clinical evaluation of swallowing skills inpatients with conditions that predispose to dys-phagia or who voice complaints that suggest aswallowing disorder should be a priority fornursing. Evaluation, as it relates to dysphagia,can refer to screening or diagnostic testing.Screening involves determining if the patient hassigns or symptoms of dysphagia for the purposeof referring for diagnostic evaluation to identifyphysiological components of swallowing (Smith& Connolly, 2003). Nursing plays a pivotal rolein the early detection of swallowing problemsand intervening to prevent complications fromdysphagia. The findings from a screening eval-uation allow prompt referral for diagnosticworkup and implementation of interventions topromote safe eating/feeding practices. Castell (1996) suggests that 80% of dysphagia can be diagnosed through a history. The patientor caregiver should be asked about the presenceof predisposing conditions or warning signs andsymptoms. Key questions include: What type Table 12-19 Common Medical Conditions Associated with Dysphagia Classification of Dysphagia Neuromuscular Causes Mechanical CausesOropharyngeal irritationGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 541 542 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems screened acute stroke patients. The findingsdemonstrated a decrease in the number ofpatients who kept nothing by mouth (NPO), adecrease in the number of patients with inap-propriate feeding orders, and improved refer-rals (Stroke Research Unit; Davies, 2002). TheGatehead Dysphagia Management Model(GDMM), developed from the results of theCODA, provides a decision tree to guideassessment and management of dysphagia. A careful assessment of the individual eating a meal also is an essential component of an eval-uation, even if the initial screening does notsuggest a swallowing problem (CODA, Davies,2002). Observations that a prolonged time isrequired to complete a meal, \"picking\" at food,and active attempts to avoid eating (pushing thefood away, turning away from offered food,refusing to open the mouth) may indicate aswallowing problem. Environmental factorsthat influence intake and eating behaviors, suchof food causes the symptoms? Is the swallowingproblem intermittent or progressive? Is heart-burn present? The physical examination involves a cogni- tive, neuromuscular, and respiratory assessment.Important cognitive factors include interest ineating, ability to focus on and complete a meal,and the ability to remember and follow direc-tions for safe eating. Neurological assessmentinvolves testing sensory and motor componentsof the cranial nerves, in particular cranial nervesV , VII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Breath sounds, thestrength of the person's cough, and his or herability to clear the throat are clues to theintegrity of the respiratory structures and thepresence of protective mechanisms. Althoughcommonly considered to be protective, the gagreflex is not an indication of the patient's abil-ity to swallow (Logeman, 1998). However,detection of laryngeal elevation during a swal-low maneuver grossly suggests airway closure(Amella, 1996). Medications should be reviewedfor those that can decrease saliva production(antihistamines, anticholinergics, antihyperten-sives, cold medications), decrease cognition(sedatives, hypnotics), and/or decrease thestrength of the muscles involved in swallowing(antispasticity drugs). A standard procedure for bedside evaluation has not been formulated (Smith & Connolly,2003); however, screening protocols have beendeveloped and evaluated. Screening generallyinvolves a checklist for warning signs and symp-toms (Logeman, 1998). See Table 12-20 for warning signs of dysphagia. The effectiveness of trained nurses to screen for dysphagia after stroke was evaluatedin the Collaborative Dysphagia Audit Study(CODA). Nurses on a stroke unit receivedtraining in a simple water screening test andTable 12-20 Signs of Swallowing Difficulties or Dysphagia Inability to recognize foodsDifficulty placing food in the mouthInability to control food or salivaCoughing before, during, or after a swallowFrequent coughing toward the end of or immediately following a meal Recurrent pneumoniaWet, gurgly voiceWeight loss without explanation* Complaints of swallowing problems * Note: Weight gain may occur if a large quantity of high caloriebeverages such as milkshakes are consumed.Source: Information taken from Logeman 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 542 Dysphagia 543 as distractibility, fatigue, or even compatibilitywith dining companions or assistants, will notbe apparent in a bedside evaluation. Amella(1998) emphasizes the importance of contextualissues in an evaluation, pointing out thatfatigue, pain, and anxiety may mask an olderperson's true abilities. Assessment for aspiration is also important. Aspiration occurs when material passes into thelarynx below the true vocal cords; silent aspira-tion refers to situations in which aspiration doesnot produce the typical cough or change in voicequality (Smith & Connolly, 2003). Pulse oxime-try has been found to be an effective, efficienttool to detect aspiration while eating. In areview of trends in the evaluation and treatmentof dysphagia after stroke, Smith and Connolly(2003) report that a /H113502% drop in oxygen satu- ration levels from baseline detects 86% of pen-etration/aspiration. When followed by a 10 mlwater swallow test at the bedside, the ability todetect aspiration increases to 95%. Persons at risk should be assessed upon admission to a facility or community caseload;if deterioration occurs after admission, the indi-vidual should be reassessed at that time. Personswith degenerative conditions should be reas-sessed on a regular basis and when the conditionprogresses. (Monitoring lung sounds, respira-tion rate and quality, and other vital signsremains an important component of ongoingassessment and evaluation of care.) If screeningsuggests dysphagia, a referral for diagnosticevaluation should be ordered. A more focusedexamination may be conducted by a speech-language therapist (SLT). Occupational thera-pists (OT) also may be prepared to complete anextensive examination. Further testing to con-firm the diagnosis and determine the presenceof and conditions surrounding aspiration areconducted by radiology or gastroenterology sub-specialists. Special studies that may be indicatedare described in Table 12-21 . Interventions/Strategies for Care Nursing interventions to manage dysphagia inorder to minimize the risk of aspiration and pro-mote nutrition and hydration involve compensa-tory eating techniques, diet modification, andoral care, and may require adaptive equipment.Compensatory Eating TechniquesSpecific interventions are developed for personswith dysphagia based on the swallowing prob-lems identified. The results of a diagnosticworkup or referral to an SLT or OT should pro-vide specific recommendations for eating tech-niques. However, appropriate positioning iscritical for safe eating and swallowing for allindividuals. An upright position with the armsand feet supported, the head midline in a neu-tral position, and the chin slightly tucked is rec-ommended to minimize the possibility ofaspiration. The upright position should bemaintained for at least 30 to 60 minutes aftereating (the longer interval is necessary foresophageal dysphagia) (Avery-Smith, 1992).The location of food placement in the mouth aswell as the size, consistency, and temperature offood items are important sensory cues to pro-mote safe swallowing. If the individual has asensory loss or oral muscular weakness, placingfood on the unaffected or least affected side mayhelp improve control over the bolus and itsmovement to the back of the mouth. If move-ment of the food to the back of the mouth is theproblem, then placement of the bolus at theback of the tongue may be necessary to triggerthe swallow (Martin-Harris & Cherney, 1996).The bolus size also influences swallow. A small28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 543 544 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems bolus will not enter the pharynx as quickly as alarge bolus, decreasing the risk of aspiration.However, a large bolus improves movementthrough the oral cavity in persons with delayedoral transit and also prolongs laryngeal elevationand closure (Martin-Harris & Cherney, 1996).For persons with decreased oral sensation or the impaired oral movement of food, cold itemsmay improve posterior tongue movements and laryngeal swallow; for other persons a warmbolus facilitates swallowing (Glenn-Molali,2002). Careful questioning and observation of the conditions that result in optimal intakewithout evidence of swallowing problems and those associated with apparent problemswill help guide eating techniques and feedingstrategies. Characteristics of the environment, including assistive personnel and dining partners, are fac-tors that can facilitate or interfere with a safe,efficient swallow and adequate intake. For thefirst meal or eating/feeding session (and subse-quent meals in some cases) a quiet room ispreferable to decrease distractions and allowgreater concentration on eating. The health careprovider should sit down to assist with eating,positioning herself or himself and the food traydirectly across for the patient in order to main-tain the proper posture for the patient, and assurethat she or he can see and reach food items andutensils (Avery-Smith, 1992). An unhurried,calm demeanor is important. Conversationshould be limited to after a swallow is completedand before the next bite is taken. However, inter-action that requires a response from the personeating is necessary to provide information aboutchanges in voice quality as well as to promote amore pleasant social experience.

American Family Physician, 61 (2).28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 544 Dysphagia 545 Diet ModificationsModifying the texture of the food and fluidsconsumed is a common response to suspectedswallowing problems. Alterations in diet con-sistency should be tailored to the type of swal-lowing disorder. An example of levels for foodconsistency is provided in Table 12-22 . Foods can be prepared in blenders or food processors tothe approved consistency or purchased in theinfant-child food section. Attention to season-ing may improve flavor and therefore adherenceto and intake of a modified diet. Thickened fluids frequently present a chal- lenge to adequate hydration. Complaints aboutthe texture, taste, and ability to quench thirst arecommon. The Dysphagia Diet Task Force hasstandardized food and fluid textures (see Table12-22). Certain fluids have a thicker consistencynaturally, whereas others will require thickeningto the appropriate consistency with commercialor natural thickeners. Instant potato flakes,instant baby rice cereal, and mashed bananas arenatural thickeners, but may not meet special dietrequirements and may change the taste of thethickened items. Commercial thickening agentsdiffer with respect to the directions for prepara-tion and the effect of time on consistency. Thetype and temperature of the fluid to be thickenedalso affect mixing directions, so it is importantto be familiar with the product used by the facil-ity or individual at home. Encouraging fluid intake with thickened liq- uids often requires creativity and persistence.Some facilities allow dysphagia patients to drinkplain water between meals while requiring thick-ened liquids with meals. There are contradictorybeliefs about the likelihood that allowing plainwater will lead to aspiration pneumonia (Garon, Table 12-22 The National Dysphagia Diet (NDD) The National Dysphagia Diet (NDD) provides guidelines for progressive diets to be used nationally inthe treatment of dysphagia. pieces; avoid scrambled eggs, cereals with lumps. Dysphagia Mechanically Altered (NDD 2): Moist, soft-foods; easily formed into a bolus; ground meats; soft, tender vegetables; soft fruit; slightly moistened dry cereal with little texture.

Oralcare appears to be a crucial link in the aspirationto pneumonia process (Langmore et al., 1998).Frequent oral care to ensure the oral cavity is clearof food particles and prevent the growth of bac-teria is a critical component of liberalized fluidprograms, and an essential strategy to minimizethe risk for pneumonia. Oral HygieneExamination of the relative risk of multiple fac-tors (medical/health status, functional status,dysphagia/gastroesophageal reflux, feeding/mode of nutritional intake, and oral/dental sta-tus) in the development of pneumonia in olderpersons suggests that colonization and hostresistance are key contributors (Langmore et al.,1998). Oropharyngeal colonization from inad-equate oral care, decayed teeth, or periodontaldisease is the initial process that can lead to thedevelopment of pneumonia. Aspiration of theseorganisms in liquids, food, or saliva combinedwith decreased immunity increases the risk fordevelopment of pneumonia. Regular cleaning of the teeth or dentures, gums, and tongue and maintaining moisture inthe mouth are essential components of an oralhygiene protocol (see Johnson and Chalmers[2002]) for tools and strategies to address vari-ous problems providing oral care). A soft tooth-brush, gauze-covered swabs, or foam toothettesmay be used to scrub the surfaces of the oral cav-ity after meals. Electric toothbrushes may alsobe useful tools and, depending on the person'sphysical and cognitive abilities, may enable theolder person with limited hand grasp and move-ment to more adequately and independentlyclean the mouth's surfaces. Individuals whoreceive non-oral feedings also need to have reg-ular oral care to remove debris. The teeth andmouth should be cleaned upon awakening, aftermeals (or snacks for persons with dysphagia),and before bed. Dentures should be taken outand scrubbed at least daily with a brush; chem-ical denture cleaner tablets may be used in addi- tionto brushing with soap or toothpaste (Johnson & Chalmers, 2002). Soaking dentures in a solu-tion of white wine vinegar and cold water (a50:50 solution) will help remove built-up cal-culus. Denture cups must also be cleaned orreplaced regularly. A weekly cleaning and soak-ing of the denture cup in a diluted hypochloritesolution for an hour followed by thorough wash-ing with soap and water will help sterilize thecontainer (Johnson & Chalmers, 2002) if fre-quent replacement is not feasible. Maintaining moist mucous membranes is essential to the health and integrity of the oralcavity. Dry membranes contribute to anincreased rate of plaque accumulation (Almstahl& Wikstrom, 1999), and dental and dentureplaque serve as a major reservoir for pathogenicorganisms in the elderly (Aizen et al., 2004).Many of the medications prescribed for chronicconditions result in a dry mouth. Limited fluidintake and infrequent oral care, especially forpersons who are ordered nothing by mouth,contribute to dryness. Meticulous oral care asoutlined previously is crucial; however, addi-tional measures may be needed. Saliva substi-tutes, toothpaste and mouth rinses withoutalcohol or excessive additives such as in theBiotene range, water or mouthwash in spraybottles to spritz inside the mouth, applyingwater-soluble lubricants to the tongue andcheeks, and Vaseline or lanolin applied fre-quently to the lips are among the strategies rec-ommended for combating dry mouth in thephysically dependent or cognitively impairedolder adult (Johnson & Chalmers, 2002). 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 546 Dysphagia 547 Box 12-23 Providing adequate fluid before and after administering medications will helpmaintain moisture and decrease the likeli-hood of impaired transport and esophagealirritation. Box 12-24 Monitor abdominal distention by mea- suring the abdominal circumference fromiliac crest to ileac crest. An increase inmeasurement of 8-10 cm beyond baselineis considered distention.Non-oral FeedingsThe initiation of tube feedings is a complicateddecision made by the patient, health careprovider, and family or health care surrogate.Often prescribed to maintain adequate nutritionand hydration levels and prevent aspiration, per-sons receiving non-oral feedings are still at riskfor aspiration (Logeman, 1998) and inadequatenutritional intake. Attention to positioningduring and after a feeding and meticulous oralhygiene are very important in preventing orminimizing the risk for aspiration in personsreceiving enteral nutrition. In a literature reviewon GI motility, feeding tube site, and aspiration,Metheny, Schallom, and Edward (2004) reportedthat the \"aspiration risk exists to some extent inall tube-fed patients, depending on GI dys-motility patterns and individual patient charac-teristics. However, regardless of the feeding site,it is ultimately regurgitated gastric contentsthat are aspirated into the lungs. For this reason,the assessment of greatest interest for tube-fedpatients is the evaluation of gastric emptying\"(p. 131). Although the need for additionalresearch is indicated, Edwards and Metheny(2000) suggest McClave et al.'s (1999) recom-mendation that a residual volume (RV) greaterthan or equal to 200 cc for nasogastric tubes andgreater than or equal to 100 cc for gastrostomytubes should raise concern about intolerance. Adaptive equipmentThe modification of utensils or use of adaptiveequipment is frequently necessary to promoteindependence in eating and to facilitate safeswallowing. However, careful evaluation of eat-ing is needed for each person to ensure safe andeffective tools are used. Using a straw to drinkmoves a fluid bolus quickly through the mouthand can exacerbate problems with swallowing.Drinking from a cup requires the head to betilted to empty the glass; this maneuver(hyperextension) can increase the risk of aspi-ration. Specially designed cups with a cutoutfor the nose can be purchased or made to pre-vent the need to tilt the head back. Similarly,shallow bowls on spoons may be helpful in pre-venting hypertension when eating with aspoon (Glenn-Molali, 2002). An ongoingassessment of abilities and problems at mealtime will help assure necessary changes to theplan of care are made in a timely manner.Rehabilitation nurses, and texts and continuingeducation programs focusing on swallowingevaluation and feeding techniques are resourcesfor new tools and techniques. Physical, occu-pational, and speech-language therapists canrecommend specific techniques and equipmentfor safe intake and can help modify availabletools. Their expertise and assistance should besought.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 547 548 Chapter 12: Management of Common Problems Although these volumes were associated withdysmotility, McClave et al. emphasize theimportance of giving consideration to othersymptoms of intolerance before holding feed-ings. Interruptions and incomplete feedingsinterfere with the nutritional adequacy of non-oral diets. Nausea/vomiting, absent bowelsounds, abdominal distention, and stool patternare clues to intolerance that should be evaluatedand factored into the decision. Managing GERDThe relationship between gastroesophagealreflux (GERD) and enteral nutrition remainsunclear; however, interventions to prevent thedevelopment of reflux or esophageal irritationand treat GERD are supported by data impli-cating reflux in the development of aspiration.An individual's diet pattern, in particular foodor fluids associated with heartburn or discom-fort, should be evaluated. Coffee, spicy foods,fatty foods, citrus fruits, alcohol, and smokingmay weaken the lower esophageal sphincter andcontribute to the development of the symptomsof reflux (Kennedy-Malone et al., 2004). Dietmodification can be a simple, effective strategy.Sitting up for at least an hour after eating and/orraising the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches withblocks may help control the onset of symptoms,too. An oral protein pump inhibitor taken 60minutes before a meal may be indicated(Kennedy-Malone et al., 2004). Be sure an ade-quate amount of fluid is consumed before andafter oral medications are administered to avoidesophageal irritation. Conclusion The prevention and early recognition and man-agement of common health problems in theelderly require knowledge of the person and hisor her lifestyle, an understanding of risk factorsand warning signs of health problems, an aware-ness of options for treatment, and the ability to work with the older person and/or caregiver to establish goals and implement a plan of care.Intellectual, technical, and interpersonal skillsmust be interwoven to support and maintainhealth. \"Nurses weave a tapestry of care, knowl-edge, relationship, and trust that is critical to apatient's survival\" (Gordon, 1997, p. 12). Thistapestry is also essential to maintaining the dig-nity, unique identity, and quality of life in theelderly by preventing the development of con-ditions that limit function and fulfillment.28438_CH12_475_560.qxd 6/7/06 4:33 PM Page 548 Conclusion 549 Box 12-25 Research Highlight Aim: This study evaluated the relationship between urge urinary incontinence and the risk of falls and fractures in older women. Methods: Community-dwelling women aged 65 years and older, participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), were recruited. Of 7,847 subjects in the SOF, 6,049 metcriteria and completed data collection. Participants completed a self-administered ques-tionnaire on demographic data, personal habits, medical conditions, and medications.Cognitive and functional examinations were conducted. The women were asked to callthe study staff as soon as possible if a fracture occurred. Every 4 months participants weresent a postcard to return reporting any falls or fractures. Radiographic verifications offractures were obtained. Findings: The sample was composed of white women with an average age of 78.5 years; the majority (80%) was considered in good health and only 5% had poor cognitive function.Fifty-five percent reported at least one fall over a mean follow-up period of 3.0 years(range 90 days to 4.2 years). About 20% reported one fall per year with 5% reporting anaverage of one fall a year; 8.5% experienced a fracture. Almost half (46.6%) reported atleast one episode of UI per month over the past year. One quarter of the participants (n/H110051,493) had urge incontinence at least weekly, and 18.8% ( n/H110051,137) reported at least weekly stress incontinence. Seven hundred and eight women (11.7%) had bothstress and urge incontinence. Weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was independ-ently associated with falling (odds ratio [OR] 1.26; P/H11021.001), whereas weekly or more frequent stress incontinence was not associated with falls (OR 1.06, P/H11005.3). Weekly or more frequent urge incontinence was also independently associated with the risk of frac-tures (relative hazard [RH] 1.34; P/H11005.02). Weekly or more frequent urge urinary incon- tinence independently increased the risk of falls 26% and the risk of fractures 34%. Conclusion: Identification and treatment of urge urinary incontinence may be an effective intervention to decrease falls and fractures in community-dwelling women. Source: Brown, J. S., et al.

Mrs. Jones, an 80-year-old widow living alone in the community, was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Concurrent health problems include osteoarthritis and osteo-porosis. During the initial home health visit, the nurse notices the faint odor of urine. Uponquestioning, Mrs. Jones reports she often is up several times a night to urinate. She says shehas done this for years and has adjusted. Should this be considered a problem? What addi-tional information is needed for decision making? What evidence can the nurse provideto Mrs. Jones to support a need for further evaluation and treatment of this problem? 2. Your grandfather has been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. He lives indepen- dently and is cognitively alert. When you go to the hospital to stay with him, you find himconfused and disoriented. He is in bilateral arm restraints. Upon questioning the nursingstaff about the restraints, they report that he has been trying to pull his IV out and gets outof bed without calling for assistance. His nurse states that they do not have time to staywith him. What interventions would you discuss implementing with his nursing staff? 3.

The nursing staff in a long-term care facility insist that checking residents every 3 hours for incontinence and changing undergarments when needed is more cost-effective andlabor-saving than bladder training. They point out that no one has developed skinbreakdown. Develop a plan to promote continence and a rationale to support imple-mentation. Consider your philosophy of nursing and conception of care for elderly inthe rationale. 2. You have been involved in a motor vehicle accident and wake up in the ICU with both arms restrained. Discuss the emotions you would experience. What would you want thenursing staff to say or do? 3. Wear a protective undergarment for 24 hours and follow a 2-hour toileting schedule dur- ing the day. How do the experiences influence your activity and your mood? 4. Have someone feed you an entire meal. What was your interaction like (who talked, what were the topics of conversation)?

KEY TERMS Assistive device Assistive technology Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) Emergency response system (ERS) 563 Environmental controls Internet Nursing informatics World Wide Web28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 563 564 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology This century reflects a time of change for nurs-ing and the way that nurses deliver health careto the population over the age of 65 years.Americans are living longer, and by the year2030 this age cohort will increase from about 30million in the 1990s to more than 70 million(U.S. Census Bureau, 2004). Most of these indi-viduals expect to have an active life in the com-munity well into their seventh decade. Eachdecade of life past age 65 brings with it acuteillnesses and chronic conditions accompanied byincreased disability (CDC, 2004). Nurses caringfor older adults must advocate for and use newways to provide care to these adults that pro-motes their quality of life. The purpose of thischapter is to provide information about the inte-gration of nursing care with the latest assistive technology that supports the care of older adults, as well as describe the technologies onthe horizon. Introduction to Assistive Technology This growing population of older adults willchange many aspects of health care. One changewill be an increase in the number of people whoexperience a disabling condition. As individu-als age or become disabled, mental and physicalchanges may influence their ability to live asindependently and productively as they wouldwish. A lessening or loss of strength, balance,visual and auditory acuity, cognitive processing,and/or memory may affect the way they are ableto function at home. Assistive technology devices are mechanical aids that substitute for or enhance the functionof some physical or mental ability that isimpaired (Kelker, 1997). The term assistive tech-nology encompasses a broad range of devices from \"low tech\" (e.g., pencil grips, splints, paper sta-bilizers) to \"high tech\" (e.g., computers, voicesynthesizers, Braille readers). These devicesinclude the entire range of supportive tools andequipment, from adapted spoons to wheelchairsand computer systems for environment control. As a tool for living, the primary purpose of assistive technology is to bridge the gapbetween an older person's declining capabilitiesand the unchanging environmental demands ofhome and community (Gitlin, 1998). The useof assistive devices may enable independent per-formance, increase safety, reduce risk of injury,improve balance and mobility, improve com-munication, and limit complications of an ill-ness or disability. These devices are not just forthose who are disabled or have functional limi-tations. Assistive devices can also help individ-uals who are aging and who may benefit fromusing them to promote safety and reduce therisk of injury, as well as individuals experienc-ing age-related changes or functional declineand who may benefit from equipment anddevices that enable independent performanceand prevent disability. Norburn and colleagues (1995) found that a large number of older adults practice someform of self-care, even in the absence of reporteddisability. Their study determined the \"extentto which self-care coping strategies, defined asmodifying the environment, changing behav-ior, and/or using special equipment and devices,are employed by older adults at all levels offunctioning in order to maintain a viable andindependent social life without the need forinstitutional care\" (p. S101). More than 75% ofthe subjects made behavioral changes in theirdaily routines (e.g., doing things more slowly)during the year before the survey. About 42%28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 564 Introduction to Assistive Technology 565 of the subjects reported using assistive devices,and almost one third had modified their builtenvironment. Assistive Device Use Living at home can be made easier with the useof assistive devices . The increased indepen- dence afforded individuals who use these devicesmay ultimately result in their being able toremain in their homes for longer periods of timewith reduced concerns for safety. Many of thesedevices are inexpensive and easy to obtain, butthe general population's knowledge of them ispoor. Consequently, individuals who are agingor disabled may not be living their lives to theirfullest potential. There is no evidence to suggest that older adults use assistive technology and devices lessthan young adults, but it is not known whetherthere is greater reluctance among the elderly touse high-technology vs. low-technology solu-tions. A number of research and service pro-grams are currently evaluating the willingnessof older adults to use high technology, such ascomputer-based systems to increase communi-cation, and social integration and smart housearrangements to increase safety and function(Gitlin & Schemm, 1996). The probability of engaging in self-care prac- tices and the type of strategy employed varieswith levels of impairment. Older adults withmoderate levels of impairment rely more on spe-cial equipment and assistive devices, whereasthose with slight functional impairments tendto change their behavior (Norburn et al., 1995).\"Of importance is the consistent finding thatdevice use has a dual outcome: At the same timethat a device promotes independence, it appearsto also raise concerns about social stigma, feel-ings of embarrassment, and issues related to per-sonal identity and self-definition\" (Gitlin, 1998,p. 154). There is no stigma involved in the useof developmentally appropriate equipment ortools for children (e.g., jumbo crayons), so whyshould equipment and device use in older adultsbe seen as a response to disability (e.g., wide Dr. Grip pens)? Mann, Hurren, and Tomita (1993) studied assistive device use by interviewing 157 nonin-stitutionalized older persons in their homes.Study participants were not selected randomly,however, but were individuals who were recentlyor currently receiving services from a human ser-vice agency, hospital, or nursing home. Theresearchers used the definition of an assistivedevice provided in the Technology-RelatedAssistance for Individuals with Disabilities Actof 1988: \"Any item, piece of equipment, or pro-duct system, whether acquired commercially offthe shelf, modified, or customized that is usedto increase, maintain, or improve functionalcapabilities of individuals with disabilities\"(U.S. Congress, 1988). They found that subjectsowned a mean of 13.7 devices and used 10.8 ofthe devices. Older persons with multiple im-pairments that included physical impairmentsused the greatest number of devices. Subjectsalso expressed a need for additional equipmentand devices. Another study by Mann, Hurren, and Tomita (1995) examined the need for and current use ofassistive devices by home-based older adultswith arthritis. Subjects were assigned to a mod-erate or a severe arthritis group according to theimpact of arthritis on their activities. Subjectsin the severe arthritis group had more chronicdiseases, a higher level of pain, and a lower levelof independence in self-care activities than sub-jects in the moderate group. Both groupsreported using a high number of assistive28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 565 566 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology devices (about 10 per person), and expressed theneed for additional devices, such as reachers,magnifiers, jar openers, grab bars, and hearingaids. Generally, there was a high rate of satis-faction with the equipment and devices used. More recently, Kraskowsky and Finlayson (2001) reported usage rates from 47% to 82%of equipment and devices prescribed. Mann,Goodall, Justiss, and Tomita (2002) found thatstudy participants owned a mean of 14.2 assis-tive devices, used 84.8% of the devices, andwere satisfied with 84.2% of the devices theyowned. Mann, Llanes, Justiss, and Tomita(2004) looked at the value older individualsthemselves place on their equipment anddevices by interviewing 1,016 home-based frailolder adults in western New York and northernFlorida, specifically asking them what they con-sidered their \"most important\" assistive deviceand why. Although \"importance\" is a generalconstruct, it embodies the perception of \"use-fulness\" and impact on ability to do tasks andparticipate in activities. Not considering thenumber of users, the top five most importantequipment and devices were eyeglasses, canes,wheelchairs, walkers, and telephones. Controll-ing for the number of people using the device,the top five most important devices were oxy-gen tanks, (1999) studied the effectiveness ofassistive devices and environmental modifica-tions in maintaining independence and reduc-ing home care costs. One hundred four frailolder adults recently referred to home healthcare were randomly assigned to a treatmentgroup or a control group. Individuals in thetreatment group received a functional assess-ment, a home assessment, and any necessaryequipment and/or assistive devices and environ-mental interventions. The control group receivedusual care services. The frail older adults in thestudy experienced functional decline over time,but the control group declined significantlymore. Costs related to hospitalization and nurs-ing home stays were more than three timeshigher for the control group. This randomizedcontrol trial provided strong evidence thatappropriate and necessary equipment or devicescan slow the rate of functional decline andreduce health-related costs. Based on the literature, a number of conclu- sions can be drawn. Although studies haveshown varied results, a consistent finding is thatolder adults are willing to use assistive devices.Studies have also concluded that some individ-uals, particularly those who are less impaired,might be more likely to modify their behaviorsthan use equipment or devices for assistance.Unfortunately, the definition of assistive devicesvaries across studies as well as the characteristicsof the individuals studied. For example, Mannand colleagues tend to seek older adult subjectswho are impaired or at risk for needing assistivedevices. Regardless of the study, however, re-searchers have stated that older adults are lackingadequate information about assistive technologythat could improve quality of life. Teaching About the Use ofAssistive Technology Use of assistive technology is a type of healthbehavior among older adults to maintain theirindependence and enable them to live at home.From the viewpoints of national health economyand quality of life of older adults and caregivers,it is important to understand who does not usedevices and why they do not. This type of tech-28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 566 Introduction to Assistive Technology 567 nology offers the potential of increasing inde-pendence and quality of life for older individu-als, as well as reducing health-related costs. A study by Mann, Goodall, Justiss, and Tomita (2002) sought to identify those types of equip-ment and devices with a higher frequency ofnonuse, and the reasons given by older adults fornot using them. Based on the RehabilitationEngineering Research Center on Aging Con-sumer Assessments Study, 1,056 subjects re-ported use or nonuse of assistive devices. Of thesesubjects, 873 identified reasons for not using orbeing dissatisfied with certain equipment anddevices. These were grouped into categoriesbased on the type of impairment they addressed(hearing, vision, cognition, and musculoskeletal/neuromotor). Study participants owned the larg-est number of equipment and devices in themusculoskeletal/neuromotor category, such ascanes. Equipment and devices in the hearingimpairment category were rated lowest by par-ticipants in terms of satisfaction. Almost half ofall reasons listed for not using certain assistivedevices related to perceived lack of need. The purpose of a study by Tomita, Mann, Frass, and Stanton (2004) was to identify pre-dictors of the use of assistive devices that addressphysical impairments among cognitively intact,physically frail older adults living at home.Interviewers who visited their homes identifiedequipment and devices in use. White elders wholive alone in the south, are physically disabled,take more medications, and are less depressedtend to use more equipment and devices toaddress physical impairments than nonwhiteelders who are living with someone in the north-ern United States and who have less severity ofphysical disability, take fewer medications, andare more depressed. Among all the variables,physical disability was the most significant pre-dictor of use. Consistent with findings from pre-vious studies, income, education, and maritalstatus were not associated with their use. In addi-tion, age and gender were not significant. Kraskowsky and Finlayson (2001) compared 14 studies of factors influencing use of assistivedevices by older adults. They found that use ofthem decreased over time. The primary reasonfor nonuse was lack of fit between the personand the person's environment. They suggested arange of factors to consider when prescribingassistive technology to older adults, includingpersonal (client) factors, the equipment anddevice's fit with the client's environment, andintervention-related factors. Creating a positiveexpectation for the use of the equipment and/ordevice, when it is introduced, can influence theclient factor. Knowing what to expect in theclient's environment when prescribing an assis-tive device can influence its fit within the envi-ronment. Increasing the frequency and durationof education on the assistive device can posi-tively influence use. A careful evaluation of older adults is an important step in determining their need forassistive devices and equipment to enhance andmaintain independence and quality of life(Kraskowsky & Finlayson, 2001). The evalua-tion may occur during acute care, inpatientrehabilitation, home care, or outpatient visits(Roelands, Van Oost, Depoorter, & 2002)by therapist, dietitian, or socialworker). Typically, an occupational therapistdetermines whether the equipment is appro-priate for older adults and their environmentand educates them and their caregivers on useand care of assistive devices. However, all teammembers have a responsibility for evaluationand follow-up, as needed. Appropriate fit28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 568 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology between the person's ability, the demands of theenvironment, and each piece of equipment ordevice is essential to successful task performance. Assistive devices and equipment are typically first introduced in the hospital, outpatient, orhome care setting, primarily to enhance inde-pendence in self-care. During inpatient rehabil-itation, an older adult will receive an average ofeight pieces of equipment and/or devices to usein the home for mobility, dressing, seating,bathing, grooming, and feeding. Those livingin the community with a functional impairmentreport having an average of 14 pieces of equip-ment and/or devices in the home, includingthose for hearing and vision (Gitlin & Schemm,1996). With shortened hospital stays and brieferexposure to occupational and physical therapy,the need for efficient and effective instruction inassistive device use becomes that much moreimportant for nurses. Teaching an elderly per-son to use technology should not be limited tothe person alone, but should include caregiversand other family members. Education must besensitive to any physical, cognitive, psycholog-ical, and environmental factors that affect theelderly person. When introducing technology tothe elderly and teaching them to use it, there areseveral guidelines that can be employed ( see Box 13-1 ). Common Applications of Assistive Technology The following are common assistive technologyapplications (Kelker, 1997): 1) position andmobility, 2) environmental access and control,3) self-care, 4) sensory impairment, 5) socialinteraction and recreation, and 6) computer-based technology.Box 13-1 Guidelines for Introducing Technology, and Teaching the Elderly About Its Use The use of technology must be perceived as needed and meaningful,and must be linked to the lifestyle ofthe person. Cautions and disbelief in one's capa- bility may be an obstacle in acceptingnew technology and must be consid-ered when creating the learningenvironment. A generous amount of time as well as repeated short training sessions shouldbe allowed. More stress should be placed on the practical application of the device thanon its technical features. Only selective, central facts should be presented. Mnemonics and cues will favorably affect self-efficacy in handling newproducts. Training sessions should be held in the home or natural meeting places of theelderly. The instructor should be well-known by the elderly or introduced well inadvance of the training. The attitudes of the instructors toward the aged must be positive andrealistic. Source: Idaho Assistive Technology Project. (1995). Assistive technology and older adults. Information Sheet #25.28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 568 Common Applications of Assistive Technology 569 Position and Mobility Older adults may need assistance with theirpositions for seating so that they can effectivelyparticipate in activities and interact with others.Generally, nurses or therapists try to achieve anupright, forward-facing position for the indi-vidual by using padding, structured chairs,straps, supports, or restraints to hold the bodyin a stable and comfortable manner (Kelker,1997). Examples of equipment used for posi-tioning are walkers, floor sitters, chair inserts,wheelchairs, straps, traps, and standing aids. Conversely, older adults whose physical impair- ments limit their mobility may need a device tohelp them get around or participate in activities.Mobility devices include self-propelled walkers,manual or powered wheelchairs, and poweredrecreational vehicles like bikes and scooters. Environmental Access andControl Access to shopping centers, places of business,schools, recreation, and transportation is possi-ble because of assistive technology modifica-tions. This kind of assistive technology includesmodifications to buildings, rooms, or otherfacilities that allow people with physical impair-ments to use ramps and door openers to enter,allow people with visual disabilities to followBraille directions and move more freely withina facility, and allow people of short stature orpeople who use wheelchairs to reach pay phonesor operate elevators (Kelker, 1997). Once inside a building, various types of envi- ronmental controls , including remote control switches and special adaptations of on/offswitches to make them accessible (e.g., Velcroattachments, pointer sticks), can promote inde-pendent use of equipment by an older adult.Robotic arms and other environmental controlsystems turn lights on and off, open doors, andoperate appliances. X-10 is an electronic envi-ronmental control that allows individuals tocontrol lights, heating, and cooling, as well asjust about any electrical piece of equipment,such as curtains, garage doors, and gates. Basicinstallation is very easy for lamps and plug-initems. The minimum requirements are one con-trol unit and one control module. No wiring isrequired. First, the control unit is plugged in,then the lamp to be controlled is plugged intoa module, and finally the module is pluggedinto an outlet. There are also several types ofmodules and switches available to replace exist-ing wall switches (X-10, 2005). Self-Care Assistive devices for such itemsas robotics, electric feeders, adapted utensils, spe-cially designed toilet seats, and aids for toothbrushing, washing, dressing, and grooming. Anemergency response system (ERS) can increase the safety of an individual who requires assistancewith self-care activities. The most common ERSis the telephone-based personal emergency re-sponse system (PERS), which consists of the sub-scriber wearing a small help button as a necklaceor wristband, with a home communicator that isconnected to a residential phone line (Mihailidis& Lee, 2003). In the event of an emergency, thesubscriber presses the help button and is con-nected to a live emergency response center, whicharranges for appropriate help, such as callingparamedics or the person's family. Remote health monitoring devices have also been developed that measure and track variousphysiological parameters, such as pulse, skintemperature, and blood pressure (Mihailidis &Lee, 2003). These systems are less commonly28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 569 570 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology found in the home, but are growing in demanddespite their restrictions. They require the userto wear the device at all times, and/or to manu-ally take the required measurements and enterthe data into the system, which then automati-cally transmits to an evaluation and emergencyservice station. Many of the PERS and physiological-based monitoring systems are inappropriate, obtru-sive, and difficult for an older adult to operate.These systems require effort from the person,sometimes long training times in order for theperson to learn how to use the required features,and they become ineffective during more seri-ous emergency situations, such as if the personhas a stroke (Mihailidis & Lee, 2003). As aresult, new systems are being developed that donot require manual interaction from the userand that use nonphysiological measures to de-termine health parameters. Studies have shownthat a decline in an older adult's ability to com-plete activities of daily living (ADLs) is a strongindicator of declining health and may increasethe likelihood of an emergency situation occur-ring (Mihailidis & Lee). Several researchers aredeveloping systems that can monitor ADLs inthe home. These systems use simple switches,sensors, and transducers located at various placesin the user's environment and attached to var-ious objects to detect which tasks are beingcompleted. Sensory Impairment Older adults may experience impairment intheir speech, hearing, or sight. From 2 to 2.5million Americans have communication disor-ders too severe to permit them to meet theirdaily communication needs using only naturalspeech and handwriting (National Institutes ofHealth [NIH], 2000). The term augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) refersto all forms of communication that enhance orsupplement speech and writing, either tem-porarily or permanently. Augmentative andalternative communication can both enhance(augmentative) and replace (alternative) con-ventional forms of expression for people whocannot communicate through speech, writing,or gestures. Augmentative and alternative com-munication devices offer dynamic displays (i.e.,electronic displays that change with user input),synthesized (computer-generated) and digital-ized (recorded) speech, and are accessible including touchscreen,keyboard, and infrared headpointers (Dickerson,Stone, Panchura, & Usiak, 2002). The goal of AAC is to encourage and support the development of communicative competenceso that people can participate as fully as possi-ble in home and community environments, andto improve the efficiency and use of communi-cation aids. Selecting the communication meth-ods that are best for an individual is not assimple as getting a prescription for eyeglasses(American Speech-Language-Hearing Associa-tion [ASLHA], 1997). Language is complex,and individuals learn to use it every day. Indeed,developing the best communication system fora person with a severe speech and languageproblem requires evaluation by many specialists(ASLHA), all of whom may not have offices inthe same building or even in the same city.Communication boards, using pictures as sym-bols for words, may need to be made. Vocabularyto meet the needs of a wide range of communi-cation disorder situations must be selected.Equipment may need to be ordered and paid for.Health plans or other third-party payors mayneed to be contacted. And once all the parts of the communication plan are in place, the user must learn to operateeach part of the system effectively and effi-28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 570 Common Applications of Assistive Technology 571 ciently. Professionals (e.g., nurses, therapists)need to help the user and his or her communi-cation partners learn a variety of skills andstrategies, which might include the meaning ofcertain hand shapes and how to make them;starting and stopping a piece of electronicequipment at a desired word or picture; ways toget a person's attention; ways to help a commu-nication partner understand a message; andincreasing the rate of communication (ASLHA,1997). Without effort by the user, professionalhelp, ongoing practice, and support from friends,family, and colleagues, the promises of augmen-tative communication may not be realized. Much of the time, individuals are expected to learn through listening. Hearing impairmentscan interfere with an older adult's speaking, read-ing, and ability to follow directions. Assistivedevices to help with hearing and auditory pro-cessing problems include hearing aids, personalFM units, Phonic Ear, or closed caption TV . Vision is also a major learning mode. General methods for assisting with vision problemsinclude increasing contrast, enlarging stimuli,and making use of tactile and auditory models.Devices that assist with vision include screenreaders, screen enlargers, magnifiers, large-typebooks, taped books, Braillers, light boxes, highcontrast materials, and scanners. Social Interaction andRecreation Older adults still want to have fun and inter-act socially with others. Assistive technologycan help them to participate in all sorts ofrecreational activities that can be interactivewith friends (Kelker, 1997). Some adaptedrecreational activities include drawing soft-ware, computer games, computer simulations,painting with a head or mouth wand, andadapted puzzles.Computer-Based AssistiveTechnology Some older adults may require special devicesthat provide access to computers. Controllableanatomical movements like eye blinks, head orneck movements, or mouth movements may beused to operate equipment that provides accessto the computer. Once a controllable anatomi-cal site has been determined, decisions can bemade about input devices including switches,alternative keyboards, mouse, trackball, touchwindow, speech recognition, and head pointers(Kelker, 1997). Computers are an important type of assistive technology because they open up so many excit-Box 13-2 Resource List Adaptive and Assistive Technology, www.rehabtool.com Administration on Aging, www.aoa.govAssociation of Retired Persons, www.aarp.org BrainBashers Games and Puzzles, http://brainbashers.com the official www.medicare.govNational Association of Area Agencies on Aging, www.n4a.org National Library of Medicine, www.nlm.nih.gov SeniorNet, www.seniornet.org28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 571 572 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology ing possibilities for writing, speaking, findinginformation, or controlling an individual's envi-ronment. Software can provide the tools forwritten expression, calculation, reading, basicreasoning, and higher level thinking skills. Thecomputer can also be used to access a wide vari-ety of databases. Many examples of the assistive devices men- tioned above can be found on the ABLEDATAWeb site (www.abledata.com). It is a federallyfunded project whose primary mission is to pro-vide information on assistive technology, includ-ing all types of adaptive equipment and assistivedevices, available from domestic and internationalsources to consumers, organizations, professionals,and caregivers within the United States. TheABLEDATA database contains information onmore than 30,000 assistive technology products(over 20,000 of which are currently available),from white canes to voice output programs. Thedatabase contains detailed descriptions of eachproduct including price and company informa-tion. The database also contains information onnoncommercial prototypes, customized and one-of-a-kind products, and do-it-yourself designs. The Internet and the World Wide Web The Internet is not just about data; it is an international community of people who shareinformation, interact, and communicate. Fromthe point of view of its users, the Internet as anassistive technology is a vast collection ofresources that includes people, information, andmultimedia. The Internet is best characterizedas the biggest labyrinth of computer networkson earth ( Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing [FOLDOC ], 2004). A computer network is adata communications system made up of hard-ware and software that transmits data from onecomputer to another. In part, a computer networkincludes a physical infrastructure of hardwarelike wires, cables, fiber optic lines, underseacables, and satellites. The other part of a net-work is the software to keep it running. Com-puter networks can connect to other computernetworks to get an even bigger computer net- Box 13-3 Recommended Readings American Nurses Association. (2001).

Thus, the Internet is a set of connectedcomputer networks. In contrast, the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is not a network. The Web is not the Internet itself, nor is it a pro-prietary system like America Online. Instead,the Web is a system of clients (Web browsers)and servers that use the Internet to exchange data(FOLDOC ). The Internet and the World Wide Web are evolving into an environment for collaboration,content exchange, mentorship, and creative en-deavors. This virtual environment is becomingan accessible place for the building of intellec-tual assets, where knowledge can be effectivelyidentified, distributed, and shared. Nursingprofessionals are joining this growing evolutionin a number of different ways. Many nurseswork hard to shape at least some of the Internetand World Wide Web into a milieu for activeparticipation that serves to inform, educate, andadvocate for older adults. Some nurses may spe-cialize in nursing informatics . Nursing Informatics Nursing informatics is a 21st-century sciencewith great potential for improving the quality,safety, and efficiency of health care. About 20years ago, Hannah proposed a simple definitionfor nursing informatics. She said that nursinginformatics encompasses the use of informationtechnologies in relation to any functions that arewithin the sphere of nursing and that are carriedout by nurses in the performance of their prac-tice (Ball & Hannah, 1988). Graves and Corcoran (1989) presented a more complex definition of nursing informatics. Theyargued that \"nursing informatics is a combina-tion of computer science, information science andnursing science, designed to assist in the man-agement and processing of nursing data, infor-mation and knowledge to support the practice ofnursing and the delivery of nursing care\" (p. 227).The American Nurses Association (ANA) modi-fied the Graves and Corcoran definition when itdeveloped the Scope and Practice for Nursing In- formatics and distinguished between practice and theory (ANA, 1994). The ANA currently definesnursing informatics as \"a specialty that integratesnursing science, computer science, and informa-tion science to manage and communicate data,information, and knowledge in nursing practice. . . to support patients, nurses, and other pro-viders in their decision-making . . . using infor-mation structures, information processes andinformation technology\" (2001, p. 46). The Scope and Standards of Nursing Informatics Practice is a professional guideline and an essen- tial reference for nurses (ANA, 2001). A con-densed outline of nursing informatics concepts,terms, roles, and competencies written by acommittee of recognized leaders in the field ispresented in this booklet. These competenciescover four distinct skill levels that include thebeginning nurse, experienced nurse, informat-ics nurse, and informatics innovator (Staggers,Gassert, & Curran, 2001). The ANA compe-tencies include computer literacy (basic com-puter skills), information literacy (libraryscience or retrieving and evaluating informa-tion), and overall informatics competencies.Although nursing informatics is a growing areaof specialization, all nurses can employ basicinformation technology in their practice. Using the Web The fastest growing segment of an estimatedmore than 80 million navigators of the Web inthe United States is older adults (U.S. Depart-ment of Commerce, 2002). Estimates of those28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 573 574 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology adults over 50 years of age on the Internet rangefrom 16% of users to 45% (Center for MedicareEducation, 2002). In the year 2000, about 60%of older adult Web users were men and about40% were women. In February 2004, the gen-der ratio among these users had shifted to 50%men and 50% women (Pew Internet & Amer-ican Life Project, 2004). Computer ownershiphas increased among older adults; 40% of theseadults currently report having a personal com-puter at home compared to 29% in 1995. Ad-ditionally, 1 in 10 older adults without access tothe Internet from home or from work say thatthey sometimes access the Internet from anotherplace such as a friend's, neighbor's, or relative'shome or the public library (Center for MedicareEducation). These older adults spend more than8 hours online each week, using Web-basedmaterials or electronic documents in various for-mats and media. Researchers have found that Web use by older adults enhances self-esteem and increases a senseof productivity and accomplishment (Purnell &Sullivan-Schroyer, 1997) as well as increasingtheir social interaction (Kautzmann, 1990; Post,1996). Web use adults' needs control (McConatha, McConatha, &Dermigny, 1994), mental stimulation, and fun(Weisman, 1983). They are passive and activeparticipants who primarily use e-mail, send pic-tures, and search for health care information(Interest Survey , 2004). And once the baby boomer generation, most of whom are already computer-literate, becomes the Medicare generation, olderadult Web use will soar. Therefore, gearing accessto and design of Web sites toward this older pop-ulation becomes an important task. Web Site DesignDesigners for Web sites sometimes fail to rec-ognize older adults as a potential user group fortheir technology. Industry has only recentlybegun adapting access to hardware and design-ing software that make accommodations for theneeds of older adults. This age group has specificabilities and performance attributes that need tobe addressed that coincide with several lifechanges. Functional limitations related tovisual, hearing, and mobility changes are com-mon among older adults as a result of bodilychanges secondary to the aging process. Thesechanges may deter their ability to use the Web.After age 65, a large proportion of this popula-tion begins to demonstrate significant visualacuity deficits. In addition, beyond age 65, onein four older adults is affected by hearing lossand some of them may develop essential benigntremor that may impair their fine motor skills(Reuben et al., 2004). Increasing font size to atleast 18 or using computer magnification screenscompensates for decreased visual acuity; usingthe Tab key or a touch screen attached to a mon-itor eliminates the necessity to have fine motorskills to move the cursor; and using externalspeakers or headphones for increased amplifica-tion can compensate for sensory and mobilityimpairments. In general, older adults are slower in using the computer (Czaja & Sharit, 1998), travel to fewerWeb pages (Liao, Groff, Chaparro, Chaparro, &Stumpfhauser, 2000), and spend more timeselecting targets for tasks than younger users(Chaparro, Bohan, Fernandez, Choi, & Kattel,1999). Many groups and researchers have devel-oped comprehensive sets of guidelines to im-prove Web design, and thus accessibility forolder adults (e.g., Web Content AccessibilityGuidelines (W3/WAI) and the government-instituted U.S. Section 508 Guidelines [GSA,2002; W3C, 2004]). The National Institute onAging (NIA) and the Library ofMedicine (NLM) advanced the above guidelines28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 574 The Internet and the World Wide Web 575 one step further by developing specifications thatare even more geared to the older adult Webuser. They published Making Your Web Site Senior Friendly: A Checklist consisting of 25 empirically based guidelines for Web sites targeting theseusers (NIA and NLM, 2002). Research in aging,Box 13-4 25 \"Senior-Friendly\" Guidelines for Web Page Construction Recommended by the National Institute on Aging 1.Phrasing: Uses the active voice. 2.Scrolling: Avoids automatically scroll- ing text and provides scrolling icon. 3.Mouse: Uses single clicks to access information. 4.Lettering: Uses upper- and lowercase for body text and reserves all capitals forheadlines. 5.Justification: Uses left-justified text. 6.Style: Uses positive phrasing and pres- ents information in a clear mannerwithout need for inferences. 7.Menus: Uses pull-down and cascading menus sparingly. 8.Simplicity: Uses simple language for text; glossary provided for technicalterms. 9.Typeface: Uses san serif typeface that is not condensed. 10.Color: Avoids using yellow, blue, and green in proximity. 11.Backgrounds: Uses light text on dark backgrounds or vice versa; avoidspatterns. 12.Consistent layout: Uses a standard page design, and navigation is the same oneach page. 13.Organization: Uses a standard format; lengthy documents are broken intoshort sections. 14.Navigation: Uses explicit step-by-step navigation procedures; simple andstraightforward.15.Help & information: Offers a tutorial on the Web site or offers contactinformation. 16.Icons & buttons: Uses large buttons; text is icon whenpossible. 17.Text alternatives: Provides text alterna- tives for all other media types. 18.Illustrations & photos: Uses text- relevant images only. 19.Type weight: Uses medium or boldface type. 20.Type size: Uses 12 or 14 point for body text. 21.Site maps: Uses a site map to show how site is organized. 22.Hyperlinks: Uses icons with text as hyperlinks. 23.Animation, video, & audio: Uses short segments to reduce download time. 24.Back/forward navigation: Uses buttons such as \"previous\" and \"next\" forreviewing text. 25.Physical spacing: Uses double spacing in body text.

These guidelines for Web site designmay result in greater accessibility to Web-basedinformation for older adults, leading to a futurewillingness to explore the Web and increasedenthusiasm toward technology.Teaching about Accessing Web SitesTo begin teaching older adults how to accessWeb sites, the nurse needs to be knowledgeableabout the capacity of the learner. The older adultmust: 1) be oriented; 2) have an attention spanand be capable of short-term memory; 3) not beagitated, combative, or destructive; and 4) beable to respond to one-step commands and makechoices. For those individuals with severe motordisability, they must be able to raise an eyebrow;puff with the mouth; or tap with a finger, foot,or talk to make selections. Adaptive or assistivedevices can be used to expedite the learningprocess. In 1991, McNeely identified eight fac-tors affecting teaching-learning outcomes forWeb-based instruction and older adults. Eachfactor is described and expanded upon in the fol-lowing list: 1. The rate of presentation of information needs to be individualized. Older adultsneed training that is self-paced andincludes ways to ask questions. Enoughtime needs to be given to perform thetask (McNeely, 1991). 2. All new information needs to be pre- sented in a highly organized manner.Initially, the task and end goals need tobe introduced. Then, parts should beidentified and each related to the pre-ceding step(s) and to the whole. Visualdisplays should be simple and demon-strate only important information.Relevant information is presented andsocial chatter is avoided to help preventthe older adult from getting distracted. 3. Older adults need to feel that they can practice as much as they like withoutslowing the pace of the instruction.Thus, older and younger adults needseparate training sessions. This will alsoprevent a situation in which olderadults would hesitate to ask questionsaround younger people for fear ofembarrassment. 4. There needs to be an opportunity for practice because it not only improveslearning and mastery, but also has adirect influence on older adults' atti-tude. Unlimited trials need to be given.Cognitive support through use of soft-ware is important, because it offers non-threatening and repetitive tutoring thatdoes not judge a person's mistakes. 5. Web use that is interesting and person- ally meaningful to the older adult hasbeen related to a positive attitudechange. Older adults should dictatewhat they need and want from the Web.People perform best when the task isrelevant to their lives. 6. Teaching older adults Web usage needs to be done in a comfortable environment. Acalm, patient, unhurried, sensitive, inter-ested, and knowledgeable instructor candecrease situational stress and promote aclimate of acceptance and reassurance. 7. Step-by-step graphic instructions or even video demonstration rather than relyingon manuals provided by vendors are help-28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 576 The Internet and the World Wide Web 577 ful in teaching older adults. Use concretelanguage as often as possible, because it isabsorbed more readily and efficiently thanabstract information. Printing a hardcopy of their work is beneficial. Seeingwork in print may increase enthusiasmand a sense of productivity and providestimulus for further participation. 8. Supportive verbal feedback may improve the older adult's performance.This should be done right after an activ-ity. Interactive feedback via Web-basedinstruction may stimulate learning(McNeely, 1991). Learning ActivitiesMany adults participate in Web-based learningactivities that lead to increased interaction andshared learning. They use the Web to createtheir own letters and use e-mail, greeting cards,and posters in addition to playing word andboard games and participating in music and artactivities. In fact, Malcolm and associates (2001)found that most physically frail older adults pri-marily used e-mail, and that they also playedgames. E-mail letters provide an opportunity toreconnect with old friends and distant family. E-mail also can be used to resolve a billing ques-tion with a cable company, find out about ser-vices at a local volunteer organization, trackdown old classmates, or request informationfrom a national organization. And it would beimpossible to overstate the satisfaction olderadults can feel when they are called \"the coolestgrandparent in the world\" because they havesent an e-mail or e-greeting card or poster to agrandchild. Online games and activities can be a fun way to engage the older person's mind when no oneelse is around. For example, Garfield (www.garfield.com) is an interactive Web site that canbe used by all ages to play games, create elec-tronic cards, or build their own comic strip.Jigzone (www.jigzone.com) is a jigsaw puzzlesite containing hundreds of picture puzzleshapes with a controlled level of difficulty. Thereare also several joke Web sites (e.g., www.jokes.com and www.joke-of-theday.com) that are funand easy to use. At the Web site www.fiftiesweb.com older adults can find the words to some ofthose common songs that they knew as youngadults. The Web fulfills older adults' needs forfun and mental stimulation. Health InformationThe emphasis on early discharge and the move-ment of care from inpatient settings to the homemandates the development of electronic infor-mation systems to augment and extend services.The use of information searching on the Web isa promising tool for older adults. Informationprovided on the Web can help to inform andeducate about acute illnesses, chronic conditions,and health promotion as well as resource avail-ability. As previously mentioned, the ABLE-DATA Web site can be used to locate companiesthat sell particular assistive devices. The Na-tional Institutes of Health and the U.S. NationalLibrary of Medicine currently maintain severalWeb sites designed to provide accurate healthinformation to consumers. MEDLINEplus (www.medlineplus.gov) has sections in English andSpanish on health topics, medications, physi-cians, and medical terminology that are easy touse and understand. Information on this site canbe accessed through alphabetical menus andthrough buttons and the search window. Thereis also a site from the National Institutes ofHealth (http://nihseniorhealth.gov) just for olderadults that contains information on age-related28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 577 578 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology Box 13-5 Research Highlight Aim: The primary aim was to test the feasibility of providing Caring~Web, a Web-based education and support intervention, to caregivers living in rural settings, including care-givers' satisfaction with the intervention. A secondary aim was to examine their experienceof caring. Introduction: After initial hospitalization and stroke rehabilitation, 80% of persons with stroke return to the community, relying on their family members' emotional, informa-tional, and instrumental support for daily living. Methods: Participants were given access to the Caring~Web site from their home via MSN/WebTV or a computer for 3 months. Each participant completed a bi-monthly tele-phone survey regarding use of Caring~Web and the experience of caring guided byFriedemann's framework of systemic organization. Data were collected from the interviewsand the e-mail communications. Nine adult caregivers of persons with stroke were enrolled during 2002-2003 in this descriptive study. They were chosen from rehabilitation centers in northwestern Ohio andsoutheastern Michigan. Caring~Web provides education and support through: 1) an opportunity to ask a nurse spe- cialist any questions; 2) a nonstructured e-mail discussion for caregivers; 3) Web sitesabout stroke; and 4) customized educational information. Procedures were tested for use in a larger study and data were collected on the use of the intervention and the experience of caring. Findings: Results indicated that all participants agreed that they were adequately trained and satisfied, in general, with Caring~Web. Seventy-eight percent of participants usedthe intervention 1-2 hours/week. Procedures were found valid for use in a larger study. Using Friedemann's framework, a coding system was developed for the qualitative e-mail data on the experience of caring. Five main themes emerged: changing roles and solvingproblems ( system change and maintenance in Friedemann's terms), seeing others' success or failure as own ( individuation ), pulling together ( coherence ( congruence ). Conclusions: These findings help expand knowledge about caregivers of persons with stroke and laid the groundwork for a larger, comprehensive examination of outcomesfrom Caring~Web and further exploration of the experience of caring. The Caring~Webintervention helped caregivers understand the myriad of educational information that isavailable, and offered emotional and social support.

The Department of Health and HumanServices (www.dhhs.gov) is a comprehensivesource on health information, diseases, aging,and a resource locator. There is a nationwidelocator service, called Eldercare Locator (www.eldercare. gov), that helps people find localservices that are provided to older adults. Userssimply enter their state and ZIP code, and theEldercare Locator will link to information,referral services, and their state and area agen-cies on aging. These programs help consumersidentify appropriate services in the area wherethey reside.28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 579 580 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology Healthcare ServicesBeyond information searches, the Internet hasother applications. For many years, traditionalface-to-face support groups facilitated by nursesand other professionals have been used extensivelywith positive outcomes for persons and their fam-ily members dealing with chronic diseases andlong-term illnesses (Broadhead & Kaplan, 1991).Web-based support groups managed by profes-sional providers, including nurses, are gainingcredibility, as positive outcomes are obtained(Larkin, 2000). Emotional and social support aregained by the participants in these Internet-basedgroups, in addition to information about besttreatments, doctors, medical centers, and more(Veggeberg, 1996). According to White andDorman (2000) and Northhouse and Peters-Golden (1993), members of Internet supportgroups share experiences and opinions that ofteninclude helping persons cope with body changesor providing encouragement to other group mem-bers, such as helping persons work through healthcare problems. For instance, national and localorganizations and medical centers offer group dis-cussion. The Wellness Community and the Uni-versity of California at San Francisco (www.twc-chat.org) are collaborating to test an online sup-port group for caregivers of persons with Park-inson's. Researchers at a medical college in Ohioare testing Caring~Web, a restricted Web sitegeared toward providing education and supportservices for caregivers of persons with stroke (seeBox 13-4). Other Web sites are interactive and include monitoring devices that enable the person tosend temperature, blood pressure, glucose levels,and other health data to health care providerselectronically. Televisual Web sites allow healthcare providers to conduct virtual house calls witholder adults (Spry Foundation, 2005). For exam-ple, Brennan et al. (2001) demonstrated theeffectiveness of computer-mediated informationand support services for patients recoveringfrom coronary artery bypass graft surgery, andMcKay, Glasgow, Feil, Boles, and Barrera(2002) suggested that Web-based informationand support interventions exert a positive im-pact on health-promoting behaviors of patientswith Type 2 diabetes. Technologies on the Horizon A number of organizations are testing computer-based technologies. These technologies have thepotential to provide help for people dealingwith chronic illness and disability. The practi-cal application of these technologies may beespecially important for older adults and theircaregivers living in community settings. Robotic Assistance Two factors suggest that now is the time toestablish mobile robots in the home-care arena.First, technology is available to develop robotsthat exhibit the necessary power, reliability, andlevel of competence. Second, now more thanever, there is a need for cost-effective solutionsto maintain older adults in home settings.Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh,University of Michigan, and Carnegie MellonUniversity (2005) are collaborating to producea personal robotic assistant for older adultscalled Nursebot. The goal of this project is todevelop mobile personal service robots thatassist older adults suffering from chronic disor-ders in their everyday life. An autonomousmobile robot \"lives\" in the private home of achronically ill person. The robot provides aresearch platform on which to test out a rangeof ideas for assisting these adults, such as: 28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 580 Technologies on the Horizon 581 1.Intelligent reminding: Many older adults have to give up independent livingbecause of memory loss. They forget tovisit the restroom, to take medicine, todrink, or to see the doctor. One projectexplores the effectiveness of a roboticreminder, which follows people around,so they cannot become lost. 2.Tele-presence: Professional caregivers can use the robot to establish a \"tele-presence\" and interact directly withremote care recipients. This makesmany doctor visits unnecessary. 3.Data collection and surveillance: Robots can be used for a wide range of emer-gency conditions that can be avoidedwith systematic data collection (e.g.,certain types of heart failures). 4.Mobile manipulation: A semi-intelligent mobile manipulator integrates roboticstrength with a person's senses andintellect. This mobile manipulation canovercome barriers in handling objects(e.g., refrigerator, laundry, andmicrowave) that currently force olderadults to move into assisted-living facil-ities. This technology could be used forany person dealing with function prob-lems, such as arthritis, as the main rea-son for giving up independent living. 5.Social interaction deprivation: This affects a huge number of elderly people who areforced to live alone. This project seeks toexplore whether robots can take over cer-tain social functions for these older adults. If this project is successful, it could change the way health care is delivered to an ever-growingcontingent of older adults, while significantlyadvancing the state of the art for mobile servicerobotics and human robot interaction (Univer-sity of Pittsburgh, University of Michigan, andCarnegie Mellon University, 2005). Sensor-Based Monitoring Medical Automation Research Center (MARC),at the University of Virginia, has developed andis testing technological solutions for in-homedistance monitoring of the functional abilities ofolder adults. The goal of this system is to enableolder adults with disabilities to remain in theirown homes for as long as possible. The systemis composed of unobtrusive and low-cost sensors(no cameras or microphones) that detect move-ment and pressure. There is a data logging andcommunications module, in addition to an inte-grated data management system, linked to theInternet. Using the appropriate data analysistools, important observations about activities ofdaily living can be made from the data generatedby the monitored person. These observationsmay yield early indicators of the onset of a dis-ease or a sudden change of activity (or inactivity)that can indicate an accident. Although the sys-tem is not meant as an emergency promptsystem, the caregiver may receive alerts over theInternet or urgent notifications over the phonein case of such sudden accident-indicatingchanges. Additionally, there is a potential forinformation about sickness or accidents to betransmitted immediately to a service provider(MARC, 2005). Intel's Assistance Program The Alzheimer's Association and Intel Corpo-ration have formed a consortium to spur devel-opment of technologies for the home to helpsupport the care of older adults. This groupgrew out of several separate and ongoing efforts.In 2001, the Alzheimer's Association conveneda group of caregivers as well as experts fromdiverse disciplines including bioengineering,28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 581 582 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology robotics, artificial intelligence, communica-tions, systems design, software engineering,medicine, nursing, biology, economics, finance,and business. Around the same time, Intelfunded and conducted research on the ways inwhich computing and communications tech-nologies could support the daily health andwellness needs of people of all ages in theirhomes and everyday lives. An example of Intel'stechnology is a wireless \"sensor network\" madeup of thousands of small sensing devices thatcould someday be embedded throughout thehome to monitor important behavioral tenden-cies, such as sleep and eating patterns. It couldalso send prompts to a person, such as remindersto take medication. Working together, one pro-gram that they are designing is to help personswith early-stage Alzheimer's disease to eat anddrink while living in a home setting (AssistedLiving, 2003). Summary Today's technologies provide many opportuni-ties for older adults to maintain their inde-pendence and stay connected to the world evenwhen functional limitations are present. Nursesshould be aware of the latest trends in technol-Box 13-6 Research Highlight Aim: Using Friedemann's framework of systemic organization as a guide, this secondary analysis of data explored the narrative discussions of three older men caring for womenwith stroke. Methods: The men participated for 3 months during January-September 2002 in Caring~Web, which provides Web-based support. These men were part of a larger study(n/H1100510) examining the experience of caring for individuals with stroke. The sample was composed of three men, two spouses and one live-in friend, from northwestern Ohio andsoutheastern Michigan. Data were collected from bi-monthly interviews and e-mail dis-cussions among the caregivers. Analysis of these qualitative data ( n/H11005224 entries) fol- lowed established protocols; that is, data were reviewed as they were communicated andfocused not only on individual semantic units, but also on zones of association. Findings: Results revealed that these men were primarily dealing with role changes ( system change in Friedemann's terms) and the women's depression and irritability ( incongruence ). The stroke event also fostered closer family ties and \"being there\" for one another ( togeth- erness ). Additionally, these men were supportive of each other as caregivers via the online discussion group. Conclusions: Nursing practice on the Internet is mostly uncharted territory. These results begin to explore the complex experience of men caring for women with stroke. Source: Pierce, L., & Steiner, V . (2004). What are male caregivers talking about?

In addition,nurses can use the strategies suggested in thischapter to enhance learning and teaching witholder adults by incorporating technology intothe care of both well and ill elderly. Critical Thinking Exercises 1. If someone stopped you on the street and demanded to know your definition of the Internet and World Wide Web, what would you say? Define the Internet in your ownwords. How is the Web different from the Internet? Discuss your findings withanother student nurse in one of your clinical groups. 2. Explore the following Web sites: American Stroke Association (www.american stroke.org) and National Stroke Association (www.stroke.org). What are differencesand similarities between these Web sites? Discuss your findings with another studentnurse in one of your clinical groups. 3. Discuss with students in your clinical group at least two factors affecting teaching- learning outcomes for Web-based instruction and older adults. 4. Describe an assistive device to students in your clinical group, and tell how you would teach the patient and/or caregiver about its use when discharging a patient to a homesetting. 5. How can information be located about the assistive technology and assistive devices currently available for consumers' use? Personal Reflection 1. Do you know an older adult who is a novice computer user? Interview this person: Ask how his or her life has changed (what is better and/or worse) since becoming auser. Think about how these changes may affect his or her quality of life. 2. How do you feel about older adults becoming part of the technology revolution? Do you feel that they are using the computer and World Wide Web more often? Do youknow any older adults who use iPods, MP3 players, PDAs, Flash drives, or other gad-gets used by the younger population today? How is their use the same as or different from your generation?28438_CH13_561_586.qxd 6/7/06 12:14 PM Page 583 584 Chapter 13: Using Assistive Technology Glossary Assistive device: Any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commerciallyoff the shelf, modified, or customized, that is usedto increase, maintain, or improve functional capa-bilities of individuals with disabilities. Assistive technology: Technological tools used to access education, employment, recreation, or communi-cation, enabling someone to live as independentlyas possible. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC): All forms of communication that enhance or supplement speech and writing, either tem-porarily or permanently orthat involve the use of personalized methods or devices to aid a person'sability to communicate. Emergency response system (ERS): A device that evalu- ates self-care and/or physiologic parameters andallows a person at high risk (for example an olderperson who lives alone and has a health problem) toget immediate help in the event of an emergency.Environmental controls: Electronic systems that allow individuals to control lights, heating and cooling,and just about any electrical piece of equipment,such as curtains, garage doors, and gates, from aremote location. Internet: A vast collection of resources that includes people, information, and multimedia and is bestcharacterized as the biggest labyrinth of computernetworks on earth. Nursing informatics: A blending of computer, infor- mation, and nursing science designed to assist inthe management and processing of nursing data,information, and knowledge to support the prac-tice of nursing and the delivery of nursing care.

It is not possible tocare for this population without being faced withdifficult choices surrounding issues relating to theability to live independently. Independence in thecommunity requires some level of self-sufficiencyin the management of medications, health care,driving, and maintaining and running a home(self-care, pet care, meals, housekeeping, shop-ping, banking, etc.). Self-sufficiency, issues offinance, and personal choices directly impact ad-herence to a plan of care. These basic issues of autonomy are further challenged by the effects of aging and chronicdisease on cognitive functioning and decisionmaking. Advance directives, informed consent,and refusal of treatment are dependent on clar-ity of mind. Difficult choices call for judgmentsand serious consideration of what is right or bestfor patients, their families, and their communi-ties. These personal choices are further com-pounded by social pressures associated withtechnological developments, options for end-of-life care, genetic research, and resource alloca-tion. Technology and science have movedforward at their own paces without concern forconsequences, asking not if something isneeded, only whether or not it can be done(Coverston & Rogers, 2000).Ethical concepts are principles that facilitate decision making and guide our professionalbehavior. They evolve from our beliefs and val- uesand therefore have their foundations in reli- gion, culture, and family expectations. Ethicaldecision making is driven by moral reasoning\u2014our determination of what is right and wrong.Ethical concepts and personal values define ourcharacter and are expressed in our conduct andactions. Professional codes or standards withinthe profession of nursing help to define ethicalactions. Changes in our social networks, includ-ing global awareness, cultural diversity, andadvances in science, medicine, and technology,have created increasingly complex conflicts anddilemmas. Therefore, nurses must have a clearunderstanding of their own values and a strat-egy for decision making because personal beliefsmay be quite different from the patient's, fromthe organization's values and expectations, orfrom the community's public rules. Conflict and Dilemma Conflict occurs when a choice must be made between two equal possibilities. Three types ofmoral conflict are described by Redman & Fry(1998). Moral distress occurs when someone wants to do the right thing but is limited by theconstraints of the organization or society. Moral uncertainty defines the confusion surrounding situations in which a person is uncertain whatthe moral problem is or which moral principlesor values apply to it. A moral dilemma arises when two or more moral principles apply that28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 590 support mutually inconsistent actions. A truedilemma occurs when it appears there are no acceptable choices. To qualify as a dilemma,there must be active engagement in the situa-tion that forces an evaluation of and need forchoices. Actions are uncertain because alterna-tives are equally unattractive (Sletteboe, 1997).Case Study 14-1 provides an example of a dilemma. Dilemmas are inherent in the health care of the geriatric population, creating ethical prob-lems for those providing care. Differences in val-ues and opinions can lead to conflicts betweencaregivers and health care providers and is morecommon in diverse communities where culturalvalues may be quite different (Ellis & Hartley,2004). There are seldom perfect solutions toethical dilemmas. Those forced to make themare often required to justify their decisions andactions. Some conflicts are resolved through dia-logue, others are legislated, and others aredefined by agreements regarding basic rights.Many health care organizations utilize ethicscommittees to resolve such dilemmas in realtime. Moral Principles Moral principles are incorporated into profes- sional codes of ethics , organizational value statements, and position statements publishedby professional groups such as the AmericanNurses Association (ANA). The ANA posts theCode of Ethics for Nurses on its Web site at www.nursingworld.org/ethics/ecode.htm. Thiscode forms the cornerstone of nursing practice.The purpose of this code is to provide nurseswith tools for identifying ethical responsibilitiesand to guide decision making within the pri-mary goals, values, and obligations of the pro-fession (Hook & White, 2003). The ANA hasissued many position statements speaking toethics and human rights, and is currently activein addressing issues of genetic research, confi-dentiality, privacy, managed care, health servicesfor undocumented persons, and the system'simpact on the profession of nursing using moralprinciples and Nursing's Agenda for Health Care Reform as a guide for action (ANA, 2005b). A nurse's understanding of moral principles facil-itates ethical decision making in daily practice. Advocacy Advocacy refers to loyalty and a championing of the needs and interests of others requiring thenurse to educate patients and their families sothat they know their rights, are fully informed,and are able to access all the benefits they areentitled to (Hoeman & Duchene, 2002). Advo-cacy is implicit in the social contract between theprofession of nursing and society and is based onother ethical concepts such as justice and auton-omy (Falk Rafael, 1995). Our increasingly com-plex health care system often calls for advocacyMoral Principles 591 Box 14-1 Moral Principles AdvocacyAutonomyBeneficence/nonmaleficenceConfidentialityFidelityFiduciary PM Page 591 592 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues efforts to help patients and families negotiate itand receive appropriate services. Nurses alsoadvocate for patients by supporting them in theirefforts to retain as much autonomy as their abil-ities allow. At times, nurses advocate for theexpressed desires of the patient within the con-text of team and family discussions in which thepatient is not present, assuring true representa-competence questioned prior to takingthis stand. Some of the staff supports his deci- sion and others do not. Discussion withthe family reveals that Mr. Bowen hasfrequently made deriding remarks aboutpersons with disability, includingremarks like \"If I ever end up that way,just take me out behind the barn andshoot me.\" The psychologist commentsthat Mr. Bowen is frankly depressed andthat part of this depression is related tothe location of his stroke. He also pointsout that he feels strongly that should thedepression be resolved, Mr. Bowenwould likely change his opinion. 1. How is this situation best handled? 2. Does Mr. Bowen have the right to refuse to eat and take medica-tions when he is clearly not inan end-of-life situation? 3. How does the team resolve the situation when the depression isso prevalent and he refusestreatment for it? 4. Will you be able to care for Mr. Bowen if his wishes are granted?Mr. Bowen is 64 years old. He has been very healthy by report and veryactive working as a dairy farmer. Hehad a stroke affecting his right side 2weeks ago and currently has a moderateleg weakness with a more significantarm weakness, slurred speech, and milddysphagia (swallowing difficulty). He ispredicted to be ambulatory with a cane,though prognosis of arm function re-turning is more guarded. It is likely hewill improve speech function and swal-lowing ability but will require some spe-cialization of diet to prevent aspiration. Mr. Bowen has chosen to stop eating, stating that he does not want to live asan invalid. His family is very distressedand wants him to be forced to eat. Theycannot imagine why he has made thischoice when his prognosis is so goodcompared to others they have seen inthe rehabilitation setting with muchmore severe deficits. He has been eval-uated for depression and an antidepres-sant has been recommended, which herefuses to take along with all othermedications recommended for his newlydiagnosed cardiovascular disease. Mr.Bowen is oriented and has not had Case Study 14-128438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 592 Moral Principles 593 tion of the patient's desires when known. Othersituations require advocacy efforts to preventabuse, neglect, and exploitation. Advocacy also refers to maintaining the sta- tus of safe care. The nurse is committed to thewell-being of the patient and thus must takeappropriate action in the event that incompe-tent, illegal, unethical, or impaired practice putsa patient at risk. Nurses are obligated to addressthe issue with the person involved and, if nec-essary, with higher authorities so that patientsare not placed in jeopardy (ANA, 2005a). Mosthealth care organizations have processes in placefor reporting and managing such behaviors.Utilization of official channels reduces the riskof reprisal against the reporting nurse (ANA,2005a). Autonomy Autonomy is the concept that each person has a right to make independent choices and deci-sions. It is reflected in guidelines and lawsregarding patient rights and self-determination.Inherent in the concept of autonomy is respectfor another and their decisions and that eachperson should be treated with dignity as aunique individual with inherent worth. Evi-dence of respect for autonomy is found in carethat considers the patient's lifestyle, value sys-tem, and religious beliefs. Such respect does notmean that the nurse condones those beliefs orchoices, but rather that the nurse respects thepatient as a person with autonomy and rights(ANA, 2005a). Autonomy may be limited bycognitive deficits that impair clarity of thoughtand the ability of the patient to make decisions. Autonomous choices are based on values and experiences. In order for patients and their fam-ilies to make sound choices, they must have ap-propriate resources and information available.Thus, autonomy is supported by informed con- sent and patient and family education. Informed consent means making sure that consent hasbeen granted, not assumed, following an educa-tional process that facilitates the weighing ofbenefits, risks, and available options (Aveyard,2005). Informed consent is not compliance, butassuring that voluntariness is honored. Although consent is not required for routine activities for which the risks are commonly un-derstood, patients often comply with actionsand activities during nursing care proceduresbecause they believe that that is what is ex-pected of them (Quallich, 2004). This does notmean that they have provided informed consentfor those activities not considered routine by thepatient. All too often nurses discover thatpatients do not really understand why they are Box 14-2 Informed Consent Elements to include in discussion: The specific condition requiring treatment The purpose and distinct nature of the procedure or treatment Potential complications or risks associ- ated with the procedure or treatment Reasonable alternatives with a discus- sion of their relative risks and benefits Discussion of the option of taking no action The probability of success of the recom- mended treatment or procedure Source: Adapted from Quallich, S. A. (2004). The practice of informed con-sent. Urologic Nursing, 24 (6), 513-515.28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 593 594 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues doing something that was prescribed by a healthcare provider. We often err by assuming they un-derstood and provided consent because they wereparticipating (Aveyard, 2005). Unmistakably, autonomy also means that nurses and other health professionals can edu-cate, provide support, and provide resources, butthey cannot force compliance with recommendedtreatment. Thus, it is important to recognizethat informed consent also means that consentcan be denied, can be withdrawn after it hasbeen given, and that such requests should berespectfully honored. Refusal of treatment is apatient right. Care should be taken that healthcare providers do not abuse their power in therelationship by persuading patients to complywith recommended treatment. Patients andtheir families have been badgered into agreeingto an intervention that they did not want topursue (Aveyard, 2005). It is important to rec-ognize the impact of previous experiences onchoices made by patients and to actively addressbarriers through support and education. Conflicts around autonomy can occur with issues of chronic or life-threatening illness,when patients and family members fail to con-form to expected behavior patterns, or whenthey disagree with the recommendations of pro-fessionals. Patients are labeled noncompliantand families are labeled dysfunctional. Pater- nalism has been prevalent in the medical field, and health care providers, including nurses, areat risk for paternalistic behavior when patientsare perceived as difficult to work with. Pater-nalism is easily supported by the distribution ofpower in relationships with patients and fami-lies in many health care settings. Paternalismfails to support autonomy and limits the devel-opment of trusting partnerships. The best out-comes are achieved when autonomy is supportedthrough a shared responsibility for decision mak-ing that allows the patient and family to bevested in the plan. The burden of health care has been steadily shifting to the community. Nurses and otherhealth care providers are wise to invest in thedevelopment of strong relationships and part-nerships with family caregivers. This ethic ofnegotiation and accommodation means provid-ing information in a timely manner in a waythat is easily understood. It means taking thetime to prepare and train the patient and care-giver for both the technical and emotional as-pects of their changing roles. And, it meansbeing compassionate about their anxiety, suffer-ing, and hard work. Caregivers need direction,guidance, and support in defining their rolesand responsibilities in patient care and decisionmaking. They also need support and permissionto set fair limits on their sacrifices, supportingtheir autonomy and conditions of choice (Levine,2000). Beneficence/Nonmaleficence These concepts of do good (beneficence ) and do no harm (nonmaleficence ) are integral to health care. Nurses intend to do good for their patients.Nurses are also concerned about situations thatcan result in harm to patients, such as under-staffing. Consider the situation on a busy med-ical unit where a nurse does a cursory assessmentdue to workload demands and the apparent com-fort of the patient on rounds. The patient is avery social and talkative elderly woman who hashad a recent crisis with heart failure and is hav-ing her medications adjusted. She has becomesignificantly deconditioned and has spent muchof the last couple of weeks in her recliner prior toadmission. Near the end of the shift the patientcomplains of severe chest pain and anxiety. An28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 594 Moral Principles 595 emergent work-up determines that she has adeep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embo-lism. Is this an example of maleficence (doingharm)? Obviously, purposeful behavior such asadministering a lethal dose of medication is anexample of maleficence, but where does failureto rescue fall on the ethical scale? Failure to rescue refers to effectiveness in rescuing a patient from a complication versuspreventing a complication (National QualityMeasures Clearing House, 2005). A summary ofdata compiled in 1997 by the Healthcare Costand Utilization Project State Inpatient Databasefor 19 states showed a failure to rescue rate of148.4 per 1,000 persons at risk (National Qual-ity Measures Clearing House). Failure to rescuedata are collected by measuring the number ofdeaths occurring out of those discharges withpotential complications of care listed in the fail-ure to rescue definitions (pneumonia, deep veinthrombosis/pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acuterenal failure, shock/cardiac arrest, or gastroin-testinal hemorrhage/acute ulcer). It is a patientsafety quality monitor for the Institutes of Healthand Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.Failure to rescue has many causes, from situationsas simple as educational background, inexperi-ence, and lack of knowledge to more complexissues such as attitudes towards work, staffing pat-terns, and resource allocation ( Case Study 14-2 ). It can be an issue of omission as much as an issueof commission. It behooves all nurses to thinkcarefully about the issue of failure to rescue and toinvestigate practice situations so that such cir-cumstances are not issues of maleficence. Confidentiality The ANA Code of Ethics (2001) emphasizesrespect for human dignity that is demonstratedin daily work. This includes respect for privacy him. Discussion with the patient noteda history of sleep apnea that appeared tobe worsened by the effects of the painmedication. 1. Was this a near miss or failure to rescue? 2. Did the night shift nurse adhere to principles of beneficence andnonmaleficence? 3. What should the nurse have done differently?Mr. Jacobs, a young-acting 72-year- old who is rather obese, was admittedfor trauma following a motorcycle acci-dent in which he broke his femur. He is24 hours post op and has requestedpain meds at 0400. The medicationswere given, and the nurse glanced in theroom 2 hours later and noted he ap-peared to be sleeping. At 0700, thenurse on the next shift enters the roomand turns on the light to see the patientis cyanotic and difficult to arouse. Ag-gressive stimulation and oxygen revivedCase Study 14-228438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 595 596 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues and maintaining confidentiality . There is so much value placed on the concept of confiden-tiality that it is considered a right\u2014the right toprivacy. The right to privacy has been inferredfrom the U.S. constitution but has been legis-lated more directly in recent years by the HealthInsurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA). Driving forces for these laws relate to the spread of socially stigmatized diseases such asAIDS and concerns over the large volumes ofinformation transmitted electronically contain-ing sensitive material, detailed descriptions ofinteractions with health care workers, andgenetic data that can result in potential inva-sions of privacy or be utilized for discriminationin the workplace or denial of insurance coverage(Ellis & Hartley, 2004). HIPAA requires thatproviders educate their patients regarding theirrights under HIPAA and that they release onlyinformation that the patient specifically desig-nates as sharable with others. HIPAA regula-tions protect privacy so strongly that evenadmitting that the patient is in your care is aviolation unless the patient has expressly agreedthat such information can be shared. This haschanged many practices related to confidential-ity in health care settings. HIPAA has legislated the concept of confi- dentiality inherent in practice by requiring thatonly persons with a need to know access thepatient's record or receive information about thepatient. Nurses are entrusted with personalinformation in the course of providing care thatshould be shared only as necessary to facilitatethat patient's care. In addition to the personalresponsibility for protecting privacy, legal ram-ifications for failure to comply with this law aresteep; the nurse should be well informed oforganizational guidelines for compliance withthis regulation. Health care providers can beheld liable for harm that results from sharinginformation without permission. Nurses shouldbe able to easily access appropriate administra-tive personnel in the event that a request forpatient information is questionable.

Fidelity isalso important in relationships with team mem-bers and the organization at which the nurseworks. The team and the organization need tobe able to trust the nurse to keep promises andhonor relationships with them. Trust is earned,and fidelity is demonstrated in daily work andthe relationships therein. Fiduciary Responsibility In this age of diminishing health care resources itis important that all nurses have an understand-ing of the costs and benefits of care that is given.Health care professionals have an ethical obliga-tion to good stewardship of both the patient's andthe organization's funds\u2014 fiduciary responsibil- ity. This refers to using both fiscal reserves and caregiving resources wisely, potentially requiringa cost-benefit analysis to facilitate decision mak- ing. It becomes more difficult to deal with personswho are noncompliant or who have conditionsthat could have been prevented through healthierlifestyles as resources and manpower decline(Hoeman & Duchene, 2002). For many, rehabili-tation and other special health care programs arenot a right, they are a privilege that is rationedand controlled by those who control funding. Justice Fiduciary responsibility and fidelity are some ofthe moral principles that help to determinewhat is just. Justice refers to the fairness of an act or situation. Health care is replete withissues of justice. Is it just for one patient toreceive rehabilitation following a stroke andanother to be sent to a nursing home withoutacute rehabilitation? Is it just for a person whohas attempted suicide and severely damaged hisliver to receive a transplant before another whohas been patiently waiting for the same liver?Who decides what is just and right? Does agemake a difference? Why should one person re-ceive more resources than another? Is the gov-ernment responsible for providing resources tothose unable to provide for themselves? Many geriatric patients depend on Medicare and Medicaid for insurance, so nurses in thefield of geriatrics should conscientiously followthe government's efforts to determine just dis-tribution of its dollars. The Medicare Prospec-tive Payment System has been mandated by theBalanced Budget Act of 1997 and requires strictaccounting for where its dollars go in postacutecare. This has led to a redistribution of servicesand limiting of access to home health, outpa-tient, and rehabilitation services for the geriatricpopulation. This situation quickly reinforces the issue of access, of whether we all deserve the same sortof care and who should decide what that careshould be. Care of geriatric patients is burdenedwith age-related biases regarding resource allo-cation and rationales for resource allotment.Resources are limited. Elderly persons are usu-ally on fixed incomes with restricted benefitsand strict criteria for access to services, especiallysupportive assistance in the home. This increasesthe burden on caregivers, creating a difficult,isolated, and often unsupported role (Hoeman& Duchene, 2002). Success in this role is furtherhampered by the complexities of the system andlimitations on time spent with patients andcaregivers. Levine (2000) comments that caregivers la- mented the incomplete information they receivedregarding basic information about diagnosis andprognosis, key elements of the treatment plan,side effects of medication, symptoms to watch forat home, and whom to call for assistance or prob-28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 597 598 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues lems. Others have reported difficulties with com-pliance and learning about their loved one's careneeds due to conflicting information from healthcare providers. One also has to question the jus-tice in a system that impairs the caregiver's abil-ity to learn because professionals share informationin such hurried and technical manners that anx-ious and stressed caregivers can hardly be expectedto absorb it (Levine, 2000). These failures incommunication hardly support a fair or just healthcare system; rather, they contribute to seriousproblems that can increase both morbidity andmortality. Quality and Sanctity of Life The issues of justice and access to care remind usthat many decisions regarding self-determina-tion and autonomy are related to quality of life , or one's personal perception of the conditions oflife, and sanctity of life, referring to the value of life and the right to live. Quality of life is a per-ception based on personal values and beliefs.Views on quality of life are widely variable andlikely to change when circumstances differ. Theyare influenced by emotional, physical, economic,and social needs. Quality of life is enhanced byprevention and management of chronic diseasethrough preventive care, support for healthylifestyle choices, education, and home evaluationsto reduce risk of injury. However, even the bestnurse cannot prevent injury or reduce risk ofcomplications in those who continue to makeunhealthy choices or fail to heed health or safetyrecommendations (Hoeman & Duchene, 2002).Some quality-of-life decisions are made in directrelation to the burden being placed on others.Sometimes it is not the big things such as limi-tations in mobility that cause the greatest bur-den on quality of life, but rather the indignityand emotional burden associated with problemssuch as incontinence and dependency. Sanctity of life supports the belief that all life is of value and that this value is not based onhow functional or effective a person's life is, sim-ply that we all have a right to life. The meetingof personal perspectives on quality and sanctityof life can thus be expressed in an individual'sadvance directives. Conflicts in health care arerife with issues related to values surroundingsanctity of life and end-of-life care issues. TheANA (2005a) has addressed this directly in theCode of Ethics for Nurses , stating that nurses may not act with intent to end life but may supportand act on well-thought-out decisions regardingresuscitation status, withholding and withdraw-ing of life-sustaining care including nutritionand hydration, and aggressively managing painand other symptoms at the end of life even ifsuch care hastens death. Reciprocity Reciprocity is a feature of integrity concerned with the ability to be true to one's self whilerespecting and supporting the values and viewsof another. Living according to this principle isparticularly important when values and viewsare different. Nurses need to be impartial oncea plan of care is agreed on, actively facilitatingachievement of intended goals and outcomes.Passive resistance does not support reciprocityor trust. If a nurse or other health care providercannot demonstrate reciprocity, another shouldtake his or her place in the care of the patient. Veracity Veracity means truthfulness and refers to telling the truth, or, at the very least, not misleading ordeceiving patients or their families. Veracity formsthe basis of informed consent\u2014without truthful-ness and an explanation of options, the patientcannot possibly make the best choice. Failure tobe truthful impairs trust and reliability (Ellis &28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 598 Patient Rights 599 Hartley, 2004). But issues of truthfulness createconflict as well. Do you tell the truth when youknow it will cause harm or distress? How do youmaintain hope while sharing a poor prognosis? Itis possible to support hopefulness and decreasestress with truthfulness through careful choices ofwords. It is as simple as the difference betweensimply stating, \"You will not likely walk againconsidering the severity of this stroke\" and com-passionately saying \"It will take considerable workand fortunate healing of your brain in order foryou to walk again, but we will work with you andsee what happens.\" Patient Rights Patient rights direct actions on ethical issues in the care of geriatric populations. The concept ofrights forms the basis of many of our laws and isindeed the basis for the foundation of the U.S.constitution. Rights are considered basic tohuman life, and each person is entitled to themon a legal, moral, or ethical basis (Ellis & Hartley,2004). Over the last several decades considerableeffort has been put into defining patient's rights.These rights are defined by organizational values,accreditation standards, professional codes, andlegislative guidelines. The American HospitalAssociation has published a document addressingpatient rights and hospital responsibility, entitledThe Patient Care Partnership: Understanding Ex-pectations, Rights and Responsibilities, in an effort to define these rights and to hold hospitals and pa-tients accountable to them. This document isavailable at www.aha.org/aha/ptcommunication/partnership/index.html. Rights also evolve as values within a cultural or social group change. The right to decide whatcan and cannot be done to a person evolved as alegal definition due to a malpractice lawsuit in1957 (Quallich, 2004). The right to effectivepain management has evolved due to changes inperception and studies assessing the impact ofpoor pain management on outcomes. Thisdevelopment was supported by the Joint Com-mission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organi-zations (JCAHO) when it added accreditationstandards related to effective pain managementand by rulings of the courts related to failure tomanage terminal pain (Furrow, 2001). Advance Directives and Living Wills The most fundamental patient right is the rightto decide. The Patient Self-Determination Act of1990 was enacted to reduce the risk that lifewould be shortened or prolonged against thewishes of the individual. Following the belief thateach has a fundamental right to decide (auton-omy), this law requires that patients are providedthe opportunity to express their preferences re-garding life-saving or life-sustaining care on en-tering any health care service, including hospitals,long-term care centers, and home care agencies.The law also requires that adequate informationbe supplied to the patient so that informed deci-sions regarding self-determination are made. Decisions regarding life-saving or life- sustaining care are recorded in legal documentsknown as advance directives. Advance direc- tives describe actions to be taken in a situationwhere the patient is no longer able to provideinformed consent. Living wills are alternativedocuments that direct preferences for end-of-life care issues . type of care toprovide and whether resuscitation measuresshould be taken. The \"if\" condition (e.g., If Iam terminally ill and not expected to recover)must be confirmed by a physician (Ellis &Hartley, 2004). Laws vary from state to stateregarding living wills, and some require two28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 599 600 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues physicians to agree to the status of the patientbefore enacting directives. In states where liv-ing wills have been enacted into law, healthcare providers who do not agree with apatient's directives must remove themselvesfrom the case (Ellis & Hartley, 2004). Remem-ber that living wills are equally as likely toindicate that resuscitation efforts be limited asthey are that all possible efforts be taken. Durable Power of Attorney A living will may include a durable power ofattorney, a legal document designating an al-ternative decision maker in the event that theperson is incapacitated. This document super-sedes all other general legal designations fordecision makers. In other words, a patient maydesignate a close friend with durable power ofattorney, superseding the designation of im-mediate family members in decision makingin a situation where the patient is incapaci-tated. The living will in this situation pro-vides direction to the decision maker. The useof a durable power of attorney can decreaseconflicts between family members and allowsthe designated decision maker to perform inroles negotiated in advance with the patient(Ellis & Hartley, 2004). The absence of a living will or \"do not resusci- tate\" order requires that all possible efforts atresuscitation should be initiated. Care of the inca-pacitated person is greatly simplified by anadvance directive or living will. However, theissues of paternalism and boundary violations cancause ethical conflicts in the pursuit of such direc-tives if not handled empathetically. It is impera-tive that information be supplied in an ethicallyappropriate manner for each patient because themanner in which alternatives are discussed greatlyinfluences choices made (Elliot & Hartley, 2004).Cultural values influence decisions made as wellas the way in which decisions are made. Whereasone family may see the decision as solely up to theindividual involved, others may feel it is a familydecision because of duty, compassion, or the con-cern of those ultimately assuming the burden ofcare. The nurse supports the preferences of thepatient in resolving self-determination issues. Competence Competence refers to one's clarity and appro- priateness in decision making. Competencemust be present for persons to exercise auton-omy and their right to decide. Inherent inautonomy is the right to choose, the right to beinformed, and the right to refuse treatment,including whether to participate in research.Loss of competence due to impaired memory orsensory function significantly impacts one'sability to make such informed decisions. Thereis a difference between being declared legallyincompetent and situations of evidence ofimpaired competence that may be transient dueto health problems or side effects of medica-tions. Legal competence is determined by thecourts, and if a person is deemed legally incom-petent a legal guardian is appointed. Informed consent means that the person clearly understands the choices offered. Prob-lems develop when one no longer has the capac-ity to make health care decisions. Nurses shouldinvolve patients in the planning of their ownhealth care to the extent that they are able toparticipate. But what do we do when the patientis confused and refusing care that is necessary forboth comfort and health? Do we perform thatcare against the person's will, documenting thatclarity of thought was limited? We do. Underour ethical standards, we are equally obligatedto provide the best care under the circumstances(ANA, 2005a). This default condition becomesuncomfortable for many nurses when the patient28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 600 Ethics in Practice 601 is combative or agitated with the care beingdelivered (Aveyard, 2005). Discomfort can bereduced and confidence in proceeding enhancedby discussing such care with designated decisionmakers. Each state has laws indicating who isdesignated as a decision maker in the event aperson becomes confused, unconscious, or con-sidered incompetent to make informed deci-sions. Organizational guidelines are establishedin line with these laws to guide staff in man-agement of such situations. If a physician deter-mines that a person is no longer competent forsuch decision making, it should be noted inwriting with an explanation of the probablecause and its likely duration. This allows thenurse to follow legal and institutional guide-lines for using an advance directive or alterna-tive decision maker (Butler, 2004). Assisted Suicide Another ethical issue of self-determination andautonomy is that of assisted suicide. As Hoemanand Duchene (2002) comment, if \"social valuesdictate beliefs about self-determination and lifesatisfaction, persons with chronic, disabling dis-orders are at risk for promoted suicide even ifthey are not terminally ill. Hospice and pallia-tive care are rejected in favor of aids to rapiddeath\" (p. 53). Refusal of treatment is considereda right and protected under self-determinationdirectives. The recent movement towards legis-lation regarding assisted suicide forces the judg-ment of when suicide should be used on the basisof health status, age, or other attributes andcounters the ethical principle on which self-determination is based (Hoeman & Duchene,2002). Does this create the potential of targetingthose with severe disabilities whether the condi-tion is terminal or not? Does it create a doublestandard for treatment and survival? Is it a planof managing devalued persons (Hoeman &Duchene)? The ANA published a statement onassisted suicide in 1994 and does not support itin any form, stating that it is a violation of theCode for Nurses. Instead, it is suggested thatnurses focus on providing competent, compre-hensive, and compassionate end-of-life care (ANA,1994). Chapter 22 of this text focuses on suchcare of elders at end of life. Ethics in Practice Ethical dilemmas and conflicts surround us in reallife, and ethical principles alone are not likely toaddress many of the quandaries and dilemmasoccurring in the care of geriatric patients. Livingby these principles requires reflection and consid-eration of one's own beliefs and how they interfacewith the professional code of ethics, organizationalstatements, and beliefs of patients in the com-munity in which the nurse practices. Nurses mustprepare for such dilemmas by considering theinfluence of their own personal values, attitudes,and expectations about aging on the care of olderadults and their families. Without such reflec-tions, the patient may lose autonomy, the right toself-determination, and justice. Nurses must learn how to assess competency as related to specific features of care in the geri-Box 14-4 Recommended Reading Mathes, M. (2004). Ethical decision mak- ing and nursing.

Developing skills in probing theexpressed wishes of patients and advocating forthose wishes to be followed facilitates respect andthe honoring of self-determination. Nurses alsoneed to recognize that clarity of thought is fluidand lucid moments can return or appear. Thesemoments should be recognized and viewed asopportunities for discussion. Nurses, as patientadvocates, also bear responsibility for effectivecommunication of a patient's preferences throughdocumentation and reporting processes. They arealso responsible for creatively thinking about andproblem-solving situations that limit functionalstatus and safety to support quality of life andindependent living. Nurses caring for childrenand younger adults bear a responsibility to facil-itate healthy life choices to minimize futurehealth complications, including being good rolemodels of healthy behaviors themselves. Mistakes Mistakes happen, and happened more often thanthe public was aware of prior to the 2000 reportby the Institute of Medicine that stated sucherrors are common and often life threatening(Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2001). Sincethat time, considerable effort has been put intoreducing mistakes and improving patient safety.However, even the most conscientious nursewill make a mistake or two. Responding to mis-takes is intimidating, embarrassing, and riskyfor most. Ethical responses to mistakes include: Box 14-5 Research Highlight Aim: The purpose of this safety page from the Food and Drug Administration was to report on findings from the database regarding reasons for medication errors. Methods: Statistics from the FDA database were reviewed and classified according to the Taxonomy of Medication Errors developed by the National Coordinating Council forMedication Errors Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP). Findings: In one month in 2001, 273 medication error reports were received by the FDA. Of these, 129 were serious (life-threatening, fatal, disabling) and 136 were not serious.The most common causes for errors were human factors (42%), labeling problems (20%),and communication problems (19%). Twenty-two percent of errors involved the wrongdrug being given, and 17% involved a wrong dose. Conclusion: Although the authors of this article did not draw any conclusions, but merely summarized data, nurses should be reminded from this summary of drug safety to be sureto check the five rights of medication administration: right dose, right time, right patient,right route, and right medication. By assuring the five rights with each patient interactionin administering medications, most errors can be prevented. Nurses have an ethical andmoral obligation to protect patients by ensuring safe administration of medications. Source: Thomas, M. R., Holquist, C., & Phillips, J. (2001, October 1). Med error reports to FDA show a mixed bag. MedW atch .28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 602 Ethics in Practice 603 Honestly admitting the error occurred in a neutral and objective manner Taking proper steps to correct the situation Apologizing for the mistake Making amends as possible Evaluating how to prevent such mistakes in the future Disclosure of mistakes in an honest and willingmanner reduces the threat of the situation andalso reduces the threat of liability ( Case Study 14-3). Honesty and humility decrease the men-tal anguish of those who make errors in practice(Crigger, 2004). Compassionate and caring rela-tionships with team members create supportsystems in which health care providers can helpeach other weather such storms. Conflict of Interest Conflict of interest situations arise from competing loyalties and opportunities. Thismay include conflicts of values between thenurse's value system and choices made by thepatients, their families, other health care team Jane asks the woman's name and shestates she is Iva Wittacker. Jane realizesthat she has administered medicationsto the wrong resident. 1. What should Jane do immedi- ately in this situation? 2. What could and should have been done to prevent such anerror from occurring? 3. Who is responsible for Jane's mistake? What about accounta-bility of the facility, the CNA,and/or the clinical instructor? 4. What are the ethical and legal implications in this situation? 5. Discuss what might happen if this mistake occurred in thefacility where you are practicing.Jane is a junior-level baccalaureate nursing student who is doing her clini-cal rotation in a long-term care facility.She is assigned to care for a residentwho occupies a double room, 111-2.The resident assigned to Jane is namedIva Wittacker, and Iva's roommate isIda Wallace. Both residents are elderlywomen and have the same initials.While passing out medications, Janeasks the nursing assistant to identifyMs. Wittacker, because the residents donot wear armbands, Ms. Wittacker'spicture is missing from the medicationbook, and Jane has not cared for thisresident, in the past. The CNA points toa white-haired woman in room 111.Jane administers the medications to theresident, and then her roommate entersthe room and asks where her pills are.Case Study 14-328438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 603 604 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues members, the organization, or the insurancecompany. This is particularly evident in dis-cussions related to resource allocation andend-of-life care. Other conflicts occur whenincentive systems or other financial gains cre-ate conflict between professional integrity andself-interest. Nurses should facilitate resolu-tion of conflicts by disclosing potential oractual conflicts of interest or withdraw fromparticipation in care or processes that are caus-ing the conflict (ANA, 2005a). Summary Nurses must respect the worth, dignity, andrights of the elderly and must provide care thatmeets their comprehensive needs across the con-tinuum. Their fundamental commitment to theuniqueness of the patient creates opportunitiesfor participation in planning and directing care.Their vigilance in advocating for dignified, just,and humane care establishes a standard that canbe appreciated, and potentially needed, by all ofus. It is not the rules and regulations that createethical care delivery; it is the little actions doneby each and every nurse in every day of practice. As nurses, each of us is held to the ethical stan- dards of practice of our profession (Esterhuizen,1996). Providing respectful care that puts thepatient's safety and welfare first helps us toavoid situations that can result in failure torescue, abuse of power, exploitation, and over-involvement (Ellis & Hartley, 2004). Devel-oping a framework for ethical decision makingprovides a foundation for discussion when di-lemmas present themselves, smoothing theway for integrity-saving compromise. The nurse'sconscientious effort to follow ethical standardsin daily practices supports the quality of carewe all want to experience. Personal Reflection 1. As you prepare to care for older adults, what values, conflicts, or ethical dilemmas do you anticipate you will face? 2. Assess your feelings about the right to die and assisted suicide. Do you agree with the ANA's stand on this issue? How would you respond in the event that an elderlypatient asks \"please help me die\" when death is not near? 3. An elderly person is becoming unsafe living alone and has been identified as at risk for serious injury. During admission to an alternative living setting, the person appears ori-ented and appropriate. Furthermore, the person expresses disagreement with the rec- ommendations for this admission. How would you respond in this situation?28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 604 Glossary 605 Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Are your patients truly informed about their care? Ask five patients why they are tak- ing the medications they are prescribed, and evaluate their responses. 2. Mrs. Gomez is confused and at times combative. Her family regularly visits and is actively involved in her care. She has been agitated and wandering the unit for thelast several days and has not had a bowel movement for 6 days. She is constantly com-plaining of stomach pain and refuses all oral or rectal medications to facilitate bowelemptying. Her bowel sounds are diminished, and a hard mass suspected to be stoolcan be felt in the descending colon. Will you restrain her and give her an enema toprevent further complications? 3. You see a good friend while you are shopping at the mall. She inquires, \"Hey, is my aunt on your unit? Can you tell me how she is doing? I just haven't had the time toget over and see her.\" How do you respond? 4. You answer the phone and a woman, indicating she is the daughter of your patient, asks you about her status. How will you respond considering confidentiality and pri-vacy issues? 5. You observe a fellow nurse undressing an elderly woman and restraining her hands. The woman has been crying and yelling out for much of the night and is obviouslyconfused. She leaves the woman naked on the stripped bed and walks out of the room,closing the door behind her and commenting as she passes you, \"There, let her wetherself all night, I am done with her.\" What should you do?

Nurses are obligated bythe nature of the profession to act as advocate,liaison, intercessor, and spokesperson for patientsand their families. The profession is bound in therole of the nurse to act ethically and morally, andto be loyal to the patient, to the physician, andto the system, which are sometimes at odds witheach other. Many of the daily decisions in regardsto patient interaction, while simple at first con-sideration, have an ethical component to themthat can be quite complex. Limitations to Application of Theory Chapter 14 presented the definitions and basicapproach used in modern bioethical decisionmaking. With that foundation laid, it seemsthat a practical application approach might beimmediately begun. However, the application of ethical systems and definitions are seldom, if ever, exercised in asterile environment, and when people are involvedthe environment gets messy quickly. Other factorsinevitably impact the theories and definitions ofthe classroom. Although medical professionalshave always dealt with questions of ethical con-tent, the emergence of modern bioethics, mostlyin the last 60 years as technology availability hasdramatically mushroomed, gave rise to increas-ingly tangled ethical situations. This appendixshould demonstrate the pragmatic side of varioustheoretical foundations in making decisions forthe gerontological patient. This appendix willcover contextual frameworks and specific situa-tions with the purpose of providing the opportu-nity to develop some elements of critical thinkingrequired in making ethical decisions in patientcare relationships. It may be suggested that the definitions and systems of ethical thought are perhaps not thebest, or even the first, place for a practitioner ofthe healing arts to begin deliberations. Thatapproach makes the mistake of treating thepatient as primarily a case of statistical proba-bility, and betrays the Achilles heel of modernmedicine, a largely unquestioned presuppositionthat sickness and disease can, and eventuallywill, be \"solved,\" and good can be accomplishedthrough the hope promised by empiricism alone(Hauerwas, 1990). 28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/27/06 10:43 AM Page 609 610 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues Yet this hope, taken to its logical extension, is really a source of despair when we see thatevery patient still dies sooner or later. Death isthe place medical empiricism cannot go. So,approaching physical death as the end of every-thing means death must be defeated or, lackingthat, delayed indefinitely at any cost. Death isthe enemy that cannot be named, the \"awful\"that cannot be countenanced in any fashion, butattacked by any means at hand. The promise ofexpanding capabilities to manage and controlthe extremities of life is ultimately still limitedby the great \"enemy,\" physical death. Such an approach to medical practice tends to depersonalize both the patient and those whoprovide health care. Although lip service may begiven to the contrary, this approach largelyignores the context of the patient's existence\u2014his or her community and meaningful interiorvalues. Most nurses have experienced this deper-sonalization when a colleague, for example, refersto a patient as \"the brain tumor in 308\" or \"thediabetic in 1634.\" It drives doctors to talk topatients and families about percentages of prob-able recovery following a certain course of treat-ment. It is also, in fact, a way to deal with theinevitable boundary of both the medical and thepersonal aspects of human existence and finite-ness. Death is the ultimate boundary experience. Contextual Considerations Each patient encounter requires specific,thoughtful considerations by the nurse. Theseconsiderations can be thought of in contextuallayers to help prioritize the implications. Thecontexts begin with the proper identification ofthe nurse in the patient's experience and extendsto the patient's position in the health care sys-tem, and then to the very personal biopsycho-social individual themselves. The personal contextof the patient will include not only implicationsbrought about by the patient's age and health,but also by family and ethnic background.The Context of the Nurse in EthicalDecision MakingThe nurse first should consider his or her ownrole in a patient interaction. Is the role one ofphysical care provider, agency/system represen-tative, family liaison, or case manager? Intoday's health care environment there may beany number of relationships between the pro-fessional nurse and the patient. So, the very firstcontext that is of critical importance is deter-mining the nurse's formal or professional role.This is not to say that we do not at times func-tion in a realm beyond the formal role in orderto meet patient needs; however, in order tomake judgments about the appropriateness ofdifferent types of interactions, we must firstconsider the circumstance under which thenurse and patient are brought together. Thatcircumstance defines the role, which in turndetermines the direction of the rest of thepatient's experience\u2014and the initial response ofthe nurse often opens or closes the most impor-tant doors. At this initial encounter, the nursecan be faced with decisions that have ethicalimplications. To clarify this with an example from clinical practice, the entrance into a palliative care pro-gram can be used. Strict guidelelines are in placethat dictate which patients qualify for palliativeor hospice care. These guidelines have to dowith life expectancy based on diagnosis or diag-noses. Specific empirical indicators such as labvalues or weight loss are used to qualify or ruleout a patient from eligibility. Many would saythat a somewhat utilitarian philosophical foun-dation was used in determining eligibility to try28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 610 Reflections on the Applications of Ethical Theory 611 to contain costs for Medicare and Medicaid orfor insurance companies that usually pay forsuch services. It seems that with such well-defined boundaries, the hospice nurse only hasto rotely follow the guidelines when assessing anew patient. But the expert nurse may considera combination of factors in order to appropri-ately qualify a patient for service. In this con-textual role, the nurse has the opportunity toexercise expert practice to provide the best ser-vice to the patient. To do less is to bar a patientfrom services that could provide a better qualityof life in the dying experience. It is appropriate to elaborate on the opportu- nity of the nurse to function outside of a definedcontextual role yet within the boundaries of theprofession. One must exercise caution becausefunctioning outside a role can cause ethical andlegal problems in terms of power abuse (restric-tions of autonomy), inappropriate interpersonal(including sexual) relationships (lack of fidelity),or exploitation. In addition, if a nurse is trans-gressing institutional boundaries, he or she maybe vulnerable to legal action. However, there aretimes when the nurse can bridge important gapsby going a step beyond the paid role whileremaining within the boundaries of the profes-sion to provide extra referral, counseling, or edu-cation in order to incorporate a holistic view ofthe patient and to improve the probable out-comes experienced by the patient. For instance,a nurse who is working for an agency providinghome health care with a specific assignment forpulmonary management realizes that other basicissues are not met, such as payment of utilitiesand food supply. Although this person's role isnot as a case manager, he or she may very wellgo outside the defined role to provide informa-tion and referral to obtain these other basic sup-port systems. The Context of the Health CareSystem for Ethical Decision MakingThe next contextual layer to examine involvesthe system. Each system will have a frameworkthat dictates ethical structure. It is important torecognize situations that demand working be-yond a system's limits and bringing the patientinto contact with other systems that can provideneeded services. While considering contexts, it seems op- portune to point out that the philosophicalapproach of insurance companies (whethergovernmental or privately based) is at times inconflict with the natural ethical and profes-sional values of the nurse and the patient'sneeds and desires. Insurance companies mustcontain costs in order to remain fiscally sol-vent. They maximize efficiency. This consid-eration is often secondary to the professionalnurse who is personally motivated by a deon-tological perspective of each patient (that allhuman life has inherent value) and who ismotivated to maximize quality of life. Thedesire to provide the opportunity for healingand to relieve suffering is a real and almosttangible element in the personhood of mostnurses. The principle of justice seems to dic-tate the fair and equal access to health care,but, in reality, this may not exist. In somecases, those with private health insurance mayhave greater access to care than those depen-dent on public systems. However, as surpris-ing as it may seem, sometimes the reverse maybe true: those with public insurance may havebroader services than those with private insur-ance; however, this situation occurs less fre-quently in the elderly because everyone over65 currently has access to Medicare and Med-icaid services.28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 611 612 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues The Context of the PatientThe context of the patient is the central andmost important context to consider. Each indi-vidual has a belief system that includes a worldview of morality and the practical application ofethical decision making. Each patient has a per-sonal view regarding health and illness and thesignificance this plays in their own life experi-ence. The vast majority of Americans express areligious belief that includes a continuation ofthe spiritual aspect of life after physical death.Suffering, although not talked about at lengthin current western society, is an issue of centralimportance in many individuals' religious expe-riences. Each individual has a personal view ofthe value of life in relationship to the quality oflife. Each individual also has a unique relation-ship with his or her family. Assumptions shouldbe avoided and appropriate assessment done foreach patient and family to gain an accurate pic-ture of the place in the family the individualholds. This will dictate how, when, where, andwhy decisions are made about medical inter-ventions, types of care environments chosen, andthe level of involvement desired of the profes-sional nurse. Throughout life we deal with potential and limitation. From the earliest attempts of aninfant to roll over, to the concentrated determi-nation of a child to catch a ball, learn to spell,and read, to the effort of developing professionalskills and relationships as adults, every agestruggles with capacities and boundaries. Inadulthood, people begin to experience a quali-tative difference in this tension. Whereas earlyin life they experienced the expansion of abili-ties and its promise of more to come, in mid-lifethey begin to encounter the stricture of increas-ing personal limitation. In the face of the pres-ent growing gerontological population, it maybe especially apropos to examine this group'ssituation. Consider the following reflection: I have always loved baseball and softball, and keenly enjoyed the challenge and pleasureof playing the game. When I was about 37 or38, I went out to practice with the churchleague softball team and made a puzzling andunpleasant discovery. I ran as hard as I hadalways run, but couldn't generate any speed. Ijumped as I always had, but barely got off theground. I threw as hard as I always threw, butfailed to make the long throws. I had hit oneof the boundaries of life, the waning of biolog-ical strength. My hair began to turn gray. Itbecame harder and harder to maintain fitness.I began to have small bodily ailments, achesand pains that necessitated more frequent visitsto the doctor than before. I no longer show up for church league soft- ball; I can't make the team as a starter anymore,and my ego can't abide being a lowly \"sub.\" SoI have to settle for the realization that a cas-cading narrowing of physical possibilities hasbegun to affect me in ways that, in many aspects,tend to be uncomfortable. My small experience,trivial as it is, is not unique to me\u2014its princi-ple is universal, though individual instance mayvary slightly. The implications of the logicalextension of this progress is to imagine one's owndeath, though it can only be viewed through afilter of distance and denial. In his book, Crisis of Modern Life , Gerkin (1979) notes the process so aptly described inthe previous reflection as a universal humanexperience, and calls it \"anguish.\" In my search for a word that points to this universal and primary boundary experience of28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 612 Reflections on the Applications of Ethical Theory 613 death, the word that seems most apposite . . . isthe word \"anguish.\" In its common usage, ofcourse, anguish refers to acute pain, suffering,or distress. In its Latin rootage, [it] carries aconnotation of a narrowing, strangling experi-ence that has about it a certain angry torment.To experience anguish is to experience thatexcruciating distress of having life's boundariespressed together about the self. One's very life isbeing squeezed out, tightened down. No angrywrenching loose will avail; the strength of lifeis dwindling, and all that remains is thathelpless and angry torment\u2014the anguish ofdeath. (p. 75) He goes on to say: The process of narrowing has begun, inex- orably and unrelentingly moving the life cycle ofthe individual toward old age and death. Insteadof building up, life beings to contract. The con-cept of self must now be adjusted to the narrow-ing realistic possibilities. Eventually withdrawalfrom one activity after another becomes inevitable;life must be simplified. (p. 79)Sooner or later, the aging person has to face the question, \"How do I want to die?\" Thequestion speaks to more than just the mode ofgoing\u2014\"without pain,\" \"suddenly,\" \"withoutcausing trouble to those near and dear to me.\"It speaks to appraisal, an evaluation of one's lifeas it has been lived in the light of ultimatemeaning associated with a person's communityand God, however one conceives Him. ErikErikson called this stage in his developmentaltheory integrity versus despair . In this time of life, a person decides if his or her life has been worththe trip. Such evaluation determines whetherthe person is prepared to or can get prepared todie what some call \"a good death.\"In addition, there is related change that takes place in human development in viewing whatconstitutes a high quality of life. Many youngpeople consider the essence of life to include theirabilities to participate in physical activities\u2014toparticipate in competitive or recreational sports,to enjoy social activities that are active in nature,to travel, or to work in certain professional roles.Because of the developmental stage of youngadulthood, it is not always easy to imagine theperspective of an older person who has lost someof the abilities to participate in an outwardlyactive life, to run a business, to deal with multi-tasking, and so on. But older individuals findintense meaning in their life and report high sat-isfaction despite changes in health, activity level,and functional status. It is appropriate for theyounger individual to keep an open mind aboutwhat makes up the core values of the older per-son's world. Crisis arises out of some change in a person's life situation that transforms his or her relation-ship with others and/or his or her perceptionsabout himself or herself. Such transformationsmay occur in two ways: 1) gradually, the resultof common, universal social or physical experi-ences, or 2) suddenly, brought on by some trau-matic unforeseen event. There is a sense that a person never faces a cri- sis alone. This person is helped or hindered by thesignificant others (including God) of his or herlife and experience who have impacted, taught,and transformed him or her in many differentways\u2014through personal relationships, modeling,or creeds\u2014to see what meaning/purpose theremay be in the universe. The past informs the con-tent of our present and in large part predicts ourfuture. In any case, community and personalexperience shape and develop spiritually a per-ception of ultimate purpose/meaning.28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 613 614 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues As one sees bodily capabilities deteriorate and one's professional options and commonlyheld parental functions disappear, these crisesbetween potential and boundary necessitate awell-developed ethics. Medical crises are a partof, and informed by, the whole context of thepatient's experience and the meaning he or shederives from it. Crises are the places in whichmedical personnel must make the decisions thatconstitute bioethics. The context of the patient and the practical importance of this context are readily demon-strated by the concept of advance directives.Each individual who has accessed health care hashad the opportunity to fill out advance direc-tives and express a preference for life-prolongingmeasures in the face of terminal illness. ManyAmericans, expressing the underlying societalvalue of rugged individualism, state that whenconfronted with a terminal irreversible healthchallenge, they wish to allow nature to take itscourse without the interference of aggressivemedical intervention. This is important becausethe individual has expressed autonomy in out-lining his or her preferences, and the role of thenurse is to act as the patient liaison when con-fronted with circumstances where the advancedirective is called into play. However, because apatient states in an advanced directive that he orshe does not want life-sustaining treatment atthe end of life does notmean not to treat acute illness or to treat with comfort measures.Research has demonstrated that health careworkers in nursing homes have often interpretedthe presence of an advance directive to meanthat the individual does not want to be treatedwith anything, including appropriate access tonutrition and hydration and treatment for sim-ple things such as pain and infection. This super-ficial understanding of advance directives is rifewith more than ethical consequences\u2014it islikely to lead to increased suffering and shortenthe patient's natural life span. If a patient in an assisted living facility, for example, has filled out an advance directive relat-ing specifically that no artificial hydration andnutrition is to be administered if she experiencesa terminal illness that renders her incapable ofexpressing her desire, and that individual expe-riences a urinary tract infection, treatment ofthat acute illness is appropriate. Not treating itwould be unethical. Vulnerable Populations The implication of an individual being classifiedas vulnerable has much to do with that person'sabilities and his or her maintenance of autonomy.Autonomy refers to what makes actions or opin-ions one's own. Autonomy is the ability of per-sons to determine their own direction andoutcomes (Beauchamp & Childress, 2001). Avulnerable person is someone at high risk for lossof autonomy, and who requires protection fromthat loss and all associated repercussions. Thenurse is often the professional person acting onbehalf of the vulnerable individual. Beauchampand Childress discuss the contrasting view ofautonomy to be heteronomy, which refers to con-trol over the person without a moral imperativeas a guide. This situation would exist when aperson acts out of emotion, pain, or fear ratherCritical Thinking Questions: What are your thoughts about the com- ments above? Have you ever been in asituation where a decision made youuncomfortable? How did you dealwith it?28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 614 Reflections on the Applications of Ethical Theory 615 than from reason. The concept of heteronomyadds significant depth to understanding auton-omy. The discussion of autonomy in variouspatient populations is extended due to motiva-tions that one might have originally consideredas autonomous (the desire for more pain med-ication than is physically tolerable, the desire fordeath by starvation, etc.) but are not recatego-rized as actions taken in an altered emotionalstate versus a rational state of mind. All of us at one time or another have been in the category of being vulnerable. As children,we were not able to function autonomously, pro-vide basic needs for ourselves, or make decisionshaving long-term consequences. Most elders areno more vulnerable than any general member ofthe population may be; however, there is a sig-nificant subcategory of elders who are vulnera-ble for varying reasons, including a decline insensory perception, a decline in communicationskills, a decline in mobility, or a decline in cog-nition. Somehow the individual has lost powerand consequently autonomy. When such a sit-uation exists, the nurse is responsible for actingon behalf of the patient with a primary empha-sis on maintaining autonomy of the patient. Anexample of this situation may be for someonewho is in a long-term care facility (assisted liv-ing, a group home, or a nursing home) who doesnot have the ability to communicate due tosome change in brain function such as a strokeor other organic process that affects the verbalcommunication center of the brain. The med-ication aide may have inadequate training onevaluation of pain and wait for the person to ver-bally express pain prior to receiving pain med-ication. However, someone who has a degree ofaphasia may not be able to spontaneously say the\"key\" word(s) yet is expressing the presence ofpain in any number of other ways that go unrec-ognized by the paraprofessional. The residentmay be expressing agitation, confusion, alteredsleep patterns, a change in eating habits, orincreased or decreased movement related topain, and yet be undermedicated for pain. Theresident has chosen a living environment wherehe or she has voluntarily given up autonomy ofself-medication, including pain medication. Theindividual, if acting autonomously, would pre-fer to have medication for pain relief. Yet thisperson cannot access the pain medications orcommunicate with the entry-level person incharge of medication administration. Withhold-ing of pain medication is now considered to bea legal issue. Application of Ethics inDecision Making for Dementia Patients Even more clear-cut examples of the usefulnessof ethical theory are seen in another very vul-nerable group of individuals, those with demen-tia. Because of the changes in cognitive abilitiesof these adults (many of whom have livedresponsible, productive, independent lives),their role in society and in their family haschanged drastically. Individuals with dementiaCritical Thinking Questions: What patients or residents have you cared for who seemed to be vulner-able? What are some ways you haveobserved geriatric nurses uphold aperson's autonomy? Can you thinkof some you woulduphold a person's autonomy who isconsidered \"vulnerable\"?28438_CH14_587_616.qxd 6/7/06 12:15 PM Page 615 616 Chapter 14: Ethical/Legal Principles and Issues are considered by some to be less valuable mem-bers of society. Some believe this is shown in thelack of recognition dementia receives as an ill-ness requiring specialized care in long-term carefacilities or even in palliative care programs.When little resource allocation is given to a con-dition, it can be interpreted to mean that thesituation is not significant. This can be consid-ered a type of prejudice against those who havelost the promise of productive contribution tosociety as far as monetary or societal servicegoes. Custodial care may include the bare min-imum of interventions and environmental struc-ture; however, application of a deontological orKantian view of human existence will supportthe idea that there is an inherent value to humanlife. Many caregivers of those with dementiawho have experiential knowledge of the person-hood of those with dementia will confirm theinherent value of life in those with altered cog-nitive function. Using quality of life and costeffectiveness as the two extreme debate posi-tions, the level and type of care, whether com-munity-based or long-term care, provided forthose with dementia can be argued using vari-ous ethical viewpoints. Patients with dementia not only are depen- dent on others to champion the cause of theirdaily care, but also are dependent on others tomake decisions regarding medical interventions.If surgery is indicated for an acute illness suchas a bowel obstruction, the individual is notcapable of signing informed consent for the pro-cedure. Each state has legal guidelines dis-cussing who is to make these types of decisions.The spouse is the first person considered as thedesignated decision maker. In the event thespouse is unavailable or incapable of makingproxy decisions, the task can be delegated to sib-lings or children, grandchildren, other relatives,or a court-appointed guardian. Participation in research is another area that should be considered in terms of elders. On onehand, it is possible that elders are left out ofresearch because of ageism. But this opinionneeds to balanced with the idea that many el-ders are vulnerable in different ways to variousthreats, whether in regards to physical resilienceor the ability to give informed consent.

Diversity and Holistic Nursing Care Diversity of Elders Adults over 65 years old are much more diversethan any other age group, because of the widerange of their life experiences, lifestyles, andhealth status, and variation in their socioeco-nomic status. Although the majority of elders inthe United States are presently white and female,this is changing. The rise in the number of eldersof color, and differences in diets, leisure, andhealth care beliefs will present a tremendous chal-lenge to nurses. Food is one example of thischallenge. What people eat differs widely: Someelders have tried many different foods through-out their lives, whereas others have limited theirdiets to a few foods, even though great varietymay be readily available. To illustrate, some el-ders have eaten pork their whole lives, others haveavoided it for religious reasons, and still othershave avoided pork products believing they are toohigh in fat. Elders are not alone in these behav-iors. The author recently conducted a diversity exercise with nurses. They were given a list of 20foods from the menus of restaurants within a one-mile radius of their hospital, but only a few hadeaten more than 5 to 10 items on the list. Providing food that is consistent with cul- tural, ethnic, religious, and personal preferencesin hospitals and long-term care settings is atremendous challenge. ElGindy (2004) suggeststhat patients who are in a hospital or nursinghome may need to check out, even against med-ical advice, if the facility is unable to meet theirdietary needs. ElGindy makes the following rec-ommendations for dietary cultural assessments.Remember that each individual is unique, andthat adherence to dietary traditions and guide-lines varies. Personal food habits are more a partof cultural norms, but the nurse can recommendsubtle changes that can have a profound effecton health. For example, switching from regularsoy sauce to a low sodium brand is culturallysensitive but cuts salt intake by half. The nursemay need to use pictures of foods to get a clearidea of what a patient likes to eat. To determinehow flexible the individual may be in makingdietary changes, ask if the patient's special di-etary need is a cultural norm, a personal prefer-ence, or a religious mandate. The wording anurse uses may help. For example, Seventh-DayAdventists believe that eating between meals isan undesirable habit; thus, diabetics can betaught to divide their intake among five or sixsmall meals, rather than told to include a snack.Finally, encouraging patients to perform specialcustoms or religious practices before or aftermeals may increase their likelihood of adheringto treatment related to dietary restrictions. A keystrategy for achieving cultural competence is tolearn about different cultural and religious pref-erences, customs, and restrictions, and then usethis knowledge in planning and providing care. Economic diversity is also great: Some elders are barely getting by whereas others are amongthe wealthiest in society. Ensuring all have ade-quate food, shelter, and health care has alwaysbeen a societal problem. The effects of age alsodiffer. Some 60 year olds who have lived withchronic illness may be frail and disabled, al-though the majority of persons at this age are28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 620 active, productive, and independent. Many 80year olds are frail, yet a few are active, productive,and independent. The key for nurses is to assesseach individual's level of activity and health sta-tus and plan care accordingly, rather than relyingon age alone as a factor in planning care. Another aspect of diversity is religion and faith practices. Again, the elderly are a verydiverse group. Some have practiced only onefaith their entire lives, whereas others may havemade many changes in a lifelong spiritual quest.Faith communities provide a great deal of sup-port for some elderly. Faith communities areactive in promoting health for elders and inovercoming health disparities. Health care for elders is also diverse. Those who are wealthy, well educated, and used to hav-ing power have tremendous advantages, allow-ing them to receive the best care. Those who arepoor, poorly educated, and used to living on themargins of society suffer from health disparities. Health Care Disparities One of the goals of the Healthy People 2010project is to eliminate race- and ethnicity-basedhealth disparities. Poverty for African Americanwomen older than 75 years and living alone re-mains at a rate that is 10 times that of white menbetween the ages of 65 and 74 years (Takamura,2002). The challenge for nurses is to continuedeveloping reliable, evidence-based, culturallycompetent nursing interventions for minorityelders. The differences between healthy agingand aging impeded by the clinical manifesta-tions of chronic illnesses and disability are largelydue to the adoption of health promotion behav-iors and the ability to obtain appropriate med-ications and treatments. Assisting elders to makehealthy decisions and adhere to medication andtreatment regimens is addressed elsewhere inthis text; however, the challenge remains thatwe must adapt our independent nursing inter-ventions to make them appropriate for elders ofdifferent races and ethnic groups. Kathleen Fuller, PhD, the director of AnthroHealth (www.AnthroHealth.net) (2002),recommends reframing the problem of healthdisparities from a racial issue to one of a pheno-type/environmental mismatch that cuts acrosscurrent racial groups. Fuller points out that cul-tural behaviors and biological variations arerarely based on race, and there really are no bio-logical races. Census data from 2000 confirmthis: 7 million people checked more than onebox for race. Focusing on racial disparitiesignores the diversity among racial groups andleads us away from the true issue: the higherincidence of diseases in certain individuals. Oneexample Fuller cites is the high incidence ofhypertension in people of color in the UnitedStates. Fuller points to research suggesting thata significant factor contributing to hypertensionis low serum vitamin D levels. Those who havedarker pigmented skin, regardless of racial back-ground, need more exposure to ultraviolet B(UVB) radiation than those with lighter skinpigment in order to activate vitamin D. Thus,people of color in the United States may needmore exposure to UVB radiation or prophylac-tic doses of vitamin D in order to reduce hyper-tension and the disparity in the incidence ofmyocardial infarctions (MIs) in patients of color.Fuller recommends determining the degree ofpigmentation in all patients using a Minolta508d spectrophotometer, which is noninvasiveand takes about 3 seconds, rather than askingabout racial designation on health care forms.Appropriate treatment would be based on anindividual's skin color, the latitude in which theperson lives, the person's current serum vitaminDiversity and Holistic Nursing 62128438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 621 622 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy D level, and his or her risk for disease. Fulleralso makes convincing arguments for reframingthe health disparities of prostate cancer, low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, infant mortality,rickets, and melanoma as interactions of degreeof skin pigmentation, amount of exposure toUVB radiation, and levels of serum vitamin D. Past and Future of Diversity andAging: Implications for Nursing A 2002 issue of Generations contained an inter- view with E. Percil Stanford and FernandoTorres-Gil, two leaders in the field of aging whohave long focused on diversity. This interview(Kaufman, 2002) contains several points crucialto consider when caring for the diverse popula-tion of older adults. The first is that diversityhas been mainstream for over a decade in thefield of aging, and elders with diverse points ofview have long been in leadership positions inthe American Society on Aging, the Geron-tological Society of America, and the AmericanAssociation of Retired Persons (AARP). Someminority elders who were overlooked now havea well-heard voice. The lesson for nurses here isthat to ensure culturally competent care, elderswho are being cared for need to have a voice intheir care and regularly give input into how careis delivered, for themselves and their loved ones. The second point is the need to use well elders as volunteers and as paid staff when pro-viding care and to ensure that they have educa-tional and training opportunities, as well as thesupport to remain active members of their com-munities and their health care organizationswithin their communities. Virtually all elderswill eventually require some level of assistanceor health care. Helping them stay healthy aslong as possible and then helping them plan fortheir own care is key to the financial survival ofour health care system. We have a long way togo in helping elders make sound health caredecisions early on, before a crisis occurs, and toensure that all family members are in agreementwith the decision. A third point is the need to seek out indi- viduals who are not being served, who are stillmarginalized, and who lack resources, in orderto focus care on those who really need it ( Case Study 15-1 ). Not all elders need all resources; the focus needs to be on those who are in thegreatest need. Providing Care for Those WhoBelieve the Future is Bleak In every new cohort of elders, some proclaimthat \"the world is going to pot.\" The statementreveals both how much our society changes witheach generation and how those who make thiscomment perceive that the changes have wors-ened the quality of our lives rather thanimproving it. Statements may even becomepersonal attacks on those who are younger:\"You are contributing to the problem.\" It isdifficult not to take the attacks personally;younger family or friends who get tired of hear-ing the comments may distance themselvesfrom those who hold these views. Similarly,nursing staff may find themselves staying awayfrom elders who constantly voice criticism.Elders are not alone in their view of change. Inevery generation, some fight to hold on to anolder way of life. Examining why elders feelthis way can assist those who are younger toprovide compassionate care. \"The world is goingto pot\" statement suggests that elders feel a lackof respect for their past way of life, and for theknowledge and wisdom they have gained in six28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 622 Diversity and Holistic Nursing Care 623 to eight decades. Fear and anxiety about beingable to cope with and prosper in the future mayalso be a contributing factor. Listening and con-firming one's respect for the elder's point ofview are two effective nursing interventions.Acknowledging that change is difficult toaccept and keep up with may diminish the neg-ative comments, and assisting an elder to focuson the positive aspects of what he or she seesrather than the negative may also be effective.An 85-year-old woman told the author that sheuses this strategy regularly with those sheknows who see the world as \"going to pot,\" andthe strategy appears to work. If these strategiesare unsuccessful, those who become negativelyfixated on the past may need professional eval-uation for depression.Diversity in the Health Care Team Traditionally, nurses have been primarily whiteand female; however, the diversity of health careteams who care for elders is increasing dramati-cally, especially in race and ethnicity. Thechanges will have a profound impact on eldercare. In order to ensure quality of care, we mustpromote diversity while preventing stereotyp-ing, become culturally competent, cope with andovercome racism , overcome language barriers, and learn effective health promotion strategiesfor those with varying lifestyles. In 1998, theAmerican Nurses Association (ANA) publisheda position statement on Discrimination andRacism in Health Care, which is available at2. How would the nurse begin finding funding sources to helpthose at the clinic? 3. What is the role of drug repre- sentatives and drug companiesin clinics such as these regardingproviding samples of or freemedications? 4. To whom could the nurse go for assistance in addressing theissues in this community? 5. What would the nurse likely see as typical medical problemsamong this group of older adults?A nurse is in charge of an intercity clinic that serves the uninsured, underin-sured, and the \"working poor\" in a loca-tion where the majority of older personsare from minority groups. Getting med-ications prescribed by the clinic's doctorfor those who cannot even afford to putfood on their tables is a constant chal-lenge that the nurse wishes to address.Questions: 1. What resources are available at the local, county, state, and fed-eral levels for such a clinic? Case Study 15-128438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 623 624 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy www.nursingworld.org. Diversity education fornursing staff should be included as a part of rou-tine educational programs within facilities. Toensure that the strategies learned are put intopractice, the offerings need to be embedded inthe care environment where patients and staffinteract (Chevannes, 2002). Grossman and Taylor (1995) have outlined numerous ways for nursing staff to promoteboth morale and quality care when workingwith a diverse staff. They point out that oppor-tunities are created for staff to draw on a widerange of individual strengths. Unfortunately,prejudice, poor teamwork, increased conflict,and a reduction in job satisfaction may alsooccur. Two key issues to keep in mind, especiallywhen working with those who speak English asa second language, is to be sure yes really meansyes, and to recognize and ensure that communi-cation is still occurring when someone uses anonconfrontational communication style. Whenpeople whose English is poor are asked whetherthey understand or whether they will do some-thing, they may say \"yes\" even though theyreally mean \"no,\" because they want to bepolite, or not offend, or not call attention tothemselves. They may use nonconfrontationalcommunication, believing it is better to say yes,and go along, than to be confrontational. Staffworking together can ask each other to repeatwhat is expected or being taught, and ensurethat additional, nonthreatening opportunitiesare made available to raise concerns or objec-tions at a later time. Covert Racism in the HealthCare Team The ANA's statement on discrimination andracism notes that, \"discrimination and racismcontinue to be a part of the fabric and traditionof American society and have adversely affectedminority populations, the health care system ingeneral, and the profession of nursing\" (ANA,1998). Although more covert than in earlierdecades, racism still occurs in health care settings,resulting in health care disparities for minoritypatients and a difficult working environment forminority health care staff ( Box 15-1 ). Adopting policies to prevent racism will diminish theovert expression of racist comments and actionsamong staff, but it does not address the under-lying need to appreciate and increase diversityin the health care team. In the author's view,policies alone will not prevent or overcome rac-ism, and even in those trying to become moreaware, racist attitudes emerge. The journal Minority Nurse regularly ad- dresses the subject of racism among staff. In a Box 15-1 Consider This Minority nurses may feel unaccepted and unappreciated. Minority nurses may feel unrecognized, think that both staff and patients seethem as nursing assistants, and feel thatthey have to do twice as much work toseem as good as their white counter-parts. They may even feel others don'tthink they are there. Repeated exposure to racist comments and prejudicial behavior results in negativeself-esteem and may produce anger andbitterness towards the offender. Source: Grossman & Taylor, 1995.28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 624 Diversity and Holistic Nursing Care 625 recent article, Carol (2005) recommended thatwhen a coworker makes a culturally insensitiveremark and a heated exchange takes place, man-agers need to be informed. Later, when thoseinvolved have cooled down, the situation can bediscussed with the manager present. A sincereapology may be all that is needed, and this mayprevent further insensitive behaviors. If cultur-ally insensitive remarks continue, counselingneeds to occur. Nursing staff working on a diverse team need to regularly explore how to maximize eachother's strengths. One-on-one efforts may be theonly way we can prevent or overcome covertracism and stereotyping and become culturallycompetent. Racist Comments from Patients Little is mentioned in the literature about el-derly patients who make racist comments to-wards staff from different ethnic groups. Somepatients appear to lose their inhibitions as theyage, and those with dementia may be especiallyprone to making racist comments. Redirectingpatients and telling them that the comments areinappropriate may be helpful in modifying thebehavior. One group of personal care aides usedthe strategy of \"giving themselves a time out,\"and coming back later to provide care. Minoritynurses who have \"been there\" also suggest try-ing to understand the patient's intent. Racistremarks may occur because the patient is con-fused, frustrated, feeling vulnerable, and is un-able to think of anything else to say (Carol,2005). Effective strategies for preventing racistcomments have not been tested throughresearch, and the problems are rarely mentionedin the literature, nor are they brought up bystaff. The first step for a staff member who expe-riences a racist comment is to report the com-ment to the nurse manager, who can later dis-cuss the inappropriateness of the commentswith the patient (Carol). Just as effective strate-gies have been identified to reduce residents'behavioral manifestations of dementia includingfighting and resisting taking a bath, strategiescan be developed to extinguish racist comments.Research also needs to examine the long-termeffects on staff of having to put up with racistcomments. A recent article by a nurse in Eng-land advocated that patients who make racistcomments and who do not require emergencycare be denied care (Duffin, 2004). Invisible Groups/UnheardVoices Although we are a diverse society and elders area diverse group, some groups of elders and somegroups who care for elders may be invisible andunheard (Rasin & Kautz, 2005). For example,elders with dementia who are cared for in thecommunity are unable to express their needs.Those who care for them, especially in familycare homes, are also invisible and unheard. Fam-ily care homes are small assisted living facilities,often limited to six beds or less. Even thoughthe quality of personal care may be excellent inthese homes, the invisibility impacts patients'health because nurses may not be involved intheir care, and the patients may have unmet orunrecognized health care needs. Nurses may notlisten to caregivers when the demented eldercomes in for care, and thus changes in the elder'shealth and behavior may not be noticed.Nursing students who have clinical experiencesin community settings may be more likely torecognize the expertise of the caregivers and alsorecognize them as a community resource whenplanning for community care. Nurses need to be28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 625 626 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy educated about family care homes and othercommunity facilities that provide care to dis-abled elders, and ensure quality discharge plan-ning and teaching are implemented prior totransfer back to a family care home or othercommunity facility. Providing Culturally CompetentCare for Culturally DiversePatients Walsh (2004) has developed a plan of care, basedon North American Nursing Diagnosis Associ-ation (NANDA) nursing diagnoses, to provideculturally competent care. The care plan focuseson communication, health maintenance andhealth education, nutrition, and family coping.Strategies are briefly summarized in this sectionand supplemented with additional ideas. If a client speaks a foreign language, or is unable to speak, assess the need for and providean interpreter, and use resources that are printedin the patient and family's dominant language,to ensure that the patient and family will beable to communicate needs and understand in-structions. Use alternative communicationmethods, such as sign language and printed pic-tures of basic needs. Additionally, have one ortwo laminated page sets of common questionsand appropriate responses in both English andthe patient's dominant language that nursingstaff and patients can refer to. Hand-held Eng-lish and foreign language dictionaries that actu-ally speak the words may be helpful. Languageclasses could be a requirement both in nursingschools and in practice settings for all staff.Higginbotham (2003) has written an excellentpaper outlining the ethical and legal recom-mendations in overcoming a language barrier.Health maintenance and health education efforts by staff may be hindered by cultural pat-terns of dominant and minority populations,especially efforts to change dietary habits. Forexample, the practice of encouraging children ofall cultures to \"eat everything on the plate\" cer-tainly has contributed to obesity in Americans.Nursing staff can assess for unhealthy patternsand religious or cultural beliefs that may sup-port unhealthy patterns, then assist patients toadopt new behaviors that are consistent withtheir cultural and religious beliefs. For example,encourage clients to substitute traditional foodsthat may be high in calories and fat for otherfoods that are also traditional but lower in fat.A traditional food of Southern whites and blacksis \"greens,\" which are cooked in bacon grease orpork fat-back. Greens include collard greens,mustard greens, and kale. Substituting a low-salt chicken broth and a few pieces of low-fatmeat will create a similar flavor and signifi-cantly cut the calories, fat, and salt. Greens area great source of both vitamins and antioxidants,and cooked in this manner they are a healthydietary choice. Family coping may be compromised in any health care setting if the family feels a lack of pri-vacy, feels that the staff does not respect their spir-itual beliefs, or feels unwelcome. Nurses can assessthe effects of a patient's illness on the family andencourage families to participate in care. Religiousand cultural requests should be honored wheneverpossible ( Figure 15-1 ). By being sensitive to a family's typical patterns and providing support, aswell as referring the family to appropriate supportservices, the nurse can aid the family in providingcare to the patient while in the hospital or long-term care setting, and in caring for the patient athome after discharge ( Box 15-2 ).28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 626 Diversity and Holistic Nursing Care 627 Providing Spiritually CompetentCare for Spiritually DiversePatients Similar to providing culturally competent careis the issue of providing spiritually competentcare. Certainly spirituality is an important and essential component of culture, but bears specialmention here. Religion and spirituality are com- monly used terms, but should be distinguishedfrom each other. Religion is the organized wor-ship or specific faith to which a person sub-scribes, whereas spirituality is a broader termreferring to one's feelings of being connected Figure 15-1 Nurses should be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among families. Box 15-2 Research Highlight Aim: To study the relationship between older Latinos, their pets, and health. Methods: Twenty-four persons over age 50 (average age of 60 years) and ofLatino background participated in thestudy. Relationships with their pets andhealth, their exercise patterns, anddemographics were examined. Findings: The participants largely felt that their pets were an important socialsupport, much like a family member.The sample rated their health as goodto excellent, despite being a member ofa minority group with more reportedhealth problems than other ethnicgroups. Most subjects had beeninvolved with animals since childhood.Pets seemed to play an important rolein the health ratings of older Latinos. Conclusion: Nurses should recognize that pets may be a significant source ofpositive social support for some olderadults. This study suggests that amongolder Latinos, the family pet, especiallydogs, may be a health-promoting factor. Source: Johnson, R. A., & Meadows, R. L. (2002). Older Latinos, pets, and health.Western Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy with something higher than oneself, often with-out wishing to be called \"religious.\" For many older adults, religious observances and practices are an important part of their livesand family. Schmidt (2004) summarized nursingresearch findings related to spirituality and healthin Spiritual Care and Nursing Practice . Her analy- sis suggested several interesting factors relatedto current research on spirituality and olderadults. First, \"spirituality is related to a sense ofwell-being in older adults\" (p. 308). Many olderadults believe that faith in God, prayer, and trustin a higher power assists them to cope with life'sdifficulties (Easton, Rawl, Zemen, Kwiatkowski,& Burczyk, 1995). Second, a positive exists between emotional well-being andself-transcendence (Schmidt, 2004). In addition,older adults who report regular church atten-dance also reported less depression and betterfeelings of health than those who did not affili-ate with organized religion (Easton & Andrews,1999). Nurses are responsible for finding out needed information about each patient's spir-itual practices and preferences as part of aholistic plan of care. The person and familymembers may be an excellent source of infor-mation. Older persons should always be askedif they wish their spiritual leader or adviser tobe included in the interdisciplinary team ornotified of hospitalization. Local churches,parishes, or synagogues can be helpful inlocating resources and spiritual support forthose with spiritual beliefs different from thenurse's own. Books and Web sites can provideadditional insights, although the older person,if able, will be the most accurate source ofinsight into what is needed to provide compe-tent spiritual care (see Critical Thinking Ex-ercises at the end of this chapter). Spiritualcare takes on particular significance at the endof life and is discussed further in Chapter 22. Taking Lifestyle into AccountWhen Promoting Health A final piece of providing care to diverse groupsis promoting health with lifestyles that are verydiverse. (The topic of health promotion is ad-dressed in detail in other chapters.) Consideringthe diversity of lifestyles is key in planningcare. Some older adults have always exercisedand will continue to do so if they can find a wayto continue despite the effects of aging andchanges due to chronic illness. For example,those who have always been active but nowhave severe arthritis pain or mobility limita-tions may attend a water aerobics class if theclass is reasonably priced, given at a convenienttime, and transportation is provided. Chair aer-obics may be another option. However, motivat-ing someone who has never or only sporadicallyexercised will require intensive efforts, possiblyon a daily basis for many weeks, with continuedmonitoring and motivating for months untilthe change becomes a habit and the elder cansee a real difference in how he or she feels.Patient adherence to medications and diet inorder to prevent or slow down the complica-tions of chronic illnesses is well documented asa major problem. The key is for nursing staff toindividualize the plan of care, then periodicallycheck to be sure the plan is working and makeadjustments as needed. Continued support,either by other elders making the same changeor by health care workers, may be necessaryuntil the changes become established in theelder's routine. 28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 628 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy 629 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy A basic human need of people of all ages is inti-macy with others. Loneliness, loss, and lack ofmeaningful social relationships have beenaddressed in other chapters in this text. Thissection is designed to assist the nurse in enhanc-ing romantic intimacy and sexual function inolder adults. Those over 50 are a very diversegroup, and when it comes to romantic intimacyand sexual expression, they are probably morediverse than any other age group. Romantic intimacy and sexual needs of older adults are often ignored by health care profes-sionals for several reasons. Sex is not seen as apriority by either the patient or the provider,and sexual concerns have not traditionally beenaddressed in health care encounters. As nurses,we do not see the consequences of not address-ing sexual concerns. Sexuality is seen as sepa- rate from health care concerns, rather thanintegral to quality of life. Anxiety and fear ofembarrassment prevent patients and nurses frombringing up sexual concerns. Further, we fearthat we may not have the resources to assistpatients to overcome sexual problems. Most sexual concerns that result from aging or chronic health problems are within the realmof nursing practice. Yet instead of helping, wemay contribute to sexual dysfunction by ignor-ing the underlying health problems that lead tosexual problems. For example, urge or stress in-continence in women may lead to vaginal infec-tions and dyspareunia or painful intercourse; in addition, the woman or her partner may beturned off by the smell. Yet hospital nurses rarelyask about this type of incontinence when apatient is admitted. Acute respiratory infections,abdominal surgery, and mobility limitations fol-lowing surgery may all lead to temporary urge orstress incontinence, but nurses do not routinelywarn patients about this possibility nor treat orrefer those with problems. Sending a patienthome with an indwelling foley catheter will cer-tainly interfere with sexual intercourse. Teachinga woman to tape the catheter up on her abdomenand wear some type of t-shirt to prevent thecatheter from rubbing during intercourse, or towear a crotchless teddy or crotchless panties willkeep the catheter out of the way. A male with afoley catheter can fold the catheter back over anerect penis, and then put on a condom. Par tners report not being able to feel the catheter duringintercourse, and ejaculation will occur unim-peded around the catheter. Both of these tech-niques have been recommended for decades andthey are not thought to increase the chances ofurinary tract infection. Yet again, nurses regu-larly fail to teach clients who are discharged withcatheters these effective and safe techniques. We also miss many opportunities to assist our clients in overcoming problems. Most healthpromotion strategies have the potential for apositive impact on sexual relationships and sex-ual function. Quitting smoking, limiting fat inthe diet, losing weight, and exercise all mayreverse the sexual changes that occur due to ag-ing. If our patients realized that heightenedintimacy and regained sexual function mayresult from these lifestyle changes, they may bemore motivated to make the changes. Romantic Relationships in the Elderly Census data collected in 1998 indicate that thegreat majority of older adults have been married28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 629 630 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy at one point (Huyck, 2001), and like adults ofall ages, many elders continue in romantic rela-tionships. However, elders differ greatly intheir romantic relationships. Some older adultshave been in the same romantic relationship for50 years and have developed a profoundly deeprelationship. Box 15-3 introduces Tim, an 81- old-man, and Teresa, a 79-year-old woman, whodiscussed how they feel about their 50-yearrelationship. Some people become involved in a romantic relationship for the first time after retiring.Some have been married many times, others notat all. Some have had literally hundreds of part-ners over their lifetime, others only a few, oth-ers one, and still others none. Some were nunsand priests or celibate for other reasons, andthen gave up being celibate in order to be in aromantic relationship. Others became nuns orpriests or otherwise became celibate after beingmarried when younger. May-September rela-tionships also occur, and an elder may have apartner who is 30 or even 40 years younger.Some elders have been gay or straight theirwhole lives; others are bisexual and have been ingay or lesbian relationships when younger, thenlater become married and have children. Theopposite is true as well. The 2004 movie DeLovely about Cole Porter realistically portrayed hishomosexual relationships as well as his long-lasting heterosexual marriage. Gender identity may be an issue that a man or woman struggles with all his or her life, and thenacts on the desire to be the opposite gender whenolder. A poignant example is of a man who hadtranssexual surgery at 74 (Docter, 1985). Whenasked why he had not pursued the change earlier,he said that he was married to the love of his lifefor decades, and if she had known that he wantedto be a woman, it would have crushed her. Severalyears after her death, he had the surgery and livedout his last 3 years as a woman. As a society, wecontinually try to come to terms with the diver-sity of romantic relationships. As nurses, remain-ing nonjudgmental will ensure that our careincludes and is respectful of those who are mostimportant to our patients, regardless of whetherwe believe their romantic relationships to be Box 15-3 Tim and Teresa's Reflections on Intimacy Tim\"I think she feels about me just about the same way I feel about her. I'm sure Icome first in her life and I'm sure she'sfirst in my life. It's always been thatway. She was the girl that I wanted. Igot her and I still want her. Both of ustry to please each other. One of the mostimportant things in a marriage is a con-nection. If you do (have a connection),show your relationship in love and withexpressions of love. We say it every day,two or three times. I love you.\" Teresa\"I couldn't live without him. I like to know where he is every minute. I like to touchhim, I like him by me in bed. I like him.I just like him. Tim married for keepsand so did I. We're always together, andmost of the time either holding hands orhe has his arm around me or I have myhand on his knee. And there's not justone\u2014it's not just Teresa, and it's not justTim, it's Teresa and Tim.\" Source: Kautz, 1995, p. 55.28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 630 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy 631 healthy or morally or politically correct. Indeed,excluding the love or loves of a patient's life whenthe person is ill or dying may potentiate compli-cations or hasten death. Including the love mayspeed recovery. We need to ask, \"Who should Icall?\" rather than asking about marital status.Unfortunately, those who are most important toour patients may stay away out of fear or uneasewhen their partner is admitted to a health carefacility. Nurses have a unique opportunity to bewelcoming to those our patients love. Somebelieve that God is love, and it may be that if wehelp our patients to love, we will bring ourpatients and ourselves closer to God. The loss of one's romantic partner through divorce or death is common for older adults;however, the sexual loss is overlooked by mostof society. Research on grieving completelyignores how people who lose a lifelong roman-tic partner adjust to the loss of sex, and what weas health professionals can do to assist them incoping with and overcoming their loss. Ofcourse, not all experience grief, as the last yearsof a long-term relationship may have been sex-less and filled with anger and pain. Neverthe-less, nurses need to assess for the loss of intimacyand sex, acknowledge the losses, and listen toour patients as they express grief and anger. Sexual Development in Older Adults Contrary to what some think, adults whoengage in sexual activities continue to developsexually throughout their lives. Chronic ill-nesses have the potential to affect sexual func-tion, and those who are older who continue tohave sex have to adapt to many changes. Thecurrent cohort of adults who are over 85 yearsold were generally raised not to talk about sex,and may not talk with their partners about theirsexual desires or preferences. They may see thissilence as a way of protecting their partner, eventhough the silence results in loss of intimacy.Those in the old-old age group have lived throughseveral sexual revolutions. The first revolutionwas in the roaring twenties. Women gained theright to vote and gained a great deal of sexualfreedom. The second came shortly after WorldWar II, when Kinsey published Sexuality in the Human Male in 1948 and Sexuality in the Human Female in 1952. The third was in the 1960s and early 70s, with the advent of the birth controlpill and legalization of abortion. A fourth revo-lution occurred with the discovery of HIV andAIDS ( Box 15-4 ) and the resulting promotion of safe sex and the use of condoms. Some mightargue another sexual revolution is occurringnow due to the advent of better treatments forerectile dysfunction and vaginal dryness. Triphasic Human SexualResponse and Changes with Aging Kaplan (1990), building on early work by Mastersand Johnson, identified a triphasic model ofhuman sexual response . The three phases are desire, excitement, and orgasm. The desire phaseincludes the sensations that move one to seeksexual pleasures. Sexual desire is probably stim-ulated by endorphins, and pleasure centers arestimulated by sex, whereas pain inhibits sexualdesire. Love is a powerful stimulus to sexualdesire. The excitement phase primarily occursdue to myotonia, or increased muscle tone andvasodilation of the genital blood vessels. In menthe penis becomes erect. In women the vaginabecomes lubricated, the clitoris and vagina the labia minora28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 631 632 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy extend outward. Sexual excitement is controlledby the sympathetic nervous system, and fear willinhibit sexual excitement. The orgasm phase isa climactic release of the genital vasodilationand myotonia of the excitement phase. Orgasmis an automatic spinal reflex response. Typicallysexual problems can be classified as either desire,excitement, or orgasm phase disorders, or com-binations of the three. Changes in sexual response have for decades been considered normal consequences of aging.Desire may or may not change with aging; lev-els of desire may remain the same throughoutlife. However, both men and women experiencechanges in excitement with age. Achieving anerection may require more direct stimulationand take longer, and the erection may be softer.Ejaculation may not be as forceful, and it maynot occur with every sexual encounter. Vaginallubrication is often decreased, and women findthe need for more direct stimulation. Orgasmsfor women include uterine contractions, andchanges in the uterus may change the way anorgasm feels. Elders differ greatly in their response to these changes. Some couples adapt by increased gen-ital fondling and caressing, taking more time,and paying more attention to each other's needs.Sex may be better than when they were younger.Other couples may welcome an end to sex. Stillothers may transcend the need for sex and actu-ally become closer (Kautz, 1995). If an elderabstains from sex for months to years when in asexless relationship or due to loss of a sexualpartner, desire will eventually decrease. This lossof sexual desire has been thought to be perma-nent; however, there are anecdotal reports thatwhen a person who has not been involved in asexual relationship for many years meets a newpartner, desire will return. When those whohave stopped having sex for many years startBox 15-4 Elders and HIV Older people (over 50) comprise approxi- mately 10% of HIV cases\u2014this hasremained constant even though HIV inother groups is decreasing. Older people with HIV have been ignored by the scientific community. There is an increase in heterosexual trans- mission of HIV in older adults. African American and Hispanic women report higher levels of risk-takingbehaviors. Elders may not reveal risky behaviors that are socially unacceptable, and the con-sequence is that elders are diagnosed ata more advanced state and HIV pro-gresses faster. Decreased immune function due to aging may increase the risk of HIV infection. Drug treatment for HIV is complicated due to changes with aging in drug dis-tribution and decreased absorption. Polypharmacy due to comorbid conditions may increase adverse drug reactions,drug interactions, and poor adherencewith complicated drug schedules. Nursing Role:Identify those at risk and intervene with increased referrals; provide resourcesand educational materials. It is likelyolder adults with multiple older sexualpartners do not believe they are at riskof contracting HIV . We need more qualitative and quantita- tive research on elders and HIV . Advocate for elders to participate in HIV drug clinical trials.

Stillothers may seek help from their health care pro-vider, which has led to what some call the Viagrarevolution. Vaginal Dryness and ErectileDysfunction (ED) The decreased ability for men to achieve andmaintain an erection and the decreased abilityfor women to achieve vaginal lubrication have,for decades, been considered normal consequencesof aging (Ebersole, Hess, & Luggen, 2003). Aswith most changes associated with aging,changes in sexual function may begin as early asage 40, and certainly occur in almost every adultby age 80. \"Sexual dysfunction is common inmen and women and increases with advancingage\" (International Society for Sexual and Impo-tence Research [ISSIR], 2004, p. 19), yet only20%-50% seek treatment, either because ofembarrassment or because they are not botheredby it. Some may not discuss the issue with theirpartners. ED and vaginal dryness are also associated with chronic illnesses that increase in frequencyand severity with age. In a longitudinal study,Feldman, Goldstein, Hatzichristou, Krane, &McKinlay (1994) found significant relationshipsbetween ED and age, diabetes, heart disease,hypertension, untreated gastric ulcers, and arth-ritis, as well as with the use of cardiac drugs andvasodilators. In a later study, Feldman et al.(2000) found correlations between ED and cig-arette smoking, passive exposure to cigarettesmoke, and obesity. The physiologic rationalefor this is that smoking, obesity, and a sedentarylifestyle increase atherosclerosis in genital bloodvessels, while stopping smoking, losing weight,and doing aerobic exercises reverse this process.Vaginal dryness in women is the physiologiccorrelate of ED in men, and thus it is possiblethat these same illnesses and lifestyle habits arecorrelated with vaginal dryness in women. The introduction of sildenafil (Viagra) in 1998, and more recently vardenafil (Levitra) andtadalafil (Cialis), has changed the norms for sex-ual dysfunction. The constant barrage of ads inprint media and junk mail, on television, andthrough Internet sites implies that ED is com-mon, almost expected, and that the norm is toseek treatment. Twenty years ago, ED and vagi-nal dryness may have been a private matter fora couple; however, it is now literally impossiblefor couples to escape these ads. Ads put pressureon men and women to seek treatment who oth-erwise might not have considered treatment ornot thought the problem was important. Inaddition, a woman may not want sex anymore,but she may go along when the man seeks treat-ment because she believes that whether or notthey have sex is the man's decision (Kautz,1995). Traditionally, vaginal dryness has beentreated with lubricants or the oral or cream formof estrogen. Although there are no medicationsthat are direct corollaries of Viagra, Levitra, andCialis for women, women are bombarded withads to relieve vaginal dryness and increase sex-ual desire with hormonal medications and nutri-tional/natural supplements. There are alsoconstant ads for nutritional supplements andnatural remedies for erectile dysfunction. The clinical literature has long recommended that maintaining a healthy lifestyle will lead tomore satisfying sexual relationships. Many rep-utable Web sites, maintained by health careorganizations including the Mayo Clinic andDr. Dean Ornish, and self-help groups such asthe American Diabetes and American HeartAssociations advocate healthy behaviors as a first28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 633 634 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy step in overcoming problems with erections andvaginal dryness. Books such as A Lifetime of Sex (George & Caine, 1998) and Sex over 50 (Block & Bakos, 1999) recommend aerobic exercise, a low-fat diet, and stopping smoking as ways to im-prove sexual performance for both men andwomen. Nurses can focus patient education onthe adoption of healthy behaviors as one step inovercoming sexual dysfunction. All patientsshould be told to see their physician for prob-lems with erectile dysfunction or vaginal dry-ness to ensure there are not other underlyingproblems, and to explore all the treatment op-tions (Lewis, Rosen, Goldstein, & ConsensusPanel of Health Care Clinician Management ofErectile Dysfunction, 2003). An example of adopting healthy behaviors in order to prevent or alleviate sexual dysfunctionis the currently popular South Beach Diet by Agatston (2003). This diet book remained onthe New York Times Best Seller's List for several months in 2004. One of the diet's claims tofame is the loss of belly fat first. Belly fat, espe-cially a waist of over 40 inches in either men orwomen, has been associated with both erectiledysfunction and vaginal dryness, and weightloss, especially loss of belly fat, when combinedwith exercise, is an effective treatment for erec-tile dysfunction in men (Esposito, Giugliano etal., 2004) and vaginal dryness in women (Arcos,2004). Loss of belly fat is recommended in theclinical literature, on reputable Web sites, andin books such as In Bed with the Food Doctor, Eat Your W ay to Better Sex and Better Sleep (Edgson & Marber, 2001), and The Better Sex Diet Book (Fischer, 2002) as a way to increase erectile abil-ity in men and vaginal lubrication in women. Although studies have examined the effec- tiveness of Viagra in improving both erectilefunction and quality of life in men (Hultling,Giuliano, Quirk, et al, 1998), little is knownabout couples' experience with these medica-tions. Who initiates getting a treatment, theman or his partner? Researchers are now begin-ning to study the effectiveness of Viagra inwomen (Basson, McInnes, Smith, Hodgson, &Koppiker, 2002). Dr. Irwin Goldstein, directorof the Institute of Sexual Medicine at BostonUniversity School of Medicine, recently advo-cated that women use Viagra for vaginal dry-ness. Men receive the prescription for Viagra,but it is possible that women may be the onestaking the medication. The same question canbe asked of couples who use lubricants duringintercourse. Do couples use lubricants to helpthe man achieve an erection through stimula-tion or to assist the woman to overcome vagi-nal dryness? What motivates men and womento seek treatment? What are the differences inviews and experiences of men and women? Moststudies of Viagra only study the men taking it,not their partners. One study (Potts, Gavey,Grace, & Vares, 2003) has noted a dearth ofinformation about the perspectives and experi-ences of women whose partners take Viagra, andfound there were several detrimental effects forwomen when their partners take Viagra. Promoting Sexual Function inCommunity-Dwelling Elders Nurses can have a tremendous impact in assist-ing elders who reside in the community andwish to maintain sexual function. These eldersare likely to have a myriad of health problemsand physical limitations due to aging. Thosewho wish to maintain an active sex life will needto learn to overcome and compensate for thechanges. Regardless of the underlying cause(s),three major obstacles to sexual intimacy that28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 634 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy 635 elders will need to overcome are fatigue, pain,and finding comfortable positions for givingand receiving pleasure. These obstacles may oc-cur for either men or women, and for either onepartner or both. The following paragraphs givepractical suggestions the nursing student ornurse can recommend for patients experiencingthese problems.Overcoming Fatigue and PainOvercoming fatigue and pain is key to feelingdesire and to having the stamina to give andreceive pleasure. Fatigue and pain are addressed indetail elsewhere in this text. Common recom-mendations to overcome fatigue for sex are to planfor sex when rested, often in the morning. Kautz(1995) and others have found that elders who con-tinue to have sex tend to have sex in the morning.Another key factor is to plan one's activities tosave some time and energy for pleasure. Pain is a hallmark of aging. Arthritis and other chronic illnesses have a chronic pain com-ponent that lasts until one dies. Most pain man-agement strategies leave some residual pain,which may interfere with sexual desire and sex-ual excitement. The irritability, fatigue, anddepression that may accompany chronic painmay also have an impact on a couple's sexualrelationship. Recommendations include plan-ning for sex at a time when the pain is at itslowest level, often mid-morning for those withrheumatoid arthritis, or when pain medicationshave their peak action. Incorporating massage,a hot bath for chronic arthritic pain, or coldpacks for acute inflammation, or using an elec-tric massager or vibrator may relax sore muscles,relieve stiffened joints, and when done with apartner, stimulate sexual excitement. Womenmay focus the water jets from a hot tub on theirclitoris, and both men and women may use thevibrator for sexual stimulation. Anecdotalreports from those with arthritis suggest thatboth the relaxing effects of these pain reliefstrategies and orgasm actually relieve chronicpain for many hours. This effect is thought to bedue to the endorphin release during the relaxingtreatment and sexual stimulation.Adopting New Positions and LearningNew Techniques for LovemakingBecause of limitations from disease and disabil-ity, some elders need to adopt new positions forlovemaking. Table 15-1 lists resources that give suggestions for comfortable positions as well as Table 15-1 Resources for Information About Comfortable Positions for Intercourse Resource Available fromBeing Close lungline@njc.orgChronic Low Back Pain and How It May Affect Sexuality www.mc.uky.eduSex and Arthritis www.orthop.washington.eduSex after Stroke www.strokeassociation.orgSex and Cancer (several Web articles by the American Cancer Society) www.cancer.orgSex and Diabetes www.netdoctor.co.uk Diabetes and Sex www.tinman.com28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 635 636 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy additional information about sex and intimacywith a specific chronic illness. The illustrationsin Figure 15-2, Figure 15-3, and Figure 15-4 provide examples of positioning for intercoursewhen adapting to chronic illness or disability.Table 15-2 lists several resources where couples can obtain educational materials and productsthrough reputable sex education Web sites. Thefollowing two books have been written for oldercouples with specific chronic illnesses to assistin overcoming the clinical manifestations thatare interfering with intimacy and sexual func-tion are: Silverburg, C., Kaufman, M., & Odette, F. (2003). The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability: For All of Us Who Live withDisabilities, Chronic Pain and Illness . Cleis Press. Corn, L. (2001). The Great American Sex Diet: Where the Only Thing You Nibble onIs Your Partner . New York, NY: William Morrow.Promoting Romantic and SexualRelationships in Long-TermCare Facilities Another issue that is rarely addressed in the lit-erature is intimacy and sex for elders residing inlong-term care facilities. Many barriers exist invirtually all facilities, including lack of privacyand door locks, lack of queen-size beds, andcomplete lack of opportunities for romance.Inability to leave a facility overnight without\"losing the bed\" prevents couples who have hadlong-term relationships from getting away foreven one night. Although it is important forstaff to protect patients from sexual abuse andensure safety, policies and environmental designgo overboard to prevent intimacy. A timelessstory of love in a nursing home, The Notebook by Nicolas Sparks (1999), shows us what is possibleif nursing staff respect the rights and privacy ofthose who have entrusted them with the last yearsof their lives. Many staff may actually promoteromance and sex in long-term care, but they do Figure 15-2 This position may be used for those with limited endurance, COPD, hip replacement, or stroke.28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 636 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy 637 not reveal these efforts for fear of reprisal. TheAmerican Medical Directors Association (AMDA)has developed policies that can be adopted forlong-term care facilities. These policies areavailable on the AMDA Web site, Caring for theAges, at www.amda.com/caring/february2002/sex.htm. Messinger-Rapport, Sandhu, and Hujer(2003) also outline guidelines for sex in thenursing home, taking into account the issues ofwhat to do if the resident is cognitively im-paired, the health needs of the resident, and howto keep the staff informed so that the privacy ofthe couple can be maintained. The authors alsorecommend the video Freedom of Sexual Ex- pression: Dementia and Resident Rights in Long TermCare Facilities , developed by the Hebrew Home for the Aged, a facility that is nationally knownfor its policies promoting intimacy between res-idents. This film and many others on a widerange of topics on aging, including intimacyand sexuality, are available through Terra NovaFilms, www.terranova.org. Evidence-based prac-tice guidelines that balance safety with the life-long need for intimacy are needed. The need tobe touched and held by someone who loves us,and the need to feel loved, not just cared for,does not diminish with age or physical or cog-nitive impairment (Edwards, 2004). Extinguishing SexuallyInappropriate Behavior Unfortunately, nursing staff may sometimes beconfronted with an older adult, either a man ora woman, who displays sexually inappropriatebehavior. Most of the incidents reported involveFigure 15-3 This position may be helpful when the man has hemiplegia; the woman has arthritis in her hips or has had hip or knee replacement; orthe woman has lung disease. Note: If the man has had a hip replacement, he will need a pillow between his knees.28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 637 638 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy men, but women may display these behaviors aswell. Sexually inappropriate behaviors includeinappropriate language (\"Won't you get in thebed with me?\"), inappropriate requests for per-sonal care (\"Make sure and wash my penis reallygood\"), inappropriate gestures (sticking thetongue out and wiggling it at staff), exposingone's self or masturbating in public places, andinappropriate touching (grabbing a breast orbuttock when in close proximity). All of thesebehaviors constitute sexual harassment, and arenot to be tolerated. The behavior may reflect apower issue, a loss of inhibitions due to cogni-tive impairment, or a combination of these. Thebehaviors make it difficult or impossible to carefor the patient exhibiting them. The goal is toextinguish the behavior and maintain the dig-nity of the patient. Nursing staff need to con-front the patient calmly and firmly, saying \"Thisbehavior is inappropriate, interferes with medoing my job, and will not be tolerated.\"Laughing it off, reacting violently, or showinganger all are likely to encourage the behavior.Saying, \"Oh Mr. _____, you wouldn't knowwhat to do even if you could,\" while meantlightheartedly, is both demeaning and mayencourage the patient to try the behavior withsomeone else. Ask other staff if the behavior isa pattern and be sure to inform others so theywill not be caught off guard. One quadriplegicFigure 15-4 Intercourse in a chair (or wheelchair) may be an optionfor those with hip or knee precau-tions or breathing difficulties. Thisposition should not exacerbateconditions such as back or hippain, GERD, or symptoms of hiatal hernia.Table 15-2 Sex Education Web Sites The following are a few professional web sites that are highly recommended by the chapter author forolder people to obtain sex education materials.Reassure older adults these are legitimate sex edu-cation Web sites, and are not \"porno sites.\" www.womenshealth.orgwww.erectile-dysfunction-impotence.orghttp://marriage.about.comwww.sexualhealth.comwww.sexed.comhttp://sexsupport.orgwww.4woman.gov (sexuality and disability for women)28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 638 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy 639 client told the author that he had rubbed thebreasts of every nursing staff member on theunit with his upper arm when they were lean-ing over him to assist in dressing. He had got-ten away with this behavior for weeks becausethe staff had not talked with each other aboutthis behavior. I informed the staff, and two nurs-ing staff firmly and compassionately confrontedhim together, and the behavior ended. Con-fronting him led to several staff talking withhim about his fears of dating and wishing to beseen as attractive, which was the underlyingneed behind this behavior. Although extinguishing sexually inappropri- ate behavior is necessary to care for older adults,there is some \"good news\" about this behavior.It is an indicator of recovery in a client who hasbeen too ill to think or worry about his or hersexuality. It may be an expression of power oranger, both of which are expressions of inde-pendence. Interest in sexuality can aid in therehabilitation process. After confronting a pa-tient, and ensuring that the client is not goingto act out again, the nurse can initiate discus-sions about recovery and how to take an activerole in that process. When working with cognitively impaired clients who act out, confronting them may beeffective in extinguishing the behavior. If thisstrategy does not work, other strategies mayextinguish the behavior. If a client has a habit ofinappropriately touching staff during a bath orbed-to-chair transfer, put a washrag in the client'shand during the bath, or place the patient'shand on the arm rest to assist in the transfer.Approach a client from the weaker side, whichwill both protect the staff member and discour-age the client from acting out. Another strategyis to encourage appropriate behaviors and ignoreinappropriate behaviors. In rehabilitative set-tings, rewarding appropriate behaviors can beincluded as part of a behavioral modificationprogram. If possible, get family involved inextinguishing the behavior. Do not assume thatthe behavior is a premorbid or lifelong behavior,and try not to feed into perceptions of the clientas a \"dirty old man.\" Another strategy is for staffto avoid using language the client may misin-terpret as sexual. Nurses typically say, \"I amyour nurse today,\" or \"I am going to take care ofyou,\" both of which may be misinterpreted asflirting. Instead say, \"I am going to work withyou\" or \"I am going to assist you,\" which soundmuch more business-like. Lesser, Hughes,Jemelka, and Griffith (2005) outline pharmaco-logic therapies that may be necessary when sex-ually inappropriate behaviors continue despitethe interventions outlined above.Dealing with Masturbation in PublicPlaces in Hospitals or Long-Term CareFacilitiesMasturbation is self-limiting and has no knownharmful effects. It does not spread sexually trans-mitted diseases, and can be performed with min-imal cognitive and hand function. Phyllis Dillerwas quoted as saying that another advantage is\"You don't have to get dressed up.\" However,masturbation is only appropriate in private.Public masturbation is best extinguished usingthe strategies described in the previous sectionfor sexually inappropriate behaviors. The goal isto allow for privacy, yet not draw undue atten-tion. If \"privacy\" signs are necessary, keep theminnocuous. Try to provide privacy even if clients'rooms are only semi-private, by giving the clientsome private time. Schover and Jenson (1988),who worked extensively with head injury sur-vivors, noted that some clients benefited from aninflatable doll to have intercourse with. Clients28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 639 640 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy using sex toys or explicit material should do soin private and store them in their own privatespace, away from public view.Patients Displaying Sexually ExplicitMaterials on the Unit or in the HomeDisplay of sexually explicit materials is a prob-lem that is ignored in the nursing literature.Nursing staff may need to set some ground ruleswith patients concerning posters, jokes, maga-zines, or cards on display on the patient's roomwall or on dressers or over-bed tables. Staff needto recognize that although having these materi-als is the patient's choice, openly displayingthem is a form of sexual harassment. A good ruleis that those with a PG-13 rating, such as theSports Illustrated swimsuit issue, are acceptable, but those with naked bodies are not. Rules ap-ply equally to both men and women and applyregardless of the patient's sexual orientation.Rules also apply to staff areas; the inside of a staffmember's locker may be his or her private space,but when the door is open in a public lounge,others having to view the pictures is a form ofsexual harassment. Pictures are not the onlyproblem; get-well cards that overtly encouragesexual relationships with patients and nursingstaff are also inappropriate. If a patient has dis-played these materials, calmly tell the patientwhy they are inappropriate and encourage thepatient or family to remove them. Use respectwhen approaching a patient about offensivematerial. It is their home too, especially if theyare in a long-term care setting. Try a compas-sionate approach first, focusing on your feelings.Keep the confrontation one on one if possible. Occasionally nursing staff who visit patients in their homes may encounter sexually explicitmaterials on display. Tell patients you cannotwork with them in the rooms in which the ma-terials are displayed. Negotiate with the patientto have one room of the house where treatmentcan occur with no explicit materials displayed. This section of the chapter has addressed a wide variety of subject areas related to sexualityand intimacy. The goal is to promote intimacywhen appropriate by assisting older adults toovercome the effects of age and chronic illness.28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 640 Enhancing Sexual Intimacy 641 Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Mr. Song is an older patient of Chinese descent. He wishes to observe a specific diet while in the hospital, but the menus he receives do not include the foods he eats.What is the nurse's best response in this situation? How does the nurse advocate forMr. Song? What are some alternative solutions if the hospital cannot prepare foodthat Mr. Song can eat on his diet? 2. Rabbi Steinberg is an Orthodox Jewish rabbi. He observes strict practices related to his religion, including kosher diet restrictions. If the nurse is unfamiliar with thesetraditions, what information does she need to be able to provide spiritually and cul-turally sensitive care for Rabbi Steinberg? To whom could the nurse look as a resourcefor information? 3. Mrs. Smith is an 89-year-old African American widow who is admitted with com- plaints of severe chest pain. She confides to the nurse that she has no insurance anddoes not know how she will pay for the tests they wish to run to diagnose her prob-lem. What is the nurse's responsibility in this situation? How can he advocate for thispatient and assure that proper medical and nursing care is provided? What resourcesare available to help with these medical costs? Personal Reflection 1. Have you ever cared for an older person from a different culture or ethnic group than your own? How did you feel about that experience? What did you learn? 2. Have you ever cared for an older person from a different religion than your own? How did you feel about that experience? What did you learn? 3. If an older patient was having problems dealing with sexuality after a life- changing event, how could you assist him or her? What is your comfort level withdiscussing sexual information with patients? How could you become more com-fortable with this important aspect of nursing? 4. What resources are available in your area for older persons or those with disabilities who may need additional information and counseling about sexuality after a conditionsuch as stroke or heart attack?28438_CH15_617_644.qxd 6/7/06 12:16 PM Page 641 642 Chapter 15: Appreciating Diversity and Enhancing Intimacy Diversity: Differences between persons, whether ethnic, religious or cultural Dyspareunia: Painful intercourse Erectile Dysfunction (ED): Inability to attain or main- tain an erection sufficient for intercourse Human sexual response: Three phases: excitement, plateau, and orgasm Racism: Discrimination against a person based on race or ethnicityReligion: An organized set of beliefs, ways of worship; often associated with a church, synagogue, parish,or denomination Sexuality: The total experience of being a sexual being; more than sexual intercourse Spirituality: A feeling of connectedness with something higher than oneself, whether it be God, nature, oranother beingGlossary References Agatston, A.

Comparing global aging policiesmay provide greater insights into how to bestmeet the challenges this population growth willcreate. Although much information is publishedabout health care delivery systems in select coun-tries, little is found about their aging policies. International Policies on Aging Japan Aging in Japan is occurring at a rapid pace. In2000, persons age 65 and over comprised 17.1%of the population (Ibe, 2000). It is estimatedthat by 2020, the 65 and older population willcomprise 27% of the total population. In com-parison, the elderly are expected to make up16.6% of the total population in the UnitedStates and just over 24% of the population inItaly in 2020 (Elderly workers, 2001). Cur-rently, the elderly in Japan enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world. Since World War II, policies related to the elderly in Japan have undergone several changes.In 1954, the Pension Reform Act covered about20% of the labor workforce; payments into theprogram were contributed by both the employeeand the employer (Usui & Palley, 1997). Begin-ning in 1961, the National Pension Law pro-vided coverage for the entire population. In the1970s, benefits for the elderly were expanded toinclude free medical care; pension benefits werealso significantly increased (Usui & Palley).However, policies in place encouraged an over-use of acute care hospitals, and during the 1980sJapan experienced a large increase in health careexpenses (Usui & Palley). The Health Care forthe Aged Law of 1982 terminated free medicalcare to the elderly; with this initiative, theelderly had to pay a small deductible for out- patient and hospital care. By 1985, coinsuranceand copayments were also required. In addition to coinsurance and copayments, the 1985 actdiscouraged the use of acute hospitals for long-term care. The law called for an increased use ofintermediate nursing care, rehabilitation, andother lower cost strategies to support dischargedelderly patients (Usui & Palley, 1997). The GoldPlan of 1989 (formally called the Ten-YearStrategy to Promise Health and Welfare for theAged) was a 10-year plan that targeted healthpromotion and welfare for the elderly while try-ing to control future cost escalation. The GoldPlan promoted three services: home help, short-stay institutions, and day services (Usui & Palley).It also included education regarding normalaging to prevent misuse of health resources bypersons acting as they thought elderly personsshould act. For instance, many elderly werebedridden because they believed elderly peoplewere supposed to be bedridden (Usui & Palley).The Gold Plan was modified in 1994 to placeeven more emphasis on community-based care,such as respite care for daycare cen-ters, short-stay nursing homes, and in-home care.Although in-home care appeared to be a solutionto the overuse of hospital facilities, each year100,000 people had to leave their jobs to care forelderly family members (Watts, 2000). In addi-tion, the system was becoming more expensive,and the administrative structure for determiningeligibility was becoming too cumbersome(Ikegami, Yamauchi, & Yamada, 2003). On April 1, 2000, the Nursing Care Insur- ance System was introduced. Under this pro-gram, all those age 65 and older were entitled28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 648 to receive long-term care according to theireligibility levels. The six levels of care weredetermined by physical and mental status; avail-ability of family support was not consideredwhen determining level of care required (Ikegamiet al., 2003). With the allotted benefit, peoplecould choose among agencies providing services.To fund the program, a 0.9% premium onmonthly income was levied on those age 40-64;an average of $23 U.S. was deducted from thepensions of those 65 years and older (Ikegami etal.). People over the age of 64 pay 10% of theirnursing costs and are charged a monthly pre-mium as well. With the emphasis on in-home caregivers for the Japanese elderly, elder abuse has receivedadditional attention. The Japan Federation ofBar Associations submitted a report to the Health,Labor and Welfare Ministry at the end of 2004that included recommendations to assist boththe victims and abusers (Roundup, 2005a). Ac-cording to the report, the elderly were reluctantto report abuse because they felt responsiblewhen their children were the perpetrators, be-cause they raised them (Roundup, 2005a). Thereport also revealed that the nursing care insur-ance program was too complicated for some peo-ple to understand. Consequently, not everyonewas receiving the assistance that could help withcaregiving (Roundup, 2005b). The attorneygroup also discovered that families caring fortheir elderly relatives were experiencing mental,physical, and economic hardships (Roundup,2005a). In addition, current law creates a bar-rier to professionals wanting to report suspectedelder abuse. Although citizens are encouragedto report child abuse and domestic violence,those who report suspected elder abuse could becharged with violating confidentiality (Roundup,2005b). Germany Like other countries, Germany faces a growth inits elderly population. In 1995, those age 60 andolder comprised 21% of the German population;by 2030, 36% of the population will be 60 yearsof age and older (Geraedts, Heller, & Harrington,2000). Aware of the projected need, the Germangovernment integrated long-term care (LTC) coverage into the social security system. The goal of the LTC insurance law was to provide relief from the financial burden of long-term disability and illness (Geraedts et al., 2000).LTC insurance became the fifth component ofthe German social insurance system; other com-ponents are health, accident, pension, and un-employment (Geraedts et al.). Before LTC insurance, 80% of the elderly in nursing homes depended on public assistance,funded by local communities (Geraedts et al.,2000). This situation created a financial strain onthe local communities. In addition, more familymembers were fulfilling the role of informal care-givers. Mental strain, lack of support, and finan-cial hardships created when the caregiver was nolonger employed outside the home made familymembers reluctant to assume caregiving respon-sibilities. To fund the LTC insurance program,one paid holiday was eliminated in all states butSaxony; this equaled 75% of the employers' con-tributions to the plan (Geraedts et al.). Social insurance in Germany is a mandatory transfer system whereby employees and employ-ers make equal contributions for LTC, health,pension, and unemployment. Only employerscontribute to the accident fund (Geraedts et al.,2000). The Federal Employment Agency makescontributions to the insurance funds for thosewho are unemployed. Those on pensions pay50% of their premiums for health and LTC insur-ance; the other 50% is paid by their pensionInternational Policies on Aging 64928438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 649 650 Chapter 16: Global Models of Health Care insurance fund (Geraedts et al.). If family mem-bers of an employee are not employed, they arecovered by the employee's health and LTC insur-ance at no additional cost. Families with onlyone employed member pay the same amount forinsurance as a single person in the same incomebracket (Geraedts et al., 2000). German socialinsurance is based on the \"solidarity principle,\"which states that \"members of society are re-sponsible for providing adequately for another'swell-being through collective action\" (Geraedtset al., p. 378). LTC insurance is mandatory, butthose with higher incomes can purchase privateinsurance. All 82 million German citizens arecovered by social or private LTC insurance(Geraedts et al.). Although most aging Germans are still cared for by relatives, the LTC insurance providedincentives to establish additional home healthcare agencies, short-term institutional care facil-ities, and assisted living facilities (Geraedts et al.,2000). LTC insurance also provides cash to fam-ily caregivers and makes contributions to thepension fund if the caregiver provides more than14 hours of caregiving a week (Geraedts et al.). More research is encouraged to evaluate the quality of care provided under LTC insurance.Costs of the program have remained within thebudget, but adjustments may be required in thefuture as the elderly population increases. U.S. Health Care System and Policies Effects of an Aging Society The elderly population of the United States alsois expected to increase, consistent with the in-crease in the elderly population worldwide. Bythe year 2050, projections indicate that 30% ofthe population will be over the age of 65 years; thepopulation over the age of 85 is expected to dou-ble, and the population under the age of 35 yearswill decline by 10% (Sultz & Young, 2004). Thisincrease in the elderly population is expected tobring challenges to policymakers. The futurepopulation of the elderly is expected to be bet-ter educated, more active, and more culturallydiverse than the current population (Sultz &Young). This increase in the elderly populationwill create economic challenges such as how tofinance long-term care. The shift in the demo-graphic makeup of the population will createdisequilibrium in the ratio between the work-ing middle age population and the traditionallyretired elderly population. Currently, there are3.3 workers for every Social Security beneficiary;by the year 2030, there will be 2.2 workers forevery beneficiary (Triest, 1999). More financialsupport will be needed. In response to theseneeds, creative health care delivery models willbe required. Effects of Mortality With an increase in the aging population, a con-comitant increase in chronic diseases is expected(Flesner, 2004; Sultz & Young, 2004). Interdis-ciplinary teams of health care providers withexpertise in geriatrics will be needed to meet thephysical and psychosocial consequences of theseillnesses (Sultz & Young). Mortality is commonly measured by life expectancy, usually computed at birth and atage 65 years (Williams, 2002). Life expectancyat birth in the United States is 77.1 years, whichplaces it with most other developed nations inthe life expectancy range of 76 to 78 years(Kinsella & Velkoff, 2001). The United States isbehind the countries of Japan and Singapore28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 650 U.S. Health Care System and Policies 651 (the highest at 80 years), and Australia, Canada,Italy, Iceland, Sweden, and Switzerland (79years) (Kinsella & Velkoff). Health practices inchildhood and young adulthood influence thehealth of individuals as they age (Kinsella &Velkoff). As people are living longer, measuresthat support health promotion and illness pre-vention in childhood and through young andmiddle adulthood will produce a healthier olderadult population. An emphasis on preventingsome chronic illnesses or decreasing their debil-itating effects will help to decrease the cost ofhealth care for the elderly. Currently, healthexpenditures by and for the elderly are dispro-portionate to the distribution of the elderly inthe general population (Kinsella & Velkoff). Social Security During the Great Depression, unemploymentaffected nearly 25% of the elderly (Kart & Kinney,2001). Many middle and upper income indi-viduals were affected as estate values and finan-cial resources plummeted. It was during thistime of financial stress that interest in an old-age pension was sparked. With the passing ofthe Social Security Act of 1935, the United States became one of the last industrial nationsto establish a federal old-age pension program.However, the original Social Security Act didnot provide benefits comparable to those pro-vided by other industrial nations. The SocialSecurity Act was strengthened, however, withthe addition of survivors' and dependents' ben-efits (1939), disability insurance (1956), Med-icare (1965), and automatic adjustment ofbenefits for inflation and supplemental income(1972).The Social Security Act provided a safetynet of income in return for a lifetime of employ-ment; it never was intended to provide the solesource of retirement income. It also provided astandard age by which retirement could bedefined (Kart & Kinney). Participation in theSocial Security system is mandatory throughpayroll taxes called \"contributions\" (Kart &Kinney). No means test is required to receivebenefits; rather, it is an earnings-related pro-gram. Benefits are financed by payroll taxes paidby employees and employers on income up to acertain level. Basic benefits, available upon retirement at age 65, are based on a worker's average indexedmonthly earnings in covered employment (Kart& Kinney, 2001). Over half of the Social Secur-ity beneficiaries do not receive the full benefit,however. One reason is related to early retire-ment. Eligible individuals age 62-64 mayreceive reduced Social Security benefits; benefitsare reduced by 1/180 for each month before age65 that an individual begins to collect benefits.Conversely, an eligible worker can increase fullSocial Security benefits through delayed retire- ment credit (DRC) . If a worker postpones re- tirement past age 65 and up to age 70, theworker will receive more than the earned fullbenefit for which he or she was eligible for at age65 (Kart & Kinney). The Social Security Ad-ministration uses a retirement test to determineif a person is actually retired and eligible forSocial Security benefits. Until age 70, benefitsare reduced to those individuals who earn a cer-tain amount of money while \"retired\" (Kart &Kinney). A criticism of the retirement test isthat it is a disincentive to those who continue towork at another job while officially retired. Social Security has decreased poverty rates of the elderly, particularly for female elderly. Halfof the older women in America would live inpoverty without their Social Security income(Meier, 2000). Approximately 75% of the poorelderly are women who largely depend on Social28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 651 652 Chapter 16: Global Models of Health Care Security for the major source of their income;many have no other income source (Meier). Wo-men represent 60% of all Social Security recip-ients at age 65; at age 85, women represent 71%of all Social Security recipients (Meier). Medicare Medicare is Title XVIII of the Social Security Act; it was passed in 1965, after years of tryingto provide some kind of universal health insur-ance. It is an insurance program for those 65 andover who have paid into the Social Security sys-tem, the railroad fund, or are diagnosed withend stage renal disease. Those collecting SocialSecurity Disability Insurance (SSDI) are eligiblefor Medicare after a 24-month waiting period.When Medicare was enacted, nearly one in threeelderly were poor, and about half of America'selderly did not have hospital insurance (De Lew,2000). Medicare is divided into Part A and Part B. Part A is hospital insurance and is the insuranceentitled to those eligible for Social Security. PartB is Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI).Participation in Medicare Part B is not mandatoryand is not funded by the trust fund. Participantspay for Part B out of their Social Security checks.In 2005, Medicare Part B required a $110 de-ductible and a premium of $78.20/month. Thiswas an increase of around $11.60/month from2004; the increase from 2003-2004 was around$10 (Medicare and you, 2005). For reimbursement purposes, Medicare es- tablishes benefit periods. A benefit period con-sists of 90 days of inpatient care. When a patientis admitted to a hospital for inpatient care, thebenefit period begins. In 2005, for each benefitperiod the beneficiary was required to pay adeductible of $912. If a patient is in the hospi-tal for more than 60 days, a further charge of$228/day is incurred. If a patient is in the hos-pital more than 90 days, then the beneficiarybegins to use his or her lifetime reserve of 60days. The cost of using lifetime reserve days is$456/day. All figures are amounts due in 2005;these charges increased from 2004 (Medicareand you, 2005). When Medicare was proposed, private sector insurance plans were used as the models for cov-erage, administration, and payment methods (DeLew, 2000). Initially, Medicare did not coverdental care, routine eye care and glasses, hearingaids, preventive services, prescriptions, or long-term care. With the passing of the MedicarePrescription Drug Improvement and Moderniza-tion Act of 2003, Medicare pays for a portion ofoutpatient medications with the use of a Med-icare Discount Card. From May 2004 to Decem-ber 2005, only the discount card was available;after that time, additional and complex partialreimbursement mechanisms began. Medicarewill also reimburse for some screenings on a reg-ular basis and a physical exam when the benefi-ciary first becomes eligible for Medicare services.Medicare also will reimburse for 100 days in askilled nursing facility to prepare the patient forreturning home, but Medicare does not pay forroutine nursing home care. Patients are requiredto pay a copayment of up to $109.50/day fordays over 20 in the facility, however. Medicarealso covers hospice care for those patients whohave been certified by the physician as having 6months or less to live. Medicare covers care pro-vided by a Medicare certified hospice agency.Medicare also covers home care provided by aMedicare certified agency. All of these serviceshave criteria that must be met for reimburse-ment (Medicare and you, 2005). Medicare Part B pays for physician services, some home care, and some equipment. In addi-28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 652 U.S. Health Care System and Policies 653 tion to the $100/year deductible, beneficiariesare required to pay 20% of the usual and cus-tomary charges. If a physician accepts Medicareassignment, then whatever Medicare pays thephysician, the physician accepts that as reim-bursement. If the physician does not acceptMedicare assignment, then the patient is respon-sible for any additional cost Medicare does notreimburse the physician (Medicare and you,2005). This is a question that all older adultsshould ask of their physicians prior to a visit. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included extensive changes to the Medicare system. Someof the changes included: 1) payments toproviders were reduced; 2) preventive benefitswere expanded; 3) Medicare /H11001Choice, a man- aged care option, and other health plan choiceswith a coordinated open enrollment processwere added; and 4) new home health, skillednursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation, andoutpatient hospital prospective payment guide-lines for Medicare services were included to helpdecrease spending growth (De Lew, 2000). TheBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 re-stored some of the Medicare payments that hadbeen reduced in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.In 2005, the managed care options for Medicarewere changed from Medicare /H11001Choice to Med- icare Advantage. A beneficiary must have bothMedicare Parts A and B to join one of the man-aged care plans (Medicare and you, 2005). Medicaid Medicaid is Title XIX of the Social Security Act. It is an assistance program that is jointly financedby state and federal governments; therefore, cov-erage and eligibility differ from state to state. Toqualify for Medicaid, an individual must fit intoa category of eligibility and meet the financialand resource standards. Medicaid provides threetypes of health protection: 1) health insurance forlow income families and people with disabilities,2) long-term care (LTC) for older Americans andpersons with disabilities, and 3) supplementalcoverage for low-income Medicare beneficiariesfor services not covered by Medicare (e.g., eye-glasses, hearing aids, prescription drugs) as wellas Medicare Part B premiums and Medicare PartsA and B deductibles and copayments (Provost &Hughes, 2000). Federal funding for Medicaid comes from the general revenues; there is no trust fund set upfor Medicaid as there is for Medicare. The stateMedicaid office directly pays the doctor, hospi-tal, nursing home, or other health care provider.Not all physicians will accept Medicaid patientsbecause physicians must accept as payment whatMedicaid reimburses. In some instances, thisreimbursement may be less than the cost to pro-vide the service. The elderly account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid cost. For example, in 1998,although only about 11% of the Medicaid recip-ients were elderly, they accounted for approxi-mately 31% of Medicaid reimbursement (Provost& Hughes, 2000). The fact that Medicaid is theprimary reimbursement mechanism for LTCexplains this phenomenon (Provost & Hughes).In an attempt to decrease high-cost nursinghome care, Medicaid instituted a waiver pro-gram to facilitate home and community-basedcare delivery (Provost & Hughes). Many stateshave instituted programs that support lowincome elderly in their homes to prevent ordelay nursing home placement. In anotherattempt to curtail Medicaid spending, manystates have initiated a managed care model forMedicaid services. Although eligibility for Medicaid is different in each state, each state does require an individual28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 653 654 Chapter 16: Global Models of Health Care and family to use their own resources (spenddown) before they can become eligible to receiveMedicaid reimbursement for LTC. Usually, anunmarried individual is allowed a small amountof personal property (in Indiana, for example,this is $1,500). If the recipient of nursing homecare is married, and the spouse is remaining inthe couple's home, the spouse is allowed to keephalf of the total nonexempt resources jointlyowned when the individual entered the nursinghome. There are upper as well as lower limits tothe amount the spouse can keep. Rules alsocover property given away as a gift so familymembers cannot give away as gifts resourcesthat could be used to pay for care. Long-Term Care Insurance Although it has increased in popularity, long-term care insurance plays a relatively minor rolein financing long-term care (Bodenheimer &Grumbach, 2005). One barrier to long-term careinsurance is the cost. For the elderly, becausethey are a population at high risk to use the ben-efits, the cost is high when compared withincome. Ideally, healthy middle-aged adultswould be buying long-term care insuranceagainst future need, but this is not happening toa large degree. Many employers are now offeringlong-term care insurance as an employee benefit.As a rule, companies offering long-term careinsurance as a benefit do not contribute to offsetthe cost, but they do provide group rates for theiremployees (Sultz & Young, 2004). Long-term care insurance can provide a wide spectrum of benefits; home care, assisted living,and nursing home care are among the careoptions that may be covered. Policies may alsovary according to policy restrictions. Some poli-cies may require a deductible, which is stated interms of nursing home days (e.g., the cost of 90nursing home days could be a deductible). Also,it is not uncommon for policies to provide a fixeddaily fee, rather than the actual cost (e.g., thebenefit may be $90/day whereas the cost per dayis $140/day). When the deductible and fixeddaily fee are considered, even with long-termcare insurance, out-of-pocket expenses could beconsiderable. Also, some policies require a cer-tain amount of disability before benefits will bepaid; for example, a beneficiary may need to havefunctional dependency in three areas before ser-vices would be reimbursed (Bodenheimer &Grumbach, 2005). Therefore, not all who desirelong-term care may qualify for it under theirinsurance coverage. Buyers considering long-term care insurance are cautioned to investigatethe policy coverage in terms of deductible, cov-erage, dependency requirements, preadmissionhospitalization requirements, and lifetime ben-efit ceilings (Bodenheimer & Grumbach). Settings for Care in the United States Acute Care The elderly use acute care hospitals at a rate greater than any other age group. The rate of hos-pitalization for the elderly increased by 23% overthe past 30 years in spite of a decline in hos-pitalizations in the 1980s; hospitalizations forother age groups declined overall (Hall & Owings,2002). From 1990-2000, the discharge rateamong the elderly increased 8% while the ratedecreased by 18% among 15-44 year olds and by16% among 45-64 year olds. The discharge ratefor children 15 and under did not change (Hall &Owings). The elderly comprised 20% of all hos-pital discharges and used one third of the hospi-28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 654 Settings for Care in the United States 655 tal days in 1970. In 2000, the elderly compilednearly 40% of the discharges and used almost halfof the hospital days (Hall & Owings). Overall,average lengths of stay for those 65 and olderwere longer than for any other age group (Hall& Owings; Shi & Singh, 2005). Medicare may reimburse for acute care of the elderly after deductible and copayments aremade. Under the Diagnosis Related Groupings(DRG) system, hospitals have an incentive todischarge a patient as soon as medically possi-ble. The combination of high use and incentivefor discharge as quickly as medically possiblecreates a need for discharge planning and a con-tinuum of services and nurses with expertise ingeriatric physical assessment. Long-Term Care Long-term care \"refers to health, mental health,social, and residential services provided to atemporarily or chronically disabled person overan extended period of time with a goal of en-abling the person to function as independentlyas possible\" (Evashwick, 2002, 236). Mostlong-term care is community institution-ally based.Home CareHome care is part of the continuum of long- term care. It includes skilled nursing care andtherapies, personal care services, homemaker/handyman services, durable medical equipment,high-technology home services, and hospice(Evashwick, 2002). These services may be pro-vided by one agency or by a group of agencies.Home care agencies may be freestanding orfacility based. Freestanding agencies include vis-iting nurses associations, which are voluntary,and not-for-profit organizations governed by aboard of directors. Now sometimes a genericterm for all home care agencies, visiting nursesassociations were originally discrete agencieswith a common history (Evashwick). Public orofficial agencies are government agencies sup-ported by tax dollars and operated by a local,county, or state government. Public agenciesmay provide home care services, but their pri-mary purpose is public health. Proprietary homecare agencies are free-standing for-profit agen-cies. Private agenciesmay be hospital-based, which are an integralpart of the hospital organization; skilled nurs-ing facilities; agencies based in skilled nursingfacilities; or rehabilitation agencies based inrehabilitation hospitals or clinics. Home careagencies are further divided as Medicare certi-fied and non-Medicare certified. Home visits tothe elderly who are eligible for Medicare arereimbursed if certain conditions are met. Box 16-1 highlights Medicare criteria for home care reimbursement. Agency evaluation of the home visit process is achieved through agency outcomes-basedquality improvement projects and through the Box 16-1 Criteria for Medicare Reimbursement of Home Care Visits 1. Care must be provided by a Medicare certified agency. 2. Plan of care is certified by a physician every 60 days. 3. Client is homebound.4. Client requires intermittent skilled nursing care or physical, occupational,or speech therapy.28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 655 656 Chapter 16: Global Models of Health Care Outcomes Assessment and Information Set(OASIS) . OASIS is a standard set of 10 client identification items and 79 items assessingclient health and functional status; the data setis used to identify client needs and assess theeffectiveness of home care interventions (Clark,2003). OASIS information must be obtained atthe beginning and end of service as well as every60 days, coinciding with the certification per-iod. Consumers as well as health care providerscan use the OASIS data to compare agenciesthrough the Medicare Web site at http://www.medicare.gov. Assisted LivingAssisted living is another component of the long-term care continuum. Although there is nocommon definition for assisted living, policiesin many states include the philosophies of resi-dent independence, autonomy, dignity, and pri-vacy (Mollica, 1998). Mollica concluded thatassisted living is evolving as a residential ratherthan institutional model. In an assisted livingenvironment, the resident can determine whichservices are received as well as when and howthese services should be delivered (Chapin &Dobbs-Kepper, 2001). Services generally in-cluded in an assisted living facility are congre-gate meals (although residents can choose to eatsome meals in their rooms to decrease costs), 24-hour monitoring for emergencies, and medica-tion supervision (Sultz & Young, 2004). Ifresidents require intermittent skilled nursingcare for a dressing change, often nursing carewill be provided through a home care agency.Aging in place has been an integral philosophyof assisted living facilities. Key to this philoso-phy is that a facility must adjust its service pro-vision and level of care to meet the residents'changing needs (Chapin & Dobbs-Kepper).Most residents seek assisted living facilities because they need help with activities of dailyliving (ADLs), but they do not require constantcare ( Case Study 16-1 ). Assisted living facili- ties are not substitutes for nursing home care; instead they bridge the care need between liv-ing independently at home and nursing homecare. About 36% of assisted living residentseventually go to a nursing home because theirneeds can no longer be met at the assisted livingfacility. Another 2% go to nursing homes be-cause they can no longer afford their care (Isassisted living, 2001). One concern of assistedliving is its affordability. \"Affordability is crit-ical in trying to make independent, autonomous,and dignified living available for all seniors, nomatter their financial resources\" (Piotrowski,2003, p. 26). Currently, care at an assisted liv-ing facility can exceed $4,000 a month depend-ing on the size of the unit and the servicesrequired (Is assisted living, 2001), although theaverage monthly cost is estimated at $1,800(Sultz & Young). Most costs for assisted livingare paid for out of pocket, but long-term careinsurance, Social Security Supplemental Income,and, in 37 states, Medicaid may assist with thecost (Sultz & Young). Facilities may charge feesfor additional services such as meal choices andadditional personal care (Is assisted living, 2001).Long-Term Care Facility (Nursing Home)According to Nursing Home Info (2003), anursing home \"provides skilled nursing care andrehabilitation services to people with illnesses,injuries, or functional disabilities.\" Nursinghomes may provide both skilled nursing andintermediate care. Those with skilled nursingfacilities (SNF) can provide nursing care to indi-viduals who require a higher level of care for a28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 656 Settings for Care in the United States 657 short amount of time. Skilled nursing unitsoften bridge the care needs between hospital andhome care. When patients are medically stable,have used hospital days allotted to them underthe prospective payment system (PPS) , and yet are not ready to be cared for at home,Medicare will reimburse for skilled nursing carein a Medicare certified agency for 100 days eachbenefit period. After 20 days in a skilled nurs-ing facility, the beneficiary must pay a copay-ment of up to $109.50/day (Medicare and you,2005). A benefit period begins the day ofadmission to an SNF and ends when skillednursing care has not been received for 60 days ina row (Medicare.gov, 2005). Individuals who require constant nursing care for stable, chronic conditions are not eligi-ble for Medicare reimbursement. For thesepatients, care in a nursing home as part of thecontinuum of long-term care is an option. Eachstate defines what constitutes a nursing home;no federal guidelines define a nursing home.Nursing homes may be owned by private, for-profit organizations; or governmententities (Medicare.gov, who desire to provide beds for residentswho qualify for Medicaid must be Medicaid cer-tified, indicating that they have met definedstandards of care and services. Nursing homesmay have beds certified as Medicaid, Medicare(SNF), or private pay (Medicare.gov, 2005). Two major concerns face nursing homes to- day. One is the overall quality of care, and theaspirin; she was also getting a little for-getful. Upon discharge, Anna will be onCoumadin for at least 2 weeks, so shewill need a protime and INR drawnweekly to determine dosage. She willresume her atenolol, but not the babyaspirin. 1. What are Anna's options for care after discharge? 2. What assessments should the nurse make to help determine an appropriate postdischargereferral? 3. What decision should be made about postdischarge care?Anna Broom is a 76-year-old widow who recently had bilateral knee replace-ments. She is completing her inpatientrehabilitation, and the nurses areexploring with her the need for referralto postdischarge care. Anna's husbandof 52 years died 2 years ago from renalfailure subsequent to sepsis, and shelived alone in a tri-level home beforeher surgery. Two of her children live inthe same city. Both work, and they areconcerned about their mother's safetyupon discharge because she must go up8 stairs to get to the bedroom and bath-room in her own home. Before surgery,Anna was taking atenolol and a baby Case Study 16-128438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 657 658 Chapter 16: Global Models of Health Care second is the decline in Medicaid reimburse-ment. As the cost of care increases and Medicaidreimbursement remains flat, in effect, reim-bursement has declined because the percentageof actual cost covered by the reimbursement isless. Hicks, Rantz, Petroski, and Mukamel(2004) investigated the relationship betweenvariable nursing home costs and outcome of caremeasures. Outcome measures used were 1) de-cline in ADLs, 2) development of pressure ul-cers, 3) weight loss, and 4) psychotropic druguse. Results indicated that, collectively, thesequality outcome measures can substantiallyimpact the cost of nursing home of care. Thebalance of cost and quality can place nursinghomes in a precarious position because they areunder constant pressure to improve performanceand keep costs down (Scott, Vojir, Jones, &Moore, 2005). Nursing homes must compiledata on resident health and outcomes on a reg-ular basis; data are collected in a MinimumData Set (MDS) . These data are used to com- pare performances of nursing homes nationwide.The Medicare Nursing Home Report Card com-paring nursing homes is available on theMedicare Web site at http://www.medicare.gov. Maas (2004) proposed the need for a new par- adigm for long-term care. According to Maas,in today's nursing home environment, medicalcare is assumed most important, with theaccompanying custodial care considered satis-factory. She posited a new paradigm that wouldabandon the medical-custodial model in favor ofone that emphasized holistic, interdisciplinarycare with multiple strategies to meet the needsof the older adult. In this paradigm, the roles ofgeriatric nurses and geriatric best practiceswould be emphasized. Maas also proposed ex-tending Medicare and Medicaid reimbursementto advance practice nurses and nurses with spe-cific gerontological training for nurse case man-agement and interventions. Personal Reflection 1. Access the Medicare Web site at www.medicare.gov and access the home health agency comparison data. Explain how the care you provided an elderly client and fam-ily through a home care agency is reflected in these comparison data. 2. Visit an assisted living facility and a nursing home in your area. What was your impression of the two settings for care? 3. Interview someone who has come from another country. Explore with this person how the elderly were cared for in his or her country. Would that health policy be a viablemodel for the United States? 28438_CH16_645_664.qxd 6/7/06 12:17 PM Page 658 Settings for Care in the United States 659 Box 16-2 Research Highlight Aim: The purpose of this study was threefold: 1) describe the characteristics of hospitalized older adults who were not referred for home care; 2) compare the referral decisions of hos-pital clinicians with those of nurses with expertise in discharge planning and transitionalcare; and 3) compare the characteristics of hospitalized older adults who did not receive ahome care referral with those of patients who did receive a home care referral. Methods: The sample for this secondary analysis consisted of patients 65 years of age and older; 75 received home care after hospital discharge and 99 did not. A descriptive casestudy design was employed. Measures of sociodemographic data, self-rated health status,functional status, and depression were available in the original data. No additional datawere collected. Original research records were reviewed to identify characteristics associ-ated with the need for home care, likelihood of postdischarge referral, or the developmentof poor discharge outcomes. Expert nurses in transitional care and discharge planningreviewed each patient profile and determined the need for postdischarge referral. Datawere analyzed using descriptive statistics, content analysis, Chi-square, and t-tests. Conclusion: The expert nurses disagreed with the hospital clinicians regarding referral decisions on 97% of the cases. Patients who received home care referral were older, hadlonger hospitalizations, more often rated their health as fair or poor, and had worse func-tional status than those not referred to home care. Many of those who were not referred tohome care demonstrated characteristics associated with the need for home care referral,with the likelihood of receiving a referral, or with developing poor postdischarge out-comes. Findings suggest the need to assist hospital clinicians to identify patients whowould benefit from home care referral. Source: Bowles, K. H., Naylor, M. D., & Foust, J. B. (2002).

Distinguish between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams.2. Describe the roles and educational background of each team member.3. Discuss the challenges and benefits of interdisciplinary geriatric teams.4. Appreciate the unique contributions that the interdisciplinary geriatric team can make towards helping older adults achieve their maximal levels ofindependence. KEY TERMS Acute care for elders (ACE) Geriatric assessment interdisciplinary team (GAIT) Geriatric assessment team (GAT) Geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) Chapter 17: The Interdisciplinary Team The elderly deal with normal age changes, theimpact of chronic illness, and the realities of realor potential changes in function or cognition.Their needs for health care are best served througha comprehensive collaborative approach to as-sessment and care (Reuben et al., 2004). This ismost frequently referred to as an interdisciplin-ary team. The concept of interdisciplinary teams has been discussed in the health care literature sinceearly in the twentieth century. The underlying\"assumption [is] that an interdisciplinary teamwill bring together diverse skills and expertiseto provide more effective, better coordinated,[and] better quality services for clients\" (Ducanis& Golin, 1979, p. 1). In gerontology, interest incollaboration has been enhanced through formalefforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs(Reuben et al., 2004) and grants that supportedthe development of geriatric assessment centersand (Siegler, Hyer, Fulmer, & Mezey, 1998). This chapter begins with an overview of the concept of teams. A discussion of geriatric teamsand their potential members along with educa-tional efforts to prepare health professionals forcollaborative roles is presented. The chapterconcludes with a discussion of common chal-lenges and benefits found in the geriatric teamexperience. Teams There is no one consistent definition of team in health care. The idea of teams conjures up sportsanalogies as one thinks of groups of individualswith various skills and roles working togetherfor a common end: winning a game. A batteralone does not win a baseball game nor does alinebacker win a football game. Instead, all theteam's players bring different perspectives andskills and work together to complement or buildon one another's efforts to achieve the commongoal of winning. This analogy fits well whenone considers a variety of health professionals,each with different perspectives, knowledge,and skills, all wanting to provide effective carefor the same individual. Where the analogy failsis the lack of a common vision of what the pro-cess and end products are and how professionalscan effectively work together. Various disciplineshave different views of teams and teamwork.Some may see teams as collaborative and egali-tarian whereas others see teams as groups ofindividuals having a top-down perspective withone person in charge. With no common lan-guage among health professionals nor expecta-tion of interdependence, teams continue to be awork in progress. Early literature related to teams is found in psychiatric and rehabilitation areas (Ducanis &Golin, 1979). In both of these specialties a num- ber of different disciplines work in the same set-tings with the same patients. Efforts to cometogether in assessing needs and developing treat-ment plans became part of their practice due tothis proximity along with an appreciation of orfrustration with each other's roles. Over the past50 years, discussions of teams and team ap-proaches have evolved, working to define theroles and responsibilities of different team efforts. Teams have been defined in terms of why they exist; for example, they may be client cen-tered or task centered (Ducanis & Golan, 1979).They also are defined in terms of how the teamis seen to function for example as multidiscipli-nary or interdisciplinary. Multidisciplinary teams function as a group (multiple) of professionalswho work loosely in the same area or with thesame client. Interdisciplinary teams are an28438_CH17_665_682.qxd 6/7/06 11:49 AM Page 670 Teams 671 interconnected group of professionals who havecommon and collective goals. Another way todescribe multidisciplinary and interdisciplinaryis to see multidisciplinary as sequential, witheach discipline applying their assessment andintervention within their own silo (Siegler et al.,1998), whereas interdisciplinary teams have aninteractive approach to care. Today the termsmultidisciplinary and interdisciplinary are often used interchangeably, which further confusesthe issue. Interdisciplinary teams include members from different disciplines who together under-take specified activities as a group with the cli-ent. Although each of the health professionalsbrings his or her own expertise (Greiner &Knebel, 2003), collectively they assume the basicroles of sharing information and coordinatingcare to provide a coherent and cohesive service tothe client. On a more advanced level, the mem-bers of an interdisciplinary team tackle complexproblem solving, are interdependent in theirwork, and as one share accountability for out-comes. Rowe notes, \"an interdisciplinary ap-proach recognizes that many clinical problemsoutstrip the tools of individual disciplines andentails several health care providers simultane-ously and cooperatively evaluating the patientand developing a joint plan of action\" (1998, p. vii). In the most effective teams the client(and/or caregiver) is an active team member andis expected to participate in goal setting and careplanning. Most would say the client is alwayspart of an interdisciplinary team or it is not atrue team. Interdisciplinary teamwork is anevolving process requiring communication andnegotiation in a mutually respectful environ-ment by all involved (Lindeke & Sieckert, 2005). In geriatrics, teams are seen in all aspects of care, but the most common areas are in geriatricassessment and geriatric treatment. The needsfor a team are based on the complex issues pre-sented by the elderly; the benefits include coor-dination and integration of care assessment andplanning (Howe, Sherman, Amato, & Banc,2002; Cowan, 2005). interdisciplinary approachprovides more holistic and comprehensive care. Table 17-1 provides a summary of the com- mon disciplines involved in geriatric teams.Adapted from a geriatrics interdisciplinary cur-riculum (Howe et al., 2002), this table sharesprofessional titles, a description of education,and roles/skills important to the elderly, and alsoincludes links to the professional organizationsand/or specific gerontology resources for the pro-fession. The most common reason for the mem-ber to be on the team is the unique body ofknowledge they bring to the assessment or treat-ment aspect of the services offered ( Box 17-1 ). As can be seen in Table 17-1, the \"who\" in a team can include any of a number of health careprofessionals along with the client and family orcaregiver. If, instead of a series of appointments,a geriatric team provided assessments, this mightbe accomplished in a consultative assessment visitwith the team ( Case Study 17-1 ). The deciding factor for team membership is the aim of theassessment or treatment. Beyond the client, teamsmay include any combination of geriatricians, reg-istered nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians,physician assistants, social workers, psychologists,psychiatrists, pharmacists, occupational thera-pists, physical therapists, speech pathologists, andchaplains (Agostini, Baker, Inouye, & Bogardus,2001; Hartford Foundation, 2001; Howe et al.,2002; Siegler, et al., 1998). Going beyond the tra-ditional health care team seen in inpatient andoutpatient settings, teams may also be formed byincluding others outside of health care that are28438_CH17_665_682.qxd 6/7/06 11:49 AM Page 671 672 Chapter 17: The Interdisciplinary TeamTable 17-1 Disciplines, Education, Roles, and Web Resources in Gerontology Education/Certification Role in Web Discipline andrequirements of institutionLife medical physician withfellowship (2 years) in gerontology,postmedical internship, andresidency board certification Assesses hearing including audio-metric studies, evoked potentials,and other diagnostic proceduresand treatment of hearing loss.Varying degrees of expertiseProvide support to theclient/patient, family, and othersas it relates to spiritual needs.

Together they could assess Mr. J. for diabetes control andthe presence of peripheral neuropathy, which may be affecting his mobility and rule out a minorstroke given his history of hypertension and diabetes. From that point they could assess hisneed for physical or occupational therapy for functional mobility. The dietician could analyzehis diet and, based on Mr. J.'s diabetes, recommend dietary needs. Depending on the assess-ment for grieving or depression, recommendations for counseling, medication, or socializationmight be needed. Referrals could be made as needed for Meals on Wheels or for some social-ization activities at a senior center. nurse or nurse practitioner, thepharmacist, the dietician, thephysical therapist, or the occu-pational therapist? 2. Should the physician be an internist, an endocrinologist, apsychiatrist, or a gerontologist? 3. Should Mr. J. see all of these individuals and have multipleevaluations, treatment plans,and follow-up appointments? 4. Which professional should he see first? 5. Is it possible for the different treatment plans to be duplicativeor counterproductive to eachother?Mr. J., an 84-year-old man, has Type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Anexample would be a team focused on elder abuseassessment, which may include collaborationwith adult protective services (Dyer et al., 1999). Together the geriatric team can identify needs based on a wide array of assessmentparameters. Working together allows thepatient to be seen as a whole. Team Development Unfortunately, none of the individual profes-sions requires educational coursework or consis-tent experience in interdisciplinary work. Thevalue of health professionals learning to work ininterdisciplinary teams is not limited to geron-tology and has become an area of concern andneed for all health professionals. In their Crossing the Quality Chasm report (2001), the Institute of Medicine (IoM) notes that \"effective teams havea culture that fosters openness, collaboration,teamwork, and learning from mistakes\" (p.132). The IoM expanded this to a mandate forinterdisciplinary education in its publication,Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality(Greiner & Knebel, 2003). It notes the need towork in interdisciplinary teams for patientsafety and quality care. To do this, profession-als need to learn to cooperate, collaborate, com-municate, and integrate care in teams to ensurethat care is continuous and reliable. Developingcore competencies of providing patient-centeredcare based on current evidence, quality improve-ment strategies, and informatics through workin interdisciplinary teams is key to effective care(p. 46). In 1994, the John A. Hartford Foundation began its efforts for geriatric interdisciplinaryteam training (GITT) by establishing an advi-sory committee to consider the feasibility for atraining program (Hyer, 1998). From that advi-sory committee a plan was implemented thatoffered grants to initiate training programs.That initial group of grant programs includedstudents from advanced practice nursing, med-icine, occupational therapy, physical therapy,ethics, law, social work, audiology, dentistry, nu-trition and dietetics, pharmacy, administration,psychology, pastoral counseling, physician assis-tants, and speech and language pathology. Thetarget was to expose these health professionalsto group interaction, group norms, and growthduring their educational process. This initialproject has gone beyond the initial education ofthe participants to the development of a corecurriculum in interdisciplinary training (JohnA. Hartford Foundation, 2001b). Box 17-2 pro- vides online resources for GITT along withother Web resources. Another team education model is the geriatric assessment interdisciplinary team (GAIT) , funded in Maryland as part of the Geriatric andGerontology Education and Research Program(GGEAR). This is an elective for students fromMaryland schools of medicine, gerontology, psy-chology, recreation therapy, social work, nursing,physician assistants, speech and language, dental,law, pharmacy, and occupational and physicaltherapy that includes a series of 2-day rotationsbetween various geriatric programs. The compo-nents of the training include a core curriculum aswell as experience in working in a team environ-ment. Content related to the professional roles ofthe various team members, their education, andscope of practice is foundational to working to-gether. The content includes meanings and defi-nitions found in geriatrics. Additional materialdeals with team-building exercises and rolesplayed within a team, which may or may notreflect the individual's professional role. Finally,28438_CH17_665_682.qxd the team's forming, storming, norming, and per-forming phases are shared as a means of under-standing the dynamic of a team's developmentalprocess (Siegler et al., 1998). Teams in geriatrics are usually focused on assessment, consultation, or management. Ger- iatric assessment teams (GATs) or geriatric consultation teams vary with the purpose of theconsultation and may occur in an inpatient oroutpatient setting. For example, if the teamfocuses on dementia or Alzheimer's assessmentthere may be members who can evaluate othercauses of confusion, ascertain cognitive function,or identify stages of the disease process and thepotential resources available to the individual. Ifthe team is focused on functional assessment, theemphasis may be on activities of daily living,home assessment, and the etiology of the func-tional changes. Geriatric teams are frequentlycalled in to evaluate \"functional, social, fall medication, depression, cognition, andincontinence\" problems (Dellasega, Salerno, Lacko,& a metaanalysis of multidisciplinary geriatric consultation, Agostini, Baker, Inouye, & Bogardus(2001) noted that fewer than half of all hospitalsoffer comprehensive geriatric assessment. Theseconsultation teams provide services throughoutthe hospital to the attending physician. Unfortun-ately, these services are requested for only a smallnumber of the hospitalized elderly. The recom-mendation from the analysis is that further studyis needed to identify the potential effect of geri-atric consultation, especially in the area of func-tional loss due to hospitalization. There are also treatment and management teams, which may occur in the inpatient oroutpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, ifthere are designated units, these are often re-ferred to as inpatient geriatric evaluation andBox 17-2 The American Geriatric Society GITT site http://www.americangeriatrics.org/education/gitt/gitt.shtml The John A Hartford GITT home page http://www.gitt.org The National Council on the Aging http://www.ncoa.org Discover Nursing Links http://www.discovernursing.com/jnj-specialtyID_238-dsc-specialty_detail.aspx Interdisciplinary Care of 6/7/06 11:49 AM Page 678 Challenges and Benefits 679 management (GEM) units. Another term used is acute care for elders (ACE) units. In GEM and ACE units, patients are admitted to thegeriatric service and the unit is staffed withgeriatric team members. Studies to date havenot provided statistical differences in outcomes,although the literature is limited. Agostini,Baker, & Bogardus (2001) do note there wereindications of increased likelihood of dischargehome in the studies reviewed. Challenges and Benefits The challenges begin with the reality that eachprofessional discipline has been educated tothink in a specific way. That socialization rarelyincludes the expectation to work within aninterdisciplinary team. The move into a teamrole means a blur in roles and in some long-heldnorms. Only nursing and social work are notedto have a history of collaboration (Reuben et al.,2004). Most of the professionals are used tobeing dependent on physician orders. This expe-rience, as well as the physician's experience ofwriting orders, may impact the manner inwhich a team initially works together. The lackof understanding about each other's professionaleducation, roles, and scope of practice can leadto unrealistic or limited expectations. All theseissues need to be part of the initial work as ateam comes together. Although there have been training programs as well as curricula, the initial work has beendone with students working in teams. Imple-menting geriatric teams in the work settingrequires an investment in time to develop ateam and work through a team building effort.It is likely that professionals have not had expe-rience or training in working in an interdisci-plinary team. The bottom line is also an issue.There is no real funding or reimbursement forteam development. This requires institutionalas well as professional commitment (Reuben etal., 2003). There may even be regulatory and accredi- tation barriers that do not recognize teamstructures. Administrators or the team itselfmay continue to look at the silo approach tocare. Reimbursement is another issue. Not alldisciplines can bill for services, but these dis-ciplines may be key to providing a compre-hensive assessment. Finally there is the issue of shared power. This is an issue within the team because as mentionedearlier, professional norms indicate who writesorders and who follows them. This is also an issuewhen power is shared with the patient. In aninterdisciplinary team, the patient or caregiver isan equal member of the team and is expected toparticipate in the goal setting and planning fortheir own care. The role of the patient as expertis not one common in this country and may causedissonance for some professionals. The benefits of geriatric teams center around the potential benefit for the elderly as theyreceive patient-centered assessment and inter-ventions that take the whole person, the contextin which they find themselves, and their pre-senting concerns into consideration. Because theprofessionals on a geriatric team have advancedknowledge of aging, chronic illness, and diseaseas well as functional loss prevention, the elderlyreceive a comprehensive approach to their care.Satisfaction is increased through the inclusionof the patient or caregiver in the assessment aswell as the planning and goal setting. Care isviewed as more respectful when the patient'svalues, impressions, and preferences are in-cluded in the process (Greiner & Knebel, 2003).The quality of care is increased by the inclusion28438_CH17_665_682.qxd 6/7/06 11:49 AM Page 679 680 Chapter 17: The Interdisciplinary Team of evidence from a number of different profes-sional perspectives as part of the assessment andtreatment process. In general, it is more costeffective to provide care using a geriatric teambecause there is less redundancy in the servicesprovided and the team has representatives thatview the presenting issues from a multitude ofperspectives at the same time (Vazarini et al.,2005). From a professional standpoint, the benefits include shared values, goals, and responsibilitiesfor the care of the elderly. The opportunity towork together and learn from one another hasthe potential to allow team members to grow.Another advantage to working in teams is thedevelopment of new skills in communication,conflict resolution, cooperation, and time man-agement as one gains comfort working withina team. The potential for time saving and increased productivity are also part of a team effort. Thetime saving relates not only to the patient, butalso to the professional who does not need towait for consultations, avoids duplication of as-sessment information, and maintains an under-standing of what resources are available withinthe team. An increase in productivity occursthrough team meetings, versus individual con-tacts, with all involved in the assessment ortreatment of a patient. In general, once the investment is made in the team concept, there is great opportunity forprofessional growth. The potential for collabo-ration in planning, decision making, problemsolving, and goal setting has great promise inhealth care (Gardner, 2005; Greiner & Knebel,2003). Geriatric interdisciplinary teams offerthe most effective way to meet the needs of theelderly in all settings ( Box 17-3 ).Box 17-3 Research Highlight Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in function andself-efficacy that may occur in a groupof older hospitalized patients admittedto a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Methods: Data was collected on 40 pa- tients (age 65-101 years, with a meanage of 83.8) who were admitted to aninterdisciplinary geriatric rehabilitationunit. The subjects were living inde-pendently prior to admission. Findings: Improvement in self-efficacy and functional level (as measured by theFIM scale) was statistically significant.Most of the subjects were able to returnto living in the community. Conclusion: The effects of interventions by an interdisciplinary team that spe-cializes in geriatrics can positively affectolder persons' feelings of independence,ability to care for themselves, and func-tional progress. Units that specialize inthe rehabilitation of older persons andutilize a team approach with a varietyof disciplines may uniquely impactelders' ability to return home afterdischarge.

Even though age does not seem to be apredictor of CAM use, one study identified that35% of those over 64 years of age surveyed usedCAM. This figure is consistent with Eisenberg etal.'s study (1998). What Is Complementaryand Alternative Medicine? According to the National Center for Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM),CAM \"is a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that arenot presently considered part of conventionalmedicine\" in the United States (National Centerfor Complementary and Alternative Medicine[NCCAM], 2002). In their classic article onunconventional medicine in the United States,Eisenberg et al. (1993) defined unconventionalor alternative therapies as \"medical interven-tions not taught widely at U.S. medical schoolsor generally available at U.S. hospitals (p. 246).\"Although considered alternative or complemen-tary in the United States, many of the modalitiesunder this umbrella term are considered main-stream medicine in other countries (Bielory,2002). In addition, what is considered comple-mentary or alternative today may be considereda mainstream modality in 10 years. The focus ofCAM therapies is on maintaining and promot-ing health.Classifications of CAM The National Center for Complementary andAlternative Medicine classifies CAM into fivedomains: (1) alternative medical systems, (2)mind-body interventions , (3) biologically based therapies , (4) manipulative and body- based methods, and (5) energy therapies. Alternative Medical Systems Alternative medical systems are those systemsthat originated in the United States before allo-pathic medicine. Examples are homeopathicmedicine and naturopathic medicine. Home- opathy originated with German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann's natural law of \"like cureslike\" or the Principle of Similars (Kuhn, 1999;Rosser, 2004). Homeopathy remedies are pre-pared by diluting certain substances and thengradually increasing the dilution until no actualmeasurement of the original substance exists.Although there are no active ingredients in ahomeopathic solution, it helps the body to beginto heal itself using its own defense mechanisms.Homeopathic remedies are recognized and regu-lated by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA). Remedies are also listed in the Homeopathy Pharmacopoeia of the United States . According to Kuhn, homeopathic remedies enhance healingwithout harmful side effects. Homeopathy has been used to treat illnesses such as respiratory infections, headaches, earinfections, neck stiffness, postoperative infec-tions, dental pain, flu, motion sickness, and gen-eral aches and pains as well as sprains, bruises,and burns (Kuhn, 1999). Homeopathy is not aseffective as allopathy in emergencies. Naturopathic medicine focuses on keeping the person healthy. It encompasses a variety of28438_CH18_683_700.qxd 6/6/06 5:23 PM Page 684 Classifications of CAM 685 healing practices, including diet and nutrition,homeopathy, spine and soft tissue manipulation,acupuncture and acupressure, herbs, exercise,counseling, and light therapy (Kuhn, 1999). Innaturopathy, if the body is supported and barri-ers to cure are removed, the body will heal itself.There are minimal risks to naturopathic medi-cine, but natural healing may take longer thantraditional allopathic medicine. Therefore, symp-toms may last longer before they are eradicated. Traditional medical systems of non-Western cultures are also included under this category ofCAM. Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are examples of these systems. Ayurveda dates to 4500 B.C. and is rooted in the ancient Hindu medical texts called Vedas (Gormley, 2000). Sanskrit for \"knowledge orscience of life,\" Ayurveda is a comprehensivesystem that encompasses the body, mind, andconsciousness connection and seeks to restore aperson's harmony or balance. It emphasizes pre-vention and encourages maintaining health.Ayurveda includes geriatrics as one of eightmedical divisions. Practices in Ayurveda medi-cine include (1) diet, (2) exercise, (3) meditation,(4) herbs, (5) massage, (6) exposure to sunlight,(7) controlled breathing, and (8) detoxification(Pohl, 2001). According to Ayurveda, five ele-ments make up all things: (1) space or ether, (2) air, (3) fire, (4) water, and (5) earth. These ele-ments are not static, but rather always in flux. Inaddition to the five elements, Ayurveda identi-fies three types of energy, or doshas . Vata is the energy of movements and comes from ether andair. Pitta is the energy of digestion and comesfrom fire and water, and kapha comes fromwater and earth and is the energy of lubricationand structure, which keeps the cellular bodytogether (Gormley; Pohl). Each person has aunique energy pattern. Disease is caused by animbalance in the body, or disorder. Diagnosis ismade through symptomatology rather thanthrough traditional laboratory diagnostics. Thegoal of treatment is to bring the body into bal-ance. Although the Ayurvedic physician hasmany treatments available, most of the researchevaluated by the Agency for Healthcare Re-search and Quality (AHRQ) focused on herbalremedies (Southern California Evidence-BasedPractice Center, 2001). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) dates back in written form to 200 B.C. Korea, Japan, and Vietnam all have medical systems based onthe traditional medical systems in China. TCMincludes the therapies of acupuncture, herbalmedicine, massage, and meditation. Accordingto TCM, the body is a balance of two opposingforces: yinand yang . Yin represents the cold, slow, darkness, or passive principle, usually con-sidered the female aspect. Yang, on the otherhand, simulates fire and is the hot, excited, activeprinciple, usually considered the male aspect. Inthis tradition of medicine, health is balance.Disease is seen as an imbalance between yin andyang; this imbalance impedes the flow of vitalenergy ( qi or chi ) and blood along pathways called meridians (NCCAM, 2004d). The systemof qi forms the basis for diagnosis and treatmentof illness as well as for promoting health and pre-venting illness (Chen, 2001). Diagnosis of dis-harmony is made on the basis of the patient'scomplaints and report of the experience of beingsick (Fan, 2003) and evaluation of the quality ofthe pulse at nine particular points in the body, aswell as the appearance of the tongue. Acupuncture, an integral part of TCM, for example, promotes the flow of qi (chi) along themeridians, those pathways throughout the body28438_CH18_683_700.qxd 6/6/06 5:23 PM Page 685 686 Chapter 18: Alternative Health Modalities that vital energy flows through. Acupuncture isthe insertion of very thin, solid, metallic needlesat the appropriate point on the affected merid-ian. There is no comparison in allopathic med-icine. Acupuncture has been studied and thereis evidence to support its efficacy, particularly inthe area of pain management. Acupuncture releases endogenous opioids, the same mecha- nism behind the use of transcutaneous electricalnerve stimulation (TENS) (Gloth, 2001). Acupuncture is one of the treatments used in CAM. According to TCM, acupuncture correctsthe flow of qi through the body, which helpsrestore the body's balance. Acupuncture iswidely used in the United States, and researchhas shown its efficacy in treating adult postop-erative and chemotherapy nausea and vomitingand postoperative dental pain. Promising resultshave been shown in the treatment of headache,stroke rehabilitation, osteoarthritis, low backpain, carpel tunnel syndrome, and asthma, butmore research needs to be done to support theefficacy of acupuncture in treating these syn-dromes (NIH Consensus Development Panel onAcupuncture, 1998). Qi gong is widely practiced in Chinese hos- pitals and clinics, but there have been no largeclinical trials outside China to support this prac-tice. Qi gong refers to exercises that improvehealth and increase a sense of harmony. It is thepractice of manipulating qi (chi) through move-ment and meditation. Mind-Body Interventions Mind-body interventions are among the mostwidely used of the complementary/alternativemodalities (Barnes et al., 2004). Among thetherapies included in this category are prayer,deep breathing, meditation, yoga, biofeedback,tai chi, and guided imagery ( Table 18-1 ). Other modalities that would fit under this category arepet therapy and music therapy. Mind-body in-terventions acknowledge that emotional, men-tal, social, spiritual, and behavioral factors candirectly affect health (NCCAM, 2004c). Themind-body connection entails two immune cells. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway signals theendocrine system to release hormones, particu-larly thyroid and adrenal hormones, which havea direct effect on the immune system (Maier-Lorentz). The impact of stressors and hormoneson the immune system is discussed in Chapter 6. Several of the mind-body interventions have their roots in religious traditions.

In a report released bythe National Center for Health Statistics, 45%of the adults surveyed in 2002 had used prayerfor health or spiritual healing during the past 12months (Barnes et al., 2004). Belief in God or ahigher being is not required for prayer to occurbecause prayer may be defined as turning one'sheart and mind to the sacred (Ameling, 2000).Some researchers and practitioners support thebelief that prayer facilitates healing (Dossey,1993; Byrd, 1988). Although prayer is widelyused and accepted, research studies supportingthe value of prayer and healing have led toinconclusive results (Gundersen, 2000; Maier-Lorentz, 2004; Sending Prayers, 2002; Sicher,Targ, Moore, & Smith, 1998). Difficulties inmethods, including treating prayer, religion, andspirituality as the same concept, may be respon-sible for some of the mixed results (Gundersen;Maier-Lorentz). Meditation is closely related to prayer; it is a conscious process that induces therelaxation response (NCCAM, 2004c). There aretwo types of meditation. In concentrative med-itation, the individual focuses on a mantra,sound, or visual image and is able to quiet themind by concentrating on this focal point. Thesecond type of meditation, mindfulness or vipas-sana meditation, begins with the individualfocusing on breathing and continues until theindividual develops a nonjudgmental awarenessof the present. Meditation can be practiced byindividuals of all ages and has been used toreduce stress, promote relaxation, and removepain from the main focus of an individual'smind (Ott, 2004; Roberts, 2004). The practice of yoga, which has its roots in India, integrates physical, mental, and spiritualhealth so the individual can be in harmony withthe universe. There are different schools of yogaand each has a different focus, but basicallyyoga combines disciplined breathing, definedgestures, and specific postures ( asanas ) to achieve a sense of harmony. Studies have supported thebenefits of yoga for a wide variety of medical con-ditions and a wide variety of ages (Raub, 2002). Imagery is any perception that comes through the senses (Naparstek, 1994). Sights, sounds,smells, or tastes can be used to create mentalimages to aid in relaxation and manage physicalsymptoms or stress and anxiety. These createdmental images, called guided imagery , are con- sidered a powerful self-help technique that iseasy to learn and can be used by individuals of allages (Menzies & Taylor, 2004; Miller, 2003). Biofeedback is now used in traditional ther- apies as well as complementary and alternativetherapies. An individual uses machines to receiveinformation about bodily functions such as skintemperature, brain waves (electroencephalogra-phy [EEG]), breathing, blood pressure, and heartrate. The individual receives information aboutthe function in the form of audible or visual sig-nals and is trained to focus on controlling the tar-geted bodily function. Reinforcement is receivedthrough feedback from the audible or visual sig-nals. With practice, the individual becomes moreskilled at controlling the targeted function.Eventually, the individual can control the func-tion without the use of the machine to providefeedback. Studies have demonstrated that bio-feedback has been used successfully to control avariety of symptoms such as headaches, chronicpain, hot flashes, and incontinence (Kuhn, 1999). Another mind-body therapy not listed in the NCCAM categories is pet-assisted therapy , or pet-assisted visitation. Pet-assisted therapy andvisitation is gaining in popularity, especiallywith children and older adults. A variety of ani-mals (dogs, cats, horses, and rabbits) have beenused to decrease stress and increase feelings ofwell-being. Although sometimes the terms areused synonymously, animal-assisted Alternative Health Modalities different from animal-assisted visitation. Inanimal-assisted visitation, certified therapy ani-mals visit patients and families in a commonroom or at the bedside. A trained professional, onthe other hand, performs animal-assisted therapy(Stanley-Hermanns & Miller, 2002). Researchstudies tend to support the effectiveness of pet-assisted visitation and therapy (Hooker, Freeman,& Stewart, 2002; Stanley-Hermanns & Miller).To initiate a pet therapy or visitation program,disease prevention strategies must be undertaken.Animals must be examined by a veterinarian tomake sure they are free of any disease or parasitesand are up to date on vaccinations. Animalsshould be bathed within 24 hours before visitingand should be under the handler's control at alltimes (Stanley-Hermanns & Miller). Biologically Based Therapies In CAM, biologically based therapies includethose substances found in nature, includingherbs, vitamins, foods (including dietary sup-plements), and other natural but scientificallyunproven therapies such as elk horn and sharkcartilage (NCCAM, 2002). Vegetarian, macro-biotic, Atkins, Pritikin, Ornish, and diets included this med- Table Diets Listed under Biologically Based Therapies Diet DescriptionAtkins Diet emphasizes low carbohydrates (40 grams or less daily) with an increase in fat and protein (Barnes et al., 2004). Macrobiotic Low-fat diet emphasizes whole grains and vegetables and a decrease in fluid intake.Meat, dairy products, eggs, alcohol, sugar, sweets, coffee, and caffeinated teasare avoided. Ornish High-fiber, low-fat vegetarian diet; promotes weight loss by restricting the types of food rather than calories. Pritikin Low-fat (10% or less) diet emphasizes consumption of foods with a large volume of fiber and water (low in calorie density). Diet includes manyvegetables, fruits, beans, and unprocessed grains. Zone Each meal consists of 30% low-fat protein, 30% fat, and 40% fiber-rich fruits and vegetables. The goal of this diet is to control key hormone production toalter metabolism. Vegetarian A diet that excludes meat, fish, fowl, or products containing these foods.Lacto-ovo vegetarian Diet is based on grains, vegetables, fruit, seeds, nuts, legumes, dairy products, and eggs. It excludes meat, fish, and fowl. Lacto vegetarian Diet excludes eggs, meat, fish, and fowl, but includes dairy products. Vegan vegetarian Diet excludes dairy, eggs, meat, fish, fowl, and other animal products.

(2004) nearly 19% of adults whoused complementary and alternative medicinewithin the past year used nonvitamin and nat-ural products; nearly 3.5% used diet therapies.Because this category includes natural products,individuals, particularly the elderly, may havethe mistaken belief that there are no side effectsor concerns in using these products. However,caution must be taken in using these productswith certain prescribed medications.Table 18-3 displays the 10 natural products used most often by those who used comple-mentary and alternate medicine in the year pre-ceding the national survey. In addition to thewidely used herbal supplements in Table 18-3,other herbs are frequently used. Valerian root isused as a sedative and sleep aid. It should not beused in conjunction with alcohol, sedatives, oranti-anxiety medication. Side effects includemild headache or upset stomach; it is not addic-tive.

It is used foranxiety, stress, restlessness, and insomnia. Its useis contraindicated in individuals with liver dis-ease or depression. It should not be used withanti-depressives, alcohol, or tranquilizers. Sideeffects include dizziness, headache, (Deglin used fortreating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),and studies have supported its efficacy (Ernst,2002; Gordon & Shaughnessy, 2003). Sideeffects include mild gastrointestinal upset; thereare no reported drug interactions. The biggestconcern about the use of saw palmetto is thatindividuals may self-medicate without verifyingthe diagnosis of BPH, and, therefore, more seri-ous diseases of the prostate could be missed.Capsaicin, derived from hot peppers, is usedtopically to relieve pain from neuralgias andosteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Capsaicinproduces a stinging or burning sensation wheninitially used. Clients should be instructed tokeep capsaicin away from the eyes and other sen-sitive areas of the body (Medline Plus, 2005). Even though herbs are natural products, some herbal medications have side effects that couldhave adverse effects for the elderly. Yohimbe isused to treat impotence. Although it has beenshown to be effective, it is not recommended bythe FDA. When combined with tricyclic antide-pressants, side effects include hypertension, renalfailure, seizures, hypotension, diarrhea, and sprains and pulled liga-ments. Because of the potential side effect of livertoxicity when ingested, the FDA has identifiedcomfrey as a possible health hazard; however, thehazard is significantly less when used as a com-press. The FDA also proposed a limit to theamount of ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supple-ments (ephedra, Ma Huang, Chinese ephedra).The use of ephedrine has been linked with ner-vousness, dizziness, heart attack, stroke, seizures,and death (An FDA Guide, 2004). Consumersmust be instructed to read labels because ephed-rine may be an ingredient on supplements im-ported from other countries. Ginko, commonlyused for memory improvement, affects clottingtime. There are many potential cardiac side effectsand interaction with herbal medications. Although most of the herbal medications are safe when used as recommended, the concern isthat many older adults do not tell their nursepractitioners, physicians, or other health careproviders about the herbal medications they aretaking. This increases the possibility of druginteractions (Astin, Pelletier, Marie, & Haskell,2000). Also, many times health providers do notask their patients about what natural substancesthey are taking (Milden & Stokols, 2004). Pa-tients taking prescription drugs such as bloodthinners, blood pressure medications, cyclospo-rine, digoxin, hypoglycemic should avoidherbal 2002; Williamson,Fletcher, & Dawson, 2003). In addition, manysafety concerns and drug interactions are under-researched in the elderly. Consumers should becautioned when using herbal remedies to buyonly reputable products, as the FDA does notregulate herb manufacturing ( Case Study 18-1 ). Manipulation and Body-BasedPractices Manipulation and body-based practices primarilyfocus on the structures and systems of the body.These practices are not new; some are rooted intraditional medical systems and others have28438_CH18_683_700.qxd 6/6/06 5:23 PM Page 691 692 Chapter 18: Alternative Health Modalities been practiced in the United States for over 150years. Those practitioners of manipulation andbody-based practices believe that parts of thebody are interdependent and the body has theability to heal itself. Chiropractic and osteo-pathic manipulation, massage therapy, reflexol-ogy, and rolfing are examples of practices fromthis category (NCCAM, 2000b). Both chiro-practic care and massage were among the 10most used CAM therapies (Barnes et al., 2004). Chiropractic practice is considered a holis- tic approach to health. It is thought to providebenefit by helping place the body in properalignment. Many third-party payers for healthcare provide some reimbursement for chiro-practic care. Although satisfaction with chiro-practic care is high (Hertzman-Miller, 2002;NCCAM, 2000b), empirical evidence about efficacy 2003; NCCAM, 2000b). Massage therapy includes various techniques that involve the manipulation of soft tissuethrough pressure and movement. Massage pro-motes circulation of blood and lymph, stimulatesnerve endings, increases nutrients to the tissues,and removes waste products (Mitzel-Wilkinson,2000). Many individuals use massage therapy toincrease relaxation and reduce stress, to recoverfrom muscle stress and strain, and to heal injuries.

Although massage is consid-ered a low-risk intervention, it is contraindicatedunder several circumstances including deep veinthrombosis, burns, skin infections, eczema, openwounds, bone fractures, and advanced osteoporo-sis (NCCAM, 2000b). Energy Medicine Energy medicine encompasses two basic types ofenergy fields: veritable, which can be measured,and putative, which currently cannot be mea-sured. Examples of veritable energy fields in- clude mechanical vibration and electromagneticforces. Putative energy fields (biofields) include the vital energy (qi or chi) of TCM or doshas inAyurvedic medicine. These forces currently can-not be measured, but therapists claim they workwith this energy to improve health by reducingpain and anxiety, increasing wound healing, andproviding a sense of well-being. (NCCAM,2004a). Examples of practices using putativeenergy fields include Reiki, qi gong, healing (ortherapeutic) touch, and prayer for the health ofothers (intercessory prayer). As a group, these arethe most controversial CAM practices because theenergy fields cannot be measured, making tradi-tional scientific research methodology difficult. In addition, several modalities considered un- der this category could also be included underother categories of CAM, such as traditional med-ical systems. This can add some confusion to theCAM categories and, consequently, to consumers.It also illustrates that many of the CAM modali-ties cannot be investigated in isolation, but,rather, must be studied within the larger context. Therapeutic touch, healing touch, and Reiki all involve movement of a practitioner's handsover the patient's body to balance energy fields(NCCAM, 2004a). Reiki is a form of healingthrough the manipulation of ki (Japanese forlife energy; similar to Chinese qi). There isanecdotal and small study support for thesemodalities. Several electromagnetic fields, part of verita- ble energy medicine, have been used in conven-tional medicine. Magnetic resonance imagery,cardiac pacemakers, transcutaneous electricalnerve stimulators (TENs), and radiation therapyare all examples of energy usage. Other veritableenergy modalities include magnetic therapy,which is the use of static magnets to relieve painor increase energy levels. Anecdotal reports sup-port the efficacy of static magnets, but more sci-entific research is needed to support this therapy(NCCAM, 2004a). Sound energy therapy includes music ther- apy. The basis of sound energy therapy is that spe-cific sound frequencies can facilitate the body'shealing (NCCAM, 2004a). Literature supportingmusic therapy is mixed, depending on the type ofmusic and patient care setting (Gagner-Tjellesen& Yurkovich, 2001; Wong, Lopez-Nahas, &Molassiotis, 2001). Many times, music therapy iscombined with guided imagery to help reducepain and anxiety. This is an example of the over-lap between energy and mind-body modalities. Light therapy has been used to treat seasonal affective disorder successfully, but other uses donot have as much empirical support (NCCAM,2004a). This is an area for further research. Reasons for CAM Use Older adults use CAM for pain relief, to increasequality of life, and to maintain health and fit-ness (Astin et al., 2000; Williamson et al.,2003). Some view CAM as a return to a \"kinderand gentler medicine\" (Barrett et al., 2004);however, most use CAM in combination withconventional medication rather than as a pri-mary source of treatment (Barnes et al., 2004;Bausell, Lee, & Berman, 2001), and most rely on28438_CH18_683_700.qxd 6/6/06 5:23 PM Page 693 694 Chapter 18: Alternative Health Modalities family and friends provide information aboutchoosing a modality (Najm, Reinsch, Hoehler,& Tobis, 2003). As a rule, elders choose CAMbecause of the belief system behind the modal-ity, not because they are dissatisfied with con-ventional care (Smith, 2004). However, thenurse cannot overlook the fact the some eldersmay use CAM because they may have difficultyaccessing traditional medical care or medica-tions (Pagan & Pauly, 2005) ( Box 18-1 ).

TheWorld Health Organization (WHO) estimatesthat 80% of the world's someform of CAM (Bielory, 2002; Milden & Stokols,2004), so knowledge about CAM may be consid-ered part of culturally competent care (Cuellar,Cahill, Ford, & Aycock, 2003). When performingassessments, nurses must ask clients about theiruse of CAM, why particular modalities are used,the source of the therapy, and their knowledge ofside effects (King, Pettigrew, & Reed, 2000).These questions should be phrased in a nonjudg-mental manner and should in such a way as tocover the variety of modalities. Clients may not28438_CH18_683_700.qxd 6/6/06 5:23 PM Page 694 Nursing Interventions 695 acknowledge they are taking herbal medicines,but may identify that they are taking naturalproducts. This is particularly important whenclients are on prescribed medications for bloodthinning, blood pressure, depression, anxiety, andinsomnia. Also, elders may not consider vitaminsor minerals as medications because they are con-sidered dietary supplements; however, if taken inconjunction with some prescribed medications orin large doses, vitamins may interfere with theactions of the medications and produce sideeffects. Good communication skills are key to athorough assessment of CAM use. Integrated care,a combination of allopathy and CAM, may be thebest model of care for an older adult. Many healthcare professions include CAM courses in the cur-riculum. The nurse must be a knowledgeablemember of this integrated health care team to beable to provide comprehensive, holistic care(Killinger, Morley, Kettner, & Kauric, 2001) (Box 18-2 ).

Think about what CAM therapies you have used personally. If you have not used any, think about one therapy you think you may want to try. Why did you use CAM, orwhy would you use CAM? Think about patients you have worked with who have usedCAM. What was your reaction to the information? Have you changed you mindabout CAM since reading the chapter? Did the patients use CAM for the same rea-sons you did, or thought you may? 2. Look through your local newspaper for a week. What references to CAM do you find? How many references were directed at the older adult? Were you surprised by whatyou found? Box 18-3 Research Highlight Aim: This small pilot study investigated the effects of a guided imagery intervention on patients 55 years and older. All patients were men and scheduled for knee or hip replace-ment at a veteran's hospital. Methods: A two-group, repeated measures experimental design was used to measure the effects of guided imagery on pain and anxiety scores, pain medication use, and lengths of stay.The control group received the usual preoperative and postoperative care, which includeda tape of relaxing music. In addition to the usual preoperative and postoperative care, theintervention group received a guided imagery tape developed by Belleruth Naparstek. Datawere collected using patient surveys, patient journals, chart reviews, pain VAS to measurepain, Profile of Mood States instrument to measure anxiety, and SF-12 to measure physicalfunctioning, and a researcher developed a questionnaire to measure satisfaction with theguided imagery tapes. Findings: The intervention group demonstrated better pain relief, decreased anxiety, and decreased length of stay. The intervention group also used less pain medication. Because ofthe small sample size, only descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Conclusions: Although this was a small sample size, the findings did tend to support guided imagery as an effective adjunctive intervention for pain management in elderly orthopedicpatients. Additional studies need to be conducted to support these findings. Source: Antall, G. F., & Kresevic, D. (2004). The use of guided imagery to manage pain in an elderly orthopaedic population.

KEY TERMS Active aging Autonomy 703 Independence Quality of life28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 703 704 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life Quality of life is a concept that has many defi- nitions; to date there is no consensus regardingthe meaning of the the term. Given the concept'smultidisciplinary nature, it has been defined asa degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with life(Abrams, 1973; Campbell, Converse, Hanestad, and as dimen-sions such as health function, comfort, emotionalresponse, economics, spirituality, and social sup-port (Gough, Furnival, Schilder, & Grove, 1983;Patterson, 1975). Older people talk about qual-ity of life in terms of family relationships, socialcontacts and activities, general health, and func-tional status (Farquhar, 1995a). Quality of life is \"an individual's perception of his or her position in life in the context of theculture and value system where they live and inrelation to their goals, expectations, standardsand concerns. It is a broad-ranging concept,incorporating a person's physical health, psy-chological state, level of independence, socialrelationships, personal beliefs and relationshipsto salient features in the environment\" (WHO,1994, p. 90). As people age, their quality of lifeis dependent upon their ability to maintainautonomy and independence. Model of Quality of Life Grant, Ferrell, Schmidt, Fonbuena, Niland, andForman (1992) have proposed a model forunderstanding the components of quality of life.The Ferrell and Grant quality of life model(Figure 19-1 ) was developed using qualitative methodology. Factor analysis of patient data was Quality of LifePhysical Well-Beingand Symptoms Psychological Well-Being Social Well-Being Spiritual Well-BeingFigure 19-1 Quality of life model.

Subsequent cross-cultural work withAfrican Americans and Mexican Americans hasprovided evidence that the elements of themodel appropriately reflect quality of life forthese populations. The Ferrell and Grant model identifies the four concepts of quality of life: physical well-being,psychological well-being, social well-being, andspiritual well-being. Table 19-1 displays the major concepts of this model. Health services researchers typically identify quality of life as dimensions of health (physicaland psychological) and functional status (Farquhar,1995b). Much of the conceptual framework formeasuring quality of life is derived from theWorld Health Organization's (WHO) definitionof health. The WHO defines health as a state ofcomplete physical, mental, and social well-being(WHO, 1958). These are all components ofquality of life. So is there a distinction betweenhealth and quality of life? The WHO has inte-grated health and quality of life into a programcalled active aging . This program is designed to help people remain independent and active asthey age. Active aging encourages older indi-viduals to continue to work according to theircapacity and to delay disabilities and chronicdiseases. Active aging is being promoted by theWHO as a process of optimizing opportunitiesfor health, participation in the community, andsafe living in order to enhance quality of life aspeople age (WHO, 2002, p. 12). Maintainingquality of life is at the center of active aging. Thischapter will look at each of the determinantsdescribed by the WHO program on active aging. Active Aging The term active aging was adopted by the WHO in the late 1990s to allow inclusion of additionalfactors related to healthy aging. This approach isbased on the human rights of older people andthe United Nations' principles of independence,participation, dignity, care, and self-fulfillment.Such an approach requires thinking to shift from\"needs-based\" to \"rights-based\" in treatment asan individual grows older. This supports an indi-vidual's right to receive interventions to enhanceautonomy, independence , and activity. An active aging approach to strategies that promote quality of life has the potential todecrease disabilities associated with chronic ill-ness; increase elders' participation in the social,cultural, economic, and political aspects of soci-ety; and lower the cost of medical treatment.These interventions recognize the need to en-courage individuals to plan and prepare for older Table 19-1 Physical, Psychological, Social, and Spiritual Well-Being Physical Psychological Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life age and to choose healthy lifestyles. Activeaging can enhance and ensure one's quality oflife in later years. The World Health Organization has identi- fied determinants of health that affect aging andthe quality of life of individuals, communities,and nations. Healthy aging is influenced bygender and culture in addition to the followingdeterminants: behavioral, social and physicalenvironments; personal, economic, and socialservice systems. Behavioral determinants includephysical activity, nutrition, smoking, alcohol,and medication adherence. Determinants relatedto personal characteristics include genetics andpsychological factors. Physical environmentdeterminants include neighborhoods and safehousing. Social support, education and literacy,violence, and abuse make up the social environ-ment determinants. Economic determinantsinclude income and social protection. Deter-minants related to social services include healthpromotion and disease prevention. Box 19-1 Research Highlight Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the correlates of quality of life in home-dwelling and institutionalized elderly. Methods: One hundred and fifty-two elderly residents of long-term care homes and 160 community-dwelling elderly participated in the study. Assessment included demographicand social variables, health status, nutritional state, and physical and cognitive function.Physical activity was assessed by two questionnaires: the Seven Day Recall PAQuestionnaire and the Stanford Usual Activity Questionnaire. Quality of life was assessedwith the Euroqol 5D questionnaire. Findings: Depression was the most powerful predictor of quality of life in both community- dwelling and institutionalized elderly. Complaints associated with the musculoskeletalsystem in community-dwelling elders and manifestations of atherosclerosis and cardiovas-cular disease in institutionalized elders were the most important concomitant diseases.Regular participation in physical activity, preventing obesity, and maintaining adequatelevels of physical and cognitive function contributed more to overall quality of life incommunity dwellers than in older and frailer institutionalized elderly adults. Conclusions: The relative contribution of functional and medical comorbidities, as well as health-promoting behaviors, to quality of life may be different in community-dwellingversus institutionalized elders. Physical and cognitive function deficits, overweight/obesity, and lack of regular activity are among the primary predictors of decreased qualityof life in home-dwelling elders. In institutionalized elders, the role of concomitantdiseases is the dominant factor in quality of life. Source: Borowiak, E., & Kostka, T. (2004).

In many countriesfemales have a lower social status and less accessto food, education, and health care; however,males are more likely to engage in behaviorssuch as smoking, alcohol, drug consumption,and strenuous labor. Values and traditions deter-mine how a society views aging. Some societiesview aging as a natural period of decline with-out expectations of a high quality of life, andthus are less likely to provide prevention, earlydetection, and tailored interventions for the el-derly when symptoms are attributed to theaging process. Aging is viewed as a life process,one in which ultimate deterioration is expectedand should be accepted. Health-seeking behav-iors also are influenced by culture and values.Enhancing individual quality of life mustrespect diverse ethnicities while educating toovercome folk medicine beliefs or prejudiceagainst formal biomedicine. Behavioral Determinants Behavioral determinants refer to behaviors that promote healthy lifestyles. Healthy behaviorsare just as important to older persons as to theyoung. Aging should not deter an individualfrom improving quality of life through engag-ing in physical activity, healthy eating, socialsupport, and medication compliance as well asavoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake. Physical ActivityThe literature is clear that physical activity, evenif initiated in later years, contributes to high phys-ical and cognitive functioning, overall health, andengagement with life (Aranceta, Oguma, & Lee, 2002). Specifically, physical activity contributes tomuscle strength, flexibility, balance, cardiovas-cular health, and positive mood, and improvescognition. It has also been found to prevent fallsand improve brain function, even after braininjury (Aranceta et al.; Houde & Melillo;Mattson et al.). Physical activity as well as re-sistance exercise training have been found topromote muscle functioning in elders bystrengthening muscles, improving flexibilityand strength, and preventing muscle loss(Schulte & Yarasheski, 2001; Thompson, 2002).Participation in moderate-intensity physicalactivity (Aranceta et al.; Mattson et al.; Oguma et al.). Seniors who engage in an active lifestyleimprove their physical well-being and socialactivities (Aranceta et al.). Conversely, physicalinactivity is associated with muscle atrophy,reduced endurance and muscle strength,increased falls, and increased mortality (Ogumaet al.; Thompson). Physical inactivity leads to adecline in physical function and recreational andsocial opportunities. Dependence on others forassistance with activities of daily living is a crit-ical outcome resulting from decreased activity,and predicts loss of independence and nursinghome admission (Oguma et al., 2002; Schulte &Yarasheski; Thompson; Wilkins, 2001). Physicalactivity is essential for optimal physical, cogni-tive, and emotional functioning. Therefore,physical activity may be the primary factor forpromoting optimal aging. Benefits of Exercise. The potential for reg- ular exercise to offset the deleterious effects ofaging is well established. In fact, the pro-nounced health benefits attributed to regularexercise, including improvements in restingblood pressure, cholesterol profile, osteoarthri-tis, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and cogni-tive functioning, can be achieved even in thoseindividuals who start physical conditioning28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 707 708 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life programs later in life. Yet, despite these impres-sive data, approximately 70% of elderlyAmericans are physically inactive (King, 2001).A hypokinetic state not only negatively affectsthe health status of the elderly, but also signifi-cantly influences health care costs as moreAmericans are attaining octogenarian status.Health care workers should actively encourageelderly individuals to maintain or start an exer-cise program. Such recommendations may helpto decrease comorbid conditions associated withthe aging process, increase functional inde-pendence, and attenuate skyrocketing healthcare costs associated with treating the growingelderly population (Dejong & Franklin, 2004). Many studies have examined the benefits of exercise in frail elders living in skilled nursingfacilities, where the effect of group-centeredinterventions is easy to assess (Fisher, Pendergast,& Calkins, & Nitta, 1995). Theseinstitutionalized populations, who often havevarying degrees of cognitive impairment, can bechallenging, both when trying to establishmotivation for exercise and when creatingopportunities for group reinforcement and par-ticipation. Study variables on which exerciseinterventions have had an impact include thosedirectly related to the exercise itself\u2014changesin mobility or strength. More indirect but per-haps more functionally relevant benefits alsoaccrue from exercise, such as improved sleep,improved mood, and overall well-being of theparticipants (King, Rejeski, & Buchner, 1998).Older adults may be easily discouraged by abelief that for exercise to be beneficial, one mustwalk very fast, lift weights at a gym, or exerciseevery day. Many exercise programs for theelderly that have extended independence andimproved activities of daily living include verysimple regimens such as lifting cans of vegetablesof varying weights, doing leg lifts from a sittingposition, or walking lengths of the hall a fewtimes in one's home a couple of times a day. Oneshould set very low goals to guarantee success.Diaries have been shown to be effective in in-creasing activity. Any movement is better thannone, so every little activity should be encour-aged (van der Bij, Laurant, & Wensing, 2002). Physical activity interventions are not always effective because older adults often do not com-ply with planned exercise for the long term. Forolder adults, interventions should be tailored toindividuals' preferences and should be directedtoward home-based intervention. Intense long-term strategies and behavioral strategies willpromote adherence (van der Bij et al., 2002). Individuals living at home must be coached about completing a safety check to ensure a safepathway through their home. Establishing handrails along a hall can ensure safety for those indi-viduals with health concerns such as dizziness orfor whom conditions may force them to stayinside. Others may benefit from watching andmoving with a televised program; for example,a colleague reported that after working with Af-rican Americans in a housing development, byhaving them play Motown records and dancearound for 20 minutes a day, they were later ableto increase their ability to walk around thebuilding. Health care providers may do well touse neutral words such as movement or activity rather than exercise , which raises self-expectations to an extreme for some. One major intervention study conducted in a supervised group setting used daytime arm andleg exercises as a means to improve the sleep ofnursing home residents. The investigators foundthat participants' quality and quantity of sleep28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 708 Active Aging 709 improved by about 40% during subsequentnighttime observations (Alessi, Yoon, Schnelle,Al-Samarrai, & Cruise, 1993). Another institu-tionally based study examined the effect ofweight-training on strength and stair climbingin a selected group of very old (mean age 87years) nursing home residents (Fiatarone et al.,1994). Participants assigned to the interventiongroup receiving a socialization intervention hadenhanced overall mobility compared with thecontrol group. This study provides the best evi-dence that exercise can produce short-term,highly relevant improvements for even the old-est frail elders. In another group of nursinghome patients for whom stair climbing was con-sidered well beyond their functional capacity, astructured strength-training program usingresistance exercise of upper extremities dramat-ically improved spontaneous activity (Evans,1999). Interventions to promote physical activity in older adults can be organized by level of impactusing individual and interpersonal approachesthrough environmental- and societal-level inter-ventions (King, 1991). Interventions that facil-itate physical activity among the elderly includegoal setting, self-monitoring, feedback, support,stimulus control, and relapse-prevention train-ing (Young & King, 1995). Using both positiveself-talk and goal setting produces greater phys-ical activity adherence (Atkins, Kaplan, Timms,Reinsh, & Lofback, 1984). Also useful is tele-phone supervision and home-based physical ac-tivity programs (King, Haskell, Taylor, Kraemer,& DeBunk, 1991).NutritionThe literature provides evidence that propernutrition is a powerful, modifiable lifestyle fac-tor that may delay or prevent chronic diseases inlater life and, more importantly, will potentiallylead to additional years of health, productivity,and high functioning. For those who are inac-tive, good nutrition enhances skin integrity andprevents skin breakdown (Shikany & White,2000). However, older adults may be at risk forinadequate nutrition because of physiologicalchanges related to organ function declines,which can affect digestion, metabolism, andabsorption of nutrients (Lueckenotte, 2000).Additionally, older adults' nutritional intakemay be compromised because of the develop-ment of poor eating habits related to chewing orswallowing difficulties as well as diminishedinterest in food resulting from sensory loss (e.g.,taste and smell) (Swartzberg, Margen, andEditors 2001). Physically active seniors' dietsare relatively higher in dairy products and fruitsthan are the diets of sedentary older adults(Aranceta et al., 2001). Proper nutrition, withan emphasis on consuming fruits and vegeta-bles, has long-term health benefits and con-tributes to physical, cognitive, and overallwell-being (Lange-Collette, 2002; Pullen &Walker, 2002). However the costs associatedwith healthier foods on a limited budget are anissue for many elderly. Evidence suggests that adequate nutrition has great benefits; however, researchers havenoted that many older adults are deficient inparticular vitamins and minerals, including vit-amins B 6, B12, D, K, and folic acid, and the antioxidant vitamins A, C, E, and beta carotene,as well as the minerals selenium, calcium, andiron, which are essential for overall health (Fillitet al., 2002). Cognitive function can be im-pacted by nutrition; specifically, malnutritioncan cause long-term cognitive impairment (Fillitet al.). Research findings also indicate that el-ders with various vitamin deficiencies, especially28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 709 710 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life of B12, may be at risk for cognitive disorders (including dementia) that were previously con-sidered to be due to normal cognitive aging;other nutrients, such as antioxidants and vita-min C, may be protective against cognitive de-cline (Fillit et al.; Mattson et al., 2002). Other dietary factors associated with health in advancing age, particularly for women, may bethe consumption of significantly lower percent-ages of calories from fat and a higher percentageof calories from complex carbohydrates (Klein etal., 2004). In relation to dietary fats, future healthin both men and women was predicted by higherbaseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol lev-els, as well as lower low-density lipoprotein cho-lesterol levels for women. Eating a healthy diethas been found to assist with weight reductionand decrease serum cholesterol and has been asso-ciated with decreasing incidence of coronaryartery disease (CAD), diabetes, colon cancer, andosteoporosis, although these require early dietaryintervention (Lange-Collette, 2002). Additional findings suggest that optimal cal- cium intake is critically related to reducing therisk of bone loss and osteoporosis and decreasingthe incidence of fractures in both men andwomen (Shikany & White, 2002). A diet withhigh soy protein combined with regular weight-bearing physical activity may protect againstosteoporosis (Lange-Collette, 2002). Osteoporosiscan prevent optimal physical activity and, inturn, participation in social and communityrecreational activities, thus denying the benefitsof such participation. Dietary intake is oftenassociated with income and living arrange-ments. It is clear that health care providers mustbe sensitive to individuals' income levels andability to apply for public assistance as well ascultural constraints on food selections. Someindividuals may benefit from having a high-potency vitamin prescribed so that their insur-ance or pharmacy plan may cover the costs.Others may be unaware of simple requirementssuch as the amount of protein recommended ona daily basis. Health care providers should con-sider the individual's budget and realize thatfresh vegetables and fruit may be cost prohibi-tive. Always ask the person to make out a gro-cery list or save store receipts so that the healthcare provider can help the individual review hisor her choices.SmokingIn countries that report deaths that are attrib-utable to smoking, cigarettes were responsiblefor an estimated 21 million deaths from 1990 to1999, with more than half of those deaths occur-ring in people 35 to 69 years of age (Joint Com-mittee on Smoking and Health, 1995). The 1990report of the Surgeon General differentiatessmoking-related deaths in the United States bydisease category. Cigarette smoking accountsannually for an estimated 115,000 deaths fromheart disease, 106,000 deaths from lung cancer,32,000 deaths from other cancers, 57,000deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease (COPD), and 27,500 deaths from strokes(U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-vices, 1990). In addition to these extraordinarymortality rates, the annual direct financial bur-den of smoking is estimated to exceed $50 bil-lion, which is about one tenth of all health carecosts in the United States each year (Herdman,Hewitt, & Laschober, 1993). Currently, 26.4%of adult men and 22.0% of adult women in theUnited States smoke, representing 47.2 millionlives (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion [CDC], 2004). Smoking is the single most important pre- ventable risk factor to human health in developed28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 710 Active Aging 711 countries and an important cause of prematuredeath worldwide (Joint Committee on Smokingand Health, 1995). Each year, more than 70%of all smokers have at least one visit to a physi-cian for a respiratory problem (CDC, 2004).Approximately 35% of smokers report havingmade a serious attempt to quit smoking over thelast year (Hatziandreu et al., 1990) and 80%report an attempt to quit sometime in their past(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,1989). A population-based survey (Goldstein etal., 1997) found that less than 15% of smokerswho saw a physician in the past year were of-fered assistance in quitting smoking and only3% had a follow-up appointment to addresstobacco use. The first step in treating tobacco use and dependence is to identify tobacco users. Theeffective identification of tobacco use status notonly opens the doors for successful interventions,but also guides clinicians to identify appropriateinterventions based on a patient's willingness toquit. A guideline that was developed by a private-sector panel of experts convened by a consortiumof federal and non-federal partners recommendedthe implementation of an office-wide protocolthat systematically solicits and documents thetobacco-use status of each patient at every visit.Such a practice can be done effectively by expand-ing the number of vital signs to include smokingstatus or by placing an appropriate tobacco-usesticker on all patient charts. In clinical settingswhere tobacco use has been universally docu-mented, the rate at which physicians then askedtheir patients about smoking and provided spe-cific advice on quitting approximately doubled(Fiore et al., 1995). The 2000 guideline documents that clinical interventions as brief as 3 minutes can substan-tially increase cessation success. This findingsupports the idea that a personalized clinicianmessage meaningfully enhances the likelihoodthat a smoker will make a successful attempt toquit smoking. Therefore, it is essential to pro-vide at least a brief intervention for all tobaccousers at each clinic visit. Because effective tobacco dependence treat- ments are available, every patient who usestobacco should be offered at least one of the fol-lowing treatments: 1. Patients willing to try to quit using tobacco should be provided with treat-ments that are identified as effective inthe guideline. 2. Patients unwilling to try to quit using tobacco should be provided with a briefintervention that is designed to increasetheir motivation to quit. For Patients Willing to Quit: The 5 As. The \"5As\" were designed as a brief and effectiveintervention for tobacco users willing to makean attempt to quit smoking ( Table 19-2 ). It is important for the clinician to ask patientswhether they use tobacco; to advise them to quitin a clear, strong, and personalized manner; andto assess their willingness to make an attemptto quit at that time. If the patient agrees toattempt cessation, the clinician should thenassist in making a quit attempt and shouldarrange for follow-up contacts to prevent arelapse ( Box 19-2 ). For Patients Not Ready to Quit: The 5Rs. For patients not willing to make an attempt toquit at the time of an assessment or hospitaladmission, health professionals should providea brief intervention that is designed to promotethe motivation to quit (the \"5 Rs\"; Table 19-3 ). Patients may be unwilling to make an attemptto quit for a variety of reasons.

They may not realize howside effects of smoking are relevant to their per-sonal health history. These patients may, how-ever, respond to a motivational intervention thatprovides the health care provider an opportunityto educate and reassure the patient by means ofthe following 5 Rs: relevance, risks, rewards,roadblocks, and repetition (Colby et al., 1998;Prochaska & Goldstein, 1991). Pharmacotherapies for Smoking Cessation. Numerous effective pharmacotherapies for smok-ing cessation now exist. Except in the presenceof contraindication(s), these should be used withall patients who are attempting to quit smok-ing. The treatment of tobacco dependence, likethe treatment of other chronic diseases, requiresthe use of multiple modalities. Pharmacother-apy is an essential element of a multicomponentapproach. The five first-line medications with an estab- lished empirical record of efficacy in smokingcessation are 19-4 . Combining the patch with a self-administered form of nicotine replacementtherapy (NRT), such as the gum, the inhaler, orthe nasal spray, is more efficacious than a singleform of nicotine replacement. Patients shouldbe encouraged to use combined treatments ifthey are unable to quit using a single method. AlcoholAlcohol abuse and alcoholism are under-recognized pr oblems in the elderly population. One third of older alcoholic persons have devel-oped alcoholism in later life; the other twothirds of the population will grow older with themedical and psychosocial sequelae of early-onsetalcoholism. Sixty-two percent of community-dwelling adults ages 60 to 94 were found todrink alcohol (Mirand & Welte, 1996).

Motivational information has the greatest impact if it is relevant to apatient's disease status or risk, family or social situation (e.g., having children in thehome), health concerns, age, gender, and other important patient characteristics (e.g.,prior quitting experience, personal barriers to cessation). Risks The clinician should ask the patient to identify potential negative consequences oftobacco use; the clinician may suggest and highlight those that seem to be the mostrelevant to the patient. The clinician should emphasize that smoking low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes or use of other forms of tobacco (e.g., smokeless tobacco, cigars, and pipes) will not eliminate these risks. Examples of risks are: Acute risks \u2014Shortness of breath, exacerbation of asthma, harm to pregnancy, impo- tence, infertility, increased serum carbon monoxide Long-term risks \u2014Heart attacks and strokes, lung and other cancers (larynx, oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, cervix), chronic obstructive pulmonarydiseases (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), long-term disability and need forextended care Environmental risks \u2014Increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease in spouses; higher rates of smoking by children of tobacco users; increased risk for low birth weight,SIDS, asthma, middle ear disease, and respiratory infections in children of smokers Rewards The clinician should ask the patient to identify potential benefits of stopping tobaccouse. The clinician may suggest and highlight those that seem to be the most relevant tothe patient. Examples of rewards include the following: Improved health Food will taste better Improved sense of smell Save money Feel better about yourself Home, car, clothing, breath will smell better Can stop worrying about quitting Set a good example for kids Have healthier babies and children Not worry about exposing others to smoke Feel better physically Perform better in physical activities Reduced wrinkling/aging of skin Roadblocks The clinician should ask the patient to identify barriers or impediments to quitting andnote elements of treatment (i.e., problem solving, pharmacotherapy) that could addressbarriers. Typical barriers might include: 28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 716 Active Aging 717 \"moderate\" alcohol use in individuals over theage of 65 (O'Connor & Schottenfeld, 1998). Published health benefits of regular light-to- moderate alcohol consumption include lowermyocardial infarction rates, reduced heart fail-ure rates, reduced risk of ischemic stroke, lowerrisk for dementia, decreased risk of diabetes, andreduced risk of osteoporosis. Numerous com-plementary biochemical changes have beenidentified that explain the beneficial effects ofmoderate alcohol consumption. Heavy alcoholconsumption, however, can negatively affectneurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hemato-logic, immune, psychiatric, and musculoskele-tal organ systems (Rigler, 2000). Binge drinking is a significant problem even among moderate drinkers and is associated withparticularly high social and economic costs. Theelderly are also commonly prescribed an averageof 7-8 medications, many of which are nega-tively affected by alcohol. A cautious approachshould be emphasized for those individuals whodrink even small amounts of alcohol. Manyelderly are taking antianxiety drugs such asValium and Xanax that can be potentiated bythe use of alcohol. Also, the regular use of alco-hol should be discouraged in those individualswith depressive illnesses where alcohol taken incombination with other drugs as common asTylenol may contribute to a suicide attempt. An American Heart Association (AHA) posi- tion statement cautions that if you drink alcohol,do so in moderation. Moderation is consideredan average of one to two drinks per day for menand one drink per day for women. They furthercaution people notto start drinking, and to con- sult their doctor on the benefits and risks ofconsuming alcohol in moderation (AHA, 2002). The popularity of the topic of the health ben- efits of moderate alcohol intake in both medicaljournals and the lay press gives rise to increaseddiscussion of the subject. A recent column by apopular wine journalist reported on medicalstudies that moderate drinking can help preventstrokes, amputated limbs, and dementia.

He quoted Abigail Zuger'sNew York Times article titled, \"The Case for Drinking,\" which describes the growing bodyof evidence that people who consume wine inmoderation tend to be healthier and live longer(Zuger, 2002). He further decried the politicalcorrectness of institutions and authorities thatat worst cover up the results of the Framinghamstudy and at best are too timid to go so far as torecommend wine in moderation. He concludesby advising his readers to discuss the topic withtheir family physicians (Garr, 2003). Individuals who are currently abstinent and comfortable with that lifestyle should not beencouraged to start drinking solely for thepotential health benefits. Although convincingdata do not currently exist, the risks of devel-oping abusive drinking patterns and the asso-ciated detrimental health effects potentiallyoutweigh the advantage of light to moderatedrinking (Cherpitel et al., 1995; Dawson,2001). Exceptions to this conservative stancemay be considered for the patient who is 1) wellknown to the physician, 2) has no apparentabuse liability, and 3) has cardiovascular risksthat demand aggressive intervention and is onno medications that prohibit alcohol use. Forthose choosing to initiate alcohol consumption,a conservative prescription-like recommenda-tion of a precise amount at a given time (e.g.,one glass of red wine with the evening meal)would seem indicated. Careful monitoring forTable 19-4 Pharmacotherapy for Smoking Cessation (continued) Factor Bupropion SR Patch Gum Inhaler Nasal Spray Caution AvailabilityDo ifyou have al. (2000).

Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life escalating usage and/or adverse health conse-quences is appropriate. For individuals who have established an adaptive and enjoyable pattern of appropriatealcohol use, and have no identified health prob-lems that could be adversely affected by alcoholuse, there appears to be no compelling reason toencourage them to abstain (Rehm, Greenfield,& Rogers, 2001), although continued monitor-ing is indicated. After assessing for contraindi-cations, individuals who do not have a history ofalcohol abuse can be counseled regarding thehealth benefits of light to moderate consump-tion (Ellison, 2002). Although some studiesshow no difference in the beneficial effects ofdifferent forms of alcohol (Gaziano et al., 1999),others have found red wine to be most beneficial(Gr\u00f8nb\u00e6k et al., 2000). Recommendations regarding alcohol intake should be individualized based on age and gen-der as well as physical and mental health status(Drory, 2001). Individuals with medical, psy-chiatric, or pharmacologic contraindications,and those with personal and/or family historiesof substance abuse should be encouraged not todrink at all; however, lower limits may be ap-propriate for those with hypertension or diabetes(Meister, Whelan, & Kava, 2000). Everyoneshould be cautioned regarding the effect of evenmoderate drinking on motor skill activities suchas driving (Drory). The following are four steps for treating alco- holism in the elderly: 1. Identify individuals requiring treatment.2. Determine individuals' readiness to dis- cuss treatment. 3. Assess individuals requiring detoxification.4. Plan for postdetoxification treatment in coordination with other professionals.When assessing the elderly for alcohol use,health care providers should assess for cognitivedecline, nonadherence with appointments, psy-chiatric history, insomnia, poorly controlledhypertension, frequent nutritional deficiencies, delirium dur-ing hospitalization, elevated corpuscular volumeon CBC, and family problems. Cancers of thehead, neck, and esophagus are associated withchronic alcohol abuse. Also, liver cancer is asso-ciated with cirrhosis as a side effect of chronicalcohol abuse. Hospitalization is recommended for detoxifi- cation of those elderly who are dependent on alco-hol. Older individuals with multiple medicalconditions have a decreased reserve and are at riskfor delirium and seizure during withdrawal.Treatment typically consists of benzodiazepines, aswell as thiamine and other vitamin older patients shouldbe directed into elder-specific outpatient therapyfor long-term adherence (Rigler, 2000).Medication AdherenceIn the past few decades, hundreds of researcharticles have been published on nonadherence.Dozens of devices and programs have beendeveloped to assess and resolve adherence-related problems. Yet, despite the tremendousefforts of pharmacists and other health careproviders, medication nonadherence remains amajor public health problem, particularly foraging persons. Indeed, the National Council onPatient Information and Education a variety offorms, including not having a prescriptionfilled; taking an incorrect dose; taking a med-28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 720 Active Aging 721 ication at the wrong time; forgetting to takedoses; or stopping therapy too soon due to thecosts, a logical decision, or side effects unknownto the physician. Medication adherence can beinfluenced by herb use and over-the-countermedications as first choices prior to utilizingprescription drugs. Medication nonadherence is a major public health problem that has been called an \"invisi-ble epidemic\" (Fincham & Wertheimer, 1985;Smith, 1996). Nonadherence to pharmacother-apy has been reported to range from 13% to93%, with an average rate of 40% (Bond &Hussar, 1991). The problem encompasses allages and ethnic groups, but is even more preva-lent in the elderly; it has been estimated that55% of the elderly are nonadherent (Bruce et al.,2004). A host of individual characteristics mayalso influence adherence, such as the patient'sreligion, health beliefs, social support system,and ethnicity. Although a plethora of attributesand variables have been evaluated as predictorsof adherence, the frequency of dose has beenidentified by multiple studies as contributing tononadherence. Rates of nonadherence vary with different dis- ease states. For example, the nonadherence ratefor hypertension is reported to be 40%, whereasthat for arthritis has been found to range between55% and 70% (Task Force for Compliance,1994). Nonadherence rates are especially highamong patients with chronic diseases (Blandfordet al., 1999). These patients, who typically re-quire long-term, if not lifelong, medications tocontrol symptoms and prevent complications,often must make significant behavioral changesto adhere with pharmacotherapy. Such changescan be difficult to integrate into everyday life. Direct and indirect methods of assessing medication adherence can be utilized to identifyelderly people having difficulty in adhering toprescribed regimens. Health care professionalscan monitor blood levels and/or urine assays fordrug metabolites or marker compounds. Indirectmethods of assessing adherence include patientinterviews, pill counts, refill records, medicationorganizers, and measurement of health out-comes. The interview method is inexpensive andallows the health care professional to show con-cern for the patient and provide immediatefeedback. A drawback of this method is that itcan overestimate adherence, and its accuracydepends on the patient's cognitive abilities andthe honesty of his or her replies, as well as theinterviewer's correct interpretation of responses.Pill counts provide an objective measure of thequantity of drug taken over a given time period;however, this method is time-consuming andassumes that medication not in the containerwas consumed. The refill record provides anobjective measure of quantities obtained atgiven intervals, but assumes that the patientobtained the medication only from the recordedsource and assumes the individual actually takesthe pills. Strategies to improve adherence should tar- get the specific risk factors and causes identifiedduring the patient assessment ( Case Study 19-1 ). Adherence aids, such as medication organizers,may be used alone or in combination, butshould be tailored to the individual patient. Forexample, a forgetful patient may benefit from aspecial package or container that provides avisual reminder that a medication was taken (forexample, blister packaging or a computer-aidedcompliance package). Patients should be advisedto take dosages in conjunction with other rou-tine daily activities that are highly habituatedand not likely to be skipped, such as at meal-times or before tooth brushing. Refill reminders28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 721 722 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life Once the initial adherence plan is imple- mented, follow-up is important to gauge howwell the plan is working and whether changesare needed. Therefore, the pharmaceutical careplan must include periodic reinforcement strate-gies for long-term success. The plan should alsobe reevaluated from time to time to assess itseffectiveness and determine how well it meetspatient expectations. Strategies for Enhancing Adherence to Phar- macotherapy. Although care plans should be individualized, some adherence-promotingstrategies tend to be helpful for the majority ofpatients. Whenever possible, health care pro-viders should strive to: Promote self-efficacy: Encourage patients to assume an active role in their own treat-ment plans. In general, the more confi-or automatic delivery to the home also can bevaluable for the forgetful patient, as can simpli-fication of the dosage schedule, such as chang-ing to a once-daily prescription. Cues or prompts,including phone calls, medication diaries, andmedication organizers, are reported to be help-ful across multiple age groups. It is crucial thatthe individual's perception of the environmentand his or her view of the feasibility of the sup-port system or aid, such as a medication organ-izer, be considered. Health care providers shouldplan with the individual, given they know theiradaptive strategies the best as well as what aidsthey are willing to use. Individuals should beencouraged to monitor \"outcome\" variables andmaintain a medication diary instead of takingmedication based on \"perceived symptoms,\"which leads to poor adherence. his medicine into quarters so that themedicine will last longer. Questions: 1. As the nurse, what would be your plan of care for this patient? 2. How would you address his med- ication adherence problem? 3. What resources could help you in providing his care? 4. What underlying causes may be present that explain this patient'sbehavior?Mr. Jai is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension. He comes tothe medical clinic today complaining ofheadaches, tiredness, and fatigue. Upontaking his vital signs, the nurse notes aregular heart rate of 98, B/P 189/92,and normal temperature. In taking hishistory, you ask about the medicationshe is taking. He states that he has pillsfor his blood pressure.

When the nurse askshow he does this, he replies that he cutsCase Study 19-128438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 722 Active Aging 723 dent people feel about their ability tomanage a problem, the more likely theywill be to take positive action to solve thatproblem. Involving patients in decisionsabout their care is important for promot-ing self-efficacy. Empower patients to become informed medica-tion consumers: A medication care plan to enhance adherence should first focus oneducating the patient and family membersor caregivers about the patient's diseaseand medications. Nurses should provideboth written and oral information toaddress such basic questions as: What isthe disease? Which treatments have beenprescribed or recommended and why?What is the patient's role in managing thedisease? Which adverse effects may occur? Avoid strategies that could intimidate: Scaring patients or giving them dire warningsabout the consequences of less-than-perfectadherence can backfire and may actuallyworsen adherence. A more constructiveapproach is to help the patient focus onways to integrate medication-taking intohis or her daily routine. Investigate theindividual's belief about his or hermedications and their perceived values.Help the patient to develop a list of short-termand long-term goals: These goals should be realistic, achievable, and individualized.The health care provider can also make\"contractual\" agreements with the patientto encourage development of constructivebehaviors, such as getting more exercise orbeginning a smoking cessation program. Plan for regular follow-up: The health care provider should plan to interact with thepatient at regular, usually brief intervalsto reinforce the adherence plan. For exam-ple, brief appointments can be scheduledwhen patients visit the pharmacy for pre-scription refills. The plan should beadapted to the patient's lifestyle and bereevaluated from time to time to adjustfor life changes, such as aging or a changein work or school schedules. If possible,the time for counseling on adherenceshould be separated from the dispensingand pick-up functions. Implement a reward system: Giving prescrip- tion coupons or specific product discountsfor successfully reaching a goal in thetreatment plan can help to increase adher-ence, particularly in patients with lowmotivation. Although older Americans (aged 65 and older) account for less than 15% of the popula-tion, they consume about 33% of all prescriptionmedications and 40% of nonprescription drugs(NCPIE, 2004). Poor adherence in the elderlyoften leads to additional physician or emergencydepartment visits, hospitalization, and uncon-trolled chronic diseases. One study estimatedthat about 17% of elderly hospitalizations aredue to adverse medication reactions\u2014nearly sixtimes the rate in the nonelderly population(Nanada, Fanale, & Kronholm, 1990). A variety of interacting risk factors increase the risk of nonadherence among the elderly.Risk factors in this population include: Polypharmacy: Elderly patients are more likely to take multiple medications,including both prescription and nonpre-scription products. Whenever possible,the medication regimen should besimplified. Health care providers alsoshould consider the extent to which the28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 723 724 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life mode of drug delivery (e.g., pill, patch,or inhaler) may influence adherence. Physical impairments: Age-related physi- cal disabilities, such as difficulty get-ting out of bed or a chair, may limit anelderly person's ability to take medica-tion consistently. Traditional packagingof medication also may be an impedi-ment to some elderly patients; for exam-ple, individuals with arthritis in theirhands may have trouble opening con-tainers. For these patients, consideroptions such as unit-of-use packaging,unit-dose packing, or blister packaging. Cognitive limitations: Memory loss and other cognitive problems may interferewith adherence by causing patients tofail to understand or remember medica-tion instructions (Mallet, 1992). Forthese patients, health care providersmay need to provide medicationinstructions several times and in differ-ent formats, such as both verbal andwritten information. Limited access to or affordability of healthcare services: Many elderly patients are on fixed incomes. Elderly patients who areunable to afford certain medicationsmay be eligible for various forms ofstate or federal aid, or special discountsfrom pharmaceutical manufacturers. Low-literacy patients: Patients who read poorly or not at all are at high risk forpoor adherence. According to the U.S.Department of Education HealthLiteracy Survey (Kirsch et al., 1993), 40million people in the United States arefunctionally illiterate and another 55million are only marginally literate.Patients with low literacy skills are lesslikely to be adherent to their medica-tion regimens and appointments, or topresent for care early in the course oftheir disease (Malveaux et al., 1996).Patients with low literacy can be taughtto color code their bottles with coloredtape or to use an organizer that separatesdaily doses into morning, noon,evening, and night. Personal Determinants GeneticsDeterminants related to personal factors refer tothe biological and genetic impact of the agingprocess. The rate of aging and maximum life-span vary among species, and therefore must beat least partly under genetic control (Hekimi &Guarente, 2003; Miller, 2002). Up to 25% ofthe variation in human lifespan is inheritable(Mitchell et al., 2001); the rest is due to envi-ronmental exposures, accidents and injuries, andchance. Very long life, to beyond age 90 years,appears to have an even stronger genetic basis(Perls et al., 2002), which explains why cente-narians and near-centenarians tend to cluster infamilies. At the other extreme, the progeroidsyndromes of accelerated aging and death at anearly age have known genetic causes (Martin,Oshima, Gray, & Poot, 1999). However, many genes that are associated with human lifespan are not \"longevity genes\"per se; for example, mutations in the tumorsuppressor genes BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 areassociated with breast and/or ovarian cancer(King, Marks, & Mandell, 2003). However,these genes are rare among long-living women,accounting for only 5%-10% of breast andovarian cancer cases. Conversely, genes thatreduce the risk of atherosclerosis may be morecommon in centenarians; two such genes mayhave been identified. The first involves a muta-28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 724 Active Aging 725 tion in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein(CETP) gene that leads to larger-sized lipopro-teins and a reduced prevalence of cardiovascu-lar disease (Barzilai et al., 2003). The secondinvolves variations in the gene for microsomaltransfer protein (MTP)\u2014the rate-limiting stepin lipoprotein synthesis (Geesaman et al., 2003).Although such genes may have substantialeffects on longevity, they do not appear to mod-ulate the aging process. In contrast, longevity genes should delay the onset and/or reduce the rate of aging (Pletcher,Khazaeli, & Curtsinger, 2000), perhaps by slow-ing cellular senescence, improving repair mech-anisms, increasing resistance to stresses such asinfection and injury, or lowering metabolic rate.These requirements are consistent with theobservation that children of centenarians havemuch lower rates of diabetes and ischemic heartdisease, and better self-rated health, than doage-matched controls (Terry, Wilcox, McCormick,Lawler, & Perls, 2003). Therefore, these personsinherited from their long-lived parent a longevitygene, or a set of genes, that protects against theseinfirmities. There is evolutionary pressure to select ge- netic mutations that are beneficial throughoutlife and that manifest as extreme longevity. Butwhy should evolution select mutations thatjust increase survival beyond the reproductiveyears? Indeed, the opposite might be true,because evolution should select mutations thatincrease reproductive success even if they haveadverse consequences later in life. A recentstudy (Lahdenpera, Lummaa, Helle, Tremblay,& Russell, \"grandmother effect\" (Hawkes, 2003),in which longer survival after menopauseincreases reproductive fitness among a woman'sdescendants, because she is available to assistin childrearing.Psychological Factors Psychological factors such as intelligence andcognitive capacity are strong predictors of activeaging and longevity (Smits et al., 1999). Duringnormal aging, some cognitive capacities (includ-ing learning speed and memory) naturallydecline with age; however, these losses can becompensated for by gains in wisdom, knowl-edge, and experience. Often, declines in cogni-tive functioning are triggered by disuse (lack ofpractice), illness (such as depression), behavioralfactors (such as the use of alcohol and medica-tions), psychological factors (such as lack ofmotivation, low expectations, and lack of con-fidence), and social factors (such as lonelinessand isolation), rather than aging per se. Otherpsychological factors such as self-efficacy arelinked to personal behavior choices as one agesand in preparation for retirement. Coping stylesdetermine how well people adapt to the transi-tions of aging. A further discussion of such fac-tors appears in Chapter 9. Physical EnvironmentDeterminants Physical environments that are safe can makethe difference between independence anddependence for all individuals, but are of par-ticular importance for older adults. Hazards inthe physical environment can lead to debilitat-ing and painful injuries among older people.Injuries from falls, fires, and traffic collisions arethe most common. Chapters 9 and 12 provideadditional discussions about these issues.Safe HousingSafe, adequate housing and neighborhoods areessential to the well-being of young and old. Forolder people, location, including proximity tofamily members, services, and transportation,28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 725 726 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life can mean the difference between positive socialinteraction and isolation. Building codes need totake the health and safety needs of older peopleinto account. Household hazards that increasethe risk of falling need to be remedied orremoved. Strategies for extending independencein the home include the use of handrails in theshower, monitoring devices, elevated commodeseats, and an environmental survey for risks. There is an increasing trend for older people to live alone\u2014especially unattached older womenwho are mainly widows and are often poor, evenin developed countries. Others may be forced tolive in arrangements that are not of their choice,such as with relatives in already crowded house-holds. The solution to social isolation may bethrough social programs developed at the locallevel for the elderly. Programs on aging havedeveloped alliances with senior centers for facil-itating social interaction. Social EnvironmentDeterminants Social environment determinants include socialsupport, violence and abuse, and education andliteracy. These determinants impact quality oflife in the elderly by influencing their environ-ment positively or negatively.Social SupportSocial support is an important factor in the pro-motion and maintenance of overall long-termhealth by contributing to physical and cognitivefunctioning and supporting engagement withlife (Lange-Collette, 2002). Social support isvery influential not only in relation to healthbehavior, both prevention and treatment, butalso in the way individuals with serious medicalproblems react to and recuperate from variousdiseases (Hurdle, 2001). For example, one studyfound that minority women who had strongersocial networks and support made greater use ofcancer screening methods, mammography, andoccult blood examinations than did womenwith fewer relationships and less social support(Hurdle). Epidemiological data confirm that so-cial support (i.e., strong social networks and highsocial contact) is related to longevity and mor-tality (Frisby & Hoeber, 2002); both are relatedto quality of life. Another study found that older adults who were socially engaged with others and with theircommunities and who used additional informa-tion resources in solving daily problems demon-strated greater cognitive vitality (Fillit et al.,2002). Conversely, social disengagement in cog-nitively intact elders was found to be an inde-pendent risk factor for cognitive decline. Multiplesatisfying social engagement patterns, avoidanceof social isolation, and engagement in continuingcomplex nonoccupational activities appear to sup-port cognitive vitality and be protective againstdementia in late life (Fillit et al.). Moreover, thesefindings suggest that volunteerism and continuedparticipation in the workforce after retirementmay play a role in maintaining cognitive reserveand vitality (Fillit et al.). Seniors who engage in an active lifestyle report an improvement in their social relations(Aranceta et al., 2001). One study found thatsocial function was promoted and maintainedwhen older women on low incomes had accessto community recreation. A program conductedto address this issue focused on improving thehealth of women living below the poverty line,fostered personal and social changes, andinvolved the collaborative efforts of a municipalrecreation department, several community part-ners, a research team, and these women. Several28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 726 Active Aging 727 positive outcomes were achieved, the mostnotable being self-reported improvements inphysical and mental health, increased participa-tion rates, the formation of new communitypartnerships, and municipal recreation policychanges (Frisby & Hoeber, 2002). Social inter-actions, proper nutrition, and physical activityhave been found to help maintain healthy be-haviors and thus promote optimal aging.Violence and AbuseOlder people who are frail or live alone may feelparticularly vulnerable to crimes such as theftand assault. A common form of violence againstolder people is elder abuse committed by fam-ily members and institutionalized caregiverswho are well known to the victims. Elder abuseoccurs in families at all economic levels. It islikely to escalate in societies experiencing eco-nomic upheaval and social disorganization whenoverall crime and exploitation tend to increase.Elder abuse includes physical, sexual, psycho-logical, and financial abuse as well as neglect.Older people themselves perceive abuse asincluding the following societal factors: neglect,violation, and deprivation (WHO/INPEA, 2002).Elder abuse is a violation of human rights and asignificant cause of injury, illness, lost produc-tivity, isolation, and despair. Assessment of elderabuse should be conducted with each homevisit, physician visit, and emergency room visit. Families and health care providers should be taught to not disregard any reports by an elderlyindividual that sound abusive or harmful.Comments such as \"I put on the lights and noone comes\" or \"I called and then finally went tothe bathroom by myself\" indicate that neglectis occurring. Caregivers also need to have respitecare so that they are less likely to become over-whelmed. Also, low levels of neglect, such asinadequate staffing to offer foods and fluids byhand, are common in many licensed facilities.Neglect may also be noted by observing theindividual's body and skin for open areas orbruises.Education and LiteracyLow levels of education and illiteracy are associ-ated with increased risks for disability and deathamong people as they age, as well as higher ratesof unemployment. Education in early life com-bined with opportunities for lifelong learningcan help people develop the skills and confi-dence they need to adapt and stay independentas they grow older. Studies have shown that employment prob- lems of older workers are often rooted in their rel-atively low literacy skills, not in aging per se. Ifpeople are to remain engaged in meaningful andproductive activities as they grow older, there isa need for continuous training in the workplaceand lifelong learning opportunities in the com-munity (Organisation for Economic Co-operationand Development, 1998). Also, patient educationmaterial is needed for illiterate elders. Economic Determinants Income and Social ProtectionActive aging policies need to intersect withbroader schemes to reduce poverty at all ages.Although poor people of all ages face an in-creased risk of ill health and disabilities, olderpeople are particularly vulnerable. In developed countries, older people who need assistance tend to rely on family support,informal service transfers, and personal savings.Social insurance programs in Germany andJapan, discussed in an earlier chapter, may pro-vide protection to all citizens.28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 727 728 Chapter 19: Promoting Quality of Life Social Services Determinants Social services determinants refer to integrated, coordinated, and cost-effective efforts organizedto provide health care. Services should includerespect and dignity for older persons. To pro-mote quality of life for older persons, health sys-tems need to focus on health promotion, diseaseprevention, and equitable access to care. Healthpromotion and preventive strategies need to bedesigned to reduce the risk of disabilities.Health promotion is the process of enablingindividuals to improve their overall health andultimately their quality of life through behaviormanagement. Prevention is focused on strate-gies to delay or prevent diseases. The availabil-ity of these services influences quality of life. As individuals age, their risk for disease in- creases as does the demand for medication usedto treat disease. The affordability of medicationsinfluences their ability to adhere to treatmentinterventions and to delay the progression of thedisease. Services within communities, such asmental health, long-term care, aging programs,and senior-focused organizations, can provideresources that promote the quality of life amongolder persons. Summary The challenges of the population aging are glo-bal, national, and local. Meeting the challengesof improving the quality of life of the elderly willrequire substantive policy reforms in developedcountries and innovative interventions. Promot-ing quality of life is a multidimensional endeavor.Health care professionals must continuously eval-uate programs that can enhance successful activeaging. A higher quality of life and active aging ismore likely to be achieved by the following be-haviors: daily weight-bearing or resistance exer-cise, appropriate nutritional intake, social supportand involvement, participation in medication ad-herence plans, securing safe environments, andactivities that strengthen mental cognitive acu-ity such as conversations, cards, and puzzles. Byfocusing on active aging determinants and strate-gies to increase healthy living, health care pro-viders will aid elders in achieving optimal qualityof life. Personal Reflection 1. Keep a diary for one week identifying all personal choices that indicate you are promot- ing your quality of life. 2. How do you feel about being involved in smoking cessation for older adults? Are there any groups in your area or at the local university in which you could become involved? 3. What is your opinion about the active aging information presented in this chapter? How could it be useful to you personally? Professionally? 4. How does your culture impact your decisions regarding quality of life?28438_CH19_701_734.qxd 6/7/06 11:52 AM Page 728 References 729 Abrams, M. A. (1973). Subjective social indications.

KEY TERMS Adult Learning Theory Baby boomers Cultural diversity Health disparity 735 Health literacy Lifelong learning Third age28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 735 736 Chapter 20: Teaching Older Adults and Their Families The U.S. population is living longer as a result ofadvances in health care, early treatment and diag-nosis of chronic illnesses, technology in diseasemanagement, and improved treatments andhealth care delivery methods. These advancementsin health care have resulted in a life expectancyincrease from 47 years old in 1890 to 77.3 yearsold in 2002 (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention [CDC], 2002). With continued devel-opments in science and health care, the number ofolder adults is expected to grow by 53% in thenext 20 years from 35 million in 2005 to 70 mil-lion in 2025 (AgingStats.gov, 2005). Those 85and older constitute the fastest-growing segmentof older Americans, and their numbers areexpected to triple to close to 10 million by 2025(Agingstats.gov). Educating these older adults presents chal- lenges to health care providers. Currently, adultswho are 65 and older may have been born in the1920s, 30s, or 40s\u2014a time when many childrendid not have the advantage of education, eitherprimary or secondary. On the other hand, thenext generation of older adults, those who areconsidered more affluent, better educated, andhealthier (living longer), will soon be reachingthe age of retirement (Manheimer, 2002). Thisgroup, the baby boomers born between 1946 and 1961, are presenting educators and healthcare providers with specific educational needsthat have not been expressed in previous gener-ations. With the changing demographics of theUnited States, a culturally diverse group, somewith low health literacy skills, will also be reaching retirement years. All of these factorsinfluence how health care providers must refo-cus on issues of education in gerontology andthe impact on outcomes of health care. Nurses in all settings are expected to provide education to patients and families. Health careeducators in industry, community, rural set-tings, colleges, universities, adult day care cen-ters, senior centers, hospices, continuing careretirement centers, and assisted living centers(to name a few) are now expected to provide top-ics of interest not only to the older adult, butalso to adults or other family members in thethird age who are anticipating retirement years. Topics of education may include anything frommanaging chronic diseases to health promotion,second career choices, exercise, retirement issues,employment issues after retirement, financialissues, legal concerns, and quality of life issues.With this in mind, the purpose of this chapteris to 1) discuss adult learning principles relatedto gerontological issues; 2) identify the currentdemographics (related to education) of the olderadult and how these demographics will changeover the next 40 years; 3) describe the use oftechnology in the older adult population andhow this delivery method can be enhanced forbetter utility; 4) explain the needs of olderadults who wish to be lifelong learners; 5) rec-ognize physical, emotional, sensory, and psy-chological barriers that may impair learning; 6) examine the impact of health disparities and cultural diversity issues in the older adult; and 7) identify both current and future implicationsfor health educators of older adult learners. Adult Learning and the Older Adult Historically, formal education and learning wereconsidered of little value for anyone over 50years old. With few people living past the retire-ment age of 65, education was not consideredbeneficial. Learning during this time was con-sidered a selfish, self-centered desire. Working28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 736 Adult Learning and the Older Adult 737 past 65 years old was unwarranted unless finan-cial strains dictated it. Attitudes about learningafter a certain age were gauged by how muchtime was left to live after retirement (Crawford,2005). Changes in adult learning began in the post-World War II era when the GI Bill ofRights resulted in millions of veterans beinggiven the opportunity to attend college, pro-moting the notion that college degrees werenot only for the wealthy, but also for the com-mon citizen (Sheppard, 2002). This generationbegan to change the way adults could learnand introduced the lifelong learning ap- proach that resulted in an educational culturechange. The increased number of educatedadults fostered economic productivity as wellas improved quality of life in older adults(Crawford, 2005). With an increased life expectancy, retirement at age 65 seems to be early in life, with manypeople living 20 or 30 years past this designatedage of retirement. The baby boomers born be-tween 1946 and 1961 account for 80 millionAmericans, many in the workforce. It is pre-dicted that there will be a labor shortage as thebaby boomers start to retire, with many reen-tering the workforce in second career choices.These events will increase the need for educationof older adults (Crawford, 2005). Education forthe older adult will also be encouraged by theincreasing availability of educational offerings,grants and scholarships, and the change in socialnorms where lifelong learning is socially accept-able and used for a variety of reasons includingeducation, socialization, and training for newskills. The education needed for this large num-ber of older adults can be done in formal andinformal settings, including the community,health care facilities, support groups, colleges/universities, online, and long-term care facili-ties. Because lifelong learning and educationhave been correlated with a delay in cognitiveimpairments with aging, their importance isrelevant not only for those reasons mentionedabove, but also to maintain quality of life(Diamond, 2001). Malcolm Knowles's Adult Learning Theory (1984), which is commonly used in teachingadults, has motivation and relevance as two keyconcepts. Using andragogy as a common prin-ciple for adult learners, Adult Learning Theoryapplies certain principles to enhance learningin adults over 18 years old who have completedmandatory public education. Adults expect re-spect, are autonomous and self-directed, aregoal oriented, and need to know that what theyare learning is relevant and practical. They ex-pect to actively participate in learning andbuild on previous life events. Gerogogy in-volves strategies used when teaching olderadults that aim to lead them to higher levels ofempowerment and emancipation (Formosa,2002). Although the needs of the elderly maynot be different than those of adults in otherage groups (Reynolds, 2005), they may chooseto participate in educational activities as a wayto apply knowledge immediately, increase per-sonal satisfaction, and improve socialization(Blacklock, 1985). Differences may also be seenwhen older adults benefit from certain adjust-ments to teaching methodologies that addressimpairments in the cognitive, affective, sen-sory, and psychomotor domains (Reynolds).Adults derive much of their self-identity frompast experiences, and nurses should use thisknowledge when devising teaching strategies.Fear of failure may also be a concern for thisgroup. Older adults may need extra encour-agement to engage in learning activities.28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 737 738 Chapter 20: Teaching Older Adults and Their Families Demographics of Older Adults' Education In the adult 65 years old and over, 72% reporthaving a high school education and 18% report abachelor's degree or more (Agingstats.gov, 2005).These numbers do not give an accurate represen-tation of education among culturally diverseracial groups. Only 52% of black older adults and36% of Hispanic older adults have a high schooleducation compared to 76% of whites and 70%of Asians. The disparity is not as wide for bache-lor's degrees or more, with 19% of whites, 29%of Asians, 10% of blacks, and 6% of Hispanicshaving a higher degree. These statistics indicatethat a large portion of minority older adults mayhave unique teaching and learning needs. The surgeon general has identified health lit- eracy as a major problem in our health care sys-tem, costing up to $73 billion per year (Bass,2005). Low literacy skills are especially promi-nent in the minority and older adult commu-nity. Health literacy has been defined as \"thedegree to which individuals have the capacity toobtain, process, and understand basic healthinformation and services needed to make appro-priate health decisions\" (Institute of Medicine,2004, p. 1). In a recent study of older adults,44% of English-speaking Medicare beneficiar-ies over the age of 65 had inadequate or mar-ginal functional health literacy, compared to76% of Spanish-speaking older adults. A highprevalence of illiteracy existed for those 85 yearsof age and older (Gazmararian et al., 1999). Inanother study, 80% of African Americans 60years and older had an inadequate functionalhealth literacy (Williams et al., 1995). The degree of health literacy may impact knowledge, self-reported health status, hospi-talization, and health costs (Hixon, 2004). Withan increasing number of older adults comingfrom minority populations, it is important toaddress these educational issues to improve theirhealth outcomes. Acknowledging low literacyskills can be embarrassing to patients; educatorswill have to recognize the scope of the problemin their own communities and patient popula-tions and develop culturally sensitive strategiesto assist in improving knowledge and enhanc-ing health outcomes. Signs of low literacy skillsinclude noncompliance, incomplete forms, sur-rogate readers, and vision/hearing problems(Schloman, 2004). Ethical issues include lack ofrespect for autonomy, potential for harm, allo-cation of health care resources, and informedconsent, to name a few (Erlen, 2004). The chal-lenge remains for health care providers to learnhow to address these issues and narrow this gap. Baby boomers will be more affluent, better educated, and healthier when they reach the ageof retirement (Manheimer, 2002). Prior educa-tion remains a determinant of demand for edu-cation in later years, so a continued increase ineducational demands is predicted for this agegroup (Snyder, Hoffman, & Geddes, 1997). Needs of Older AdultsWho Wish to Be Lifelong Learners Older adults can continue to learn in a varietyof settings. More recently, attitudes about aginghave changed positively due to the fact thatthere is an increasing number of third age el-ders, or baby boomers, who see aging not as atime of retirement and withdrawal, but as atime in which quality-of-life issues are a prior-ity. This is guiding many groups to conductpreretirement education to assist in the transi-tion to retirement. Although older adults still28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 738 Technology for Older Adults' Lifelong Learning 739 expect the traditional retirement, 69% plan towork postretirement in positions related toteaching, office support, crafts, retail sales, orhealth care (American Association of Retiredpersons [AARP], 2003). Despite the trends thatsupport postretirement employment, 67% haveconcerns that age discrimination will be a majorbarrier in the workplace. If the predicted per-centage of baby boomers seek postretirementcareers, there will be an increased demand forcontinuing education. Older learners prefer teaching methods that are easy to access and require small investmentsof time and money. They expect learning tobegin immediately through direct hands-onexperiences. Reading materials such as newspa-pers, magazines, books, and journals are used by64% of older adults for learning. The mostrequested educational topics are listed in Table 20-1 (AARP , 2000).Many colleges and universities offer tuition- free enrollment in regular courses for olderadults. Educational programs are often offeredat no charge through alumni organizations,health care facilities, banks, investment compa-nies, museums, labor organizations, recreationcenters, and the Internet. Industries are offeringworkforce-related education and training. In ad-dition, a variety of educational programs areoffered for the older adult through nationalagencies (see Table 20-2 ). Technology for Older Adults' Lifelong Learning According to the 2001 Pew Internet Survey onolder adults and use of the Internet, 22% ofadults 65 and older have used online services(Fox, 2004). The fastest growing group of peoplelearning to use the Internet is those 55 and older.This may be a common method of learning in thenear future (Adler, 2002). Of those over 70, 14%said they used the public library for Internetaccess compared to only 1% for those under 70.Partnering with learners has been shown toimprove older adults' learning performance withcomputers (Zandri & Charness, 1989). Older adults should have the same opportu- nities to use information technology, despite thecost and disparity seen in this group (Withnall,2002). The process of aging may present chal-lenges to older adults ( Case Study 20-1 ) who wish to use computers to enhance learning. Someof the problems can be overcome with adjust-ments to computer technology (see Table 20-3 ) (Bean & Lavin, 2003). As the baby boomers enter the 65 and older age group, these statistics will obviously changebecause of their comfort with technology. Priorexperience in the use of computers affects attitudesTable 20-1 Educational Topics on Desired Skills Diet and nutritionExercise fitnessWeight controlStress managementComplementary and math, drivingHobbiesCommunity involvementVolunteeringArts and culture or personal enrichmentEnjoyment out of lifeEducational travelSpiritual and personal growth 2000.28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 739 740 Chapter 20: Teaching Older Adults and Their Families and outcomes of subsequent training, so the learn-ing needs of the computer literate will changeover time (Dyck & Smither, 1994). Telemedicineservices are another promising option to educateseniors in distant areas (Adler, 2002). Seniors can often learn about the computer at public libraries and learning centers thatprovide access for computer use and education(Box 20-1 ). Many health care agencies have developed their own Web pages to adapt education forolder adult viewers. When developing a Webpage for older adults, consider the normalchanges of aging and the learning level of theaudience. Many Web pages bridge the gaps ofhealth information disparity by offering infor-mation in a variety of languages (VanBiervliet &Edwards-Schafer, 2004). Usability issues relatedto the older adult include design, font size, col-ors, and clear instructions. Navigation tasks andthe format of the Web page may challenge cog-nitively impaired persons.

Applica-death, Connie was feeling isolated anddecided to go back to the university andcontinue her learning. She found a cohortof older adults who were also interestedin continuing their education in a varietyof ways. At this time, Connie was enjoy-ing art and took a class in art history,something she had always wanted tolearn more about. Taking this class wasnot hindered by her hearing loss. She vis-ited art galleries and was involved ingroup discussions that were run by theclass participants. As an older adult,Connie was engaged in a variety of learn-ing experiences that changed over timedue to circumstances in her life.Questions: 1. How has Connie incorporated lifelong learning in the last coupleof years? 2. How has she adapted to the chal- lenges she has faced to overcomebarriers and continue her lifelonglearning? 3. As an educator, what might you recommend to Connie to enhanceher education or lifelong learningneeds?Connie was 70 years old. She always wanted to learn how to speak Spanishand enrolled in the local college, despitethe fact that she was beginning to havesome hearing problems. She was enjoy-ing her classes as she continued herresponsibilities in her home, includingcaring for her husband who had hyper-tension. Unfortunately, her husband suf-fered from a brain attack (stroke) andConnie had to assume the responsibilityof primary caregiver for her husband,causing her to withdraw from the uni-versity. She did purchase some audiovi-suals to help her practice her Spanish.When her husband recovered from hisbrain attack, Connie was able to reenrollat the university; however, her hearingloss had become worse over time, whichmade it difficult to continue learning alanguage in class. Connie decided to con-tinue using books and tapes to learnSpanish, but she also had a new interestin plants and used educational programson television to learn more about horti-culture and working in her yard. These activities provided Connie with educational activities in the home whilecontinuing to care for her husband, whodied 3 years later. After her husband's Case Study 20-128438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 741 742 Chapter 20: Teaching Older Adults and Their Families tion of these principles can be seen at http://nihseniorhealth.gov. Barriers to Older Adults' Learning Many adults have unique physical or cognitivedifficulties related to learning (Eun-Shim et al.,2004). In 1997, more than half of the older pop-ulation (54.5%) reported having at least onedisability of some type (physical or nonphysical)(Administration on Aging [AoA], 2002). Themost frequently occurring conditions reportedper 100 elderly persons were: arthritis (49),hypertension (36), hearing impairments (30),heart disease (27), cataracts (17), orthopedic im-pairments (18), sinusitis (12), and diabetes (10).The percentage of persons with disabilitiesincreases sharply with age. Disability takes amuch heavier toll on the very old. Almost threefourths (73.6%) of those aged 80 /H11001report at least one disability. Presence of a severe disa-bility is associated with lower income levels and educational attainment (AoA). In order tofacilitate learning and overcome obstacles thatchronic conditions may cause, health careproviders must have insight into the challengesTable 20-3 Problems That Can Be Overcome by Older Adults Using Computers Age Change Effect on Computer Use Possible Solutions HearingVisionMotor control,tremorsArthritisAttention spanSound from computer may not beheardVision declines, need for bifocalglasses, viewing monitor may be diffi-cult, problems with glaucoma andlight/colorsMay affect use of keyboard or controlof mouse, may not be able to hold themouse and consistently click on cor-rect mouse buttonsMay not be able to hold the mouseand consistently click on correctmouse buttonsProblems with inability to focus andmaking correct inferencesUse earphones to enhance hearing andeliminate background noise.Speak slowly and clearly.Adjust monitor's tilt to eliminateglare.Change size of font to 14.

Physicalchanges that can affect learning are listed inTable 20-4 . Specific barriers to education may include cognitive, affective, sensory, and psychomotorbarriers. Cognitive barriers may include illnesseslike dementia and organic brain syndrome.These patients will require courses built uponprevious knowledge, and information should bepresented in short sessions\u2014no more than 3-5points per session. A consistent use of terminol-ogy with repetition will also help reinforcememory. Affective disorders may include de-pression and mood disorders. Sensory barriersinclude hearing loss, glaucoma, and cataracts.Psychomotor barriers may include chronic ill-nesses like Parkinson's, brain attack, arthritis,and pulmonary diseases that impact the use ofteaching tools or computers.Box 20-1 Research Highlight Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a goal-oriented training approach to teach- ing older adults how to use computers. Methods: One hundred and six computer novices were randomly assigned to either the goal-oriented training approach group or the more traditional verbal persuasion-approachgroup. The ages of the participants ranged from 50-89 years. The goal-oriented groupincluded both verbal persuasion and goal setting with brief individual instruction givenby the researcher, and setting goals for certain numbers of spreadsheets to be accuratelycompleted at times during the training. Findings: The goal-oriented training approach group showed stronger benefits related to computer task proficiency and feelings of computer attitudes/efficacy. Individual differ-ences among participants did not account for significant variation in the outcomes. Conclusion: The motivational aspects of the training approach should be more of a focus of training when working with older adults. Older adults may learn more efficiently whengoal-setting is incorporated into the learning process, at least in relationship to learningunfamiliar computer skills. Source: Hollis-Sawyer, L.

Table 20-4 Physical Changes in the Older Adult That Can Affect Learning Reduced vision Reduced hearing Impaired cognitive function Depression Stress Chronic illnesses28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 743 744 Chapter 20: Teaching Older Adults and Their Families Cultural Diversity andHealth Disparities Among Older Adults The issues of cultural diversity and health dispar-ities cannot be ignored when considering educa-tional issues for older adults. Diversity in terms ofage, race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomicstatus are important factors to consider. By 2050,more than one third of the elderly population willbe composed of blacks (12%), Hispanics (18%),Asians (8%), and all other races alone or in com-bination (3%) (AgingStats.gov, 2005). Of note isthat the proportion of Hispanic individuals age 65or older is expected to triple from current popu-lation levels. These shifts in the diversity of theolder population suggest that there may be socialand economic issues related to disadvantagedgroups that deserve special attention. There aregreater disparities in health care delivery and ac-cess to care in later life among diverse groups. Cultural and racial influences will dictate how and what older adults from minority groups willwant to learn (Volland & Berkman, 2004). Ofgreat concern is that many minority elderly do notuse English as a first language. With this in mind,many educational Web pages now are offered in avariety of languages. Nurses should educate them-selves about the literacy and education levels of allelders in the community in which they serve. Implications forGerontological Educators Education must meet the needs of the olderadult\u2014which may change over the next severaldecades. The older adult cohort is not a homoge-neous group, but is composed of persons of differ-ent cultures, races, education, and socioeconomicstatus, all factors that can impact learning. A rap-idly growing pool of competent, college-educatedadults will soon reach their retirement years. Thesetimes will be an exciting period for lifelong learn-ing, which is now viewed as helping older adultsimprove quality of life and add meaning and cre-ativity to their retirement years (Timmermann,2003). These needs may also include learning newlife skills to manage chronic illnesses (due toincreasing longevity), issues related to retirement,health promotion, financial issues, and quality-of-life issues. Educators must address the diverse cul-tures and needs of these groups. Education of older adults must be flexible\u2014 teaching in a variety of settings with a variety ofdelivery methods, including one-on-one instruc-tion, 20-2 ). Working in groups, group discussion, role-playing, and using case studiesor simulations may provide methods of engag-ing older adults in learning. When conductingeducational courses, the atmosphere should beconducive to the older adult, including a com-fortable temperature, frequent breaks, lack ofnoise, and accessible bathroom facilities. In one-on-one teaching sessions with older adults, the nurse should remember to apply theprinciples of adult learning discussed earlier.Establish a rapport with the person. Ask questionsabout his or her background so that teaching candraw from the learner's past experiences. Olderadults need to have a motivation to learn, so becertain to explain the purpose of your educationalsession at the beginning. Scheduling teachingtime in advance with clear explanations of whatwill be taught will allow the learner time to men-tally prepare and formulate possible questions. Many times gerontological nurses will pre- sent to a group of older adults. As previouslystated, this may occur in a variety of settings28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 744 including senior centers, independent living,assisted living, churches, support groups, andother social gatherings. Several steps should betaken to assure that the listeners will get themost possible out of the discussion. These appearin Table 20-5 . Advance preparation is needed to ensure that the program presentation and envi-ronment are focused on the older adult audience.Involving learners in the educational process is agood beginning to encouraging participation. Additionally, remembering to adapt the topic and the ways in which it is presented to accom-modate the physical changes and needs of olderadults will result in much better outcomes.Advance preparation is key to any productivetalk, workshop, or seminar for the elderly. Besure to consider the physical changes associatedwith aging by using a microphone, avoidingglare from lights or windows, and speakingdirectly to the audience to enhance hearing andcomprehension. Table 20-6 summarizes tips for teaching older adults. There is currently a gap in organizational lead- ership in older adult education (Manheimer,2002). There had been no political activism atstate or national levels to support educational pro-grams for older adults. Little research on educa-tion of older adults, including benefits, costefficiency, and improvement of quality of life, hasbeen conducted. Specifically, benefits includingsustaining cognitive functioning have been largelyignored. An increase in desire for postretirementemployment will drive the educational market,and the baby boomers will demand better, moreorganized education that fits their needs. Nurseswho are entering the workforce for the first timeneed to prepare themselves to meet the uniqueeducational needs of this diverse older group.Implications for Gerontological Educators 745 Figure 20-1 One-to-one instruction as well as involvement of family members are educational strategies for older adults.

Visit the location/facility ahead of time and locate the room where you will speak.2. Talk to the director of the facility to get a sense of what topics would be most valuable to the audience. 3. Talk to older adults at the site when you make a preparatory visit. Ask their opinions about what topics they would like more information on from a geriatric nurse. 4. Arrange the date and time of the presentation several months in advance so the facility can give seniors adequate notice. 5. Be sure that the date and time do not conflict with regularly planned activities such as Bingo, mealtime, or exercise groups. Try to plan the time around a standing function such as right afterdinner (if family members are invited) or right before lunch. 6. Find out how the facility plans to advertise your program. Good suggestions include flyers, community letters, newspapers, announcements at group meetings, signs, and posters. 7. Prepare the material to be presented well in advance. Plan to provide handouts and use multiple audiovisual aids that are elder-friendly. 8. For the educational program itself, employ strategies for teaching older adults (see Table 20-6).9. Be flexible. Allow plenty of time for participants to gather. Realize that the program may not start exactly on time if the audience needs more time to get settled. 10. Build in time for questions, answers, and the opportunity for older adults to share their stories.

Assess readiness to learn.Involve the audience at the start with questions or stories to which they can relate.Draw the participants into the material from the beginning.Provide reasons for them to learn by pointing out the significance of the topic using statistics and research. Use multiple teaching modalities to keep the material interesting and maintain attention. PowerPoint slidesVideos or CDsHandoutsBrochures or pamphletsPostersDemonstration/equipmentQuizzes Remember to accommodate any unique physical needs of older adults. Do not stand in front of a window\u2014avoid glare.Speak loudly and slowly. Use a microphone if needed. Turn off fans and other distracting noise.Face the audience (remember that elders often fill in what they cannot hear by lip-reading).Limit programs to about 20-40 minutes.Use a room that is large enough to accommodate persons with wheelchairs, walkers, and other adaptive devices. Handouts should be in a large font and in black type on white paper for easy readability.Keep slides uncluttered; don't provide too much information. Use a large font with an easy-to-see background for slides. Control the environment. Arrange the room to best suit the particular presentation. Be sure the room is large enough for the expected number of attendees. Have a helper to assist with seating late-comers without disrupting the program or to help those who must leave during the presentation for some reason. Be sure the room is a neutral temperature\u2014not too hot nor cold, and free from drafts. Make presentations elder-friendly. Choose topics of interest to older adults such as living wills, vitamins and minerals, and stroke prevention. Create a catchy title for the presentation that will pique interest and curiosity.Use lay terms or explain any confusing medical jargon. Define all terms.Invite special speakers who are well known in the area to promote attendance.Offer prizes, gifts, or some type of take-home item. Be sure that handouts are appropriate to the literacy level and cultural background of the group.28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 747 748 Chapter 20: Teaching Older Adults and Their Families Critical Thinking Exercises 1. You have been approached by the director of nursing at a long-term care facility to present an educational program on a \"topic of interest\" to an expected group of about 10 older adultsin assisted living. What topics of interest would you consider? How would you prepare forthis presentation? What teaching modalities would you use? How would you adapt the envi-ronment to enhance learning for this group? Who would handle advertising of this program? 2. You are a new instructor at a small community college. You have been assigned to develop a service-learning project for an aging class in which the senior BSN studentsmust develop and present a teaching project in local nursing homes. There are 60 stu-dents in the class and five facilities available over a 4-month period. How will you dividestudents into groups and facilities? Would you allow students to choose their own top-ics, make a list of suggestions, or set this up ahead of time with each facility? What influ-enced your decision to choose one approach over another for setting up these experiences?How will you evaluate the students' presentations? Is this project reasonable for seniorBSN students to undertake? What background and instructions would students needto be successful on this project? 3. On the medical-surgical floor of the hospital where you work as a graduate nurse, the charge nurse asks you to do some one-on-one teaching with a 78-year-old widower who must learnto give himself insulin injections for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. How long do youthink it will take for this patient to learn such a skill? What are the factors you would needto assess prior to beginning your instruction? What strategies will you use to prepare forthis teaching session? What tools or teaching aids would be appropriate? Personal Reflection 1. Have you ever cared for an older adult who did not speak English or for whom English was a second language? How did you feel when you tried to explain something to himor her? Did it make you feel frustrated? Did you give up? How was this person's overallhealth status? How did he or she cope with illness? What could you have done differ-ently to achieve a better long-term health outcome? 2. How do you employ teaching of older adults in your daily nursing care? How important to you is the role of teacher among the nurse's many roles? Have you ever considered acareer in gerontological education? If so, how do you visualize yourself 10 years from nowin such a position? What type of setting would you most like to work in if your pri-mary job was education relating to older adults?28438_CH20_735_750.qxd 6/6/06 5:25 PM Page 748 References 749 Glossary References Adler, R.

Exciting breakthroughs in patient careoccur daily, and with those come greater respon-sibilities for professional nurses. Nurse managers and leaders have addi- tional challenges in caring for older adults withcomplex needs. As the number of elderly per-sons in the population increases, so will thenumber of caregivers who will need to be man-aged. Nurse leaders in gerontology \"must beable to lead at the bedside, in clinical teams, andin management teams\" (Mancino, 2005, p.117). All geriatric nurses, whether they hold aformal manager position or not, need to developgood management skills. In this chapter, the gerontological nurse as manager and the skills required for effectiveleadership will be discussed. Characteristics ofsuccessful managers and leaders, as well as theconcepts of assertiveness and delegation, willalso be presented. Nursing is \"the caring and nurturing of the physical, social, spiritual, cultural, and emo-tional wellbeing of an individual, family andcommunity\" (DeYoung, 1981, p. 34). Althoughthe primary aim of gerontological nurse man-agers is to promote quality of patient care, thisgoal is accomplished more through faciliation inmanagement than with bedside nursing. Nursemanagers in settings involving older adultsshould focus on implementing, and assistingothers to implement, best practices. Althoughthis may seem obvious, education of health pro-fessionals and subsequent translation into prac-tice in care of older adults continues to demandattention. As one expert stated, \"the infusion ofknowledge as to how to create a safer hospitalenvironment for older people has been slow totake hold\" (Regenstreif, 1999, p. viii). When nurses move from a direct care posi- tion into management, their focus on patientcare shifts to the quality, education, and expe-rience of the staff they supervise, empoweringothers that provide the hands-on care to pa-tients. Thus, the gerontological nurse manageris in a unique position to improve the quality,positive outcomes, and cost-effectiveness ofpatient care in a variety of settings. The Nurse Manager The University of Iowa defines the nurse man-ager's basic function and responsibility in thisway: The nurse manager provides clinical and managerial leadership to assure that all staffcan identify the customers they serve; understandthe aim of the work to serve those customers; andhas the education, methods and resources toaccomplish their performance objectives. Nursemanagers develop and direct the planning,implementation, and evaluation of clinical andnursing services within area of responsibility.The area of responsibility might includeclinic(s), unit(s), service(s), center(s) and/orprogram(s). (University of Iowa, 2005)Nurse managers are specialists who under- take a multitude of tasks, dealing with others ona daily basis. Nursing care, patient and familysatisfaction, staff retention, commitment, andcontentment all hold the key to success for thestaff involved and for the manager. Job satisfac-tion produces good nursing care and eventuallyleads to good public relations and companyexpansion. Nurse managers have a responsibil-28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 754 The Nurse Manager 755 ity to put methods of satisfaction into place.Weeks (2003) provided an example of the stepsused on one unit to attain better patient satis-faction (see Box 21-1 ). With the restructuring of many health care sys- tems, nurse managers have had to accept moreresponsibilities that have extended over broaderareas. Health care is an ongoing process of learn-ing and putting into practice what is learned.Through trial and error, many nurse managershave forged new territory in the areas of adminis-tration and health care. Being a competent nursemanager requires the ability to prioritize, orga-nization skills, and consistency in decisions andtreatment of others. The dual degrees of MSN/MBA or MSN/JD being offered at many univer-sities bear witness to the fact that not only arenurse leaders in greater demand, but also theexpectations for education are increasingly higher. Nurse managers contribute to strategic plan- ning of current and future goals of the work-place, whether in regards to a specific unit or thecompany in general. Management directionneeds to be reasonable and nonthreatening.Being a competent nurse manager requires pri-oritizing, organization, and consistency in deci-sions and treatment of others. Sharing in program development regarding the changing needs of the organization is im-portant to meeting the goals of the facility orcompany.

Several of these quali-ties will be discussed here.OptimismAn important goal of a nurse manager is to pro-vide a professional, positive atmosphere withinthe workplace. This includes leading by example.Encouraging a positive attitude among othersand modeling it outwardly in word and actionsinvolves constant self-direction of the nurse man-ager's own thoughts and attitudes. Demonstrat-ing a consistent and upbeat disposition even instressful situations is essential. Exhibiting a pro-fessional attitude and disposition takes time,energy, and willingness of spirit and mind. Positive reinforcements and redirection when needed are an important part of the nurse man-ager's job. Staff members who report job sat-isfaction foster a cheerful environment withcontented employees, patients, and families.Behind employee job satisfaction and patientsatisfaction is a good nurse manager who guides,influences, encourages, and leads. ProfessionalismSetting standards of professionalism is an expec-tation. Professionalism encompasses the mannerof appearance, language, and behavior. The waya manager dresses, speaks, and even his or herposture can influence how receptive others willbe to that manager. A manager needs to main-tain an image that displays confidence, compe-tency, and completeness of the manager's role.Nurse managers are responsible for maintainingan ethical standard and setting an expectation ofthe same standard for those whom they super-vise. The nurse manager sets the tone for the unitor division and acts as a role model for others.OrganizationBeing organized, creative, and flexible are nec-essary traits. Every day nurse managers are facedwith many new and complex situations. Thefunction of organizing can be defined as relatingpeople and things to each other in such a waythat they are combined and interrelated into aunit capable of being directed toward organiza-tional objectives (Longest, 1976). Health caredelivery systems work when an interdisciplinaryteam performs a variety of skills in a complexcare environment. Without organization, eventswould likely not be completed in a timely man-ner. Based on the creative, flexible, and organi-zational skills of the nurse manager, those underhis or her supervision will be affected negativelyor positively. If the nurse manager keeps dead-lines and meets staff expectations, then staffmembers will generally view this as a priority. Being organized takes work and determina- tion. Prioritization is essential. Starting each daywith a to do list, ranked by order of importance,will help the manager stay on track. There willbe days when those priorities will change severaltimes. Keep in mind that everything does notneed to be done in one day. Ask \"How can I, asa nurse manager, complete my priorities todayrealistically and completely?\" CreativityCreativity calls for imagination. Keeping staffinvolved and excited about work and changesrequires the use of critical and creative thinking.An initial role for nurse managers is to encour-age the staff to offer their unique ideas and sug-gestions. Creativity is an art and can be fun.Each person has special ideas and individualways to improve workplace conditions. Culti-vating those suggestions is the responsibility ofthe manager. Knowing how the staff perceives28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 756 The Nurse Manager 757 the milieu of the workplace and allowing themto express their ideas may help the manager todraw out some hidden gifts of the staff. Perhapsstaff members would benefit from more inputinto scheduling. Indeed, some long-term carefacilities allow the staff to make their own workschedules within the parameters and staffingneeds set by the manager. Such practices pro-mote a sense of ownership and control withinthe nursing team and increase job satisfaction.FlexibilityDaily dilemmas require flexibility. Many timesa nurse manager's day will not go as planned; forexample, a staff member may call in sick towork, or may have a sick child or car trouble.Those are unexpected situations that require notonly flexibility, but also creativity and the abil-ity to reorganize as needed. To keep quality ofpatient care at its highest level, flexibility willbe necessary. Nurse managers would benefitfrom having a back-up plan to accommodate theunforeseen changes that inevitably happen inthe health care environment.IntegrityIntegrity suggests honesty and trustworthiness,qualities that are evident to others over time.This infers that a person is dependable, punc-tual, fair, and consistent. Patients and familiesrecognize integrity as an important value insociety and certainly in health care. Persons ofintegrity make excellent managers because theyearn the trust of others. The supervisors towhom they answer know that patients will becared for appropriately and safely. Nurse managers should treat all staff mem- bers equally. Staff members look at fairness withhigh regard (Marquis & Huston, 2003). Show-ing favoritism will develop a stressful and di-vided environment. At times, the nurse managermay have to make difficult decisions about staffdiscipline or termination. Some duties of themanager may be unpleasant but necessary.Managers with integrity will take into accountthat each person is special, displays specific indi-vidual skills, and contributes to the overall goalsof the unit. Skills of Nurse Managers Gerontological nurse managers will develop askill set related to accomplishing the goals andobjectives of the particular unit they service.Certain skills, such as those summarized in Box 21-3, will facilitate more positive outcomes. DelegatingOne skill that all nurses need to develop is that ofdelegation . Nurses do not work in isolation, but are dependent upon the smooth communicationand activity of an interdisciplinary team. Chargenurses, nurse managers, nursing supervisors, anddirectors are all called upon daily to make deci-sions about those who help them achieve the Box 21-3 Skills of Nurse Managers Team buildingMaintaining balance in the workplacePrioritizingSetting realistic goalsDelegatingMultitaskingDecision makingExcellent judgmentEmpoweringFacilitating change28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 11:54 AM Page 757 758 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader desired outcomes for patient care. Delegation isone of the primary tools used by geriatric nursemanagers to ensure the quality of patient care. Delegation may be simply defined as giving authority to a specific person for a specific task.Delegation is both a managerial and a legal act,and a skill that must be learned and practiced.It involves more than just handing out patientassignments or duties to be performed. It is notabdication of one's own responsibilities. Li-censed nurses are still accountable for the well-being and safety of the patients entrusted tothem. Thus, when a licensed nurse delegatesduties to unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) , such as nursing assistants or nurse tech- nicians, the licensed nurse is still ultimatelyresponsible for the quality of patient care. Kelly-Heidenthal stated: \"inappropriate use of UAPin performing functions outside their scope ofpractice is a violation of the state nursing prac-tice act and is a threat to patient safety. The RNhas an increased scope of liability when tasks aredelegated to UAP\" (2004, p. 103). The nursecan delegate tasks such as bathing, feeding, andtoileting to qualified and trained UAP . Al-though UAP can give supportive care, they can-not lawfully perform nursing duties such asassessment, treatment, or total patient care. Delegation involves a problem-solving process. Decisions about how and when to delegate dutiesare complex and involve critical thinking skills onthe part of the nurse manager or charge nurse.One study found that the group climate on a unit\"was significantly associated with the head nurse'sability to delegate tasks and to make decisionswith confidence\" (Hern-Underwood, 1991, p. 4).How does one make decisions about delegatingcare or assigning patients? The Delegation Process. Delegating is a process that, much like the nursing process orany other critical thinking process, involves sev-eral steps: assessment, planning, delegation,supervision, and evaluation ( Figure 21-1 ). The first step in the delegation process is assessment. The nurse manager should examinethe situation with which he or she is chargedand gather data. This involves more than justlooking at a standard acuity form. Questionsmust be answered, such as: How many patientsneed to be cared for? What is their level of com-plexity? What nursing hours are required toprovide safe and competent care? Are there anyother factors that will add to the duties that thestaff will need to perform on this shift? Arethere any admissions or discharges? Are any firedrills or other interruptions planned? Does anyextra teaching need to be done with familymembers? Are there any patients whose condi-tion has deteriorated and who might need extranursing time? Remember that geriatric patientsoften present with subtle changes in health sta-tus that may become emergencies quickly if notproperly treated. After assessing the needs of the patients un- der her or his supervision, the nurse must assessthe available staff. Another set of questions mustbe asked. Is the staffing adequate? Are thereenough licensed professionals per patient basedon acuity and other needs assessed? Are theavailable staff members able and competent toperform the assigned skills? How much super-vision will the nursing assistants require? Areany float nurses or assistants assigned to theunit? If so, what is their background and expe-rience? Will the RNs on the unit need to per-form any additional duties for LPNs or nursetechnicians who are working (such as taking andnoting physicians' orders or starting IVs)? Whatis the scope of practice of the LPNs, nursingassistants, or nurse technicians on duty? The28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 758 The Nurse Manager 759 nurse manager must realize that each state andeach facility may have different skills that areacceptable under different job titles. How muchsupervision will the unlicensed staff require? With the answers to these questions in mind, the nurse manager then plans staffing/patientassignments, keeping in mind the five rights ofdelegation ( Box 21-4 ). Planning involves criti- cal thinking in using the assessment data tomake the best decision for quality patient carewith the resources available. Once planning is complete, the nurse man- ager delegates duties to each team member asdetermined by thorough assessment and plan-ning. Instructions and assignments should beclear and in writing to minimize confusionabout job assignments. UAPs should be pro-vided with necessary information about patientsin their care in the form of a brief report. Anyassignments in addition to patient care, such asreplenishing stock or cleaning, should be fairlyand evenly distributed and given in writing.

Any addi-tional information should be communicated inperson during change of shift. Many units taperecord reporting to the next shift to save timeand free additional personnel to cover patientneeds during shift change. Once assignments are delegated, the nurse manager is responsible for supervising bothlicensed personnel and UAP to assure that dutiesare being carried out as expected. Althoughlicensed personnel are responsible for their ownactions or failure to act under their scope of prac-tice, the nurse manager who delegates must beaccountable for the correct performance of thetasks assigned to UAP . Supervision implies mon-itoring and evaluating, making changes or sug-gestions as necessary. The manager must bewilling to adjust assignments as the need arises.Education and training of UAP while under themanager's supervision may be needed. UAPshould feel comfortable enough with their nursemanagers to inform them of any lack of prepa-ration to carry out certain tasks, and of their abil-ity to carry out the delegated assignment. Lastly, the nurse manager evaluates the entire process of delegation (National Council of StateBoards of Nursing, 1995). Evaluate the patient,the person carrying out the task, and how wellit was accomplished. Provide feedback at theend of the shift as to how well quality of carewas accomplished. This may be as informal astelling the staff they did a good job that day, orit may be necessary to do further teaching inareas of weakness where improvement is needed. The delegation process is an important one for nurse managers. Without teamwork, qualityof patient care cannot be accomplished. Dele-gating is one skill that all nurse managers need,and one that can be developed with practice andmentoring. Case Study 21-1 gives an example of the delegation process.Team BuildingGood team building is an essential skill neededby gerontological nurse managers. Caring forolder patients is a multitask endeavor with aninterdisciplinary team contributing to the safedelivery of quality patient care. Team membersmay include many levels of nursing staff as wellas members from other disciplines such as ther-apy, medicine, dietary, social work, housekeep-ing, lab, and pharmacy. In upper managementpositions, nurse managers may have supervisoryauthority for those in other disciplines. Goodteamwork involves contributing, analyzing,criticizing constructively, and accepting a com-mon ground. Working together toward com-mon goals promotes a sense of team solidarity. The gerontological nurse manager promotes team building by enhancing each team mem-ber's skills and abilities, encouraging indi-viduals to use their skills productively andconfidently. Nurse managers need to know thestrengths and weaknesses of each team memberand demonstrate a concern and interest in eachone as a unique individual. To create a motivat-ing climate in the work environment, Marquisand Huston (2003) suggest the following addi-tional strategies: make expectations clear, be fairand consistent, be a firm decision maker, pro-vide experiences that promote employee growth,give positive rewards for desired behavior, andlet employees have as much control and inde-pendence as possible within the limits of theorganization. Creativity, research, and coopera-tion are all needed to foster each team member'sbest contributions to the team. 28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 760 The Nurse Manager 761 Goal SettingA nurse manager sets goals and specific objec-tives to reach them. Goals are set individuallyand also collectively as a team or group. Goalsshould be measurable, realistic, time-limited,and mutually established. In today's society, fa-cilities and companies usually set attainable goalsthat exceed the previous year's goals. Goals arevictory builders. Factors including finances,retention of staff, morale of individuals, re-sources, and desire to achieve may influencegoal attainment. The responsibility of the nursemanager is to set goals and objectives that arerealistic and attainable. Staff nurses should begiven clear directions as to what is required ofthem. Short- and long-term goals should be delin- eated. Short-term goals could be hourly, daily,weekly, or monthly. Long-term goals are moredetailed and may encompass yearly or evenlonger time spans. Realistic goals are easier toaccept and achieve as a team. Goals can be al-tered based on the needs of the nurses or com-pany, and being an effective manager requiressensitivity and flexibility to those needs.Facilitating ChangeNurse managers participate in staff and corpo-rate meetings. Maintaining competency relatedto the current changes within the company andhealth care in general is a requirement for solidmanagement. Implementing change may be ain orientation to the night shift and haslittle experience. What is Ms. Brown's best course of action? If she feels she needs more helpto provide quality care to her patients,whom should she contact? What shouldshe do if told no more help is available?What is the most assertive response inthis situation? How should Ms. Browndivide assignments between herself andthe LPN? Between the CNAs? Is there acertain nursing model of care thatmight work better than another in thissituation? How would Ms. Brown apply the delegation process to this situation?Ms. Brown is the night charge nurse for an inpatient geriatric rehabilitationunit with 30 beds in a small acute carehospital. She is making her night assign-ments and finds that she has herself, oneLPN, and two CNAs to care for 28patients with high acuity. Ms. Browndoes not feel this staffing is adequate, asthe evening charge nurse reported thatone of the patients was receiving ablood transfusion and might need to betransferred to intensive care, and anotherpatient was complaining of atypicalshortness of breath, so tests were beingrun to determine the cause. The LPN isexperienced, but one of the CNAs is still Case Study 21-128438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 761 762 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader challenge. Changes may be instituted based onfeedback from the interdisciplinary team mem-bers. Change can make an individual feel un-comfortable and vulnerable. When comfort zonesare challenged, the nurse manager should pro-vide encouragement, clear direction, and spe-cific expectations. Knowledgeable input aboutpolicies and procedures, staffing needs, andfinancial involvement need to be given on a reg-ular basis. Meetings need to be held to problemsolve, assess where the company is as a whole atthat given time, and assess the needs of staffmembers and patients or clients. For example, a local health care agency may hold corporate meetings weekly. Individual de-partment meetings are generally held once amonth. Department issues are discussed andevaluated and changes are made. Think of thesemeetings like a chain reaction in the follow-ing steps\u2014corporate meetings-departmentmeetings-individual needs. Each is importantand each has specific objectives, but ultimatelythe same goal is in the forefront\u2014to make bet-ter and achieve more. Change in the workplace, whether positive or negative, generally produces stress. Going out-side of the established comfort zone bringsuncomfortable feelings and emotions. Butchange often provides opportunities, which inturn should produce positive outcomes. Howchanges are implemented often determines howthose changes are accepted. Providing cleardirection with any changes will help to reducethe negative responses generally associated withchange. \"The leader/manager must attempt toview change positively and to impart this viewto subordinates\" (Marquis & Huston, 2003, p. 90). The stress resulting from change may beminimized by instituting changes gradually.How would you respond to the situation inCase Study 21-2 ?Stress ManagementThe nurse manager's most difficult responsibil-ities are providing stress management and usingthose skills to manager her or his own stress aswell. Stress has a tendency to filter down fromone person to another. Each individual may per-ceive stress differently with different triggersthat cause them stress. What one person may seeas a negative connotation, another may see aspositive. Attitude and individual behaviorsdetermine how stress is managed. Stress may bedefined as \"any event that places a demand onthe body, mentally or physically\" (Gmelch,1982, p. 5). According to Gmelch in his book Beyond Stress to Effective Management (1982), the Chinese have two different definitions for stress. Two dif-ferent symbols are used in their vocabulary, andthey have completely opposite meanings. Thefirst symbol describes danger, and the secondsymbol describes opportunity. Gerontologicalnurse managers experience both of these chal-lenges in the workplace, but have the responsi-bility to choose which perspective should takepriority. Which will provide the best outcome?Which will provide the greatest learning expe-rience? Which will draw out the positive atti-tudes of staff members? Between these twodescriptors, opportunity provides more imagi-nation and advantage that could produce newskills and attitudes in staff members. The nursemanager must identify actions to develop a res-olution and provide steps to restore energy,calmness, and a spirit of oneness. These stepsenable the nurse manager and staff members tobe ready for the next challenge with eithergreater confidence for resolution or trepidationto face yet another stressful situation. Stress is arealistic part of nursing management, but howstress is approached and defined will eventuallydetermine the outcome of the situation.28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 762 The Nurse Manager 763 Decision Making and Conflict ResolutionNurse managers are expected to make intelli-gent, informed decisions when conflicts arise.Obtaining all of the vital information thatexplains the conflicts helps to avoid blame andjudgment on the part of the manager. Skill isrequired to deal with conflict and decide apeaceful and fair resolution. Approaching prob-lems in a timely manner and with confidencewill assist the staff in realizing that the nursemanager is available and willing to help. Howthe nurse manager resolves conflict reveals char-acter. Nurse \"managers should expect employ-ees to attempt to resolve conflicts amongthemselves\" (Thompson, 2004, p. 64), thoughstaff may require some education in this area.The offer of assistance and the attitude ofapproaching conflicts as important are necessaryfor resolution. The staff needs to have supportand needs to have confidence that the manageris a resource for solving both minor and majorconflicts. Case Study 21-3 provides an example of a situation requiring both decision makingand conflict resolution.ExpertiseNurse managers should have specialized knowl-edge in the area of expertise of the job. This par-ticularly helps in being able to relate to the staffand set realistic goals for quality of patient care.Someone who doesn't have a good perspective ofwhat the staff deals with on a day-to-day basiswill not understand fully how they feel and whypolicy and sees that it threatens morale. What are some practical ways that Ms. Casey can facilitate change to thenew computerized charting system? Canyou think of any incentives that mighthelp the staff be more open to thischange in policy? How might the resist-ance of the nursing staff to this changeaffect morale? Patient care? Devise aplan for how Ms. Casey would be ableto send each of her 44 nurses to attendcomputer class and continue to ade-quately staff her unit. What problemscan you foresee that might arise? Arethere any resources that Ms. Caseycould use to aid in this transition? Ms. Casey, RN, BSN, is the unit man- ager of a geriatric medical floor in a largeacute care hospital. The hospital is intro-ducing a new computerized charting sys-tem that requires the staff to attendtraining to be approved to use it. All ofher 44 staff members are required toattend a 4-hour training class within 1month to prepare for the switch to com-puterized charting. Most of the nursingstaff who have been working on this unitfor years are resistant to the idea of anew charting system and wish to remainon the traditional paper and pencilmeans of charting. Ms. Casey hearsmany complaints about this change in Case Study 21-228438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 763 764 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader they think the way they do. Nurse managerswho have a solid nursing clinical background,which generally includes years of experience indifferent areas of expertise, may more easily earnthe respect of the staff. Respect is difficult toearn if one does not have an equal or more exten-sive background, knowledge, or experience thanthe staff. Gerontological nurses wishing to enterinto management positions may transitionthrough various levels of increasing responsibil-ity. Figures 21-2 and21-3 give examples of various levels of management in different set-tings. The benefit of mastering each consecutivelevel of management and leadership is that thenurse manager can readily identify the needs ofher or his staff members as well as the needs ofthe patients she or he ultimately serves.CommunicationOne of the most important skills for nursemanagers to master is good communication.By definition, communication is the passing ofinformation and understanding from a sender toa receiver. Clearly, this definition does notrestrict the concept to words alone, either writ-ten or spoken. Communication includes allmethods by which meaning is conveyed fromone person to another. Even silence can conveymeaning and must be considered part of com-municating (Twiname & Boyd, 2002). Effectiveand correct communication is vital to meetingthe everyday demands of the job. Communication is often classified as verbal (the spoken or written word) and nonverbal (toneof voice, gestures, body language, inflection, andthe like). Both are important independently andcollectively. Congruence of these two forms ofcommunication is usually displayed throughsimilar words, facial expressions, and body lan-guage. Interpersonal relationships are developedamong health professionals by way of active andhealthy communication. \"Through effectivecommunication, nurses and other well-coordinated, high-qualityhealth care\" (Oermann, 1997, p. 139). NurseWhat is the first step that Mr. Gonzalez should take in resolving thissituation? To which staff members doeshe need to speak? What immediate stepsmust be in place to remedy this situa-tion? If no action is taken by Mr.Gonzalez and the complaints are true,what could happen? Who has responsi-bility in this situation for the quality ofpatient care?Mr. Gonzalez, RN, is the charge nurse on the evening shift of the skilledcare unit at a long-term care facility.The day shift nurses have complainedto Mr. Gonzalez that the evening shiftCNAs have not been showering the res-idents as scheduled. They tell him thatfamily members of the residents havecomplained about poor hygiene of theirloved ones. Case Study 21-328438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 764 The Nurse Manager 765 managers should learn to talk with the staff, notat, about, or to them. Positive interactionsdevelop mutual respect. Pointing out the wrongthings people do or say is easy, but pointing outthose wrong things constructively and withencouragement is the ideal. Case Study 21-3 alsogives an example of a dilemma requiring effec-tive communication between a charge nurse, herstaff, nursing assistants, and patient families. According to Beaufort Longest (1976) in his book Management Practices for the Health Pro- fessional, common barriers exist in communica- tion. Two barriers in particular seem to sum upthe cause for effective or noneffective communi-cation. The first barrier is physical. Physical bar-riers are those things that alter the opportunityfor communication to occur. These could in-clude, but are not limited to, time constraints orphysical environment. Once the physical barri-ers are removed or altered, communication canbe made easier. The second barrier is psycholog-ical, which is a more difficult barrier to over-come. This second barrier takes shape dependingon the perception differences of the people in-volved in the communication relationship. At-titudes and beliefs that are held by the sender orthe receiver can determine the effectiveness andresponse of feedback as well as interpersonal rela-tionships. How one communicates is a reflectionof self-image, which determines the image of thesender and reactions of the receiver. ListeningListening is an active part of communication.Staff members who have bad, unpredictabledays often need a listening ear. Listening is askill that is learned and practiced, and one thathas to be fine-tuned repeatedly. Many assess-Administrator Director of nursing Assistant director of nursing Unit managers Charge nurses Staff nurses Nursing assistants, technicians, QMAs, and other nonlicensed personnelBoard of directorsFigure 21-2 Example of an organizational chart in a long-term care facility.28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 765 766 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader ments can be made just through listening. Thenurse manager needs to provide the individualwith his or her undivided attention and goodeye contact. The nurse manager must look andact interested. If incongruent nonverbals are dis-played, the staff member may feel like the nursemanager doesn't care about his or her needs orpersonal well-being. Taking the uninterested lookand action personally will produce increasedlack of communication. The nurse managermust show outward support to prevent staffmembers from avoiding a future opportunity tocommunicate when the need arises.

Staff nurses and UAP need to be allowed todisplay fears, hopes, and disappointments. Withthe demands of the fast-paced work arena oftoday, managers should be careful to rememberthose who are putting their hearts and minds intohelping others each day. Feelings of being over-worked and underpaid may come to the forefront.Being a nurse takes a tremendous amount oftime, energy, sacrifice, skill, and dedication. Asa nurse manager, it is challenging to turn thesefeelings of being overpowered into feelings ofself-worth and empowerment. Regardless of what type of nurse one chooses to be, one thing remains the same: Nurses arespecialized in health care and the ultimate goalis to enhance the wellness of persons throughspecific knowledge and skills. Despite differ-ences in educational backgrounds, all nurses areimportant in what they do and how they accom-plish the goals set before them. Each should beseen as worthy and with unique contributions tomake to the profession. Inspiring TrustInspiring trust is another management skill. Justas a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship re-quires trust, so does a positive manager-staff rela-tionship. Working together and obtaining open,honest relationships help build trust. Trust takestime to earn. Staff members may need to learn totrust the judgment of the nurse manager. Com-municating needs completely and discreetly, al-lowing room for improvement when errors occur,and practicing positive reinforcements are alltasks needed to build lasting trust. Settings Nurse managers practice in a variety of settings,each of which has descriptions and responsibil-ities related to the specific field of involvement.Gerontological nurse managers are found inacute care hospitals, rehabilitation facilities,nursing homes, assisted living, skilled nursingfacilities, and home care. Within these settings,managers may hold a variety of positions, frommanagement of staff to jobs in case manage-ment, care coordination, quality assurance, edu-cation, or research. In a skilled nursing environment, for exam- ple, the nurse manager is responsible for over-seeing the total care of the patients. Individualsinvolved in the daily care usually include nurses;social workers; physical, occupational, andspeech therapists; nurse's aides; and dieticians.The nurse manager must know how and whyindividual caregivers are involved with thepatient. Working in a skilled facility is chal-lenging, and requires organization, interest, andthe ability to supervise others under the man-ager's jurisdiction. The manager or charge nurseis directly involved in the administration ofmedications, charting, fulfilling doctors' orders,performing daily treatments such as woundcare, making sure the patient partakes in or-dered therapies, and overseeing the aides' ade-quate performance of activities of daily livingsuch as bathing, dressing, and grooming. Nurse managers hold positions of authority regardless of the care setting. Whether acutecare, hospital units, dialysis and rehabilitationcenters, skilled or assisted living centers, orhome care, the nurse manager displays learnedskills and professional qualities, and maintainsgoals. The Nurse Leader Leadership interfaces with management, yet thereare some distinctions between nurse leaders andmanagers. Warren Bennis (1989) conducted a28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 767 768 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader study in which he drew 12 comparison distinc-tions between managers and leaders. Theseappear in Table 21-1 . A leader is a person who holds a position of authority, who influences people, and who hasthe ability to direct and guide others. \"Leadershave the ability to take people to places they'venever gone before . . . successful leaders enrollrather than sell people on their vision\" (Evashwick& Riedel, 2004, p. 3). Effective management requires leadership skills, and effective leadership requires manage-ment skills. A way to determine the differencebetween the two is well stated by AbrahamZalenznik: \"Leaders are inspiring visionarieswho are concerned about substance, while man-agers are planners concerned with process\"(Wikipedia, 2005). Managers are appointed, butleaders arise from within a group.In a survey of 137 women executives, includ- ing nurse executives, researchers found that sixfactors were identified as most important: per-sonal integrity, strategic vision, teambuild-ing/communication, management and technicalcompetency, people skills such as empoweringothers, and candor (Carroll & Jowers, 2002).When compared with female leaders in otherfields, nurse executives were found to value per-sonal integrity highest among all other traits.These results suggest that higher education thatincludes the study of ethics would assist nursesin being more effective leaders. In Britain, the NHS Hospital Trust piloted a new role called Directorate Senior Nurse (DSN),and over a 1-year period engaged a facilitator toguide a small group of DSNs to develop systemsof thinking related to leadership, strategic plan-ning, and service planning and development.The results indicated that DSNs felt animprovement in self-awareness and self-esteemthat led to increased collaboration and creativ-ity within the workplace (Graham & Partlow,2002). Certainly, models such as this suggestthat nurse leaders may be mentored and trainedto be more effective managers and role models. Florence Nightingale provides a good exam- ple of how leadership is developed. Throughtrial and error she was able to establish safe andeffective methods of hygiene to help preventrecurrent death and disease of soldiers. Throughmany hours of study and diligence in helpingothers, Nightingale became a noted leadingforce and developed how nursing issues are dealtwith today. Florence Nightingale embodied thecharacteristics of leadership, but her accom-plishments were not without challenges and dis-appointments. Unexpected outcomes did notstop her from continually trying until successwas reached. Eventually, Nightingale's guide- Table 21-1 Comparisons between Managers and Leaders Managers LeadersAdminister InnovateAsk how and when Ask what and whyFocus on systems Focus on peopleDo things right Do the right thingsMaintain DevelopRely on control Inspire trustShort-term Long-term perspective perspective Accept status quo Challenge status quoHave eye on the Have eye on the horizon bottom line Imitate OriginateClassic \"good Own person soldiers\" A copy The original Source: Bennis, 1989.28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 768 The Nurse Leader 769 lines for hygiene practices, better nutrition, andadequate rest for the ill and injured offered hopeto those in need and began the journey to mod-ern nursing. For nurses who wish to take active leadership roles in organizations or within the profession,additional demands are inherent. \"Nurses whoaspire to formal leadership roles require addi-tional preparation to move into the administra-tive arenas. In addition to the clinical knowledgeand skills, there are business, human resource,organizational behavior, and health care systemissues that must be mastered. Leadership is arewarding and challenging lifelong learningcommitment\" (Mancino, 2005, p. 117). Characteristics of Nurse Leaders What qualities does a leader hold and provideconsistently and openly with others? Effectiveleaders seem to have several qualities in com-mon. Box 21-5 provides a list of these qualities. Leadership Strategies Two types of leadership exist: transactional and transformational . According to a study and Klafehn (1990), \"transactional lead-ers acted as caretakers who had no vision for thefuture and no overtly shared values, while excel-lent nurse leaders had transformational skills andqualities and were perceived to have them bystaff\" (Moiden, 2002, p. 20). Transactional lead-ership involves the rewardand (Moiden, 20). Obviously, trans-formational leadership produces more positiveresults in gerontological nursing settings. According to Marilyn Oermann, based on a study by Bennis and Nanus, transformational leadership involves four major strategies used bysuccessful leaders: \"(1) attention through vision,(2) meaning through communication, (3) trustthrough positioning, and (4) deployment of self\"(Oermann 1997, p. 257). The first strategy enables the leader to see past the present. Based on past experiences,uncertainties, and evaluation of challenges, theleader is able to focus and strive onward towardthe goals established, and look beyond the dif-ficulties that are faced. The leader understandsBox 21-5 Characteristics of Good Leaders Talent and technical/specific skill at the task at hand Initiative and entrepreneurial driveCharismatic inspiration\u2014being liked by others and the ability to leverage thisesteem to motivate others Preoccupation with their role\u2014a dedica- tion that consumes much of their life-service to a cause A clear sense of mission\u2014clear goals\u2014 focus\u2014commitment Results oriented\u2014every action is directed towards a mission\u2014prioritize activitiesso that time is spent where results willbe best achieved Optimism\u2014very few pessimists are leadersRejection of determinism\u2014belief in their ability to make a difference Ability to encourage and nurture those that report to them\u2014delegate in such away as people will grow Source: Wikipedia, 2005.28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 769 770 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader the ever-present changes that exist and usesthem to an advantage. Learning is the tool toattain growth and maturity. The second strategy is based on using good communication techniques to inform and con-vince others of the same vision the leader has.Everyone has his or her own opinions, whichshould be expressed openly and with the respectof others. Leaders use this method to get acrosswhat is expected from others as well as person-ally. Achieving follow-through is much easierwhen others see the leader partake in the taskswith persistence, patience, and excitement.Nurse leaders must reassess when communica-tion is not going well. Keeping focused andkeeping the ultimate visions foremost but bal-anced need to be a priority. The third strategy leaders use is trust through positioning (Oermann, 1997). In thisstrategy leaders stand up for what they believe.People working with that leader know where heor she stands on issues of vision. The leader, onthe other hand, needs to realize the factors thatinfluence vision, whether from staff involvementor environmental factors. The final strategy is called deployment of self. Learning is the key to success. With health carechanges occurring daily, the nurse leader's respon-sibility is to educate herself or himself and others.Leaders do not see failure as the end ( Box 21-6 ). Failure is an opportunity to learn and take what islearned to accomplish visions of growth. Leadersare willing to take risks to accomplish the endresult. Leadership is an opportunity to provide astyle of management that all benefit from. Greatleaders not only possess a great vision with deeproots, but also are possessed by the greater vision. Charismatic style is also involved with trans- formational leadership (Conger & Kanungo,Box 21-6 Research Highlights Aims: To conduct a descriptive study of politicians' and managers' understand-ing of elderly care in Sweden. Theresearchers hypothesized that differ-ences in understanding may impactelder care services. Methods: Researchers conducted inter- views with 8 leading politicians and 12managers in elderly care services.Questions focused on the participants'understanding about caring for olderadults. Findings: Politicians and managers in elderly care had different opinions onhow care for the elderly should bedeveloped and produced. Although awillingness to collaborate betweenpoliticians and managers of elderly carewas found, as were positive attitudestowards care of the aging in various set-tings, ways of understanding care ser-vices lacked clear goals and leadership. Conclusions: The researchers concluded that although it was possible for politi-cians and managers to better collaborateand organize care services for older peo-ple, the views of older persons neededto be included in the process in order togain more positive and practical results.

Leaders can bring unity to othersregardless of turmoil and change. \"Charismaticleaders are characterized by their determinationto change the current state of affairs accompa-nied by an awareness of forces in the environ-ment and their followers' needs\" (Oermann,1997, p. 258). There are three stages of charis- matic leadership involving followers. In the first stage the leader is able to determine theconditions that cause change and recognize fol-lowers who will be able to manage thosechanges. In the second stage the leader encour-ages followers to partake in the vision andrequire clear details, direction, and an attitudeof excitement towards change. The final stageis the ability and desire to go above and beyondwhat is expected to achieve the goals estab-lished. Dedication and continual commitmentis ideal to getting any job done in a timely andeffective manner. Keeping focused requires acontinual reevaluation of the commitment.Good leaders have the desire to stay the courseand finish with satisfaction.Case Study 21-4 presents a thought- provoking situation of challenge to a nurseleader. Leadership Styles Certain leadership styles have been widely rec-ognized, including authoritarian or dictatorial, democratic , laissez-faire , and situational . Authoritarian leadership involves the leader making the decisions with little input from thestaff. This type of leadership rarely works wellin the interdisciplinary care of older adults. Conversely, persons with a democratic leader- ship style welcome the input of staff and generallybelieve that their opinions and vote are important.This is the notion of the majority rules. A laissez-faire leader is much more relaxed and tends to \"go with the flow.\" Although thistype of leadership might work if the employeesare highly motivated and independently able tomeet goals and objectives, it is generally consid-ered not to be the ideal leadership style for mostlong-term nursing situations. One example nursing? Describe the ideal candidatefor this position. What types of experi-ence, background, and education wouldbe expected in this position? Wheredoes the ADON position fall in theorganizational structure of this facility?Where does the DON position fall inthe organizational chart?Mrs. Petty, RN, BSN, is the director of nursing (DON) for the assisted livingportion of a for-profit health care facil-ity.

What qualifications should Mrs. Petty look for in an assistant director ofCase Study 21-428438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 771 772 Chapter 21: The Gerontological Nurse as Manager and Leader where laissez-faire leadership might work tem-porarily is in the case of a faculty or small cor-poration where a few highly skilled individualswork toward a common goal without the needof a designated \"leader\" to motivate and inspire.Such challenges come from the group membersto each other. In contrast to these three styles, a person with a situational leadership style will choose theappropriate type of leadership depending on thesituation. For example, perhaps democracyworks in one situation where a decision does nothave a direct negative impact on patients andallows for flexibility, but in another situationthe leader needs to be more autocratic or dicta-torial because of an immediate change that mustbe made in order to ensure patient safety andcare. A good leader will be able to adjust andadapt to a variety of situations. Positive and Negative Behaviors In addition to the desirable characteristics pre-viously discussed, assertive behaviors are associ-ated with good nurse managers. Assertiveness isto be preferred over nonassertive, aggressive, orintimidating behaviors.Assertive BehaviorLeadership requires assertive behavior. How the nurse leader displays assertiveness will deter-mine how others respond to follow through andsupport. \"Being assertive means being positive,direct, and genuine\" (Twiname & Boyd, 2002,p. 49). Assertiveness is often associated withprogressive and forward behavior. The nurseleader must act reasonably and without judg-ment. The old adage that \"actions speak louderthan words\" may be a true statement. Nurseleaders hold themselves and others responsiblefor actions and reactions. Assertive behavior, asdescribed by James J. Messina and Constance M.Messina, appears in Box 21-7 . Body language is important in assertiveness. Eye contact is one of the first indications thatshow interest and true listening. Stating \"I amtruly interested in what is being said\" beginsthe whole conversation in the right way.Posture, distance, and direct contact are expres-sions used in most conversations. \"Over65-90% of every conversation is interpretedthrough body language. We react more to whatwe think a person meant than to the words thatare said\" (Warfield, 2004, p. 1). Few individu-als know how to read body language. The wordsused and the emphases placed on those wordsproduce different interpretations. The body lan-guage used needs to match the words spoken. Speaking effectively is also an art. Tone of voice is another form of nonverbal communica-tion. Vocal volume should be at a normal con-versational level and without edge, sharpness, orharshness. The ideal posture when exercising assertive- ness is standing or sitting straight at a comfort-able distance from the other person (generally2-4 feet away and outside the other person'spersonal space). Hand gestures are consideredusual in normal conversation. Using relaxed non-direct contact provides for a comfortable con-versation. If physical contact in the form ofappropriate touch is used, soft minimal contactshould be controlled and sensitive. A final language skill in assertiveness is tim- ing. Trying to talk to an individual when bothparties are hurried or stressed will not facilitateproper communication and outcomes.

This al-28438_CH21_751_778.qxd 6/7/06 11:54 AM Page 772 The Nurse Leader 773 lows for no blame to be placed intentionally.Assertive responses are more likely to get indi-viduals to change inappropriate attitudes orbehaviors. Showing healthy and uplifting behav-iors benefits all involved and provides goodinward feelings about self. Good behaviors ulti-mately produce good, helpful outward actions. Assertive behavior is essential in getting a job done in a time frame that may feel threateningdue to the purposes and obligations that havebeen set. Assertive behavior is positive and al-lows the individuals to protect their ideas, moti-vations, and beliefs while at the same time beingable to value and respect the ideas and contribu-tions of others without being threatened. Nonassertive BehaviorNonassertive behavior is a passive demonstration of how one deals with situations. Taking the backseat or withdrawing to the back of the crowd iscommon and more comfortable. People who dis-play nonassertive behavior have a tendency todeny or avoid voicing opinions, thoughts, ordesires regardless of their value. Individuals aremore comfortable allowing others to choose forthem than to take the lead to share opinions,thoughts, or desires. Insufficient confidence, guilt,or fear may prohibit contributing quality ideas,often allowing the nonassertive person to avoidconflict, approach the problems, deal with theissues, and come to a conclusion. Aggressive BehaviorAggressive behavior can be destructive whereas assertive behavior can be constructive. Aggres-sion involves over-reacting emotionally to a sit-uation. Aggression may arise from the fear ofbeing rejected, embarrassed, or condemned. Thistype of behavior is turned inward to produceoutward boasting of self above others. Box 21-7 Examples of Assertive Behavior Standing up for one's rights no matter what the circumstances Correcting the situation when one's rights are being violated Seeking respect and understanding for one's feeling about a particular situationor circumstance Interacting in a mature manner with those found to be offensive, defensive, aggres-sive, hostile, blaming, attacking, orotherwise unreceptive Direct, upfront (not defensive or manipula- tive) behavior; those using assertivebehavior confront problems, disagree-ment, or personal discomforts head on,and their intent is unmistakable to others Verbal \"I\" statements, where individuals tell others how they feel about a situation,circumstance, or the behavior of others Taking the risk of being misunderstood as being aggressive, abrasive, or attacking Being able to protect one's rights while protecting and respecting the rights ofothers Risk-taking behavior that is not ruled by fear of rejection or disapproval but isdirected by the rational belief that \"I deserve to stand up for my rights\" Rational thinking and the self-affirmation of personal worth, respect, and rights A healthy style in which to conduct inter- personal relationships Finding a \"win-win\" solution in handling problems between two individuals Source: Messina & Messina.

The person who is the aggressor also oftenbecomes defensive with his or her actions andbelieves they are right regardless of the cir-cumstances. Aggressive behavior may include,but is not limited to, sarcasm, insulting, blam-ing, threatening, and even name-calling (Messina& Messina, 2005a). Having the power to con-trol is the goal of aggressive behavior. There isno option to allow others to have a voice, nordoes the aggressor care to hear anyone's opin-ions or ideas. Aggression is dangerous and self-centered. Controlling others gives the aggressorthe edge and makes him or her feel important.In aggressive behavior, image is damaged andthe repair can take years to mend, if at all. Thebest approach in dealing with aggressive peo-ple is to provide clear and direct expectationsand provide information that aggressive behav-ior will not be tolerated or encouraged. Puttingpersonal feelings aside while dealing withaggression can be difficult. Personality conflictsdo exist, and a good nurse manager/leader knowshow to set aside those conflicts and look at theentire picture.IntimidationAnother negative behavior is intimidation , which is directly involved with aggression andshould not be encouraged or used as a means toget one's own way. Sometimes other team mem-bers will use intimidation as a tactic to influencea nurse's behavior. Case Study 21-5 gives an ex- ample of one such situation. should make to Dr. Smith?

Barriers are crossed andraised in work relationships. Accusations takehold from both sides and generally feelings arehurt and relationships are strained. Box 21-8 lists tactics that may help the nurse manageridentify those who use intimidation (Messina &Messina, 2005a). Intimidation should never be used by those in authority in the health care setting. If a nursemanager unwisely uses intimidation, the ulti-mate result will be isolation and disconnectionfrom other team members. Feelings of retribu-tion from staff produce uncontrolled anger andnegative outcomes. With intimidation, freechoice is not an option, and it robs others of theability to make correct and beneficial decisionsthat may benefit all involved. Nurse managersmust remember that everyone plays a major rolein the care of patients and the needs of the fam-ilies. Intimidation is not a viable behavior foreffective nurse leaders or managers. Summary In conclusion, both nurse managers and nurseleaders must develop good, safe, and healthyinterpersonal relationships. These relationshipsinvolve individuals in their care, specificallypatients and family members as well as fellowworkers and peers. Cooperation, self-control,and experience are vital to achieving positiveoutcomes. With experience comes confidence,growth in intellect, and stability. Developingthe necessary qualities requires the desire tochange and maintain a constant state of self-reflection. Being a good nurse manager or leaderis an ongoing process that is enhanced by prac-tice and acceptance of constructive criticism,Box 21-8 Tactics Used in Intimidation Threatening to use power or control to manipulate others Using coercion or force Making oneself seem more powerful than one is Emotionally distancing oneself from others to appear more powerful Using verbal and nonverbal cues to scare others into doing a desired behavior Using negative and even abusive verbal and nonverbal behaviors to get peopleto comply with one's wishes Using physical size, stature, and strength to gain respect and obedience Using punishments such as firing and poor evaluations to manipulate thebehavior of others Using quick temper, anger, or rage to get one's way Holding your knowledge, level of educa- tion, or number of degrees over theheads of others to get them to listen Acting in such a way as to discourage questions about one's decisions,opinions, or directives Using money, wealth, or status to hold power over others Ensuring loyalty by threats of withdrawing support, love, caring,interest, or approval of others Using dictatorial behaviors to control othersSource: Adapted from Messina & Messina.

Reality tells us that every person will die. Less than 10% will die suddenly; more than90% will die after prolonged illness (Emanuel,von Gunten, Ferris, 1999). The accumulation ofexperiences throughout a person's lifetime helpsto clearly define the way he or she wishes toexperience his or her own end of life. Familialand cultural factors, along with life events, oftenprovide defining moments that influence a per-son's choices when facing the end of his or herlife and a death that will come sooner ratherthan later. Anthropologist Margaret Mead wasquoted as saying, \"When a person is born werejoice, and when they're married we jubilate,but when they die we try to pretend nothinghappened.\" This chapter deals with the nurse's role in assisting a patient and family to identify theoptions for meeting end-of-life needs. It pro- motes the role of the nurse as a member of ateam of professionals who focus on care andtreatment of issues specific to the elderly as theirhealth declines. It also offers practical assistancefor nurses as they deal with various aspects ofend-of-life care. Historically, education about end-of-life issues and medical needs has been lacking. Initiativesincluding those by Last Acts and those encour-aged by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundationsuch as Education of Physicians in End-of-LifeCare (EPEC), End-of-Life Nursing EducationConsortium (ELNEC), and Center to AdvancePalliative Care (CAPC) are in place to addressthe need for additional information and researchin this area. One of the most demanding roles nurses undertake is that of caring for patients near theend of life. Nurses provide the most direct carefor patients and families, and also help the fam-ily provide care that is competent, comprehen-sive, and compassionate. Therefore, nurses \"musttake the lead in integrating palliative and end-of-life care into the daily practice of every nurse,making it a core competency for all nurses whocare for people with actual or potentially life-limiting illnesses. . . . Nurses mustadvocate for and deliver this quality care\u2014regardless of spe-cialty\" (Rushton, Spencer, & Johanson, 2004, p. 34). Historical AttitudesToward Death and Dying With the advent of ever-increasing moderntechnology, especially following WWII, dyingin the United States underwent a multitude ofchanges. In years past, Americans frequentlylived in multigenerational homes, often in ruralsettings where living and dying experiencesoccurred frequently among the animals. Chil-dren were exposed to life and death issues as amatter of fact, and grew to be adults havingsome experience of death before experiencingthe death of someone close to them. As the abil-ity to cure illnesses and to prolong life devel-28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 780 Historical Attitudes Toward Death and Dying 781 oped, technology took death to the hospital\u2014to the sophistication of machines, antibiotics,chemotherapy, surgery, and such\u2014and away fromthe comforts of home and family. The role of nursing has changed along with the evolution of technology in administeringend-of-life care in this country. For the mostpart, nurses shared the focus toward cure preva-lent in the hospital setting. Training to care forthe dying patient was linked to the technicalaspects of care and the physical preparation ofthe body after death (Krisman-Scott, 2003). Aresearch and literature review performed byBenoliel for the period 1900-1960 revealedonly 21 articles for nurses about caring for thedying patient. \"There was little evidence thatcare of the dying was ever a major concern ofnurses in this country\" (Quint, 1967, p. 11). As a result of the changes in our attitudes toward death and dying over time, some havesaid that the United States is a death-denyingsociety. Kerry Crammer, MD, said: \"In the Ori-ent, dying is a requirement. In Europe, dying isinevitable. In America, dying appears to be anoption\" (Lewis, 2001, p. 24). This death-denying attitude has created very expensive medical care. Spending on behalf ofMedicare beneficiaries in their last year of life isfive to six times as much as for other beneficiar-ies. Medicare expenditures are not distributedevenly across the last 12 months of life, butaccelerate rapidly in the last few months, peak-ing at 20 times the amount for other beneficiar-ies in the last month of life, as a result ofinpatient hospital spending (Hogan et al., 2003). Even though the expense of medical care at end of life is great, it does not necessarily followthat the needs of the elderly terminally ill arebeing met. The SUPPORT study (the Study to Understand Prognosis and Preferences for Out-comes and Risks of Treatment) conducted overthe last decade reported that nurses often werethe first to recognize the impending death of apatient (Sheehan & Schirm, 2003). It also re-vealed that our health care system does not meeteither the needs of patients with advancedchronic illnesses or the needs of dying, termi-nally ill patients (Quaglietti, Blum, & Ellis,2004). Nor does the care we have come to acceptmeet the wishes of many Americans who are ter-minally ill. The National Hospice Foundation'sresearch reports that 80% of Americans say theirwish is to die at home. Of the 2.4 million Amer-icans who die each year, less than 25% actuallydie at home. Of the 800,000 patients who re-ceive hospice care , over 75% die at home (NHPCO, 2004). Recently, dying is beginning to be seen in a newer, more realistic light. Ira Byock, a leadingpalliative care physician and advocate forimproving care at end of life, has linked dyingto an ongoing potential for growth. \"Dying rep-resents more than a set of problems to be solved;it represents an extraordinary opportunity\u2014anopportunity for review, for restitution, foramends, for exploration, for development, forinsight. In short, it is an opportunity for growth\"(Kinzbrunner, Weinreb, & Policzer, 2002, p. 259). Instead of growing up, growing old, anddying, Dr Byock suggests we grow up, growold, and grow on. \"Growing on takes place forboth the terminally ill aged and their families.And although patients and their families willuniversally find growth producing deaths asimportant and positive, it may not be easy.Indeed there are typically many obstacles thatmust be overcome if the process of death is tounfold in a productive manner\" (McKinnon &Miller, 2002, pp. 259-260). Nurses have the opportunity and ability to influence the process of death by virtue of theirproximity to patients and families. Nurses28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 781 782 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care spend more time with patients and their fami-lies at end of life than any other member of thehealth care team (Ferrell, Grant, & Virani, 1999).Families and patients look to the nurse for sup-port, education, and guidance at this difficulttime, yet little education is provided to preparenurses for this unique type of care. Nurses faceend-of-life situations in almost all practice set-tings, including hospitals, hospices, long-termcare facilities, home care, prisons, and clinics,but many remain uncomfortable providing care.Because of the importance of end-of-life care,nursing education is beginning to focus on careat this stage of life (Hospice and PalliativeNurses Association [HPNA], 2004b). The focus of care at end of life should center on living with terminal illness\u2014with medical care, support, and interventions geared toward qualityof life and comfort, rather than on prolongingsuffering or the dying process\u2014if that is whatpatient wants. In determining the wishes of pa-tients for end-of-life care, their physical, emo-tional, psychosocial, and spiritual needs must allbe addressed. The cumulative nature of theseaspects of a person's life will impact the choicesthey make at this important time. Communication About End of Life Talking about death and dying is often difficultfor both nurses and patients. If the nurse doesn'trespond in a way that encourages discussion,that discussion will likely not take place, anddeath will become the \"elephant in the room\"\u2014something unavoidable and yet taboo (Griffie,Nelson-Marten, & Muchka, 2004). Perhaps the easiest method of learning about a person's preferences is for the caregiver to sim-ply ask them! However, these conversations areoften not held because of fear\u2014the elderly's fearor being perceived as giving up, the family's fearof not wanting the elderly person to think theyare wished to be dead, or perhaps the careprovider's fear of not knowing what to say orhow to discuss bad news. The societal attitudesabout denying death are certainly a factor inwhether these conversations are held. TheNational Hospice Foundation Web site notesthat most people would rather talk to their chil-dren about drugs and sex than to their elderlyparents about terminal illness. There are re-sources designed to assist with these conversa-tions, because nothaving the conversation may prohibit an individual from having the type ofcare they want, simply because they are notaware of the options. The Project to Educate Physicians on End-of- Life Care (EPEC), supported by the AmericanMedical Association and the Robert WoodJohnson Foundation (Emanuel et al., 1999), aswell as ELNEC, views communicating bad newsas an essential skill for physicians. It is also anessential skill for nurses and other interdisci- plinary team members who interact with the patients and families. EPEC Project Module 2 presents a six-step approach to communicating bad news (Emanuel et al., 1999): 1.Get started: Plan what to say, confirm medical facts, create a conducive envi-ronment, determine who else thepatient would like present, and allocateadequate time. 2.Find out what the patient knows: Assess his or her ability to comprehend bad news. 3.Find out how much the patient wants to know:Recognize and support patient preference28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 782 Communication About End of Life 783 Box 22-1 Death and Dying: A Simulation Game This is a very effective guided reflection, with the facilitator reading the scenario, and the participants listening, actively taking part with their responses to the slips of paper and subsequent instructions.The element of surprise is effective if the participants do not know the scenario before beginning theexercise. This exercise often provokes emotional responses, which can then be discussed and processed toincorporate into the learning experience. Supplies: One packet of 12 slips of paper for each participantWriting utensilOverhead transparency of questions for class or small group discussion (optional) Instructions: Slips of paper can be premarked with the following four topics (3 slips foreach topic): A person who is very dear to you A thing you own that you regard as very special An activity in which you enjoy participating A personal attribute or role of which you are proud Verbal instruction by facilitator:Write one item per topic on each slip of paper.Arrange the 12 slips of paper in front of you so you can see all of them.Get into a comfortable position; take a deep relaxing breath.Listen without comment and follow the instructions given to you while I describe some happenings, some situations, and some people. (Facilitator should develop the scenario carefully, allowing time for awakening all the senses.)1. You are at your doctor's office; you hear the diagnosis\u2014cancer. Please select and tear up three slips of paper.(Allow time [15-30 seconds] for selection . . facilitator orassistant may want to physically collect the papers and deposit them in a wastebasket forgreater effect.) 2. You are back at home\u2014who is there? Who do you want to be there? What do you say? What do you want to hear?Please tear up another three slips of paper.(Provide another appropriate-length pause.

Six months have now passed, and you find that even the smallest activity of daily living takes most of your energy. How do you feel about yourself? Where are you? Who is with you?Turn over the last two slips of paper in front of you. I will take one of them at random. (Facilitator takes one of the remaining slips from each participant and tears and discards.) 6. Facilitator says only: Tear up your last slip of paper . . . you have died.Discussion and Reflection:May be discussed in small groups in the class setting.Personal reflection: What issues arose for you from each scenario? Fears? Concerns? What were the easiest things to give up? Most difficult? What emotional reactions did you have with each scenario? (possibly denial, bargain- ing, depression, acceptance, avoidance, relief, comfort, anger, feelings of unfairness,sadness with remembered real-life scenarios) What did you think/feel/experience when one of the slips was randomly taken from you? Did you anticipate the content of the last scenario? What were your thoughts/feelings/reactions to tearing up the last slip of paper? Reflection in reference to the elderly: What different issues would arise for the elderly population? Fears? Concerns? (e.g., caregiving issues, financial concerns, being alone, lack of support, physical limitations) Might an elderly person have a harder/easier time giving up things in the four cate- gories on the slips of paper?

The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), a federal law, requires health care providers toroutinely provide information about advance directives . There are several nationally recog- nized advance directives to help an individualidentify their personal wishes in a legal mannerand to share that information with the peoplearound them, including medical personnel.Durable power of attorney, living will declara-tion, appointment of health care representative,do not resuscitate (DNR) , and life-prolonging procedures declaration are all legally recognizeddocuments for indicating one's health care wishes. Additionally, Five Wishes and Allow Nat- ural Death (AND) offer more recently sug- gested options for stating end-of-life carewishes. Five Wishes is a movement that encour-ages people to provide more specific instructionsthan those offered by a living will, including one'swishes in five categories: The person chosen to make decisions when the individual can no longer makethem for himself or herself\u2014a durablepower of attorney for health care The kind of treatment the person wants or doesn't want\u2014a living will How comfortable the person wants to be How the person wants to be treated by others What the person wants his or her loved ones to know The Five Wishes documents are legal in 38 states and can be used as attachments show-ing intent in the remainder of states (www. agingwithdignity.org/answers.html). An AND order is considered a more descrip- tive and positive order than a DNR. Its focus ison allowing death as nature takes its course atthe end of an illness. DNR implies taking some-thing away, or not doing something for thepatient, (e.g., resuscitation), and can be viewedas a harsh and insensitive statement of medicalcare that promotes a feeling of abandonment bypatients and families alike. AND provides com-fort measures, so that even with the withdrawalof artificially supplied nutrition and hydration,the dying process would occur as comfortably aspossible (Meyer, 2001). Advance directives can also be crafted for spe- cific and personal concerns (e.g., for ongoingcare for dependents or a pet). All advance direc-tives should include a periodic review to ensureclarity and to reflect changing needs and con-cerns. All documents relating to health careshould be discussed with physicians, familymembers, or decision makers and placed in the28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 785 786 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care medical records held by each of the patient'sphysicians. Options for End-of-Life Care Curative, life-prolonging, and acute care options focus on cure. Despite the findings ofthe SUPPORT study, there are those patients,families, and cultures who choose the life-prolonging focus of care of a hospital death.Many of these deaths will take place in an ICUsetting, with tubes, vents, and devices to pro-long life because some cultures promote doingeverything possible to preserve life. It is impor-tant that judgments not be made about thesechoices, but to note that other choices exist aswell. Options for nonlife-prolonging care at endof life are available and focus on comfort ratherthan cure. Hospice care provides one such option, and has the following philosophy: Hospice provides care and support for persons in the last phases of incurable disease so theymay live as fully and comfortably as possible.Hospice recognizes dying as part of the normalprocess of living, and focuses on maintaining thequality of remaining life. Hospice affirms lifeand neither hastens nor postpones death. Hospiceexists in the hope and belief that through appro-priate care, and the promotion of a caring com-munity sensitive to their needs, patients andtheir families may be free to attain a degree ofmental and spiritual preparation for death thatis satisfactory to them. (NHPCO, 2004)(Case Study 22-1 ) Eligibility for hospice services is based on a life expectancy of 6 months or less, if an illnessruns its normal course. Services are available aslong as a patient is considered to be terminallyill, even though it may be longer than 6months. Hospice utilizes a team approach toaddress the physical, emotional, social, and spir-itual needs of the patient and family. Hospice care originated in order to provide comfort and dignity at end of life. Palliative care evolved from the hospice movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It has become more main-stream as nurses and physicians embrace its phi-losophy of whole-person care for those personswith life-limiting illnesses who are not yet eli-gible for hospice support (Bretscher & Creagan,1997). Palliative care refers to the comprehensive management of the physical, psychological,social, spiritual, and existential needs of patients.It is especially suited to the care of people withincurable, progressive illnesses (Quaglietti, Blum,& Ellis, 2004). According to a 1997 task force,palliative care has become an area of specialexpertise within medicine, nursing, social work,pharmacy, chaplaincy, and other disciplines(Task Force on Palliative Care, 1997). The goalof palliative care is to achieve the best possiblequality of life for patients and their families.Control of pain, of other symptoms, and of psy-chological, social, and spiritual problems isparamount (Storey, 1996). It can be very difficult for a patient and fam- ily to choose one of these options for care. Apractical suggestion that may help the patientand/or family in weighing the choices is toencourage a frank discussion with the physician,which would include several important ques-tions: \"What is the expected outcome if I dotreatment option #1? What is the expected out-come if I do treatment option #2? What is theexpected outcome if I do neither of these, and28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 786 Options for End-of-Life Care 787 home care nurse indicates the possibilityof hospice care at home because hospice isappropriate for any end-stage illness andbecause Dee's prognosis was determinedto be 6 months or less by her attendingphysician (according to the NationalHospice Organization's guidelines fornoncancer diagnoses). For end-stage lungdisease, these symptoms include dyspneaat rest, poor response to brochodilatortherapy, and other debilitating symptomssuch as decreased functional activity,fatigue, and cough. Dee has had multiplehospitalizations for these symptoms with-out significant improvement in her overallcondition. Her appetite is fair to poor;constipation has been a problem; she isshort of breath with any exertion and hascrackles to bilateral bases, with frequentcomplaints of mid-back pain. She has 1 /H11001 pedal edema; hands and feet are cyanotic.Her current medications include an ACEinhibitor, furosemide 40 mg qd, pred-nisone 5 mg qd, and O 22 lpm/nc. Jay reports Dee is forgetful, and cries \"at thedrop of a hat.\" Dee is admitted to hospicecare at home.Questions: 1. As the admitting nurse, what are your recommendations after thisinitial assessment? Hospice care is appropriate when the plan of care shifts from cure to comfort.This case study exemplifies this process. Dee is a 72-year-old woman with advanced chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD) with a historyof congestive heart failure (CHF). Shehas been a patient with a home careagency, receiving nursing and physicaltherapy services for the past 6 weeks.Dee has been unable to maintain therigors of physical therapy due to herpoor lung status. She is oxygen andsteroid dependent, and homebound.Dee is dependent on her husband, Jay,also age 72, for all aspects of her care.He is in need of a knee replacement, butis unable to meet this need due to hiscaregiving role. Until several years ago,Dee and Jay enjoyed socialization withfriends and neighbors, going out to din-ner, playing golf and cards, and attend-ing her church on a regular basis. Theyhave a supportive adult daughter whoworks, lives about 15 miles away, isattentive, and visits nearly every day.Their son lives out of state, calls fre-quently, and visits on occasion. Dee voiced to her home care nurse the desire not to return to the hospital, \"Itdoesn't do any good. I'm tired of livingthis way. Can't we do something athome?\" In response to Dee's inquiry, theCase Study 22-1 (continues)28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 787 788 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care know their individualized plan ofcare is under the direction ofDee's attending physician andmanaged by the interdisciplinaryteam, which includes the servicesof a hospice-skilled medicaldirector. Although apparentlyoverwhelmed by the admissionprocess, Dee and Jay initiallyagreed to a nurse, social worker,and home health aide (HHA),and decide to consider a volun-teer and chaplain. The primary nurse first attends to physical symptoms, becausethat is often the overwhelmingneed. Dee's shortness of breath isher complaint; after con-sultation the attendingphysician, the nurse receivedorders to initiate liquid morphine5 mg q 4 h prn. The nurseinstructed and demonstrated theuse of morphine to Jay and Deebecause he will be responsible foradministration of medications. Depending on the underlying pathology of Dee's back pain, theliquid morphine may also helpthis complaint. An NSAID wasordered for possible bone pain. Adding opioids contributes to additional constipation, so astool softener/laxative wasordered on a scheduled basis. Because ADLs are an increasing problem, and in light of Jay's2. What team members should be a part of Dee's care plan? 3. How can we determine Dee's goals for her end of life? 4. Evaluate Dee's emotional status; how does it affect her daily func-tioning? How does it affect herrelationship with her husband?How can other team membersassist with these issues? 5. What impact do Dee's spiritual life/beliefs have on her condi-tion and functional ability? 6. How might we offer Jay assis- tance in meeting the physicalcare needs of Dee? 7. What can be done for Dee's shortness of breath? 8. What should be done for Dee's complaint of constipation? 9. How might one address Dee's back pain? Suggested Actions/Responses The easiest way to determine a patient/family's goals is to sim-ply ask them! Dee is in physicaldistress, so that is foremost onher mind. Addressing her physi-cal needs first will allow her tobe able to identify and concen-trate on other goals as her com-fort is increased. Based on physical and psycho- social-spiritual assessment, Deeand Jay are offered the servicesof the whole hospice team. They28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 788 End-of-Life Hospice Care 789 choose comfort care?\" Weighing the answers toeach of these questions may help the individualmake an informed choice, based on the differ-ences between the expected outcomes and theindividual's own philosophy about how to expe-rience his or her end of life (see Figure 22-1 ). End-of-Life Hospice Care Cicely Saunders, a nurse, and physi-cian, started St. Christopher's Hospice in Londonin 1967. She incorporated a variety of team mem-bers to work together to help with the problemsof care at end of life. The success of her type of careprompted expansion of hospice services to otherparts of the world. Hospice care has existed in theUnited States since 1974 (Storey, 1996). The U.S. government, recognizing the cost- effectiveness of hospice care, incorporated hos-pice benefits into the Medicare program in1983. Credentialing agencies require that hos-pices provide all of the mandated services inorder to be licensed and/or certified by Medicareand Medicaid and to be recognized by otherinsurers and some states. Reimbursement toprovider agencies is contingent upon this certi-fication (Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices [CMS], 2004). According to the CMS Conditions of Partic- ipation and standards, hospice services include,but are not limited to:and realization that her illness islife-ending. However, she isadamant about staying at home,avoiding rehospitalization, andvoices several times that she is\"tired, not able to fight this any-more. I want to be comfortable. Iwant Jay to have help.\" When Dee's symptoms indicated she was near death, and when Jaycould no longer physically pro-vide her care, she was transferredto the hospice center for the lastweek of her life. She receivedaround-the-clock symptom man- agement and physical care, allow- ing Jay to change roles from thatof caregiver to husband.knee pain, hospice can assistwith assistance tofull bed-bath is availabledepending on Dee's ona given day. The social worker often accom- panies the admitting nurse forthe admission process. Thisenables the family to be exposedto the \"team\" from the verybeginning, as well as allowingthe social worker to hear thepatient/family \"story\" from thebeginning, as an aid to assess-ment. Initial assessment revealsDee is somewhat tearful indescribing her physical decline28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 789 790 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care Figure 22-1 Algorithm with Life-Limiting Illness Needing End-of-Life Care Prognosis /H113496 months Patient now has prognosis of /H113496 months or curative therapy discontinuedPalliative therapy only Refer to hospice programCurative and palliative therapyPrognosis /H113506 months Refer to nonhospice palliative care program Choose a program that can assure YES answers to all or most questionsQuestions to Ask:Is the hospice certified by Medicare?Is by JCAHO or agency?Does the hospice offer care, general residents of long-termcare care provided in a dedicated unitmanned by hospice-trained and employed staff?Does the hospice allow the attending physicianto continue to actively care for the patient?Does the hospice have alidated guidelines forpain and symptom management?Does the hospice have an active bereavementprogram?Questions to Ask:Is the program supported by a recognized fund-ing agency or other recognized institution?Does the program provide care in bothinpatient and home care settings?If not, does the program have relationships toensure that care can be provided in bothsettings?Is the staff of the program specially trained inpalliative care?Does the program allow the attending physi-cian to continue to actively care for thepatient?Does the program have validated guidelines forpain and symptom management?Does the program have an active bereavementprogram ?

Complementary therapies are not required but are often provided to enhance the patient/family care with services such as massage, heal-ing touch, music therapy, pet therapy, and oth-ers. Many of these additional therapies areprovided by volunteers skilled in these particu-lar areas.Focus on Symptoms Among the nurse's primary responsibilities asa member of any interdisciplinary team is tocoordinate the patient's care and to assist withmanagement of the patient's symptoms. Theremainder of this chapter will provide practi-cal assistance with managing the variety ofsymptoms frequently encountered at end of life (Case Study 22-2 ). Physical, Nonpain Symptoms RespiratoryDyspnea means a distressing difficulty in breath- ing. It is a symptom, not a sign. A patient mayhave difficulty breathing and have no abnormalphysical signs. Dyspnea, like pain, is whateverthe patient perceives it to be. Episodic shortnessof breath is sometimes due to hyperventilation.Any patient with dyspnea is prone to episodesof anxiety or panic. The goal of treatment forterminal dyspnea is to relieve the perception ofbreathlessness (Enck, 1992). Opioid therapy is used to treat shortness of breath. Morphine reduces the inappropriate andexcessive respiratory drive. A low dose is usuallyvery effective\u2014liquid morphine 2.5-5 mg POevery 4 hours is a good starting dose. It may alsobe given subcutaneously at one third the oral doseif the patient is unable to swallow. It reduces inap-propriate tachypnea (rapid breathing) and over-ventilation of the large airways (dead space). It doesnot cause CO 2retention, and can reduce cyanosis by slowing ventilation and making breathingmore efficient. Morphine does not depress respira-tions when used judiciously and titrated appro-priately. For patients who do not toleratemorphine, other opioids such as oxycodone andhydromorphone can be used (McKinnis, 2002). 28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 791 792 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care stating \"I don't think Dad would wanta tube in his stomach, but he never toldme that for sure.

How would you help Jake's daughter understand the benefitsand burdens of tube feedings? 4. How would your hospital-based team address the son's differingopinion? 5. What treatment would be appropriate for Jake's pain? His shortness of breath? Thecrackles in his lungs?Despite studies showing the majority of people would prefer to die outsidethe hospital setting, there are those whofind comfort in a more structured envi-ronment. Death in the hospital need notbe a terrible or frightening event, asevidenced in this case study. Jake is a 90-year-old male, diag- nosed with end-stage dementia. Hehas been living in the home of hisdaughter and son-in-law, who are re-tired and in their 60s. His daughter isa power of attorney- health care rep- resentative. He has a living will inwhich he indicates an intentional non-decision about artificially supplied nu-trition and hydration. In the past 2 years,he has become progressively weaker,unable to ambulate, unable to carry ona meaningful conversation, and increas-ingly incontinent of bowel and bladder.He was admitted to the hospital withdehydration and lethargy. A hydrationIV has been started at 75 cc/hr. Thephysician has mentioned the possibilityof a G-tube for feedings if the family sowishes. The CNA reports Jake moanedwhen she turned him during his bath,and he did not arouse when sheattempted to feed him his breakfast. You are the nurse caring for this patient. The daughter is in a quandary,Case Study 22-228438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 792 Focus on Symptoms 793 Anxiety can be precipitated by the fear of suf- focation, which worsens the perception of dysp-nea, creating a vicious cycle. Antianxiety agents,such as lorazapam 0.5-2.0 mg every 4-6 hoursPRN, will help with restlessness and thus oftendecrease respiratory effort. It can be given PO,SL, bucally, or rectally (McKinnis, 2002). Oxygen may not be effective if hypoxemia is not the cause of dyspnea, but may have a placeboeffect and decrease the individual's anxiety. O 2 should be started at 2 l/nc; increase to 4 l/nc ifneeded.Other helpful and practical techniques might include: Head of the bed elevated 30-45 degrees Cool, humidified air Relaxation techniques Fan at bedside or ceiling fan Excess secretions , resulting from fluid overload from artificial hydration or from increasinginability to swallow secretions, allow a buildupin large airways, causing a rattling sound. Thisrattle may be more distressing to the family atfears and feelings about Jake's end-of-life status. Quality-of-life issuesmight also be discussed, in order toascertain the importance of this fam-ily's cultural background in theirdecision making. Jake's nonverbal cues of pain must be addressed. Because dementiapatients are often unable to reportpain or its location, it is importantfor the nurse to observe behaviorand treat appropriately. BecauseJake is having difficulty swallowing,oral medications are not feasable. Alow-dose opioid by IV or SQ routewould be appropriate. The low-dose opioid initiated for pain would help with his shortnessof breath; supplemental oxygen mayalso be of benefit. Lowering or dis-continuing the IV rate couldimprove the congestion and edema.The addition of hyoscine could alsobe helpful.Suggested Actions/Responses Jake's symptoms clearly indicate process. You notify thephysician of the family's quandaryand request permission to set a fam-ily meeting for discussion of all theissues, including his terminal status. In answering the daughter's ques- tions about G-tubes, you explain toher that sometimes a G-tube may bebeneficial when the outcome isuncertain\u2014for example, when thereis potential for recovery as in a caraccident or after a CVA. Dementiais a progressive disease, with littlehope for improvement, and with anexpectation of terminality at somepoint in time. When fluids areadded to a failing body, the burdensmay outweigh the benefits. Theseburdens might include increasedcongestion, edema, and nausea. The hospital social worker and/or chaplain might explore Jake's son's 28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 793 794 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care bedside than uncomfortable for the patient.Scopolamine TD or SQ or hyoscyamine SL maybe helpful in treating this condition (McKinnis,2002).GastrointestinalConstipation results from a variety of causes for persons at end of life. Nonmedical causesinclude inactivity and decrease in food and fluidintake. Exercise contributes to bowel motility,but persons with life-ending illnesses are oftenincapacitated by their disease processes. Med-ications used to control pain almost always havea constipating effect. Rather than withholdingopioids, the constipating side effects of the med-ications must be treated. A combination sof-tener/stimulant should be used, because use of asoftener alone could lead to a soft impaction.Legend indicates that Dr. Cicely Saunders (motherof the modern hospice movement) gave a lecturein which every fourth slide read, \"Nothing mat-ters more than the bowels!\" (Levi, 1991). Nausea/vomiting , while common at end of life, it may have multiple causes. Treatment of choicedepends upon which of four areas of the brain arestimulated. One or more of these areas sends amessage to the vomiting center located in themid-brain, causing emesis. For this reason, acombination of medications may be required tocontrol nausea and vomiting. Storey (1986) liststhe following four areas: 1. Cerebral cortex Stimulated by overwhelming visual, sensory, or cognitive input Anxiety\u2014may control with lorazepam Brain metastases (due to intracranial pressure) May respond to dexamethasone2. Vestibular apparatus Inner ear responsible for motion sick- ness (e.g., infection or Meniere'sdisease) May respond to cyclizine, meclizine, or hyoscine 3. Chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) (Most common causes of nausea aremediated by this route) Triggered by uremia, hypercalcemia, chemotherapy, and certain drugs Mild\u2014may respond to hyoscine patch or promethazine More severe\u2014may amore antiemetic 4. Caused material in stom- ach, peptic ulcers, severe constipa-tion, or bowel obstruction \"Squashed stomach syndrome\" or bowel obstruction\u2014may respond tohalperidol Delayed gastric emptying\u2014use metoclopramide Anxiety and DeliriumAnxiety at end of life can be caused by a variety of factors. Loss of control, loss of self-esteem, and lossof independence can be very distressing to a per-son who has previously been autonomous. Achange in environment for the dying person mayadd to the anxiety. These changes may be large\u2014as in a family caregiver, a place of care, or meetingnew professional staff\u2014or small, such as a changeof bed or medication. Treatment for anxietyincludes relieving physical symptoms that may bepresent, such as pain or shortness of breath. Thesimple presence of someone the dying person28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 794 Focus on Symptoms 795 trusts can be very reassuring. Antianxiety med-ications may also be used in conjunction withthese interventions (Wright, 2002). Delirium is a fluctuating cognitive distur- bance, characterized by changes in mental statusover a short period of time. It occurs in the lasthours to days of life in a large percentage ofdying patients. Delirium is especially devastat-ing to family and friends because it can stand inthe way of meaningful conversations and good-byes. The most common physical causes mayinclude dyspnea, pain, constipation, or urinaryretention, all of which can be treated. Envi-ronmental comfort can be provided by reducingstimuli, reorientation if possible, familiar per-sons at bedside, and interdisciplinary team mem-bers providing emotional, social, and spiritualsupport. Music therapy, therapeutic/healing touch,and nonmedical nursing interventions should beconsidered. Antianxiety medications, used cau-tiously, may also be helpful. Nutrition and HydrationDeclining appetite is a natural occurrence in the process of dying. This concept is one of the mostdifficult for caregivers to embrace, because oursociety tends to equate love with provision offood. When end of life nears, the body is lessactive and requires less nourishment. From thepatient's perspective, food does not taste thesame, so favorite foods may no longer providecomfort; appetite is easily satisfied by bites offood rather than regular portions. Caregiversshould be encouraged to offer small amounts ofa variety of foods. When a patient clenches hisor her teeth with feeding attempts, it may be hisor her way of exerting control. The attempt to artificially hydrate may be detrimental to comfort, because the failing bodymay not be able to process the added fluids, con-tributing to fluid overload. Thirst may be satis-fied by providing small amounts of oral fluids,popsicles, or ice chips. Dry mouth may be suc-cessfully managed with meticulous mouth care(Kinzbrunner, 2002). Physical, Pain Symptoms Issues Pertinent to Pain in the Elderly Albert Schweitzer said, \"We all must die. But ifI can save him from days of torture, that is whatI feel is my great and ever new privilege. Pain isa more terrible lord of mankind than even deathitself.\" Pain in the elderly is particularly problematic. \"Unrelieved pain can contribute to unnecessarysuffering, as evidenced by sleep disturbance,hopelessness, loss of control and impaired socialinteractions. Pain may actually hasten death byincreasing physiological stress, decreasing contributing to pneumonia and throm-boemboli\" (HPNA, 2004a). Underreporting ofpain is common, because the elderly learn toexpect chronic pain and accept it as part ofgrowing older. They may minimize pain toavoid diagnostic testing or to protect families orthemselves against a poor prognosis. They mayalso use softening words, such as discomfort, soreness, or aching instead of the word pain. In addition, health care providers may tend to underestimateand undertreat pain in this population, for fearof promoting addiction to pain medications. Research has shown that approximately 25%-50% of community-dwelling elders havesignificant chronic pain, and between 45%and 80% of nursing home residents haveundertreated, substantial pain. The pain ofthose in nursing homes is generally \"underap-preciated, underreported and undertreated\"(Ferrell, 1991, p. 2). 28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 795 796 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care Additionally, McCaffery and Pasero (1999) identify that there are many misconceptionsabout pain in the elderly. Pain is a natural outcome of growing old. Pain perception or sensitivity decreases with age. If an elderly person does not report pain, he or she does not have pain. If an elderly patient appears to be asleep or otherwise distracted, he or she doesnot have pain. Potential side effects of opioids make them too dangerous to use to relievepain in the elderly. Alzheimer patients and others with cognitive impairments do not havepain, and their reports of pain are mostlikely invalid. It is important that nurses recognize the many facets of pain in older dying adults. Theplan of care should be guided by considerationof physical, psychological, and social aspects ofpain. This interdisciplinary plan should evolveover time, in response to the patient's changingneeds (Gibson & Schroeder, 2001). To successfully treat pain, the nurse must be able to assess the pain of the individual. \"Pain iswhatever the experiencing person says it is,existing whenever he says it does\" (McCaffery,1968, p. 95). However, individuals may requireassistance in describing their pain. A commonlyused pain scale is in Figure 22-2 . Treatment of pain in the elderly is very effec- tive when based on a basic understanding of ori-gins of pain and a systematic approach totreatment. Different types of pain require dif-ferent treatments. Sometimes a combination ofpain medication and adjuvants (such as antide-pressants or anticonvulsants) can be more ther-apeutic than each used alone. Pharmacological interventions remain the first line of treatment for unrelieved pain.Opioids are needed when pain does not re-spond to nonopioids alone. Some cliniciansand patients avoid opioids due to fear of addic-tion. Nurses need to be able to understand andexplain to patients and families the differencebetween addiction, tolerance, and physical de- 0 NO HURT 01 HURTS LITTLE BIT 22 HURTS LITTLE MORE 43 HURTS EVEN MORE 64 HURTS WHOLE LOT 85 HURTS WORST 10Alternate codingFigure 22-2 Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale.

The findings of severalstudies have shown that addiction as a resultof using opioids for pain relief occurs in patients (McCaffery & Paseo, 1999)(Box major physiological types\u2014nociceptive and neuropathic. Nociceptivepain is further divided into two types, somaticand visceral. Somatic nociceptive pain typically involves the following symptoms and treatments: Tissue injury resulting in stimulation of afferent nerve endings. The skeletal system, soft tissue, joints, skin, or connective tissue. The patient typically can localize the pain, may be able to point with fingerto area; may describe as dull, aching,throbbing, or gnawing in nature. Best treated with NSAIDS and partially responsive to opioid therapy; mayrequire a combination. Examples: bone fracture, bone metastases, muscle strain. Visceral nociceptive pain typically involves the following: Activation of nociceptors Internal organs Patient often unable to localize, may use an open hand to show area affected,because pain may be diffuse May describe as deep, aching, cramping, or sensation of pressure Very responsive to opioid therapy Examples: shoulder pain, secondary to lung or liver metastasesBox 22-2 Research Highlight Aim: This study attempted to evaluate the suffering of terminally ill dementiapatients over time, from admission tothe hospital until death. Method: The study included consecutive end-stage dementia patients who weredying in the hospital. Using the MiniSuffering State Examination scale (MSSE),71 patients in a 2-year period were evalu-ated weekly for level of suffering. Findings: Using the MSSE scale, 63.4% of patients died with high levels of suf-fering, and 29.6% died with intermedi-ate levels of suffering. The level ofsuffering actually increased during thehospital stay, which averaged about 38days. Seven percent of patients diedwith a low level of suffering. The mostsignificant aspects of suffering includedrestlessness, pressure sores, nutritionalissues, and medical instability. Conclusion: Despite traditional nursing and medical care, a significant portionof dying dementia patients experiencedan increase in suffering as theyapproached death. New palliative mea-sures need to be developed for dyingdementia patients. Source: Aminoff, B. Z., & Adunsky, A. (2004).

Follow-ing are the definitions used by theAmerican Pain Society (1992): Opioid addiction is psychologic dependence. It is \"a pattern of compul-sive drug use characterized by contin-ued craving for an opioid and the needto use the opioid for effects other thanpain relief \" (McCaffery & Pasero, 1999,p. 50) or for non-medical reasons. Inother words, taking opioids for painrelief is not addiction, regardless of thedose or length of time on opioids. Physical dependence is the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms when theopioid is suddenly stopped or an antag-onist such as naloxone (Narcan) isgiven. Withdrawal symptoms usuallyare easily suppressed by gradual with-drawal of the opioid. Tolerance is a decrease in one or more effects of the opioid (e.g., decreased anal-gesia, sedation, or respiratory depression).Tolerance to analgesia may be treatedwith increases in dose. However, diseaseprogression, not tolerance to analgesia,appears to be the reason for most doseescalations. Thus, tolerance to analgesiaposes very few clinical problems.

Loss and Grief The elderly are confronted with a variety oflosses in many aspects of their lives, not justwith the death of a spouse, family members, orlong-time friends. Loss of bodily function occursas illness becomes more prevalent. Loss of sup-port systems and family and friends occurs ascompanions die. Loss of independence is a fac-tor as one's physical abilities wane, includingloss of mobility, decision making, and access tovarious other support systems. Not only are thebodily functions lost, but the realization ofnever regaining these functions is particularlydifficult. Primary losses are the loss of peopleclose to them\u2014spouses, children, parents, orsiblings. Secondary losses are those resultingfrom the primary loss\u2014companionship, rolesthe deceased assumed in the relationship (e.g.,bill payer, cook), and independence. Although the terms griefand mourning are fre- quently used interchangeably, each does have aspecific meaning. Grief is the natural and normal response to loss of any kind and is experiencedpsychologically, behaviorally, socially, and physi-28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 798 Focus on Symptoms 799 Box 22-4 Gone From My Sight: The Dying Experience Summary of guidelines for impending deathRecognizing that each person approaches death in his or her own way, there are some identi- fied patterns that assist in the recognition of end-stage status, noted in common languagefor ease of comprehension by patients and families. cally. It involves many changes over time (Rando,1993). Mourning is the cultural and/or public display of grief through one's behaviors. Theseinclude accepting the reality of the loss, reactingto the separation and finding ways to channel thereactions, handling the unfinished business, andtransferring the attachment to the deceased fromphysical presence to symbolic interaction. It seeksto accommodate the loss by integrating its reali-ties into ongoing life (Rando, 1993). Wolfelt(2001) distinguishes mourning as the sharedsocial response to grief\u2014grief gone public.

Copyright 1986.28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 799 800 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care In this author's experience with hospice be- reavement support, the practical application ofthis information leads to a relatively simpleconcept that seems logical and is perhaps moreeasily remembered by people who are mourn-ing: The goal of grieving is not to \"get over it\"as much of our society encourages, but rather tofigure out how to go on living without the lovedone actively present in one's life. Alan Wolfelt (2004) suggests the following mourner's reconciliation needs: Acknowledge/accept the reality of the death. Embrace the pain of the loss. Convert the relationship of the person who died from one of presence to one ofmemory. Develop a new self-identity. Search for meaning. Receive ongoing support from others. These present some challenges for the elderly because of the limits they may experience phys-ically and emotionally, and due to chronic orother illnesses. However, it is still important toemphasize reasonable versus unreasonableexpectations\u2014grievous loss will produce stronggrief, and mourners must be allowed to experi-ence the full dimensions of their unique process. There are patterns to grief that help describe and show progression in the mourning process,regardless of age. Knowing patterns exist issometimes comforting, but individualized re-sponses must be acknowledged and affirmed. Areasonable goal is to find a personal balance ineach of the aspects of grief patterns\u2014physicalaspects such as eating and sleeping and emo-tional aspects such as tears and stoicism, toname a few\u2014as the mourner attempts to incor-porate the loss into his or her daily life patterns.The mourning process has been characterized by stages or phases . Although it is tempting to consider it as a neat and tidy progression, theconcept of overlapping, retrogressing, and re-curring jumbles of feelings and responses isprobably more realistic. Phases include theperiod of numbness occurring at the time of theloss, which provides some emotional protectionfor a brief time. The period of yearning for theloved one's return tends to deny the permanenceof the loss for a time, and may include feelingsof anger about a variety of aspects of the loss(including, for example, anger at the medicalprofession, at the person who died, and/or atGod). The phase of disorganization and despairis one of difficulty in functioning in the envi-ronment, in which the mourner begins to do thefiguring out of how to function in each area of disarray. The phase of reorganized behavior iswhen one pulls life back together, and in whicha new normal might be identified (Parkes & Bowlby in Worden, 1991). A brief review of the risk factors for compli- cated mourning provides special insight into thevulnerabilities of the elderly, especially in lightof the secondary losses noted above. Accordingto Rando (1993), there are seven high risk fac-tors in two categories that might predispose aperson to complicated mourning. Factors associated with the specific death: Sudden, unexpected (traumatic, violent, random) Overly lengthy illness (multidimensional stresses including anger, ambivalence,guilt, problems obtaining health care) Loss of a child, including adult children Perception of the death as preventable (lack of closure, attempt to regain con-trol, search for reasons and meaning)28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 800 Focus on Symptoms 801 Antecedent and subsequent variables: Markedly angry/ambivalent/dependent relationship Unaccommodated losses/stresses/mental health problems Perception of lack of social support Mourners must be given the opportunity to process the aspects of their grief, but in a con-text that is helpful to them. Nurses, who arelikely to frequently encounter grieving patients,can facilitate the mourning process by beingaware of the aspects of grief and mourning, andby advocacy with the people who surround themourner. Alan Wolfelt (2004) suggests aMourner's Bill of Rights to help mourners siftout the unacceptable advice they are often given.This includes the right to: Experience unique grief, without the pressure of \"shoulds/shouldn'ts\" Talk about grief, or to be silent as needed Feel a multitude of emotions, without feeling judgment Tolerate physical and emotional limits, and fatigue Experience sudden surges of grief Use rituals Embrace spirituality, or not Search for meaning; some questions may not have answers Treasure memories; share them Move toward grief and heal; avoid people who are intolerant of your grief Recognize that \"grief is a process, not an event.\" Other ways nurses can help include active lis- tening without judging the mourner, havingcompassion and allowing the expression of feel-ings without criticizing, allowing the mournerto identify his or her own feelings without say-ing, \"I know how you feel,\" and offering pres-ence over time (Wolfelt, 2005a). Frequently, when an elderly person experi- ences the death of a spouse of long standing, thelife expectancy of the remaining spouse may beshortened because of the inability to reconcilethe needs of mourning, the complications ofgrief, and the lack of physical and emotionalreserves to make the additional investment intoa reconfiguration of one's own future. It is alsoimportant to note the potential for difference inmourning styles between men and women, andbetween various cultural styles. Box 22-5 Psychosocial and Spiritual Opportunities Near the End of Life The opportunity to... Reframe society's view of dying: grow on! Expand the definition of quality of life. Focus on the individual, not the disease. Address as a whole physical pain, psy cho- social issues, and spiritual concerns. Move through fear to peace.Move through confusion to meaning.Move through despair to hope.Move from isolation to community.Come to terms with the physical body.Move from loss to closure.Adjust to new roles.Get affairs in End-of-Life Care Psychosocial, Emotional, andSpiritual Symptoms Although we frequently attempt to distinguishamong psychosocial, emotional, and spiritualissues, the reality is that the range and depth ofbeing human makes it nearly impossible to rec-ognize where one aspect of being ends andanother begins. It has been suggested to addressthese areas as a continuum, and to view the is-sues that arise in these aspects of our humanfunctioning at end of life as opportunities,rather than as problems (McKinnon & Miller,2002). \"For those caring for the terminally ill,psychosocial and spiritual issues that in the pasthave been seen as problems can, with informa-tion and compassion, become opportunities\u2014opportunities that will allow each of us to livefully until we say goodbye\" (McKinnon & Miller,p. 273). Some issues that arise must be viewed in a practical light, because addressing them mightassist in providing resources for the dying el-derly to promote quality of life and dignity(Case Study 22-3 ). Psychosocial IssuesWhen family members are the primary care-givers of the elderly, role changes are very com-mon. Caregivers may resist providing increasingphysical care, not wanting to recognize thedecline or not wanting to diminish the dignityof the patient. The patient may resist it as well,resenting the need for the increased level of carebecause it demonstrates yet more limitations andinabilities in level of independence. Caregiversmay not comprehend the emotional changes andresistance of their elder, and may become frus-trated with the increasing tasks of care and withthe emotional burdens of its constancy. It may be helpful for caregivers to view the last year of a person's life as a reversal of the firstyear of life. This revised perspective helps thecaregiver see that the person is not intentionallyincreasingly helpless, or necessarily giving upcertain functions. Rather, he or she may be los-ing abilities in a reverse order of that in whichinfants gain abilities over the first year of life.These may affect the areas of mobility, activitiesof daily living, cognition, and personal careneeds. As physical ability declines, people beginto withdraw from activities, which may furtherincrease dependence on persons around themand their sense of isolation. Having sufficient physical care\u2014whether from family, paid caregiver resources, or inassisted living or long-term care facilities\u2014is important for those facing end of life. Whatconstitutes sufficient physical care may varywith the individual, but it is always an aspect ofend-of-life care that will become more impor-tant as the person's physical abilities decline.Although some elderly enjoy this increased de-pendence, very independent individuals oftenfind this increasing caregiver need to be one ofthe hardest aspects of treatment to accept. Many patients and families have financial concerns. The concerns are greater, of course, forindividuals or families with few resources, orwith only some resources. Although subsidiesfor some services are available, many people maynot have the ability to access them. The pallia-tive care or hospice team may be helpful in link-ing the patient and family with appropriatefinancial resources. Nurses may also want tohave basic information available for possiblereferrals when access to other team members isnot available. There are agencies and individu-als available to augment the family's ability toprovide care. Most require private pay resources,28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 802 Focus on Symptoms 803 about managing her husband's care.Maria is crying and seems to be in apanic about how to manage her hus-band's increasing needs\u2014Jose seems tohave a lot of pain, he is incontinent withincreasing frequency, and has slipped tothe ground with transfers to the bath-room overnight. The physician calls the home/hospice care agency with an order to evaluateJose and Maria's situation. Wishing to evaluate for the possibil- ity of hospice care, the agency sends anurse and social worker to evaluate thepatient's condition and caregiver status.Upon physical assessment, the nurseperceives that the patient's time isshort\u2014perhaps hours to a few days, notweeks. The social worker identifies thatthe wife, age 75, has a history of arthri-tis and high blood pressure, and willneed assistance to provide for Jose'smuch increased care needs. The couplehas no children of their own, andMaria's two adult children live on oppo-site sides of the country and areunaware of the most recent changes intheir stepfather's condition. Maria appears to be unaware of Jose's end-of-life status. She is talkingabout building his strength, making hisfavorite foods so he'll eat more, andarranging for him to attend the armySometimes, referral to hospice is pro- vided at the very end of life. The patientand family are still able to benefit fromthe comfort philosophy when the lifeexpectancy is hours or days, rather thanweeks. However, the care may often beprovided in a crisis-resolving mode, asevidenced in this case study. Jose is a 76-year-old man who has advanced prostate cancer, metastatic tothe lungs. He has been treated with hor-mone injections for the past 4 years andhas had radiation therapy. He has beenfunctioning with the assistance of hiswife Maria, has been able to go tolunch with his retired work buddies,and enjoyed sports and the nightlynews on TV until about 1 month ago.Upon return home from his most recenthospitalization, Jose continued to haveback pain (rated 7 on a 0-10 scale)unrelieved by hydrocodone. He is nowincreasingly weak, sleeping much of theday and night, and is short of breathwith any exertion\u2014even talking. He isdisinterested in TV, newspapers, orother outside interests, and is consum-ing only bites and sips of food and flu-ids. Jose has voiced concerns aboutaddiction to pain medications. His wifeis unable to get him into the physician'soffice for the scheduled follow-up visit,and calls the physician with concern Case Study 22-3 (continues)28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 803 hospice care\u2014but not intheir home? Suggested Actions/Responses The nurse and social worker need to address Jose's poor con-dition, and the reality that hewill not likely be here nextmonth in order to help Jose andMaria understand the gravity ofhis condition, and the probablebrevity of his life expectancy. To alleviate Maria's apparent denial, they begin by asking Maria about thelast hospitalization\u2014what the doctorstold them about Jose's condition andwhat to expect in the future. Mariareports that the doctors didn't really sayanything different than before: Jose is tosee the doctor in the office tomorrow,maybe he can have another round ofradiation treatments, if he can build uphis strength in the next few weeks. The nurse and social worker then talk with Maria about her obser-vation of the changes she hasnoticed in Jose's condition overthe past few weeks. Maria has noted the increased physi- cal weakness, falls, very poor appetite,and increased sleep since his returnhome from the hospital. Jose awakensfor part of this conversation, and statesthat he thinks his time is short. \"I knowI'm weaker. It's just hard for her toreunion next month that he had solooked forward to. Questions: 1.

Receiving it, she requests theappropriate medications for com-fort, including a short-acting opi-ate breath with the anxiety accompa-nying Jose's shortness of breath. Maria indicates they would accept the services of hospice. Services areexplained to her, including the supportshe is now receiving from the nurse andsocial worker, an HHA for Jose's per-sonal care, the medical equipment tomake care easier, as well as educationabout other team roles. In discussing their support system, Maria indicates a strong relationshipwith their church and priest. The churchhas a parish nursing program, and oneof the nurses has a committee of peoplewilling to help those who are strugglingwith illness. Maria agrees that now isthe time for this support from theirchurch. She places a call to the priest,outlining their current situation andplans for hospice admission today. Shealso requests a home visit by the priestfor confession, communion, and anoint-ing of the sick for Jose. Maria calls her children to let them know of Jose's decline; her son willcome for a long weekend arriving \"in aday or two.\" Her son-in-law is out oftown on business, and her daughter willtry to contact him about the changes, soshe can come as well.accept.\" Jose also says he \"does notwant to go back to the hospital. It's sonoisy there, and it's too hard for Mariato get back and forth to visit there, andI don't think they can help me any-more.\" Maria is tearful, chiding Joseabout giving up. Jose is obviously tired,but accepts a brief explanation of hos-pice philosophy and services. He indi-cates that \"It's OK with me, but I willdo whatever Maria wants. She's the onewho needs to iron out the details.\" Hedozes off shortly after making thesecomments. Maria feels more free to talk, and speaks of Jose's independence, and herpromise to keep him at home. \"He hasalways taken care of me, and now I wantto do that for him.\" The social workerprovides her with printed informationabout patterns of condition and actionsat end of life, and gently and honestlydiscusses the implications of the variousobservations Maria has made aboutJose's condition. Maria begins to seethat, according to her own observations,Jose really is nearing his dying process. Because the nurse believes the patient meets the hospice admis-sion criteria with a prognosis of 6months or less, and because sheand the social worker perceivethe apparent crisis situation withJose and his wife, she notifies thephysician that the patient isunable to meet the appointmenttomorrow and requests an order (continues)28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 805 806 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care department to assist in picking upthe patient if he slides to the flooragain. The on-call availability ofhospice team members and param-eters for their use is explained toMaria, with the number to callprominently posted on her refrig-erator. A hospice volunteer isreferred to allow Maria time totake a nap or to obtain a fewgroceries. Maria asks if she canuse the hospice volunteer to keepJose company while she visits thefuneral home to make sure theirarrangements are in place. AnHHA is scheduled for tomorrowmorning to provide a bed, bath,shave, and hair-washing for Jose. When Maria has calmed, the church friend has arrived, the DME is on theway, and delivery of the medications isin process, the nurse and social workerreview contact information, instruc-tions, and plans for the nurse's visit thefollowing day. Maria is again tearful,but this time with gratitude for the helpand organization she has received.Maria and Jose (who is again asleep)have come a long way in their adjust-ments in a short period of time. Mariasays wistfully, \"I wish the doctor hadbeen as clear as you were in talking tome about what to expect. Jose and Icould have been getting ready for thisfor awhile now.\" Jose died comfortably a few days later, with Maria and her son at his side.This hospice has a local inpatient center in their community, but Maria isadamant at this point in keeping Jose athome, if that is what he wants. Josewould medically qualify for the inpa-tient care due to his uncontrolled symp-toms and probable brief prognosis. To allay Jose's fears of addiction, the nurse explains the differencebetween physical and psycholog-ical need for medication. Shepoints out that his need is forphysical relief, not for a psycho-logical high. She explains that\"if you were diabetic, you wouldtake insulin. If you had highblood pressure, you would takemedication for that. You havepain, so you need medication tocontrol your pain. This is not apsychological addiction, but it isto meet a physical need in yourbody. We could start with asmall dose, to see how thataffects you, and can increase thedoses a little bit at a time, untilyou are more comfortable.\" The social worker, in the mean- time, with Maria and Jose's per-mission, arranges for the deliveryof a hospice-provided hospital bedfor placement in th eir living room, near the hub of activity in thehouse, and close to the bathroom,kitchen, and his favorite reclinerchair. The social worker alsoprovides Maria with the non-emergency number for the fire 28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 806 Focus on Symptoms 807 but some are government sponsored in order tokeep people in their homes a bit longer (e.g.,some Medicaid-sponsored hours that provide in-home support are available in some states forthose individuals who financially qualify).Emotional IssuesA person's place in the life cycle affects theirreaction to end-of-life circumstances. As anelderly person faces death, the individual looksback upon life and reflects upon its experiences.There is an attempt to emotionally integrate allthe aspects of one's life, including determinationof its meaning and acceptance of its uniqueness(Rando, 1984). It is an unfair exaggeration toimply that the elderly are all at peace with theircoming death. Some are and some are not. Theelderly do appear to see death as an importantissue, one they often think about and plan for.\"One of the most surprising lessons our teachers(the dying) offer is that life doesn't end with thediagnosis of a life-challenging illness\u2014that'swhen it truly begins . . . because when youacknowledge the reality of your death, you alsohave to acknowledge the reality of your life . . .that you have to live your life now. . . . The pri-mary lesson the dying teach us is to live everyday to its fullest\" (Kubler-Ross & Kessler, 2000).Caring intervention should continue to facilitatean appropriate death for the aged individual. Anticipatory grief is a process of adjustment during the course of the terminal illness that isfaced by the patient as well as by the family/caregivers. It usually begins at the time of diag-nosis, and can be caused by a variety of adjust-ments and secondary losses experienced by andrequired of the individual ( Box 22-6 ). These might include loss of control, independence,productivity, security, various abilities, predic-tability and consistency, future existence, plea-sure, ability to complete plans and projects,significant others, meaning, dreams, and hopes for the future (Rando, 1984). Persons who are facing end of life often encounter feelings of hopelessness. They may findcomfort and be helped to adjust to their changingcondition by recognizing a changing focus of hope.\"A patient can hear a terminal diagnosis and stillhave hopes for the type of life remaining\" (Rando,1984, p. 270). When a person is confronted withthe possibility of a life-ending illness, usually thefirst response is: \"I hope it's nothing serious or thatit can be easily treated without much disruptionin my life.\" As treatment is not successful and asthe illness progresses, one might hope that \"myfamily and I will have the opportunity to getthings done . . . the grand-daughter get married.\" When getting better or prolonging life is not feasible, one is often confronted with giving uphope altogether. That is how some people feelwhen they choose hospice or palliative care.That is, in fact, what some physicians implywhen they say, \"There is nothing more that canbe done for you.\" Hospice and palliative carepersonnel believe that hope can continue\u2014butthe focus of hope changes from that of gettingbetter. One can hope for the appropriate helpand support for themselves and their familiesthrough the transitions that end of life brings.They can hope that they will be provided withguidance and emotional comfort, and that theircare will be provided with respect for their dig-nity through the dying process. They can hopethat their passing will be comfortable and painfree. They can hope that their families willreceive the appropriate support before and aftertheir death. They can hope to be treated holis-tically\u2014as an individual with unique needs,wishes, and desires. Four powerful statements proposed by Ira Byock provide a clear path to emotional wellness28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 807 808 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care throughout a lifetime. They also provide a formatfor resolving some personal, emotional, and/orspiritual issues at end of life. They are: \"Please forgive . . 2004, p. 3).Spiritual IssuesSpiritual issues may or may not be related to theperson's relationship to or lack of affiliation withan organized religion. Some may find greatpeace and comfort in a religion and its practicesand rituals. Others are just as spiritual, withoutthe link to religious ties and practices, perhapsfinding comfort in nature or some other source. Spiritual and cultural rituals may be impor- tant for some people at end of life. Nurses maybe in a position to help patients and families toobtain access to the rituals that may be impor-tant as a person is nearing death ( Box 22-7 ). For some religions, this may mean obtaining appro-priate clergy for confession, communion, andanointing. For others it may mean a more gen-eral ritual for commendation of the dying. Forsome cultures, certain foods, fasting, handling ofthe body, and placement in a certain position tofacilitate burial may be important (Kirkwood,Box 22-6 There's An Elephant in The Room By Terry Kettering It has hurt us all, but we do not talk aboutThe elephant in the room.Oh, please, say her name.Oh, please, say, \"Barbara\" again.Oh, please, let's talk aboutThe elephant in the room.For if we talk about her death,Perhaps we can talk about her life.Can I say, \"Barbara\" to youAnd not have you look away?For if I cannot,Then you are leaving me alone\u2014In a room\u2014With an elephant!There's an elephant in the room.It is large and squatting, so it's hard to get around it.

As in other aspects of individualized care,it is appropriate to simply ask the patient and/orfamily about these preferences. To formalize this asking, several brief assess- ments have been developed for use by nurses toincorporate a spiritual component into their nurs-ing plan of care. These are available for detailedreview in Spiritual Care in Nursing Practice (Mauk & Schmidt, 2004). The assessments are easy toincorporate, using acronyms as reminders inobtaining the spiritual history content.

The role movesfrom a fix-it focus to that of presence\u2014theability to be with the patient and with his orher family. This presence involves the provisionof comfort measures, lending a listening ear,providing a peaceful environment, and com-passionately educating patient and family Addiction: Compulsive psychological dependence on and use of a habit-forming substance, character-ized by continued craving and well-defined physi-ological symptoms upon withdrawal; notconsidered to be an issue when using opioids forend-of-life and palliative care. Advance directives: Spoken and written instructions about future medical care and treatment; legaldocuments outlining a person's wishes for futuremedical treatments to be (or not to be) providedat some time in the future, at a time when theindividual is not able to verbalize or make his orher wishes known. These include a living will,durable power of attorney for health care, and life-prolonging procedures documents; they are onlyin effect if the individual is unable to make his orher wishes known. Analgesic ladder: World Health Organization sugges- tions for implementing increasing strengths/typesof pain medications based on increasing symp-toms. Allow Natural Death (AND): Used as an advance directive in some locations instead of a DNR (donot resuscitate) order; promotes a more positiveapproach to consideration of a person's wishes atend of life. Communicating bad news: Module 2 of Education in Palliative and End-of-Life Care (EPEC) training for medical personnel, to promote honest and com-passionate discussion about end-of-life care andoptions for treating life-ending illnesses. Glossary Complementary therapies: Interventions used in col- laboration with conventional health care interven-tions that promote comfort or healing. Curative care: Medical care focused on healing/cure of disease. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR): A physician's written order instructing health care providers not to attemptcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in case ofcardiac or respiratory arrest. Dependence: Physical response to use of opioids, char- acterized by withdrawal symptoms when the opi-oid is stopped. End of life: Last stages of living; in this context usually caused by a terminal illness. Five Wishes: An alternative advance directive that gives additional information and explanation about aperson's wishes for end-of-life care; not legally rec-ognized in all states. Grief: A natural and normal reaction to a loss of any kind. Hope: To expect with confidence. Hospice care: A program to deliver palliative care to individuals in the final stages of a terminal illness;additionally provides personal support and care tothe patient, and supports to the patient's family/caregivers while the patient is dying; providesbereavement support after the patient's death. Interdisciplinary team/group: Professional staff and volunteers who focus on physical, emotional, psy-chological, social, and spiritual aspects of a personabout the dying process. The nurse's gratifica-tion does not come from curing, but ratherfrom supporting the patient in a peaceful anddignified death. \"You matter because you are. You matter to the last moment of your life,and we will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully,but to live until you die.\"\u2014 Cicely Saunders (1984, p. 33).28438_CH22_779_814.qxd 6/6/06 5:26 PM Page 811 812 Chapter 22: End-of-Life Care in designing and/or implementing holistic care;common in hospice and palliative care and othercare settings. Mourning: The outward demonstration of a person's grief responses to a loss.

In addition to variousjob descriptions, gerontological nurses workin a variety of settings, from the communitywith well elderly to hospice with the dying,and every point in between along the contin-uum of care. A few unique possibilities in ger-ontological nursing will be discussed later inthis chapter. Educational and CareerTrends in Gerontological Nursing Opportunities in gerontological nursing aresomewhat correlated with education level. Thecommon settings for gerontological nursingpractice were discussed in Chapter 1. Many lev-els of preparation are available for nurses ingerontology. First, as has been noted through-out this text, all nurses should receive specialeducation in caring for older adults during theirbasic nursing preparation, whether at the LPN;RN associate degree; diploma RN; or RN, BSNlevel. nurse (CNS) in gerontology orgeriatric nurse practitioner (GNP) program. Inaddition, some programs offer a postmaster'sGNP certificate. There are four certifications ingerontology available from the American Asso-ciation of Colleges of Nursing (AACN). Theseare discussed in Chapter 1. Most gerontological nurses with basic prepa- ration find work in long-term care facilities suchas nursing homes, assisted living, independentliving centers, adult day care, or in an acute carehospital. Nurses who obtain a BSN and con-tinue to work in geriatrics often become unitmanagers, then assistant directors or directors ofnursing in nursing homes or other long-termcare settings. Many geriatric nurses work inhome health care and hospice, those specialitiesthat service many chronically ill and/or dyingolder adults. For advanced practice nurses , opportuni- ties for further career development are many,but often depend upon one's geographic loca-tion. Certainly larger teaching hospitals in bigcities have many more positions for gerontolog-ical clinical nurse specialists and GNPs thansmaller towns. Positions in education throughcounty hospitals or religiously affiliated healthcare systems are generally available, thoughmany CNSs and NPs have been known to carvetheir own niche, write their own job descrip-tion, and literally \"make a job for themselves\"by marketing their expertise in an area of need.Indeed there may be significant overlap in someclinical specialty areas that tend to serve a largeelderly population, such as oncology or wound/ostomy nursing, creating even more job possi-bilities. One thing is certain, the advance prac-tice nurses of today and the future will need tobe more business minded to obtain their idealdesired position. For nurses with doctoral-level education, careers as faculty members abound. The facultyshortage is acute and projected to continue.There is a tremendous need for certified andwell-prepared faculty members in gerontologi-cal nursing to teach students who will care forthe aging population. Nurses may obtain severaldoctorates that may be considered terminaldegrees, though this varies with each universityand school of nursing. The PhD (doctor of phi-losophy in nursing) and DNS (doctor of nursingscience) are currently recognized as terminalnursing degrees by most universities. The PhDis a universal research degree recognized in mostcountries. This preparation allows the holder todesign and conduct research in addition to tak-28438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 816 Potential Opportunities in Gerontological Nursing 817 ing coursework in theory, statistics, and philos-ophy. The DNP (doctor of nursing practice) isa clinical doctorate that is gaining more popu-larity in combination with obtaining certifica-tion as a nurse practitioner. It is not intended toprepare the nurse to be a researcher. Some nurs-ing faculty members hold an EdD, an educa-tional doctorate, with coursework emphasizingcurricular development and teaching. Most doc-torally prepared gerontological nurses work inacademic or research institutions, as authors,speakers, consultants, or private business own-ers. Those with the ND designation are foundmore often in collaborative practice with physi-cians in primary care settings, though somegerontological nurses have branched into reha-bilitation and outpatient clinics that deal witholder adults. In addition to all of the educational opportu- nities in nursing, many colleges and universitiesoffer majors, minors, certificates, or concentrationsin gerontology that can be taken in addition to oreven along with the nursing major. According tothe Association in Gerontology for Higher Edu-cation (AGHE), \"there are over 500 colleges anduniversities that offer more than 1,000 credit pro-grams in aging\" (2005) in some formal programs,and over 1,000 additional schools offer some typeof coursework in aging (AGHE). For nurses wish-ing to specialize in gerontology from the begin-ning of their career, additional coursework in thefield is recommended. Potential Opportunitiesin Gerontological Nursing The opportunities for nurses in geriatrics covera wide variety of educational levels and settingsfor employment. All nurses working in acutecare will care for older adults at some time, andit is estimated that about 50% of patients inhospitals are currently over 65 years of age. Thisfact is being recognized by nursing programsthroughout the world. Evidence of this is pro-vided through grants funded by the John A.Hartford Foundation to increase gerontologicalcontent in the nursing curriculum. The HartfordFoundation has provided millions of dollars infunding to promote education in both nursingand social work, particularly to prepare thesehealth care professionals to give quality care toolder adults. The AACN in cooperation withthe Hartford Foundation gives annual awards toprograms and individuals for their work ingerontological nursing. Although many nurses will find their first jobs in acute care hospitals, nurses historicallychange positions throughout their careers. Withthe projected changes in the population distri-bution to a large older cohort of baby boomers,nurses are likely to see a dramatic shift in thetypes and numbers of nonhospital opportunitiesfor career advancement. The need for clinical nurse specialists in geron- tology is likely to increase, as is the need for geri-atric nurse practitioners. Because the baby boomergeneration is known to be an autonomous, well-educated, informed consumer group, this popula-tion cohort is more likely to demand a higher levelof education and expertise among care providers.As health-conscious and savvy researchers, babyboomers will want the highest quality care fromthose with the most expertise (and for the bestvalue for their money). These trends point toadvanced practice nurses as the most valuable pro-fessionals of the upcoming older generation. Over the next decades, the health care system may experience unexpected shifts, such as morecare being provided in the home by spouses andfamily members. Nurses may be called upon to28438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 817 818 Chapter 23: Future Trends in Gerontological Nursing train family members to care for loved ones intheir home to a much greater extent than occurstoday. On the other hand, though baby boomersmay not wish to be cared for in institutions orlong-term care facilities, their children are a gen-eration that tends to be quite mobile and morefocused on meeting their own life goals thanperhaps taking care of elderly parents. If lifeexpectancy continues at its current rate or evenincreases, baby boomers may be assisted in laterlife more often by their spouses, friends, churchcommunities, and with assistive technology thanever before. The demand for better, higher quality,more personal and professional care in nursinghomes may also increase if aging baby boomers canno longer be cared for in the home environment. Indeed, there is a trend today for large churches or even groups of churches to come together tobuild and maintain their own retirement facili-ties with care ranging from independent livingto assisted living, intermediate, skilled, Alz-heimer's units, and rehabilitation. Nurses withfaith-based backgrounds may find such newventures challenging as they assist with devel-opment during the planning phase before eventhe first brick is laid. Certainly no such facilitieswould be possible without nurses, so such inter-esting ventures funded largely by donations andgifts from church members to care for their ownelderly members present exciting possibilitiesfor new nursing positions in both staff and man-agement. Facilities such as these are often moreopen to the enterprising nurse who approachesthem with his or her ideas for a new job posi-tion, such as a wellness coordinator or clinicalnurse specialist to educate staff and focus onmaintaining function and independence forolder residents. All these potential changes lead to the pos- sibility that gerontological nurses of the futurewill need to be more highly educated and havea good business sense, excellent managementskills, and greater flexibility in the workplace(Case Study 23-1 ). Nurses may be seen more often in collaborative practice to meet the grow-ing needs of greater numbers of older adults.Advanced practice nurses will become moreentrepreneurial, creating companies that spe-cialize in educating businesses, churches, organ-izations, and private health care consumersabout the aging process and how to stay healthylonger. Nurses will collaborate on a new levelwith other disciplines such as financial planners(financial geronotology) (Mauk & Mauk, 2006)and church leaders (parish nursing) to meet thevarious needs of the upcoming older health careconsumer. All of these changes make geronto-logical nursing an exciting field to be in today!In this chapter, several emerging trends withinother disciplines will be discussed in light ofhow the roles of nurses in gerontology arechanging and expanding ( Case Study 23-2 ). Life Care Planning The concept of life care planning was first devel-oped in the 1980s to meet a growing need foran informed document that presented actualestimated costs of care for persons who hadexperienced a catastrophic injury or accident.Many settlements for those persons in devastat-ing accidents were made arbitrarily withoutactual calculation and consideration of the mul-titudes of factors influencing these costs, such asdoctor's visits, equipment, medications, tests,cost of caregiving, and potential complicationsover a lifetime. Definition A life care plan is a comprehensive document designed to help meet the long-term financialand health needs of a person who has experi-28438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 818 Life Care Planning 819 enced a catastrophic injury. For example, a per-son suffering paralysis from a complete spinalcord injury as a result of a car accident may havea lawyer who uses the services of a life care plan-ner to determine as closely as possible the careneeds of the person over many years of livingwith a disability. Armed with this informationin court, and able to use the testimony of a lifecare planner, lawyers are more likely to obtainan equitable, reasonable, and necessary settle-ment for their clients. Life care planners generally develop plans for insurance companies or lawyers representingindividual clients, but the ultimate goal is topromote the best outcome for the person forwhom the life care plan was written ( Case Study 23-3). The best life care planners have a nearly equal mix between work for insurance carriersand work for lawyers who present patients, thusmaintaining a neutral and professional reputa-tion for fairness. It is common for there to bemuch give and take in the discussion of arrivingat a fair monetary settlement for the patient whohas been the victim of a catastrophic accident.Life care planners research, analyze, compile,and present the facts in a comprehensive, bal-anced document that details all of the expensesthat a person with catastrophic injury may incur2.

Software pro-grams are available that help manage the dataobtained from various sources, including physi-cians, pharmacists, nurses, the patient, family,and other team members. Certification The designation of Certified Life Care Planner (CLCP) may be earned through 128 continuing education hours, successful completion of a sam-ple life care plan, and passing an examination(MediPro Seminars, 2004). Table 23-1 gives anexample of some of the topics for life care plan-ning certification. The CNLCP (Certified Nurse Life Care Planner) designation is offered by the AmericanAssociation of Nurse Life Care Planners Certifi-cation Board (AANLCPCB). It is similar to theCLP , but with additional requirements, and isdefinitely designed for registered nurses with casemanagement experience (Professional TestingCorporation, 2004).

How could Terry combine his prior knowledge in sportsCase Study 23-228438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 820 Life Care Planning 821 certification demonstrates that the life care plan-ner is a seasoned registered nurse. Conversely, theCLCP designation may be earned by any varietyof professionals or nonprofessionals, includingfinancial planners and lay persons who meet thecriteria. To recertify in either of these certifica-tions requires a certain number of continuingeducation hours as well as practice hours and re-newal fees within a certain number of years, aswith most such designations. Future Potential Life care planning may be a concept that will becarried into the senior population. Not only areseniors living longer, but they continue in higherrisk activities today than in generations past. Therate of catastrophic accidents formerly consideredto be prevalent among younger adults may nowbe seen with older adults in activities such asmotorcycle riding, horseback riding, skiing, andcontinuing to operate automobiles and othermachinery well into late life. This also placesolder adults at risk of requiring the services of alife care planner at some time in their life. Although originally designed for those with catastrophic illness or accident, the principles oflife care planning could also easily be extrapo-lated for use with those seniors who have long-term chronic health problems. Although a goodfinancial planner could provide a comprehensivefinancial life plan that takes health status intoaccount, a life care planner could provide a moreaccurate and detailed projection of health carecosts over a lifetime of disability or illness. Questions:1. Is the use of a life care planner a good suggestion in the case ofMr. Lopez? 2. How might the expertise of a life care planner help Mr. Lopezin the long run? 3. What types of information would a life care planner askfor? 4. What information does the life care planner provide to theattorney, courts, and insurancecompanies? Mr. Lopez is an active 72-year-old male who recently sustained a completeC4 spinal cord injury as a result of amotorcycle accident. Mr. Lopez and hisfamily are seeking damages from theinsurance company of the person in thevehicle who hit Mr. Lopez while he wasriding his motorcycle. Mr. Lopezexhibits quadriplegia and is expected toneed a great deal of care and rehabili-tation. His rehabilitation nurse suggeststhe services of a life care planner toassist Mr. Lopez and his attorney indevising a plan to cover his expectedcosts over the rest of his lifetime.Case Study 23-328438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 821 822 Chapter 23: Future Trends in Gerontological Nursing As the population ages, so does the incidence of chronic illnesses and disease. The demand forprofessionals in gerontology and rehabilitationis likely to grow quickly with the aging babyboomer group. Gerontological nurses are in aunique position to combine their knowledge inhealth care with some financial training to offerdistinctive services to the older age group. A lifecare plan allows individuals to prepare for thelikely impact of their health condition over theirlifespan and to plan accordingly. \"In the areas offinance, economics, and marketing, new trendsare being seen that combine the expertise offinancial planners with health care advisors andadvocates for seniors\" (Mauk & Mauk, 2006, p.2). The baby boomer generation, as has beennoted, is made up of conscious and conscientioushealth consumers who are informed, educated,thrifty, and autonomous. The life care planningmarket may be an area for exponential growthin the next decades. Financial Gerontology Financial gerontology is a growing subfield of financial planning. Financial gerontology isdefined as \"the intellectual intersection of twofields, gerontology and finance, each of whichhas practitioner and academic 2004, p. 29). Mauk and Mauk (2006)stated \"financial gerontology combines theknowledge and skills associated with financialplanning and asset management with expertisein meeting the unique needs of older adults\" (p. 4). This emerging market presents excellentopportunities for gerontological nurses who alsohave an interest in finances and health care deci-sion making. Three certifications will be dis-cussed here: Chartered Advisor , Registered tologist (RFG) , and Certified Senior Advisor (CSA) . Many graduate nursing programs are now offering dual degrees of Master in BusinessAdministration (MBA) and Master of Science inNursing (MSN). These educational trends sup-port the idea that there is a growing need forhealth care professionals such as nurses to be edu-cated beyond traditional health-related science. Chartered Advisor for SeniorLiving (CASL) The CASL (a designation obtainable from TheAmerican College) \"is a financial service profes-sional who is uniquely qualified to work withmature clients and those planning for retire-ment\" (The American College, 2005, p. 2). Aperson with a CASL certification assists olderTable 23-1 Examples of Topic Areas for the Life Care Planning Examinations Life care planning principles Case management principles Medical interventions and complications associated with medical conditions: Traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury,burns, amputations, common pediatric andneonatal disabilities, chronic pain, AIDS,cancer, orthopedic injuries, other complexdisabilities, vocational tools Interdisciplinary team Legal/ethical issues Legislation Measurement and statistics Psychological issues Life care planning charts28438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 822 Financial Gerontology 823 persons with retirement savings, pension andsocial security planning, health and long-termcare issues, estate planning, and \"managing lifecourse transitions, family relationship and liv-ing arrangements\" (The American College, p. 3).This designation is appropriate for persons whowork with older adults, including financialplanners, case managers, accountants, attorneys,long-term care specialists, and nurses ( Case Study 23-4 ). Gerontological nurses, both at the basic preparation level and those in advancedpractice, already have some basis of expertisethrough education and experience that wouldmake obtaining this certification more mean-ingful. Although the content on aging would befamiliar to most nurses, the financial aspect ofthe certification is challenging if one does nothave an accounting or business background. To earn the CASL designation, a person must successfully complete five courses that takeapproximately 60-80 hours of study each. Aftereach course, the individual must pass a com-puterized exam. Maintenance of the certificationis comparable to most nursing certifications, Questions: 1. Given George's situation, what options are available to him toincrease his knowledge aboutfinancial advising for older adults? 2. What might be the best program to fit George's needs and goals? 3. Which programs are most costly?4. Which programs require the most investment of George's time? 5. Does George even need a special credential to start his smallbusiness? 6. What are the benefits and disad- vantages of George obtaining adesignation or certification inone of the areas discussed in thischapter? George is a 56-year-old male prepar- ing to retire from a career in privatebusiness. He notices that many of hisfriends, some much older than he, havemade little or no plans for financialsecurity after retirement. These friendsoften come to George for advice onfinances, but he feels ill-prepared togive them an opinion on things relatedto the senior market and the possibili-ties for investments and retirementplanning. After his retirement, Georgethinks he would like to have a smallhome business to advise seniors onfinancial matters, but he feels he wouldneed additional training and does notwish to spend a lot of time or money\"tinkering\" with this business afterretirement.Case Study 23-428438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 823 824 Chapter 23: Future Trends in Gerontological Nursing with continuing education credits required. Acode of ethics must also be agreed to in writingprior to being granted the designation. Registered FinancialGerontologist (RFG) The Registered Financial Gerontologist (RFG)certification is a similar designation to theCASL, but is offered through The AmericanInstitute of Financial Gerontology and sup-ported by the American Society on Aging(American Institute of Financial Gerontology,2004). To earn this certification, individualsmust complete six courses, a learning require-ment, and a comprehensive examination. Coursecontent is related to wealth span planning,ethics, and serving the older client. Comparedto the CASL courses, the curriculum appearsmore suited to gerontologists than financialplanners. This should be kept in mind whenchoosing the most appropriate designation for anurse's career planning. Certified Senior Advisor (CSA) The Certified Senior Advisor (CSA) is a desig-nation offered by the Society of Senior Advisors.There are currently 17,000 persons in theUnited States with this certification. The cur-riculum includes a large number of topics inaging, chronic illness, end-of-life, and long-termcare as well as Medicaid and financial planning(Society of Certified Senior Advisors, 2005). Itis a self-study program that takes 2-6 monthsto complete. To obtain the CSA, the personmust also pass a secured, computerized, finalcomprehensive examination online that consistsof 150 multiple choice questions within 3 hours(Society of Certified Senior Advisors).Long-Term Care Each of the certifications discussed in this chap-ter prepare persons to help the elderly withlong-term care needs. Long-term care is \"thebroad range of medical, custodial, social, andother care services that assist people who havean impaired ability to live independently for anextended period\" (Beam & O'Hare, 2003, p. 3).The National Council on Aging (2005) esti-mates that 6.4 million people over the age of 65and 50% of those over age 85 will need long-term care. Thirteen million persons in theUnited States currently report having long-termhealth care needs. This number is expected togrow to 22 million in the next two decades(Chiappelli, Koepke, & Cherry, 2005). Personsmust pay for many long-term care expensesfrom their savings and assets, or spend downtheir financial assets before being eligible forMedicaid. This has prompted new sources offunding for future long-term health care needs. Long-Term Care Insurance Long-term care insurance is designed to cover individuals needing health care outside of thehospital, including diagnostics testing, rehabil-itation, and custodial care. Reasons for purchas-ing long-term care insurance include worryingabout being a burden to their family, stayingfinancially independent, having more choices forcare if needed (such as remaining in the home),preserving their assets, and providing peace ofmind (United Seniors Health Council, 2005)(Case Study 23-5 ). The cost of long-term care insurance premi- ums (at age 65) ranges from $1,000-$2,650 peryear, depending upon a number of factorsincluding health status and history. The average28438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 824 Long-Term Care 825 nurse's grandparents. Howlikely are they to use these ser-vices, given their medical back-ground and ages? 2. What could the grandparents expect to pay out of pocket ifthey must both go to a nursinghome? 3. What are some strategies for planning for care of these per-sons as they enter advanced agewith chronic diseases?A nurse has a grandmother who was recently diagnosed with diabetes. Untilnow, she has been relatively healthy.Her grandmother has been looking intolong-term care insurance because she isafraid that either she or her husband of45 years (who has a family history ofAlzheimer's disease) may need nursinghome care at some point in their livesand she does not wish to exhaust all oftheir savings. Questions: 1. Describe the benefits of long- term care insurance for theCase Study 23-5 cost for a private room in a nursing home in2003 was $181.24/day (National Council onAging, 2005). The average stay in a nursinghome is 2 years with an estimated cost of$50,000 per year or more, and this is projectedto increase to $200,000 per year by 2030 (Beam& O'Hare, 2003). Long-term care insurance can be purchased at any time, but premiums increase with age.Long-term care insurance may cover any one orall of the following types of care (Beam &O'Hare, 2003): Nursing home care Assisted living Hospice12 Home health Adult day care Respite Caregiver training Home health care coordinators A comprehensive policy is probably the best option for anyone who anticipates the possibil-ity of needing several levels of care throughoutthe lifespan. Depending upon what the indi-vidual wishes to pay, benefits may be calculateddaily with limits ranging generally from$50-$500 per day. Monthly benefits may varygreatly, from $1,000-$6,000 per month. Nurses should be informed about the possi- bility of clients having or obtaining long-term28438_CH23_815_828.qxd 6/6/06 5:27 PM Page 825 826 Chapter 23: Future Trends in Gerontological Nursing care insurance. This is a question nurses shouldask of any long-term care patient. Some personswithout informed family members may not real-ize they have this type of coverage, and thosewith newly diagnosed conditions that will even-tually require long-term care may benefit fromearlier investment in this type of insurance.Currently, only 5 million people have long-termcare insurance, but there are now 120 companiesthat offer this type of insurance (Beam &O'Hare, 2003). Ultimately, the decision to pur-chase long-term care insurance rests with thepatient and family, but gerontological nursesshould be prepared to answer basic questionsabout the benefits and disadvantages of pur-chasing such policies.

Are any of the certifications discussed in this chapter new to you? Would you ever be interested in combining your nursing knowledge in gerontology with some type of finan-cial planning? 2. What would it take for you to obtain a certification or designation in one of the areas discussed here? Is this something that you might like to do in the future? If you werestarting your own business and offering services to older adults, which of these certifi-cations would be of most interest to you? 3. What do you think about long-term care insurance? Will you think about purchasing it when you are middle aged? Old aged? Why or why not? 4. What information from this chapter is useful to you as you think about working as a nurse with older adults?Critical Thinking Exercises 1. Explore the suggested Web sites for this chapter and consider the various options for obtaining certifications related to gerontology and finances. 2. Find a law student or an attorney who would informally discuss with you the advan- tages and disadvantages of using a life care planner in obtaining the desired settle-ment for a person who sustained a catastrophic injury as the result of someone else'snegligence. 3. Surf the World Wide Web for life care planners. Check out the educational background and experience of those offering these services. How many are nurses? What are theircredentials? What are their Web sites like? Do they offer any other services? 4. Call an insurance company and inquire about long-term care insurance. What are the monthly premiums for a healthy 60 year old versus a 75 year old with diabetes? Whendoes long-term health care insurance become a burden versus an asset? 5. Look at the Web site www.geronurseonline.com.
