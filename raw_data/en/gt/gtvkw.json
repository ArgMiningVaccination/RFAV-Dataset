Acupuncture unblocks the body's natural flow of energy. The human body has a natural flowing electromagnetic field or qi. Qi flows through channels known as meridians. Each Meridian brings energy to or away from 1 of 12 organ systems. When an acupuncture needle is inserted into a specific pressure point, the energy blockage is removed, and the natural flow of qi is promoted throughout the body. Although, needles are inserted into soft tissue, acupuncture is far less invasive than many commonplace medical procedures. Acupuncture doesn't force our bodies to change. It simply allows our body to naturally rebalance the flow of energy in each organ system. "}
