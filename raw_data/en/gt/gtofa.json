This initiative, called Next Level Programs of Study (NLPS), aims to improve the consis tency, quality, and intentionality of CTE programs throughout Indiana. To avoid confusion and to help with the transition to NLPS courses, the CTE portion of the Course Titles and Descriptions has been divided into two separate sections. The first section includes all the new NLPS courses, including capstone courses and recently developed pathways like Vet Car eers, Dental Careers, Computer Science, and Radio and TV Broadcasting, that have been developed over the last two years. The first section also includes Perkins IV (previously existing) courses that are expected to be maintained through the transition to NLPS , like introductory, foundational, and nonstandard CTE courses . The second section includes a ll of the Perkins IV (previously existin g) courses that will be phased out after the 2023 -2024 school year . Additional Changes in the Course Titles and Description: Most of the Perkins IV level I courses have been reduced from a maximum of 3 credits per semester to a maximum of 1 credit per semester. The Perkins IV level II courses will be reduced to 1 credit per semester for the 2023 -24 school year. Questions regarding Indiana's CTE system can be directed to CTE@gov.IN.gov or may be answered in the NLPS FAQ Document . Please visit the CTE Programs of Study webpage to view additional NLPS resources.
