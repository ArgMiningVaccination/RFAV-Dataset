Funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) increased with the advent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The purpose of this study was to define FQHC service areas based on patient use and examine the characteristics of areas that gained FQHC access post-ACA. The researchers first defined FQHC service areas using total patient counts by ZIP code from the Uniform Data System (UDS) and then compared that approach with other methods. The authors then compared the characteristics of ZIP codes from Medically Underserved Areas/ Populations (MUA/Ps) that gained access to FQHCs between 2011-2015, with MUA/P ZIP codes that did not gain access to FQHCs during that same time period. The study found that FQHC service areas based on the UDS data included a larger percentage of FQHC patients and a higher use of FQHCs among low-income residents, on average, than Primary Care Service Areas or counties. The researchers also discovered that MUA/Ps that gained access to an FQHC between 2011 and 2015 included more poor, publicly insured, uninsured, and foreign born residents than underserved areas that did not gain access. The study concluded that measures of actual patient use are a useful method of assessing FQHC service areas and access. AHRQ-funded; HS025378. Citation: Behr CL, Hull P, Hsu J .

The timely and effective administration of sepsis treatment may improve sepsis outcomes, and those improvements may provide evidence of the need for mandated reporting of adherence to sepsis care protocol. The purpose of the study was to better understand the association between patient-to-nurse staffing ratios, sepsis protocol compliance, and patient outcomes. The researchers conducted a cross-sectional study utilizing linked data from 537 hospitals from across California, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York (representing 252,699 Medicare inpatients with sepsis present on admission), nurse and hospital surveys, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare and the corresponding MedPAR patient claims. The study found that every additional patient per nurse was associated with greater odds of mortality, readmission, ICU admission, and greater risk of relative duration of stay. Every 10% increase in compliance of sepsis protocol was only associated with a shorter duration of stay. The study concluded that improvements in nurse staffing and the nurse-to-patient ratios had a greater impact on sepsis infection outcomes than compliance with protocols. AHRQ-funded; HS026232.

H, Raimann JG Combined effects of air pollution and extreme heat events among ESKD patients within the Northeastern United States. Researchers investigated the impact of air pollution exposure among end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients and its potential modifying effect from extreme heat events (EHE). Data on daily all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital admissions was taken from Fresenius Kidney Care records from selected northeastern US counties. Their findings suggested interdependent effects of EHE and air pollution among ESKD patients for all-cause mortality risks. They recommended national level assessments in order to consider the ESKD population as a sensitive population and to inform treatment protocols during extreme heat and degraded pollution episodes.

This study's aim was to prepare for implementation of PatientToc, a patient-reported outcomes (PRO) data collection software that can be used to help facilitate resolution of non-adherence to medications. The study was a two-phase operation, but this report focuses on the phase of the evaluation which was conducted at primary care practices currently using PatientToc and community pharmacies in Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. One-day site visits were conducted along with observations, audio-recorded contextual inquires, semi-structured interviews with staff and patients, and post-visit site observation debriefs. Nine pharmacies, two primary care practices, and 89 individuals participated. Four major barriers, four major facilitators and 14 recommendations were identified. A stakeholder panel engaged in four Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) implementation process sessions. The panel confirmed findings and designated high priority recommendations which included: explaining PatientToc and its benefits clearly and simply to patients, ensuring patients can complete questionnaires within 10 minutes, providing hands-on training/resources for pharmacy teams, and providing feedback on the adapted PatientToc application, and finalizing toolkit items for initial community OA, Curran for the spread of patient-reported outcome (PRO) data collection from primary care to community pharmacy: a mixed-methods study.

The authors assessed how the limited supply of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) therapy was allocated to patients at highest risk of severe disease. They found that, among non-hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with a COVID-19 diagnosis between November 2020 and August 2021, only 7.2% received mAb therapy. In many cases, patients at the highest risk of severe disease were the least likely to receive mAb therapy, with extreme variation geographically. Their analysis did not account for patient vaccination status or observed disease severity, which could influence clinicians' decisions.

This study's objective was to assess the value of maintaining face mask use indoors according to different COVID-19 vaccination coverage levels in the US. This computational simulation-model study used a Monte Carlo simulation model representing the US population and SARS CoV-2 spread. The investigation found that maintaining face mask use until and a short time after achieving various final vaccination coverage levels can not only be cost-effective, but even cost saving. In all scenarios, it was estimated cost-effective to maintain face mask use for about 2-10 weeks beyond the date of target vaccination coverage achievement. HS028165.

The purpose of this study was to observe and describe the development and feasibility of a multidisciplinary approach to caring for acute kidney injury (AKI) survivors at care transitions (ACT). The studied population were adults with stage 3 AKI who were not discharging on dialysis and were established with a primary care provider at the authors' academic medical center in the U.S. Preliminary data indicated that AKI survivors of interest could primarily be identified, educated, and followed up with using the multidisciplinary approach model, which also maximized the unique expertise of each team member. The authors concluded that this multidisciplinary ACT workflow supported by clinical decision support was feasible, scalable, and addressed gaps in existing care transition models.

This article discusses the challenges in applying existing guidelines for mitigating algorithmic bias in a machine learning (ML) and/or artificial intelligence (AI) tool for real-world clinical decisions making by physicians and patients. The authors then discuss the existing legal regulation of ML/AI racial bias and future directions. Their team developed a decision support framework for patients with severe heart failure that includes a prognostic ML algorithm to calculate personalized estimates for patients about their likely outcomes after receiving a left ventricular-assist device (LVAD). Their goal is to identify the potential for racial bias in the tool's algorithm identified practical challenges regarding algorithmic bias that other developers may face. The algorithms' training data base was examined to review data quality. The authors also examined other comorbidities and their role in predicting LVAD outcomes. Existing and proposed initiatives to address algorithmic bias through regulation is also discussed in detail. The authors, who are mostly bioethics experts recommend that developers seeking to mitigate bias in ML use their algorithms as leverage to call upon stakeholders who are responsible for generating relevant datasets to make a concerted effort to document race and associated variables to enable systematic inquiries into sources of potential racial bias.

Existing research indicates that patient and family engagement (PFE) in health care is necessary for improving outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the evidence on PFE strategies for adults with chronic conditions and identify the areas where additional research is needed. The authors searched existing databases, including CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and PubMed, for data between January 2015 and September 2021, to identify systematic reviews on strategies for engaging patients with chronic conditions. The study also included their caregivers. Strategies were categorized into the following levels: direct patient care, health system, and community-policy. The authors discovered 131 reviews of direct patient care strategies, 5 reviews of health system strategies, and no reviews of community-policy strategies. The study concluded that there is much more available evidence on the effects of direct patient care strategies on PFE than on the effects of the health system or community policy strategies. In addition, the evidence map created by the researchers focused on reviews which did not provide details of individual chronic disease interventions. The authors concluded that the evidence map created provides awareness of the research gaps related to efforts to improve patient and family engagement for patients with chronic conditions.

This analysis examined the relationship between contraceptive method and sex life satisfaction. Eligible participants were individuals in the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative who switched contraceptive methods and continued their new method for at least 1 month and completed all relevant surveys. Primary predictor variables included changes in sexual functioning, sexual satisfaction, and perceived impact of the contraceptive method of sex life at one month. The sample included 1879 individuals. At 3 months 52.1% of participants were completely satisfied with their contraceptive method, 30.7% were somewhat satisfied, and 6.2% were completely dissatisfied. Patients at 3 months who said the method improved their sex life \"a lot\" had 7.7 times increased odds of greater satisfaction at 3 months than patients who said their contraceptive method made their sex life \"a lot\" worse at 1 month. Patients whose method improved their sex life a \"little\" had 5.88 times increased odds of greater satisfaction. Experiencing less or no vaginal bleeding was significantly associated with increased satisfaction. AHRQ-funded; HS027220. Citation: Kramer RD, Higgins JA, Everett B .

A prospective, dermatology practice-based study was performed of adults with atopic dermatitis. Using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), regression models were constructed to examine itch over time. In repeated-measures regression models, persistent NRS average-itch scores were associated with baseline NRS average-itch and food allergy. Persistent NRS worst-itch was associated with baseline worst-itch NRS and Medicaid insurance. Patients with atopic dermatitis had a heterogeneous longitudinal course with fluctuating and complex overlapping patterns of average- and worst-itch intensity, and frequency. AHRQ-funded; HS023011.

Arch Dermatol Res 2022 Sun DS, Kissler SM, Kanjilal S Analysis of multiple bacterial species and antibiotic classes reveals large variation in the association between seasonal antibiotic use and resistance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the seasonal use of 5 classes of antibiotics (penicillins, macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and nitrofurans) and antibiotic resistance across 3 species of bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study found seasonal peaks in use which varied by class, with resistance in all 9 species-antibiotic combinations peaking in the spring and winter. Resistance to all antibiotic classes had the highest correlation with the use of the macrolides and penicillins which were the winter peaking classes. The researchers concluded that antibiotic use strategies will not be equally effective across all species and all antibiotics, but instead selection for resistance across antibiotic classes may be governed by penicillins and macrolides, the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics.

Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles among neonatal early-onset sepsis pathogens. This retrospective review examined antimicrobial susceptibility of infants 22 weeks' gestation who were cared for in Neonatal Research Network centers April 2015-March 2017. Nonsusceptibility was defined as intermediate or resistant on treatment results. The authors identified 239 pathogens (235 bacteria, 4 fungi) in 235 EOS cases among 217,480 live-born infants. Antimicrobial susceptibility data was available for 79.1% of isolates. All 81 Gram-positive isolates with ampicillin and gentamicin were susceptible in vitro. Among Gram-negative isolates with ampicillin and gentamicin susceptibility data, to gentamicin, and 7.3% isolates were nonsusceptible to both. The authors estimated that overall 8% of EOS cases were caused by isolates nonsceptible to ampicillin and gentamicin and were most likely to occur among preterm, very-low birth weight infants.

The authors studied quality of life (QOL) and psychological health following treatment for uterine fibroids (UFs). Using data from the COMPARE-UF registry, they found that UF symptoms were more severe among women reporting anxiety/depression at baseline. At the 1-year follow-up, health-related QOL scores improved among all women and the prevalence of anxiety/depression decreased in most, but not all, women. However, the severity of anxiety/depression worsened in a small percentage of women. AHRQ-funded; HS023418. Citation: Wallace K, Stewart EA, Wise LA .

Assessing proximate intermediates between ambient temperature, hospital admissions, and mortality in hemodialysis patients. This study investigated whether pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (preSBP) and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) in individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) can independently mediate the association between ambient temperature, all-cause hospital admissions (ACHA), and all-cause mortality (ACM). The study population consisted of 1981 ESKD patients receiving hemodialysis treatments at Fresenius Medical Care facilities in Philadelphia County, PA, from 2011 to 2019. Within a time-to-event framework, the authors estimated the association between daily maximum dry-bulb temperature (TMAX) and, as separate models, ACHA and ACM during warmer calendar months. Based on Lag 2- Lag 1 temporal ordering, and a 1 \u00b0C increase in daily maximum dry-bulb temperature (TMAX), the authors found an increased hazard of ACHA by 1.4% and ACM 7.5%. Short-term lag exposures to 1 \u00b0C increase in temperature predicted mean reductions in IDWG al..
