Causes | || || | | | Contamination of water | | Infected chicken | | Paramyxovirus - Paramyxovirus type1 (PMV-1 belongs to the genus Avulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae). - Based on the disease produced in chickens, NDVs have been classified into five pathotypes, namely Viscerotropic velogenic (most pathogenic), Neurotropic velogenic, Mesogenic (moderate pathogenic), Lentogenic9 low pathogenic) and Asymptamatic. - Various physical (heat, irradiation and pH effects) and chemical compounds (potassium permanganate, formalin, ethanol, etc.) could destroy the virus. - Fumigation of buildings and incubators can be used to kill the virus. - Infected chickens are the primary source of virus. - Virus is shed during incubation, during the clinical stage, and for a varying but limited period during convalescence. - Virus may also be present in eggs laid during clinical disease and in all parts of the carcass during acute virulent infections. - Infected birds shed virus in exhaled air, respiratory discharges, and feces, etc. which contaminate feed and water. - Infection in birds occurs through inhalation and ingestion of contaminated materials. - Wild and pet birds, movement of people and poultry equipment and even poultry products could aid in spread of infection. - The virus has been found to survive for several days on the mucous membrane of the human respiratory tract and has been isolated from sputum. Clinical symptoms - Twisting of neck and paralysis of wings and legs - Cyanosis of comb - Facial edema - Diarrhoea - Drop in egg production - Sudden death Gross lesions - Haemorrhage in intestine - Petechial haemorrhage in proventiculus - Congestion and mucoid exudates seen in the respiratory tract, especially in trachea. Prevention and control - Disease can be prevented effectively by an integrated approach of vaccination, proper management and strict biosecurity. - Live virus vaccines both from lentogenic (La Sota, F, B1) and mesogenic (H, R2B, Mukteshwar) strains are used for induction of good immune response. - Healthy chicks are vaccinated as early as day 1-4 of life. - Lentogenic strains are administered through ocular (eye) or nasal (nostril) route for primary vaccination of birds. - Mesogenic strains are administered through subcutaneous or intramuscular route at 6-8 weeks of age as secondary vaccine for better protection of longer duration. - Killed vaccine with oil adjuvant are used in endemic areas and administered intramuscularly/ subcutaneously to maintain high and prolonged antibody titre in layers and breeders and better maternal antibodies in chicks. - Recommended vaccination schedule for layers: | | Age in days | | Name of the vaccine | | Route | | 5 | | F/B | | I/o (or) I/n | | 27 | | LaSota | | water | | 52 | | LaSota | | Water | | 64 | | R2B | | I/m | || || | | | 112 | | LaSota | | water | | 280 | | LaSota | | water - Regular disinfection of farm premises and equipment with potassium permanganate (1: 1000), sodium hydroxide (2%) or Lysol (1: 5,000) are useful in preventing this disease. [TOP](Disease Control And Management.html) Marek's Disease (MD) Nature of disease | || || | | | 12-24 weeks of age chicken susceptible to Marek's disease | | Contagious viral disease of poultry | | Gallid herpes virus - It is highly contagious viral disease of poultry characterized by enlargement of nerves and internal organs. - It has great economic significance. Causes | || || | | | Beetles | | Droppings | | Herpes virus - Herpes virus causes this disease. - Virus can survive at 370C for 24 hrs and in poultry house, droppings, litter, dust, feather follicles and dander for several weeks or months. - Virus can be inactivated by common chemical disinfectants within 10 minutes of treatment as well as with high humidity. - The virus matures into a fully infective, envelope form in the epithelium of the feather follicle, from which it is released into the environment. - It may survive for months in poultry house litter or dust. Dust or dander from infected chickens is particularly effective in transmission. - Transmission occurs by direct and indirect contacts by air- borne route (aerosols) and inhalation of infective materials mainly dust containing epithelial cells of feather follicles and dander. - Once the virus is introduced into a chicken flock, regardless of vaccination status, infection spreads quickly from bird to bird. - Infected chickens continue to be carriers for long periods and act as sources of infectious virus. Shedding of infectious virus can be reduced, but not prevented, by prior vaccination. - Infective materials can also be transmitted through fomites, personnel and beetles. - Virus is not transmitted through eggs. - The incidence of Marek's disease is quite variable in commercial flocks and depends on strain and dose of virus, age at exposure, maternal antibody, host gender and genetics, other concurrent diseases, and several environmental factors including stress. Clinical symptoms | || || | | | Enlarged feather folliclees | | Leg paralysis | | Lymphoid tumours in internal organs - Disease appears in two distinct forms, viz. acute and classical form. - Lameness or paralysis around 12 weeks of age may be indicative of this disease. - Acute form is manifested with sudden deaths due to formation of lymphomas in the visceral organs. - Birds may show depression, anaemia, anorexia, emaciation and weight loss, diarrhoea, etc. - Younger birds from 4 weeks onwards (mostly 6 to 10 weeks) generally suffer from this form and mortality may go as high as 60%. - Classical form involves lesions in the nerves of birds above 12 weeks with 10-30% mortality occurring over a long period. - Commonly, there is in coordination, lameness, partial or complete paralysis of wings and legs with birds unable to stand. - A transient paralysis syndrome (unilateral leg paresis) has been associated with Marek's disease, causing a characteristic posture of one leg held forward and the other held backward as lesions progress. - Stretching of legs and wings due to paralysis in either direction will give common appearance of split leg in the disease. - Twisting of neck (torticollis) results from involvement of cervical nerves and paralysis and dilatation of crop results from involvement of vagus nerves. - Blindness may also occur due to unilateral or bilateral ocular involvement. Gross lesions - Diffuse or nodular lymphoid tumors may be seen in various organs, particularly the liver, spleen, gonads, heart, lung, kidney, muscle, and proventriculus. - Enlarged nerves are one of the most consistent gross lesions in affected birds. - Enlarged feather follicles commonly termed skin leukosis may be noted. Prevention and control | || || | | | Biosecurity | | Sanitation | | Vaccination - Vaccination is the one of the most exploited and economical ways of Marek's Disease control and solid immunity develops after 7 days of vaccination. - Recommended vaccination schedule for layers: | | Age in days | | Name of vaccine | | Route | | 0 | | MD (Bivalent) | | S/C | | 7-10 | | MD (Bivalent) | | S/C - Now days, in ovo vaccination (in 18 days old embryo) are done with automated technology in many developed countries. - Procurement of stocks from Marek's Disease resistant sources followed by regular testing for Marek's Disease. - All-in-and-all-out policy of rearing the stocks minimizes the chances of disease in vaccinated flocks by breaking the infection cycle with disinfection. - Strict biosecurity along with adequate hygiene and sanitation in addition to vaccination are essential for prevention of the disease. - After outbreaks, premises should be disinfected with 5% formalin and kept without stocks for at least one month.

Causes | || || | | | Drinking water contaminated by discharge | | Homophiles paragallinarum | | Older bird suffers more - This disease is caused by a bacteria, Homophiles paragallinarum - Older bird suffers more severely. - Clinically affected and carrier birds act as a main source for disease. - It can be transmitted by drinking water contaminated by nasal discharge as well as by airborne means over a short distance. - Lateral transmission occurs readily by direct contact. - Factors that predispose to more severe and prolonged disease (chronic respiratory disease) include intercurrent infections with microorganisms such as infectious bronchitis virus, Laryngotracheitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Escherichia coli or Pasteurella spp. and unfavorable environmental conditions. - Economic losses are due to marked reduction in egg production (10-40%) in layer. Clinical symptoms | || || | | | 01 Swelling and cyanosis of eyelids and face | | 02 Swelling and cyanosis of eyelids and face | | 03 Swelling and cyanosis of eyelids and face - The disease in flocks on deep litter management is characterized by rapid spread, high morbidity and low mortality. - First typical symptoms include sneezing, mucus -like discharge from the opening of the nose, eyes, and swelling on the face(facial oedema) - In severe case conjunctivitis with closed eyes, swollen wattles, and difficulty in breathing can be seen. - Feed and water consumption is usually decreased resulting in a drop in egg production. Gross lesions | | | | Infraorbital sinus showing consolidated caseous exudate - Catarrhal to fibrino-purulent inflammation of the nasal passages and infraorbital sinus and conjunctivae. - As the disease becomes chronic or other pathogens become involved, the sinus exudates may become consolidated and turn yellowish. - Subcutaneous edema of the face and wattles is prominent. - The upper trachea may be involved, but the lungs and air sacs are only affected in chronic complicated cases Prevention and control - Prevention of infection into the farm is the best control, which could be achieved by hygiene, sanitation, strict bio security and procurement of birds from disease free sources. - Since recovered birds are reservoir of infection, such birds should be removed and culled from the flock. - All - in - all- out rearing system is required for eradication of disease. - Vaccination using inactivated whole culture of organisms containing an adjuvant can protect chickens against the disease. - In endemic areas, two doses of vaccine, each of which must consist of at least 108 colony-forming units are advocated, given subcutaneously, the first at about 16 weeks of age. Another one is given at 20 weeks of age. - After cleaning, disinfection and resting of the building for at least 1 week, new birds may be introduced. - Only day-old chickens or older birds which are known to be free from H.

Causes | || || | | | Avipoxvirus | | Overcrowding | | Through vaccination virus transfer from one to another - Disease is caused by an avipoxvirus, which is relatively resistant to common disinfecting procedures and can survive in dried scab for years. - Virus does not penetrate intact skin. Some break in the skin is required for the virus to enter the epithelial cells, replicate and cause disease. - Disease spreads mechanically through direct contact, where contaminated materials soil the abraded/lacerated skin, by mosquitoes and other biting insects. - In a contaminated environment, aerosols (droplets) generated from feather follicles and dried scabs carry the virus and spread the disease. - It can be transmitted by the respiratory tract. - During vaccination, the individuals may transfer the virus from affected to healthy birds. - Deposition of virus in eyes, through lachrymal duct it goes to larynx and causes upper respiratory tract infection. - Disease is frequently observed during rainy and winter seasons with persisting overcrowding and unhygienic conditions. - Disease remains a problem for a long time, in farms where multiple age birds are maintained, even after preventive vaccinations. Clinical symptoms | || || | | | Wart like gowth in the non-feathered parts of the body | | Wart like gowth in the non-feathered parts of the body | | Wart like gowth in the non-feathered parts of the body - This disease is manifested clinically in one of the two forms, cutaneous or diphtheritic or both. - Poor weight gain and drop in egg production in layers is always significant. - In cutaneous form (dry pox), lesions in the form of scab appears on the comb, wattles, eyelids, external nares, corner of the beak and other non-feathered parts of the body. - Lesions on eye may affect the bird's vision or close both eyes affecting the ability of the bird to reach feed and water leading to starvation and deaths. - Papule \u2014> vesicles In cutaneous form, flock mortality is usually low rarely exceeding 25%. - In diphtheritic form (wet pox or fowl diphtheria), initially small nodules are formed on the mucous membrane of mouth, oesophagus and trachea. - Later on, these nodules become yellow cheesy in nature, thereby, forming a diphtheritic membrane on these organs causing obstruction, interference with feeding and difficulty in breathing with mortality up to 50%. Gross lesions | | | | fowl pox gross - Lesions initially start as nodular area with blanched appearance (papule) - It becomes enlarged and yellowish (pustules) terminating into thick, dark scab. Prevention and control | || | | | Disinfection of premises | | Sanitation - Two types of vaccines (pigeon pox and fowl pox vaccines) can be used for vaccination. - Pigeon pox vaccine is less pathogenic and can be used on chickens at any stage by wing web method and it produces immunity for 6 months therefore revaccination is required. - Fowl pox vaccine produces solid immunity, usually carried out at 6-8 weeks of age by intramuscular route or wing web method. - Successful or effective vaccination can be judged by takes, where examination of vaccinated birds after 7-10 days of vaccination, show swelling or a scab at the site of puncture or vaccine application. - Absence of takes indicates poor potency of the vaccine, presence of maternal antibodies and improper vaccination. - In such cases, revaccination with new batch/ lot of vaccine should be done. - During disease outbreak, affected birds if less than 30% should be segregated immediately and the remaining birds must be vaccinated at earliest possible. - Standard sanitation and strict biosecurity measures can control the fowl pox. - Disinfection of premises with sodium hydroxide (1:500), cresol (1:400) and phenol (3%) proved beneficial of fowl pox.

Causes | || || | | | Birds consuming beetles | | Birds in poor environmental condition | | Contaminated eggs - Escherichia coli is a normal inhabitant of the digestive tract and wild birds, which are source of infection for poultry flocks and spread is by direct or indirect contacts. - Organisms are susceptible to common physical and chemical disinfectants. They can survive in freezing and can remain viable for long period at low temperatures. - In litter, high ammonia concentration can inactivate rapidly and survive at 370C for 1-2 days. - Trachea, caeca and oviduct of recovered birds can harbor E.coli for several weeks. - Organisms are not transmitted through eggs. - Beetles can transmit the bacteria and birds consuming these beetles get the infection. - Large numbers of E. coli are maintained in the poultry house environment through fecal contamination. - Initial exposure to pathogenic E. coli may occur in the hatchery from infected or contaminated eggs, but systemic infection usually requires predisposing environmental factors or infectious causes. - Mycoplasmosis, infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, hemorrhagic enteritis, and turkey bordetellosis precede colibacillosis. - Poor air quality and other environmental stresses may also predispose to E coli infections. - A hatching environment that is not sufficiently humid is often associated with a high incidence of yolk sac infection. E.coli multiplies rapidly in the intestines of newly hatched chicks and infection spreads rapidly from chick to chick in the hatchery and brooders. Clinical symptoms | || || | | | Depression and disinclination to move | | Mortality in a batch of chicks - first week after hatching | | Swollen Head Syndrome - Affected birds will have respiratory symptoms, depression, loss of appetite and disinclination to move. - Soiling of vent with pasty diarrhoeic faeces will be seen. - In Coliform omphalitis/yolk sac infection causes mortality in a batch of chicks in the first week of life after hatching.

Gross lesions - Subcutaneous tissues of feet shows petechial haemorrhages. - Haemorrhages in thigh and chest muscles. - Hyperemia of trachea. - Haemorrhages in internal organs. Prevention and control - Strict biosecurity measures can prevent the introduction of disease through infected birds into the farm. - Vaccines can prevent clinical signs and death. Furthermore, viral replication and shedding from the respiratory and GI tracts may be reduced in vaccinated birds. - Proper disposal of the infected birds and their secretions and excretions followed by proper disinfection of poultry houses and equipment with sodium hypochlorite (5.25%), sodium hydroxide (2%), sodium carbonate (4%) and phenolic compounds. - Complete destruction of eggs, feed ingredients, litter materials, affected birds in deep pit with addition of lime. - Restriction of movement of poultry equipment and people within the farm during outbreak. - The contact between wild birds and domestic birds should be avoided, as former are reservoirs of infection. - Burning, burying or composting can destroy viruses in litter and manure. - Inactivated influenza virus vaccines can be effective in reducing the mortality and production losses. However, immunity produced is subtype-specific and is not practical to use preventive vaccination for all subtypes. Vaccine can be useful where virus subtype is identified. - Suspected outbreaks should be reported to appropriate regulatory authorities. [TOP](Disease Control And Management.html) Ascariasis Nature of disease | || | | | Anaemia and weight loss | | Young birds up to 3 months of age are more susceptible - This is a worm infestation of chickens. - Young birds up to 3 months of age are more susceptible. - It has significant effect on the production of birds. - It causes diarrhoea, anaemia, weight loss, increased mortality and reduced egg production. Causes | || || | | | Ascaridia galli | | Malnourished bird | | Reusing of litter materials - Ascaridia galli is the species found in intestines of chickens. - Ascaridia are the largest roundworm of birds. - Parasites usually affect malnourished flocks. - Serious infection occurs if the litter is reused in the case of broilers. - Dietary deficiencies such as vitamin A, B and B12, various minerals and proteins leads to heavy infection. - A.galli eggs are ingested by grass hoppers or earth worms, hatch, and are infective to chickens. - Under optimum conditions of temperature and moisture, eggs in the droppings become infective in 10 - 12 days. - Eggs are quite resistant to low temperatures. - Chicken over 3 months are more resistant to infection. Clinical symptoms | || || | | | Occlusion of thread like worms in intestine | | Anaemic | | Decreased egg production - Cause poor bodily condition and weight loss. - Birds become anaemic and suffer from diarrhoea. - In heavy affection, it causes haemorrhagic enteritis. - Loss of blood and increased mortality. - Affected birds become unthrifty, markedly emaciated and egg production is decreased Gross lesions - Occlusion of thread like worms in the intestine. - In heavy infection, intestinal obstruction may occur. - Ascaridia wormsmay found in the hen's egg. Infected eggs can be detected by candling. Prevention and control | || || | | | Changing litter material | | Clean feeding troughs | | Clean feeding and water - Regular deworming of chicks with piperazine compounds is highly effective. - Young birds should be separated from older birds. - Avoid reuse of litter materials. - Changing of litter can reduce infections. - Treatment of the soil or litter to kill intermediate hosts is useful. - Litter may be treated with suitable insecticides. - Litter materials should always be kept in dry condition. - Extreme care should be taken to ensure that feed and water are not contaminated. - Provide clean feeding troughs and drinking water appliances. - Poultry runs should be well drained.
