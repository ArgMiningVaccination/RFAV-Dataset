CHINESE MEDICINE & HEALING SESSION David's treatments relieve physical, mental, and emotional stress and pain. Chinese medicine can address any symptoms of disharmony like weight gain, fatigue, depression, digestion problems, menstrual issues, poor sleep, headaches, high blood pressure and cholesterol, etc. It can also treat advanced conditions like arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, ovarian cysts, cancer, etc. It goes deep to the core to treat the root of disease by igniting and balancing the functions of the internal organs, and can often replace pharmaceuticals and harmful procedures. Acupuncture can release any negative patterns that hold you back or cause you pain, both physical and mental. Most people experience very little or no pain from the treatment, followed by a deeply relaxed state similar to sleep during the session. Afterwards many report a feeling of lightness, euphoria, improved mobility, reduction in pain, increased energy, yet calm and relaxed at the same time.
