It combines oils or lotion with an array of modalities meant change the way your soft body tissue feels. (Get the pain, tension and stiffness out of your muscles, tendons, ligaments and connective tissue!) The benefits of this type of bodywork are wide-ranging and include relief from aches and pains, decreased stress levels in the body, enhanced mental clarity, improved appearance and posture, and greater flexibility. There are dozens of massage therapy methods and we will personalize each of your sessions so you are getting the massage specific to your needs! Medical Massage is performed with the intent on improving a medical condition that has been diagnosed by a physician. Your physician may even write a prescription that is covered by insurance! Medical massage does include more assessments and evaluations than the relaxing massage you may be used to and may also include connective tissue therapy, joint mobilization, manual traction, range of motion movements, manual lymphatic drainage and massage cupping, if these are appropriate for your condition. The key to medical massage success is consistency. Thank you for devoting some time to your recovery! ALL OF OUR SESSIONS ARE INTEGRATIVE MEDICAL MASSAGE SESSIONS. We are diligent about providing a service that is individual to your health needs and goals. Additional Massage Services Shiatsu Massage with Jessica: 30 minutes = $95 60 minutes = $125 90 minutes = $155 120 minutes = $185 Hot Stone Therapy: 60 minutes = $95 90 minutes = $125 Soul Essentials: 60 minutes = $90 90 minutes = $120 Sole Ease Foot Massage: 40 minutes = $65 TMJ Release Massage: 30 minutes = $65 Craniosacral minutes = $95 90 minutes - $125 Shiatsu Massage with Jessica A traditional Chinese Medicine and Japanese variation of massage, done fully clothed, on a massage table. (Please wear clothes you would exercise or do yoga in.) This bodywork is based on pseudoscience concepts that use meridian lines in your body to deliver various effects to enhance your wellbeing. (As opposed to working only with the anatomy of your muscle and joint structures). Shiatsu translates to \"finger pressure\" and you will feel your massage therapist use their thumbs, palms, fingers and feet to provide compression, holding, stretching various points along the meridian channels that travel throughout your whole body. Different meridians are associated with different parts of your body and the conditions of well being or disease that they can hold.Shiatsu massage is known for creating a harmonious flow of \"qi\" or energy flow in a recipient and this could result in a sense of vitality, improved well-being, better sleep, and relaxation. While working with your other healthcare providers, shiatsu could be added to your wellness plan. This modality could be beneficial for inflammation disorders, limited mobility and flexibility, chronic body aches and pains, circulatory issues, digestive disorders, stress and mental health management and so much more. Note: Your first shiatsu session will require a phone call consultation so an individualized sequence is created for your specific needs. Hot Stone Therapy is a style of massage where heated stones are placed at specific sites on your body to deepen relaxation and promote circulation in your muscles. Muscles that are heated with these stones release tension and stress much more deeply and quickly than with a traditional massage. You are also massaged with heated stones and warm oil. The overall experience is very relaxing, nurturing, and rejuvenating. Soul Essentials is a very gentle massage that focuses on balancing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems of the body by applying essential oils along energy meridians and contact points of the back, feet and hands that relate to key organs and body systems. Escape the woes of stress with a sequence of essential oils, each selected for its individual aromatic properties, and for their powerful aromatic properties when combined.

Sole Ease Foot Massage For those of you who have wished you could have an entire session dedicated to your tootsies, here you go! This ultimate foot massage includes reflexology points, hot towels and essential oils. It is amazing to experience what just massaging your feet can do for your whole body! TMJD (Temporal Mandibular Jaw Disorder) Release: If you suffer from snapping and clicking of the jaw and/or difficulty opening the jaw caused by tension, clenching or grinding of the jaw and teeth, this session is designed to provide you with relief. It includes intraoral (inside your mouth) release of the medial pterygoids, small but mighty muscles which close the jaw. Briefly intense, it creates space in the jaw, allowing for less tension and pain. If you have dental insurance, you may be able to seek reimbursement for some or all of your expense for this session (ask us questions about this before booking, please). Craniosacral Therapy: This type of bodywork uses a touch of 5 grams of pressure or less to release restrictions in the craniosacral system and improve the function of the central nervous system. CST reduces perceived restrictions in movement of the dural sheath and the flow of cerebrospinal fluid as a means of restoring well-being. It relieves compression in the bones of the head, sacrum, and spinal column, normalizes the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, removing blockages and enhancing the body's ability to heal. Sessions are between 60 and 90 minutes in length and can help with migraines, chronic neck and back pain, fibromyalgia and TMJD, among other conditions. Add-On Services* *These services are available as add-ons to massage services, and are not available \u00e0 la carte. When booking your appointment and add-on services online, please choose a time when there is at least 15-30 minutes after. Not all add-ons take that long, but we want to ensure you the best, spacious experience. (For example - if you would like a 60 minute massage at 1pm, please book your add-on of choice at 2:15pm.) Reiki Energy Work Reiki energy work assists to bring the 7 Chakras or energy centers in the body back into alignment and balance. A 20 minute Reiki session can be added on to the end of any massage. The session will include an sage cleanse (optional depending on allergies and scent sensitivities) followed by energy work to help clear blocks, encourage movement and balance the Chakras to better serve you. When your Chakras are healthy and open, it allows you to physically, mentally and emotionally engage with others at your best and to better handle the ups and downs in life. Reiki: $30 Dry Skin Brushing Naturally stimulate the skin's detoxification process with gentle dry brush strokes in the direction of lymph flow. Beginning with the feet and working toward the direction of the heart, dry brushing enhances the skins ability to remove waste from the body while exfoliating accumulated dead skin cells. This increases the nourishing of the skin with oils and creams during massage. [Download our Guide for Dry Skin Brushing at Home Here!](https://souleasemassage.com/soul-ease-dry-skin-brushing-manual-for-at-home/) Dry Skin Brushing: $25 [Dry Skin Brushing and \"Scentsory\" Experience](https://souleasemassage.com/dry-skin-brushing-scentsory-experience/): $30 RockTape If you are a sports fan, you have probably seen colorful tape splayed across the shoulders, knees, and backs of professional and Olympic athletes. RockTape is a therapeutic tape applied to different body parts to provide support, reduce pain, lessen swelling, and improve overall performance. You will find different brands of tape on the market, RockTape being one of them. RockTape is meant to allow full movement of the taped area unlike conventional taping which is meant to prevent any movement at all. RockTape can be used to treat sports and non-sports injuries, including shin splints, plantar fasciitis, runner's knee and back pain. When applied correctly, RockTape's unique elasticity causes the skin to form convolutions and wrinkle, which decompresses the tissue. The decompression has three main effects: 1. Blood and lymphatic flow in the taped area are improved. 2. Improves the slide and glide between tissue layers. 3. Reduces pain perception ability. It works by altering the pain signals reaching the brain, turning down the volume of the pain you perceive. RockTape: $25 Soul Sleep How many times have you said, \"I could lay here and take a nap!\" after your massage? Delay getting back to reality and move at your own pace. Add an extra 10 minutes of dozing and relaxing time to the end of your massage. Want more than 10 minutes? Make your arrangements with Melanie. Soul Sleep: $15 Abdominal Castor Oil Pack This natural detoxification pack made from flannel fabric soaked in castor oil is placed over the liver and then warmed with a hot water bottle. This stimulates the liver to help balance digestion, improves lymph circulation, draw infections out of the body, and promotes overall balanced health. Rest well while enjoying the combination of warmth from the pack and soothing massage. Abdominal Castor Oil Pack: $30 Paraffin Wax Dip Mmm, warm paraffin wax melting on your hands and feet is so delicious! This form of heat therapy helps increase blood flow, relax muscles and improve mobility. It can be used medically to reduce spasm and inflammation in sprains. Those with arthritis, fibromyalgia and other joint mobility challenges can experience pain relief! The wax is a natural emollient and will help skin feel soft, supple and moisturized long after the treatment!
