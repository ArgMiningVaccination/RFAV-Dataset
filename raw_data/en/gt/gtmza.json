Here's how to make spotty glasses, filmy decanters, and waxy candleholders sparkle. Glasses: To remove hard water deposits, warm two cups of white vinegar in the microwave for two minutes and pour it into a plastic basin. Place glasses, on their sides, into the vinegar. Soak for three minutes. Rinse them in clear water and dry with a lint-free towel. I like E-Cloth's textured drinkware towel ($8, [ecloth.com](http://ecloth.corecommerce.com/Drinkware-Drying-Polishing-Towel.html)). I use it to dry my stemware and never see a spec of lint \u2014 in fact, it was originally developed for bartenders. If any stubborn spots remain, dampen your finger, dip it into baking soda and lightly polish the spot away. Rinse and dry. Decanters and Vases: To clean these narrow-neck vessels, fill halfway with very warm water. Squirt in a little dish liquid and add two tablespoons of ammonia. Then, pour in 1/2 cup uncooked white rice and swirl so the mixture scrubs the sides of the glass. Let it sit for a few minutes to dissolve any sediment, and swirl again. Drain the vase, and rinse with warm water. Place it upside down in a rack to allow the interior to drip and air dry.

Peel off whatever wax you can, and then use a delicate scrub sponge to remove any remaining bits from the cut crevices of the crystal. Wash in hot, sudsy water, and dry. Another strategy: Pop the candleholders in the freezer for several hours and the brittle wax should easily chip off.
