Our writers, editorial staff, and board have worked tirelessl y to share with you topics that we find fascinating. We hope that these slices of science make a meaningful impact on your life and give you a fresh perspec - tive on the world. Be it the illusion of invisibility or the details of a tracking system, we hope that each article allows you to pause and think, maybe even to say \"wow, that's reall y cool\" about your everyday life. Societies are founded on the laws of nature, and the better each of us understands its patterns, the better we, as citizens of the natural world, can understand our limitations as a species, or where we should place limitations. T oday, mankind has taken its technological advantages too far and put a tremendous strain on the earth. It is time to put limitations on oursel ves. As the recent American \"green\" movement has made us more aware of the implications of our actions on the environment, it is a good time to reconsider our relationship with nature. This issue is devoted to the purpose of reuniting you, the reader, with your natural envi - ronment, so that you can better understand the impact of science on your life. Shell y Zhu Presidentepeditor 's Letter President 's Letter In every issue of the Columbia Science Review, we aim to present engaging articles on developing ar - eas of research and demonstrate the relevance of science and technology in our dail y lives. This issue is no exception, as it covers many exciting topics in science, including the emerging field of neuroengi - neering and the technology behind invisibility. But how do they affect your life? I'm going to venture out on a limb and assume that very few of you are epileptic, have had a heart attack, suffer from trigeminal neuralgia, use alternative medicine, have an implanted tracking microchip, and dream of being invisible. So not ev - ery article will be directl y applicable to your life. But the scope of these articles is broad enough to engage everyone. Many of us are familiar with Harry Potter's invisibility cloak, en joy art, and/or know someone suffering from a mental disease or heart disease. From this issue, hopefull y you will learn a little more about these topics and gain a better understanding of the work and research behind them, as well as the social, political and ethical issues surrounding them. Some articles may answer questions you've had and raise even more. I hope these articles will spark your curiosity for science and all its implications. Ying Li editor-in-Chief F all 2009 7 Editorial V edant Misra In the fifth century BCE, the Greek philoso - pher Leucippus proposed that the world was made of tiny indestructible building blocks\u2014atoms\u2014that were too small to see but present in everything. He was right, but he couldn't have predicted the bizarre implica - tions of his theory. If the physical world is comprised entirel y of atoms, can a compre - hensive understanding of atoms provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the world? It is this tantalizing idea that moti - vates scientific reductionism. Scientists tend to study increasingl y smaller things. While V esalius studied entire organ systems in the 16th century, today we study the behavior of individual proteins. Earl y chemists knew noth - ing of microscopic properties of the substanc - es they combined, but today's chemists are intimatel y familiar with the molecular mecha - nisms of reactions. And for physicists\u2014espe - ciall y theoretical physicists\u2014reductionism is a dogma. Those who study particle physics seek to full y describe the elementary con - stituents of matter and radiation, with the ulti - mate goal of linking together all known physi - cal phenomena in a single unified framework. The theory that attempts to do this has been dubbed, with shameless hubris, \"the theory of everything.\" It isn't obvious why a theory of small things can form the basis of a theory of ev - erything, especiall y given that the realm of the tiny is so different from the realm of the large. The most fundamental properties of the macroscopic world\u2014for instance, the na - ture of cause and effect\u2014are different at the microscopic level. In our world, the nature of causality is self-evident. Actions beget ef - fects. Loosen your grip on an empty Snapple bottle as you dangle it over the recycling bin, and it crashes down. Flip a power switch and the tungsten filament in your desk lamp glows white-hot. Stay up all night before a final exam and your GP A takes a hit. We are so familiar with cause and effect that we tend to believe the world is a deterministic place in which every event is a direct consequence of those that precede it. But this isn't true of physics at small scales. The world of particles is a very differ - ent place, characterized by bizarre phenom - ena like the spontaneous production and an - nihilation of particles. The lives of quanta, or tiny packets of energy, are governed by probability and not by determinism. That is, we cannot know for certain the nature of any system of quanta, onl y the probability that it takes a given form. How, then, can a theory that seeks to describe all of nature be based on the be - havior of atoms and their constituents? The answer lies in the fact that the physical world is rife with what are called \"emergent\" phenomena\u2014behavior that arises out of a multiplicity of simple interactions. It is an emergent property of the physical world that very large systems of simple and tiny el - ements, like subatomic particles, exhibit com - plex behavior. So while it's tantalizing to think that one day a \"theory of everything\" might also be the best way to understand the uni - verse, this is a pipe dream. T o pursue it is to be guilty of what Daniel Dennett, in his book Darwin's Dangerous Idea , termed \"greedy re - ductionism.\" A theory of everything should in principle explain everything made out of the subatomic particles\u2014from molecules and skin cells to geese and galaxies. But to reduce any of these things all the way down to particle physics is \"greedy,\" because particle physics is not the best way to understand them. REDUCTIONISM & COMPLEXITY why we study small thingsColumbia Science Review 8 Cock tail Science According to Peter Savolainen of the Royal Institute of T echnol - ogy in Stockholm, Sweden, wol ves were most likel y domesticated for their meat. Savolainen's team ana - l yzed mitochondrial DNA samples from all over the world and found that dogs from southern China had the highest diversity. This suggests that domestication first occurred in southern China and spread from there because diversity is lost as a species spreads. He estimates that this domestication event occurred about 11,000 to 14,000 years ago. Evidence of dog bones found with cut marks at archaeological sites suggests that people living in southern China have a long his - tory of eating dogs. He believes the wol ves first became domesticated when scavenging around human garbage. Once the wol ves became tamer, humans probabl y captured them for food. These findings are extremel y important since the do - mestication of animals is an impor - tant event that enabled humans to form their communities.C o c k t a i l S c i e n c eLaika Simeon Ying Li SheLLY Zhu LiSa Weber F all 2009 9 Cock tail Science Biologists at the University of Arizona have discovered a rare species of Amazonian ant that re - produces without sex. The Myco - cepurus smithii are an all female group and they reproduce by clon - ing instead of sexual reproduction. Dissection of the ants revealed that they are physicall y incapable of mating, as an essential part of their sexual organs have degenerated. Asexual reproduction of females is extremel y rare in ants and this is the first species that has been shown to reproduce entirel y without sex. Many breeds of ants cultivate fungi for food and this species of ant actuall y farm a kind of fungi that also reproduces asexuall y. They are known for their success at farming fungi as they are able to grow a greater number of crops than other ant species. This success may be because of the all-female nature of the species. The energetic costs of producing males are avoided be - cause all the members of the colo - ny are simpl y clones of the queen. However, asexual reproduction also makes the colony very vulnerable to pandemics as a single virus could wipe them out since they all have the same immune systems.For thousands of years, women have been using cosmetics, al - though many, unsafel y. Ancient Egyptian and Roman women were known for using a lead-based foun - dation, causing damage to their nervous systems. The skin, which is a porous organ, is exposed to over 126 chemicals everyday via products such as shampoo, soap, makeup, and detergent. Innovations in chemistry have made cosmetics increasingl y complex. Some chemi - cals used in one state may be dan - gerous in other states. For example, titanium dioxide is considered safe when used as a cream base, but it can cause cancer when in powder form. Although the EU has banned the use of more than 1,000 chemi - cals in the production of cosmet - ics, the FDA has barred onl y 8 substances. \"The [cosmetic] firm's responsibility to assure that its cos - metic products and ingredients are safe and properl y labeled,\" explains the FDA website. However, we must still be careful incase cosmetic companies are not doing their jobs. Did you know that New Y ork City was once covered by gla - ciers over 1,000 feet thick? Span - ning as far south as New Y ork City, the Wisconsin Ice Sheet represents one of the last glacial advances that began forming during the Pleistocene Era. It began retreating 18,000 years ago, but not without leaving its mark. Just take a look around the city's parks and you can see how large a role the glaciers played in shaping the topography that exists today. Strolling through Central Park, you can see the gla - cial grooves on the rock outcrops that serve as a steady reminder of the glaciers' force. In addition, glacial erratics that were carried by glaciers from the Palisades and deposited in Central Park amongst the Manhattan schist give attention to the glaciers' strength. Even the Hudson River, the southernmost glacial f jord in the Northern Hemi - sphere, serves as a remnant of the last ice age. There is a little piece of geological history in nearl y every corner of this city - you just need to know where to look! Columbia Science Review 10 10 Alternative Medicine Not worried about your health? Perhaps you should be. Newspapers and television constantly present stories about how our lifestyles are making us sick: obsessive fretting over tomorrow's meeting causes anxiety and panic attacks, and drinking tea steeped too hot increases our risk for cancers eightfold. Even staying inside the house is hazardous: we risk poisoning from chemicals in plastic water bottles and skin cancer from exposure to microwave radiation. Research labs continuously grind out study after study, leaving us increasingly self-conscious about our health. It is no wonder that 51% of insured Americans are on prescription medication for at least one chronic illness and 40% of these pill-poppers are swallowing three or more different capsules a day. Patients are also frequently overprescribed pills, exacerbating our society's dependence on pharmaceutical drugs. This could be an indication of our nation's health awareness \u2014a sign that health problems are being addressed. On the other hand, many believe that we have entered an era of hypochondriac overdependence on a pill-shaped solution. Wary of the for-profit pharmaceutical industry but concerned about their health, many Americans turn to alternative medicine. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to treatment and therapy outside of conventional, Western, and MD-approved pharmaceutical-based medicine. Complementary medicine is used in con junction with conventional medicine, such as using aromatherapy or music therapy to increase relaxation following surgery, while alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. A person who relies on alternative medicine might go to a chiropractor instead of a doctor as his primary care provider. He or she might also resort to meditation as a treatment for ADHD, instead of taking the usual prescription drugs, i.e. Adderall or Ritalin. The types of practices and products considered CAM are also open to interpretation, varying from Chinese herbology to strictly organic diets and music therapy. Prayer was the most popular CAM choice as of 2002, according to a Center for Disease Control (CDC) and National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) study. The next five most commonly used therapies, in order of popularity, are herbalism, breathing meditation, mental meditation, chiropractic medicine, and yoga. Both US and UK-based surveys have found that alternative medicine is gaining widespread popularity, and its popularity has doubled over the last six years. As of 2002, 49.8% of Americans had used complementary or alternative medicine before, and 36.0% of them had done so in the past year. These figures do not include the use of prayer as a form of medical treatment; when prayer is considered, the number of CAM users in America increases to three out of every four people. Weiyi Muexploring alternative medicineF all 2009 11 Alternative Medicine This leads us to the all-important question: does alternative medicine actually work, or is it just a placebo effect? Along with chiropractic care, the rest of CAM has been notoriously dismissed by the medical community as \"quackery\" in the past. Scientists and pharmacists who have studied the molecular function of drugs are understandably skeptical about directing invisible chi into an enervated patient. The scientific community has even warned against the dangers of alternative medicine, citing specious therapies like chelation therapy, in which a patient ingests metal-binding molecules like EDT A (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) to treat disorders not related to metal poisoning, like coronary artery disease. They call for rigorous scientific studies that clearly show CAM's effectiveness, and for patients to abandon all therapies that do not meet these standards. In response to these demands for rigorous research, the aforementioned National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) was established in 1999 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to sponsor and conduct unbiased research on the efficacies of various CAMs. For example, researchers under NCCAM grants have shown ginsenoside Rg5, the active ingredient in traditional Chinese herb ginseng, to be effective in slowing dermatitis, as an antidepressant, and as an inhibitor of angiogenesis of lung cancer. All new findings appear regularly on the NCCAM website for public access. As these recent studies suggest, there is reason to look closer at certain CAMs before we label the entirety of alternative medicine as feckless. Careful testing of artemisinin, a traditional Chinese herbal remedy, has revealed it to be a faster killer of the malaria parasite than any other drug. We must also remember that CAM is only an umbrella category for an incredible variety of treatments, some of which we should consider with caution. Dr. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch.org recommends classifying alternative medicine into three categories: genuine, experimental, and questionable, based on the results of several rigorous control-based studies. While studies on \"questionable\" alternative treatments such as homeopathy have produced insufficient evidence for effectiveness, the benefits of other therapies like acupuncture and reflexology are being published, registered, and accepted by doctors all over the UK and US. Health professionals today are keener to incorporate alternative methods they deem viable into their traditional practice, in a compromise known as integrative medicine. Currently, twelve top American medical schools\u2014Harvard and Columbia among them\u2014 have incorporated CAM programs into the curriculum. CAMs continue to challenge our pill-popping approach to medicine, and as a hypochondriac nation, we should be thankful to have more viable therapies from which to choose.

During a myocardial infarction (MI), a blockage in the coronary arteries, that provide oxygen-rich blood to the cardiac muscle, causes the muscle to die from oxygen deprivation. As a result, the victim feels the classic heart attack symptoms of crushing chest pain, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Though immediate treatment with nitrogl ycerin and anti-clotting agents may save a patient from death, the effects from a MI can be devastating. Cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are usu - all y unable to regenerate and scar tissue replaces the lost cells at the damage site. This increases the chance of ventricular fibrilla - tion, when the heart fails to pump synchronousl y ; tachycardia , an abnormall y rapid heart rate; and ventricular aneurysms, in which the weakened scar tissue from the infarction stretches and bulges. Aneurysms can have detrimental long-term effects such as heart failure, as the bulge prevents the heart from pumping effectivel y. ExpErimEnts on stEm CELL thErapy for post-mi While conventional therapy aims to slow the progression of heart failure, it is unable to repair the existing problem. One so - lution is to regenerate cardiomyocytes and create new blood ves - sels to feed them, a process called angiogenesis. Emerging stem cell therapy offers researchers the opportunity to discover the potential for cardiac repair, which will prove useful in con junction with conventional and preventative treatments. In a 2003 experi - ment invol ving the treatment of damaged rat hearts with stem cells, is has been shown that \"stem cell delivery generated new cardiomyocytes of embryonic stem cell origin that integrated with host myocardium within infarct regions\". During the 1990's, the idea that damaged hearts can be repaired by introducing stem cells directl y into the diseased myocardium became a topic of much study. Success of this procedure would rel y on the ability of cardiac cells to regenerate and engraft onto the muscle of the recipient heart, improving cardiac output. Since scientists reported the first successful cardiac stem cell engraftment using skeletal myoblast cells in 1993, experiments have been repeated, display - ing the success of this procedure. In one experiment performed at the Mayo Clinic, em - bryonic stem cell (ESC) treatment yielded positive results in in - farcted mice hearts. Compared to the placebo group, the mice treated with stem cells exhibited fewer aneurysms and decreased ventricular dysfunctions, scarring, and ventricular cavity dilation. There was no evidence of tumors and graft re jection, the two ma jor safety concerns of stem-cell therapy, and the hearts exhib - ited cardiomyocyte regeneration and integration into the cardiac tissue. The mice exhibited these benefits of heart cell regenera - tion for over twel ve months after the introduction of the cells, illustrating the possible long-term benefits of stem cell therapy. Another experiment on mice using different stem cell lines for the heart treatment yielded modest benefits in cardiac function, cardiomyocyte regeneration, and provided evidence \"that infarcted myocardium does not tumor growth\" despite the pres - ence of teratomas, or germ cell tumors, in 21% of the infarcted hearts. These tumors were onl y found in the ischemic myocardium On March 9, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the executive order removing the barriers against stem cell research. Now, the door to exciting discoveries and promising stem-cell cures has been opened. But in what direction is current research heading? Many scien - tists are exploring ways in which stem cells can regenerate damaged tissue, the most important being cardiac tissue. The heart is a tireless organ that beats around 72 times per minute, translat - ing to roughl y 2.5 billion beats by the time you are 70 years old. If part of the heart muscle does not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients, the heart will fail to deliver the precious blood the body needs - a heart attack.Amy Huang 12 F all 2009 13 Healing the Hear t and not on normal tissue. Though experiments using animal models showed marked improvement in cardiac function after ESC therapy, human clinical trials indicated varying degrees of success. In an experiment invol v - ing eight patients with severe ischemic heart disease, ESC therapy reduced symptoms and improved heart function, especiall y with evidence of revascularization, or the formation of new blood ves - sels, without ma jor complications. ChoiCE and trEatmEnt of stEm CELLs One must first determine the best source of stem cells, and then the best method for introducing them into the recipient. Historicall y, scientists have used skeletal myoblasts, stem cells isolated from muscle, but researchers are currentl y experimenting with different cell lines, one of which is the bone marrow-derived c-kit+ cells. There are currentl y four categories of stem cells be - ing studied for cardiac repair after an ischemic episode in animal models: bone marrow-derived/circulating resi - dent cardiac stem cells (CMPCs). BMPCs and SMs are ineffective grafts, but the newl y-discovered CMPCs and the ESCs have high potential in improving heart function. Earl y experiments with SMs answer two problems with using the cell line as a graft: whether they can transform into cardiomyocytes and whether the recipient will engraft, or take up the graft cells. In a 2003 experiment with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and SM-derived cells in jected into rats, scientists determined that SMs can indeed transform and engraft within wounded myocardium within 4 weeks. However, the SMs did not successfull y engraft in normal myocardial tissue, which indicated that the benefits were \"due to secondary effects of the cells\", ef - fects that are not produced directl y by the engrafted cells. When not engrafted, the SMs did not display significant electrical cou - pling with the normal heart cells and thus did not participate in cardiac functioning. Surprisingl y, SM experiments revealed a more favorable response in the phase I human clinical trials following the 2003 experiment. These studies indicate the safety and ef - fectiveness of SM grafts in improving cardiac function of patients with certain heart problems. ESCs can be incorporated in both normal and in jured myocardium and are shown to be more effective than SMs used in earlier experiments. However, the problem remains that the posi - tive effects of the stem cells are merel y a result of these cells' indirect activity, as the size of the graft is too small to provide any significant contractile activity. Perhaps the \"indirect activity\" comes from the action of stimulating factors and cytokines, or cell-signaling factors released by the engrafted stem cells to en - courage angiogenesis. In an experiment with 409 patients invol v - ing the in jection of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) into infarcted hearts, a marked improvement of the treated pa - tients. However, treatment resulted in high rates of restenosis, the recurrent narrowing of blood vessels, indicating possible safety concerns for stem cell treatment. thE futurE of post-mi stEm CELL thErapy There are some problems concerning stem cell therapy to treat post-myocardial infarction problems. Bone marrow aspiration to obtain embryonic stem cells is invasive, but bone marrow is the richest source of these cells. Another critical issue is whether mouse models can be applied to human clinical trials. Currentl y, it is assumed that heart failure and MI symptoms are caused by decreased numbers of cardiomyocytes and that stem cell thera - py is effective because it assists the heart in recovering a sizable amount of these cells. Even if differentiation does not improve heart function significantl y, it would be practical to know which specific cytokines are responsible for angiogenesis and repair of the ischemic myocardium for future experiments. The mechanisms for tissue regeneration and angiogenesis in the myocardium remain unclear, as do the factors responsible for car - diac repair. While some studies suggest that stem cell treatment is safe and effective, others point out inherent risks and the lack of cardiac improvement after therapy in some cases. Researchers are currentl y performing human clinical trials due to the success - ful response from experimental animal models. Healing the heart with stem cells might not be standard treatment in the near fu - ture, but it is the next frontier that will revolutionize future treat - ments for post-MI dysfunctions.

Eating, appl ying makeup, or even encountering a gust of wind can trig - ger hour-long episodes of searing pain that may leave them unable to eat or sleep. Spending months or years with intermittent bouts of this ex - quisite pain, they are diagnosed with jaw joint disorders or undergo root canal operations and tooth extrac - tions. Y et their problem is actuall y not muscular or dental in origin at all; the real culprit is a neuropathic disorder known as trigeminal neuralgia (TN). T rigeminal neuralgia (also known as tic douloureux) is characterized by what many believe to be the most painful sensation to afflict human - ity. Most commonl y, a sharp, electric- shock-like sensation is felt in one jaw or cheek for a period of several sec - onds, before giving way to an agonizing ache felt deep in the face. Episodes of severe pain come and go throughout the course of a day, sometimes in re - sponse to particular stimuli and other times spontaneousl y. Over the course of several weeks, these episodes usu - all y become more frequent and the pain more incapacitating. Although the condition may disappear for weeks or months at a time, most people see it recur if it is not treated. The disorder is more common in women than men, and rare in those younger than 50. T rigeminal neuralgia stems from an abnormal condition of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which is re - sponsible for transmitting facial touch, pain, and temperature information to the brain. Although the disorder has been linked to tumors that appear near the nerve and later stages of mul - tiple sclerosis, it is most often caused by vascular compression of the nerve as it exits the brainstem. A blood ves - sel, usuall y the superior cerebellar ar - tery, indents the trigeminal nerve and causes focal demyelination.

Suddenl y, a sharp, stabbing pain invades your jaw, causing you to writhe in agony. Y ou go to the dentist, wondering whether the combina - tion of late night snacks and careless brushing of your teeth has finall y led to a particularl y nasty root canal. Masood ManoochehriF all 2009 15 Perspectives positioned axons tend to generate spontaneous nerve im - pulses that are further conducted to ad jacent sensory fi - bers. This resulting hyperactivity is thought to be respon - sible for the sharp pain in response to generall y light stimuli. Most patients with TN are eventuall y diagnosed onl y after months or years of being misdiagnosed and un - dergoing many tests and procedures. Sometimes, a stan - dard magnetic resonance imaging scan shows a blood vessel on the trigeminal nerve. Frequentl y, magnetic resonance angiography, in which a colored dye is in jected into the bloodstream prior to the scan, captures blood vessel abnormalities and offers more direct evidence of compression of the nerve close to the brainstem. When the correct diagnosis is finall y made, medication is prescribed, with the most common and effective options being anticonvulsant drugs like carbamazepine or phenytoin. These agents generall y decrease the electrical activity of the trigeminal nerve by stabilizing the inactive state of the voltage-gated sodium channels necessary for conducting action potentials. If these are ineffective, a different class of anti-convulsants including gabapentin and pregabalin may additionall y be prescribed. While half of patients are able to manage their pain by some combination of these drugs, for the rest, lingering and recurrent episodes of severe pain remain. For these patients, the next option is often a class of procedures aimed at damaging the trigeminal nerve at the nerve root, close to the brainstem. Called rhizotomies, these procedures can use a wide variety of techniques, in - cluding chemical (gl ycerol in jection), mechanical (balloon mi - crocompression), and radioactive (gamma knife radiosurgery) means to cause in jury to the nerve. The resulting changes in nerve function can be effective in alleviating the TN pain. Y et some type of sensory loss and facial numbness com - monl y accompanies the partial success of these measures. The best long-term solution for individuals un - responsive to medication is microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery. Under general anesthesia, a surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and tries to visualize the trigemi - nal nerve with an operative microscope. The blood vessels compressing the nerve are gentl y moved. A soft cushion of inert, shredded T eflon\u00ae felt is placed between the nerve and the vessels, acting as a permanent implant that sus - tains the decompression. Upon waking, patients are pain- free, and are graduall y weaned off the previousl y prescribed \"a hot cup of coffee , a slight touch of the f ace, or even stress can trigger hour -long episodes of searing p ain\" medications. This technique is the most invasive treatment for TN, posing risks including hearing loss and stroke. How - ever, it offers the best chance for a full recovery, as 80% of patients experience no recurrence of pain within 10 years. A century ago, the incomparable pain of trigeminal neu - ralgia drove so many to suicide that the disorder itself was referred to as the \"suicide disease.\" The array of op - tions available today to treat this once completel y incapacitating affliction is evidence of impressive ef - forts to relieve one of the most agonizing pains known.

Well, science is providing the ability to do just that. Newl y engineered, structurall y altered materials, called metamaterials, are revolutionizing our capability to manipulate matter. Jennifer HouPerspectivesF all 2009 17 RevealedPerspectivesColumbia Science Review 18 Invisiblity The idea behind making something invisible or creating an invisibility cloak like that in Harry Potter, is to al ter the interaction between ob jects and light. We are able to see an ob ject when light bounces off it and forms an image on our retinas. Thus, if light could be forced to move around an ob ject without being reflected back to us, we would not know that the ob ject was there. The laws of light refraction that had been accepted for so many centuries are being challenged because metamaterials have proven that light can be made to bend in whatever direction desired, even in directions opposite to the way natural materials reflect light. These metamaterials are able to curve light around an ob ject, rendering it invisible. It all started in the 1990s when John Pendry, a physicist at Imperial College London, tried to determine how a radiation- absorbing carbon material could hide battleships from radar detection. Pendry found that it was not the electrical properties of the carbon element but rather the electrical properties arising from the shape of its long, thin fibers that allowed the radiation to be absorbed. The development of metamaterials grew out of the realization that a material's internal microstructure, its fine structure usuall y onl y visible through a microscope, is important in determining its optical characteristics. By manipulating the microstructure of materials, replacing atoms and molecules with engineered sub-wavelength units, new materials with properties not found in nature can be produced. The earliest types of metamaterials redirected waves in the invisible parts of the spectrum where the wavelength is longer, because this allowed the diameter of the engineered units to be larger. The goal was to extend this to other, smaller frequencies as the technology advanced. Last January, David R. Smith, Associate Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Duke University buil t a device that can hide an ob ject from microwave radiation by reflecting the microwaves away from the ob ject. Al though the device doesn't respond to light, it does show that it is possible to conceal all the different colors of an ob ject at once. According to Professor Smith, \"With appropriatel y fine-tuned metamaterials, electromagnetic radiation at frequencies ranging from visible light to radio could be redirected at will for virtuall y any application.\" Xiang Zhang, a professor at UC Berkeley's Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, also recognized the vast potential of these new materials and runs a leading metamaterials f abrication lab at UC Berkel y. In the summer of 2008, Zhang's lab created the first device that acts as an invisibility cloak and works in three dimensions. The structure of the cloak material has 21 al ternating sheets of sil ver and a glasslike substance, organized in a pattern that resembles a fishnet. Incoming light is bent by the structure's al ternating sheets. Thomas Zentgraf, a member of Zhang's lab, states that the new possibilities opened up by these metamaterials are as if \"you were raised in a world in which the onl y color was red. Then one day someone discovers blue.\" While these structures are very promising for a future invisibility cloak that could not onl y cloak persons but also ob jects like military tanks, there are limitations. For example, it would not be possible for the person inside the invisibility cloak to see out. According to Pendry, \"If I can't see you, you can't see me. It would be like being inside a sil very bubble.\" Thus, more research must be done before we have a full y functional cloak. Metamaterials have the potential for applications in concealing sound and any other type of waves in addition to electromagnetic waves. For radio frequencies, metamaterials could improve wireless communications by cloaking obstructions. Acoustic cloaks could act as \"protective shields, preventing the penetration of vibrations, sound or seismic waves,\" and yet other cloaks could shield shorelines from waves. In addition to hiding ob jects, metamaterials could also help us see ob jects better than ever before. By focusing light better, they may one day provide stronger lenses for supermicroscopes, allowing one to see individual strands of DNA within cells and many other microscopic structures. The possibilities are endless. Anything that is based on the interaction of waves and matter can be enhanced. Need a quiet place to study? Well, in the future, a cloak for sound waves may be just the thing for you.

In reality, Bour - baki is responsible for more than 40 volumes of such astounding quality, depth, and variety that it seems impossible that one man could have produced them all. In - deed, Nicholas Bourbaki is a pseudonym employed by a group of prominent French mathematicians since the earl y 1930s. The list of members is surprisingl y short, yet it in - cludes prominent names such as H. Cartan, C. Chevalley, A. Weil, R. Godement, S. Eilenberg, J. P. Serre, A. Borel, P. Cart - ier, S. Lang, J. T ate, and last but not least A. Grothendeick. Our story starts much earlier\u2014during World War I. France's policies did not award extra protection to uni - versity students, and many were sent to the front. Re - cords of the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in Paris confirm that two thirds of their undergraduate population did not make it back. In the 1920s, this re - sulted in an acute vacuum of young scientists and math - ematicians. As a result, many of the older lecturers ei - ther did not follow closel y, or were reluctant to teach modern developments in mathematics to their students. The Bourbaki group traces its roots to a small group of students at ENS who kept close ties after graduation. In the beginning of the 1930s, most members were em - ployed by universities around the country at entry level academic positions. Most of them were responsible for teaching introductory calculus courses from E. Goursat's T rait\u00e9 d'Anal yse , quite similar to Stewart's Calculus nowa - days. T o the Bourbaki group, the text embodied outdated views on the organization of fundamental mathematics\u2014a reflection of their own expe - rience. After much frustration, in 1934, they set up an informal group to produce a replacement. The original plan was to write a very general text, one that would be equall y ap - plicable in pure mathematics and in engineering con - texts. Several of the adopted approaches, however, severel y distanced the goal from its generic audience. Firstl y, covering a large amount of material in order to accommodate for everyone excluded all lay readers. Secondl y, the Bourbaki members were not onl y interested in teaching mathematics properl y, but also in its foundations. The turn of the century saw much research in set theory and logic, and by the 1930s, it was universall y acknowledged that all mathematical the - ory could be constructed via these simple tools. Neverthe - less, at the time there were no accounts which followed the trail and simultaneousl y reorganized the material in a consis - tent manner. This became an important part of the Bourbaki philosophy. Finall y, in order to follow their ambitious agenda, all results had to be proved either from first principles or on the basis of previous ones, much like a pyramid. Little did the Bourbaki men know, their first chapter, covering set theory, would be ready for publication four years later. Many of the members of the Bourbaki group changed over the years, yet the original goal was pursued activel y un - til the 1970s. This attempt to write an introductory calculus text resulted in a sequence of over 40 perfectl y executed volumes whose technical level far surpasses any introduc - tory text. It is inconceivable what contemporary math - ematics would have looked like without Nicholas Bourbaki.nicolas bourbakiremembering Atanas Atanasov F all 2009 19 Nicolas BourbakiColumbia 20 RFID RFID20 RFIDF all 2009 21 RFID RFIDW hat if, instead of scanning your Columbia ID card before entering Lerner Hall, a microchip in your arm, which contained all of your personal information, was scanned automaticall y? As you approach the building, the information on a subcutaneousl y implanted chip, referred to as a radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag, would be read by an RFID reader. Then, the RFID reader, also known as an interrogator, would decode the information and determine whether you were granted access to Lerner Hall. If you were granted access, the interrogator would send out another signal to the doors, which would automaticall y unlock as you approached the building. While this possibility may seem farfetched, it is quickl y becoming a reality. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of RFID technology in humans. By 2006, approximatel y 70 individuals in the US were implanted with RFID tags, including employees at the Ohio security company, Citywatcher.com, whose access to the company's facilities was controlled by their RFID tags. As of Jul y 2008, over 2000 individuals worldwide had been implanted with RFID tags, including many who were implanted for medical reasons. The increasing use of RFID tags in humans raises ethical concerns about the role of technology in society. Radiofrequency identification technology has been in use since the 1970s, but onl y recentl y has the technology gotten small and inexpensive enough for widespread use. These tags are mainl y used for tracking livestock and merchandise, and the idea of implanting these tags in humans has raised much public opposition. The leading manufacturer of RFID tags, VeriChip Corp, first introduced them for human use as an identification tool for people with medical concerns. For example, if an individual has Alzheimer's disease and cannot remember their personal information, a medical professional would be able to identify the individual and access their medical history in order to treat the patient properl y. Also, in the case of an emergency, the individual could be identified and their famil y members could be contacted because their personal information would be included in the tag. In fact, in Jul y 2008, 111 Alzheimer's patients in a retirement home in West Palm Beach, Florida, were implanted with RFID chips. In addition to this usage, advocates of human RFID tagging stress the importance of this technology as a way to identify individuals, healthy or ill, quickl y and accuratel y in the case of an emergency. For example, if an individual was found unconscious or unable to speak, doctors and rescue crews could scan the individual's arm to correctl y identify him or her. In 2006, Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, New Jersey, was the first hospital to install RFID readers in their emergency room. As of February 2006, 68 other hospitals had planned to use RFID technology in their emergency rooms. In addition, in a Report of the Council of Ethical and Judicial Affairs, the American Medical Association identifies a preliminary code of ethics concerning RFID tagging. In the report, the AMA presents the benefits of RFID tagging, saying \"these devices can improve the continuity and coordination of care with resulting reduction in adverse drug effects and medical errors.\" Despite these medical benefits, the potential for this technology to be used for other purposes is overwhelming. First, when individuals are implanted with RFID tags, they allow access to their personal information to anyone who has a reader that corresponds to their tag. Because the tag and reader communicate wirelessl y over a fixed distance, individuals have no way of knowing when their tag is being read or who is reading it. The possibility that these tags could become tracking devices is a primary concern about this technology. These tags allow access to personal information all the time, not onl y in the case of emergency, because there is no way to \"turn off\" the tag. Also, the possibility that these tags could be used as tracking devices outside of the medical sphere provides additional cause for concern. For example, in 2006, two employees for the company Citywatcher.com, were implanted with RFID tags as a way to control access into the company's facilities. In an article published in the Chicago T ribune in 2006, Sean Darks, the vice president of Citywatcher.com (who is also implanted with an RFID tag) explained, \"We wanted a way to say, 'Hey, we are a little different in the way that we take our security.\" However, the use of this technology raised concerns about privacy and individual rights. Although the RFID tags may reduce the hassle of ID badges for the employees, they also introduce the possibility that the company could track their activity while they are in the range of the company's reader. In the 2006 article, Darks claims that, \"Nobody's watching me and I'm not watching my employees with it.\" However, if more individuals are implanted, Sara Stream F all 2009 21 RFIDColumbia Science Review 22 RFID possibl y involuntaril y, there is no guarantee that these tags will not be used for tracking purposes. In response to this issue, California Governor Schwarzenegger passed a bill in 2007, which prohibits employers and others from requiring people to be implanted with RFID tags. Currentl y, California, Wisconsin, and North Dakota have passed legislation banning mandatory RFID implantation. In the Chicago T ribune article, Lee T ien, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, \"This may be appropriate for cattle, pets or packages, but for humans it is a very different issue.\" In the AMA's Jul y 2007 report, they recognize that these tags may be used for other purposes, such as tracking and surveillance. In addition to infringing on privacy rights, RFID tags may also serve as targets for identity theft. Although the FDA requires that each RFID tag is given a unique identification code which corresponds to a specific reader, it is possible for individuals to hack into these tags and to steal an individual's personal information. The AMA suggests the use of computer encryption and digital signatures to provide further security of the information that is stored in these tags. The potential for infringement of privacy rights and the susceptibility of these tags to security threats explain the fear that many people have of human implantation of RFID tags. The widespread implementation of human RFID tagging poses a frightening possibility for the future, in which individuals would be identified by scanning their arms, like produce is scanned at the grocery store check- out counter. The extent to which human RFID tagging could change the basis of human interactions, within and outside the medical context, is a cause for concern. In their 2007 report, the AMA stresses the importance of further research and investigation in order to properl y assess the benefits and risks of this technology. While human RFID implantation is intended to provide medical benefits, the use of this technology for other purposes may greatl y infringe upon individual rights, obscuring these potential benefits.

We are left to wonder how our hero will \"singlehandedl y\" continue the struggle against the evil Empire. But even a long time ago, that galaxy far, far away was in fact also light years ahead of us in dealing with the loss of extremi - ties. By the film's end, he has a new robotic hand that seamlessl y integrates tactile sensation with voluntary motor control; he can wield his lightsaber once more. From Star Wars to the Six Million Dollar Man, countless movies and televison shows have depicted the dissolution of the border between man and ma - chine. As a result, the individuals undergoing these bionic transfor -mations become (in the words of Daft Punk) harder, better, faster, and stronger. Recentl y, however, the gap between science fact and Holl ywood fiction has shrunk, thanks to advances being made in the new field of neuroengineering. Unlike the neuroscientist, who wishes to understand the physi - ological and biological underpin - nings of the nervous system, the neuroengineer takes a different approach: he or she wishes to take apart this system, but put it back together as more efficient and ultimatel y better than it was. Rather than studying the brain and figuring out indirect ways to affect its activity, neuroengineers del ve into the nitty-gritty of neu - ronal connections and patterns. A hot topic in neuroengineer - ing is known as the brain-comput -er interface (BCI), invol ving the communication and transfer of in - formation between the brain and an external device. This transfer comes in three varieties: invasive, partiall y invasive, and non-invasive methods. Invasive BCI techniques require the implantation of elec - trodes directl y into the gray mat - ter of the brain. Partiall y invasive BCIs also require surgery to open the skull; however, the electrical devices remain outside the brain, rather than invading the cerebral cortex. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is an example of a partial - l y invasive technique, where a pad of electrodes rests on top of the brain in order to measure its elec - trical activity. Interestingl y, while non-invasive procedures are gen - erall y the easiest and presumabl y neuro engineering Richard Barzagaetz sy pColumbia Science Review 24 \"neuroengineering is providing tremendous insights into localizing epileptic networks, treating mental illness, and brain imaging\"Neur oengineering safest means of creating a brain-computer interface, some information is lost both ways because signals are weakened due to interference from the skull. Nonetheless, it is from research done with BCIs that therapies for damaged or in - sufficient brain areas will come. Neuroprosthetics is a term often used interchangeabl y with brain-computer interfaces, as both introduce non-organ - ic components into neural pathways. But instead of purel y computational machinery, neuroprosthetics aim to be func - tional surrogates for what are commonl y mechanical sys - tems. They can be replacements for limbs lost in war or computer implants restoring sight or hearing to the previ - ousl y impaired. And not surprisingl y, the work done with neuroprosthetics is striking. In 1978, researcher William H. Dobelle implanted the first prototype of a device designed to restore vision to a Brookl yn man named Jerry. An implant of 68 electrodes directl y into Jerry's visual cortex allowed him to experience a primitive form of seeing called a \"phosphene,\" the sen - sation of seeing light. By 2002, a blind man named Jens Naumann became Dr. Dobelle's first paying patient for his second-generation implant; this time the phosphenes trans - lated into coherent vision. In 2005, researchers from Har - vard and Brown demonstrated control of a prosthetic hand by a quadraplegic man using onl y his \"thoughts\" (i.e. signals produced by intercortical neuronal activity). This and other work demonstrates the increasing possibility that one day, an amputee could be picking out a replacement leg from the shelf in the morning, and be home on the treadmill after dinner. The emphasis on patient care is no coincidence; indeed across the country, like at the University of Pennsyl vania, translational neuroengineering is quickl y becoming a focus of neurological and neurosurgical medical departments. Here, the focus is on transferring experimental work from the lab to the clinic. Neuroengineering is providing tremendous in - sights into localizing epileptic networks, treating mental ill - ness, and brain imaging. Even with the remarkable progress that has been made in the treatment of in jury and disease, neuroengineers have not forsaken their original goal of learning how to manipu - late and improve the basic circuitry of the brain. Ed Boy - den's Neuroengineering and Neuromedia Lab at MIT, along with Dr. Karl Deisseroth of Stanford, have made headway in this regard. T ogether, the two have developed a method of controlling small groups of neurons with what they have termed an \"optical switch.\" Like an on-off button, the switch uses pulses of light to cause the cells to either fire or cease activity. These switches are light sensitive genes inserted directl y into the desired portions of a mouse's brain. A fiber optic cable fed through the skull completes the switch, and allows precise amounts of light stimulation to be pumped in. With complete control over the altered neurons, Deis - seroth's group managed to force a mouse into an endless nmklzxcvbduF all 2009 25 nmklzx pattern of left turns. \"Y ou've got to wonder what he's thinking,\" Deisseroth muses. \"It's 'I gotta go left, I gotta go left.'\" If mice can be induced to turn left indefinitel y, we oursel ves have to wonder, \"What could they make me do?\" Indeed, neuroengineering has be - gun to examine its practical applications, including improving the quality of life for those suffering from depression. It is apparent that anti-depres - sant drugs may not be doing a good enough job treating those afflicted with clinical depression. Boyden believes he can do better. With transcra - nial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a magnetic field is used to non-invasivel y excite neurons in the brain. TMS may one day be used as therapy for patients diagnosed with depression by stimulating the correct sets of neurons, leading to a happier, hopefull y healthier individual. Boyden also thinks that TMS may even one day be used as an outlet to incite creativity, due to TMS's ability to cause increased concentration and risky behavior. In addition, de - vices called brain pacemakers have been evaluated with re - gards to their ability to treat clinical depression. Already with applications for treating Parkinson's and epilepsy, brain pacemakers (which excite neurons deep in the brain with electrical impulses) have made some promising headway. If the critical brain areas are eventuall y isolated and targeted, depression sufferers may have finall y found a long-lasting reprieve. Says one of the earl y patients after her pacemaker was switched on, \"\"I'm starting to smile.\" Though the work of neuroengineers like Boyden and De - isseroth is on the cutting-edge of technology and science, we might be inclined to ask about the implications of this research. As we understand more and more about the intri - cacies of the 3.3 lb grayish pink mass in our skulls, will we begin to attribute our thoughts and emotions to an after-ef - fect of electrical spikes? As we exhibit more direct control over these neural circuits, are we considering how we can cause people not onl y to walk or see again, but to love or feel joy or sadness? Are we in danger of reducing oursel ves into the very machines that we have built to help us?

He has written over 450 journal articles and 10 books on climate change and has also lectured to first-year students in Frontiers of Science. We visited Wally in his office at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory on a rainy Friday morning to talk a little about his life, research and views on climate change.meet Wally Broeckerfaculty profile F all 2009 29 F aculty Pr ofile Q: you transferred to CoLumbia from whea ton CoLLege 53 years ago as an undergradua te and you've been here ever sinCe. wha t made you Choose CoLumbia? A: I didn't choose it, I was sent. At Wheaton, they had a sophomore assigned to each freshman to help them through orientation, a kind of mentoring program, and I was put with Paul Gast. He worried about me and thought I didn't have any life ambition. So he finall y got frustrated with me and arranged that I come to Columbia for an interview with a professor, and that professor hired me as a research assistant for the summer. At the end of that summer he got me transferred into Columbia in one day. He was interested in building a bigger and bigger research empire, and didn't have time to work on individual things. So within 6 months I was running his radiocarbon lab and I could do whatever I wanted to. It was a big opportunity. I loved it. Like going into a candy shop. Q: do You haVE anY adViCE for undErgradua t ES intErEStEd in rESEarCh CarEErS? A: Well, I think you should onl y do it if you reall y love it, cause the onl y way you'll do well is if you put in a lot of time. I don't think anyone's smart enough to be able to make their way into that level of science without working hard. And if you're going to work hard, you're going to have to sacrifice some other areas of your life. Q: How did you get started studying geology? A: I never knew anything about geology until I came to Columbia. I started in '52, and in the summer of '54 my professor was supposed to give a lecture on carbon dating to an archeology conference. At the last minute he decided he didn't want to go, so he sent me\u2014that was my first lecture in science. So I gave a lecture on radiocarbon dating. And afterwards, a guy with a potbell y and a pipe with a cigar butt stuck in it, and with cowboy boots on, just came up to me and said, 'look man, I see you know a lot about math and physics, but I can also see that you don't know a gall-darn thing about the earth. So' he said, 'you'll come with me for three weeks and I'll change your life.' And that's pretty much what he said\u2014just like that. So I asked him where we were going and he said, 'we're going to go look at remnant lakes at the Great Basin, Santa Rosa Island, I'll teach you some geology.\" I said I was married and I had hardl y any money so I couldn't afford it, and he said he'd pay my expenses. He was curator of the Santa Barbara museum of archeology, and you know what he wanted? Free carbon dates. So he sort of captured his own lab. He reall y opened my eyes to what you could learn as a field geologist. And that was reall y important because I put the two together. I'm mathematical to some extent, but I appreciate what you can learn in the field. Some people avoided putting the one with the other, and that was a mistake. Q: do You think tha t gEoEngin EEring iS thE anSWEr to thE Clima t E Chang E proBlEm? A: Y es. I mean we've got to do everything, but if we can't pull CO2 directl y out of the atmosphere and store it somewhere, we're not going to make it. I'm convinced of that. There just isn't enough al ternate energy-unless there's some miracle with solar or we go reall y heavy with nuclear. Klaus Lackner has the onl y system in the world that's an economicall y acceptable way to pull CO2 out of the air. He's the greatest scientist at Columbia. He was trained in particle physics, but he's in engineering because he decided along the way that the most important problem in the world was how to produce Ying Li & Elizabeth LindhardtColumbia Science Review 30 F aculty Pr ofile energy without putting carbon into the air. He knows how to do it. His system invol ves the fiber of a special chemicall y-active fabric that, when its exposed to air, takes up both CO2 and water. But if you take it and expose it to water, the water replaces the CO2\u2014kicks it off. Air would blow through this fabric, and the fibers would take out 30 percent of the CO2 in the air. Lackner says that everything that can be modular ought to be modular. Automobiles are modular\u2014 that's why we have such great automobiles. Every year they tinker around and make something a little bit better. So Lackner has made these units that look kind of like football goalposts with V enetian blinds, each of which will take out one ton of CO2 a day. Lackner also thinks we should keep running cars on liquid fuel, and then just collect the CO2 back from the air. Or, we could pre-collect the CO2 and make hydrogen in a nuclear reactor that could be combined with ethanol. Then the CO2 being released would have come from the atmosphere. That way there'd be no net. Lackner knows how to do that now, and he wants to further the development\u2014making the fibers thinner so they can be smaller and cheaper, and reused hundreds and hundreds of times. He thinks he could do the whole thing for an increase of 25 cents on every gallon of gasoline\u20142 cents a kilowatt-hour. But now he needs about 20 million dollars to make a prototype. Q: W ha t do You think aBout our goVErnmEnt'S Effort S to dEal With Clima t E Chang E? A: Well, they talk about limiting temperature increase to 2 degrees, but reall y they shouldn't be talking about temperature. They should be putting a limit on the CO2 content of the atmosphere. There are other things affecting the temperature. They're such a long way from looking at the problem realisticall y that it's going to be a battle. Thank heavens that we've got Obama; at least he and his people are reall y trying. But boy it's difficul t. If there's ever a treaty, the senate will have to ratify it and they're going to want to know: how do we verify that other countries are following the rules? And if CO2 levels go up, how are you going to figure out what happened? And unless we're extremel y lucky we're in for a big mess, not a catastrophe but a mess. Q: iS it fruStra ting to knoW hoW thE Clima t E proBlEm Could BE fixEd and not SEE tha t Chang E manif EStEd in poliCY? A: Well things are changing\u2014don't kid yourself\u2014it's not as if nothing has happened. I mean, if you look at the last 20 years, the attitude is steadil y and strongl y changing that this is a problem, it used to be somewhat of a joke , but even now half of the US doesn't think it's a problem\u2014the same half that doesn't believe in evolution. And if people don't believe in evolution, it's hard to believe they'll be concerned about global warming. I'm an optimist in general, but its hard to be optimistic about that. We're going to go through some grief for sure, and we're going to have to see the consequences before people are going to get serious about it I think.F all 2009 31 Perspectives Columbia Science Review 32 COLUMBIA "}
