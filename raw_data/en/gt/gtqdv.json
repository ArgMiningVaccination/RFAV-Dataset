We have availed ourselves of both in full measure. We thank all at the R oyal College who have assisted us in the preparation of this report and in particular for pr oviding us with an office. The major contributor to the cost of the enquiry has been the Wellcome Trust, with further contributions from the Animal Health Trust, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Re s e a r ch Council and the Association of V e t e r i n a r y Teachers and Research Workers. We have received much help and advice from a wide range of individuals and organizations. We would like to acknowledge all such help, and particularly that of the six Deans of the veterinary schools who have been very patient in supplying us with information. Our greatest debt is to our secretar y, Jeff Gill, who has earned the gratitude and admiration of all members of the Committee for the way he has administered this enquiry from its inception to the publication of this report. We welcome the opportunity to comment on the problems facing veterinary research, which are pressing. We hope therefore that our report will not only be read but also will lead to action. Selborne C h a i r man of the Committee of E n q u i r y into V e t e r i n a r y Re s e a rc h October 1997A C K N OW L E D G E M E N T S3S.1. Veterinary science is important to any society which is concerned about the health of farm and companion animals and the safety of food of animal origin. Veterinarians need research to understand new diseases and respond to public expectations of better care for animals. S.2. The arrangements for research into veterinary science are complex and fragmented. It is carried out in the universities (mainly but not wholly in the six university ve t e r i n a r y schools) and in specialized r e s e a rc h establishments. The state-sponsored Institute for Animal Health, the Moredun Research Institute and the Veterinar y Laboratories Agency of MAFF are major centres for studying the diseases of farm animals. Their work is complemented by that of the Animal Health T rust, a charitable body, which concentrates on horses and small companion animals, and the work of the Roslin Institute on farm animal genetics. S.3. G overnment funding for research comes from the Higher Education Funding Councils, BBSRC, MAFF and the Scottish Office. Charitable funding comes from the Wellcome T rust and from private benefactions through the Animal Health T rust and a range of other organizations concerned with animal welfare. There is some funding from industry and commerce, not only the pharmaceutical companies but also the bloodstock industry and agriculture. Total identifiable spending on research into animal health and welfare in G reat Britain in the public sector and the universities is \u00a360m - \u00a370m a year . S.4. A wide range of people and organizations have put views to us. Naturally these do not all concur, but there is a striking level of agreement on the major issues. These concern the engagement of the veterinary profession in research, the balance of effort in animal health research programmes, the relations between the different research institutions and the importance of the veterinary schools, along with their special financial challenges. S.5. We are told repeatedly that too few veterinarians ar e involved in research. Scientists who are not veterinar y graduates undertake a significant proportion of studies into animal health and welfare, but veterinarians do have aspecial contribution to make. Veterinary graduates with the right training and experience for public sector research appointments are in short supply, and young veterinarians who have taken up postgraduate studies tend not to pursue research careers after obtaining a doctorate. There ar e major concerns that undergraduate veterinary education is so focussed on preparation for practice that it does not giv e students a proper understanding of the roles of research in advancing veterinary science. S.6. Many of those who have expressed views on the balance and coverage of current r e s e a rch into animal health and w e l f a re disagree with the priorities adopted by the major funding bodies. Some think that public spending on farm animal health is too focussed on the infectious diseases which can be transmitted to man while too little attention is given to endemic conditions which h a ve a major impact on animal w e l f a re and the efficiency of production. A separate concern is that basic clinical re s e a rch on the main v e t e r i n a r y species falls into a funding g a p. Those who wish to carry out fundamental studies to a d vance biological science can compete for mainstr e a m re s e a rch funds from the R e s e a rch Councils and else w h e re ; the state supports strategic and applied work on the diseases of farm animals; but r e s e a rchers seeking to gain a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms in v e t e r i n a r y species face an uphill struggle to finance their work. In recent years there has been spectacular pr o g ress in understanding mechanisms at the level of the molecule and the cell, but if these insights are to be fully exploited for the benefit of clinical v e t e r i n a r y practice they need to be related to the animal species inv o l ve d . S.7. There are important questions concerning institutions: h ow can d e e p co-operation be fostered between the veterinary schools and between them and the free-standing research establishments? H ow can the funding of research be better co-ordinated? Much of the ground is well- trodden, notably in the Wildy Report which in 1987 urged the need for closer working relationships between the Institutes, the v e t e r i n a r y schools and the V e t e r i n a r y Investigation Service, and in the Riley Report which two years later recommended a concentration of the resources of the veterinary schools and educational co-operationS U M M A R Y OF FINDINGS4between them and the Institute for Animal Health and the Animal Health T rust. The arguments for co-operation ar e stronger than ever in the late nineties. S.8. The veterinary schools face a particular problem in that the financial regime within which they operate does not fully recognize all the different tasks which they p e rform. P r i m a r i l y , of course, they are univ e r s i t y d e p a r tments undertaking teaching and r e s e a r ch, and preparing veterinary graduates for practice. There is no state animal health service comparable with the NHS to provide a clinical setting for the training of veterinar y students, so the veterinary schools have to run their own clinics for this purpose. The clinical services pr ovided b y the schools cannot, ho wever, hope to be self-financing, because they must be organized for the benefit of teaching rather than the delivery of health care at minimum cost. The financial arrangements for higher education are not designed to co ver the full costs of clinical instruction, and as a result the veterinary schools face a gap in their accounts which they try to fill by maximizing income from fees for patient services. The effect, not surprisingly, is such a load on the clinical staff that time for research is squee zed to an unacceptably low level. The British veterinary schools ar e not alone in finding it difficult to combine the functions of a university department and a clinical training establishment: we heard of similar problems in the American veterinary colleges and the British dental schools. S.9. Our r e p o rt offers a number of detailed recommendations, which are listed below. We draw attention here to our main proposals. S.10. The first three recommendations concern undergraduate veterinary education. We believe that the universities and the R oyal College of Veterinary Surgeons should take a fresh look at course content, selection criteria and the r e q u i r ement to deliver graduates who are competent to practise. The perspective should be that veterinary students are highly talented young people who must receive a true university education, including wide exposure to research, no matter which branch of the profession they may later choose.S.11. Recommendation 6 is directed at those v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rchers who have drawn attention to the lack of funding for baseline clinical studies of the v e t e r i n a r y species. T h e y h a ve made an important point, and they should put f o rw a r d concrete proposals for new initiatives. We believe that the main funding bodies are ready to listen. S.12. In recommendation 7 we move, without apology, into an area which may seem some way r e m oved from our r e m i t : the funding of undergraduate clinical teaching. The clinical d e p a r tments of the v e t e r i n a r y schools should be the major c e n t r es for clinical r e s e a rch into animal health. Instead they lag behind the pre-clinical departments and the r e s e a rc h Institutes, because the clinical staff of the schools are p reoccupied with training tomorrow's v e t e r i n a r y practitioners and supervising the treatment of patients. T h e Deans of the schools have accurately diagnosed the flaw in their funding arrangements which gives rise to this unhappy state of affairs, but in our view they are mistaken in looking solely to the Government for a solution. The practising p rofession and its clients reap the main benefit from the e f f o rts which the universities devote to producing v e t e r i n a r y graduates who are ready for clinical practice, and it is they who should accept responsibility for some of the special costs which the higher education system incurs in the p rocess. T h e re are a number of ways in which the funding of the v e t e r i n a r y schools could be put on a sound basis and it is not for us to offer a detailed prescription, but we are in no doubt that it is unreasonable to expect the clinical academic staff of the schools to carry out excellent r e s e a rc h until clinical teaching is properly financed. S.13. Recommendations 9, 10 and 11 are all about making better use of scarce resources. Most of those who put views to us were agreed that expensive facilities should be shared, that the schools and state r e s e a rch institutions must d e velop complementary and collaborative r e s e a rc h programmes, and that links between the sectors should be fostered through such means as joint appointments. It is time to turn such N ew Year resolutions into practice. The carrot is the ability of a collaborative research group with a range of complementary skills to obtain project funding w h i c h would be beyond the reach of the individual5partners. The stick is the prospect of continuing decline in core budgets w h i c h will force institutions to focus on the areas where they can compete. S.14. Our last three recommendations concern consultation and co-ordination. The evidence we r e c e i ved identified deep-seated issues which will not be r e s o l ved simply by setting up more committees. The various bodies inv o l ve d with animal health r e s e a rch - the major funding bodies, the u n i versities, the specialist r e s e a rch organizations - have their own terms of r e f e rence and different priorities. In our discussions, how e ve r, we formed the clear impression that they did not spend enough time listening to each other. T h e r e is need for clear and coherent advocacy of the str o n g case for v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rc h . S.15. Our final recommendation is that in a y e a r's time the Royal College of V e t e r i n a r y Surgeons should bring together all the bodies affected by our recommendations to r e v i ew p ro g r ess. Such a r e v i ew will be valuable in its own right if it p romotes a better understanding between the par t i c i p a n t s . S.16. We make the following recommendations: (1) The veterinary schools should take steps to expose undergraduates to research and research role-models, b y encouraging and facilitating intercalated science studies so far as the cost constraints allow; by exposing students to research within the universities and research institutions through elective and vacation studies; and by developing s t ronger teaching links with university biological and medical departments and the state funded Institutes and laboratories, for instance through shared posts. (2) The v e t e r i n a r y schools should r e v i ew their undergraduate selection practices to ensure that potential students with an inclination to an academic and research career are included. The schools should seek the support of the RCVS for this change of emphasis. (3) The RCVS should review the requirement on the schools to produce veterinary graduates competent to practise without further training.(4) The major emplo yers of veterinarians in research should assess their veterinary recruitment needs and measures to meet them, and take stock collectively of current pr ovision for veterinary research training and career development, taking account of the needs of the other emplo yers of veterinarians in research. (5) Funding bodies considering applications for grants in veterinary science should judge them not only on the quality of science but also on the needs for understanding, prevention and treatment of disease in the target species. The need to integrate knowledge at a cellular and genetic level with whole animal function in the target species should be recognized. (6) Those engaged in research in the veterinary species should jointly make a case to BBSRC and other funding bodies for a special funding programme. (7) The veterinary schools, the profession and MAFF (as the major public sector user of the services of veterinar y graduates) should review the financial arrangements for clinical v e t e r i n a r y teaching. Those who benefit fr o m undergraduate veterinary education should contribute to the special costs of clinical teaching, so that clinical academic staff can combine a reduced teaching and service load with a proper involvement in research. (8) The funding bodies which sponsor or have an interest in ve t e r i n a r y re s e a r ch - notably BBSRC, MRC, the agriculture departments and the Wellcome Trust - should review the effectiveness and complementarity of their p rogrammes, giving the main r e s e a rch contractors an opportunity to contribute, and should repeat this exercise from time to time. (9) The r e s e a rch Institutes and v e t e r i n a r y schools should s h a re the use of existing specialized facilities and co-operate in making the case for new investment in centres of ex c e l l e n c e . (10) The v e t e r i n a r y schools, Institutes, gov e r n m e n t laboratories and V e t e r i n a r y In vestigation Centres should collaborate and, where appropriate, form regional gr o u p i n g s .6(11) Each veterinary school should develop its own areas of re s e a r ch based on the starred areas in the R e s e a rc h Assessment E xercises, pr ovided, of course, those areas continue to be actively pursued. These areas for each school should be agreed between the schools and published as statements of individual and common strategy. T h e ve t e r i n a r y schools should exploit the complementary strengths of other bodies. (12) The heads of the veterinary schools should set up aninterest group to represent the schools collectively in dealings with other bodies. (13) The heads of research in the bodies engaged in research into animal health and welfare should meet formally to promote collaboration and co-ordination. (14) The bodies affected by our recommendations should jointly review progress in a year 's time, the review being convened by the RCVS.7P.1. Research in the veterinary sciences is vital for several reasons. It enhances the health, welfare and usefulness of both production and companion animals. It safeguards the public from diseases spread from these animals in food and by other means. By comparative investigations it illuminates our understanding and management of human disease, for example in such areas as infections, cancer , genetics and reproduction. P.2. The Committee was set up by the R oyal College of Ve t e r i n a r y Surgeons \"to assess the current state and provision for veterinary science and research and to develop a strategy from which priorities can be determined, to ensure UK veterinary research and research training are at the forefront internationally and meet the nation 's needs in the futur e\". We were asked to report by the end of 1997. The composition of the Committee is set out in annex A. P.3. At the beginning of our Enquiry we invited views from the v e t e r i n a r y profession, the r e s e a r ch community, Government departments and other funding bodies, representative organizations, animal welfare bodies, animal health and pharmaceutical companies and other interested bodies and individuals. The text of our call for evidence is at annex B. In addition to receiving written submissions w e heard oral evidence during our meetings and listened to a wide range of views during visits. Annex C gives the names of those who put evidence to us and the establishments w e visited. Annex D notes the recommendations of earlier studies, annex E lists abbreviations, and annex F gives information on changes in the number of veterinar y graduates emplo yed in research in recent years.P.4. In inviting views we did not define the subject of our Enquir y, namely \" veterinary research\", not wishing to constrain the range of issues which those responding to our invitation might raise. In the event, the views put to us have related to two distinct topics. P.5. The first is veterinary research in the sense of studies of the health and welfare of those animal species which are the concern of veterinary practice. Such research may lie at any point on a broad spectrum from fundamental studies of the molecular biology of pathogens to clinical trials of ne w therapies, and is carried out by scientists who may or may not have a veterinary degree. We received evidence about gaps in research co verage and the difficulty of funding certain kinds of research into animal health. P .6. The second topic is the place of veterinarians in re s e a r ch. Under this head views w e re expressed on the lev e l of re c ruitment of v e t e r i n a r y graduates into r e s e a rc h c a reers, over opportunities for training and car e e r d e velopment for v e t e r i n a r y graduates in r e s e a rch, and on the special issues encountered by veterinarians in academic appointments seeking to combine r e s e a rch with clinical and other service wor k . P .7. Our r e p o rt first sets the scene by describing, in chapter 1, the main institutions inv o l ved in v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch and re s e a rch training. In chapter 2 we note issues identified and v i ews expressed in the evidence put to us, and also in r e p o rt s of earlier enquiries and r e v i ews which we consulted. T h e re p o rt then offers in chapter 3 our own analysis of the main issues and r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s .P R E FA C ECHAPTER 1: INSTITUTIONS AND FUNDING SYSTEMS INTRODUCTION 1.1. A wide range of bodies are engaged in or fund ve t e r i n a r y re s e a r ch, notably the university v e t e r i n a r y schools, other university departments, Gov e r n m e n t departments, Research Councils, the Higher Education Funding Councils in England and Scotland, statutory levy boards, research Institutes and charities. We have not sought to compile a full inventory but consider briefly below the part played by: the main bodies which fund veterinary research and re s e a rch training, namely the Higher E d u c a t i o n Funding Councils, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Medical Research Council, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department, industrial funding bodies, the Wellcome Trust and other charities; the main bodies which carry out veterinary research and provide r e s e a r ch training for v e t e r i n a r i a n s , namely the university veterinary schools, the relevant publicly-funded r e s e a r ch establishments and the Animal Health T rust. THE HIGHER EDUC ATION FUNDING COUNCILS 1.2. Universities receive core G overnment funding for teaching and research from the higher education funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales. The funding pays the salaries of the permanent staff and contributes to the costs of buildings, equipment, and other infrastructur e for teaching and research. The extra costs of particular research projects are met by the universities obtaining competitive research grants or contracts from a wide range of sources. In the case of the six veterinary schools, the Royal Veterinary College receives an allocation from the Higher Education Funding Council for England direct, but the other veterinary schools receive a share of the Funding Council r e s o u r ces allotted to their par e n tuniversities. Institutions generally have discretion to divide their Funding Council grants between subject areas as they think fit, although the sums allocated to each subject area are public knowledge. 1.3. Funding Council r e s o u r ces are almost entir e l y distributed in accordance with formulae which take account of the costs of teaching and the level and quality of research activity in the different institutions. Research quality is measured for this purpose by periodic research assessment exercises in which the output of each institution in each subject area is subject to peer revie w. Allocations for 1997/98 were sharply geared to ratings in the 1996 Research Assessment E xercise. THE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL 1.4. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) promotes basic, strategic and applied research and related postgraduate training in the area of biological systems. It does so mainly by sponsoring research Institutes and by supporting r e s e a r ch projects and p rogrammes, principally in the universities, thr o u g h competitive grants. 1.5. The eight BBSRC-sponsored research Institutes hav e an annual turno ver of \u00a3120m. The Council pr ovides 44% of their o verall research income, but the level of suppor t varies considerably between the institutions. The Institutes which carry out research on animal health are described later in this chapter. Research projects and programmes ar e funded through responsive-mode grants for basic and strategic research enhancing the science and engineering base (\u00a350m a year) and under strategic research initiatives underpinning user needs in agriculture, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food (\u00a326m a year). 1.6. A strategic programme on biological responses to stress (\u00a34.1m in 1996/97) co vers animal welfare, animal disease pathogenesis, the biology of the spongiform encephalopathies and aspects of plant disease. Current research supported by BBSRC in the areas of animal welfare and animal disease pathogenesis, other than the 8CHAPTER ONE spongiform encephalopathies, represents a total of \u00a33m in three-year grants, and annual spending under a special p rogramme on the spongiform encephalopathies is currently around \u00a32.5m. 1.7. BBSRC funds some 2000 PhD studentships at any time together with more advanced fellowship posts. T w e l ve studentships are currently held by v e t e r i n a r y graduates. 35% of new studentships are allocated to individual s u p e r visors and the rest distributed through allocations to u n i versity departments, r e s e a rch institutes and industrial companies: four allocated studentships went to the I n s t i t u t e for Animal Health and three to v e t e r i n a r y schools in 1996. THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL 1.8. The Medical Research Council (MRC) spent \u00a3305m in 1996/97 on research to maintain and impr ove human health. This is divided about evenly between support for grants and career awards and support for MRC Units and Institutes. Studies of animal health and systems can contribute to human medicine, and the Council currently supports 19 projects in the veterinary schools with anannual spend of \u00a371 0000. A small number of projects elsewhere use animals such as cattle, sheep and cats to elucidate aspects of human health. 1.9. MRC maintains liaison with BBSRC, for example in relation to: basic biology (for instance genome sequencing); farm animal zoonoses (notably the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies); the BBSR C / M R C N e u ropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh; health applications of biology and biotechnology (for instance, MRC supports the Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research); and research relevant to human nutrition. THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE,FISHERIES AND FOOD 1.10. The M i n i s t r y of Agriculture, Fisheries and F o o d (MAFF) commissions r e s e a rch in order to inform and implement policies, to provide scientific foresight and contribute to the identification of future policy options. 9Table 1. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: expenditure on animal health and welfare research. and control of other animal diseases 6783 5948 Farm animal welfar e 4148 3928 Meat and welfar e 25752 25450CHAPTER ONE 10Its re s e a rch on animal health serves principally to help p rotect the public from animal diseases which may affect human health, to protect animal w e l f a re, and to promote a c o m p e t i t i v e economy. The M i n i s t r y's re s e a rch pr o g r a m m e , as set out in the D e p a rtmental R e p o rt for 1997 (CM 3604), p rovides for total expenditure of some \u00a3123m in 1996/97 and \u00a3126m in 1997/98. F o recast expenditure on animal health and w e l f a re within these totals is set out in T able 1. 1.11. In recent years the emphasis of the programme has shifted away from the endemic diseases and disorders which are primarily of concern to producers, in favour of w o rk on diseases (including those introduced fr o m overseas) and pathogens which are of major policy importance because of their impact on public health. The Ministry advise that about half of the third head of expenditure, \"prevention and control of other animal diseases\", represents statutory work on animal diseases which pose major threats to the economic well-being of a g r i c u l t u r e. The other half includes r e s e a r ch on economically important endemic diseases and is aimed at improving diagnosis and control, primarily by vaccination. 1.12. Most of the M i n i s t r y's re s e a rch in this area is carried out by the V e t e r i n a r y Laboratories Agency, a Next S t e p s Agency formed in 1995 from the merger of the Central Ve t e r i n a r y Laboratory with the V e t e r i n a r y In ve s t i g a t i o n Se rvice. The main function of the Agency is the diagnosis and surveillance of livestock disease, through site i n vestigations, through laboratory testing at 14 V e t e r i n a r y In vestigation Centres, the Central V e t e r i n a r y Laboratory and the Lasswade V e t e r i n a r y Laboratory, and through the analysis of data. The Agency's running costs are curr e n t l y \u00a344m a year and it has some 1050 staff, about 650 of them being at the Central V e t e r i n a r y Laboratory. Most of the staff h a ve a scientific background, 67 being project leaders, and 90 of them are veterinarians. R e s e a rch, mostly at the Central V e t e r i n a r y Laboratory, employs about 20% of the A g e n c y 's re s o u r ces: the in-house r e s e a rch programme costs about \u00a39m, a third of this being for work on BSE. T h e Central V e t e r i n a r y Laboratory also commissions work fr o m s p e c i a l i z ed centres of excellence for particular purposes and has extensive and growing links with universities, in p a rticular the U n i versities of S u r rey and R e a d i n g .SCOTTISH OFFICE 1.13. The Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD) funds basic, strategic and applied research at the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes (SABRIs), the Scottish Agricultural College and the R oyal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The SABRIs are the Hannah Research Institute, the Macaulay Land Use R e s e a r ch Institute, the M o redun R e s e a rc h Institute, the R owett Research Institute and the Scottish Crop Research Institute. 1.14. The Department 's current research budget is \u00a349m, of which some \u00a343m is used for core support to the institutions through grant in aid. This core funding accounts for about 70% of the income of the SABRIs and 40% of that of the College. The remainder of the SOAEFD's research budget is allocated to the Flexible Fund and additional research projects and programmes. 1.15. The \"Scottish System\" is designed to: encourage co-operation between the sponsored bodies (which have complementary rather than ov e r l a p p i n g remits) and between them and other local r e s e a rc h p roviders, notably the universities; and e n s u r e that basic, strategic and applied r e s e a rch is linked with practical applications in end-user industries. Collaboration is facilitated by the Committee of Heads of Agricultural and Biological Organisations of Scotland, formed in 1994 to promote an integrated approach to biological, environmental and agricultural r e s e a rch and d e velopment, technology transfer and policy support. T h e members of the Committee r e p resent the SABRIs together with the Scottish Agricultural College, the Royal Botanic Ga rden Edinburgh, Fisheries R e s e a rch Se rvices, the F o re s t r y Commission R e s e a rch Division and the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency. The transfer of technology to the agricultural and other end-user industries is promoted by a range of mechanisms, including advisory services for farmers, the integration of r e s e a rch with further and higher education in a g r i c u l t u r e, and the setting up of commercial subsidiaries by most of the SABRIs to exploit their discov e r i e s .CHAPTER ONE 11THE HORSERACE BETTING LEVY BOARD 1.16. The Board is a statutory body which collects a levy from bookmakers and the Horserace Totalisator Board and applies it for the improvement of horseracing, the i m p r ovement of breeds, and v e t e r i n a r y science and education. Grants are usually made to veterinary schools, other university departments, r e s e a r ch Institutes and veterinary practices. Some \u00a31.5m (representing about 3% of the Boar d's total expenditure) was spent on veterinar y science and education in 1996/97. Of this about \u00a31m was spent on research to impr ove the health and welfare of the horse, particularly the T h o ro u g h b r ed, \u00a3140 000 on veterinary postgraduate research training leading to the PhD in r e l e vant fields, and the remainder on other veterinary purposes including specialist clinical training through residencies. The allocation for 1997/98 has been reduced to \u00a31.26m as a result of an expected fall in levy income, and the number of scholarships and residencies will be phased down from eight to six awards of each kind. 1.17. The Board seeks to support strategic and applied re s e a r ch. It does not provide long-term support for re s e a rch groups, but it contributes indirectly to the re s e a rch infrastr u c t u r e by making project grants. T h e s e may cover the provision of specialist equipment and occasionally accommodation. THE MILK DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL 1.18. The Council was set up under the Milk Development Council O rder 1995, SI 1995/356, following a producer poll which confirmed that a majority of dairy farmers wer e prepared to pay to ensure that the research funded by the Milk Marketing Boards would continue after they wer e wound up .The Council derives its income from a levy on milk produced for sale in G reat Britain, the levy having initially been set at 0.04p per litre and then reduced to 0.03p per litre raising approximately \u00a35.5m. T h e continuance of the levy must be appr oved from time to time by the producers collectively .The Council 's statutor y functions include those of promoting or undertaking research in the fields of milk production and consumption.Last year the Council allocated appr oximately \u00a31.6m to projects on infertility, mastitis, lameness and other diseases of dairy cattle. In addition a further \u00a31.5m has been allocated to research into impr oved nutrition, welfare and environmental issues. THE MEA TAND LIVESTOCK COMMISSION 1.19. The Commission sponsors research totalling \u00a32m to \u00a33m a year on behalf of the livestock and meat industries, using funds from levies collected at the point of slaughter of cattle, sheep and pigs and also from consultancy earnings. Some 90 projects are currently supported, the emphasis being on research which will lead to practical benefits within 3 - 5 years. Subjects include animal management, nutrition, breeding, welfare and disease. THE BRITISH EGG MARKETING BOARD RESEARCH AND EDUC ATION TRUST 1.20. The T rust was established with capital derived fr o m the demise of the British Egg M a rketing Board, the income f rom which is to be applied to r e s e a rch and education for the advancement of the production of hen or duck eggs. The T rustees apply the income of about \u00a390 000 per annum to support a Nuffield Scholarship each y e a r, six P h D students and a number of small pump-priming grants. THE WELLCOME TRUST 1.21. The Wellcome T rust spends about \u00a35m a year on veterinary research and research training. Two thirds of this support has taken the form of project and programme grants, the remainder being fellowship and scholarship awards for veterinary research and veterinary graduates. 1.22. The T rust seeks to promote collaboration between the biological sciences and human and v e t e r i n a r y medicine. To this end it has, in par t i c u l a r , invested more than \u00a35m in a Unit for Molecular Parasitology at the U n i versity of Gl a s g ow, based in the Science Faculty but with close linksCHAPTER ONE 12with medical r e s e a r chers and parasitologists in the ve t e r i n a r y school, and expects to invest more than \u00a33m in the R e s e a rch Centre in Comparative R e s p i r a t o r y Me d i c i n e in the U n i versity of Edinburgh, based in the v e t e r i n a r y school but with the medical school and M o redun R e s e a rc h Institute closely inv o l ved. The T rust also supports v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch outside the v e t e r i n a r y schools: about a quarter of its ve t e r i n a r y project and programme directed grants are held in university scientific and medical depar t m e n t s . 1.23. The T rust applies common criteria of scientific excellence to grant applications for veterinar y, medical and biological r e s e a r ch. It does not fund purely clinical investigation in either human or veterinary medicine. 1.24. The T r u s t's support for training and car e e r development of graduates with veterinary qualifications is mainly channelled through five schemes: standard scholarship awards: for full-time research in any appropriate university or research laboratory in the UK leading to a PhD in three years; scholarship awards in clinical r e s e a rch: for those wishing to obtain a postgraduate clinical training while undertaking r e s e a rch leading to a PhD. T h e a w a rds are for four years, 70% of the time being for re s e a rch and 30% for clinical training; f i ve - y ear scholarship/fellowship awards: for e xceptional graduates to study for a PhD outside the ve t e r i n a r y schools, the first three years being spent in a non-v e t e r i n a r y school laboratory and the last two years as a fellow in a department in a v e t e r i n a r y s c h o o l . ve t e r i n a r y fellowships: for v e t e r i n a r y graduates with a PhD or equivalent r e s e a rch experience or postdoctoral science graduates wishing to undertake r e s e a rch in a ve t e r i n a r y subject; re s e a rch career development fellowships: for v e t e r i n a r y graduates with postdoctoral r e s e a rch experience who h a ve already achieved substantial r e s e a rch success and wish to develop an independent r e s e a rch career while maintaining an active inv o l vement in clinical ve t e r i n a r y medicine. 1.25. Veterinarians may also apply for awards designed fornon-veterinary scientists and for medical graduates, and for the T rust's multidisciplinary Senior Clinical Fellowships and Senior Basic Biomedical Fellowships. Currently, 54 ve t e r i n a r y graduates hold the Tr u s t's ve t e r i n a r y Ph D scholarships, 15 hold postdoctoral veterinary fellowships and three hold veterinary research career development fellowships. A further 19 individuals hold awards for veterinary research made through the T rust's personal support schemes for science and medical graduates. OTHER CHARITIES 1.26. Veterinary education, research and research training receives significant support from a range of other charities with varying objects, many of them concerned with the welfare of particular species of companion animals. Three examples may be given: the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which commissions r e s e a r ch on canine health and reproduction from the veterinary schools and the Animal Health T rust to the value of some \u00a365 0000 a year; the Home of Rest for Horses, which has made grants to the veterinary schools and the Animal Health T rust, including capital grants for the impr ovement of clinical facilities, totalling \u00a36.3m o ver the last 30 years; and the Pet Plan Charitable T rust, funded by voluntar y \u00a31 donations from owners paying healthcare insurance premiums for their pets plus a contribution from the company itself. Since the T rust was set up in 1994 it has made grants totalling \u00a329 7000 for research and postgraduate education in the veterinar y schools and the Animal Health T rust and given \u00a3360000 for new infrastructure in the schools. 1.27. The Home of Rest for Horses, like other animal welfare charities, does not fund research which involves invasive surgical or manipulative procedures. 1.28. From time to time v o l u n t a r y support may be mobilized for a specific research purpose. An example wasCHAPTER ONE 13the creation in 1986 of the Equine Virology Research Foundation to raise funds for research into the control of viral diseases and in particular equine herpesvirus. THE VETERINARY SCHOOLS 1.29. T h e re are six v e t e r i n a r y schools in Great Britain, in the U n i versities of Bristol, Cambridge, E d i n b u r g h , Gl a s g o w, Liverpool and London (where the v e t e r i n a r y school is the Royal V e t e r i n a r y College - RVC). They award first degrees which qualify their holders to practise as veterinarians, they provide postgraduate education andre s e a rch training for v e t e r i n a r y, medical and biological graduates, and they carry out a significant amount of re s e a rch into basic biomedical sciences and animal health. The schools are by no means staffed ex c l u s i v ely by veterinarians but they are significant employers of v e t e r i n a r y graduates, with 481 as staff or postgraduate students c o m p a r ed to over 9000 in general practice. Table 2 indicates the scale on which the schools operate. 1.30. The undergraduate course normally extends o ver fiv e years (six at Cambridge) embracing pre-clinical studies of animal structure and function, para-clinical studies of the nature of disease, and clinical medicine and surger y.TheCHAPTER ONE Table 2.

Notes: The staff and expenditure figures for Bristol and Cambridge relate only to the clinical v e t e r i n a r y schools and do not c over pre- and para-clinical departments. The annual expenditure figure for RVC, which is a financially independent institution, includes overheads some of which may be carried by the parent university in the case of the other v e t e r i n a r y schools.14parts of the course are not rigidly compartmentalized, and students handle and examine animals from the first year . Students complete 12 weeks of animal husbandry extramural studies during the first two years of the course and 26 weeks of clinical extramural studies during the last three years. The course co vers all the main domestic and agricultural species. 1.31. At the end of the second or third year students may take an honours science degree in one year before completing the veterinary course. At the University of Cambridge all veterinary students obtain a BA degree at the end of the first three years before completing the veterinary course. 1.32. The veterinary schools spend about \u00a317m a year onexternally-funded research in a wide range of areas co vering the interests of the pre-clinical, para-clinical and clinical departments. The quality of the research is evaluated periodically in the Research Assessment E xercises of the Higher Education Funding Councils. Table 3 sets out the results for the veterinary schools in 1992 and 1996. 1.33. The rating of 4 achieved by all the veterinary schools in 1996 indicated: \"research quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in virtually all sub-areas of a c t i v i t y , possibly showing some evidence of international excellence, or to international level in some and at least national level in a majority\". 1.34.

The Institute of Zoology is a grant-aided Institute of the University of London with an annual income in 1996 of \u00a32.4m, including research grants and contracts of \u00a3750000. The Institute employs seven veterinarians in strategic research and clinical investigations. Research areas include the causes of mortality in stranded cetaceans and the common frog, the pathology of spongiform encephalopathy in kudu, the epidemiology of parapo xvirus infection in red and grey squirrels, reproduction in porcine species and the health and welfare of mammals and birds in translocation programmes. Staff collaborate with many other universities and Institutes, both nationally and internationally, for example with the Moredun ResearchInstitute on parapox v i rus infections and the CSIRO Animal Health Laboratory in Australia on amphibian disease. Clinical investigations into the health and diseases of captive wild animals include projects on the prevalence of malignant catarrhal fever in deer and antelope. RESEARCH INSTITUTES SPONSORED BY BBSRC 1.38. BBSRC's sponsored Institutes include four engaged in work directly or indirectly relevant to animal health: the Institute for Animal Health studies infectious diseases of farm animals: annual income is \u00a318m; the Roslin Institute studies the productivity, breeding and welfare of farm animals, focussing particularly on the genetics of farm animals in the UK. Annual turno ver is \u00a310m; the Institute of Grassland and E n v i ro n m e n t a l Re s e a rch undertakes basic and strategic r e s e a rc h re l e vant to grassland agriculture, including a substantial programme of work on r u m i n a n t s . Annual turno ver is \u00a313m; the Babraham Institute studies physiology at all levels, but with particular focuses upon cell biology and system physiology. It is no longer engaged in veterinary research. Annual turno ver is \u00a314m. 1.39. The Institute for Animal Health comprises three laboratories, at Compton (endemic diseases, including those of poultry), Pirbright (exotic diseases that threaten the UK) and the BBSRC/MRC Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies). The Compton site was extensively r e d e veloped to accommodate the poultry science which mo ved from the former Houghton Laborator y, and the Pirbright site is the subject of a major current redevelopment programme. The I n s t i t u t e 's assets include advanced containment facilities for work with dangerous pathogens and unique animal stocks of known health status and genotype. I t employs around 500 staff, 100 of these being postdoctoral scientists (including 11 veterinarians). There are also about 60 postgraduate students, three being veterinarians. The Institute is an associated institution of the Universities 15CHAPTER ONE of Bristol and Reading. 1.40. The Roslin Institute was formed by the amalgamation of separate organizations conducting research into animal breeding and into poultry science, and these are still the main areas of focus. Current research on breeding co vers theoretical and applied genetics, genome mapping with an eye to economically important traits, genetic modification, r e p ro d u c t i v e physiology and immunogenetics, while remaining work on poultry concerns welfare, metabolic and developmental disorders and nutrition. There are some 300 staff, including 30 research leaders (two of whom are veterinarians), and 30 students. The BBSRC strategic grant of \u00a31.8m represents a fifth of total income; MAFF provides two fifths in contracts; the chief sources of project funding are BBSR C and the agriculture D e p a rtments, together with the agricultural industry (including levy boards) and the European Commission. The main site, part of which is being developed as a biotechnology centre, is on the outskirts of Edinburgh close to the Moredun Foundation 's Pentland Science Park, the University 's veterinary field station and the Edinburgh Veterinary Investigation Centre. The Institute is an associated institution of the University of Edinburgh and collaborates in r e s e a r ch with the veterinary school and a wide range of other bodies. 1.41. The Institute of Grassland and E n v i ro n m e n t a l Re s e a rch occupies three sites in central Wales, including a re s e a rch farm, and one site in north D e von. T h e r e are some 400 staff, of whom about 110 are postdoctoral re s e a rch initiators, and about 40 postgraduate students; t h e re are no v e t e r i n a r y graduates. T wo thirds of the In s t i t u t e 's funding is derived from MAFF contracts and the BBSRC strategic grant of \u00a32m r e p resents only a fifth of the annual turnov e r. Studies of animal nutrition, grazing behaviour and the conversion of plant fibre to meat, milk and wool account for about a third of the re s e a r ch budget. The Institute has collaborated with the ve t e r i n a r y school of the U n i versity of Edinburgh, the Mo redun R e s e a rch Institute, the Roslin Institute and the Ve t e r i n a r y Laboratories Agency in r e s e a rch projects, and t h e re are teaching and r e s e a rch links with the U n i ve r s i t i e s of Wales (particularly the U n i versity College ofAb e rystwyth), Plymouth and Reading (40 members of staff being inv o l ved in undergraduate teaching). 1.42. The Babraham Institute has focussed its work in recent years on cell signalling, recognition mechanisms, and development and genetics, while pr o g r a m m e s specifically related to agriculture and animal w e l f a re are being phased out. The Institute is sited near Cambridge and linked with the U n i versity: Institute staff teach on some undergraduate courses, and postgraduate students read for Cambridge PhDs at the Institute. T h e r e are re s e a r ch collaborations with a wide range of UK and overseas universities. The Institute has about 500 staff, including some 50 project leaders and 140 postdoctoral s t a f f, and 60 postgraduate students. T wo members of staff a re ve t e r i n a r y graduates. The BBSRC strategic grant of \u00a37.5m r e p resents just over half of total income; other s o u rces of funding include project grants from BBSR C , M RC, MAFF and other Government departments. T h e In s t i t u t e 's assets include a large site on which it r e n t s space to biotechnology companies working in r e l e va n t subject ar e a s . RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENTS SPONSORED BY SCOTTISH OFFICE 1.43. The following institutions funded by Scottish Office are particularly relevant: the Moredun Research Institute conducts basic and strategic research on the biology of infectious disease in sheep and other economically important grazing animals. Annual expenditure is \u00a35m; the Hannah Research Institute studies lactation, milk and dairy products and related subjects, including the welfare of dairy cattle. Annual expenditure is some \u00a34m; the R owett Research Institute studies mammalian nutrition with particular emphasis on the effects of diet on health. Annual expenditure is \u00a311m; the Scottish Agricultural College engages in education, re s e a rch and technology transfer. Annual expenditure is about \u00a345m. 16CHAPTER ONE 171.44. The M o redun R e s e a rch Institute was established in 1926 by the Animal Diseases R e s e a rch Association. T h e Association became the M o redun Foundation, of which the Institute is a wholly owned subsidiary. Since the 1950s the Institute has r e c e i v ed grants from Scottish O f f i c e , some three quarters of the I n s t i t u t e 's income curr e n t l y being from that source. It employs 250 staff, of whom 50 a re scientists (including 13 veterinarians), and has 20 re s e a rch students. T h e r e are links with the U n i versities of Edinburgh and G l a s g o w and with the Scottish Agricultural College. 1.45. In 1988 the M o redun Foundation formed a s u b s i d i a r y company to develop the commer c i a l exploitation of the Institute 's research. The Foundation is now using the proceeds of the phased sale of the original large site on the outskirts of Edinburgh and a grant from the European Regional Development Fund to develop the Pentlands Science P a rk. The Science P a rk will accommodate the Institute and other biological organizations and adjoins the University of Edinburgh Veterinary Field Station and the Edinburgh Veterinar y Investigation Centre of the Scottish Agricultural College. The Foundation manages high specification containment facilities at the Science Park for the use of the Institute and other clients. 1.46. The Hannah Research Institute, founded in 1928, is located at Ayr but has close links with the University of Glasgow 40 miles away. Research is focussed in the areas of c o n t r ol of the mammary gland, control of nutrient partitioning in pregnancy and lactation, fetal programming and development, w e l f a re of dairy cows (including lameness), food quality and safety, and molecular interactions in milk and food processing. There are some 150 staff, including about 40 postdoctoral scientists but no ve t e r i n a r y graduates, and 20 postgraduate students. Scottish Office grant represents about three quarters of total income. There are research and teaching links with the Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde, and other re s e a r ch partners include other UK universities, the Scottish Agricultural College, the Babraham, Moredun, Roslin and R owett Institutes, and a range of o verseas research groups.1.47. The R owett Research Institute was founded in 1913 on a site near Aberdeen and was supervised initially by a joint committee appointed by the North of Scotland College of Agriculture and the University of Aberdeen. The original remit was to study animal nutrition, but an integrated programme of research on human and animal nutrition was pursued from the outset. The main current research themes are energy balance, gastroenterology, gut reactivity and immune function, protein metabolism and muscle function, nutrient-gene interactions in development, the maintenance of cellular function, and skeletal gr owth and bone turno ver.The Institute 's assets include a farm with large animal facilities and a small animal unit with specialized stocks of laboratory animals. Two thirds of its income comes from Scottish Office, the balance being co vered mainly from project grants (15%) and from work carried out for R owett Research Services, the Institute 's research company (10%). There are some 280 staff, of whom 80 are inno vative scientists. Two members of staff are veterinarians, but they are not primarily engaged in research. The Institute is host to about 100 postgraduate students, mostly registered with the University of Aberdeen, and Institute staff are involved in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching at the University .There are collaborative research links with other members of the Aberdeen Research Consortium (which brings together the University of Aberdeen, Robert Gordon University, the Scottish Agricultural College and other research institutes), with other establishments supported b y Scottish Office, and with o verseas research groups. 1.48. The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) combines teaching with major advisory, consultancy and scientific s e rvices along with r e s e a rch on animal and plant science, c rop protection, food technology, economics, engineering, soils and environmental science. T h e r e are 1350 staff. J u s t under 50% of the r e s e a rch programme is funded by the Scottish Office. Animal science accounts for 36% of the re s e a r ch income, the main areas cov e red being the genetics and r e p roduction of farm livestock, the metabolism of ruminants, pigs and poultry, and animal health, behaviour and w e l f a re. SA C 's assets include seven r e s e a rch farms and the eight v e t e r i n a r y laboratories of the V e t e r i n a r y Science Division, which provides v e t e r i n a r y surgeons in practiceCHAPTER ONE 18with advisory, clinical and diagnostic services similar to those provided in England and Wales by the MAFF Ve t e r i n a r y In vestigation Centres. The staff of SAC Ve t e r i n a r y Se rvices include 30 v e t e r i n a r i a n s . THE ANIMAL HEALTH TRUST 1.49. The T rust is an independent charitable organization which seeks to develop better means of diagnosing, treating and pr e venting disease in horses and small animals. It pursues research, referral services and education, with long-term, strategic research being the main activity .The Trust employs 180 staff, 36 being veterinarians. The annual income is o ver \u00a36m, derived from research grants, clinical s e rvices and charitable income. The T rust is seeking recognition as an \"academic analogue\" eligible for BBSR C grants. Over \u00a310m is currently being spent to concentrate the T rust's infrastructure on the larger of its two sites outside N ewmarket. 1.50. The forerunner of the present T rust, set up in 1942, established not only an Equine Research Station and a Small Animal Centre but also a Poultry Research Station and a Farm Livestock Station, but there was little success in raising funds from the agricultural industry for the last two enterprises. The P o u l t r y Re s e a r ch Station was t r a n s f e r r ed to the Agricultural R e s e a r ch Council, its activities ultimately being taken o ver by the Institute for Animal Health, and the Farm Livestock Station closed in 1971. The development of the T rust as it now stands reflects continued support from equine and companion animal interests and individual donors. RESEARCH SPENDING 1.51. It would be difficult to give an accurate measure of c u r rent expenditure on r e s e a rch into animal health and we l f a re in view of the wide range of bodies inv o l ved and the lack of any clear boundary between such r e s e a rch and neighbouring areas. The information quoted above n e ve r theless gives a broad picture. The spendingp rogrammes of BBSRC, MAFF , SOAEFD, the W e l l c o m e T rust and the industrial funding bodies add up to \u00a340m to \u00a350m a year for r e s e a rch into animal health and w e l f a re . This figure does not take account of the contribution of the Higher Education Funding Councils in supporting r e s e a rc h i n f r a s t ru c t u r e in the v e t e r i n a r y schools and other univ e r s i t y d e p a r tments, or of r e s e a rch funds from other sources such as the animal w e l f a re societies or pharmaceutical companies. The annual r e s e a rch spending of the v e t e r i n a r y schools, the Institute for Animal Health, MAFF , the Animal H e a l t h T rust and the M o redun R e s e a rch Institute adds up to \u00a350m to \u00a360m, and r e l e vant expenditure by bodies not p redominantly engaged in r e s e a rch on animal health and we l f a re may total some \u00a310m. Annual spending on r e s e a rc h on animal health and w e l f a re in Great Britain ther e f o re seems likely to be in the region of \u00a360m to \u00a370m. 1.52. A comparison with medical r e s e a rch is instr u c t i ve. Ju s t four of the medical schools (The Royal Free Hospital, St G e o r g e 's Hospital, UMDS and U n i versity of W a l e s ) b e t ween them r e c e i ved \u00a360m in 1995/96 from r e s e a rc h grants and contracts, and (as noted earlier) MRC alone i n vested \u00a3305m in r e s e a rch and r e s e a rch training in 1996/97. 1.53. Spending on v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch may also be put into the context of its economic importance. The Annual Abstract of Statistics shows that in 1995 the output of l i vestock and livestock products in the UK was worth ov e r \u00a3 10 200m. The Institute for Animal Health has cited an estimate that, in the developed world, disease in farm animals costs around 17% of turnover in mortality and m o r b i d i t y . For the UK, that would imply regular losses of the order of \u00a31700m a y e a r. Ou t b reaks of par t i c u l a r serious diseases can lead to heavy public expenditure as well: thus the MAFF D e p a rtmental R e p o rt for 1997 re c o rds that the estimated cost to public funds of measur e s taken to deal with BSE in 1996/97 was \u00a31370m, fur t h e r e x p e n d i t u r e totalling \u00a31800m being planned over the next t h ree years. It would be difficult to use such figures to establish the need for a particular level of investment in animal health r e s e a r ch, but annual expenditure of less than 1% of the value of the production of the livestock industry seems modest.CHAPTER ONE 20CHAPTER 2:VIEWS RECEIVED BY THE COMMITTEE INTRODUCTION 2.1. This chapter summarizes the main messages which w e derived from written and oral evidence put to us, and also from the reports of earlier enquiries (noted in annex D). The views expressed and issues identified are presented in this chapter topic by topic. 2.2. We deal first with the subject of veterinarians in research, under the following headings: need for veterinary contribution in research; research exposure and basic science in undergraduate education; re s e a r ch training of those with a v e t e r i n a r y qualification; and c a reers in r e s e a r ch for those with v e t e r i n a r y qualifications. The chapter then r e p o rts the issues which w e re raised on re s e a rch into animal health and w e l f a re, under the headings: coverage of different areas of research; requirements of clinical research; research by clinicians in the veterinary schools; research and general practice; funding of research; funding strategy and co-ordination; competition, collaboration and specialization; comparison with American experience; and comparison with human academic medicine and dentistr y. Particular themes falling under these headings ar epicked out in italics. NEED FOR VETERINARY CONTRIBUTION IN RESEARCH 2.3. The v e t e r i n a r y schools and r e s e a r ch I n s t i t u t e s , including the Animal Health T rust, are staffed by peoplewhose first and higher degrees span many disciplines. T h re e fifths of the permanent staff of the schools have v e t e r i n a r y qualifications. A fifth of the staff of the Animal Health T r u s t a re ve t e r i n a r y graduates, while the Institutes r e f e r red to in chapter 1 employ v e ry few: a little over 1% of their staff. Veterinarians are seen as making a special contribution, i n p a rticular in that they have combined expertise in clinical practice and fundamental biology. The British V e t e r i n a r y Association (BVA) expressed the general view: \"Whilst non- veterinarians make a huge contribution to v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch, appropriate disease r e s e a rch re q u i r es a balanced and r e l e vant multidisciplinary approach in which veterinarians should play an essential part\". The Animal Health T rust saw a particular need for veterinarians in re s e a rch because of their strengths in comparative medicine and epidemiology. The Wellcome T rust told us that much of the v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch which it financed was done by n o n - v eterinarians, but the T rust nev e rtheless took the view that r e s e a rchers with v e t e r i n a r y training had a v e ry specific contribution to make and that, for instance, r e s e a rch in ve t e r i n a r y pathology called for v e t e r i n a r y training. 2.4. T h e re was similarly general agreement that too few veterinarians w e re engaged in r e s e a rch. Professor W i l d y's Wo rking P a rty (see annex D) identified a chronic shortage of good v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rchers, and Professor P i c k e r i n g 's gro u p (see annex D) made recommendations on r e c ruitment of ve t e r i n a r y scientists. In evidence to us BVA said that there had been a decrease in the number of veterinarians inv o l ve d in re s e a rch in the Institutes and the v e t e r i n a r y schools; the information in annex F supports this. The Association fear e d that for lack of their contribution r e s e a rch would be less re l e vant and r e s p o n s i v e to the needs of animals and a g r i c u l t u r e, ve t e r i n a r y students would be less drawn to re s e a rch careers and there would be less communication b e t ween practitioners and r e s e a rchers. The Wellcome T r u s t said that its v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch and r e s e a rch training f e l l owships w e re undersubscribed, and even allowing for the re l a t i v ely small size of the field the T rust felt that there w e re too few outstanding figures who combined v e t e r i n a r y and re s e a rch skills of high quality . 2.5. MAFF estimated that five or six veterinary graduates needed to be recruited into a research career each year toCHAPTER T WO 21maintain the present complement of researchers with veterinary qualifications in the public sector (principally the agriculture Departments and the Research Council Institutes). There was a particular shortage of research epidemiologists, pathologists and microbiologists with veterinary training. Respondents from the pharmaceutical industry similarly said there was difficulty in finding veterinarians with postgraduate training in relevant science subjects. Fewer seemed to be trained in such basic disciplines as immunology, pathology, bacteriology and v i rology or in whole animal science, and v e t e r i n a r y graduates joining industry did not have as good a command of fundamental r e s e a rch techniques as did holders of biological science doctorates. RESEARCH EXPOSURE AND BASIC SCIENCE IN UNDERGRADU ATE EDUCATION 2.6. The pre-registration training of veterinarians falls outside our remit, but the arrangements for undergraduate veterinary education pr oved to have a bearing on our enquir y.This was partly because the veterinary schools ar e the conduits (to quote P rofessor Lanyon) through which young people in the UK pass in order to become veterinarians. Those who teach veterinary undergraduates have the opportunity to prepare and enthuse some of them for careers in research. We were also told, ho wever, that ve t e r i n a r y education should take place in a r e s e a rc h environment, even for those students who are destined for practice. The latter view was authoritatively advanced in two of the existing reports we consulted: the Riley Repor t and the Lucke Report (see annex D). 2.7. Sir Ralph Riley 's Working Party recommended that veterinary graduates should have a broad education in the basic sciences in order to be able to keep pace with the developments likely to take place during their careers. The Wo rking P a rty saw r e s e a r ch and the training of postgraduate research students as a necessary background to undergraduate teaching, and favoured the development of clinical research to the benefit of undergraduate and postgraduate teaching. The report recommended that the Institute for Animal Health and the Animal Health T rustshould be involved in undergraduate education because of their special capability in relation to infectious diseases. 2.8. Dr Lucke 's Working Party put forward similar views, the central theme of the Report being that veterinar y education should concentrate on \"an understanding of biological principles and the scientific assessment of information rather than acquiring immediate technical competence\". The Working Party feared that the volume of knowledge undergraduates were expected to acquire might squee ze out the development of their po wers of reasoning and deduction. Their view was that the curriculum should maximize comprehension, if necessary at the expense of proficiency and comprehensive knowledge, and all students should obtain a firm understanding of the scientific basis of all subjects in the curriculum in order to pr ovide a sound basis for later development. Further encouragement should be given to the intercalation of degrees within the veterinary course, the subjects taken being wide in scope. 2.9. Dr L u c k e's W o rking P a rty made a number of recommendations particularly r e l e vant to our enquiry. T h e ve t e r i n a r y schools should be enabled to establish centres of e xcellence, on the basis of species or discipline, and m ovement of undergraduates between the schools should be facilitated so that they could work in a centre of ex c e l l e n c e outside their own school. Maximum use should be made of the fund of expertise and goodwill available from the p rofession at large. Students w e re to be allowed, or ev e n encouraged, to take elective periods away from their schools, possible locations being non-clinical univ e r s i t y d e p a r tments, r e s e a rch Institutes, MAFF laboratories and specialist practices. The W o rking P a rty saw r e s e a rch as an a p p ropriate use of an elective period, and invited the R C V S to seek, with the universities, to find ways of providing a c a reer str u c t u r e for teachers in the v e t e r i n a r y schools which would stimulate basic and clinical r e s e a rch. The W o rk i n g Pa rty recommended that, in order to attract clinicians with open and enquiring minds, clinical departments should a l l ow them opportunities for r e s e a rch so as to advance their subjects and provide a high standard of clinical car e . 2.10. In the evidence put to us there was wide agreement on the importance of exposing v e t e r i n a r y undergraduates toCHAPTER T WO 22re s e a rch concepts and methods, not only in order to influence some of them to go on to careers in r e s e a rch. O n e respondent urged that students should be exposed to re s e a r ch and the application of r e s e a r ch data, being stimulated by teachers actively engaged in r e s e a rch and being encouraged to participate in or at least observe re s e a rch carried out by their teachers. Another took the view that r e s e a rch methods, especially quantitative analysis, w e re as pertinent in practice as in the r e s e a rch laboratory. M o d e s t scholarships might usefully be given for vacation r e s e a rc h p rojects (as was commonly done in the United States and in other subjects), or some elective periods might be used for re s e a rch studies, not necessarily within the school. 2.11. P rofessor Pickering 's group recommended stronger links between the Institutes and the veterinary schools, and the Moredun Research Institute told us that it had taken three or four undergraduates on Wellcome Trust vacation studentships each year for the last ten years (though sadly with no evidence that any of the visitors had been prompted to enter research careers). We heard also from a number of sources about the high-quality research summer schools organized by the University of Cornell for selected veterinary undergraduates, and we are aware that ther e have been proposals, as yet unsuccessful, for similar courses based in the UK. 2.12. In t e rcalated studies, in which undergraduates take a year out of the v e t e r i n a r y course in order to read for an honours science degree, w e re agreed to be a valuable way to stimulate students and give them a deeper scientific training, though they carry a cost. A number of submissions expr e s s e d disappointment that r e l a t i v ely few undergraduates (outside Cambridge, where the T ripos system r e q u i r es all v e t e r i n a r y students to take a science degree en route to their v e t e r i n a r y qualification) chose to take the extra year: we heard that medical students w e re more inclined to take an inter c a l a t e d d e g ree because this is seen as part of a standard career path. 2.13. In view of the consensus that undergraduate ve t e r i n a r y education should take place in a r e s e a rc h environment we were sorry to learn that undergraduate veterinary courses were not generally thought to prepare or motivate students for a research career .One explanation ofthis was the large, and gr owing, mass of information which students had to absorb in order to obtain a first degree entitling them to be registered to practise in any branch of the profession without further training. During our visits we met a number of young veterinarians who had taken intercalated science degrees, and we heard how during the clinical phase of their undergraduate studies they had had to return to cramming facts and stop questioning what they were told. The students perceived the undergraduate course as strongly directed toward practice, and although aware that research was pursued in the veterinary schools they saw it as something which happened elsewhere and was not accessible to them. 2.14. The veterinary schools did not accept it as inevitable that v e t e r i n a r y undergraduates should be trained for practice to the exclusion of a grounding in science and e x p o s u r e to r e s e a r ch. The U n i versity of Bristol, for example, had adopted the aim of equipping veterinar y students for a career in biomedical or veterinary science, encouraging a significant proportion to take an honours science degree by intercalation. 2.15. T h e r e was general concern about the m o t i v ation of ve t e r i n a r y students, most of whom w e re seen as fixed on the aim of entering practice. One view was that students would be more inclined to take advantage of the opportunities for i n t e rcalation and postgraduate study if they saw a clear c a reer path in r e s e a rch and w e re exposed to suitable r o l e models. In the event their exposure to r e s e a rch was limited because the public sector r e s e a rch establishments stood a p a rt from the v e t e r i n a r y schools. Another factor was that a p ro p o r tion of v e t e r i n a r y students shared the r e s e rvations of many of their contemporaries over animal experimentation. 2.16. A number of the faculty members we met during visits to the v e t e r i n a r y schools drew attention to the c r i t e r i a adopted in selecting school-leavers for the undergraduate course. The competition was such that, in addition to high academic qualifications, the schools looked for signs of practical aptitude and motivation for working with animals, as evidenced by time spent on attachments to farms or ve t e r i n a r y practices. The selection of undergraduates was thus biased in favour of young people who w e re likely to beCHAPTER T WO 23drawn to a career in practice, and their subsequent training did little to change this emphasis. RESEARCH TRAINING OF THOSE WITH AVETERINAR Y QUALIFIC ATION 2.17. The PhD was seen as the basic qualification for an academic r e s e a r ch car e e r. The Faculty of V e t e r i n a r y Medicine of the U n i versity of Edinburgh thought four- year PhD courses desirable for v e t e r i n a r y graduates who had not taken intercalated science degrees, the first y e a r of the doctoral course being devoted mainly to course w o rk. Some respondents felt that clinical v e t e r i n a r i a n s needed a qualification more akin to the MD. Value was also seen in short but intensive workshop courses of the kind which had been successful in human medicine, for instance in epidemiology. 2.18. The British Small Animal Veterinary Association expressed concern o ver the protracted training period for clinical research. In the Association 's view the veterinar y schools relied on junior clinicians in residency posts to assist with clinical services and were not able to give them adequate opportunity for or training in research. This meant that a young clinician with research ambitions had first to spend at least three years in a clinical training post in order to obtain an RCVS specialist Diploma, then go on to doctoral studies in order to learn research methodology , and then take up a postdoctoral post, all on low salaries. 2.19. It was suggested that some postgraduate students sought a doctorate with the intention of pursuing an academic clinical career rather than r e s e a rch, while others took up doctoral studies because they had found practice unsatisfying but w e re not necessarily committed to a career in re s e a rch. Our conversations with postgraduate students during visits tended to support this view, few of them being firmly set on r e s e a rch careers. One respondent observed that the current trend in clinical medicine was to gain the R C V S specialist qualifications as well as a PhD, hard though it might be to envisage a position which would make good use of all those skills: he suggested that it might be time to r e c o g n i z e d i f f e r ent qualifications for teachers and r e s e a rc h e r s .CAREERS IN RESEARCH FOR THOSE WITH VETERINAR Y QUALIFIC ATIONS 2.20. T h e r e was v e ry general agreement that y o u n g veterinarians could not see a coherent structure for a research career and were deterred as a result. 2.21. Most of the students we spoke to thought it desirable to enter practice for two or three years f o l l ow i n g graduation, even if the intention was to pursue a d i f f e r ent car e e r. The experience of diagnosis and t reatment was seen as consolidating the clinical skills which w e re the particular asset of the v e t e r i n a r y scientist. The evidence we r e c e i v ed from the academic world was generally sympathetic to this view, and those who returned to do postgraduate studies after a short spell in practice w e re seen to make good PhD students. T h e Horserace Betting Levy Board mentioned that the applicants for its r e s e a r ch scholarships had generally d e veloped their motivation to w a rd re s e a r ch after graduation and one or more years in practice. 2.22. Postgraduate v e t e r i n a r y studies w e re seen as reasonably w e l l - p r ovided, in particular because of the g e n e r ous contribution of the Wellcome T rust. On the other hand we heard about a s h o rtage of funding for postdoctoral posts. For want of such openings new postdoctoral r e s e a r chers had either to find teaching positions, which might not be in their area of r e s e a rch, or take short-term posts as r e s e a r ch assistants. It was re c o g n i z ed that this problem was not peculiar to ve t e r i n a r y science, but veterinarians had the financially a t t r a c t i v e alternative of entering practice and so w e re liable to leave the academic sector after completing doctoral studies. BVA said that veterinarians in university r e s e a rc h we re badly paid compared with those in referral practices, and suggested that the universities create a higher salary scale by analogy with medically-qualified academic staff. 2.23. Lord Soulsby argued that a research pyramid was needed, with: support for undergraduate vacation research and intercalation;CHAPTER T WO 24postgraduate studies, normally for a PhD, which might be supported by the same organizations which funded residency training programmes; postdoctoral posts, perhaps focussed on particular disciplines, which might be funded by the public sector emplo yers of veterinarians and also by industr y and the specialist divisions of the B VA; a small number of ten-year senior postdoctoral posts, with an expectation of tenure thereafter, perhaps endo wed as named posts; and a research chair or chairs, probably funded by several donors (preferably by endowment), awar d e d competitively to a veterinary school. 2.24. Lord Soulsby noted that the creation of such a pyramid would call for co-operation between the ve t e r i n a r y schools and other r e s e a r ch institutions to establish a national approach to research and research training and convince potential donors. COVERAGE OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF RESEARCH 2.25. Our call for evidence invited comments on the strengths and weaknesses of veterinary research in the UK and on existing or foreseen gaps in co verage. The results of the 1996 Research Assessment E xercise, noted in chapter 1 above, identified particularly strong research groups in the veterinary schools working in the following areas: muscle and connective tissue biology; neurology; musculoskeletal pathobiology views put to us in evidence, noted belo w, extended to re s e a r ch in other university departments and in the research Institutes and elsewhere.2.26. There was concern that the common diseases of far m animals needed more attention. Much of the evidence came from bodies concerned with particular sectors. 2.27. The Milk D e velopment Council saw infer t i l i t y, lameness and mastitis as major causes of lost pr o d u c t i v i t y and leading to some w e l f a re concerns in the dairy sector. The Council considered that the current level of r e s e a rch on these conditions did not reflect their importance to the i n d u s t r y. Much of the r e s e a rch commissioned by the Council itself was directed at the applied level and technology transfer, and more fundamental r e s e a rch was also needed. The British Cattle V e t e r i n a r y Association identified mastitis, infer t i l i t y, lameness, metabolic conditions, parturition problems, calf pneumonia and calf diarrhoea as the main priorities for r e s e a rch in cattle disease. 2.28. The British Veterinary Poultry Association, drawing attention to the size and economic importance of the poultry industr y, declared roundly that UK veterinar y research and teaching were failing adequately to support it. The Association noted that research on poultry disease was done in various establishments, but on shor t - t e r m contracts; it also expressed concern o ver the supply of veterinarians with the relevant skills for work on poultr y disease, notably pathology, microbiology and immunology , and o ver the loss of existing expertise when funds wer e diverted in response to changes in priorities. 2.29. The Pig Veterinary Society took an equally sombr e view, suggesting that \"farm animal veterinary research and teaching is probably at the lo west point since 1945\". The Society saw a pressing need for more research on pig respiratory and enteric diseases, and also identified a need for more attention to locomotor disorders, infertility and certain zoonoses. Expertise in pig disease was being lost: between 1984 and 1996 the number of the Society 's members employed in commercial r e s e a r ch, in the Institutes or in the universities had gone down from 47 to 26 and MAFF emplo yed 38 in 1996 as against 78 in 1984. 2.30. On a wider point, a number of respondents adv o c a t e d closer links between v e t e r i n a r y and agricultural r e s e a rch and m o re attention to the control of disease through husbandryCHAPTER T WO 25and pr e ve n t i v e management, in order to reduce reliance on antibiotics, anthelmintics and v a c c i n e s . 2.31. We were told that research at the molecular level was s t rong but with patchy coverage. Professor O n i o n s identified the following areas of particular strength: transgenic animal technology, including r e s e a rch on the d e velopment of nuclear transfer technologies and stem cell technologies for the production of cloned embry o s ; genome mapping of the domestic species; molecular virology and bacteriology, including recombinant vaccine development; the spongiform encephalopathies; molecular parasitology; aspects of neurology and neuropathology; and bone formation and skeletal disorders. 2.32. In its particular field of companion animal studies the Animal Health T rust noted good research in equine v i ro l o g y , molecular biology and vaccine dev e l o p m e n t , canine immunodermatology, genome and ocular studies, and equine sports science. 2.33. A number of submissions drew attention to a s h o rtage of basic knowledge of the diseases of the main ve t e r i n a r y species, including both farm and companion animals. Professor Michell explained the problem in the f o l l owing terms: \"The distinctive difficulty for veterinary research is this: whether in important areas of basic research or the majority of areas of clinical research, the species- specific baseline knowledge is not in place. We hav e to dig foundations as well as erect state-of-the-ar t architecture.... In most areas of veterinary clinical science, certainly for non-infectious disease (in which the problems are more constant, less susceptible to change) we lack the baseline quantitative knowledge, both epidemiological and analytical, which has been commonplace in human medicine for decades.\" 2.34. Others expressed similar views. The British Small Animal Veterinary Association called for research to betargeted so as to supply quantitative knowledge of the problems encountered in practice. Individual submissions commented on an erosion in the capacity to undertake i n t e rd i s c i p l i n a r y field studies of the aetiology and pathogenesis of diseases and a \"desperate\" need for good clinical research to pr ovide reliable data on many of the commonest animal diseases. A practitioner reported that he had originally been drawn to research for lack of the data needed for objective diagnosis and therapy; many areas of clinical ignorance still needed to be remedied. T h e Horserace Betting Levy Board similarly said that knowledge of the horse was less advanced than for other species and that basic studies were often needed before a strategic or applied problem could be addressed. Examples of areas where the Board had identified such a lack of basic studies included the relationship between nutrition and health in the horse and the exploitation of epidemiology . The British Equine Veterinary Association commented that there had been r e m a r kably little application of molecular biology to equine research in the UK. The Animal Health T rust thought that significantly under- re s e a r ched areas included small animal and equine bacteriology, pathogenesis studies and epidemiology . 2.35. Basic r e s e a rch on the v e t e r i n a r y species was seen as i m p o r tant not only for v e t e r i n a r y practice but also for its contribution to c o m p a r a t i v e medicine. Human and ve t e r i n a r y medicine w e re seen as symbiotic, and it was noted that many of the early discoveries of oncogenes resulted fr o m studies of virus-induced cancers in birds and cats. REQUIREMENTS OF CLINICAL RESEARCH 2.36. We received views on how to develop high-quality clinical research. This term was widely used in the evidence without being defined. A simple definition was given b y the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology in appendix 3 of its Report on Medical Research and the NHS Reforms (HL Paper 12, May 1995): in the context of human medicine clinical research was described as that which required access to patients or to well volunteers. In veterinary science \"clinical research \" seems to be used in either or both of two senses:CHAPTER T WO 26 re s e a rch which studies the v e t e r i n a r y species as subjects in their own right (as distinct from using laboratory animals as models for other species); research designed to elucidate the diseases of the veterinary species, for the sake of better prevention, diagnosis and treatment. 2.37. One pr e requisite was the right combination of skills. This was variously described, but with br o a d a g reement on the importance of clinicians with r e s e a rc h training collaborating with laboratory scientists in i n t e rd i s c i p l i n a r y teams. 2.38. Access to clinical material was not generally seen as a problem, though the British Small Animal Veterinar y Association said that there was sometimes a disappointing response from practitioners to requests for case material. A reasonable time-span was seen as necessary in order to obtain enough cases, and it was suggested that important strategic research often needed to be done on a larger scale and o ver a longer period than was possible for a single research fellow on a three-year grant. Short-term project funding for studies of the veterinary species also created a problem for the maintenance of animal facilities and purpose-bred animal stocks. 2.39. The controls applied under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were said to inhibit the use of material (such as blood samples) from general practice for clinical epidemiology; the Home Office took the vie w, however, that the controls were necessary in order to regulate sampling when this was for the purposes of research (rather than for clinical purposes) in accordance with the intentions of the Act. RESEARCH BY CLINICIANS IN THE VETERINARY SCHOOLS 2.40. The evidence we received, and the views put to us during visits, painted a consistent picture of the difficulty faced by clinicians in the veterinary schools in pursuing research. The Wellcome Trust was aware of postgraduate veterinarians who aimed to divide their time between research and clinical teaching or practice, but the T rustdoubted whether they would generally succeed in the competition for grants. Other evidence expressed concern that the young researchers currently being trained on Wellcome T rust studentships and fellowships would hav e difficulty later in returning to clinical work while continuing with research. 2.41. The problem was pr e s s u r e of time. The schools w e re said to be understaffed in the face of rising student numbers and unable to afford proper cover in the full range of clinical specialities. The referral services had become substantial and necessary money-raising enterprises in their own right and made significant demands on the time of clinical staff. As a result it was said that most clinicians in the v e t e r i n a r y schools w e re too busy teaching in small groups, and delivering and s u p e r vising services to patients, to be able to devote time to re s e a rch on a regular basis, or indeed to acquire r e s e a rc h skills and compete for funds. The difficulty was worse when, as was often the case, a clinician was the sole re p re s e n t a t i v e of a speciality within the school. Clinician members of r e s e a rch teams faced a danger of being m a r g i n a l i z ed because of their limited and irregular time- commitment and could find that they did little ex c e p t p roduce clinical specimens. In one visit we w e re told that the clinician was liable to become \"the person who cuts the lumps off \" . 2.42. We are once more indebted to P rofessor Michell for an eloquent statement of the dilemma: \"Ve t e r i n a r y clinical academics cannot simply turn their backs on their clinical responsibilities thr o u g h a p p ropriate timetabling, even if their consciences would allow it. They remain role models and work in a small profession: students are future colleagues and k n ow existing colleagues. If there is a patient in the clinic whose sur v i val may depend on their unique e x p e r tise they cannot simply plead that it is ' t h e i r month on r e s e a rc h '. Of course, colleagues can deputise for many clinical responsibilities but if there a re not 'edge of kno w l e d g e ' problems coming into the clinic and leaders in their field on the staff, how can ve t e r i n a r y schools claim to be centres of ex c e l l e n c e ?\"CHAPTER T WO 272.43. One response was to propose some separation of teaching and research functions, with ring-fenced posts. We were told that the University of Glasgow had decided to allow some staff to opt for full-time teaching and clinical duties, thus enabling others to have time protected for research. Such a solution was not, ho wever, seen as ideal: combining teaching and research was seen as intellectually and educationally preferable, and it was suggested that the clinician was best placed to recognize the problems which might be solved by applying the disco veries of fundamental science. The Animal Health T rust proposed that the assessment regimes to which the schools and Institutes are subject should r eward success in combining teaching and research. 2.44. The heads of the veterinary schools urged the need to remedy what they saw as the structural underfunding of undergraduate veterinary education. Veterinary students, like medical students, had to be taught clinical skills b y being exposed to patients. The medical schools had access without charge to the teaching hospitals and other National Health Service institutions for this purpose, while the veterinary schools had to pr ovide their own clinical services so as to have patients for teaching purposes. Fees were reco vered from the owners of the patients, but the level of fees which could be charged was constrained by the competition of private referral practices. The costs of the referral services pr ovided by the schools were, moreo ver, inevitably higher than those of private practitioners because of the teaching function. It was therefore very difficult for the referral services of the v e t e r i n a r y schools to be financially self-supporting. 2.45. The Wellcome T rust endorsed the analysis of the heads of the v e t e r i n a r y schools and described the v e t e r i n a r y schools as like clinical medical schools denied inv o l vement in the NHS. The T rust argued that the financial gap should be filled by the Government in recognition of the impor t a n c e of ve t e r i n a r y science to the public health and that MAFF should take on a sponsoring role for v e t e r i n a r y medicine within the v e t e r i n a r y schools, including r e s e a rch and training, over and above the support given by the H i g h e r Education Funding Councils. The M i n i s t r y in response took the view that it had no brief to support clinical training.RESEARCH AND GENERAL PRACTICE 2.46. We asked whether there were arrangements for publicizing and exploiting r e s e a r ch carried out by veterinary practitioners. Some excellent research was said to have come from this quarter, and the Animal Health T rust, which has close links with practitioners, spoke of a pressing need to engage them in research in the schools and Institutes so as to take advantage of their wealth of experience and knowledge and pr ovide researchers with better clinical information. The T rust also noted that research by practitioners was regularly published in a number of journals, but emphasized the importance of high standards of peer review and recognized that this could be intimidating. A number of submissions saw scope for young veterinarians to build a hybrid career spanning practice and research, and for the veterinary schools to c u l t i v ate a closer relationship with selected practices (whose facilities and clinical reputations might rival those of their university colleagues) and involve them in both re s e a r ch and teaching. On the other hand, two postgraduate veterinarians who had spent some time in practice reported that they had tried to combine it with research and had met resistance from practice colleagues, who were unsympathetic to part-time working. FUNDING OF RESEARCH 2.47. We asked whether present funding arrangements p rovided adequately for basic, strategic and applied r e s e a rc h . 2.48. T h e re was general agreement that clinical r e s e a rc h accounted for a r e l a t i v ely small share of e x p e n d i t u r e o n ve t e r i n a r y re s e a rch, as compared with fundamental science on the one hand (much, of course, of inestimable value to ve t e r i n a r y species) and near-market clinical trials on the o t h e r . This was not new: Professor W i l d y' s Wo rking P a rt y found that clinical r e s e a rch was less well-funded than pr e - and para-clinical r e s e a rch, being r e l a t i v ely unsuccessful in the competition for R e s e a rch Council grants. The evidence we re c e i ved from the v e t e r i n a r y schools spoke of a funding gap, the difficulty of obtaining funding for studies of v e t e r i n a r y species as subjects in their own right, ov e r - reliance on supportCHAPTER T WO 28f rom charities and little scope for long-term funding of re s e a rch groups. T h e r e was a widespread view that fundamental molecular biology was currently being fav o u re d at the expense of applicable r e s e a rch. The Animal H e a l t h T rust, for example, suggested that clinical r e s e a rch was c h ronically underfunded and grant awards skewed to w a rd the study of molecular mechanisms to the neglect of clinical trials and epidemiological studies of non-infectious disease. 2.49. A number of submissions suggested that even when funds w e re obtained for clinical r e s e a rch the institution tended to derive less benefit than might be expected. T h u s we w e re told that grants from the animal charities w e re n o rmally restricted to non-inv a s i ve studies and did not c over anything like the full overhead costs of the institution. It was also claimed that a track-r e c o rd of carrying out clinical r e s e a rch did not count for much in F u n d i n g Council r e s e a rch assessments, because publications in the clinical and v e t e r i n a r y journals w e re poorly rated and little weight was given to grants from charities and industry when an institution's success in obtaining external r e s e a rc h funding was measured. The Funding Councils disagr e e d and told us that the assessment process was not intended to f a vour any particular kind of r e s e a rch: the object was to m e a s u r e re s e a rch quality through peer r e v i ew. 2.50. Many of the submissions received claimed that BBSRC was increasingly supporting fundamental science using laboratory animals rather than applied research and re s e a rch on the v e t e r i n a r y species. The U n i versity of Edinburgh stressed the need for adequate v e t e r i n a r y representation on the Council 's advisory panels to ensur e that clinical and whole animal research were properly valued and guard against a drift of funds into \"mouse genetics\". B VA among others pointed out that there was no Re s e a r ch Council with a specific remit to support veterinary research; the Association suggested that applied re s e a rch on animal disease was disadvantaged by the inclusion of veterinary research under the broad heading of animal science, and that the subject would more appropriately be sponsored by MRC. 2.51. BBSRC itself told us that it sought to fund all forms of excellent science based on biology and biotechnology .It did not have a remit to support research on particular species, whether they w e re of biological impor t a n c e , companion animals or raised for food. It was ready to fund such work if it was excellent science and an account was g i ven of the r e l e vance of the r e s e a rch. The Council continued to be substantially engaged in large animal science through the relevant Institutes and through grants to other establishments. N ew budgetary arrangements had been adopted in order to allocate funds more flexibly between subjects within its remit, and the Council could consider a special initiative if evidence were produced to show that a particular area of research was underdeveloped. 2.52. The evidence put to us recognized the unique contribution made by the Wellcome Trust in funding veterinary science, notably research training and clinical re s e a rch. The evidence noted the need for adequate veterinary representation on the Trust's advisory panels, particularly in relation to the funding of projects as distinct from the support of individuals. The T rust itself has e x p ressed concern that its support should be complemented by greater funding for veterinary research infrastructure and training from other bodies. 2.53. When visiting the M o redun R e s e a rch Institute we h e a rd that its c o re funding from Scottish Office enabled it to u n d e r take a sustained programme of basic and strategic re s e a rch, giving a foundation for applied studies. The funding regime did not, how e ve r, enable the Institute to r e s p o n d quickly to new opportunities, and it could not obtain grants for this purpose from other major funding bodies. 2.54. We received comments on the particular funding arrangements for equine research. The British Equine Veterinary Association told us that such research had benefited from support by bodies such as the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the Home of Rest for Horses, particularly for clinical research, but had had a minimal contribution from public funds. The Levy Board itself expressed concern that basic and strategic equine research received little support from other bodies apart from the Wellcome T rust, that the equine charities were inhibited from funding invasive research, and that the total funding from the equine grant awarding bodies did not meet theCHAPTER T WO 29need. The Boar d's own funds had in recent years only been enough to support projects which were rated very highly b y independent assessors. 2.55. A number of those who gave evidence saw scope for m o re funding of r e s e a rch by industry, which according to the context might refer to the pharmaceutical companies, the various enterprises engaged in the production and m a rketing of food animals, the horse breeders, or the m a n u f a c t u r ers of food and other products and services for companion animals. BVA r e p o rted that, in their per c e p t i o n , i n d u s t r y was reluctant to invest in r e s e a rch unless the r e s u l t s we re almost ready to be marketed. Others suggested that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies might s u p p o r t pre-patentable clinical r e s e a rch (as distinct fr o m clinical trials of new products), and that industry might i n vest in r e s e a rch in publicly-funded institutions in order to underpin its present and future needs for expertise and facilities. The Pig V e t e r i n a r y Society suggested splitting the costs of pig r e s e a rch three ways, between the producers, the abattoirs or retailers, and the Gov e r n m e n t . FUNDING STRATEGY AND CO-ORDINATION 2.56. We asked whether there w e re satisfactory arrangements for co-ordinating funding policy . 2.57. A number of submissions commented on the lack of a national strategy and the weakness of arrangements for co-ordination of veterinary research. The Animal Health T rust, citing BSE and equine viral arteritis as examples, criticized what it described as a national weakness of responding to short-term crises rather than following a long-term plan. The T rust suggested setting up a permanent body to advise on veterinary research strategy . 2.58. The Horserace Betting Levy Board and British Equine Veterinary Association told us that there wer e arrangements for liaison and exchange of information in the field of equine medicine but not for co-ordination of policy between the different interests, and the Association described equine research as fragmented and lacking in strategy. Other submissions supported the view that mor eco-ordinated arrangements were needed for funding and planning research on a national basis, although there was also some concern to maintain a diverse funding base and avoid o ver-concentration of decisions. MAFF thought t h e re we re already satisfactory arrangements for co- ordinating the activities of the agriculture departments and BBSRC. The British Veterinary Poultry Association saw a need for central co-ordination in order to ensure that specialized expertise was not lost when projects came to an end. The Milk Development Council commented on the complexity of funding systems in England and suggested that the simpler arrangements in Scotland made for better integration and co-ordination of the chain from basic to applied research. 2.59. A different point was made by the Agricultural Economics Unit of the University of E xeter, arguing that strategic and applied veterinary research needed to be justified by the economic value of the reduction in disease or impr ovement in welfare that it was designed to achieve. The Unit called for a greater involvement of economists and epidemiologists in decisions on animal health. COMPETITION ,COLLABORATION AND SPECIALIZATION 2.60. We raised the question how far centres of veterinar y re s e a r ch should specialize rather than compete. T h e responses raised complex and important issues. 2.61. Competition for funding was generally thought to be h e a l t h y , even though it might under some cir c u m s t a n c e s inhibit free exchange of ideas. Some r e g retted that a climate of riv a l ry was promoted by competition for grants and by the emphasis on r e s e a rch funding, rather than outcomes, in assessments of performance; others accepted the value of competition between r e s e a rch institutions but thought it realistic to r e c o g n i z e the special strengths of par t i c u l a r c e n t r es and refrain from duplicating them. The U n i versity of Edinburgh saw specialization growing out of competition, a s institutions sought large grants and created centres of e xcellence, though it was important that small groups should still be able to obtain funds in order to challenge the established fundholders.CHAPTER T WO 302.62. The terms \"centre of excellence\" and \"critical mass \" were regularly used to refer to collaborative groupings of complementary expertise (not necessarily in one place or confined to one institution) big enough to compete for funding, establish a reputation and draw in talent from elsewhere. Specialization through centres of e xcellence was seen as promoting collaboration, with institutions taking advantage of each other 's particular strengths rather than aiming to be self-sufficient. The Animal Health T rust maintained that the small size of the veterinary research community in the UK, or indeed in the European Union, did not permit the luxury of unnecessary duplication, and that projects should increasingly make use of the s p e c i a l i z ed contributions of different bodies. A study might, for instance, draw on basic molecular biology at one centre and animal challenge studies in the target species in another .The T rust thought the funding agencies might reasonably insist on collaboration of this kind. 2.63. Some suggested that the v e t e r i n a r y schools should d e velop clinical specialisms and academic depth in some a reas and drop others, in order to reduce the teaching load on clinicians and so free them for r e s e a rch. The B r i t i s h Small Animal V e t e r i n a r y Association found this idea a t t r a c t i v e but impractical, given the need for all the schools to deliver the complete v e t e r i n a r y curriculum, and the British Equine V e t e r i n a r y Association explored the point in the following terms: \"As far as the v e t e r i n a r y schools are concerned they h a ve to comprise a broad church of clinical and basic science interests in order to teach their undergraduate curriculum. This limits the extent to which they can s p e c i a l i z e and in turn leads to fragmented effort, and competition. The critical problem for schools is that re s e a rch cannot be seen in isolation. It has to be put into the context of undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and clinical service. Thus specialization with the development of 'critical mass', long-term stability and 'well found laboratories' is attractive but not necessarily easily attainable under the current system.\" 2.64. There was an impressive consensus on the need for far closer links between the veterinary schools, the researchInstitutes and other bodies, including non-v e t e r i n a r y university departments and the Veterinary Investigation Centres. P rofessor Wildy's W orking Party reported ten years ago that the v e t e r i n a r y schools w e re not w e l l - equipped to house large animals or contain infectious diseases and thought they could do more to use the facilities and expertise of other establishments. T h e evidence we received indicated that this remained the case. 2.65. The Animal Health T rust urged the Institutes to encourage joint collaborative projects with the veterinar y schools and suggested that undergraduate and postgraduate students in the schools could make a marked contribution to research programmes in the Institutes, for instance during elective studies. The Moredun Research Institute thought it beneficial for its staff to teach undergraduates and was exploring the possibility of joint appointments with the University of Edinburgh. Collaboration with the universities also offered the Institute indirect access to a wide range of funding sources, making possible a rapid response to new research opportunities. 2.66. The veterinary schools for their part were well awar e of the practical advantages they could gain fr o m collaboration with the Institutes and saw themselves as able to offer a particular benefit in return: ready access to a community of scholars, to borr ow a phrase from the submission of the University of Edinburgh. On the same theme we were told that the veterinary school of the University of Bristol was placed within the Faculty of Medicine alongside the medical and dental schools so that the three clinical schools could feed off the same strong School of Medical Sciences, the constituent departments of which also belonged to the Faculty of Science. A view from the pharmaceutical industry was that the schools should not try to reproduce the infrastructure of the Institutes but should exploit interaction with their medical and biological science departments in order to create leading edge services for the Institutes to draw on. 2.67. A number of submissions advocated a c l o s e r relationship between the veterinary schools and the research and diagnostic facilities of MAFF and the other agricultur e Departments (and SA C Veterinary Services).CHAPTER T WO 312.68. T h e r e we re proposals for s t ructural changes i n o rder to promote collaboration. Professor W i l d y's re p o rt f a vo u r ed bringing together the v e t e r i n a r y laboratories of the State V e t e r i n a r y Se rvice and the r e s e a r ch In s t i t u t e s under common management and associating them with the universities, and in particular the v e t e r i n a r y schools w h e r e possible. At least two of the r e o r g a n i ze d laboratories w e re to be co-located with v e t e r i n a r y schools and work with them, making joint applications for re s e a rch funds and involving laboratory staff in teaching the univ e r s i t y 's postgraduate students. In evidence to us some of the Heads of the v e t e r i n a r y schools pr o p o s e d similarly that the long-term aim should be to gr o u p ve t e r i n a r y re s e a rch (and ideally surveillance) facilities round the schools, these being seen as the natural centr e s because they w e re the only bodies which cov e red the s p e c t r um from patient care to basic r e s e a r ch. S o m e submissions commended the benefits for teaching and re s e a rch of locating r e s e a r ch units within univ e r s i t y clinical schools and suggested that the R e s e a r ch Councils might make it their policy to support new centres of e xcellence in strategic areas (such as animal w e l f a re , n e u ro p a t h o l o g y , genetic disorders and epidemiology) in the v e t e r i n a r y schools. COMPARISON WITH AMERICAN EXPERIENCE 2.69. Our concern was with veterinary research in the UK, but we benefited from a discussion with Dr J o h n Shadduck, the former Dean of the College of Veterinar y Medicine of Texas A & M University who studied aspects of veterinary education in Britain as an Administrativ e Fulbright Fellow in 1994. 2.70. A number of the American veterinary colleges hav e the advantage of operating on a larger scale than the British veterinary schools, employing 10 0 -150 staff . In Dr Shadduck 's experience a veterinary College with a large faculty had more flexibility to reser ve staff time for research and to build links with other parts of the parent university. Nevertheless, in Dr Shadduck 's view many of the issues raised in the evidence we received arose also in the United States.2.71. Dr Shadduck reported concerns in the US that too f ew veterinarians took up careers in r e s e a r ch. O n e contributory factor, in America as in Britain, was the selection of veterinary students (by themselves and by the colleges) on the basis of motivation toward practice and the subsequent reinforcement of that bias by clinical teachers in the colleges. In Dr Shadduck 's view the best way to interest veterinary students in research was to link it in their minds with clinical application and show them researchers and clinicians working side-by-side. 2.72. Dr Shadduck reported that veterinary researchers in the United States complained, as in Britain, that they had to compete for mainstream funding with medical researchers and biologists, and there was similar difficulty in financing work on animal health for its own sake rather than in the context of comparative medicine or for agricultural or pharmaceutical purposes. There were major gaps in knowledge of the diseases of the veterinary species. 2.73. We heard from Dr Shadduck that v e t e r i n a r y Colleges in the US did not have the same financial incentives as the British veterinary schools to carry out pure research. The States supported veterinary education and applied research for the benefit of agriculture, and the internal allocation of resources by the universities was in general not explicitly linked to research performance. By contrast there was a strong expectation, reinforced b y the specialty colleges, of excellence within the various clinical disciplines, and this pulled against the integration of veterinarians into the wider academic community . 2.74. Dr Shadduck advised that the difficulties experienced by the British veterinary schools in funding their clinical services were not unique. Clinical services provided as an adjunct to teaching inevitably lost money , because an academic clinician who treated patients while i n s t ructing students could not hope to match the throughput of a practitioner whose sole concern was to deal with each patient as rapidly and efficiently as possible. As a result clinical teachers in American colleges tended to be under pressure, as in Britain, and the colleges had to be resourceful in finding new ways to finance themselves. Dr Shadduck 's impression was that veterinarians in the USCHAPTER T WO 32tended to be less entrepreneurial than in the UK, for instance in exploiting their intellectual property through consultancy, but were better at working with the private sector (both practitioners and pharmaceutical companies). 2.75. Dr Shadduck considered that there was scope for g reater co-operation between the different American ve t e r i n a r y colleges and between them and the medical schools, the obstacles being human rather than geographical. COMPARISON WITH HUMAN ACADEMIC MEDICINE AND DENTISTR Y 2.76. We were fortunate in being able to refer to the report, \"Clinical Academic Careers\", of the Task Force chaired b y Sir Rex Richards at the invitation of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. The findings of the Task Force, published on 1 July, show that some of the major issues which came to light in the evidence we received ar e also important in human medicine and dentistr y. 2.77. The Task F o rce was asked to r e p o rt on the recruitment and retention of clinical academic staff in UK u n i versities. Its starting point was the pr o p o s i t i o n (paragraph 2.1 of the report) that it is \"self-evident that every effort must be made to continue to attract some of our most able and inno vative young doctors and dentists into the academic branch of the profession. They ar e required to maintain the thriving academic and research base which contributes much to undergraduate teaching and to postgraduate training and continuing education, as well as to acquiring new knowledge of disease processes and impr oving the quality of patient care.\" 2.78. The r e p o rt adduces the following grounds for concern: the performance, described by the Task Force as disappointing, of many of the medical and dental schools in the 1996 Research Assessment E xercise; difficulties reported by the Deans of the schools in filling academic posts at lecturer grade and abo ve; the experience reported in evidence to the Task Force that the time which academic clinicians were meantto devote to research was commonly eroded by the pressures of service, teaching and administration. On this last point, the T ask F o rce comments: \" T h e division of effort between r e s e a r ch, scholarship and teaching is, of course, faced by all academics, whatever the subject; but the addition of direct patient care, to which most clinical academics attach great importance, pr e s e n t s this issue in a particularly acute form\". This is of course the same point as that made to us in relation to v e t e r i n a r y medicine by Professor Michell (quoted in paragraph 2.42 a b ove) and others. 2.79. The Task F o rce observes that if academic clinicians a re, at the v e ry best, spending less than half their time on re s e a r ch this helps to explain why so many medical schools w e re rated 3 or 4 in the R e s e a r ch Assessment Exe rcise, where their r e s e a r ch output was compared with that of r e s e a r ch clinicians in other parts of the world who spend much more of their year on r e s e a r ch. T h e postgraduate medical institutes all achieved R e s e a rc h Assessment Ex e rcise ratings of 5 or 5*in at least one of the t h ree re l e vant units of assessment, and the r e p o rt attributes this in large part to the establishment of major re s e a r ch teams in the institutes, many of them i n t e rd i s c i p l i n a r y, and the r e l a t i v ely modest ser v i c e commitment of the clinical members of these teams. T h e Task F o rce urges the medical and dental schools to r e v i ew the deployment of their staff so as to ensure that the most p romising r e s e a r ch talents have proper time and facilities while other staff less active in r e s e a r ch take on extra teaching and service r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s . 2.80. The report notes with concern that some of the smaller medical and dental schools, while seeking to co ver a full range of specialties, cannot staff some departments (such as anaesthetics and radiology) in sufficient depth for them to be able to sustain a significant r e s e a rc h programme. The Task Force rejects the view that some specialties might be taught by clinical staff not involved in re s e a r ch and recommends collaborative teaching arrangements in order to avoid very small departments: \"By collaboration, there is a chance that each school canCHAPTER T WO 33develop a world class department in one of these minority disciplines, rather than each having a mediocre department in both\". The report also suggests that alliances between departments within a medical or dental school may yield better research results. 2.81. The Task F o rce draws special attention to the difficulty experienced by clinical academic staff in the dental hospitals in preserving time for research in the face of the demands of teaching and service, for two reasons which are particularly relevant to the veterinary schools. 2.82. The first reason concerns the different ways in which medical and dental care are delivered. The Task Force points out that in human medicine the service is divided fairly equally between primary care in the community and the hospitals. The NHS hospitals employ substantial numbers of clinicians, while academic doctors, whose p r i m a r y responsibilities are teaching and r e s e a rc h , represent only a tenth of their clinical staff. By contrast, \"d e n t i s t r y is ov e rwhelmingly a community based s e rvice with dental hospitals existing largely as teaching and r e s e a r ch centres where it is also expedient to offer specialist services. It follows from this that most of the clinical staff in dental hospitals, certainly at senior level, are academics concerned with teaching and research as well as the service that is intimately involved with teaching.\" The position in v e t e r i n a r y medicine seems to be similar. The bulk of v e t e r i n a r y patient care is deliv e red by general practitioners, clinical services are provided by the v e t e r i n a r yschools mainly as an adjunct to teaching and r e s e a rch, and the staff responsible for those services are academics whose main focus should be on teaching and r e s e a rc h . 2.83. The second factor to which the Task F o rce draws attention is that the dental schools are r e q u i r ed to deliv e r graduates who are competent to enter practice without f u rther preparation, there being no equivalent of the medical pr e - registration y e a r. Dental students must t h e re f o r e spend a large part of their clinical years learning to treat patients, under close supervision, and the academic clinicians who r e p resent most of the staff of the dental schools must spend much of their time pro v i d i n g that supervision. Again there is a clear parallel with the ve t e r i n a r y schools, where the academic staff of the clinical departments are heavily engaged in teaching students in small groups in order to pr e p a re them to be practising veterinarians. T h e r e is a tension between the d i f f e r ent roles of a university department and a vocational training college. 2.84. The Task Force concludes that \"dental specialties ar e very similar to the smallest medical specialties: they shar e the problems of small numbers of academic staff with little flexibility, great service and teaching pressures, and often poor research funding and infrastructure and, in any case, little time to pursue serious research. As a result, many able members of staff find it difficult to fulfil the requirements of their universities that will gain them promotion.\" The report does not offer a solution but recommends a revie w of the funding of dental schools and hospitals and an enquiry into the long-term arrangements, structure and objectives of dental education and training.CHAPTER T WO 34CHAPTER 3:THE COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS INTRODUCTION 3.1. In this chapter we give our own assessment of the main issues which were raised in evidence to us and offer recommendations. B e f o re dealing, how e ve r, with the various questions which have been identified in relation to re s e a r ch into animal health and w e l f a re, and the engagement of the veterinary profession in that research, we should say why we believe that the subject matters. 3.2. Historically, veterinary research has been supported b y the State for the benefit of agriculture and public health, because of the national interest in having healthy farm animals and wholesome food. Research has been focussed on the infectious diseases, both endemic and exotic, of production animals and on the pathogens which pass from animals to people through the food chain. Recent events - not only the BSE epidemic and the transmission of Escherichia coli 0157 in food but also the current outbreak of classical swine fever on the continent - show that these traditional concerns remain valid. Pathogens evolve, and an infectious disease cannot be written off simply because an effective vaccine or drug therapy seems to have been found. In human medicine the resurgence of tuberculosis and the failure to control malaria are sobering demonstrations of the resourcefulness of the micro-organisms which cause disease. A wider range of measures can be used to deal with animal disease, including the culling of affected populations and breeding for resistance, but such measures can carry heavy costs. 3.3. The reasons which lay behind the post-war research programmes on the diseases of farm animals thus remain as valid as ever. In recent years, ho wever, new concerns hav e emerged as well. Dairy farming and the breeding of pigs and poultry have become very much more productive, but changed methods and r e s e a rch developments (e.g. in genetics) call for new research to identify and help resolv e new problems. There is gr owing public sensitivity to the welfare of farm animals, and that concern needs to be backed by science in order to establish as objectively aspossible the effects of different production systems on the well-being of the animals. 3.4. There is a further factor. Research into companion animal medicine has not enjoyed the same financial support as work on production animals, yet pet animals ar e the main business of many veterinary practices and the owners of the animals expect ever higher standards of t reatment. Practitioners are responding with gro w i n g specialization and better equipment, but the knowledge- base lags behind. The demand for more advanced care for companion animals implies a demand for a higher level of fundamental research on the anatomy and physiology of the veterinary species and more clinical research into their diseases and disorders. 3.5. We now mo ve on to consider, first, the subject of veterinarians in research and then issues on research into animal health and welfare. THE NEED FOR VETERINARIANS IN RESEARCH 3.6. It is generally agreed that research into animal health benefits from the inv o l vement of v e t e r i n a r i a n s , collaborating with biological scientists. This is partly for the practical reason that their experience gives veterinarians a particular understanding of the lives of production animals and the impact of breeding, environment and nutrition on their health. This is particularly relevant in view of current concerns o ver the safety of food of animal origin, since the control of dangerous pathogens needs to start with the live animal. But there is a more fundamental point. Veterinarians are trained to look at the working of the whole animal and so can make the connection between the advances in the various biological specialisms and the health and welfare of animals. Following decades in which the biomedical sciences have made spectacular progress b y u n r a v elling mechanisms at the level of the cell, the emphasis is increasingly on the translation of basic research into clinical practice. In veterinary science much basic work remains to be done, and the research portfolios of the veterinary schools and the research Institutes still show a marked concentration on cellular processes and pathogens,CHAPTER T H R E E 35often with wholly in vitr osystems. In future, ho wever, there will be a gr owing need to use the results of basic veterinary research to gain a better understanding of animal function in health and disease, and veterinary graduates will have a special part to play in this. 3.7. It would be hard to say just how many veterinar y graduates need to be recruited each year into full- or part- time research careers, but some indications can be given on the basis of the numbers currently emplo yed in different sectors. The RCVS annual report shows 1 1115 registered veterinarians currently in employment in the UK. Fiv e sixths of these - 9264 - are in full-time general practice and the remainder - 1851 - are in G overnment service, higher education, Research Council Institutes, charities, industr y and commerce. The detailed breakdown of the locations of the 1851 emplo yed outside practice indicates that about 1000 are likely to be active in research. 3.8. This simple comparison between employment sectors suggests that, if the veterinary schools are delivering the right number of graduates each year to meet future needs and the present distribution of the profession is to be maintained, about a sixth of the new veterinarians should take up long-term careers other than practice and of these about a half should take up careers where research is a significant commitment. Last year the British veterinar y schools produced 396 graduates, so some 6 0-70 of these might be expected to pursue careers other than practice, and of these perhaps 3 0-35 might become active in research. These figures do not take account of likely changes (whether desirable or not) in the numbers emplo yed in the different sectors or of the mo vement of veterinarians into and out of the UK, so they should not be taken literally .They do, ho wever, help to demonstrate that veterinarians active in research are a significant minority whose numbers need at least to be replenished by young veterinary graduates leaving the schools. 3.9. Veterinarians employed in r e s e a rch are of course not a homogeneous commodity but need different skills for d i f f e r ent purposes. The public sector and industrial e m p l o yers of v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rchers told us that they had difficulty in finding v e t e r i n a r y graduates who have bothre s e a rch training and expertise in particular disciplines such as pathology, micr o b i o l o g y , epidemiology and immunology. UNDERGRADU ATE EDUC ATION 3.10. Our terms of r e f e rence do not mention undergraduate education, but the evidence we received (both formally and in discussions during visits) made it impossible to ignore its impact on the well-being of ve t e r i n a r y re s e a rch. The issues identified concern the selection of veterinary students, their exposure to research as undergraduates, and the demands which the curriculum makes on the academic staff of the veterinary schools. 3.11. Most of the young people who go to the veterinar y schools intend to enter practice, and that is where most of the demand for veterinary graduates lies. The figures quoted abo ve sho w, however, that veterinarians are also needed in significant numbers by emplo yers in other areas, not least the veterinary schools themselves. Students should therefore be selected and educated with an eye to the needs of all the main areas of employment, including research. The numbers discussed abo ve suggest that, in selecting ne w entrants and determining course contents, the schools should see one in ev e ry dozen students as a future researcher . 3.12. In fact we were told that the large majority of veterinary students are fixed on the idea of entering practice before they even go to veterinary school. That may be partly the result of self-selection, but we understand also that the universities, having to choose between large numbers of highly-qualified school-leavers, look for those with a clear bent toward working with animals. Clearly it is right for the veterinary schools to have in mind the recruitment needs of practice, but there should also be a place for young people who wish to use a veterinary degree as the foundation for a different career. It may, for instance, be possible partly to substitute work experience in a laboratory for that with a farm or veterinary practice. We were concerned also that the veterinary schools did not seem to acknowledge ownership of their selection practices. We were told that the RCVS constrained the selectionCHAPTER T H R E E CHAPTER T H R E E 36criteria adopted by the schools, but the R oyal College itself denied doing so .The schools need to be clear where the responsibility lies, but it would also be helpful if they and the RCVS could reach a common view of the selection policies which are appropriate. 3.13. Once admitted to a veterinary course, students need to receive an education which gives them a grasp of the importance of research, no matter which branch of the profession they may go into later. Research, not opinion, underpins veterinary practice (as it does in all professions). The science which veterinarians learn as undergraduates is based on past and recent research, and the science they apply during the course of their working lives will undergo major changes as a result of research in progress now and in the future. It is therefore important for veterinary graduates who enter practice, or go vernment service or industr y, to know how research is done and how the results are used, even if they themselves do not carry out research. As to the minority of veterinary undergraduates who will take up research as a career, they need to have their interest aroused and get a feel for what it is like to work in a laboratory and test hypotheses. 3.14. These propositions were widely accepted by those who put views to us, and there was general support for the value of intercalated science degrees, research-based electiv e studies, teaching links between veterinar y, biological and medical departments, and research experience in vacations. This is where the focus for research-based teaching must lie within the existing course str u c t u r e. The evidence nevertheless suggests that in reality undergraduate courses are dominated by training for practice and include ver y little exposure to research or preparation for a research c a re e r . We w e re sorry to hear from a number of undergraduates that their teachers tended to fr own on any d i versions from training for practice. The v e t e r i n a r y profession claims to be science-led and needs to convey that message to new entrants during their formative years. 3.15. For this purpose it is a complication that a substantial p a rt of the animal health r e s e a rch infrastr u c t u r e lies outside the v e t e r i n a r y schools, in the r e s e a rch Institutes and the MAFF laboratories. It would serve little purpose if we w e reto debate the advantages and disadvantages of the historic separation between the universities and the state r e s e a rc h establishments, but the resulting div o rce between education and an important part of the r e s e a rch base can only be re g retted. The v e t e r i n a r y schools must of course maintain their own r e s e a rch programmes, both in laborator y - b a s e d and in clinical disciplines, but it would also be valuable if undergraduates could share in the excitement of studies using the specialized facilities and expertise of the I n s t i t u t e s to elucidate, in par t i c u l a r , the infectious diseases of p roduction animals. It is no surprise that the state-funded sector should find it difficult to r e c ruit young v e t e r i n a r i a n s if their education largely ignores its existence, and ev e n those v e t e r i n a r y graduates who enter practice need to be a w a re of the v e ry important work being done in the Institutes and the Government laboratories. 3.16. The evidence from all sides favoured involving the state-funded Institutes and laboratories in undergraduate education b y, for instance, placing students in the Institutes for vacation and elective studies and setting up teaching links and joint appointments. Such co-operation happens already to some extent. For the most part, ho wever, w e have the impression that it is seen as desirable in theory but not something which anyone is responsible for bringing about. The physical separation between the veterinar y schools and most of the r e s e a r ch establishments is admittedly an obstacle, but this could be o vercome if educational co-operation between them were built into the system rather than treated as an optional extra. The universities should regard the free-standing institutions as part of the research world to which their students must be exposed, while those engaged in research outside the higher education sector should see it as part of their remit to engage in teaching and examining so as to help develop the next generation of scientists. 3.17. A further issue concerns the r e q u i r ement to deliv e r graduates who are competent to practise without fur t h e r training. F i ve years is a short period in which to gain a br o a d k n owledge of v e t e r i n a r y science together with the applied skills of v e t e r i n a r y medicine and surgery, and it is not surprising that the curriculum is overloaded. In chapter 2 we quoted the r e m a r ks of the T ask F o rce on ClinicalCHAPTER T H R E E 37Academic Careers on the pr e s s u res which the dental schools face as a result of the similar r e q u i r ement on them to p roduce graduates who are competent to practise. We are a w a re that this issue has been considered in the past, notably by Dr L u c k e's Wo rking P a rty on V e t e r i n a r y Un d e r g r a d u a t e Education, and that it would not be a straightfor w a rd matter to change the present rules on the registration of ve t e r i n a r y practitioners. We believe, how e ve r, that the RCVS needs to look at this question again, because the ve t e r i n a r y schools cannot realistically aim to deliv e r graduates who have not only had a rounded scientific education but can also treat animals without supervision. So long as the schools are under pr e s s u re to achieve this impossible task they cannot hope also to give students a p roper awareness of r e s e a rch, and the burden which is placed on clinical teaching staff makes it par t i c u l a r l y difficult for them to make a full contribution to r e s e a rc h . 3.18. It will not be possible to assess the likely impact of the report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education chaired by Sir Ron Dearing until the Government has made decisions on the recommendations. If, however, the result is that veterinary students carry a larger share of the costs of their undergraduate education, this will discourage them from extending a course which is already long by taking intercalated science degrees. It will also create an incentive to enter well-paid employment immediately after graduation. For both these reasons the recruitment of veterinary graduates into research could be jeopardized, and compensating mechanisms would need to be considered. 3.19. Werecommend that the veterinary schools should take steps to expose undergraduates to research and research role-models, b y encouraging and facilitating intercalated science studies so far as the cost constraints allow; by exposing students to re s e a rch within the universities and r e s e a rc h institutions through elective and vacation studies; and by developing stronger teaching links with university biological and medical departments and the state funded Institutes and laboratories, for instance through shared posts; that the v e t e r i n a r y schools should review their u n d e r g r aduate selection practices to ensure that potential students with an inclination to an academic and research career are included. The schools should seek the support of the RCVS for this change of emphasis; that the RCVS should review the requirement on the schools to produce veterinary graduates competent to practise without further training. CAREERS IN RESEARCH FOR VETERINARY GRADU ATES 3.20. A good deal of the evidence we received about the difficulties facing young r e s e a r chers with v e t e r i n a r y qualifications identified problems common to other areas of academic science. S h o rt-term contracts, teaching pressures in academic posts and the difficulty of mapping out a long-term career plan are not exclusive to veterinarian re s e a rchers but reflect wider issues. It was suggested, indeed, that veterinarians entering research careers are in some ways more fortunate than scientists in other disciplines as a result of the generosity of the Wellcome T rust and other sponsors of training posts, and BBSR C mentioned that its studentships for veterinarians carr y stipends designed to recognize the competing financial attractions of practice. 3.21. We would not think it appropriate to recommend favoured treatment for veterinary researchers. The evidence suggests nev e rtheless that there is a real problem of promising young people being lost to research at the postdoctoral stage. The picture is not entirely clear, because veterinary graduates studying for doctorates may have no intention of going on to research careers. They may plan to pursue one of the clinical specialisms and enter referral practice. We also heard, ho wever, of young veterinarians obtaining a PhD as the first step toward a research career but then abandoning that aim for want of suitable postdoctoral posts. 3.22. T h e r e are a limited number of employers of veterinarians with research training, and few jobs are likely to be advertised at one time. In consequence the market may need a degree of management to ensure that it meets38the needs of the emplo yers. I f, for example, none of them happens to advertise a first postdoctoral post in one year , that year 's crop of veterinary PhDs may be lost. The hierarchy of schemes pr ovided by the Wellcome T rust p rovides invaluable opportunities for orderly car e e r progression, but the T rust cannot be expected to meet the need alone. The G overnment and the veterinary schools as the major emplo yers of veterinarians in research should therefore assess their requirements and consider making specific arrangements to meet these needs. 3.23. The v e t e r i n a r y schools may see a particular pr o b l e m in growing successors for their present senior staff, giv e n that staffing at junior level is largely dependent on shor t - term funding and promising young people are liable to disappear when the current grant runs out. One answer is to offer a short-term contract with external funding but with a guarantee of longer-term employment when the initial contract has run its course. We noted earlier that MAFF has a specific need for veterinarians with both re s e a r ch and disciplinary training. The M i n i s t r y should t h e re f o r e consider supporting training posts in a p p ropriate institutions. 3.24. The Government and the schools could with advantage pool their assessments of their requirements for ve t e r i n a r y re c ruitment and consider jointly whether current research training pr ovision is enough to ensure an adequate supply of mature researchers. We do not suggest formal manpower planning arrangements, but the emplo yers acting separately are in danger of adopting mutually contradictory policies. They might, for instance, all decide to rely on recruiting experienced people in mid- career while assuming that someone else will pr ovide the necessary experience. If the major emplo yers in the state and academic sectors come together to consider training and career development for veterinary researchers they should bear in mind the needs of the other emplo yers. 3.25. We recommend that the major employers of veterinarians in research should: assess their veterinary recruitment needs and measures to meet them;take stock collectively of current pr ovision for veterinar y re s e a rch training and career development, taking account of the needs of the other employers of veterinarians in research. COVERAGE OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF RESEARCH 3.26. Many of those who put evidence to us had strongly- felt concerns about the balance of effort in current research into animal health. There are two main points, which overlap. It is said, first, that G overnment research spending g i ves lower priority than formerly to work on the economically important endemic diseases of farm animals. Secondly, we were told that it is difficult to obtain funds for clinical research into the veterinary species because the main funding agencies favour leading-edge science using laboratory animals and the animal welfare charities will not fund invasive research. 3.27. T h e r e was little dispute with either of these propositions. MAFF's priorities have been revised in recent years in favour of work on the animal diseases most important for public health. BBSRC and the Wellcome T rust, considered as funders of research as distinct from research training, made clear to us that they are chiefly concerned to promote science which measures up to international standards of excellence, and it is sometimes more sensible to work with rodents or other laborator y species where knowledge is more complete than with dogs or cattle. BBSRC is also concerned to support economically important research for the benefit of industr y and still funds some areas of work with large animals in its s p o n s o r ed Institutes and else w h e r e, but it has giv e n relatively low priority in recent years to strategic work on farm animal health and w e l f a re. The animal w e l f a re societies for their part are an important source of funds for veterinary research but they must respect the views of their donors when deciding what activities to support. 3.28. Plurality of funding is a feature of r e s e a rch in this c o u n t r y . Various bodies finance it, following their o w n policies and priorities, and in animal health there is no one body with the task of ensuring that the r e s e a rch pr o g r a m m e sCHAPTER T H R E E 39of the different institutions add up to a coherent whole. T h e d i f f e r ent grant-awarding bodies judge r e s e a rch pr o p o s a l s against their own criteria and take such initiatives as they think fit, and it would serve little purpose if the Committee we re to urge them to change their policies and give more priority to one area and less to another. R e s e a rchers must take the funding bodies as they find them and be cr e a t i ve in finding ways to tap existing and new sources of finance. 3.29. We are nev e rtheless concerned that r e s e a rch into the ve t e r i n a r y species tends to be undervalued. V e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch must of course be good science. Some v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch has been at the leading edge of science in the past and some will be in the future. W o rthwhile v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rc h will not, how e ve r, always be at the leading edge because much of the physiology and pathology of the v e t e r i n a r y species differs from that of rodents and man and greater kno w l e d g e is needed. R e s e a rch in this area can and should be good science but it should not be criticized because it is not on a par with leading edge r e s e a rch in rodent or in vitro m o d e l systems. R e s e a rch is needed to increase knowledge of species of ve t e r i n a r y importance, and applications for funds to s u p p o r t ve t e r i n a r y re s e a rch should be judged on r e l e vance to the needs of v e t e r i n a r y science as well as the quality of the science. F a i l u re to support v e t e r i n a r y re s e a rch in the target species inevitably leads to such r e s e a rch falling so far behind that it becomes unfundable. 3.30. We noted in the second chapter the suggestions in the evidence we r e c e i ved for new sources of funding, notably f rom the sectors of industry which benefit from v e t e r i n a r y science. The control of disease is, for example, of major c o m m e r cial importance to pig producers, and it is open to re s e a rch providers to try to persuade them collectively to sponsor r e s e a r ch. Realism is nev e rtheless needed. C o m m e r cial organizations will only contribute to r e s e a rc h on a significant scale if they are satisfied that it will help to meet their specific needs and yield an identifiable return in the foreseeable future. I n d u s t r y is not a promising source of s u p p o r t for basic, curiosity-driven r e s e a rch, the benefits of which are inevitably hard to pr e d i c t . 3.31. There is, ho wever, another possible source of ne w funding. The BBSR C 's Corporate Plan confirms theCouncil 's intention to keep under review its funding of the s p o n s o r ed Institutes and to discontinue the pr e s e n t funding of the interdisciplinary research centres as they come to the end of their expected ten-year lifetime. Ther e will be no shortage of proposals for recycling any BBSR C resources which are released as a result, but veterinar y scientists should ensure that their voice is heard. BBSR C has commented on the low level of applications from the veterinary schools for its standard PhD studentships and told us that it accepts in principle that pump-priming finance can be justifiable for a developing area of science. Those who wish to carry out basic r e s e a r ch in the veterinary species should jointly take up the challenge and come together to demonstrate to the funding bodies the need for a special programme to bring it to the point wher e it can compete with other claims on the Research Council 's funds. The climate of public opinion is favourable, given current concerns o ver food safety, gr owing sensitivity o ver animal welfare and the potential of comparative medicine. 3.32. Werecommend that funding bodies considering applications for grants in veterinary science judge them not only on the quality of science but also on the needs for understanding, prevention and treatment of disease in the target species. The need to integrate knowledge at a cellular and genetic level with whole animal function in the target species should be recognized; those engaged in research in the veterinary species should jointly make a case to BBSRC and other funding bodies for a special funding programme. CLINICAL RESEARCH 3.33. Under this heading we look at the special issues which arise in relation to clinical research, with particular reference to such research when carried out by academic clinicians in the veterinary schools. 3.34. The evidence suggests that even in ideal circumstances there would be some difficulty in bringing the necessary mix of skills and experience to bear onCHAPTER T H R E E 40clinical research. Collaboration between clinicians and laboratory scientists will normally be needed, each must have a good understanding of the other 's perspective, and clinicians in academic posts are always liable to be pulled between research, teaching and service. The problems ar e well-known, and they are not peculiar to veterinary science. Sir Rex Richards ' Task Force on clinical academic careers in human medicine and dentistry identified the same problem of research being edged out by service, teaching and administration. 3.35. A number of those who put views to us noted, without enthusiasm, the option of separating research from teaching and service to some extent, allowing a minority of clinical academic staff to concentrate on teaching and service so as to release others for research. This was not seen as ideal, and it runs counter to the expectations of the higher education research assessment process. We think it worth drawing attention also to the educational objection to segregating teaching and research. No doubt it would be unrealistic to expect veterinary undergraduates to be taught only by staff who are actively engaged in research, but it would be most unhealthy if academic veterinarians wer e divided into separate camps for those who teach veterinar y science and those who seek to advance it. 3.36. We note in this connection that those who gav e evidence to the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education chaired by Sir Ron Dearing almost without exception rejected the idea of \"teaching only \" institutions of higher education, most taking the view that such institutions would not be universities in any legitimate sense. The National Committee pr o p o s e d instead that those higher education institutions that wer e focussed mainly on teaching and could not realistically expect to be rated higher than 3b in research assessment exercises should be able to obtain, without competition, modest funding to support the level of research by their staff which was necessary to complement good teaching. The veterinary schools clearly do not fall within this category of institution, but the National Committee 's view of the importance of research to \"inform and enhance \" teaching is in line with the views which were put to us, and with our own views.3.37. Clinical veterinary scientists, like clinical medical and dental scientists, can only conduct high quality research if robust measures are enforced to protect the time allocated to research. Where the research environment is supportiv e British veterinary research can compete with the best in the world. At present the veterinary schools are not able consistently to pr ovide a supportive research environment which pr ovides substantial release time for clinical staff . 3.38. This is partly because, like all university departments, the v e t e r i n a r y schools have had to accommodate an expanded student population and expanding curriculum within ever tighter budgets. The evidence suggests, however, that the clinical teachers in the veterinary schools face a special problem because of the peculiar pressures on the clinical departments. On the one hand we were told that, for lack of a National Health Service for animals, the clinicians in the schools have to run the referral services as self-financing businesses. On the other hand we heard that those services can only charge similar fees to private referral practices and necessarily incur higher costs, because of their teaching function. If clinical teachers are devoting long hours to their students and patients in order to make inherently loss-making services break even it would be surprising if they could engage in sustained research as well. 3.39. This situation is not unique to v e t e r i n a r y medicine. The r e p o rt of Sir Rex Richar d s' Task F o rce describes the p redicament of clinical teachers in the dental schools in terms which could be applied with v e ry little modification to the v e t e r i n a r y schools. The problem seems to be the same, in that in both the v e t e r i n a r y and the dental schools clinical services are provided primarily as an adjunct to teaching, in order to train students for practice, but the clinical academic staff then find that their time is pr e - empted by the demands of service and small-group or individual teaching. 3.40. The financial predicament of the clinical departments in the veterinary schools is of particular concern to us because of its effects on research. Plainly, it is an unhealthy situation if the leading academic practitioners of v e t e r i n a r y clinical medicine are pr e vented fr o m contributing to research. The clinical teachers who instructCHAPTER T H R E E 41veterinary undergraduates in small groups are, moreo ver, bound to influence strongly their conception of the role of the veterinary professional, and it is damaging if research does not form part of the picture. For both these reasons the funding of veterinary clinical education can prejudice clinical r e s e a r ch and the r e c ruitment of v e t e r i n a r y graduates into research careers. Unless a new funding stream is put in place, or the excess costs of the clinical services are borne in some other way, the veterinary schools will face ever greater difficulty in affording the time to conduct research of the required standard. We consider below what form a solution might take. FUNDING OF THE VETERINARY SCHOOLS 3.41. A contrast has often been drawn between the arrangements for veterinary and human medical education. The medical schools, like the veterinary schools, need access to patients and clinical facilities in order to teach students the skills of their future profession. The medical schools, ho wever, traditionally have access, free of charge, to the teaching hospitals of the National Health Service for this purpose. The academic staff of the medical schools use the patients and facilities of the teaching hospital to teach their students and as a base for research, and the NHS does not bill the university for the extra costs which the hospital incurs as a result. Those extra costs have been recognized since the 1970s, when those health authorities which had teaching hospitals began to receive extra allocations in compensation - in England now known as SIFTR, the Service Increment for Teaching and Research. SIFTR and its counterparts are not, ho wever, the concern of the university medical schools. They receive a free benefit from the teaching hospitals and are not directly affected by the arrangements under which the costs are co vered within the Health Service. 3.42. We have noted above that the v e t e r i n a r y schools incur costs similar to those which arise in the NHS teaching hospitals. T h e r e must, indeed, be a special emphasis on clinical teaching in the v e t e r i n a r y schools because of the r e q u i r ement, which we have suggested should be r e v i ewed, to produce graduates who are r e a d yfor practice. The v e t e r i n a r y schools themselves pro v i d e clinical services as a base for teaching, and so function like a medical school and teaching hospital rolled into one. The clinical services of the v e t e r i n a r y schools cannot charge higher fees than the larger specialist r e f e r r a l practices, yet they incur extra costs by reason of their teaching function and so are bound to lose money. It has t h e re f o r e been suggested that the Government should p rovide special financial support for the v e t e r i n a r y schools, in lieu of the benefit in kind which the medical schools r e c e i v e from the teaching hospitals. 3.43. In considering that suggestion it has to be borne in mind that the National Health S e rvice is the main b e n e f i c i a r y of the product of the medical schools, the majority of whose graduates work within the NHS. T h a t , no doubt, is why the NHS does not seek to r e c over the extra costs of the teaching hospitals from the medical schools. 3.44. There is no veterinary counterpart to the state- funded National Health Service and the large majority of ve t e r i n a r y graduates work in private practice. T h e practising v e t e r i n a r y profession is ther e f o re the main ultimate beneficiary from the product of the veterinar y schools. The inescapable conclusion we come to is that the ve t e r i n a r y profession should contribute more than at present to veterinary undergraduate education. 3.45. Such a contribution could take a number of forms. Practices already make a major input by taking students on extramural studies, and there may be ways to build on this successful precedent by involving practitioners more e x t e n s i v ely in v e t e r i n a r y education. Selected practices might, for instance, pr ovide a setting for some of the clinical teaching which currently takes place in the clinics of the veterinary schools. Another possibility would be a financial contribution. Such contributions are w e l l - established in agriculture, where farmers now pay levies to a number of funding bodies. To cite one example, a dair y farmer with a 1m-litre quota would have an annual turno ver of appr oximately \u00a325 0000 and would contribute an annual levy of \u00a3300 to the Milk Development Council. A funding body might similarly be established to enable the veterinary profession to make a direct contribution toCHAPTER T H R E E 42the costs of clinical teaching in the veterinary schools. Such a levy could bring major benefits for clinical research, both by funding projects and by releasing academic clinicians from some of their teaching and service duties. 3.46. We do not suggest that the practising profession is the sole beneficiary of undergraduate v e t e r i n a r y education. Other major employers of v e t e r i n a r y graduates a re the v e t e r i n a r y schools themselves and MAFF , as e m p l o yers of full-time veterinarians and practitioners par t - time as Local V e t e r i n a r y Inspectors. We have alr e a d y suggested above that the M i n i s t r y might support postgraduate training posts in order to secure its par t i c u l a r need for v e t e r i n a r y graduates with particular skills. S u c h s u p p o r t would also go some way to r e c o g n i z e the benefit which MAFF derives from undergraduate v e t e r i n a r y e d u c a t i o n . 3 . 47.We recommend that the v e t e r i n a r y schools, the profession and MAFF (as the major public sector user of the services of veterinary graduates) should review the financial arrangements for clinical veterinary teaching. Those who benefit from undergraduate v e t e r i n a r y education should contribute to the special costs of clinical teaching, so that clinical academic staff can combine a reduced teaching and service load with a proper involvement in research. FUNDING STRATEGY AND CO-ORDINATION 3.48. Under this heading we consider the funding of research projects by the major funding bodies. 3.49. We recognized abo ve that the funding bodies wer e bound to follow their own policies and priorities. Each funding body obviously needs to make sure that its spending programmes are achieving the results it intends, but it should also consider how its activities fit with those of other bodies. The evidence put to us suggested that ther e was a lack of strategic co-ordination in the funding of research on animal health and that in consequence effor t could be fragmented and research could be slow to respond to new challenges. It would be valuable if the majorfunding bodies severally and jointly revie wed their suppor t for research into animal health and welfare, looking for gaps in co verage and scope for joint ventures. As part of this process the funding bodies could usefully invite the main research pr oviders to contribute views on research priorities, on the location of major investments in infrastructure and on administrative systems. Funders and providers may not always agree with each other, but informed and responsible debate must be beneficial. 3.50. Werecommend that the funding bodies which sponsor or have an interest in veterinary research - notably BBSRC, MRC, the agriculture departments and the Wellcome Trust - should review the effectiveness and complementarity of their programmes, giving the main research contractors an opportunity to contribute, and should repeat this exercise from time to time. COLLABORATION AND SPECIALIZATION 3.51. The issues arising under this broad heading concern w o rking relations between the six v e t e r i n a r y schools and b e t ween them and the r e s e a r ch Institutes and other bodies. The evidence showed wide agreement on the need for the v e t e r i n a r y schools to identify and build on their special r e s e a rch strengths and to make use of the exper t i s e of other bodies. In undergraduate teaching they are constrained by the need to cover the full curriculum, but w h e r e re s e a rch is concerned there is no dissent over the need for specialization and for collaboration between the d i f f e r ent schools and between them and the neighbouring medical and biological departments, and between the u n i versities and the Institutes. Such collaboration would not only yield r e s e a rch benefits but would also create more o p p o r tunities to expose v e t e r i n a r y students to a range of high-quality r e s e a rc h . 3.52. We sympathize with the views of those who would like physically to bring together the universities and the re s e a rch Institutes, but it is not realistic to pr o p o s e incurring the major costs of relocation. Certainly the benefits of co-location should be borne in mind when considering developments for the future and changes forCHAPTER T H R E E 43other reasons. In the meanwhile collaboration should be pursued in spite of geographical separation. If research teams can collaborate across the world, the veterinar y schools and Institutes within the UK can certainly wor k together if they have the will. 3.53. There are promising developments. In Scotland, where a range of agricultural and biological disciplines operate within a 50-mile radius, there is scope to develop centres of excellence that could be unrivalled in Europe. We heard about the closer working relationship which the Moredun Research Institute is building with the Scottish veterinary schools and other institutions. Other research Institutes have links with a wide range of university departments in the UK and abroad but relatively weak connections with v e t e r i n a r y schools. The special and expensive facilities of publicly funded research institutions, such as isolation accommodation for large animals, should be available for collaborative studies with the veterinar y schools. The pr oximity of the Animal Health T rust and the University of Cambridge does not seem to have been exploited, and the links between the schools and the MAFF Veterinary Investigation Centres seem to be getting weaker even though both sides told us that they would welcome closer collaboration. 3.54. We detected a problem of attitudes, and it does not help when bodies which could benefit from working together have contrasting institutional cultures and traditions. If two organizations are to o vercome such obstacles and take advantage of each other 's strengths, each must first be convinced that the other has something valuable to offer .The Institutes have specialized expertise and infrastructure which the veterinary schools cannot hope to emulate. The latter, on the other hand, hav e unrivalled clinical skill and knowledge, are well placed to tap the expertise of neighbouring university departments, benefit from an annual injection of young talent, and hav e access to a range of sources of funding. Both sides need to trade on their advantages in order to present themselves as desirable research partners. By pooling their resources, moreo ver, the Institutes and schools will be well placed to convince the major funding bodies that they should invest in new centres of excellence.3.55. Within the university sector, co-ordination between the six veterinary schools is impeded by their long tradition of independence. In private discussion they agree that they need to respect each other 's areas of research specialization and develop complementary roles, but they have not as yet made public a shared strategy for developing their research strengths. The flagged research groups identified in the Research Assessment E xercises pr ovide one starting point. Institutional change takes time, but a public statement of the aim can be a major step toward realizing it. A declared strategy could also help to persuade funding bodies to invest in new infrastructure. It might co ver collaboration and specialization at regional, national and European levels, take account of gr owth areas such as food safety and comparative medicine and build in ways of exposing veterinary undergraduates to leading edge research. 3.56. Werecommend that: the research Institutes and veterinary schools should s h a re the use of existing specialized facilities and co-operate in making the case for new investment in centres of excellence; the v e t e r i n a r y schools, Institutes, gov e rn m e n t laboratories and Veterinary Investigation Centres should c o l l a b o r ate and, where appropriate, form r e g i o n a l groupings; each veterinary school should develop its own areas of research based on the starred areas in the Research Assessment E xercises, pr ovided, of course, those areas continue to be actively pursued. These areas for each school should be agreed between the schools and published as statements of individual and common s t ra t e g y. The v e t e r i n a r y schools should exploit the complementary strengths of other bodies. MACHINERY FOR CONSUL TATION AND CO-ORDINATION 3.57. We have recommended above that the major emplo yers of veterinarians in research should assess their re c ruitment needs and take stock collectively of the p rovision for v e t e r i n a r y re s e a r ch training and car e e r d e velopment; that the bodies which fund v e t e r i n a r yCHAPTER T H R E E 44research should jointly review their programmes from time to time, with an input from the main research contractors; and that the veterinary schools should agree the areas in which they will specialize. 3.58. We hesitate to propose new machinery for these purposes, because debate o ver the membership and terms of reference of committees can easily be a substitute for action. The priority is for the emplo yers, funding bodies and veterinary schools to set in hand the reviews and discussions recommended above, and none of these requires a new forum. N ew administrative arrangements on a modest scale could nevertheless offer benefits. 3.59. We would see advantage, first, in the heads of the veterinary schools setting up an interest group to represent them collectively in dealing with the funding bodies and other institutions. They must of course compete separately for project and programme grants, but they need to speak with one voice if, for instance, they wish to convince BBSRC that it should locate new infrastructure in the veterinary schools or debate with the profession the level of its support for clinical teaching. 3.60. Our second proposal is that the heads of r e s e a rch in the v e t e r i n a r y schools, Institutes and other bodies engaged in r e s e a r ch into animal health and w e l f a re should meet formally to promote collaboration and c o - o r dination. Such meetings would not replace the normal bilateral communications between partners in p a rticular projects, but could be used to agree a common re s e a r ch strategy between the v e t e r i n a r y schools, identify possibilities for major initiatives and seek to r e m ove obstacles to r e s e a r ch collaboration. 3.61. We propose, thirdly, that all the bodies which w e have invited to take action - the major emplo yers of veterinarians in research, the main funding bodies, the main research pr oviders, and the RCVS as the regulating authority for veterinary education - should come together in a year 's time to review progress. The RCVS, as the instigator (through its T rust Fund) of our Enquir y, would be the natural body to convene this revie w.3.62. If this follow-up exercise pr oved valuable it might be repeated annually and the parties might also consider establishing a forum for this purpose. A possible model for such a forum would be the UK Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research which helps the main funders of cancer research to co-ordinate their activities and gives the re s e a rch providers an opportunity to contribute. T h e Committee now has a well-developed organization and handles substantial funds, but it grew from modest beginnings. Any similar organization to co-or d i n a t e veterinary research would need to be simple at its inception and realistic in its aims, but the UK Co-or d i n a t i n g Committee shows what can be achieved given the will. 3.63. Werecommend that the heads of the veterinary schools should set up an interest group to represent the schools collectively in dealings with other bodies; the heads of research in the bodies engaged in research into animal health and welfare should meet formally to promote collaboration and co-ordination; the bodies affected by our recommendations should jointly review progress in a year 's time, the review being convened by the RCVS. THE SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE VETERINARY SCHOOLS 3.64. Our remit was broad, and within it we have considered and made recommendations on a range of issues of different kinds. Most of our recommendations, however, affect the university veterinary schools, and w e return to them in a final comment. 3.65. The schools make an impr e s s i ve job of responding to d i verse and not wholly compatible demands from differ e n t q u a rters. They are institutions of higher education with a duty to develop the personal and intellectual capital of the ve ry talented young people who pass through them as students. They are centres of learning with a responsibility to a d vance science through published r e s e a rch, and these days they face serious financial penalties if they neglect to do so.CHAPTER T H R E E 45The schools are clinical training establishments, formally charged to deliver veterinary graduates competent to giv e medical and surgical care to a wide and gr owing range of species. They also run animal hospitals. It is not surprising if the strain of rising to all these different expectations sometimes shows. It would be remarkable if the clinical academic staff managed to maintain a full involvement in research of top quality at the same time as responding to all the other calls on their time. 3.66. The v e t e r i n a r y sciences are not unusual in having to cope with financial pr e s s u r es and a changing externale n v i r onment by working hard, cutting costs and constantly looking for new ways to be more efficient. In our view, how e ve r, the v e t e r i n a r y schools have difficulties which will not be solved by the continuing application of such measures, because they are not funded for the v e ry special job which they do. It is time for the ve t e r i n a r y schools and those who benefit from their work jointly to consider what the schools can reasonably achieve and what should be r e q u i r ed of them in the future. T h e y should look to the v e t e r i n a r y profession and the major e m p l o yers of v e t e r i n a r y graduates to share some of the costs of meeting these expectations.CHAPTER T H R E E 46ANNEX A:THE COMMITTEE Chairman: The Earl rian Follett PhD DSc Hon J S Gill ANNEX B:THE INVIT ATION TO GIVE EVIDENCE The Committee of Enquiry has been set up by the R oyal College of Veterinary Surgeons in the light of concerns about the future development of veterinary research in the UK and its view that an o verall long-term strategy for veterinary science and research is needed in order to ensur e the best use of resources and identify any areas wher e greater depth and breadth of research may be required.

Our enquiry did not start from a blank sheet. We looked at the results of earlier studies, notably: the review of research and development in farm animal diseases carried out by P rofessor Peter Wildy's working party; the Working Party on Veterinary Education chaired by Sir Ralph Riley; the Working Party on Veterinary Undergraduate Education chaired by Dr Jeremy Lucke; and the r e v i ew of the role of the Agricultural and F o o d Re s e a r ch Council in v e t e r i n a r y re s e a r ch and re s e a r ch training carried out by a group chaired by Professor Brian P i c k e r i n g . D.2. Their recommendations are noted below. Not all we re adopted, and some have become less r e l e vant with the passage of time, but they nev e rtheless gave us valuable pointers. W I L DY REPORT D.3. The Working Party chaired by the late P rofessor Peter Wildy was commissioned by the Agriculture Departments in G reat Britain and the former Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC) to review public sector funded re s e a r ch and development in diseases of agricultural animals and recommend a framework for the future. The Working Party reported in July 1987, the chair having been taken o ver by D rW B Martin of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland following the death of Professor Wildy in March that year .D.4. The report made the following recommendations for the short term: c o - o rdination of farm animal disease R & D: \"We recommend that to improve the co-ordination of farm animal disease R & D and facilitate the effective c o - o r dination of funds, a properly serviced Animal Disease Co-ordinating Board (ADCB) be established. The Board would have a UK remit to advise the Sponsors and Priorities Board on: (a)co-ordination of programmes, (b)the most appropriate distribution of funds from multiple sources, (c)the priorities for farm animal disease R & D, (d)the value of no vel ideas for possible support.\" assessing industr y's need s: \" We recommend that the establishment of Species Discussion G roups be encouraged which could act as a forum for the needs of the industry and advise the ADCB appropriately.\" fundin g: \"We recommend that: ( a )sufficient funds should be available to meet the basic R & D needs of the agricultural industry. It is ther e f o re essential that there be no further reductions in the funding of farm animal disease R & D, (b) establishments should remain free to seek funding f rom public and private sources and to benefit dir e c t l y f rom this funding, (c) the livestock industry be urged to contribute mor e significantly to R & D, (d) other industry funding be encouraged, (e) these funding sources (c) and (d) abo ve should not exceed 20% of the total spent on R & D at any one establishment, (f) other funding sources, especially charities and trusts, be welcomed and that they be encouraged to fund work that go vernment finds difficult to support.\"ANNEX D 51training and related resear ch: \" We recommend that urgent attention be given by the UGC, universities and v e t e r i n a r y schools to impr oving the research base in the schools and training of veterinary graduates for a research career . This can be assisted by: ( a )the extension of the AFRC Link scheme and its orientation to w a rds both the institutes and univ e r s i t i e s , (b)establishing research groups in the veterinary schools funded by the AFRC and charitable trusts, (c)providing support and opportunity for interchange of staff between veterinary schools and other research centres, (d)encouraging collaboration both within and between establishments, (e)increased pr ovision of pump-priming grants, (f)enlarging the amount of awards and support grants for veterinary postgraduate students at universities and other centres of expertise, (g)a greater emphasis on disciplinary training.\" recruitmen t: \"We recommend that recruitment into research be improved by: (a)open recruitment at all grades of veterinary and science staff , (b)increased flexibility to seek funding from all sources to employ short-term staff where necessar y, (c)providing the opportunity for short-term contracts of 3-5 years for postgraduates and post-doctorates.\" restructuring the R & D establishment s: \" We recommend the rationalisation of the r e s o u r ces and responsibilities of MAFF and the AFRC by a re s t ructuring of the present establishments and their functions. T o achieve this we strongly recommend the adoption of the following option subject to a detailed feasibility study by MAFF and AFRC: (a)the DES funds used at Pirbright Laboratory to transfer to Compton Laborator y,( b )Pirbright Laboratory to come under the management of MAFF and be of a size appr o p r i a t e to MAFF's needs, (c)non-statutory poultry work at CVL transfers to Houghton Laboratory and comes under its management, (d)the laboratories at Compton, Houghton, Pirbright and Weybridge to remain at their existing sites.\" D.5. For the longer term the Working Party made the following recommendations: establishing an e xecutive bod y: \"We recommend that a new body be established, or an existing one adapted, which would assume an executive function with the following responsibilities for the UK: (a)to act as a common employing authority for all veterinary laboratory staff within the SVS, the VIS in GB, the AFRS and the VRL, (b) to ensure the integration and co-ordination of all aspects of the veterinary laboratory services including statutory and service work, associated R & D and all other research.\" restructuring the laboratorie s: \"We recommend that detailed consideration be given to a major reorganization of the UK's animal disease laboratories with the aim of establishing an integrated s e rvice with the following str u c t u r e and r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s : (a)6 laboratories in the UK, each of 25 0 -300 people, to be associated with universities and, where possible, the veterinary schools, (b)each laboratory to have regional diagnostic responsibilities integral with the VIS, (c)each laboratory to develop a lead responsibility for a species and, or, discipline(s), (d) each laboratory to be supported by an A d v i s o r y B o a rd . \"ANNEX D 52RILEY REPORT D.6. The Working Party on Veterinary Education chaired by Sir Ralph Riley reported in January 1989 to the Un i versity Grants Committee, making the follo w i n g recommendations: recommendation 1: \"It is recommended that basic science courses should be strengthened, that adequate pr ovision should be available for students to intercalate work for a science degree into veterinary courses and that universities should encourage them to do so.\" recommendation 2: \" The W o rking P a rty recommends the v e rt i c a l integration of veterinary education but recognizes that the process, although re w a rding to all concerned, is time consuming and can only be applied when appropriate links between disciplines are possible. It should not be implemented if it leads to a reduction in the study of basic sciences.\" (This referred to integration between the pre-clinical, para-clinical and clinical phases of the course, with, for instance, anatomy teachers collaborating with surgeons on functional and surgical anatomy.) recommendation 3: \" It is recommended that pre-clinical, para-clinical, and clinical v e t e r i n a r y teaching should continue at the U n i versities of Bristol, Liverpool and London and that a single Scottish School of V e t e r i n a r y Studies should be created by merging parts of the ve t e r i n a r y activities at the U n i versities of E d i n b u r g h and G l a s g o w. The Scottish School of V e t e r i n a r y Studies should be in the U n i versity of E d i n b u r g h , utilizing the sites already committed to v e t e r i n a r y education. Each of the four universities with responsibility for awarding registrable v e t e r i n a r y d e g rees should have the capacity to teach 85 students in each of the para-clinical and clinical years. With the present overall annual intake of 302students each university should also have not less than 36 clinical teachers in the pr o f e s s o r , reader or l e c t u r er grades. Any increases in student numbers should be accompanied by increases in the numbers of clinical teachers to maintain staff:student ratios close to 1: 4. Each university should have four Residency posts (see recommendation 10). It is f u rther recommended that pre-clinical teaching of ve t e r i n a r y students to tripos level should continue at Cambridge but for para-clinical and clinical studies these students should move to one of the four u n i versities which have that capability. Clinical and para-clinical teaching posts at Cambridge should be used to r e i n f o r ce the teaching strengths of u n i versities continuing with these r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s , but principally London and Bristol. The teaching s t rength at Liverpool should be r e i n f o r ced by the m ovement of posts from Edinburgh or G l a s g o w f o l l owing the creation of a staff complement of about 36 clinical and pr o p o rtionate numbers of pr e - and para-clinical teachers in the Scottish School of Ve t e r i n a r y St u d i e s . \" recommendations 4, 5, 6 and 7 c o n c e r n e d arrangements for bringing about the changes p roposed in recommendation 3. recommendation 8: \"It is recommended that each university r e v i ews its arrangements for the placement of students when they 'see practice' in the community of v e t e r i n a r y surgeons to ensure that the maximum educational benefit is obtained from this pr o c e s s . \" recommendation 9: \"It is recommended that the final year of undergraduate ve t e r i n a r y teaching should consist of at least 46 w e e k s of work so that students can more readily follow the complete course of treatment of many animal patients and to extend their opportunities to gain 'hands on' practical experience prior to their obtaining p rofessional qualifications.\"ANNEX D 53recommendation 1 0: \"Each of the universities teaching clinical v e t e r i n a r y medicine should have four Residency posts suppor t e d f rom General Funds in part by the r e d e p l o yment of the re s o u r ces used previously to support junior clinicians at Cambridge and G l a s g ow / E dinburgh. These R e s i d e n t s should be additional to those employed by univ e r s i t i e s using funds from non-UGC sources. Residents will gain advanced skills in a clinical discipline or a species specialty as a pr e l i m i n a r y to specialist practice or to clinical teaching. Appointments as Residents will be held for not more than three y e a r s . \" recommendation 1 1: \" It is recommended that the heads of v e t e r i n a r y schools should jointly discuss with the D i rectors of the AFRC IAH, Compton, and of the AHT, Ne w m a r ket, ways in which the capabilities of these institutions can be used in the education of v e t e r i n a r y undergraduates. This can take the form either of taught courses or by e l e c t i v e training at Compton and Ne w m a rk e t . Ap p ropriate costs of the arrangements that may be a g reed should be a charge on university general funds f rom the UGC.\" recommendation 1 2: \"It is recommended that research should play a greater p a rt in the work on v e t e r i n a r y science in the u n i versities. Concentration of teachers in few e r universities will enable clinical research, which has been of modest achievement thus far, to expand to the benefit of teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In seeking support for research, from sources outside universities, care should be exercised to constrain acceptance of contracts or p rojects with limited intellectual content. It is important that research undertaken with outside s u p p o r t should contribute to knowledge in the widest sense and enhance the scientific competence and confidence of the veterinary workers whose reputations and career prospects should benefit from their work on the projects.\"LUCKE REPORT D.7. The Working Party on Veterinary Undergraduate Education chaired by Dr Jeremy Lucke, Chairman at the time of the Education Committee of the R oyal College of Veterinary Surgeons, reported to the College in October 1991 following a review undertaken in pursuance of its statutory role in supervising veterinary education. It made the following recommendations: recommendation 1 , re s o u r ces for undergraduate ve t e r i n a r y education in the UK: \" The Royal College must seek to ensure proper funding for undergraduate education in the UK; must encourage the univ e r s i t i e s to make the most effective use of their r e s o u r ces on a UK (and E u ropean) rather than on an individual basis; and must seek ways of utilizing the r e s o u r ces of the private sector, state v e t e r i n a r y service and r e s e a rc h and commercial institutions by closer integration.\" recommendation 2 , the undergraduate curriculum: \"Changes in the Veterinar y Training Directive should be discussed and implemented without delay. Such changes should recognize not only the developments in veterinary science and the needs of society but accept changing attitudes to education. T h e Directive should make clear that the priority for the veterinary profession is the health and welfare of animals in the Community as well as their impact on public health and the environment. The UK ve t e r i n a r y degree should remain the sole and sufficient qualification to practise as a veterinar y surgeon in the UK.\" recommendation 3 , duration of the course: \"The 5-year course resulting in a registrable qualification should be retained.\" recommendation 4 , features of a 'model curriculum ' : \" Fu rther encouragement should be given to the intercalation of degrees within the veterinary course. The subjects taken should be wide in scope.\"ANNEX D 54recommendation 5 , features of a 'model curriculum': \" It is also recommended that the Royal College should continue to press for funding of students to inter c a l a t e d e g rees because v e t e r i n a r y surgeons with this type of training are needed. It may be that, at a time of change f rom local to central funding, this might now be the o p p o r tunity to apply such pr e s s u re . \" recommendation 6 , features of a 'model curriculum': \"The Working Party was convinced of the advantages of a term-free lecture-free final year and recommends that the schools should give serious consideration to the implementation of such a final year comprising clinical rotations, extra-mural rotations and electiv e periods. Extra-mural rotations should be regarded as an integral part of the clinical course - comprising a final year of at least 48 weeks and earlier clinical years of at least 45 weeks each. On this basis the R oyal College should press for the funding of students in the three clinical years at the full-time rate that is applicable to medical students.\" recommendation 7 , electives: \"Each school should provide elective periods at least during the final year , which are sufficiently long (at least 12 weeks) to allow study in depth or involvement in a project. The advantages of electives being taken outside the parent school should be recognised.\" recommendation 8 , staffing: \"The R oyal College should seek, with the universities, to find ways of providing a career structure for teachers in veterinar y schools, which will stimulate basic and clinical research, allow high standards of clinical care andreward veterinarians with skill and dedication to undergraduate education.\" , extra-mural rotations (EMR): \"The term should be abandoned and replaced with extramural rotations. E x t r a m u r a l rotations should be an integral part of the degree course and pr ovide structured use of the students ' time, and a closer relationship between school and practice or other institution. An extramural rotation should only be accepted as part of the course if it is u n d e r taken in a practice or other institution recognized for the purpose by the schools and the Royal College.\" recommendation 10 , teaching of r e g u l a t o r y medicine, public health and food hygiene: \"The Royal College should seek appropriate suppor t , including that of the Chief Veterinary Officer, to press for funding for this increased professional responsibility .The R oyal College should carefully monitor the pr o g ress to high standards of the undergraduate course in regulatory medicine, public health and food hygiene. If necessar y, the R oyal College should use its po wers under the Veterinar y Surgeons Act to make specific enquiry into these aspects of the course.\" recommendation 11 , undergraduate entry re q u i r ements: \"The selection of v e t e r i n a r y undergraduates should remain the responsibility of the university v e t e r i n a r y schools but it would be expected that the system in place would always be under r e v i ew. \"ANNEX D 55PICKERING REPORT D.8. We were grateful to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for allowing us to see an internal document, a report of July 1993 from a G roup chaired b y Professor Brian Pickering which revie wed the role of the former Agricultural and Food R e s e a r ch Council in veterinary research and research training. The Revie w Group made the following recommendations: recommendation 1 \"If the AFRS is to meet its recruitment needs for veterinary scientists, it should encourage its institutes to interact more positively with the v e t e r i n a r y schools and actively promote farm animal research at the undergraduate level. This should include the provision of opportunities for electives and vacation studentships.\" recommendation 2 \"The AFRS should participate in the pr ovision of summer schools for v e t e r i n a r y undergraduates. Preferably, these should be held at institutes with large animal facilities, in order that students may benefit from the pr oximity to farm animal research.\"recommendation 3 \"AFRC should consider the introduction of a four-year research training programme for veterinary graduates which would pr ovide a year 's specialist training, followed by a standard three-year research project leading to a PhD. This would be in line with proposals set out in the G overnment's White Paper on science and technology.\" recommendation 4 \"Opportunities should be pr ovided for the secondment of veterinary school staff to institutes and vice versa.\" recommendation 5 \"A F RC should consider how to further the establishment in the v e t e r i n a r y schools of centres of e xcellence in areas of strategic importance. In doing so, the Council should consult with other bodies i n t e rested in the advancement of v e t e r i n a r y science, or which have a need for r e s e a rc h - t r a i n e d veterinarians, such as the Wellcome T rust and the UK a g r i c u l t u r e departments.
