Using natural gas will help reduce the amount of harmful emission released into the atmosphere. Natural gas is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and non-carcinogenic, and can spark-ignited internal combustion engines, like traditional fossil fuels, without being a threat to soil, surface water, or groundwater. Natural gas can be extracted from gas and oil well, mostly commonly referred to as hydraulic fracturing. Natural gas is mostly used for residential home, commercial office places, industrial uses, and electric power production. Currently only one tenth of a percent natural gas used goes toward transportation fuel. Natural Gas Production Most of the natural gas consumed, is produced in the United States. Small exports are made overseas and from Canada. Overseas exportation is small, but growing rapidly. A push to produce more natural gas domestically is being made in state, such as, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas, and Wyoming. Most natural gas is fossil fuel formed by heat and pressure on organic material and form over millions of years. Natural gas can come from landfill gas and water/sewage treatment, coal-derived, or gas that's trapped in sub-surface porous rock reservoirs and extracted via "}
