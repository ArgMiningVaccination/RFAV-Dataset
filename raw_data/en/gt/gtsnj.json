The Dashboard allow s organizations and EPs to log-in to a web- based tool and access their 2015 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) data on a quarterly basis in order to monitor the status of claims -based individual measures. Additional information about the 2015 PQRS requirements is available on the Center s for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) website at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient -Assessment -Instruments/PQRS . Note : The Dashboard does not provide the final data analysis for full -year reporting, or subjectivity to the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment or the value- based payment modifier to be implemented in 2017 . The Dashboard will only provide claims -based data for 2015 interim feedback. Data submitted via registry reporting, qualified clinical data registry (QCDR), Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) Web Interface, Center s for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI, includes Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations [ ACO ] participants), Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs , or qualified Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems will not be included for purposes of the 2015 Dashboard data feedback . Data submitted for 2015 PQRS reporting via methods other than claims will be available for review in the fall of 2015 through the final PQRS feedback r eport. PQRS Program Overview The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act (TRHCA) authorized a physician quality reporting system, including an incentive payment , for EPs who satisfactorily report ed data on quality measures for Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) covered professional services furnished to Medicare Fee- for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries during the second half of 2007. CMS named this program the Physician Quality Reporting Initia tive (PQRI) , which was renamed Physician Quality Reporting System or PQRS in 2011. PQRS was further modified as a result of The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act (MMSEA) and the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) . MMSEA authorized CMS to establish two alternative reporting periods ; the reporting of measures groups , and submission of data on PQRS quality measures through clinical data registries. The Affordable Care Act authorized payment adjustments beginning in 2 015. For each program year, CMS implements PQRS through an annual rulemaking process published in the Federal Register . The program has expanded the number of measures and reporting options over time to facilitate quality reporting by a broad array of elig ible professionals. PQRS for the 2015 calendar year continues as a reporting program that includes claims -, registry -, qualified clinical data registry -, electronic health record (EHR) -, CMS -certified survey vendor, and Group Practice Reporting Option ( GPRO) Web Interface- based reporting of data on 254 total quality measures , 22 measures groups , 17 GPRO Web Interface measures (including subcomponents of composite measures), and 12 summary survey modules for CAHPS for PQRS . The reporting period for this program year i s January 1, 2015- December 31, 2015. There are 9 options for satisfactorily reporting quality measures data for 2015 PQRS that differ based on the reporting period, the reporting option (individual measures or measures group[s] ), and the selected data collection method (claims, participating registry, qualified clinical data registry, qualified/participating EHR, CMS -certified survey vendor, or GPRO Web Interface). I n 2017 , the program also applies a payment adjustment to EPs who did not satisfactorily report data on quality measures for covered professional services during the 2015 program year . For more information on the 2015 PQR S, please visit the CMS website at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives - Patient -Assessment -Instruments/PQRS . Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244 V2.0 07/10/2015 Page 5 of 21 Dashboard Overview The Affordable Care Act of 2010 called for \"timely feedback to eligible professionals on the performance of the eligible professional with respect to satisfactorily submitting data on quality measures.\" As timely feedback is already provided, CMS indicated in the 2012- 2014 PFS fi nal rule the introduction of the D ashboard as an additional tool for EPs to review their interim performance in PQRS. The Dashboard allow s organizations and EPs to log- in and access their interim 2015 PQRS reported data on a quarterly basis in order to monitor the status of claims -based individual measures reporting. The Dashboard should not be used to determine final data analysis for full -year program reporting. The Dashboard is available to each TIN with at least one EP who submits one or more denominator -eligible Medicare Part B PFS claims . The Dashboard will display the most current data available on a cumulative quarterly basis for claims with dates of service during the following interim report periods, and processed into the National Claims Histor y (NCH) b y the given deadlines as follows: Dashboard Data - Quarterly Claims Processin g Dashboard Data Quarters Claims Date s of Service Processed into NCH Deadline 1st Quarter (3 -months) January 1 -March 31, 2015 April 2 9, 2015 2nd Quarter (6 -months cumulative) January 1 -June 30, 2015 July 29, 2015 3rd Quarter (9 -months cumulative) January 1 -September 30, 2015 Octo ber 28, 2015 4th Quarter (12 -months cumulative) January 1 -December 31, 2015 January 2 7, 201 6 All Medicare Part B claims submitted for services furnished from January 1- December 31, 2015 and processed through January 27, 2016 will be analyzed to determine the EP's interim participation in 2015 PQRS. The Dashboard will analyze data for those eligible professionals who reported individual measures ' quality -data codes (QDCs ) to CMS via claims . Participation in PQRS is analyzed at the individual NPI -level within a Tax ID (TIN/NPI) . Data provided through the Dashboard is separate from the f inal PQRS f eedback reports that will be released in the f all of 2016. Dashboard Content and Appearance Dashboard data can be viewed as a TIN summary or as individual NPI detail. The TIN -level data (Table 1) provides a summary of claim s submission data from all individual/rendering NPIs under the organizational TIN. NPI -level data (Table 2) provides detail of claims submission data from individual /rendering NPIs. Both TIN - and NPI -level data provide cumulative interim analysis for 2015 PQRS individual m easures and on a quarterly basis throughout the program year . Following are examples and additional information about the TIN - and NPI -level Dashboard data and appearance. Table 1: Interim Reporting Summary for the Taxpayer Identification Number (Tax ID or TIN) TIN-level analysis of claims submission from all individual/rendering NPIs under the organizational TIN will be available to authorized CMS Enterprise Identity Management System (EIDM ) account users . TIN -level data will be provided in Table 1: Interim Reporting Summary for the Taxpayer Identification Number (Tax ID or TIN), and will analyze each individual NPI who submitted at least one QDC on a Medicare Part B PFS claim during the applicable 2015 PQRS interim report period (see Example 1.1). The Dashboard will provide the following data: Total # Measures Reported: The tot al number of different individual measures reported for TIN/NPI (identified by measure- specific QDCs received) regardless of accuracy of reporting. The provider will see how many individual measures were accurately reported in the next field titled \"Total # Measures Accurately Reported.\" Total # Measures Accurately Reported: The total number of different individual measures reported for TIN/NPI based upon valid QDC submissions . Valid reporting is defined by numerator and denominator re quirements as outlined in the measure specification. Total # Cross Cutting Measures Reported: The number of Cross Cutting measures reported by each TIN/NPI . Total # Domains Covered by Measures Accurately Reported: The number of domains in which measures were reported with a valid QDC. This does not necessarily indicate that satisfactory reporting criteria have been met. For definition of terms related to Dashboard TIN -level data see Appendix A .

The final 2015 PQRS feedback r eports will be available f all of 2016. The f inal 2015 PQRS f eedback r eport will be issued at different times, and independent of Dashboard data. The Dashboard will only include those EPs who reported individual measures ' QDCs to CMS via claims during the specified report period. Dashboard data does not indicate subjectivity to the 2017 PQRS payment adjustment. Dashboard interim data will show a rolling 2 years availability. If all of the 2015 PQRS QDCs submitted by individual EPs are not denominator -eligible events for the 2015 PQRS measure, the NPI-level Dashboard will be populated with zeroes in most or all of the numeric fields of the tables . If a provider sees \" 0\" reporting displayed, but is certain QDCs were entered on Part B claims, the provider should look for the N 620 remark code on remittance advice to determine if the QDC was processed, as PQRS reporting codes may have been stripped by claims software or by a clearinghouse. Claims may not be resubmitted only to add QDCs . Please call the QualityNet Help Desk for assistance in this circumstance. Note: The N620 remark code does NOT indicate whether the QDC is accurate for that claim or for the measure the eligible professional attempted to report. Dashboard Messages The \" No Data Available\" message will appear for the following reasons: o An invalid or Group NPI , or invalid TIN entry o GPRO TIN/NPI entry (includes CMMI participants , such as Pioneer ACO s, and Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs) o There is no PQRS data available for report type or report period requested o The organization or eligible professional's enrollment record or enrollment changes have not been processed and established in the national PECOS database at the time this report was produced (Table 1 only) The \"Invalid Number\" message will appear for the following reasons: o If the TIN user enters less than 10 digits into the NPI # text field box o If the TIN user enters 10 or less alpha or alpha numeric characters into the NPI # text field box o If the NPI user enters less than 9 digits into the TIN # text field box o If the NPI user enters 9 or less alpha or alpha numeric characters into the TIN # text field box Help/Troubleshooting Following are helpful hints and troubleshooting information: The report may not function optimally, correctly, or at all with some older versions of Microsoft\u00ae Windows , Microsoft\u00ae Internet Explorer , or Mozilla\u00ae Firefox .
