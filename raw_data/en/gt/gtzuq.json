Allow us to introduces ourselves; bloom balance is a curated apothecary of wellness items dedicated to helping people find a moment to indulge in self-care while relieving their aches and pains from home. This has been a passion of ours - bringing our in-clinic rituals home to you and we're so excited that we've been able to share our first launch with the world, our bloom balance ear seeds. These specially created beads were designed to heal and balance the body and mind, for wellness and mindfulness whenever and wherever you need it. What exactly are healing ear seeds? Our bloom balance healing ear seeds are small, ionized and tonifying beads made of 24K gold or silver that are used to stimulate pressure points in the ear helping to reduce stress and anxiety, balance the body and mind, and promote overall health and well-being. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the ear is believed to be a representation of the entire body as a whole. There are dozens of points on the ear that correspond to different areas and functions of the body - such as the gut, brain, and heart. Applying a little pressure to these points with a small ionized seed can stimulate the flow of energy, creating balance and wellness throughout the body. How do you apply them? It's as easy as place, press, and heal! Peel the seed from the paper backing. Place it on the desired ear point. Press gently to fix to the ear. Let the healing begin - no fancy tricks or skills needed! Once applied, they'll last up to 5 days, even through showers and sleep. Need a hand? Watch our video here. What can they be used for? Our relief rituals are customized to balance both the body and mind. Whether you need relief from pain or discomfort, are seeking mental and emotional clarity or are just craving a moment of mindfulness, these rituals will help you heal, flourish, and bloom - helping you feel your best self. Included in each ear seed kit is an educational, easy-to-follow, illustrative relief rituals guide of healing acupressure points commonly stimulated to help relieve a variety of conditions.
