We help people understand the past in order to make sense of the present and shape a more humane future.As part of the opening of 2 West, a 9-foot-tall LEGO Statue of Liberty stood inside the Museum's entrance. It is made of an estimated 25,375 LEGO pieces and weighs 125 pounds without its steel support. The sand-green structure took 292 hours to build. Below: Interactive wall in Many Voices, One Nation The Nation We Build Together Highlights Report 2017 1 That freedom lets us peaceably express ourselves, whether through our culture or the ballot box. But it also unites us. While oftentimes it seems as though our differences are what stand out, we are similar in more ways than we recognize. For example, the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the songs we sing \u2014 we often adapt elements of each other's culture and constantly reshape what it means to be American. We may not always agree with one another, but when we take time to truly listen to a neighbor, stranger or relative, we discover our commonalities and form bonds based on respect and empathy. Together we participate in our democracy and build stronger communities across this nation. In 2017, \"The Nation We Build Together\" served as the Museum's theme and reflected the transformation of the second floor's west wing. The wing inspires and challenges visitors while bringing the nation together around our most important American ideals and ideas. New exhibitions in the space \u2014 American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith; Many Voices, One Nation; and Religion in Early America \u2014 as well as the updated Within These Walls show that the Museum is living up to its mission. We are using the power of history to make sense of the present and shape a more humane future. These exhibitions and related educational programs engage and connect us all to the larger context of our country. We have seen enthusiastic, emotional and deeply personal responses. Every object and story in the wing played an important part in our shared past and still speak to us today. They make history more relevant to adults and children alike. Through the public's engagement, we can see how American history deeply matters to the lives of our visitors and to the nation. Our work continues! Focus now moves to the west wing's third floor. Beginning in 2018, we will explore American culture via a phased opening of spaces and exhibitions on our nation's entertainment history. By examining the past, we can better appreciate the power of entertainment and the essential role that American culture plays in shaping our values and national identity. Upon the project's completion, the three floors of the west wing will be devoted to the interwoven ideals and ideas of America. If you have not seen all of the changes to your national museum, we invite you to visit soon. Listen to new stories, participate in our interactive programs, read about the legends and lesser- known trailblazers, and continue to learn about this nation that we are still building ... together.For more than 200 years, Americans have been motivated by the ideal of freedom. By many different means, we have struggled to gain it, fought to defend it and negotiated the differences that it promotes between us. This ongoing pursuit of freedom for all is what makes us so unique. The Honorable Nicholas F. Taubman Board ChairmanJohn L. Gray Elizabeth MacMillan Director Many Voices, One Nation entrance3 National Museum of American HistoryA 12-ton marble statue of George Washington, set before a dramatic new backdrop in the wing's gateway, welcomed children and adults donning green foam Statue of Liberty crowns. They took in all of the objects in each space representing different elements of the American story, from civic engagement and the peopling of the nation to religion in the country's earliest days. Lady Liberty appeared in many forms, including as costumed greeters and as a 9-foot-tall LEGO model at the Museum's entrance. But a unique representation is found in the new exhibition Many Voices, One Nation holding a basket of tomatoes to symbolize the work of agricultural laborers. Other objects in the exhibition, located in the Hall of the American People, tell poignant and complex stories about how the many voices of people in America have shaped our nation. Leadership support from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation, as well as the generosity of our Family of Voices, helped bring this exhibition to fruition. Celebrating the Nation We Build Together Excitement filled the west wing of the National Museum of American History's second floor in June, as thousands of visitors poured into new exhibitions and spaces reflecting the year's theme, \"The Nation We Build Together.\" Across from Many Voices, One Nation stands Religion in Early America, in the Nicholas F. and Eugenia Taubman Gallery. The exhibition offers a look at the themes of religious diversity, freedom and growth from the Colonial era through the 1840s. In this gallery, made possible by the Taubmans, objects include Washington's 1732 christening robe from the Museum's collection and a loaned 18th-century Torah scroll damaged during the American Revolution. Visitors were also drawn into the Linda and Pete Claussen Hall of Democracy, where the exhibition American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith explores the democratic ideals and principles of the nation. It examines how generations of Americans have grappled with the same questions about self-government since declaring independence. In addition to the Claussens, the exceptional support of the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation; the Theodore Craver Family, in memory of Frederick Craver; and Diana Davis Spencer Foundation made possible a compelling look at citizenship in a pluralistic society, and political participation and engagement. Highlights include the inkstand President Abraham Lincoln used to draft the Emancipation Proclamation and contemporary items from political campaigns and movements. Media presentations and interactive stations, generously produced by History Channel | A+E Networks, animate the space and draw visitors into a deeper analysis of the exhibition themes and stories. New research into slavery and liberty during the Revolutionary War era was unveiled in Within These Walls. The exhibition, which opened in the wing in 2001, brings together the floor's themes. It features a two-and-a-half-story home that stood in Ipswich, Massachusetts, for 200 years and tells stories of occupants from the Colonial era to the early 1960s. Within These Walls continues to be made possible by leadership support from the National Association of Realtors.

Helping to make this exhibition experience possible, as well as related educational programming, were Linda and Pete Claussen with a $6 million commitment. The hall was named after the couple for their outstanding generosity. Pete Claussen, chairman and founder of Gulf & Ohio Railways, is an alumni board member at the Museum and a former board chairman. As such, he helped set the stage for its transformation. He also served on the Smithsonian National Board. The Claussens have contributed to many of the Museum's priority projects over the years, and their support has been invaluable in making American history, particularly democratic ideals, more relevant to the daily lives of visitors of all ages.Linda & Pete ClaussenDONOR SPOTLIGHT At the heart of the wing is Wallace H. Coulter Unity Square, overlooking the Washington Monument. A major gift from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation and its president, Sue Van, provides a space for activities that relate to the surrounding exhibitions' themes and inspire civic participation. The \"whites only\" Greensboro lunch counter is a powerful part of The Nation We Build Together . This interactive theater program tells the story of the four African American college students whose sit-in protest in 1960 led to a change in F.W. Woolworth's segregationist policy. In addition, American Experiments presents activities designed to stimulate conversation among visitors about American civic life. It was made possible by a gift from the Julie and Greg Flynn Family Fund and was developed by the Museum, in collaboration with the Exploratorium of San Francisco. \"The whole floor shares with us how communities and individuals have negotiated ideals such as freedom and democracy,\" said John Gray, the Museum's Elizabeth MacMillan Director. \"It is important to present these stories to encourage our visitors to think about their own role in shaping America's future.\"Above: John Gray, Mrs. Eugenia L.

Coulter Foundation. Under the direction of CEO and President Sue Van, the foundation assists efforts that encourage participation in the American democratic process, and it continues Coulter's practice of funding innovative initiatives. Its leadership was instrumental in the development of American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith and Many Voices, One Nation. In addition, Van, a Museum board member, recognized the importance of engaging individuals in dialogue about the nation's history and its relevance to Americans' daily lives. Located adjacent to the new exhibitions is Wallace H. Coulter Unity Square, where visitors participate in activities as a community. The variety of topics and themes covered in American Democracy and Many Voices, One Nation is reflected in programming for this approximately 4,200-square-foot central plaza. The foundation's support will bring history alive for millions of visitors for years to come.Wallace H.

Paul Neely Carnegie Corporation of New York Daniel K. Inouye Institute, a program fund of the Hawaii Community Foundation Ambassador and Mrs. Philip LaderEight years ago, the Division of Home and Community Life began an initiative on American cultural identity through the lens of immigration and migration. The project focused on how people came here, interacted, negotiated differences and, in the process, collectively built the nation together. As the project developed, we saw an opportunity and need to document untold stories of individuals who took many pathways to becoming American. Part of that effort was the creation of the Family of Voices, a group of 41 individuals with stories that contribute to a growing contemporary record of the American immigrant experience. Teams conducted oral histories and collected treasured objects, documents and photographs to chronicle the rich cultural heritage and careers of these notable entrepreneurs. In the early 1960s, the United States reformed immigration policy at a time when Americans were debating the ideals of civil equality and equal opportunity. These efforts resulted in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, or Hart-Celler Act. It gave visa preferences to reunite families and attract skilled labor, opening immigration from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Some Family of Voices members arrived as political refugees; others sought education and economic opportunity. While these newcomers often struggled to achieve a place in American society, many took risks and overcame failure with a tenacious entrepreneurial spirit. Their work led to significant advances in technology, medicine and business. Personal objects fill our lives and connect us with people. Items such as family heirlooms, articles of faith and religious devotion, jewelry and photographs tell the experiences of these immigrants, several of whom are represented in Many Voices, One Nation and Tracing American Journeys, the new exhibition and display, respectively, that resulted from our initiative. Additional stories can also be found at s.si.edu/voices. Just as we are a nation of nations, we are a nation of richly instructive American stories.

This timber-framed structure, which stood in Ipswich, Massachusetts, for 200 years, offers stories from Colonial days through the mid-1960s. But there were still stories to be shared. Continued research uncovered insights into slavery and liberty during the Revolution. Through a $1.7 million commitment from the National Association of Realtors, the Museum made the first of several updates to the exhibition in 2017. Within These Walls, which opened in 2001, was made possible by leadership support from the National Association of Realtors. The organization has generously agreed to become the exclusive sponsor of the exhibition from September 2018 through 2030. In 2018, a new case marks the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. Other future enhancements include interactive experiences to further engage young visitors, complemented by new content on the exhibition's website.National Association of Realtors DONOR SPOTLIGHTWhere Objects of Faith Knit Together an American Story CURATORIAL PERSPECTIVE Peter Manseau Lilly Endowment Curator of American Religious History, Division of Home and Community Life 8 National Museum of American HistorySince Religion in Early America opened in June, I have enjoyed spending time in the Nicholas F. and Eugenia Taubman Gallery watching people interact with the exhibition. Through observation and conversation with visitors, I have noticed that many are drawn, at first, to objects that reflect their own personal religious identity. Catholics might seek out the 17th-century iron cross on loan from Georgetown University. Protestants might look first to the 1640 Bay Psalm Book, made available for display by board member and Chair of the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents David M. Rubenstein. Jewish visitors, likewise, often examine the Torah scroll damaged during the Revolution, borrowed from Congregation Shearith Israel in New York, while Muslims look closely at the 19th-century Arabic manuscript written by an enslaved Islamic teacher, lent by the University of Georgia. Although many visitors initially feel a pull toward objects in which they see some element of their own lives and faiths reflected, everyone I've spoken to has agreed that the true power of encountering such objects at the Museum is to see them displayed together. It is the physical evidence of the freedom to worship that so many have sought. As a whole, the objects represent the extraordinary diversity of faiths that shaped the young nation. The Religion in Early America exhibition is a component of the broader Religion in America Initiative, made possible by Lilly Endowment Inc. The initiative explores the great variety of spiritual traditions that have called the United States home and presents them all in such a way that, both separately and together, they are shown as fully American. While our first religion- themed exhibition will close in summer 2018, until then and beyond we have planned a rich schedule of programs and events exploring the complex history of interaction between competing, conflicting and complementary worldviews, which over time have shaped American life.The Nation We Build Together Highlights Report 2017 9 Collecting Diamond Treasures The National Museum of American History was the site of a baseball fan's dream last August when Thomas and Alba Tull donated artifacts from the careers of Major League Baseball legends, including Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Ted Williams and Yogi Berra. All eyes were transfixed upon baseball jerseys, gloves, bats and other objects used by the players and meticulously displayed before attendees and media. Once part of the Tulls' private collection, more than a dozen artifacts are now included in the Museum's national sports collection. They represent six of the major league teams for which the athletes played. \"This is a very humbling experience,\" said Thomas Tull, a board member, after signing the deed of gift. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of Tulco, as well as the founding chairman and former CEO of Legendary Entertainment. Presented on a table were a baseball signed by the 1927 World Series New York Yankees team, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig; a bat and glove used by Berra while with the Yankees; a Boston Red Sox hat and jersey from Williams; and a hat, glove and shoes worn by Mays while on the San Francisco Giants' roster. Also on view were items used by Brooks Robinson with the Baltimore Orioles, Aaron with the Milwaukee Braves, and Ozzie Smith and Stan Musial with the St. Louis Cardinals. Later in the year, the Tulls made an additional donation of several objects from players such as Satchel Paige, Tony Gwynn and Pedro Martinez. \"Baseball, the nation's first popular team spectator sport, has had a long and lasting impact on our nation's cultural consciousness,\" said John Gray, the Elizabeth MacMillan Director of the National Museum of American History. \"It does so in a way that is both unique and vital.\" Sports artifacts will be displayed in 2020, among other American cultural treasures, within the upcoming exhibition Entertaining America. The recent acquisitions are part of a larger baseball collecting effort, which also includes the Latinos and Baseball Initiative. That community collecting initiative, in collaboration with the Smithsonian Latino Center, will result in an exhibition expected to open in 2020.

Below: Willie Mays' glove10 National Museum of American HistoryApril 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of America's official involvement in World War I. The war changed American society, and our place in the world, forever. One of the greatest changes was the expanding role of women, which would lead to suffrage in 1920. For the first time, tens of thousands of women donned uniforms to serve at home and abroad in civilian and military roles. Civilians joined groups like the American Fund for French Wounded and the Woman's Land Army of America, donning uniforms to provide war relief and replace men who had gone to battle. Women served as nurses in record numbers, including the first African Americans in the Army Nurse Corps. The Army, Navy and Marines opened their ranks to women as Signal Corps telephone operators, or \"Hello Girls,\" as yeomen (F) and Marine reservists (F). Reconstruction aides provided care for wounded soldiers in the new fields of physical and occupational therapy, and women doctors served as contract surgeons with the Army Medical Corps. The uniforms of these remarkable women are exhibited at the Museum in Uniformed Women in the Great War and Modern Medicine and the Great War. Recently, the war took on a personal note when I learned that my Museum blog post A Mother's Solace: A Letter From a World War I Enemy led to a reunion of two families joined by the war. In 1918, American aviator Louis Bennett was killed while firing on the balloon of German officer Emil Merkelbach. After the war, Merkelbach wrote to Bennett's mother to honor his bravery. Nearly a century later, Congressman David B. McKinley read his family's story on the blog and tracked down the Merkelbach family. In May, McKinley met with Merkelbach's descendants in Berlin to share more about their previously unknown family history. It is a reminder of the power of history to affect lives for generations to come.The Great War's Enduring Story CURATORIAL PERSPECTIVE Patri O'Gan Project Assistant, Division of Armed Forces History Remembering World War I U ncle Sam's call to action during the Great War resonated with American men and women who would contribute to developments in medicine, to advancements in women's rights efforts and to the level of creativity used in messaging on the home front. In 2017, these stories were explored when the Museum commemorated the centennial anniversary of the United States' involvement in World War I with displays and programs that vividly gave a closer look at this momentous period. Gen. John J. Pershing and World War I, 1917-1918 The awesome task of commanding 2 million American soldiers was represented by the desk and chair from Gen. John J. Pershing's war room, and a reproduction of his wartime map used to track troops. It serves as the new landmark display for the east wing of the Museum's third floor. Modern Medicine and the Great War This case demonstrated the immense challenge of treating the wounds and diseases of men in battle and highlighted medical breakthroughs. Science-based developments were transformational, such as identifying microorganisms behind diseases and establishing sterile surgical procedures. Advancements influenced health care in ways still felt today. Uniformed Women in the Great War Across from the Gen. Pershing landmark, a display examined the contribution of women to the war effort, from participation in preparedness activities before 1917 to serving in uniform. It highlighted how these women saw the uniform as a visible sign of their service that justified their call for full citizenship.The Nation We Build Together Highlights Report 2017 11 \u00a9201 8 National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution.

Posters were used to promote patriotism and appeal to the public's emotions, thereby inspiring action. The campaign was a powerful tool for shifting public sentiment toward support for American participation in the war. American History (After Hours): Women in World War I American History (After Hours) dedicated an evening to the women of WWI. A discussion and Q&A were followed by an interactive reception featuring objects out of storage and pre-Prohibition cocktails. Across the Smithsonian Objects and artwork from the Museum's collection were part of the exhibition Artist Soldiers: Artistic Expression in the First World War at the National Air and Space Museum. They represented artistic expression by professional artists recruited by the U.S. Army and front-line soldiers who created artwork during their war service. Visitors to World War I Handi-hour at the Renwick Gallery were able to recreate WWI laces and embroideries based on objects in the National Museum of American History's collections.Visitors are encountering something visually different at the Museum \u2014 and it's not just the exhibitions in 2 West. A walk through the halls offers a look at the beginning of a vibrant identity rollout with a contemporary feel that honors the Smithsonian's respected image. The logo cleverly draws inspiration from the Star-Spangled Banner, using a star as its main feature and jagged lines of typeface representative of the stripes and worn edges of the flag that once saw war. The shops offer updated merchandise showing off the modern look, and wayfinding signs as well as outdoor signage have a clean, eye-catching appeal. In 2018, the public will see the full depth of the identity and its range of clever messaging, colors and methods of incorporating objects and visitors into ads, programs, merchandise and graphics throughout the building. \"The level of examination by the designers and then insight into the Museum's mission and operations was wonderfully reassuring,\" said Elizabeth MacMillan Director John Gray. \"When they presented their concepts, we were all thrilled.\" The Museum thanks the following individuals for their dedication to the creation, strategy and account management of the new identity: board member John Adams, John Fulbrook, William Morrisey, Charles Watlington, Jason Nuttall, John Gibson, Andrew Augeri, Cara Watson and Julie Carroll.A New Identity for the Museum Above: Posters, designed by John A. Coughlin, 1917, \"Go over the top with U.S. Marines\"; by James Montgomery Flagg, around 1918, \"Sow the seeds of victory! Plant & raise your own vegetables\"; and by Clarence F. Underwood, around 1918, \"Back our girls over there\"12 National Museum of American HistoryWhen Fashion Marks History A vanilla silk crepe gown was the object of everyone's attention in October, during the first lady's donation of her inaugural dress. Melania Trump visited the Museum as part of a tradition more than a century old in which the nation's first lady provides a gown to the Smithsonian. For Mrs. Trump and designer Herv\u00e9 Pierre, who also attended, the gown holds a story of collaboration and fast-tracked creativity. \"We were very busy with all that goes into preparing for a new administration and all the changes that we, as a family, would be facing,\" said Mrs. Trump. \"To be honest, what I would wear to the inaugural ball was the last thing on my mind. In fact, by the time I got around to thinking about my wardrobe choice, poor Herv\u00e9 was only given two weeks to design and produce this couture piece.\" Mrs. Trump's off-the-shoulder gown, worn to the 2017 inaugural balls, now joins the Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection and is on display in the center of the Museum's popular exhibition The First Ladies. The design, including the ruffled accent trim from neckline to hem and a claret ribbon around the waist, was a collaborative effort between the first lady and the French American fashion and costume designer. For decades, the First Ladies Collection has been one of the most visited attractions at the Smithsonian. The original first ladies exhibition of 1914 was the first display at the Smithsonian to prominently feature women. Today's exhibition features 26 dresses and more than 160 other objects. \"Like the position of first lady, the exhibition has adapted,\" said Curator Lisa Kathleen Graddy, Division of Political History. \"It works to integrate the beloved traditional elements, the dresses and the White House china, with discussion of the changing roles of women and first ladies in America.\" Following the ceremony, the first lady, Pierre and guests joined curators as they swiftly, yet delicately, installed the gown into the exhibition. \"The Smithsonian has the unique honor and ability to freeze style and tell future generations the stories of our nation's history,\" said Mrs. Trump. \"I'm so honored and grateful to become part of this history.\" From left: Elizabeth MacMillan Director John Gray and Secretary David Skorton welcome First Lady Melania Trump; designer Herv\u00e9 Pierre receives warm applause from guests; the first lady addresses guests. Opposite: Mrs. Trump's inaugural gownIn October, First Lady Melania Trump officially donated her inaugural ball gown to the Museum, and it was subsequently added to the popular exhibition The First Ladies. Since the public expects to view this growing collection of inaugural dresses when visiting the Museum, they have continuously been on display for more than a century. Initially, in the early 1900s, the dresses were placed on mannequins made of a non-adjustable, one-size generic clay torso in glass exhibition cases that were not tightly sealed and were exposed to natural daylight. Consequently, many of the dresses became fragile, soiled and damaged, resulting in visible fading, sagging, wrinkling and dragging of the dresses on the floor. Recent advances in costume conservation have positively impacted display and preservation efforts, so that this important collection will be available for future generations. Since conservation work is a behind-the-scenes activity, most of the public is unaware of the scientific analyses and historical research required to prepare these pieces for exhibition. Preservation not only requires treatment of these fragile objects but also preparation of forms that interpret the accurate posture, stance and mannerisms of the period. Over time, the forms, mounting materials and the methods of display have improved as better knowledge and materials have become available. In retrospect, it is obvious that problems arose from what were once considered current display techniques. By observation of damage from previous mountings, by selecting improved archival materials, and through a better understanding of the body shape on which the costumes would have been worn, it is possible to create new forms with improved support, thereby limiting further damage. In addition, to achieve the best possible display and preservation of these dresses, collaboration and utilization of the expertise and knowledge from various fields throughout the Museum is critical. After all, it is truly a special opportunity to conserve these dresses that represent momentous times in these women's lives.Conserving Stitches of TimeCONSERVATOR'S PERSPECTIVE Sunae Park Evans Senior Costume Conservator, Preservation Services The Nation We Build Together Highlights Report 2017 13 82,000+ visitors from June 28-July 265,000+ visitors engaged in new programs in Wallace H.

The Nation We Build Together Highlights Report 2017 17 February 19, 2017, marked the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. The order resulted in the imprisonment of 75,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry and 45,000 Japanese immigrants. Roosevelt's original order could be viewed in Righting a Wrong: Japanese Americans and World War II for most of the exhibition run. The Museum depicts how this document, loaned by the National Archives, shaped the lives of Japanese Americans during the war and still resonates today. Searching for artifacts and documents across the country has been a fascinating journey, particularly meeting people with unique stories. Jane Oka, who spent her childhood in Poston incarceration camp with family, told me of her father, Sadao. He took a bird carving class in the camp and made many of the beautiful handmade pins on display. Jane has admired them, with various memories and emotions associated with the objects \u2014 from hardship and loss to healing and resolution. Her father's spirit lives in the birds. By donating them, she feels that her family's legacy is kept alive. It was important for us to offer different perspectives under a prism of shared experiences through powerful objects, many of which speak for themselves. Through artifacts such as artwork, school yearbooks and military uniforms, we capture moments in history. As the people who experience this history become older, we can ensure that their stories are preserved for future generations.Righting a WrongCURATORIAL PERSPECTIVE Noriko Sanefuji Museum Specialist, Division of Armed Forces History The Museum displayed the only Medal of Honor awarded to a combat photographer.

Funded by the Brewers Association, the not-for-profit trade association supporting independent craft brewers, the American Brewing History Initiative is a three-year project to collect and preserve the history of brewing in America. Brewing history is an engaging and effective lens through which to explore our nation's most important stories. Histories of immigration, urbanization, innovation, changing gender roles and more come to vibrant life when understood through beer. The Museum maintains rich holdings related to brewing technology and advertising a century ago. Yet we can benefit from thoughtful expansion into the more recent past. On nationwide research trips, I am collecting the stories of home brewers and craft beer, in particular. Initial travels have taken me to California and Colorado, and future trips to the Northwest, Midwest and New England await. Brewing history objects will appear in the Museum's refreshed FOOD exhibition, and recorded oral histories will soon be online, at the public's fingertips. I have been gratified to encounter intense excitement among the brewing community, scholars, the media and the public. I hear daily from Americans who tell of their grandfather who labored in the local brewery or their cousin who brews champion IPAs in her basement. Americans feel connected to the history of brewing, and they are thrilled it has found a home at the Smithsonian.Life Through the Lens of BeerHISTORIAN'S PERSPECTIVE Theresa McCulla Historian, Division of Work and Industry The Nation We Build Together Highlights Report 2017 23 The Smithsonian and the National Endowment for the Humanities presented the second annual History Film Forum, exploring how documentaries and feature films can teach and interpret history.

John Kress, Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History Looking Forward The red carpet was rolled out for much of 2017 at the National Museum of American History with the welcoming of a stunning array of special guests who have had a major impact on American culture. From Sting to the cast of The Walking Dead, these individuals participated in programs and donation ceremonies that shed light on different aspects of American entertainment, the theme behind the upcoming exhibition Entertaining America. Expected to open by 2020, Entertaining America will invite visitors to consider the powerful role entertainment \u2014 theater, music, sports, movies and broadcasting \u2014 has played and continues to play in American history and life. The 20-year exhibition will anchor the west wing's third floor. Last summer, iconic singer-songwriter Sting, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee with the Police and 16-time Grammy winner, joined three-time Oscar nominated composer, songwriter and social activist J. Ralph for a donation ceremony and discussion. A conversation about their musical and philanthropic contributions to American culture was followed by the world premiere of J. Ralph's symphonic piece Evolocean and a performance by Sting of The Empty Chair. Sting and J. Ralph recently teamed on the evocative song written for the documentary Jim: The James Foley Story, about the American photojournalist killed by ISIS. During the fall, the Museum honored Thomas J. Brokaw with a Great Americans award. The legendary television journalist, author, former NBC Nightly News anchor, and current NBC News special correspondent was interviewed by David M. Rubenstein, chair of the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents and a Museum board member. The evening included a conversation with Brokaw and an opportunity to collect artifacts representative of his distinguished career.

As a result, the Museum collected objects from Telemundo, one of the Spanish-language television networks in the country whose roots go back to the 1950s. The donation ceremony was part of the Museum's initiative, Escuchame: The History of Spanish-language Broadcasting in the U.S., which grew out of the American Enterprise exhibition. More than 40 current and past Telemundo employees contributed to the initiative, including Noticiero Telemundo anchor Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart, who attended the ceremony.

Standing proudly with their children before the floor's new changing gallery were Ambassador Nicholas F. and Mrs. Eugenia L. Taubman, for whom the space was named. Ambassador Taubman, the Museum's chairman, and his wife provided support throughout the west wing project, including a gift of $1.5 million toward the gallery. The space opened with Religion in Early America and will house a wide range of changing exhibitions that expand upon 2 West's theme. As focus shifts to the wing's third floor, the Taubmans pledged $5 million in 2017 toward the Nicholas F. and Eugenia Taubman Hall of Music, named in their honor. The stunning hall has begun to hold performances, as the home of the Smithsonian Chamber Music Society and Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra. The couple's support also endows cultural programming.Ambassador Nicholas F. and Mrs. Eugenia L. Taubman DONOR SPOTLIGHTFans of The Walking Dead were especially excited to learn about the Museum's recent acquisition of objects from AMC's post- apocalyptic television series. Cast members and AMC executives were on-site for a donation ceremony, which featured objects used and worn by characters over the past seven seasons, including the crossbow wielded by fan favorite Daryl Dixon. The items will further contribute to the understanding of the history of television as a shared audience experience, artistic content and a technological medium. Helping to wrap up an extraordinary year, the Museum welcomed artist and philanthropist John Legend, one of Smithsonian magazine's American Ingenuity Award winners. Legend discussed his childhood and early career steps, and shared how music now serves as a platform from which he can address issues most important to him. The Museum will increase cultural programming leading up to and after the opening of Entertaining America and will collect additional items representative of American entertainment. Select objects will be included in the new exhibition, part of the transformation of the third floor's west wing, opening in phases beginning in 2018. \"Entertainment is now arguably the primary experience that we share and hold in common as Americans,\" said Curator John Troutman, Division of Culture and the Arts. \"It brings people together, and it provides a forum for important national conversations about politics, society, culture and what it means to be an American.\"The Walking Dead cast member Norman Reedus. Below: John LegendThe streets of Paris served as the perfect classroom for an unforgettable behind-the-scenes exploration of the French-American alliance, from the American Revolution to the present, during the Director's Tour.
