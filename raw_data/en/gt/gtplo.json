Required by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70.95, this Plan will guide actions by King County, all cities in King County except Seattle and Milton, and private companies that provide curbside collection and processing of recyclable materials. This Plan addresses the many public and private components of the regional solid waste system, including: The King County Solid Waste Division's (divisiont) operation of the Cedar Hills regional landfill, ten transfer facilities, nine closed landfills, and many programs to prevent and recycle waste; City efforts to promote recycling and provide for curbside pick-up of materials, either as a direct city service or through contracts with private haulers; and Private companies'collection of materials at the curbside and operation of processing facilities that convert recyclable and organic materials into marketable products. Partnerships among system participants are key to the successful implementation of this Plan. ln 2018, the final city signed the Amended and Restated lnterlocal Agreement, securing participation of all 37 partner cities through 2040. This milestone reaffirms the county's responsibility to provide disposal through 2040, allows costs and risks to be shared across the large regional customer base, and strengthens opportunities to work together to achieve environmental goals. This Plan benefitted from extensive public input including nearly two years of collaboration between the division and its two advisory committees. The input helped the Plan address time-critical service choices facing the regional system: Recycling. Waste prevention and recycling are long-standing priorities. Much progress has been made through expanded recycling options and services, customer education, and other means. However the region's recycling percentage still hovers in the low 50s and stronger markets for recyclables are needed in light of factors such as China's recent import restrictions on recyclable materials. This Plan offers a variety of waste prevention and recycling approaches that allow system participants to tailor approaches to their jurisdiction's needs while working together to harmonize approaches to achieve better results for the region. Transfer.This Plan recommends the continued modernization of the transfer system. Station upgrades are completed or underway in all urban areas (except for Northeast King County) to improve services and meet future needs. This Plan recommends that the 1960s era Houghton station in Kirkland be replaced with a modern station so that equitable levels of service are available throughout the urban area including the fast- growing Northeast part of King County. Disposal. The Cedar Hills Regional Landfill has provided cost-effective, environmentally responsible waste disposal for more than 50 years. Built capacity at the landfill will be exhausted in 2028 however, leaving only ten years to put the next disposal method in place. To meet disposal needs, this Plan recommends further development of Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity, while affirming that garbage shall not be disposed of, nor shall soils be stockpiled, within 1,000 feet of the property line at the landfill, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. To account for technological advances, this Plan does not specify the next disposal method after ultimate closure of Cedar Hills. Evaluation of future disposal methods will begin before the next plan update. eotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 zotB Att A Page 15xvOrdinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Although many challenges lie ahead for the regional solid waste system, working together under this Plan, system participants can achieve more through collective effort that continues the region's commitment to customer-oriented environmentally responsible solid waste services. XVi zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management PIan Aptil 17,2019 ctl0n This Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (Plan) proposes strategies for managing King County's solid waste over the next six years, with consideration of the next 20 years. The Plan was prepared by the Solid Waste Division (the division) of the Department of Natural Resources (DNRP) and Parks in accordance with the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70.95 and in cooperation with its advisory committees - the Metropolitan Solid Waste Management Advisory Committee (MSWMAC) and the Solid Waste Advisory Committee (SWAC). MSWMAC represents the 37 cities in King County that are signatories to the Amended and Restated lnterlocal Agreement (Amended and Restated ILA), the foundation of the King County solid waste system.This Plan revises the 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (2001 Plan), and builds upon the 2006 Tronsfer and Waste Management Plan (Transfer Plan). With this Plan, the division embraces the DNRP's mission to foster sustainable and livable communities by focusing on these critical areas: environmental quality, equity and socialjustice, fiscal responsibility, and economic vitality. The division is building upon past and current efforts to increase waste prevention and recycling while advancing green building practices in the region's communities and within its own operations.The division continues to refine operational practices and facility designs in ways that further reduce its carbon footprint and promote the greening of natural and built environments. The participants in the countywide solid waste management system - from the 37 cities within the county's borders to the private-sector collection and processing companies to individual businesses and residents - are contributing to these vital efforts in their own operations and practices. zotg Conprehensiue Solid Wste Management 18893 Ljoclaled Aoril 17 2O19 Since its inception in 1969, the core mission of the division has been to ensure that residents and businesses in the county have access to safe, reliable, efficient, and affordable solid waste handling and disposal services. The last few decades have brought about significant developments in the management of solid waste, stemming not onlyfrom advances in technology and the changing marketplace, but from a widespread recognition of the importance of waste prevention, resource conservation, sustainable development and environmental stewardship. Over time, the management of solid waste has evolved from a relatively simple system of garbage collection and disposal to a much more complex network of collection, transportation, and processing for garbage, recyclables, organics (yard waste and food scraps), and construction and demolition debris.This integrated network combines the infrastructure and services of both the public and private sectors to provide long-term capacity for solid waste management in the region. Summary of the Plan Organization This Plan is organized to guide the reader through the major elements of the solid waste system. Within each chapter are elements as described below: Goals reflect the long-term outcomes and aspirations for the regional system. Goals should not change through the life of the Plan. Policies provide broad direction and authorization for services and system priorities. Policies should not change through the life of the Plan. Actions are targeted, specific, and time-based to implement policies and could include: programs, studies, infrastructure improvements, and regulations. Actions are built on a foundation of daily service delivery by the county, cities, and other stakeholders.

An interlocal agreement is required for any city participating in a joint city-county plan (RCW 70.95.080(3)). This Plan was prepared in cooperation with 37 King County cities with which the county has interlocal agreements (all cities in the county except for Seattle and Milton). This Plan builds upon the 2001 Plan and the Transfer Plan that was approved by the King County Council in December 2007. This Plan presents goals, policies, and actions in the following areas: the existing solid waste system, forecasting and data, sustainable materials management, the transfer and processing system, landfill management and solid waste disposal, and system financing. On January 8, 2018, the Draft Plan and Draft Environmental lmpact Statement (ElS), conducted according to the State Environmental Policy Act, were released for a 60-day public comment period.The public comment period ended on March 8, 2018. The division received 68 comment letters from 40 individuals, four organizations, five businesses, four agencies, one King County Councilmember and 14 cities. During the comment period, the division also held three open houses and participated in13 stakeholder meetings with varied audiences. ln addition, the division employed a variety of communications tools in the public awareness campaign during the 60-day public review and comment period. These included on-line and in-person opportunities to comment, as well as printed materials, a cableTV spot, press releases, and a PowerPoint presentation to support presentations to stakeholders to make people aware of the key topics in the Draft Plan and how they could comment. Key messages were developed early and were used in all awareness efforts. An on-line tool was also used to offer people a way to voice their opinions on the three key issues in the Draft Plan. A total of 487 respondents (486 in English, one in Spanish) participated in the informal on-line questionnaire (KCSWD 2018a). The revised Plan, transmitted to the King County Council in July 2018, considers comments, preliminary review by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), review by the UTC and the Washington State Department of Agriculture, and incorporates the Executive's recommendations.The revised Plan must be adopted by: The King County Council, . The Regional Policy Committee acting as the Solid Waste Interlocal Forum (SWIF), and . Cities representing three-quarters of the total population of the cities that act on the plan during a 1 20-day adoption period. After adoption and completion of the Final E15 the County/City-Approved Plan will be submitted to Ecology. The Plan becomes final upon Ecology's approval.

Att A Page 24Ordinance 18893 eExistirg Solid Wb\"ste SystemUpdated April 17 ,2019 Sign at Bow Lake Transfer Station encourages customers to recycle moreThe solid waste management system has evolved from a relatively basic system of garbage collection and disposalto a much more complex network of collection, sorting, salvage, reuse, recycling, composting, and disposal managed by the county, area cities, and private-sector collection and processing companies. lnitial improvements to solid waste facilities and operations have been developed further to incorporate waste prevention and recycling programs that strive to balance resource use and conservation with production and consumption. One of the early influences in the evolution of the system was the sweeping environmental legislation of the 1960s and 1970s, beginning in 1965 with the federal Solid Waste Management Act, which established strict regulatory standards for landfills and other solid waste facilities. Washington State subsequently passed its own waste management act, codified in Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70.95, and established Minimum Functional Standards for Solid Waste Handling in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 1 73-304.|n 1976, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act set even more stringent standards for environmental protection, including requirements for the use of impermeable bottom liners and daily cover at landfills. ln response to the more stringent regulations, the county began closing the unlined community landfills across the region, replacing many of them with the more environmentally protective and geographically dispersed transfer facilities that are still in operation today, With the development of the transfer network (eight transfer stations and two drop boxes) and technological advances at the county-owned Cedar Hills Regional Landfill (Cedar Hills), division facilities and operations were brought into compliance with the new environmental standards, and a safe, efficient, and sustainable system of solid waste management was created. The standards have continued to evolve over time, and transfer facllities and landfills now operate in accordance with the Solid Waste Handling Standards (WAC 173-350) and Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (WAC 173-351). Thirty-seven of the 39 cities in King County (all but the cities of Seattle and Milton) and the unincorporated areas of King County participate in the solid waste system. ln all, the county's service area, shown in Figure 2-1, covers approximately 2,050 square miles. ln 2017,lhere were almost 1.5 million residents and about 771,000 people employed in the service area, disposing over 931,000 tons of garbage at Cedar Hills. Studies show that even more can be done to reduce disposal through waste prevention, reuse, and recycling.l. lll:i.,1 - 9n4 26Ordinance 18893 Updated Aotil17,2019 The Solid Waste System Figure2-2 provides a general overview of the collection, transfer, transportation, processing, and disposal systems for garbage, recyclables, organics, and construction and demolition debris. Garbage is transported to Cedar Hills for disposal, while recyclables, organics, and most construction and demolition materials are taken directly to processing or compost facilities where materials are prepared for sale to manufacturers and other users. As shown, these recycled or composted products eventually return to the market for consumer purchase. As can be seen in Figure2-2, this multi-faceted system uses the combined resources of the public and private sectors. Regulations and systems for collection, transfer, transport, processing, and disposal that come into play are complex, involving state, count, city, and private-sector responsibilities. Collection of Solid Waste and Recyclables ln accordance with state law RCW 81.77.020 and 36.58.040, counties are prohibited from providing curbside garbage collection services. Legal authority for regulating collection is shared primarily between the state - acting through the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) - and the cities. The UTC sets and adjusts rates and requires compliance with the state and local adopted solid waste management plans and related ordinances. RCW 81.77 also includes a process for allowing cities to opt out of the UTC regulatory structure and either contract directly for solid waste collection or provide city-operated collection systems. The county's 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (2001 Plan) specifies that recycling should be included as part of the basic garbage rate for residents in most of King County. King County enacted a service-level ordinance (King County Code (KCC) 10.18) that includes this requirement for unincorporated areas, exceptVashon lsland, Skykomish, and Snoqualmie Pass.The UTC then required collection companies to develop tariffs that spread the cost and availability of recycling to all residential garbage customers. These tariffs and service-level requirements also apply to cities that have not opted out of the UTC regulatory structure. Most of the garbage, recyclables, and organics collection in the county's service area are provided by four private-sector companies - Recology CleanScapes, lnc., Republic Services, lnc. (formerly Allied Waste, lnc.), Waste Connections, lnc., and Waste Management, lnc. Except for Recology CleanScapes, which only provides contracted services, these companies operate both through the UTC and service contracts with individual cities. Most of the 37 cities in the service area contract directly with one or more Most of the garbage, recyclables, and of these private companies for collection services. Eight cities (Beaux Arts, organics col[ctiori is provided by Black Diamond, covington, Hunts Point, Kenmore, Medina, woodinville, the private sector (Photo courtesy of and Yarrow Point) and all of the unincorporated areas receive collection Recology Cleanscapes) services from these private companies operating under certificates issued by the UTC. Two cities - Enumclaw and Skykomish - provide municipal collection services within their own jurisdictions. Enumclaw collects garbage, recyclables, and organics; Skykomish collects only garbage. There is a fundamental difference in how the UTC regulates residential and non-residential collection of recyclable materials.The Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 prohibits regulation of price, route, or service zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan -Ju$ zotS 272-3Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Figure 2-2.The Solid Waste System ffi Garbage I Construction & Demolition Debrisil Recyclables WOrganics (c&D) Man New Global, Local Ma Private Materials Recovery Facilities & Recyclables Facilities zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste _ Att A Page 28Homes & Apartments Businesses Construction Sites Small Scale Organics Processing Bio EnergyWACou PrivatePrivate Composting Facility rer of ucts Cedar Hills Regional Landfill Private Landfill&& Processing Facility Transfer StationPrivateOrdinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 of any motor carrier transporting property. While this provision does not apply to collection of garbage and recyclable materials from residents, recyclable materials generated by the non-residential sector are considered to be property and are subject to a different regulatory structure. King County cannot enact ordinances that require commercial garbage collectors to include recyclables collection as part of the non-residential collection service. Cities, on the other hand, may include recyclables collection as part of their non-residential collection service, but cannot prohibit businesses and other non-residential entities from choosing other vendors for this service. Revenue Sharing Provides lncentive for Collection Companies to Enhance Recycling ln 2010, the state legislature amended statute RCW 81.77.185, allowing solid waste collection companies regulated by the UTC to retain up to 50 percent of the revenue paid to them for the recycled materials they collect from households (the statute does not apply to collection in cities with contracts for recyclables collection). The purpose of the statute is to provide collection companies with a financial incentive to enhance their recycling programs. Formerly, all revenues from the sale of residential recyclables were passed back to the households as a credit on their garbage bills. To qualify for the revenue sharing, collection companies must submit a plan to the UTC that has been certified by King County as consistent with the current Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan. The Solid Waste Division Director has authority to make this certification. To qualify for certification, the collection company's plan must: . Be submitted annually for approval, . Demonstrate how proposed program enhancements will be effective in increasing the quantity and quality of materials collected, . Demonstrate consistency with the minirnum collection standards, . lncorporate input from the Solid Waste Division, and . Be submitted to the Solid Waste Division with sufficient time to review prior to UTC deadlines. Since January 201 3, all UTC-regulated areas of King County, except Vashon lsland, have certified revenue sharing agreements in place. Curbside Collection in Rural Areas When curbside recycling was initiated in King County in the early 'l 990s, the collection companies (operating under UTC certificates) serving unincorporated areas were required to provide curbside recycling services as specified in KCC 10.18 for most of the county. These requirements, consistent with the 1989 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management P/an, stated that curbside recycling would be offered to all households as part of the basic garbage service and that yard waste service would be available to all households as a subscription service. However, some rural areas were exempted from these requirements because their low population density or lack of participation in garbage collection services suggested that curbside recycling might not be cost effective. Currently, three unincorporated areas are not included in the county's collection service-level standards as specified in KCC 10.18: zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Management Plan 292-5Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Vashon/Maury lsland - Historically, a comparatively high percentage of Vashon/Maury lsland residents have chosen to self-haul garbage and recyclables to the division's Vashon Recycling and Transfer Station; however, the number of households subscribing to garbage service has increased over time. Waste Connections, lnc., the company providing garbage collection service on Vashon/Maury lsland, also offers subscriptions to recyclables collection services. From a survey of lsland residents (KCSWD 2016c), about I7 percent currently subscribe to curbside recycling services. Organics curbside collection is not available. Skykomish Area - The area around Skykomish is remote and sparsely populated. Residents of Skykomish and some residents in surrounding unincorporated areas receive curbside garbage collection service from the Town of Skykomish. Skykomish does not collect curbside recyclables or organics. Customers may self-haul garbage and recyclables to the division's drop box facility located in Skykomish; however, separate organics collection is not provided at the facility. Snoqualmie Pass - The Snoqualmie Pass area is also very sparsely populated. Residential garbage collection is available from Waste Management, lnc. of Ellensburg in Kittitas County. Curbside recycling is not available; however; the division does provide a site with collection bins for the standard curbside recyclable materials. Organics collection is not available. Transfer The division operates eight transfer stations and two rural drop boxes in the urban and rural areas of the county (Figure 2-3). ln addition to meeting standards for the safe and environmentally sound transfer of solid waste, the transfer network reduces the amount of truck traffic on the highways by providing geographically dispersed stations where garbage collected throughout the region can be consolidated into fewer loads for transport to the landfill. Transfer facilities are the public face of the solid waste system. ln 2017, county transfer facilities received about 917,650tonsof garbageand recyclables,through morethan 952,360 customervisits. Garbage and, at most facilities, recyclable materials from business and residential self-haulers are accepted at the transfer station and drop box facilities. The transfer stations also provide accessible drop-off locations for garbage picked up at the curb by the commercial collection companies. From these geographically dispersed transfer stations, garbage is consolidated in transfer trailers and taken to the county-owned Cedar Hills Regional Landfill in the Maple Valley area. Recyclable materials are transported to processing facilities throughout the region. Public Health - Seattle & King County (Public Health) is the primary regulatory and enforcement agency responsible for issuing operating permits for both public and private solid waste handling facilities. This includes solid waste, recycling, and composting facilities.

Public Health inspects solid waste handling facilities and has the authority to take corrective action for noncompliance. Processing of Commingled Recyclables While garbage picked up at the curb goes to the county's solid waste system, the collection companies take the recyclable materials picked up at the curb to their own facilities for processing. The processing of recyclable materials into new commodities begins at a materials recovery facility. Materials recovery facilities receive material loads from collection trucks, remove contaminants from the loads, sort materials to meet the specifications of the end users or markets, and compact or bale the material for efficient shipping. As the residential collection system has moved to commingled collection, materials recovery facilities in the region have upgraded their facilities to improve their ability to remove contaminants and sort materials into marketable commodity grades. Any residuals, or non-recyclable waste products, from materials recovery facilities within the King County service area must be disposed of at a King County solid waste facility. The processing of recyclables throughout the Pacific Northwest is currently handled through the private sector. Companies that col lect recyclables curbside are required by contract or ordinance to deliver them to recycling facilities. Local facilities receive recyclable materials from the region as well as from other areas ofthe United States.These Recology Cleanscapes rnaterials recovery facility private-sector facilities have made necessary upgrades over time to expand processing capacity to meet demand. The three largest collection companies in King County - Recology CleanScapes lnc., Republic Services, lnc., and Waste Management lnc., each own a materials recovery facility located within the county, shown in Figure 2-4, to process most of the recyclable materials they collect. Recology CleanScapes'materials recovery facility in south Seattle opened in2014. Republic's 3rd and Lander Recycling Center in south Seattle was substantially redesigned in 2007 to improve its ability to sort commingled materials and in 2008 was upgraded to expand capacity. Waste Management's Cascade Recycling Center in Woodinville opened in 2002 and was recently upgraded with a new sort line. Curbside recyclables collected on Vashon lsland are processed at Waste Management JMK Fibers'Port of Tacoma facility, which was upgraded substantially in 201 3. Table 2-1 shows the address for each facility as well as how many tons were processed in 2017. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufi Page 32Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Figure 2-4.

Disposa I Solid waste generated in King County's service area is disposed at the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill - the only active landfill in the county. Located on a 920-acre site in the Maple Valley area, Cedar Hills has provided safe and efficient disposal of the county's solid waste since 1965. ln 2017, the landfill received over 931,000 tons of municipal solid waste. Cedar Hills was originally permitted in 1960, at a time when there were few regulations in place to govern the design and operation of landfills. Since then, environmental regulations have become increasingly rigorous, requiring the placement of an impermeable high-density polyethylene liner and clay barrier at the bottom of the f andfill, daily cover (using soil or other approved materials) over the waste, and frequent environmental monitoring, among other requirements. Over time, Cedar Hills has been developed in sequential stages (or refuse areas) in accordance with the most current Site Development Plan. The division has invested considerable effort and resources to upgrade older areas of the landfill, while designing and operating new areas to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. Figure 2-5 shows the layout of the landfill, including the boundaries of the past and active refuse areas as currently permitted. As shown, Area 7 is the currently active refuse area, and is expected to operate through 201 8 or early 201 9. At that time, operations willtransition to the newest refuse area, Area 8.A bulldozer compacts waste at the Cedar Hills landfill The landfill is bordered to the east by Passage Point, a transitional housing development, residentially zoned property on the east, north, and west, and by property to the south that is zoned for mining, other resource extraction, and similar uses. State regulation WAC 'l 73-351-140(3Xb) requires a 250-foot buffer between the active area and residentially zoned property, and a 1OO-foot buffer between the active area and non-residentially zoned property.

Cr-rrrent layout I\\l[t:t Page 352-11Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 However, a special permit, approved by the King County Board of Commissioners in 1960, specified that a 1,000-foot buffer be established around the landfill. ln the 1960s, landfilling inadvertently extended about 400 feet into a portion of the southeast buffer, but environmental regulations continue to be met in that area and opportunities to restore the buffer are being pursued. Active use of this buffer zone is currently limited to site access and other approved uses not directly related to land-filling operations, such as environmental monitoring and activities at Passage Point. The landfill has received national recognition for its operations and environmental control systems, which meet or exceed the highest federal, state, and local standards for protection of public health and the environment. This complex network of environmental controls includes a collection of pipes, culverts, holding ponds, and other equipment to manage water and landfill gas, as described in more detail below. Water at the landfill is separated into two categories for treatment. These are: 1) clean stormwater, and 2) contaminated stormwater, which includes leachate and other water that has potentially come into contact with garbage. Leachate is produced when water percolates through the garbage; it is collected in pipes within the landfill and diverted to lined on-site ponds. ln the ponds, the leachate is aerated as a preliminary treatment before being sent to the King County South Wastewater Treatment Plant in Renton. The bottom liner and clay barrier beneath the landfill prevent leachate from seeping into the soil or groundwater. Stormwater that runs off the surface of active landfill areas is also potentially contaminated. lt is collected in lined ponds before moving on to the treatment system. Clean stormwater is diverted to detention or siltation ponds to control flow and remove sediment, and is then discharged to surface water off-site. Landfill gas is generated through the decomposition of waste buried in the landfill. The gas consists of about 50 percent to 60 percent methane, with the remainder made up of carbon dioxide and trace amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases. Landfill gas from Cedar Hills is collected by using motor blowers to create a vacuum in Figure 2-6. Landfill gas-to-energy process Gedar Hills Regional Landfill BEW Public 2,550 tons of trash come into the landfill on average each day.The decomposing organic materiai forms carbon dioxide and methane gases. ln 20lZ the landfill generated about 10,000 cubic feet per minute of gas.

The gas used to be routed to high-temperature flares, where it was burned to safely destroy any harmful emissions. ln a public/private partnership, Bio Energy Washington, began operating a landfill gas-to-energy facility at the landfill in 2010. The facility runs landfill gas through a series of processors that remove and destroy harmful components and convert the methane portion of the gas into pipeline-quality natural gas, The clean gas is routed through a nearby gas line into the Puget Sound Energy grid and is also used to power the facility (Figure 2-6). The division is also exploring other uses for the gas, such as producing compressed natural gas for operating vehicles. The flare system is kept in standby mode; during maintenance of the energy facility or in the event of an emergency, the flare system can be activated to manage the gas. Air emissions from the flare system are tested regularly and have consistently met or exceeded all applicable environmental regulations. Solid Waste System Planning ln addition to regulating solid waste handling and disposal, state law also established a framework for planning, authorizing counties to prepare coordinated Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plans in cooperation with the cities within their borders. While cities can choose to prepare their own plans, all of the incorporated cities within King County, except for Seattle and Milton, have chosen to participate in the development of this single, coordinated regional plan for the incorporated and unincorporated areas of King County. Since July, 1988, cities have entered into interlocal agreements (lLAs) with the county that establish the Solid Waste Division as the lead planning agency. By the time the first Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan was adopted by the Metropolitan King County Council in 1990, there were 29 incorporated cities participating in this coordinated effort. Since then, eight new cities have incorporated and joined the King County system - for a total of 37 cities. To make sound planning decisions, it is important to understand how the solid waste system operates today and to identify changes that might affect it in the future. This information is critical to ensuring that plans for facilities, services, and programs meet the needs of the region in the years to come. Because the system is a combination of public and private entities, working with stakeholders in the early stages of system planning is essential. ln addition to working with localjurisdictions and the private-sector collection companies, the division works closely with its two advisory committees - the 5olid Waste Advisory Committee (SWAC) and the Metropolitan Solid Waste Management Advisory Committee (MSWMAC). For the preparation of this Plan, the division collaborated with the advisory committees through a process of presentations and discussions. The next section identifies the participants in the planning process and describes the stakeholder process that guided the development of this plan. Also included is a brief description of the state, county, and city responsibilities in planning the solid waste system. A Regional Approach As partners in a regional system, cities share in the costs and benefits of King County's transfer and disposal system. The regional solid waste system was formally established in King County when the county and cities entered into the original Solid Waste lnterlocal Agreement of 1988. ln 2013, the county worked with the cities to amend the original lLA. The Amended and Restated Solid Waste lnterlocal Agreement (Amended and Restated ILA) extends the original ILA by 1 2.5 years, from June 2028 through December 2040 (the full text of the ILA can be found in Appendix C). The longer term will keep rates lower by allowing for longer-term bonding for capital projects. All 37 cities have signed the Amended and Restated lLA. Cities in the regional system are on the following page: zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management 372-13Ordinance 18893 Uodated Aoril Burien Carnation Hill CovingtonDes Enumclaw Point lssaquah Kenmore Kent Kirkland Lake Forest ParkMaple Valley Medina Mercer lsland Newcastle Normandy Park North Bend Pacific Redmond Renton SammamishSea Tac Shoreline Skykomish Snoqualmie Tukwila Woodinville Yarrow Point The Amended and Restated ILA includes several enhancements to the original lLA, including provisions for insurance and a potential reserve for environmental liabilities. Other changes include: . Commitment to the continued involvement of the cities advisory group (to be renamed the Metropolitan Solid Waste Advisory Committee or MSWAC), . An expanded role for cities in system planning, including planning for long-term disposal alternatives and in establishing fi nancial policies, . A dispute resolution process, which includes non-binding mediation, and . Mitigation provisions for host cities and neighboring cities. lssues specific to individualjurisdictions, such as the city of Bothell annexing areas in Snohomish County, may require an amendment to the ILA that addresses that particular concern. Both the original and the new ILA assign responsibility for different aspects of solid waste management to the county and the cities. The county is assigned operating authority for transfer and disposal services, is tasked with providing support and assistance to the cities for the establishment of waste prevention and recycling programs, and is the planning authority for solid waste. Each city is designated the authority for collection services within its corporate boundaries and agrees to direct solid waste generated and/or collected within those boundaries to the King County transfer and disposal system. Cooperation between the county and the 37 cities in a regional system of solid waste management has allowed the division to achieve economies of scale that translate into lower fees for system ratepayers. A significant benefit is the savings realized by being able to extend the life of the in-county landfill for solid waste disposal as a result of improved recycling rates. Economies of scale will continue to be beneficial once the Cedar Hills landfill reaches capacity and closes, and the region transitions to a new method of solid waste disposal. The benefits also extend to the network of recycling and transfer stations that provide convenient, geographically dispersed transfer points around the county. A regional system can operate with fewer transfer facilities than an aggregation of separate, smaller systems. The regional system also allows use of individual stations to be balanced to reduce over- or under- use of any one station. Examples of ways the division may influence station use are: 1) reader boards located at each transfer station that show what the wait times are at the two nearest stations and 2) the online information available for each station showing a picture of the inbound queue and the average disposal time after weigh-in at each station. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Regional Authorities and Roles As defined in RCW 70.95.030, solid waste handling includes management, storage, collection, transportation, treatment, utilization, processing, and final disposal. Responsibility for solid waste handling in Washington is divided among the state, counties, jurisdictional health departments, and the cities, as delineated in various legislation, regulations, and agreements. Table 2-2 lists the responsibilities for each entity, its role, and the guiding legislation. As shown in the table, the state establishes authorities, minimum standards, and planning requirements, and delegates responsibility for implementation to the counties and cities. Table 2-2.

Stakeholder lnvolvement in the Planning Process ln the development of the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan, the division sought participation and input from many sources, including the cities, the division's advisory committees, the Community Service Areas (unincorporated area community councils), commercial collection companies, the County Council, division employees, labor unions, and the public. ln 2004, the Metropolitan King County Council adopted Ordinance 14971 to establish a process for the 37 cities in the county's service area to collaborate with the division in the early stages of long-term planning and policy development. lt set the stage for creation of MSWMAC, which consists of elected officials and staff from participating cities. MSWMAC and the long-standing SWAC, mandated by RCW 70.95J65, have been instrumental in the development of policies, goals, and recommendations presented in this Plan. SWAC has been an advisory group to the division since 1985, with a membership that is geographically balanced and includes King County residents and representatives from public interest groups, labor unions, recycling businesses, the marketing sector, agriculture, manufacturing, the waste management industry, and local elected officials. Both SWAC and MSWMAC have been working with the division to create the A joint meeting of the MSWMAC and SWAC committees zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jul1 zotS Att A Page 412-17Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17 .2019 building blocks that form the basis for this Plan. Collaborative efforts that have helped shape the Plan include: . Establishing progressive goals for waste prevention and recycling that will further reduce solid waste disposal, . Conducting in-depth analyses and evaluations of the solid waste transfer system that resulted in the development and adoption of a major renovation and replacement plan for the transfer system network, . Conducting subsequent in-depth reviews of the renovation and replacement plan for the transfer network, and . Evaluating strategies for extending the life of Cedar Hills and beginning to explore viable options for waste disposal once the landfill closes. For the current planning cycle, the division met with SWAC and MSWMAC regularly to discuss their issues and concerns, and heartheir perspectives on system planning.The contributions of these committees have been instrumental in developing the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan.The division's SWAC and MSWMAC websites contain background on the committees as well as minutes from their meetings with the division (http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/dnrp/solid-waste/about/advisory-committees,aspx). Trends in Solid Waste Management Leading the Way in Waste Prevention, Recycling and Product Stewardship King County continues to gain distinction as a leader in waste prevention and recycling. Together, the division and the cities work with collection and processing companies and local, state, and national businesses and organizations to develop the innovative programs and services that give the county its leading edge. Some key program developments include: . The addition of acceptable recyclable materials for collection at the curb and at division transfer stations, . Growing markets for a wider array of materials for recycling and reuse, . Successful promotions that encourage waste prevention, . An increase in product stewardship, including optimizing/reducing product packaging and shipping materials, whereby manufacturers and retailers are assuming responsibility for recycling their products through take-back , programs at selected collection sites across the region, . Advances in the green building industry, including a focus on creating sustainable housing in affordable communities, and . An increase in the number of organizations that accept materials for reuse, such as clothing and textiles, edible food, and reusable building materials. With this Plan, the division and its advisory committees set goals to reduce, reuse, and recycle by focusing on specific waste generators and particular materials or products that remain prevalent in the waste stream. The division is also moving toward a sustainable materials management approach as a way to strengthen the economy while reducing the climate effects of materials and harm to the environment. This approach emphasizes the importance of looking at the full life cycle of materials: design and manufacture, use, and end-of-life. Sustainable materials management is being promoted by both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington State Department of Ecology and is discussed in more depth in Chapter 4. Solid Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 zotS 2-18 zotg April 17,2019 Washington's legislated system for managing unwanted electronic products and mercury-containing light bulbs and tubes illustrates the successes that can be achieved when manufacturers, retailers, local governments, and nonprofit organizations work together on a major initiative. State legislation was passed in 2006 that requires manufacturers of computers, monitors, and televisions - referred to as e-waste - to provide for the recycling of these products beginning in January 2009. As a member of the Northwest Product Stewardship Council, the division helped draft the model legislation that led to formation of the E-Cycle Washington program, which implements this recycling service at no cost for Washington residents, small businesses, small governments, nonprofit organizations, and school districts.The division assisted businesses throughout the county to become authorized e-waste collection sites. Approximately 175,000 tons of e-waste have been collected since the program's inception. Likewise, the LightRecycle WA program, which recycles mercury-containing lights, went into effect in 20'l 5. Expanding the Collection of Recyclable and Degradable Materials A change in the collection of curbside recyclables has been the transition to commingled (or single-stream) collection. With this system, all recyclables can be placed in a single, wheeled cart rather than the smaller, separate bins often used in the past. The single cart system not only makes recycling easier and more convenient for the customer, it is more efficient for the companies that provide collection service. ln addition, the division and cities have worked with the commercial collection companies to implement curbside collection of food scraps and food-soiled paper in the yard waste (organics) container. About 99 percent of single- family customers with curbside garbage collection have access to organics (yard waste and food scraps) collection service. Only Vashon lsland and the Skykomish and Snoqualmie Pass areas, which house less than one percent of the county's residents, do not have this service. Studies estimate that over 50 percent of those who set out organics carts recycle some of their food scraps. The combined food scraps and yard waste are taken to processing facilities that turn the materials into nutrient-rich compost used to enrich soils. Building a New Generation of Transfer Stations Solar panels orr the south roof of the Shoreline Recyclirrg and Transfer Station, one of the many green features of ther buildingSince the approval by the King County Council in2007 of the So/ld WasteTransfer and Waste Management Plan (Transfer Plan), the division has been moving forward on the renovation and replacement of the division's urban transfer stations to update technology, incorporate green building features, increase recycling services, and achieve operational effi ciencies. New recycling and transfer stations include a flat tipping floor, areas for the collection of a wide array of recyclables, design features that reduce water and energy use, and solid waste compactors. By compacting garbage prior to transport for disposal, up to 30 percent fewer truck trips are required to haul the same amount of garbage, zotg Conzprehensiue Solid Waste Manag;etnent Platt 18893 Updated 17.2019 2008, the division opened the first offive new state-of-the-art transfer stations - the Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Station. The station has exceeded all expectations for environmental excellence with its innovative design and green building features. lt received the highest possible honor from the U.5. Green Building Council with a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design'\" (LEED') Platinum certification. The station has also been the recipient of 15 recognition awards from national, regional, and local organizations, including the Solid Waste Association of North America, the American lnstitute of Architects, the American Public Works Association, and the Northwest Construction Consumer Council. Public involvement was a crucial component of the successful design and construction of the Shoreline station. Throughout the process, the division worked closely with the City of Shoreline, neighboring communities, environmental groups, and local businesses and citizens to obtain their input on the project. The facility design and public process for the Shoreline station have set the bar high for the other recycling and transfer stations approved for construction during this planning period, reflecting: . How to approach the planning process - incorporating early community involvement, . How to build them - using the greenest elements possible, and . How to operate them - pursuing operational efficiencies that reduce fuel, energy, and water use; and increasing recycling opportu nities. Following the success of the Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Station, construction began on the new Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Station. The design of the new Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Station builds upon the environmental achievements of Shoreline, with compactors for improved efficiency, water re-use, energy efficient lighting, and solar panels. Providing capacity for about one third of the system's garbage, Bow Lake also offers expanded recycling opportunities. The new recycling and transfer station was completed in 2013 and also earned a Platinum LEED' certification, as well as other awards of excellence. The most recent station to be completed, the Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station - opened in late 201 7. This same year, a site was selected for the South County Recycling and Transfer Station (SCRTS) after completion of a Final Environmental lmpact Statement. The selected site is just north of the existing station. Design and construction of the station will take place over the next several years, with an anticipated station opening in2022. All new recycling and transfer stations will meet green building, safety and environmental standards; accommodate projected growth ln the region; incorporate best practices in transfer and transport operations; and offer a wide variety of recycling opportunities for residential and business customers. The new Factoria Recycling and Transfer Statlon opened in late Managetnent 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Managing Solid Waste Disposal with an Eye to the Future Cedar Hills is the only landfill still operating in King County. Because use of the county landfill is currently the most economical method for disposal of the region's wastes, the division has been extending its useful life.This strategy, recommended in the Transfer Plan, was approved by the County Council in 2007.1n December 2010, the County Council approved a Project Program Plan enabling the division to move forward with further development of Cedar Hills. As approved in the Project Program Plan, a disposal area covering approximately 56,5 acres is being developed - this will extend the life of the landfillto about 2028 depending on a variety of factors, including tonnage received. The 2001 Plan directed the division to'tontract for long-term disposal at an out-of-county landfill once Cedar Hills reaches capacity and closes.\" With this Plan, the division explored a range of options for future disposal. The Plan's recommendation is to further develop Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity. The next disposal method to employ after Cedar Hills reaches capacity is not specifed in this Plan, so that the latest technological advances can be considered. Emerging technologies for converting solid waste to energy or other resources, such as fuels, are in various stages of development and testing in U.5. and international markets. Some of the technologies are capable of processing the entire solid waste stream, while others target specific components, such as plastics or organics. Regardless of which long term disposal option is selected, the transfer system will still be needed to efficiently consolidate loads. The division will continue to monitor emerging technologies and advances in established disposal methods, recycling, and waste prevention. Although the Amended and Restated lnterlocal Agreement requires consultation with cities at least seven years before Cedar Hills closes, evaluation of the next disposal method should begin prior to the next plan update to ensure enough time for method selection, planning, and implementation. Financing the Solid Waste System for the Long Term As the division continues to modernize the transfer system, keeping fees as low and stable as possible is a funda mental objective. While division revenues rely primarily on per-ton fees for garbage disposal, the current priorities are to increase recycling and prevent waste generation. Reductions in tonnage due to waste prevention and recycling have been gradual, and the system has adjusted accordingly. However, further reductions will continue to affect system revenues. The division will continue to identify new revenue sources, such as the sale of landfill gas from the Cedar Hills landfill and greenhouse gas offsets from this and other potential sources, and will explore sustainable financing options. The division will also work with its advisory committees and others to develop and/or revise financial policies, and address rate stabilization and cost containment. Policies, actions and more discussion can be found in Chapter 7, Solid Waste System Finance. Protecting Natural Resources through Environmental Stewardship Environmental stewardship means managing natural resources so they are available for future generations. lt also involves taking responsibility - as individuals, employees, business owners, manufacturers, and governments - for the protection of public health and the environment. Building an environmentally sustainable solid waste management system in King County takes a coordinated, region- wide effort. The division, the cities, and the collection and processing companies in the region are making concerted efforts to help make this happen. zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Managemenl Plan 452-21Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Waste prevention and recycling are just two of the ways in which the division and others are working to reduce wastes, conserve resources, and protect the environment. Other innovations and well- established programs that support environmental stewardship include collecting and selling landfill gas to be converted to pipeline quality gas, potential new composting and reuse facilities, and providing cleanup assistance for illegal dumping.The division provides cleanup assistance for illegal dumping Additional Planning Considerations Climate Change Climate impacts are considered by the division when planning for future programs, facilities, and operations, in accordance with Washington State's Solid and Hazardous Waste Plan, Moving Washington Beyond Waste and Toxics (Ecology 2015) and the county's StrategicClimate Action Plan (King County 2015b). Climate change is manifest in the long-term trends in average weather patterns, including the frequency, duration, and intensity of wind and snow storms, cold weather and heat waves, and drought and flooding. Climate change is attributed primarily to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), including such compounds as carbon dioxide and methane. Planning for climate change means taking into account both how we might reduce our effects on the climate, today and in the future, and how changes in climate might affect our facilities and operations. Against a baseline set in 2007, the Growth Management Planning Council adopted a Countywide Planning Policy that targets a reduction in countywide sources of GHG emissions of 25 percent by 2020,50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. King County will be responsible for assessment and reporting. At a regional level, the division and its planning participants continue to strengthen and broaden waste prevention and recycling programs to continually improve our long-term, positive effects on the environment (discussed in detail in Chapter 4, Sustainable Materials Management). The benefits are tangible in terms of reductions in GHG emissions, resource conservation, and energy savings. (K4C) King County and thirteen cities Kirkland, Mercer lsland, Normandy Park, Redmond, Renton, and Tukwila - are collaborating through the King Col,laboration (K4C) to coordinate and en,hance the effectiveness of local climate and s'ustainability action. Through K4C, county and city staff are partnering on: outreach to engage d,ecision makers, other cities, and'the general public; coordination of consistent standards, benchmarks, and strategies; sharing solutions; funding; and shared resource opportunities. All King County cit,ies are encouraged to join this ef:fort, which is supporting and enhancing projects and programs i,n focus areas such as green building, using and producing renewable energy, sustainability outreach and education, a,nd alternative Page 46Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 Considerations of how division activities and operations might affect climate change involve both positive and negative impacts on GHG emissions. lf areas where GHG emissions can be expected to occur are identified, strategies to mitigate those emissions can be developed, for example: . The division contracts with Bio Energy Washington to turn landfill gas into pipeline-quality natural gas for the energy market. . The division builds facilities (such as the Shoreline, Bow Lake, and Factoria Recycling and Transfer Stations) that are more energy efficient to meet LEED' standards. As previously noted, two of the facilities have earned a Platinum rating.Cornpactors at the Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station compact trash, reducing the number of trips that county transfer trucks make to Cedar Hills . Garbage compactors, both for solid waste and recyclables, are being installed at all new urban transfer stations, which will decrease truck trips by up to 30 percent, saving fuel and decreasing emissions. . ln day-to-day operations, the division looks for ways to reduce resource use and increase the use of environmentally friendly products. Examples of operational practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions include the use of compaction to reduce truck trips, reducing idling time, environmentally preferable purchasing, and exploring the use of compressed natural gas and other low-emitting technologies in trucks and equipment. . The Food: Too Good to Waste program also helps curb the effects of climate change. Uneaten food accounts for 23 percent of all methane emissions - a potent climate change contributor. When food is thrown away, all the water and energy used to produce, package and transport that food is also wasted. The program educates people about how to plan and prepare meals to decrease the amount of wasted food. ?{3# ffi#43ffi TO WASTE. The division teamed up with the City of Seattle to produce Greenhouse Gas Emissions in King County (Stockholm Environment lnstitute 2012), a report that looked at greenhouse gas emissions from several different perspectives including undertaking a consumption-based inventory.The inventory offers a more complete picture of the county's environmental footprint, taking into account emissions associated with the production and consumption of food, goods, and services.The reportt research shows that efforts such as reducing food waste or purchasing sustainable and low-impact products can help to create a broader and deeper impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. . The division has planted deciduous and evergreen trees on the Duvall and Puyallup/Kit Corner closed landfills to create a carbon \"sink\" by capturing carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis. The division also looks at the potential impacts of climate change on facilities and operations and determines strategies for adapting to those impacts. For example, the division is using more drought-tolerant plants in facility landscapes and identifying alternate transportation routes to avoid areas where there may be an increase in seasonal flooding. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -July zot9 Att A Page 472-23Ordinance 18893 Updated April '17,2019 King County - Climate Change Proper solid waste rnanagement plays a significant role in reducing GHG emissions.

Equity is achieved when all people have an equal opportunity to attain their full potential. lnequity occurs when there are differences in well-being between and within communities that are systematic, patterned, unfair, and can be changed. These differences are not random; they are caused by our past and current decisions, systems of power and privilege, policies, and the implementation of those policies. Socialjustice encompasses all aspects of justice, including legal, political, and economic; it demands fair distribution of public goods, institutional resources, and life opportunities. ln solid waste system planning, the division examines ways that it may affect equity and socialjustice through its programs and services. . Fair distribution of transfer facilities, services at the facilities, and division resources, such as the community litter cleanup, school education, and green building programs, helps ensure that everyone has access to services that create safer and healthier communities. . The division provides technical assistance to ensure that the benefits of green building strategies, such as lower energy costs and improved indoor air quality, are available to residents of affordable housing developments. . ln siting new transfer facilities, the division engages communities to ensure equal opportunity for involvement in the siting process. The division uses demographic data to ensure that these essential public facilities are distributed equitably throughout the county and that any negative impacts of the facilities do not unfairly burden any community. . In addition to translating materials into multiple languages, the division has added a Spanish-language component to its comprehensive outreach programs.

The division routinely collects data about the amount and composition of waste and recyclable materials in the system, tracks demographic and economic trends that will affect the amount of solid waste generated in the future, and conducts focused studies to address specific topics, such as markets for recyclable materials, industry trends, and new technologies. Forecasts are used to estimate the amount of material expected to be disposed and recycled in the coming years, incorporating expected growth in population and other demographic and economic trends. This information can be used to estimate the necessary capacity of division transfer and disposal facilities and associated private-sector recycling facilities and markets. Existing data and forecasts form the basis for discussions with cities and other stakeholders about options for the future, answering questions such as: . How much waste are system users currently generating and expected to generate in the future? . How can waste generation be reduced? . What materials can be separated from the disposal stream and turned into a resource through reuse and recycling?Division staff review plans . Who uses the solid waste facilities and curbside services, how do they choose those services, how often do they use those servicel and what influences their choices? . What is the best method to provide these services? . What changes in markets and technologies need to be incorporated into our analysis of options for the future? Forecasts, planning data, and studies used in the development of this Plan are discussed in the following sections Fo reca sti n g The division uses a planning forecast model to predict future waste generation over a 20-year period. Waste generation is defined as waste disposed plus materials recycled.The forecast is used to guide system planning, budgeting, rate setting, and operations. The primary objectives of the model are to 1) estimate future waste disposal and 2) provide estimates of the amount of materials expected to be diverted from the waste stream through division and city waste prevention and recycling programs.The planning forecast model - a regression model - relies on established statistical relationships between waste generation and various economic and demographic variables that affect it, such as population, employmen! consumptiont (measured as retail sales, excluding sales), and the tipping fees for garbage at division facilities. 1 The numbers for the soles tox bose is taken from \"The Puget Sound Economic Forecaster\" which is published by Western Woshington University. Sales tax base and price information are all adjusted for inflation. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu zotS Att A Page 553-1Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 ln late 2007, a nationwide financial crisis severely compromised the division's ability to forecast short-term trends in the economy. With the collapse of large financial institutions, a downturn in the stock market, a drop in housing prices and personal income, a jump in the unemployment rate, and a general slump in overall economic activit, the recession led to the bankruptcy of many businesses and home foreclosures. The effects of these dramatic events touched every sector of the economy including the solid waste industry. ln 2007 , garbage tons received at Cedar Hills surpassed the one million mark, due primarily to steady economic growth and population increases in the region over the previous few decades. Between December 2007 and December 2012, however, garbage tons disposed at Cedar Hills declined 20 percent overall. Garbage tons dropped eight percent in 2008 alone. The City of Seattle, surrounding counties, and jurisdictions in Oregon and California reported similar or greater declines in tonnage, as did regional recycling firms. The recession created a great deal of unpredictability in variables used in the division's forecast model to predict the short-term (one to five year) trends in solid waste generation. To respond to this uncertainty, the division has adjusted its approach to forecasting, using a more flexible system of ongoing monitoring. This evolving forecast method involves: . Monitoring solid waste tons delivered to division transfer stations and the Cedar Hills landfill on a daily basis, . Regularly checking regional and state-wide economic forecasts (local economic forecasts by the Western Washington University (former Dick Conway and Associates), King County's economic forecast, and forecasts by the Washington State Economic and Revenue Forecast Council), . Monitoring state-wide tax revenue streams, particularly in the home improvement sector, furniture store sales, clothing sector, and other key markets, and . Communicating regularly with other jurisdictions about the trends in their service areas. This information has been used to forecast short-term tonnage and subsequent revenues for use in critical budgeting, expenditure control, and management of capital projects over the three-to five-year period. With the new model established in 2018, the division is able to provide a prediction for disposal for the next ten years. After ten years, the tonnage forecast uses a long-term growth rate based on historical tonnage (described in further detail below). The new model also assumes that a years-long Ecology-reported recycling rate of 52 percent is sustained through 2040. An additional feature the division included in the new model is an upper and a lower estimate for the tonnage to be disposed. The main characteristics of the new model are: .

Discussions and data often focus on recycling and recycling rates, when in fact waste prevention is the number one priority'While programmatic successes for waste prevention can be assessed qualitatively, it is difficult to measure directly how much waste is \"not created\" in terms of tons or percentages. What can be measured more accurately is recycling and disposal activities. Data for these activities are available through division tonnage and transaction records, reports from the curbside collection companies, the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), and the division's waste characterization studies. Using data on the types and amounts of materials recycled, combined with measures of waste disposed, the division can evaluate its success in reaching the goals established with each successive comprehensive solid waste management plan. Figure 3-4 shows the tons of materials recycled and disposed in 2015 (most recent data from Ecology) by category of waste generator - single-family residents; multi-family residents; non-residential customers such as businesses, institutions, and government entities; and self-haulers who bring materials directly to the division's transfer stations. More specific information on each generator type (including generators of construction and demolition debris for recycling and disposal) follows. Recycling data comes from numerous external sources.These are described in more detail in the section Tracking Our Progress. Note that the scale on each figure varies.

As Figure 3-4 illustrates, the single-family sector provides the greatest opportunity to divert materials from disposal, with about 260,000 tons of materials disposed in 2015. Single-family residents are recycling more than zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan -Jufi zotB Att A Page 593-5Ordinance 1 8893 Updated April 17, 201 I 56 percent of their waste, but division studies indicate that a large portion of the disposed materials could be recycled or reused (as discussed in the next section). The multi-family sector generates the least amount of garbage and recycling of all sectors, but shows a need for improvement in recycling. The data shows that self-haulers as a group are recycling the smallest fraction of their waste.That may be because at many of the older transfer stations there is limited or no opportunity to recycle. At this time, however, two of the division's urban stations are undergoing, or are being considered for, renovation. A major goal of the renovation plan is to add space for collection of more recyclables and to build flexibility into the design to allow for collection of additional materials as markets develop. Adding space for collection of greater amounts and a wider array of materials is expected to result in higher recycling rates at the transfer stations. With studies indicating that 70 percent of the waste that reaches the landfill could have been recycled or reused, and specific data on what those materials are, we can focus on areas that will have substantial influence on the region's per ca pita disposal rate. The following sections add ress each category of generator a nd identify some of the more significant areas for improvement. Sing le-Family Residents Sixty-five percent of the households in the division's service area are single-family homes. ln 2015, these single-family households recycled on average about 56 percent of their waste. Ninety-six percent of the yard waste and 79 percent of the paper generated were recycled by this sector in 2015 (Figure 3-5). While food scraps and food-soiled paper made up over 35 percent of the waste disposed by single-family residents in2015, recycling of these materials has increased as participation in the curbside collection program for these materials continues to grow. Considerable amounts of the standard curbside recyclables - glass and plastic containers, tin and aluminum cans, mixed waste paper, newspaper, and cardboard - while easily recyclable, are still present in the waste disposal stream.

Other recyclables found in the single-family waste stream in smaller amounts include scrap metal, textiles, plastic bags and plastic wrap, and some construction and demolition debris, such as clean wood and gypsum wallboard. lf all recyclable materials were removed from the single-family waste stream, nearly one-third of the remaining, non- recyclable materials would be disposable diapers and pet wastes. M u lti-Fa m ily Residents Thirty-five percent of the households in the service area are in multi-family complexes. ln 20 15, the average multi- family recycling rate in the county's service area was 21 percent. While this rate is considerably lower than the single- family rate, overall generation and disposal from multi-family residences is lower and the difference from single-family recycling rates is less when yard waste (which is minimal for multi-family) is removed from the calculation. As with single-family residents, the primary areas of opportunity are in recycling food scraps and food-soiled paper and the standard curbside recyclables, including paper and cardboard (Figure 3-6). Figure 3-6.2015 Recycling and disposal by multi-family residents Containers* Containers* Plastic bags & Wra Mixed paper Food scraps & food waste Yard waste Scrap metal Other materials15Plastic bags & Wrap Mixed Food scraps & food waste Yard waste Scrap metal Other materials Tons Recycled:36,034 'Tin, aluminum, glass, and plasticTotal Tons Generation : 173,1 1 ITons Disposed: 137,084 Other materials present in the multi-family waste stream, both recyclable and non-recyclable, are similar to those found in the single-family waste stream. It is difficult to track multi-family recycling rates because of: 1) the varied nature of multi-family complexes, 2) the growth in construction of mixed-use buildings that contain both residential and non-residential units, and 3) the varied levels of recycling services provided. What is clear is the need to provide adequate space for garbage and recyclables collection at these complexes and to standardize collection across the county. A detailed discussion of ways to improve recycling at multi-family and mixed-use complexes is provided in Chapter 4, S ustai n a bl e M ateri a ls Ma n a g e m en t.Material Material zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Non-Residentia I Generators Nonresidential generators - businesses, institutions, and government entities - recycled an estimated 73 percent of their waste in 2015. Despite having the highest recycling rate of any sector, non-residential generators still present an opportunity for increasing King County's overall recycling rate (Figure 3-7). There are an estimated 771,000 employees in the service area working at an estimated 49,000 businesses and organizations. The make-up of the non-residential sector ranges from manufacturing to high-tech and retail to food services.The recycling potential for any particular business or industry varies depending on the nature of the business. For example, restaurants and grocers are the largest contributors of food waste, while manufacturers may generate large quantities of plastic wrap and other packaging materials. Because of the diversity of business and industry in the region, a more individualized approach is needed to increase recycling in this sector. There are significant opportunities in the non-residential sector to increase the diversion of food scraps and food- soiled paper. The largest increase will be realized as more restaurants and grocers contract with private-sector companies to collect their food scraps for composting and more cities begin to offer commercial organics collection.

While large amounts of paper are being recycled, almost 40,000 tons of recyclable paper were disposed by businesses in 2015. Paper may also provide an opportunity for waste prevention - not just moving from disposal to recycling, but aiming to reduce the generation of waste paper. zotg Contprehensiue Solid Waste Managetnent Plan u lers Self-haulers are residential and non-residential customers who choose to bring garbage and recyclables to the transfer facilities themselves. According to on-site surveys conducted as part of the division's waste characterization studies, the two most common reasons given for self-hauling are: 1) having a large quantity of waste or large or bulky items to dispose, and 2) wanting to avoid the cost of commercial collection. About 37 percent of the materials disposed by self-haulers have the potential for recycling, most significantly clean wood, yard waste, scrap metal, and paper (Figure 3-8).

No recyclables are collected at the Algona Transfer Station due to space limitations. At the stations that have been renovated and there is more space, additional materials such as textiles, scrap metal, used bikes and appliances are also collected. Other materials will be collected as markets develop. There are a number of materials still prevalent in the self-haul waste stream for which there are currently insufficient or no recycling markets, such as treated and painted wood. Generators of Construction and Demolition Debris ln 2015, nearly 900,000 tons of construction and demolition debris were generated in King County. Debris from the construction, remodeling, repair, or demolition of buildings, other structures, and roads includes clean wood, 3-9Material Material zotg Contprehensiue Solid Waste Managentent Plan A Page 63Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,201s painted and treated wood, dimensional lumber, gypsum wallboard, roofing, siding, structural metal, wire, insulation, packaging materials, and concrete, asphalt, and other aggregates. Clean wood makes up about 24 percent of the construction and demolition debris that is being disposed. Other recyclable construction and demolition materials that are being disposed include scrap metal, clean gypsum, and asphalt shingles. Figure 3-9 shows the composition of construction and demolition materials diverted and disposed in 2015 based on reports from private processing facilities, Ecology data, and waste monitoring at the division's transfer stations (Cascadia 2012a). Most concrete, asphalt, and aggregates are source separated for recycling at jobsites and are not reflected in these numbers.

Tracking Prog ress The division uses a wide range of available data, both qualitative and quantitative, to evaluate the success of waste prevention and recycling efforts. Over the years, the division has developed a robust collection of surveys and data from a variety of sources to track progress. ln most cases, more than one source of data is needed to accurately quantify how well the region is doing in diverting materials from the waste stream. For example, to track progress toward a target of 4.1 or fewer pounds of waste per employee per week, the number of employees in the service area for a given year is divided into the annual tons of garbage generated by the non-residential sector, as reported zotg Comprehettsiue Solid Waste 64Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 in customer surveys conducted at transfer stations and information submitted to the division by the collection companies. Using these data, pounds per week can be calculated. The targets are tracked using aggregate data for the service area, rather than using data by individual city or unincorporated area. The following subsections provide information on the types of data collected, how those data are calculated, and how reliable the data are, as well as recommendations on how the data might be improved. Tonnage and Transaction Data An automated cashiering system is used to track data on the tons of garbage received and number of customer visits at division transfer facilities. ln-bound and out-bound scales weigh loads for all vehicles except fixed-rate vehicles (as defined in KCC 10.04.020 MM), which are charged a minimum fee that assumes a weight of 320 pounds or less. These data are used to track overall garbage tonnage and transactions at individual stations. Data for recyclables accepted for a fee, such as yard waste, are also tracked by the cashiering system. For recyclables collected at no charge, data are provided to the division by the hauling company that is contracted to collect them. Reports from the Commercial Collection Companies The private-sector companies that provide curbside collection of residential garbage and recyclables throughout most of King County submit monthly tonnage reports to the division. These reports are also provided to the cities. Data for single-family households are the most complete, providing the following monthly information for each city and for unincorporated areas operating under a Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission tariff: . Tons ofgarbage disposed, . Tons recycled by material type, . Tons of organic materials recycled (yard waste, including food scraps for most areas), and. Number of garbage, recycling, and organics collection customers. Generally, customer counts and tonnage numbers for single-family garbage, recycling, and organics are the most reliable because they are based on weights measured at the entrance scale of either county transfer stations (for garbage) or material recovery facilities (for recyclables), To estimate the tons of individual materials (such as newspaper, aluminum cans, and so on), collection companies take periodic random samples and determine the percentage of each material present in the loads. As overall recycling tonnage is weighed, tons for individual materials are allocated based on the percentages obtained in the random sampling.The county has worked with the haulers to develop and implement a standard protocol for sampling in order to provide reliable estimates of the component recyclables and contaminant materials. The same information provided for single-family residents is provided for multi-family residents and nonresidential generators; however, the per capita data are less accurate because the number of apartment units and business customers is not provided. ln some cases, the same truck collects multi-family and nonresidential wastes, so collection companies must estimate how much waste comes from each generator type. Even though some waste may be allocated to the wrong generator type, overall changes in recycling and disposal are reflected in tonnage totals, thereby providing a reasonable indicator of change. Since non-residential recycling collection is open-market and because many companies besides the large hauling companies provide commercial recycling services, a non-residential recycling rate cannot be calculated from the collection company data. This means that an overall system-wide recycling rate cannot be calculated using these data alone. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -JuQ zotS Att A Page 653-11Ordinance 18893 ated 201917 Ecology Survey Data Data on the total tons recycled come from the annual statewide survey of recycling companies conducted by Ecotogy. These data supplement curbside collection data by including recyclables collected by private sector companies across the region. Recycling companies are required by state law to report tonnage data on the survey, which asks for tons by material type, by generator type (residential or non-residential), and by the county in which the materials were generated. For King County, companies are also asked if materials were generated in the City of Seattle. The division uses the Ecology survey data to estimate both non-residential and overall recycling rates. All of the recycling tonnage reported by Ecology is counted as non-residential except for tonnage that was included in residential collection company reports and recycling tonnage from transfer stations. Use of this accounting method means that recyclables taken by residents to privately owned drop boxes or recycling centers are included in the non-residential recycling tonnage. Ecology survey data are also used to estimate construction and demolition debris diversion. While the Ecology data provide the status of statewide efforts, there are some limitations to the usefulness of the data for local planning and evaluation, including the following: . Because data from Ecology is not immediately available, there is about a three-year lag before the county is able to finalize annual recycling rates, . Data are self-reported by recycling companies, with few resources available to Ecology for checking accuracy, . Companies make unverified estimates about the county in which the recyclables were generated, and the reporting for data between King County and the City of Seattle has been inconsistent, resulting in tonnage variations from year to year which seem unlikely, . City-specific information, other than for the City of Seattle, is not available, . The identification of residential versus non-residential sources is not reliable, . The identity of some companies that report data is confidential, limiting the ability to verify the quantities reported, and some of the companies with confidential data report only statewide totals, which requires the county to estimate allocation based upon population percentages, and . Significant amounts of metal are reported; it is difficult to determine how much of this metal should be counted as municipal solid waste, how much as construction and demolition debris, and how much as auto bodies, which the county does not include in its waste generation or recycling totals. lmproving the reliability of recycling data would greatly benefit our ability to evaluate progress in reaching our recycling goals. The division will work with Ecology and the cities to develop voluntary agreements with recycling companies that will improve data reporting and resolve data inconsistencies. Waste Characterization Studies Since 1990, the division has conducted a Waste Monitoring Program to understand who uses solid waste system ' facilities, what materials they bring to the stations, how and why they use our facilities, and how satisfied they are with the services provided. To answer these questions, the division retains consultants to conduct both waste characterization studies and customer surveys that analyze the municipal solid waste received at county facilities zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Managetnent Plan Page 66Ordinance '18893 Updated Aptil 17 ,2019 for disposal at Cedar Hills. For these studies, the waste stream is examined by collecting and sorting sample loads delivered to transfer facilities in King County. These studies help the county and the cities understand the composition of both the overall waste stream and what is received from different types of generators, such as residents of single- family homes and apartments, non-residential customers, and self-haulers. Separate analyses are conducted of the construction and demolition debris and organics waste streams. The waste characterization studies are designed to provide a statistically valid picture of what is being disposed by the different generator types. Samples are taken over the course of a full year to account for seasonal variations. The sampling method is designed to ensure that all generator types and geographical areas are sufficiently sampled. The studies provide a high level of confidence of what is in the waste stream. Each study, described beloW is conducted by the division as necessary to provide up-to-date information for planning purposes. Solid Waste Characterization Studies The most recent study of solid waste destined for Cedar Hills was conducted in 2015 (Cascadia 2015a). For this study, 421 samples were collected on 28 sampling days. The waste stream was separated into 97 categories of material. For each material and generator classification, the study was designed to achieve a 90 percent confidence interval for the amount of waste disposed countywide. ln other words, the study tells us that we can be 90 percent sure that the amount of cardboard disposed in 2015 was 3.1 percent (26,112 tons) of the total waste stream, plus or minus 0.3 percent. These waste cha racterization studies are not designed to characterize each city's waste stream. However, based on sampling done in a variety of communities, the types of materials disposed by residents are similar, while the amounts may differ. For example, jurisdictions with food waste collection programs will have lower percentages of food in their garbage than those without. These differences are reflected in the recycling rates and pounds disposed per household for each jurisdiction. ln-person surveys are also Garbage at the Bow Lake Recycling and rransfer Station administered to customers bringing materials to transfer facilities (Cascadia 2015a). Customers are asked about the types of wastes they are bringing, the origin of those wastes, reasons for self-hauling (rather than using curbside collection services), how often waste is self-hauled, and willingness to separate out various recyclable materials. These surveys provide a better understanding of the customers who visit the stations and, in turn, provide the proper levels of service. The surveys are also useful in informing programmatic decisions. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -zot8 Att A Page 673-13Ordinance 1 8893 Updated April 17, 2019 Customer satisfaction surveys are also conducted at the stations to evaluate the level of satisfaction with customer service and the disposal and recycling services provided at division facilities (Cascadia 2016). The division uses this information to monitor its performance and identify areas where improvements can be made. Orga nics Cha racterization Stud ies Curbside yard waste collection services throughout King County accept food waste (food scraps and food-soiled paper), and the division is now working to measure how much food waste is actually collected from residential sources. Reports from the collection companies provide information about total tons of organics delivered to compost facilities, but do not differentiate between yard waste tons and food scrap tons. The solid waste characterization studies described above measure decreases of food scraps and food-soiled paper in the waste stream, but not whether the decreases result from curbside collection or from other diversion, such as home composting. To improve our ability to measure progress in organics recycling and establish achievable goals, the division is conducting periodic characterization studies of organics collected at the curb from single-family households.The division conducted its fourth organics waste characterization in2017 (Cascadia 2017b) and plans to conduct studies every two to three years. The study looked at total organics generation, assessing how many food scraps were disposed in the organics cart and the garbage can. The division has started planning for discussions with stakeholders to ensure there is adequate organics processing capacity for the materials now being disposed to be processed more sustainably in the future. Construction and Demolition Debris Characterization Studies ln 2001, the division began to conduct periodic characterization studies of construction and demolition debris disposed at select private facilities by commercial and self-haulers, as well as small quantities delivered to division transfer stations by self-haulers. The studies measure the composition of construction and demolition debris that continues to be disposed instead of recycled. Three studies have been conducted to date, with the last study completed in 2011 (Cascadia 2012a).lnformation from the waste composition studies helped to inform what materials would be designated as readily recyclable under the new construction and demolition debris recycling ordinance (see Chapter 4, Sustainable Materials Managementfor more information). Planning Tools To support overall system planning and determine appropriate rates, the division conducts focused studies to evaluate elements of the solid waste system and its operations, emerging technologies and industry challenges, and private-sector markets for recycling and reuse. The division will conduct additional planning studies as needed to explore a variety of topics including best practices in solid waste management, alternative disposal technologies, and sustainable financing. Major studies used in development of the Plan are listed on the next page.

Working together over the last almost 30 years, both the public and private sectors have taken the region well beyond curbside recycling by creating myriad programs and services that foster the recycling and reuse of materials that might otherwise be thrown away and, more importantly, that prevent waste from being created in the first place. Since the 2001 Comprehensive SolidWaste Management Plan was adopted, the collection system in the region has evolved significantly.The number of materials that can be recycled or processed for recycling and reuse has increased, technologies for collecting materials have improved, and participation in curbside recycling has continued to climb. Along with the growth of recycling in the region, however, comes issues that could potentially impact how much and what materials are recycled. Since inception of the waste reduction and recycling programs, markets and processing capacity for materials have fluctuated. Recent issues such as China's restrictions on multiple materials markets, contamination of recyclables and organics, and almost reaching local capacity to process organic materials, are testing the system's resilience. Working through these challenges with the cities and local haulers and processors will ultimately strengthen recycling, collection and processing in the region. Two key developments have added to the increase of materials collected in single-family residential curbside recycling in the region. First is the transition to commingled (or single-stream) collection. Since 2001, the collection companies have transitioned to commingled recycling, whereby all the recyclable materials are placed in one large cart for curbside pickup. A second development is the addition of food scraps and food-soiled paper to yardwaste collected curbside. ln 2001, the division began working with cities and collection companies to phase in curbside collection of food scraps and food-soiled paper in the yard waste (organics) cart. Compostable food scraps and food-soiled paper, which currently make up about one-third of the waste disposed by single-family residents, include all fruit, vegetable, meat, dairy products, pastas, grains, breads, and soiled paper used in food preparation or handling (such as paper towels). Food and yard waste, either separated or commingled, are referred to as organics. Nearly 100 percent of single-family customers who subscribe to garbage collection now have access to curbside food scrap collection, OnlyVashon lsland and the Skykomish and Snoqualmie Pass areas, which house less than one percent of the county's residents, do not have this service.Food scraps can be collected in small containers lined with compostable bags to make it easier to recycle zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 834-1Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 ln addition to these major developments, programs such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design'\" and Built Green'\" are encouraging the building community to focus on waste prevention, recycling, and reuse of construction and demolition debris and helping to stimulate markets for the recycling and reuse of construction and demolition materials. ln the 1980s, projections indicated that with the growing population and economy in the region, the amount of garbage that residents of King County would throw away would continue to climb steeply. Through the efforts of the county and area cities, businesses, and individual citizens, the amount of garbage disposed per resident per week dropped from 35 pounds in the 1980s to 15.2 pounds in 2014-a reduction of almost 57 percent.This reduction in disposal has contributed to extending the life of the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill (Cedar Hills) by more than 20 years. Yet even with the increased recycling and waste prevention seen over the years, recent waste characterization studies conducted by the division indicate that about 70 percent of all materials disposed in the landfill are resources that could have been recycled or reused. As discussed in this chapter, identifying what these materials are and who generates them can help us determine where future efforts should be focused to achieve ongoing improvements. Concentrating efforts on a particular class of waste generator (e.9., residential or business) or commodity type can yield measurable results. Four categories of information, discussed in detail herein, can be used to evaluate the current status of waste prevention and recycling efforts and help develop strategies that will lead to future improvements: 1. Waste prevention programs achieving results in the region. 2. Recycling and disposal rates by type of waste generator (discussed in Chapter 3, Forecast and Data), including. Single-family (up to 4 units) and multi-family residents (in some cities may include townhomes),. Non-residential generators, such as businesses, institutions, and government entities,. Self-haulers, both residents and businesses, who bring materials to division transfer facilities, and . Generators of construction and demolition debris. 3. Types and quantities of recyclable or reusable commodities that remain in the waste stream, such as food scraps, clean wood, metals, and paper. 4. The status of markets for recyclable materials, availability of take-back options for used products, and opportunities to partner with private-sector businesses, national coalitions, and other jurisdictions to effect change. lnformation from these four categories was used to shape the goals and recommended actions presented in this chapter. To set the stage, this chapter begins with a description of the benefits of recycling and a discussion of our regional goals for the future. From there the focus moves to ways to sustain the momentum by looking at additional waste prevention, resource conservation, recycling, and product stewardship opportunities. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the status and challenges of collection by customertype. Benefits of Recycling Efforts The regional commitment to recycling has many benefits-financial, social, and environmental. Financial benefits are probably the most immediate for many county residents and businesses. Convenient recycling services not only provide an alternative to the higher cost of disposal, but also provide a long-term significant cost savings for ratepayers by increasing the lifespan of Cedar Hills. As discussed in Chapter 6, Landfill Management and Solid Waste Disposal, Cedar Hills landfill is a more cost-effective means of disposal than the other disposal alternatives currently zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu zotS 4-2 Att A Page 84Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 available. After Cedar Hills reaches capacity and closes, minimizing the amount of waste that requires disposal will translate directly into lower fees for King County ratepayers. The social benefits of recycling can be described in terms of economic growth and job creation. Materials diverted from Cedar Hills for recycling must be sorted, processed, and transported. The 2016 Recycling Economic lnformation (REl) Report (EPA,2016) includes information about the recycling jobs, wages, and tax revenue benefits. The report shows that recycling and reuse of materials creates jobs, while also generating local and state tax revenues.ln2007, recycling and reuse activities in the United States accounted for: .757,000jobs, . 536.6 billion in wages, and. 56.7 billion in tax revenues. This equates to 1.57 jobs for every 1,000 tons of materials recycled. Construction and demolition debris recycling provides the largest contribution to all three categories (job, wage, and tax revenue), followed by ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum.The Recology Store is a place to both recycle items and to purchase items made from recycled materials (Photo courtesy of Recology CleanScapes) The positive environmental benefits of recycling are local and ultimately global. Environmental benefits are focused in two primary areas, both of which have wide-reaching and long-term impacts. First, the release of pollutants emitted during the production and disposal of products is decreased, reducing the potential for harm to human health and the environment. Second, savings in energy use and associated reduced greenhouse gas emissions will result from decreased demand to process virgin materials into products, which also contributes to a healthier planet. Figure 4-1 illustrates a circular supply loop. The figure graphically shows the opportunities, values, and benefits of organics recycling in King County. Goal and Targets The goal and targets for waste prevention and recycling were established through extensive discussions with the division's advisory committees:the Solid Waste Advisory Committee (SWAC) and the Metropolitan Solid Waste Management Advisory Committee (MSWMAC).The countywide goal and targets are intended to improve the effectiveness of established waste prevention and recycling efforts. The recommended actions for implementation presented at the beginning of this chapter were developed to provide general strategies for meeting the goal and targets and to identify the agency or agenci'es that would lead those efforts. The recommended actions are intended to serve as a guideline for the county and cities. They do not preclude other innovative approaches that may be implemented to help achieve the goal and targets. Factors other than waste prevention and recycling programs and services can increase or decrease the overall amount of waste generated. For example, the 2007 economic recession resulted in significant, unanticipated reductions in garbage collected, stemming primarily from the drop in consumer spending and business activity in the region. When establishing the goal and targets and measuring success in meeting them, it is important to consider the economy, policy changes, and other factors that may be in play. 4-3zotg Comprebensiue Solid Waste Management PIan -Ju/1 zotS 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Figure 4-'[ Organics: Opportunities, values, and benefits in King County Food, yard, and wood wastes: Opportunities, values, and benefits in King County 2015Organics recycling retains useful materials in the economy, creates new job opportunities, converts a would-be waste into beneficial, marketable products for farmers and gardeners, reduces the need for petroleum-based chemicals and fertilizers, improves nutrient recycling, and reduces the impacts from dlsposal. xmettictonsof Page 86Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Waste Prevention and Recycling Goal and Targets ,Achieve Zero Waste of Resources - i.e., eliminate the disposal of materials with economic value - by 2030 through a combination of efforts in the following order of priority: waste prevention and reuse; product stewardship, recycling, and composting, and beneficial use. Per Capita - 20.4 pounds/week This target addresses residential waste from single- and multi-family homes. Per Employee - 42.2 pounds/week This target addresses waste from the non-residentia'l sector. Reductions in disposal over time indicate an increase in waste prevention and/or recycling. Per Capita - 5.1 pounds/week This target addresses residential waste from both single- and multi-family homes. Per Employee - 4.1 pounds/week This target addresses waste from the non-residential sector. Establishing waste prevention targets and measuring success in achieving them is a challenge, because data quantifiing the amount of waste not generated is difficultto obtain. However, bytracking overall waste generation (tons of material disposed + tons recycled) over the years, King County can attempt to identify regional trends in waste prevention. A decline in waste generation means that the overall amount of materials disposed or recycled, or both, has been reduced.The county also uses data from reuse and repair, building salvage, commercial food waste prevention grants, catalog/junk mail/phone book opt-outs, and material efficiencies spurred by product stewardship, to help determine whether waste prevention progress is being made. Recycling will continue to be an important strategy to reduce the disposal of solid waste.The recycling goal combines single-farnily, multi-family, non-residential, and self-haul recycling activity. lt addresses the amount of waste being diverted from disposal at the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill to recycling. lt does not include construction and demolition debris (which have separate recycling goals), or other wastes, such as car bodies, which ar,e not typically handled through the county system. ln 2015, the overall recycling rate for the county was 54 percent. The goal for this planning period reflects the estimated recycling rate achievable if the recommended strategies in this plan are fully implemented (see Figure 4-3). Overall interim 874-5Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 What is Your Recycling Rate? lt Depends on What You Count. Currently, there are no state or national standards for what should be counted in the\"recycling rate\" for a city or county. As a result, recycling rates reported by various jurisdictions may include different materials. For example, the recycling rate reported by some jurisdictions includes many materials that are not managed as a part of the county's system, so they are not included in establishing the county's recycling rate. This includes construction and demolition debris, asphalt and concrete, auto bod,ies, and biosolids. Many of these materials are very heavy and can considerably incr:ease a recycling rate based on tons. ln addition, some jurisdictions add percentage points to their recycling rate to account for the estimated success of their waste prevention efforts. The division has chosen to calculate King County's recycling rate based on the known amount of materials diverted from disposal at the Cedar Hills Regional Landflll. As such, it does not i,nclude materials such as construction and demolition debris or car bodies that are handled largely by the private sector. Neither does the division include any estimate of waste prevention, primarily because of the lack of measurable data. For example, based on the definition above, the county! recycling rate in 2014 was 52 percent. Adding recycled asphalt and concrete would raise the calculated rate to approximately 62 percent. The rate would have been higher still if hard-to-measure materials such as car bodies and land clearing debris were added, Given the va,rious methods for calculating a recycling rate, it is important to understand what materials are being counted before comparing rates across jurisdictions. Figure 4-2.Recyding rate over (2014) =35o/o eq Regional Commitment to Single Stream Recycling 1990 1995 18893 April 17,2019 As can be seen in Figure 4-2, the recycling rate has stalled, even as waste generation has increased in recent years. The role of individual cities will be critical in reaching our countywide waste prevention and recycling goal and targets. The way in which each city contributes to the overall goal and targets, however, may vary depending on the city's demographic make-up and other factors. For example, a city with a large concentration of apartments and condominiums might focus more efforts on programs for multi-family residents. Communities with primarily single-family homes might focus education and promotion on food scrap recycling for their residents. Another factor cities may consider is the make-up of their business (or non-residential) sectors. Cities with many restaurants, grocers, or other food- related businesses might look at ways to promote the recycling offood scraps or to partner these businesses with local food banks to donate surplus food to those in need. Similarly, cities with booming construction activity may want to take advantage of markets for the recycling and reuse of construction and demolition materials. Westwood Help Stop Food Waste campaign Likewise, the county will consider the make-up of the unincorporated area in which to focus waste prevention and recycling efforts. The county and the cities lead by example to improve waste prevention and recycling in their respective operations, at their facilities, and at sponsored events, for instance: . Some cities have held their own zero waste events and picnics, . The county and many cities collect food scraps and food-soiled paper at their offices and associated sites, and . The county enacted an ordinance to purchase copy paper that is 'l 00 percent recycled content and reduce paper use by 20 percent.

Table 4-1 below identifies these tools and cites some of the successes achieved through their use. Table 4-1 . Examples of successes achieved using various tools zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Matzagetnent Plan - July zot9Establishing the collection and processing infrastructure is always the first step. lt can be accomplished through enhanced curbside collection services, additional recycling options at transfer facilities, and partnerships with private-sector processing facilities and manufacturers/retailers, e.9., to develop take-back programs.New transfer facilities are being designed with dedicated areas for recyclable materials such as yard waste, clean wood, and scrap metal. Approximately 99 percent of single{amily curbside collection customers have access to collection service for food scraps and food-soiled paper, along with the yard waste. Through E-Cycle Washington electronics manufacturers have developed a statewide network of locations for recycling televisions, computers, and monitors, Likewise LightRecyde Washington established a network to collect mercury-containing lights. Educational programs and targeted advertising play a key role in initiating new programs and sustaining the momentum of existing programs. These efforts can be tailored to specific waste generators or materials.The division's Green Tools team provides education, resources, and technical assistance on how to manage construction and demolition debris as a resource rather than a waste. Many cities provide assistance to businesses to establish and maintain recycling programs. EnviroStars Green Business Program is a free program that offers rebates, resources, and incentives to businesses who take action to protect the environment and employee health and safety. Bellevue, Kirkland and King County are founding members. To encourage waste prevention and recycling, curbside garbage collection fees increase with the size of garbage can that customers subscribe to creating a \"pay as you throw\" (or variable rate) system. ln addition, embedding recycling in the rate can also act as an incentive. Some cities provide kitchen containers and sample compostable bags to encourage residents to recycle their food scraps.lncentives encoura ge recycling. For example, in a pay-aryou{hrow (orvariable rate)type program, if a customer generates less garbage, they need a smaller garbage container, which means a lower charge on their garbage bill. lncentives can also take the form of a give-away item that makes waste prevention and recycling easier. 4-8 Att A Page 90Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 Mandates that restrict the disposal of specifc materials have proven effective in increasing recycling, particularly in instances where there is a viable and developed recycling market for those materials. Mandates can be legislated at the local, state, or federal level, or implemented through city contracts.ln orderto discourage disposal ofyard waste, its disposal in curbside garbage has been prohibited since 1993. ln 2005, fluorescent lights and many electronics were prohibited from disposal at King County transfer stations to encourage the recycling of these items and use of the Take lt Back Network http://www.kingc0unty.g0v/depts/dnrpholid-warte/progroms/take-it-bock. 0spx. To increase recycling, the division requires self-haulers to separate their materials at county transfer stations. Starting in 2018, cardboard, metal, yard waste, and clean wood is banned from disposal at transfer stations that provide recycling services for these materials. Enforcement of program rules ensures that materials are recycled or disposed of properly.The construction and demolition debris program employs a King County sheriffto enforce the recycling and disposal rules for construction and demolition materials. 0utreach and progressive fines are issued to violators to encourage them to learn how the materials should be handled. Product stewardship efforts rely on partnerships to implement programs. The division routinely partners with other organizations to further product stewardship goals through the Northwest Product Stewardship Council.Partnerships enable a program to be amplified by bringing in other organizations or agencies to assist with the program The successful diversion of residential yard waste from disposal exemplifies the effective use of four of these tools. First, an infrastructure was created to make it easy to separate yard waste from garbage. Curbside collection programs were implemented in phases across the county, easy-to-use wheeled collection containers were provided to residents, and private-sector businesses began turning the collected yard waste into compost for building healthy soils. Promotions were used to inform residents of the availability of curbside collection as the service was phased in. Educationalcampaigns were launched to teach citizens how to compost yard waste from their own yards for use as a soil amendment. Because the cost of collecting yard waste for composting was less than the cost of disposal in the garbage, residents had an incentive to subscribe to yard waste collection service.

Finally, mandates were passed by the cities and the county to prohibit residents from disposing of yard waste in the garbage wherever separate curbside yard waste collection was available. The resulting collection system for yard waste successfully recycled almost 96 percent of the yard waste disposed by single-family residents in 2015. Taking a Sustainable Materials Management Approach Thefollowing discussion describes a differentwayto lookatthewaste prevention and recycling programs and activities already in place. lt describes the advantages of a sustainable materials management approach that encompasses the full life-cycle of materials: design and manufacturing, use and reuse, and end-of-life. Figure 4-4 graphically depicts the sustainable materials management approach. This approach has been adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as the Washington State Department of Ecology in the last update of the state solid waste plan (Ecology 2015). Sustainable materials management still focuses on recycling and disposal, but by including production, design, use, and reuse, it provides an opportunity to identify more resilient, sustainable ways to design products that prioritize durability and recyclability, and use less energy, water, and toxics. Figure 4-4. Materials life cycle Source: Moving Washington Beyond Waste and Toxics, 2015 zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Page 92Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 Decisions to reduce waste can be made at several critical stages in a product's life cycle, helping to develop a circular supply loop: . When manufacturers decide what goods to produce, how to design them, how to produce them, and how to package them, . When consumers decide whether and what to purchase, and . When consumers adopt ways to use and reuse products more efficiently. The following sections provide examples of programs in the different phases of sustainable materials management. Design and Production Food: Too Good to Waste - This program educates consumers on ways to prevent wasting food. When food is wasted, it also wastes all the water and energy used to produce, package and transport it from the farm to table. ln addition, about 33 percent of the single-family garbage disposed at Cedar Hills is food, which significantly reduces landfill capacity and life. Green Schools Food Waste Reduction and Food Share - The King County Green Schools Program assists schools and school districts to reduce wasted food through a number of strategies:. Encourage students to take what they will eat and eat what they take,. Set up cafeteria share tables on which students may place or take unopened, packaged foods and drinks from the school lunch program, and. Donate unopened, packaged items and uneaten whole fruits that cannot be re-served to students. The goals of the School Food Share program are to minimize wasted foods and beverages and safely distribute unwanted items from school lunch programs to local food banks and meal programs. Use and Reuse Threadcycle is a public education campaign sponsored by King County and Seattle Public Utilities that encourages residents to donate used clothing, shoes, and linens for reuse or recycling. Local thrift stores and other organizations are partners in the program and willtake all clothing, shoes, and linens regardless of condition (except items that are wet, mildewed, or contaminated with hazardous materials). The EcoConsumer public outreach program sponsors Repair Groups and Repair Group event provides an opportunity for residents to bring in broken events. Each repair event or group itetns for repair operates differently, based on the needs of the local community. lt might be a one-time event, or they may be held every few months. People can bring to these events household items including small furniture, small appliances, personal electronics, and clothing that need to be repaired. Experienced all-purpose fixers and sewing fixers will work on the items, and can also help residents to learn to do their own repair. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 zotS 934-11Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 i:,=' ::,'1i.,. \\. Waste Prevention, Recycling and Climate Change The purchase, use, and disposal ofgoods and services by King County residents, businesses, and governments are associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Emissions can occur at all stages of a product's life - fr,om resource extraction, farming, manufacturing, processing, transportation, sale, use, and disposal. ln 2008, consumption-related GHG emissions in King County totaled more than 55 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) - more than double the emissions produced within the county's geographic boundaries (King County 2012). As a major employer and service provider in the region, King County government is also a major consumer of goods and services,These goods and services - especially construction-related services - account for 270,OOO MTCO2e, or about 42 percent of the Cou,nty3 operations-related GHG emissions (King County 2012). Residents, businesses, and governments can reduce GHG emissions associated with goods and services by choosing sustainable options, reducing the amount they purchase, reusing and repairing goods when possible, and recycling after use. King County is involved in these efforts through the solid waste management services and procurement efforts that the county provides, as well as through the county's efforts to educate residents and businesses about ways to use less and recycle more. The county is also taking a number of steps to reduce the environmental footprint of the products used in government operations and to reuse previousl wasted resources. Recycling outreach -The Solid Waste Division's Recycle More - lt's Easy to Do campaign promotes basic recycling of curbside materials, food scraps and yard waste. Other programs that support increased recycling and waste prevention include the Green Schools Prograrn, which supports conservation in schools. Recycling infrastructurc - ln King County in 2010, about 832,000 tons of recyclable materials were collected by private hauling companies at the curb and about 10,000 tons were collected at King County transfer stations. Turning this waste into resources resulted in the reduction of approximately 1.6 million MTCO2e of GHG emissions. Reusing resources - King County is helping develop, expand, and support markets for reused and recycled products. The LinkUp program has expanded markets for recyclable and reusable materials such as asphalt shingles, mattresses, and textiles.The EcoConsumer program has expanded reuse by prornoting and supporting tool lending library projects in the county. End-of-Life Ma nagement Product stewardship is a life-cycle approach that is being implemented at the state, national and international levels. ln practice, the product manufacturers - not government or ratepayers - take responsibility for their products'tradle to cradlel' This means that manufacturers are given the authority to finance and provide for the collection, recycling and/or proper management of their products at the end of the product's life cycle. 4-12 _ :ot9 Conprehenslue Page 94Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 The division is on the steering committee of the Northwest Product Stewardship Council (NWPSC) and has been participating in the development of product stewardship strategies for commodities that contain toxic materials or are difficult and expensive to manage, such as paint, carpet, mercury thermostats, rechargeable batteries, mattresses, junk mail, and telephone books. The division and NWPSC were instrumental in getting state legislation adopted to implement the E-Cycle Washington and LightRecycle Washington extended producer responsibility programs. Both programs provide drop-off sites for consumers to take their electronics and mercury-containing lights. The division also worked to get a secure medicine return program implemented in King County. The program started in February 2O17, and has approximately 100 locations where residents can securely dispose of unused medications. What do I do with...? Hundreds of thousands of visitors use this application annually to find recycling, reuse, and disposal options. Businesses and organizations maintain their listing of the materials and products they recycle, reuse, or dispose of as a requirement of being included as a partner on this high traffic division website. One of the oldest recycling databases in the country, What do I do with...? has evolved over almost twenty years from a printed paper directory to a modern, mobile friendly application. The most searched-for materials are consistently: Appliances, Batteries, Construction / Demolition Debris, Electronics, and Furniture. The division constantly seeks to refine and improve the What do I do with...? website, which currently provides information on over 100 materials. Turning Wastes to Resou rces ln 2004, King County adopted \"Zero Waste of Resources\"as a principle designed to eliminate the disposal of materials with economic value. Zero Waste does not mean that no waste will be disposed; it proposes that maximum feasible and cost-effective efforts be made to prevent, reuse, and reduce waste.The division has been taking steps to eliminate the disposal of materials that have economic value and for which there are viable markets. King County's list of designated recyclables is defined and updated by Ecology's annual statewide survey of materials that have been recycled in Washington.The current list is shown in Table 4-2:Recicla Mas Facilitadores or facilitators of recyclinq teach recycling and composting basics at a community event 18893 Updated 17, 20,l9 Table 4-2.

These factors are also used to determine the appropriate method for capturing the materials, i.e., through curbside collection or at county transfer facilities. The division may also consider other technologies such as anaerobic digestion or demonstration projects of other evolving technologies that promote resource recovery as ways to recycle or reuse materials. Since the 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan was issued, the list of materials that are being recycled has grown substantially. ln 2017, over 931,000 tons of solid waste were disposed at Cedar Hills. As shown in Figure 4-5, at least limited options in the market exist for the recycling of about 70 percent of the materials disposed. Figure 4-5. Recycling potential of materials disposed in 2015 ffi Readily Recyclable I timited Recyclabitiy O trtot Recyclable For years, the Pacific Northwest has relied almost exclusively on exporting recyclable paper and plastics to China for processing. ln early 2018, however, China made the specification for contamination so low (0.5 percent) that it is extremely difficult to meet, essentially banning the import of 24 recyclable commodities, including unsorted paper and mixed #3 - #7 plastic. Recyclable materials entering recycling facilities may be contaminated for a variety of reasons, including commingling the materials in one bin, new packaging types, and resident confusion. Some materials being collected as part of the approved recyclables list have no markets, contaminate other valuable recyclable material, and/or create problems in the processing system (examples include plastic bags, poly-coated paper, cartons and aseptic packaging). China's ban is intended to crack down on illegal smuggling of foreign waste brought in under the guise of recycling, improve environmental quality, and reduce the volume of contaminated recyclables legally brought into the country. ln response, agencies, cities, and haulers in King County have formed the Responsible Recycling Task Force (Task Force). The Task Force will identify common ground for advancing recycling given China's restrictions on acceptable recyclables, focusing on short-, mid- and long-term actions. Tenants of responsible recycling include: zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Managetnent Plan 974-15Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 . Focus on the quality and quantity of recyclables, including reducing contamination, . Use consistent and harmonized messaging across the region, . Prioritize domestic processing and markets for recyclables (including the socialjustice and environmental impacts of export), . Create domestic demand for recycled feedstock, . Understand that responsible recycling is not free, and . Shift to measure recyclables that are made into new products. While this issue presents a policy challenge for the region, it offers an opportunity to improve on recycling in the region, reeducate the public on recycling best practices, reduce contamination, and reinforce waste prevention messaging. Priority Materia ls The following sections describe priority materials identified by the division for recycling through curbside collection and at county transfer facilities, Priority Materials for Curbside Collection Over time, new materials that can be efficiently and cost-effectively captured for recycling are added to curbside collection programs. Adding materials for curbside collection requires sufficient infrastructure for collection and processing, and viable and sustainable end use markets. Standardizing the materials collected across the county simplifies recycling education, reduces confusion among consumers as to what is recyclable, and increases collection efficiency. However, all materials listed as priorities are not required to be recycled in all city programs. When the 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan was adopted, materials collected at the curb included newspaper, cardboard, mixed paper, plastic bottles, tin and aluminum cans, glass bottles and jars, and yard waste. Materials added since that time include food scraps and food-soiled paper; aerosol cans; small scrap metal; plastic jugs and tubs; plastic plant pots, trays, and clamshells; plastic and paper drink cups; and aseptic containers. Organics More than one-third of what gets disposed at Cedar Hills landfill is food scraps and food-soiled paper. Collection and processing of these food scraps is critical to meet the county's ambitious waste diversion targets and climate change goals. There is also a growing effort to capture a large portion of the food scraps that are still considered to be edible. A recent division study of service management businesses and restaurants in King County (Cascadia 2017b) estimated that approximately three-quarters of the food scraps these businesses generated was edible food. Significant opportunities remain to reduce and prevent the tons of food scraps that are disposed. Commercial haulers throughout King County offer organics collection to both residential and commercial customers Nearly all single-family households (99 percent) in King County have access to curbside organics collection that includes food scraps and food-soiled paper products. Unpackaged food scraps and approved compostable paper products can be collected along with yard waste in the same containers. King County and many cities have implemented public education and outreach campaigns to promote and increase participation in food scrap zotg Comprehensiue So/id Waste 18893 Updated April 17,2019 diversion through curbside organics collection. The division also funded a grant program to promote commercial food scraps recycling. While participation rates appear to be increasing, there remains room for improvement. Challenges to food scraps collection include customer access (such as at multi-family residential units where organics collection is not required or offered by property management), participation levels in diversion programs, political and institutional barriers, and the level of contamination of the organics collected. As collection of organics increases it will be essential to ensure adequate regional processing capacity and reduced contamination of material. The division is actively working with regional partners to: Engage in long-range planning to increase organics processing capacity, Encourage greater use of compost, and Encourage operational changes at processing facilities to mitigate impacts on the surrounding community. Prionty Materials for Collection at King CountyTransfer Facilities The division has identified several priority materials to collect at all transfer stations once they are renovated or replaced:. Yard and wood waste,. Cardboard,. Clean wood (not treated or painted), and. Scrap metal. Some materials designated for curbside collection and/or as priority materials for transfer station collection are also collected by private-sector businesses. Markets for Recyclable Materials LinkUp - Expanding Markets for Recyclable and Reusable Materials Market development is an important strategy to ensure that recyclable materials are successfully moving from waste to resource. The division is working to expand markets for recyclable and reusable materials and facilitate the infrastructure that supports those markets, through its LinkUp Program. Working with businesses, public agencies, and other organizations, LinkUp develops projects that address specific market barriers (from collection to processing to end-use) that prevent or restrict a material or product from moving up the value chain for ultimate reuse or use as a raw materialfor manufacturing new products. ln recent years, LinkUp has conducted projects to improve markets for asphalt shingles, carpet, mattresses, compost, and textiles. Projects have supported efforts, such as the development of collection and processins infrastructure for asphatt roofins shinstes, carpet, and R:5!\"jj:Xlfl:::'Jil#?[iL'JJ3L?\" mattresses; establishment of the hot mix asphalt pavement market for Shown here are asphalt shingles used in asphalt shingles; expansion of theTake it Back Network to include latex paving roads paint, and promotion of the network to the public; public education to promote donation of damaged textiles for reuse or recycling; and demonstration of the use of compost for agricultural applications by King County farmers. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management P/an -Jufu zo8 Att 994-17Ordinance 18893 Updated April and 2017 Market Assessments ln 2015 and 2017, Cascadia Consulting Group conducted market assessments for the division that focused on commingled curbside recyclables, organics, electronics, film plastics, and construction and demolition materials (Cascadia 2015b and Cascadia 2017). First, Cascadia conducted a preliminary analysis and ranking of potential focus materials. Evaluation metrics included disposed tons, disposed volume, GHG emissions if recycled rather than landfilled, ability to influence the county's recycling rate, and market strength.Table 4-3 shows the results of the preliminary analysis and ranking. Table 4-3. Findings from 2015 and 2017 market assessments * Materials for which the division is already engaging in market support through the LinkUp program. Cascadia then conducted \"mini assessments\" of the top six ranked materials, combining two categories of electronics, and excluding textiles and mattresses, for which the division already has market support efforts underway. Findings from these studies, which looked at the material supply for recycling, processing capacity, and current markets, included: . Markets for commingled curbside recyclables, including paper, plastics, glass, and metals were generally stable in 2015. However, China's 2018 implementation of their\"National Sword\" policy to restrict the importation of mixed paper and mixed #3-#7 plastics has resulted in the immediate closure of a significant market for these recyclable materials. Annually, around 138,000 tons of these recyclable materials from King County that would normally go to China now need to be processed elsewhere. At this time, alternative export and domestic markets for mixed paper and mixed plastics are extremely limited. Food scraps and plastic film/wrap are the biggest contamination challenge in curbside commingled recycling. eotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan food-soiled paper* (lean wood Textiles* Film MediumElectronics (covered #3-7 plastia Mattresses* (same score as #3-7 plastia) Clean (new) gypsum Electronics (not covered by FCycle) Asphalt Shingles* Carpet LowTreated wood AttAPagel00Ordinance 18893 Updated April17,2019 . Almost all organic materials collected within the King County system are being converted into compost products, which are primarily used as soil amendments. Anaerobic digestion (a biological process that transforms organic waste into renewable energy, and in some situations, a useable residual by-product) is an emerging processing technology in the region. More organics processing capacity is likely needed if there are to be significant increases in food scraps and food-soiled paper composting in King County and surrounding regions (See Chapter 5 for more information about processing capacity). Market prices and sales of compost products are reported to be stable. Expanding agricultural compost markets is of interest. . Wood and plastic films have significant barriers to successful recycling. Wood markets are stable but weak and highly dependent on use as hog fuel. Barriers to plastic film recycling occur at all points of the supply chain. Grants to Cities Waste Reduction and Recycling Grants The division provides grant funds and technical assistance to cities to help further waste prevention and recycling programs and services within their communities. Each year, King County distributes over 51 million in grant funds to cities; these funds are supported by the solid waste tipping fee. All cities in the service area are eligible for the funds. Clean wood is collected at the Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Station The formula for their allocation includes a base amount plus a percentage based on the city's population and employment. Currently, much of these grant funds is used by the cities to hold recycling collection events in their communities. The cities and the county may be able to phase out these collection events and use the funds in other ways that support waste prevention and recycling in their communities as enhanced recycling services are added at renovated transfer facilities, curbside collection for bulky items becomes more cost effective and widely available, and product stewardship programs begin to offer more options for recycling. The grant monies can be used to support a number of activities, including: . Encouraging and promoting waste reduction, . Continuing to implement and improve general recycling programs, . lmproving opportunities for the collection of specific commodities, such as paper, . lmproving opportunities for the collection and/or composting of organic materials, . lncreasing the demand for recycled and reused products, . Fostering sustainable development through the promotion of sustainable building principles in construction projects, . Managing solid waste generated by public agencies in a manner that demonstrates leadership, . Broadening resource conservation programs that integrate waste prevention and recycling programs and messages, and . Providing product stewardship opportunities. zotg Conprehensiue Solid Waste Management A Page 1014-19Ordinance '18893Updated April 17,2019 [ocal Solid Waste Financial Assistance Grants Ecology also supports waste prevention and recycling programs in King County through the Local Solid Waste Financial Assistance (formerly known as the Coordinated Prevention Grant) program. Funds are allocated within the county based on population. The division uses funds allocated to the unincorporated areas to support waste prevention and recycling efforts such as recycling collection events, yard waste and food scrap recycling, and natural yard care education and promotion. The cities also receive funds directly from Ecology to support their own waste prevention and recycling programs (applications are coordinated through the division). Competitive Gra nt Program ln2012, the division worked collaboratively with the cities to develop a new competitive grant program to fund innovative projects and services that further the waste prevention and recycling goals outlined in this Plan. Cities, commercial collection companies, and other entities, such as non-profit organizations or schools, would be eligible to apply for the grant program. The program has not been approved by the cities or funded through the solid waste rate, but the division will continue to work with the cities to identify opportunities to initiate the new competitive grant program in the future. Cities use some of their grant money to hold recycling ln the meantime, the division has initially funded collection events a small competitive grant program through the Solid Waste Division budget with the focus on commercial food waste. A program funded through the solid waste rate would extend reach and impact. Descriptions of the funded projects can be found online at: your.kingcounty.gov/solidwoste/garbage-recycling/commercial-grants.asp Sustainable Pu rchasingI King County is also working to reduce the impacts of its operations by purchasing products that have recycled content and are more resource-efficient and durable. The Sustainable Purchasing Program provides county personnel with information and technical assistance to help them identify, evaluate, and purchase economical and effective sustainable products and services. The division will continue to provide technical assistance to cities by sharing contracts, specifications, and procurement strategies. Many cities in the county have also implemented environmentally preferable purchasing programs. Another strategy to increase sustainable purchasing is to provide training and education about the benefits of compost applications in parks and landscape projects, topdressing grass in parks, and stormwater management applications. 4-2O, - t\"pcr-prrhr,,ti Att A Page 102Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Collection The remainder of this chapter looks at the current collection challenges and recommendations for improvement for three sectors of generators - single-family households, multi-family households, and non-residential customers, which include businesses, institutions, and government entities. For each sector, the issues may vary and present different challenges due to collection methods and the regulations by which they are governed. Construction and demolition debris is discussed separately at the end of this chapter because of the unique nature of collecting and processing these materials. Residentia I Col lection The residential garbage collection system in King County is a well-established system that serves the region in a safe, efficient, and cost-effective manner. With the shift toward increased collection services for recyclables and organics, customers can choose to subscribe to smaller, less expensive collection cans for their garbage. Container sizes now range from the micro-can at 10 gallons to the mini-can at 20 gallons and on up to the large 90+ gallon cart. The reduced fee for the smaller cans creates an incentive to generate less waste and divert as much material as possible to the recyclables or organics carts. Throughout King County, individual city contracts for collection of garbage, recyclables, and organics differ in a number of aspects. Cities have entered into contracts with the collection companies at different times and then renewed contracts as they have expired. Each time a contract is negotiated and renewed, the city may make adjustments to their services such as changing the range of materials being collected, the collection frequency, container types or sizes, fee structures, and more. Changes to services may also be negotiated for existing contracts. The varying collection standards among cities that have resulted from these changes over time have led to inconsistencies in regional education and messaging, confusion among customers, and difficulties in measuring and potentially attaining region wide goals. To illustrate the varying collection standards that currently exist, Table 4-4 presents a summary of single-family collection services by city and unincorporated area, showing the types of contracts held, the collection company serving the jurisdiction, container sizes offered, collection frequency, and fee structures.The recycling rates for each jurisdiction and unincorporated area, with and without organic materials, are also presented for comparison. The UTC cost assessment in Appendix A (Section 3.3) provides additional information about the UTC-regulated and contracted companies. Working with the community and the hauler, the division is exploring the inclusion of Vashon/Maury lsland in the service level standards, as well as other ways to improve recycling services provided curbside and at the transfer station. Skykomish and Snoqualmie Pass will not be included in the service level standards at this time becauseA truck picks up in a neighborhood (Photo courtesy of Republic Services) of their remote locations and low population densities. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid lVaste Management 32 25 24 25 29 29 27 23 22 27 20 26 26 20 23 28 29 )1 f? 28 24 21Fee Structure .C EqJ EJ !orc(U -LY1 a) CGc!O)!!6o(, X X X X X X X X X X.C !(j f!r:o_L -U:v,9G>\\ -o OGcc (, X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOWC u ui:c 0J .'o:;ifo:o-IJ tru6FL.Y f,NE? gXEr3 EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOWo- u.Ycl.3u E-Euo)F\\C \\O >. ocJNC( EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOW EOWCart Size (gallons)b 6 L-,) Eh:.U ;o 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 96 OA 96 966(J -d)Yc !9 =uUaJrt1 tW 64 96 96 96 96 64 96 96 96 96 64 96 96 96 96 96 96 64 96 64Type of Collection' C F qJ 7.ci9oi; or!q -9CA>(, mffi X X X X X X X X X X XF = o c (J c UTC c UTC c c c c c c c Clty c c c UTC c c c cc .o ,'i 6voSeooNIJffi R5 RS RS RE RE RE RS RS RE Clty RE RS RS RS RE RS RS R5G(J !!CJ Hill Enumclaw Federal Way Hunts Point lssaquah Kenmore Kent Kkkland Lake Forest Park Maple Valleyi Medina Mercer lsland Newcastle Normandy Park North 96 NSCart Size (gallons)b 6U -orYc -U->=u6E 96 96 >.,q 9ori6 ot!x >r9 X\\JF = UG of Collection\" .9 WasteConnections WM - Waste Management b Cart sizes listed are the most commonly distributed; other cort sizes are available in many jurisdictions. c Collection Frequency: EOW-everyotherweek W-weekly M - monthly NS -no serviced Recycling and disposal rates include an adjustmentto rcmove i estimated contaminant tonnage from recycling totals and add it todisposaltotals. j e Pacific's Pierce County and King County areas are served by Waste Management effective Octobet 5, 201 5 (update 1/8/16). k f Bothell's primary houler changed from Woste Management to Recology on January 1, 201 5 .

While it would be difficult to identify a single factor or factors that will ensure a higher recycling rate, there are some factors that appear to lead to increased participation and amounts of waste diverted from disposal, as discussed in the following sections. Range of Materials Collected ln addition to the materials identified for curbside collection in the last Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan - newspaper, mixed paper, and cardboard; tin and aluminum cans; plastic bottles; glass bottles and jars; and yard waste - new materials have been added over time. These materials include food scraps and food soiled paper, aerosol cans, small scrap metal, plastic jugs and tubs, plastic plant pots, plastic trays and clamshells, drink/coffee cups, and aseptic cartons/containers (such as juice boxes). Some cities have added other materials for collection, such as electronics, fluorescent bulbs and tubes, and motor oil. Curbside collection, however, is not necessarily the most efficient and cost-effective way to capture every type of recyclable or reusable product. Some products cause problems for materials recovery facilities because of their size or composition, while others are better candidates for take-back programs by manufacturers and retailers to extract potentially harmful components and recycle other components. Examples of these types of materials and their particular challenges include the following: . Plastic bags and plastic wrap are prevalent in the waste stream, particularly residential. Collection of plastic bags in the recyclables cart creates a nuisance further down the line at the material recovery facilities. As the bags move through the facility they sometimes catch in and jam the sorting machinery, and they can blow around and cause litter problems. For these reasons, curbside collection may not be the best option for plastic bags and wrap at this time. More appropriate options for consideration may be an increased use of reusable shopping bags and the establishment or expansion of take-back programs at the retail level. For instance, the Wrap Recycling Action Program (WRAP), a national initiative, provides a network of drop-off locations for clean and dry plastic film, including wraps, bags and flexible packaging, to be recycled. . Electronic Products and Fluorescent Bulbs and Tubes Collecting these materials at the curb is complicated by the fact that some of them tend to break easily and contain potentially hazardous materials that must be safely disposed. ln Washington State, legislation requires man ufacturers of com puters, monitors, and televisions to provide separate locations for free recycling of these items. Handling electronics through product stewardship ensures that the various components, such as glass, plastic, and metals, are separated and recycled as appropriate and that any potentiallyFluorescent tubes are collected at the Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste -Jufi Page 106Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 hazardous materials are recycled or disposed in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Product stewardship efforts reduce costs to local governments and their ratepayers by eliminating the costs to recycle these products. Take-back programs have also been implemented for fluorescent bulbs and tubes. Cities such as Kent and Shoreline and have contracted with their recycling collection companies to develop a safe, convenient program for collecting fluorescent bulbs and tubes at the curb. The City of Bothell's garbage and recycling collection contract includes curbside collection of electronic products and fluorescent bulbs and tubes as well as collection at theThe Recology Bothell store. Some cities offer collection of small appliances and home electronics not covered by Washingtont current product stewardship laws. For appropriately sized products that do not contain hazardous materials, curbside collection is a viable and efficient option. . Polystyrene Foam - One type of plastic that is not recommended for residential curbside collection is expanded polystyrene foam, commonly known as Styrofoam, which includes clamshell containers for take-out foods and blocks of plastic that are used to package many electronics and other goods. These materials are light and bulky, can break easily into small pieces, readily mix with other materials causing contamination, and are difficult to separate out at the material recovery facilities. ln addition, the quantity collected is so small that it takes a long time to collect enough of the material to ship to market. Although there are challenges to collecting expanded polystyrene foam packaging curbside, the City of Des Moines began offering its single-family residents this service in2012. Block expanded polystyrene foam (not packing peanuts) is accepted and residents are asked to put the blocks in a clearly labeled plastic bag and place it next to their curbside recycling cart. This allows the expanded polystyrene foam blocks to be handled separately from the commingled recyclables. The cities of lssaquah and Seattle have taken another approach and banned the use of expanded polystyrene foam containers for take-out foods. Other cities, such as Kirkland and Redmond, have regular or semi-regular collection events to collect expanded polystyrene packaging. Size of Collection Contoiner The size of the recycling collection cart can affect recycling success. Areas where most residential customers use smaller recycling carts have reported lower recycling rates and when larger carts have been provided the recycling rate has increased. As more materials are identified for commingled recycling, and food scraps are added to the yard waste cart, recyclables carts are getting larger and the size of garbage can to which customers subscribe should become smaller. F req uen cy of Col lection Adjustments to the frequency of curbside collection for garbage, recyclables, and organics can also be used to influence recycling and disposal behaviors and reduce collection costs and truck traffic. Garbage collection across King County typically occurs on a weekly basis. This collection schedule has been driven, in part, by the presence of food scraps and other organics in the garbage that rapidly decompose and have the potential to lead to environmental or public health concerns. With separate collection of organics for recycling, there is an opportunity to modify weekly garbage collection to benefit ratepayers and to create a more environmentally sustainable system. One of the most important factors in determining the appropriate collection frequency for the various material streams, particularly for organics (yard waste and food scraps), is compliance with the public health and environmental standards in Title 1 0 of the Code of the King County Board of Health. To study the effects of changing the collection method and possibly the frequency of collection, in summer 2007 the division conducted a pilot zotg Cotnprehensiue Sohd Waste Management P[an 1074-25Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Regulatory Changes Allow Adjustments in Collection Frequency Schedules After successful completion of the Renton pilot study, a variance to Title 1 0 of the Code of the King County Board of Health was approved to allow every-other-week collection of organics (with the yard waste) for single- and multi-family residents, as well as every-other-week collection of residential garbage. The variance applies as long as the following standards (excerpted directly from the variance) are met. During the next review of theTitle 10 Health Code, these variances are scheduled to be adopted.

The purpose of the study was to explore the public health and environmental impacts, customer responses, and effects on potential waste diversion that would result from changes in collection. ln particular Public Health was concerned about the feasibility of collecting meat and bones every other week in the yard waste cart and changing garbage collection to less than weekly. To explore these concerns, approximately 1,500 Renton households participated in the six-month pilot study to look at two different collection schedules: . Every-other-week collection of all three solid waste streams - garbage, recyclables, and organics, and . Every-other-week collection of garbage and recyclables and weekly collection of organics. The pilot study showed positive results for both collection schedules tested. There were no negative health or environmental impacts observed, and customers were highly satisfied with the collection schedules and the container sizes provided to adjust for the shift in schedule. Study results indicated not only a 20 percent decrease in the amount of garbage disposed, but an overall reduction in the generation of garbage, recycling, and organics, An added benefit was the reduction in truck traffic and transportation costs with the less frequent collection cycles. As a result, the City of Renton rolled out a citywide program in -January 2009 to offer every-other-week collection of garbage and commingled recyclables, with every week collection of organics. Renton is the first city in King County to provide every-other-week garbage collection as the standard collection serviceforsinglefamilyhouseholds.By20l3,Renton'sdisposal perhouseholdhaddroppedby23 percent. While other factors such as the economic downturn likely played a role in disposal reductions, data from all of King County over the same time period estimated a disposal drop of 8 percent, suggesting that every-other-week garbage is a significant tool to reduce disposal and increase recycling. zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id April 17,2019 Fee Structure Curbside Recycling Services: ln nearly all areas of King County, households paying for garbage collection services also cover the embedded cost of recycling collection services. ln most cases, unlimited amounts of recyclables can be set out. ln contrast, the fee for garbage service varies depending on the number or size of containers each household sets out. A variation of this pay-as-you-throw system is to couple it with a linear rate structure in which there is no \"bulk discount\"for having a larger container and the price per gallon is the same across all service levels. Consequently, King County residents have a clear financial incentive to reduce the amount they dispose and increase the amount they recycle. Curbside Organics Services: Sixteen cities, comprising about 55 percent of the population in the county, have adopted rate structures that embed the cost of organics collection in the curbside garbage collection fee, providing a further incentive for residents to reduce disposal and maximize use of the recycling options for which they are paying. ln 2016, the average pounds of garbage disposed per household in these cities was 12 percent lower than the average for the rest of King County. Curbside Collection of Bulky ltems for Residents An ongoing issue with collection is finding the most efficient and cost-effective way to handle bulky waste - larger, individual items that do not fit in a garbage can or recycling cart. This type of waste includes recyclable items such as appliances, potentially reusable items such as furniture, and other large items that must be disposed. Bulky waste collection services are available from collection companies throughout the county; however, these services are not widely used. Residents may not use the service because it is expensive, ranging from $25 to 5128 per item, with the possibility of additional charges for travel time and labor. Customers may also be unaware of the collection options available to them. The primary alternatives to bulky curbside collection are self-hauling the materials to transfer stations for disposal or recycling, or taking them to collection events sponsored by the county or the cities. Neither of these self- haul options is an efficient way of handling the materials because of the number of vehicle trips, the increased number of transactions at transfer stations, and the high cost of staging collection events.Bulky items are taken to a special recycling collection event The current recommendation is to work with collection companies and the UTC to explore options to increase the efficiency and reduce the price of curbside collection of bulky items. For example, the cost would be lower if a small charge were included in the regular garbage fee, and curbside collection days were regularly scheduled and promoted, thereby increasing the efficiency of the collection routes. Collection systems for bulky items should be designed, to the extent possible, to divert reusable items to charitable organizations for resale, reuse community organizations (Green Bee or Buy Nothing community groups), and recyclable items to processing facilities. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Managetnent 201 I Single-Family Residential Minimum Collection Standards Single-family collection services for garbage, recyclables, and organics are well established. As discussed earlier, however, there are many variations among the cities in the specific methods of collection and rate structures. The division has evaluated the factors that appear to lead to higher recycling rates and an increase in the diversion of materials from the garbage. Based on this evaluation, it is recommended that minimum collection standards be adopted by the cities and unincorporated areas to provide the optimal service level for reducing waste and increasing the diversion of recyclables and organics from disposal. Working with the community and the hauler, the division is exploring the inclusion of Vashon/Maury lsland in the service level standards, as well as other ways to improve recycling services provided curbside and at the Vashon Recycling and Transfer Station. Skykomish and Snoqualmie Pass will not be included in the service level standards at this time because of their remote locations and low population densities. The minimum collection standards can be implemented as the county updates its service-level ordinance and jurisdictions amend their collection contracts (some of these targeted standards may not require changes to contracts or the county's service-level ordinance). A description ofCurbside collection (Photo courtesy of Recology CleanScapes) the recommended collection standards follows in Table 4-5. Continuing education and promotion will also be important for increasing recycling and reducing wastes generated by single-family residents. The cities and the county will increase education and promotion to encourage the recycling of food scraps and food-soiled paper. ln concert with the commercial collection companies, the cities and the county will also continue to focus promotions on the proper recycling of the standard curbside materials to increase participation and reduce contamination in the recycling containers. Financial incentives will also be explored through the fee structure for garbage and recyclables and grants to cities. zotg Conprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Juj zotS Att A Page 1114-29Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Table 4-5. Single-family minimum collection standards xSubject to stotus of recydobles on King County s Designoted Recydobles List Multi-Family Residential Collection Multi-family recycling has not been as successful as single-family recycling. There are a number of contributing factors, including space constraints for collection containers and a higher turnover of residents and property managers. These factors make it difficult to implement standardized collection services and provide consistent recycling messaging to this diverse sector. Some local progress has been made, however, in developing consistent design standards to accommodate waste in multi-family complexes. ln addition, in many areas of the county there is a trend in the construction of mixed-use buildings, which contain retail shops on the lower level and residential units above. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management PIan -Ju/y zotSNewspaper, cardboard, mixed paper, and polycoated paper Plastic bottles, jugs, and tubs Tin and aluminum cans Glass bottles and jars Aseptic packaging Small scrap metalYard debris Food scraps Food-soiled paperRequired Materialsfor Collection*Mixed solid or wheeled cartsWheeled Wheeled carts ContainerType 90+ gallon if collected every otherweek Smaller size if collected more frequently or if requested by customer90+ gallons if collected every other week Smaller size if requested by customerContainer SizeSubscriptions available for various sizes Frequency of CollectionMinimum of once a monthMinimum of every otherweek Minimum of every other week Fee Structure Fee increases with container sizeRecyclables collection included in garbage fee Additional containers available at no extra charge0rganics collection included in garbage fee Additional carts may be included in base fee or available at an extra charge Customers requesting smaller carts may be offered a reduced rateOrganics Garbage Recyclables 4-30 AttAPagell2Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 similar challenges for recycling, including: .

Different customer types, both residents and employees, with different recycling needs. Recycling could be increased substantially at multi-family complexes and mixed-use buildings by adopting minimum collection standards for multi-family collection.The multi-family standards vary somewhat from the single-family standards to account for differences in service structure. To improve recycling at mixed-use buildings, the cities and the county must consider both the multi-family collection standards and the recommendations for non-residential collection.

To further increase recycling in multi-family and mixed use buildings, the division, in cooperation with other jurisdictions, property managers, and owners of multi- family properties, collection companies and other stakeholders, has conducted several research and pilot studies (KCSWD 2014b and 2016b). The findings from these studies conclude that successful recycling depends on: . Collection logistics: Effective programs place recycling containers for convenience, access, and ease of use; provide sufficient space and capacity for collection both inside and outside of the buildings; provide tools for collection, storage, and transport of recyclables and organics from units to collection points; and clearly label col lection containers.T Recycling and garbage containers at an apartment complex. The signs detail what should be put in each bin . Policies and regulations: Clear policies ensure that recycling is available and addresses issues such as contamination. Examples might be service level ordinances, city contracts that embed recycling in garbage rates, and building code requirements. . Education and outreach: Effective recycling and food waste collection in multi-family buildings hinges on education and outreach. Strategies such as door-to-door outreach, property manager trainings, and onsite assistance have been successful. ln addition, education and outreach that addresses non-English speaking communities is crucial. lmproving multi-family recycling will likely require, at a minimum, the following actions: . Clarify and strengthen building code requirements -The division's GreenTools program has been working collaboratively with cities to develop standards that can be used for multi-family buildings. lf adopted, these standards will help ensure that enough space is designed to allow for recycling in future construction. . Research collection and demographic characteristics, complex by complex - Planning outreach strategies should begin with a careful look at language and other population demographics, collection infrastructure, tenant turnover rate, and other applicable characteristics of each complex. Outreach strategies must be comprehensive and flexible to fit the complex. Customized combinations of outreach tactics and education reinforcement, designed to address the researched characteristics of that complex, help ensure successful outreach which will increase recycling and decrease contamination. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Updated April 17,2019 . Provide manager and maintenance staff education - lnvolvement and support from the property manager and staff is important to the long-term success of multi-family recycling. The institutional knowledge property managers can provide and the role they play in delivering education to each tenant and at each container are important considerations. This function should be supported with training and materials. . Provide ongoing recycling education for residents - Recycling education needs to be provided on a continuing basis because most multi-family complexes have high tenant turnover. Providing education materials with the lease and at least annually coupled with information through newsletters and posters ensure that residents get the message and it is reinforced on a regular basis. . lnvolve collection companies to assist with service improvements and education - The collection company should be involved to provide insight and information about complexes'recycling infrastructure systems and to help with education outreach and feedback to the tenants about the quality of the recycling and level of contamination. Companies should monitor the recycling performance of the complexes and tag or refuse pickup of loads that are contaminated. . Expand organics collection - Currently, only a few cities are offering collection of food scraps and food-soiled paper to multi-family residents.The cities and the county will need to work with the collection companies to determine what containers and collection methods will work best for multi-family complexes. Education and promotion will be a critical component of the new multi-family food scrap collection programs.A collection truck picks up garbage at a business (Photo courtesy of Waste Management) Non-Residentia I Col lection The non-residential sector comprises a range of businesses, institutions, and government entities from manufacturing to high-tech and retail to food services. This sector has achieved recycling successes in the last few years, with a recycling rate of almost 71 percent in 2014, according to Ecology statewide recycling data. Unlike the residential waste stream, the types of materials discarded by the non-residential sector differ widely from business to business. Thus, the recycling potential for any particular business or industry can vary greatly. For example, restaurants and grocers are the largest contributors of food scraps, while manufacturers may generate large quantities of plastic wrap and other packaging materials. Because of the diversity of businesses in the region, a more individualized approach is needed to increase recycling in this sector. One area with significant room for improvement is the diversion of food scraps and food-soiled paper. The largest increase will be realized as more restaurants and grocers contract with private-sector companies to collect their food scraps for composting, and more cities begin to offer embedded commercial organics collection. zotg Conprehensiue Solid 18893 Updated Aptil 17,2019 Strategies for increasing recycling in the non-residential sector present some of the same challenges as the multi- family sector, including: . The lack of consistent and/or adequate building standards for locating collection containers. . The need for financial incentives for business owners, property managers, and tenants to take advantage of recycling services. For example, cities that include recycling services in their garbage rate provide a financial incentive for businesses to recycle. . A need for consistent and ongoing technical assistance and education. lnvolvement and support of the business owners and property managers is important to the long-term success of recycling at individual businesses or complexes. Educating building maintenance staff about properly collecting recyclables from building tenants is important to ensure the proper handling of recyclables. Education for employees about proper recycling methods is also crucial. To assess the relative size of the non-residential waste stream in different jurisdictions, the division looked at the number of jobs located within them. About 94 percent of jobs in the King County service area are located within incorporated cities. More than 73 percent of these jobs are in cities where the garbage collection contracts include recyclables collection in the garbage fee, These contracts typically define the capacity required for recycling collectlon as 150 to 200 percent of the amount of garbage capacity, and target collection of the same materials as residential curbside programs. Non-residential customers have the option to take advantage of recyclables collection offered by their service provider or to contract with other collection companies that may pay for the more valuable recyclable materials, such as high-grade office paper. For cities with collection contracts, adding recycling service to their contracts and including the cost of service in the garbage rate does lead to higher non-residential recycling rates and ensure that recycling services are available to all businesses. However, while including recycling service in the rate requires all businesses to pay for the service, it does not require that those businesses use the service that the city contractor provides. Businesses in unincorporated King County and cities with UTC-regulated collection services can choose from a wide array of recycling service providers in King County for their recycling needs. Promotion of these services by the county and these cities will help increase awareness among businesses of the available options. For example, the county's \"What do I do with...?\" website (www.kingcounty.gov/ Food waste comprises a large part of the waste streanr at restaurants whatdoldowifh) is one place businesses can look for a service provider. Another strategy that might increase recycling for some business customers is to consider a rate structure based on weight or composition of waste, rather than the size of the container. A study was conducted to measure container weights for non-residential wastet'on five weekday collection routes in the City of Kirkland over a 12-month period (KCSWD et al. 2008a). This study determined that businesses with large amounts of food scraps generate garbage zotg is significantly heavier than the garbage generated by businesses without large amounts of food scraps. ln Washington, non-residential garbage rates are based on the size of the garbage container. 5o generators of heavy materials, such as food scraps, pay less than they might if the rates were based on weight, as they are in some jurisdictions across the country. Because a weight-based rate would likely cost more for generators of large amounts of food scraps, it would provide an incentive for increased participation in organics recycling programs. Another strategy is to offer organics collection to businesses at no additional cost or at rates less than garbage. Construction and Demolition Materials Collection and Recycling Construction and demolition debris is from the construction, remodeling, repair, or demolition of buildings, other structures, and roads and accounts for approximately 30 percent of all waste generated in King County. Construction and demolition debris includes clean wood, painted and treated wood, dimensional lumber, gypsum wallboard, roofing, siding, structural metal, wire, insulation, packaging materials, and concrete, asphalt, and other aggregates. The county banned the disposal of large loads of construction and demolition debris at the county-owned transfer stations and Cedar Hills landfill in 1993. ln the following years, until 2016, the division contracted with two private sector companies to manage the majority of the region's construction and demolition debris. Construction and demolition materials are typically hauled from a job site by: 1) the contractor or individual working at the job site, 2) an independent construction and demolition debris hauler permitted to handle construction and demolition debris for recycling only, or 3) a collection company permitted to haul materials for both recycling and disposal. Construction and demolition debris processing of recyclable materials occurs using either source-separated or commingled methods. Source-separated processing, which occurs particularly on large projects with adequate space, involves sorting specific types of construction and demolition material on the job site (e.9., metals, concrete, and clean wood) and transporting them to one or more recycling facilities. Commingled processing involves placing all recyclable construction and demolition debris in one container and then transporting the loads to a facility that uses mechanical and manual methods to sort the recyclable materials. Non-recyclable construction and demolition waste should be hauled directly to a construction and demolition debris transfer station where the waste is transferred to rail cars for transport to a landfill. The division does not accept construction and demolition waste at its transfer stations or Cedar Hills landfill, except for incidental amounts. King County Ordinance 18166, effective January 2016, requires that construction and demolition waste must be taken to a designated privately-operated construction and demolition debris recycling and/ or transfer facility. The division has agreements with the designated facilities that require these facilities to recycle readily recyclable materials. TheseContainer with construction and demolitiorr debris for recyclinqr's , zotg -Ju/1 zotS AttA Page 1174-35Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 facilities are banned from landfilling certain materials including: clean wood; cardboard; metal; gypsum scrap (new); and asphalt paving, bricks and concrete. All other construction and demolition waste may be disposed. As markets develop, the division will consider banning other construction and demolition materials as well. With improvements in the ability of processing facilities to separate materials, the current trend is toward the commingling of recyclable construction and demolition debris. lf recyclable construction and demolition debris and garbage are commingled, however, the recyclables are more difficult to extract and the processing facilities end up having lower facility diversion rates. These mixed loads should therefore be disposed of in their entirety. lndependent construction and demolition debris haulers with commercial permits can transport recyclable construction and demolition materials from job sites to either source-separated or commingled construction and demolition debris processors.These independent haulers cannot, however, transport construction and demolition materials for disposal. Only collection companies permitted by the UTC to haul solid waste can transport construction and demolition materials for disposal. The designated facilities listed in Table s 4-7 and 4-8 have agreements with the division and are a part of a network of designated facilities where construction and demolition materials can be recycled and/or disposed. Figure 2-4, a map in Chapter 2, shows the locations of these facilties.These facilities agree to meet criteria that the division specifies for recycling of construction and demolition materials. The division contracts with the King County Sheriff I department to provide enforcement that helps to ensure that materials are being recycled. Cities are encouraged to adopt regulations that complement the King County ordinance.The division's GreenTools program is available to provide technical assistance to cities and has a model ordinance for cities to use.

Although approved for closure under the Solid Waste Transfer and Waste Management Plan, reserve the option to retain the Renton station until the new urban transfer facilities have been completed and the impact of closure has been fully evaluated. Evaluate adding a second scale and an additional collection container at the Cedar Falls Drop Box to improve capacity.

This chapter outlines a transfer system plan that will improve current levels of service, with the flexibility to adapt to changing needs and emerging technologies. The chapter also discusses plans for effectively managing local and regional emergencies. The Transfer System and Services The concept of a regional transfer and disposal network in King County grew out of a nationwide movement in the 'l 960s to impose stricter standards for protection of public health and the environment. The original purpose of the transfer network was to replace the open, unlined community dump sites in use at the time with environmentally safe transfer facilities where garbage could be delivered by curbside collection trucks and self-haulers. From these transfer sites garbage could then be consolidated into larger loads for transport to the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill (Cedar Hills) (see Figure 5-1). Table 5-1 lists the locations of current transfer facilities, along with the tons of garbage, yard and wood waste received, numbers of customers served, and recycling services provided for at each facility.

Historically, the division's recycling programs have been limited to source separation by curbside customers. However, since 70 percent of the materials brought to the transfer stations could be recycled, sorting outtarget materials can help reach recycling goals.The division is increasing its resource recovery efforts. Based on a successful pilot project that separated tons of recyclables at the Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Station, new staffwere approved for expanded sorting of recyclables from mixed waste at the Shoreline, Bow Lake, and Enumclaw stations. Recycling bins are also provided near where self-haul customers unload their cars at those stations. ln addition to providing the standard recycling services, Bow Lake, Enumclary and Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Stations have increased the amounts of cardboard, scrap metal, and clean wood recycled by actively removing these materials from mixed waste with use of an excavator and by providing additionalstaffto engage customers in the separation of recyclables from mixed waste loads at the point of disposal. u:mbersA Transfer Station Operator recovers cardboard from a mixed load of solid waste bins, and signage in the self-haul areas resulted in the rnetal, and wood, an increase of 1,323 tons over 201 6. Services for Moderate Risk Wastes Many common household products, such as pesticides and certain cleaning products, contain ingredients that are toxic, flammable, reactive, or corrosive. Disposed improperly, these products, referred to collectively as moderate risk waste, can pose a threat to human health and the environment. Moderate risk waste generated in King County is managed through the Local Hazardous Waste Management Program (LHWMP). This program is jointly managed byTotal 1,1 60 18893 Uodated Aoril 17.2019 King County, the City of Seattle, the 37 cities within our service area, and Public Health. The guiding policies and plans are contained in the joint Local Hazardous Waste Management Plan (Watson 2010), mandated under RCW 70.105. The county accepts moderate risk waste from residents through two avenues: the traveling Wasternobile and the stationary drop-off site at the Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station. ln addition, the City of Seattle operates two moderate risk waste collection sites within its borders, which are open to all King County residents.Wastes collected through these services are recycled, reused, or incinerated when necessary. None is disposed at Cedar Hills. Moderate risk waste collection for residents is funded through a surcharge on garbage disposal, residential and business garbage collection, and wastewater discharge fees. Residents and businesses using the services are not charged at the drop-off locations. Jurisdictions receive funds from the LHWMP to provide the service. Created in 1989, the county's Wastemobile was the first program of its kind in the nation. lt is a mobile service that travels to communities within King County, staging collection of moderate risk waste at each site for two or three days at a time. The traveling Wastemobile had 21 events in 2017 that served 11,851 King County residents, collecting 272tons of moderate risk waste. This represents a customer increase of five percent from 20l6.TheWastemobile also provides a mobile moderate risk waste collection at The Outlet Collection Seattle (formerly the Supermall) in Auburn each Saturday and Sunday.ln2017, 235 tons of moderate risk waste were collected at this location from 9,481 customers, six percent more customers than used the service in 201 6. The county's Factoria Reiycling and Transfer Station offers moderate risk waste drop-off service six days a The moderate risk waste collection facility at the week. ln September 2017,the new Factoria state-of-the-art new Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station collects moderate risk waste facility opened. lt has more capacity and moderate risk waste from households and small functionality than the previous facility did, enabling the division ousrnesses to effectively and safely collect hazardous waste. ln 201 7, a little over 13,000 customers brought 281 tons of moderate risk waste to Factoria. Since 2008, Factoria and the Wastemobile have also accepted moderate risk waste from small businesses. ln 2017, this program served 267 small-quantity generator business customers and collected 18 tons of moderate risk waste. Collection of Sharps Sharps are medical products, such as hypodermic needles, scalpel blades, and lancets, which require special handling to ensure their safe collection, transfer, and disposal. Without proper containment, sharps can pose a safety hazard to workers through potential exposure to blood-borne pathogens or other disease-causing agents. Within King County, the disposal of sharps is regulated byTitle 10 of the Code of the King County Board of Health and by King County's Waste Acceptance Rule PUT 7-1-6(PR),9/17. Disposal of sharps in the general waste stream is prohibited. Separate, secure receptacles for sharps collection are provided for residents and small businesses at the Vashon Recycling and Transfer Station with prior authorization from the division's Special Waste Unit. Residents may also deposit home-generated sharps in separate, secure receptacles at the Factoria, Shoreline and Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Stations. Business-generated sharps are not accepted Solid Waste Management PIan 5-6 April 17,2019 at the transfer facilities, except at Vashon with prior authorization from the Special Waste Unit. Sharps generated by medical facilities or businesses are accepted for disposal at Cedar Hills with prior authorization from the Special Waste Unit. There are alternative methods for the proper management of sharps, For example, some health care providers and pharmacies will take back used sharps in pre-approved containers. There are also mail-in programs available. Trends in Transfer Station Usage Figure 5-2 shows the tons of garbage received at the transfer stations and the landfill over the last 27 years. The drop in total tons disposed in the early to mid-1 990s is attributable to the success of waste prevention and recycling programs that began in the late 1980s, the withdrawal of the City of Seattle from the county's system in 1991, and the ban on most construction and demolition debris from the division's solid waste system in 1993. ln 2004, the amount of garbage taken directly to Cedar Hills decreased significantly due to an increase in the fee charged to commercial collection companies that were hauling wastes directly to the landfill. The economic downturn is primarily responsible for the tonnage reduction since 2007. The division does not expect a rapid return to earlier tonnage levels. Figure 5-2. Tota1 tons processed at transfer facilities and disposed at Cedar Hills (1990 - 2017) I Transfer Facilities {S Cedar Hills Seventy-two percent of the garbage received at the transfer facilities in 2017 was brought by the larger, commercial collection trucks, with the remaining 28 percent delivered by business and residential self-haulers (shown in Figure 5-3). While the larger garbage loads come from the commercial haulers, self-haulers account for 87 percent of the customer transactions (Figure 5-3). At some of the urban stations that are operating at or near maximum capacity, the mix of self-haul and commercial customers can cause long traffic queues and crowded conditions on the tipping floor. Transfer station capacity depends on a number of variables such as the mix of collection trucks versus self- haulers, available tipping stalls for each, on-site queue capacity for each, and trailer loading ability (in the case of theI r f\\,t m $ rn \\o N @ or o f!

Percent of tons and transactions at transfer facilities by hauler type (201 7) ' tons transactions lJ Commercial haulers ffi self-haulers older stations with no preload compactors). The division has managed these problems, to the extent possible at each station, by providing separate queuing lanes for the two customer types and allowing maximum separation on the tipping floor, for safety as well as efficiency. Crowding is somewhat eased by the fact that self-haulers typically use the stations more on weekends, while commercial transactions occur primarily on week days. To understand who self-hauls to the transfer facilities and why, the division conducts periodic surveys of customers through on-site questionnaires at each facility. Self-haulers consist of single- and multi-family residents and non- residential customers, such as landscapers, small contractors, industries, offices, stores, schools, government agencies, and increasingly, independent haulers for hire. The most common type of self-hauler is the single-family resident. Of the self-haultrips, about 88 percent are made by residential customers, who bring in about 75 percent of the self- haul tons. About 12 percent of the trips are made by non-residential self-haulers, bringing about 25 percent of the self-haul tons. The number one material disposed by self-haulers is dimensional lumber (a subset of construction and demolition debris), followed by yard waste, other construction and demolition wastes, furniture, and scrap metal. The division's waste characterization studies indicate that approximately 70 percent of the materials disposed by self-haulers are recyclable. and, transfer facilities are and self-haul customers.

The most frequent response from nonresidential customers was \"large amount of garbage\" (26 percent). Evaluation and Planning for the Urban Transfer Stations The county's implementation of the Solid WasteTransfer and Waste Management Plon (Transfer Plan) is underway to renovate the aging transfer system to better serve its customers. This investment in the transfer system will help the division meet demands created by the groMh in population since Cedar Hills began accepting waste in the mid- 1960's, by technological changes in the industry, and by ongoing advances in the recycling and salvage of materials from the waste stream. The Planning Process Since 1992, continuing growth in the county and technological changes in the industry have intensified the need for significant improvements and updates to the division's infrastructure. The 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (2001 Plan) reasserted the need for an updated transfer system (KCSWD 2002). Given the scope of changes anticipated, both the cities and the county recognized the need for a more coordinated approach to the planning and decision-making process. |n2004, the County Council adopted Ordinance 14971, which prioritized evaluation of the urban transfer station network as an integral part of the waste management plan and established a process for collaborative participation by the cities in solid waste planning. Codified in KCC 10.25.1 10, Ordinance 14971 outlined an iterative process of analysis and reporting that would culminate in a plan containing recommendations for upgrading the solid waste system. The ordinance also established a forum for cities, division, and County Council staff to collaborate on solid waste planning through the advisory committees - the Solid WasteThe Algona Transfer Station was built in the mid-1 960 s Advisory Committee (SWAC) and the Metropolitan Solid Waste Management Advisory Cgmmittee (MSWMAC).The legislation also created the lnterjurisdictionalTechnical Staff Group (ITSG) to assist MSWMAC with its work. ITSG included staff representatives from the cities, County Council staff, and the division. The group was very active during the initial stages of data gathering and analysis for the planning process, but is no longer meeting. Much of the initial work was to evaluate the whole system and develop recommendations that would help inform and guide the direction of this Plan. Along with division staff, the committees first analyzed various aspects of the solid waste system through four iterative milestone reports. These reports identified the need to renovate the county's urban transfer facilities by evaluating the zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu zotS Att A Page 1335-9Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 current conditions of each facility, discussed options for public and private ownership and operation of solid waste and recycling facilities, and identified packaged alternatives for the future configuration of the transfer station network. These four milestone reports culminated in the Transfer Plan, which provides recommendations for upgrading the transfer station system and services; methods for extending the lifespan of Cedar Hills; and options for preparing the landfill for eventual closure. Through the process of analysis and reporting, the division's stakeholders had a significant role in shaping the recommendations in the Transfer Plan. At the conclusion of the process, they communicated their support of the plan to the King County Executive and the County Council. Before final approval oftheTransfer Plan, the County Council requested an independent third-party review ofthe Transfer Plan. The review was conducted by the firm Gershman, Brickner & Bratton, lnc., who fully supported the primary objectives of the plan to modernize the transfer station system and maximize the lifespan of the Cedar Hills landfill. Based on Gershman, Brickner & Bratton! review and the support of both SWAC and MSWMAC, the County Council unanimously approved the Transfer Plan in December 2007. ln2012, as the division moved to implement theTransfer Plan, several cities raised questions about how changes in core planning assumptions may callfor a change in iflhow to proceed with the replacement of the Algona, Factoria, and Houghton transfer stations. With a lower tonnage forecast than was predicted in 2006 when the Transfer Plan was agreed to, and the indication that five cities were going to exit the system in2028 resulting in an additional drop of system tonnage, it was decided to conduct a Transfer Plan Review starting in 201 3. At the end of that process, it was confirmed that a new Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station should be built and siting for a new South County Recycling and Transfer Station should continue. However, siting for a new Northeast Recycling and Transfer Station was postponed while alternative options were explored. ln 2014, Council Motion 14145 directed the division, in collaboration with stakeholders, to continue to evaluate a mix of capital facilities and operational approaches to address system needs over time, including implementing operational approaches such as transaction demand management strategies that would provide service for the northeast county without building an additional transfer station; and to compare trade-offs and benefits with the Transfer Plan. The division transmitted a final report to the County Council on June 30, 201 5 as directed by Motion 14145. The report reaffirmed that the siting process for the South County Recycling and Transfer Station should continue, but that the siting process for the Northeast Recycling and Transfer Station should be postponed. lnstead, the report recommended that the division conduct a demand management pilot to test whether instituting longer The new Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station opened in the fall of 2Q17 zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu zotS 5-10 AttA Page 134Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17, 2019 hours and peak pricing at the Factoria Transfer Station would influence customers to either use the station at different hours or to use another station. During lengthy discussions with the division, advisory committees raised numerous concerns about the demand management pilot, including its impact on service levels, traffic, and regional equity. ln 2017 , with the city of Bellevue signing the Amended and Restated Solid Waste lnterlocal Agreernenf (Amended and Restated ILA), and higher tonnage than was forecast in2014 coming into the system, the county concluded that the demand management pilot as planned would likely not be effective. County Council Ordinance 18577 and accompanying Motion 14968 canceled the demand management pilot and initiated a further planning effort for transfer capacity in the Northeast service area. The legislation allocated one million dollars to planning work to assess waste transfer capacity needs in the Northeast area of King County and options to meet these needs. lt also directs the division to plan for needed transfer station capacity in the Northeast area that would be in addition to the existing Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station. By early 2018, the remaining four cities, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Medina and Yarrow Point, also signed the Amended and Restated lLA. Service Level Evaluation Criteria ln the first milestone report (KCSWD and ITSG 2004), the division and advisory committees developed 17 criteria to evaluate the urban transfer facilities. To determine the appropriate standards of performance, the division consulted the local commercial collection companies and other experts, and applied national environmental and transportation standards. Details on the application of these evaluation criteria to individual facilities are contained in the second milestone report prepared by the division and advisory committees and approved by the County Council (KCSWD 2005a). Criteria to address costs and rate-setting considerations were applied during the development of system alternatives in the final milestone report (KCSWD 2006a). The evaluation criteria were applied to five of the six urban stations - Algona, Bow Lake, Factoria, Houghton, and Renton. The former First Northeast station was not evaluated because it was in the process of being rebuilt. The rebuilt station opened in 2008 as the Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Station. These criteria were again evaluated and confirmed as appropriate during the 2013/l4Transfer Plan Review process. They provide guidance for evaluating existing stations and designing new ones, but the facility site and other constraints may mean that new facilities do not entirely meet all criteria. For the urban station evaluations, the 1 7 criteria were grouped into three broad categories - level of service to customers, station capacity and structural integrity, and effects on surrounding communities. As expected for these five aging facilities, the majority of the criteria were not met, resulting in decisions to reconstruct or close the stations when sufficient replacement capacity was available. The three categories of evaluation criteria are described below: Level of Service . Estimated travel time to o facility -This criterion measures how conveniently located the facilities are for customers, measured by the maximum travel time to the closest facility in their service area. The standard was established as 30 minutes for at least 90 percent of the customers. lt provides an indication of whetherthe transfer stations are well dispersed throughout the county. . Time on si te - Time on site measures the time to get in and out of the station, including unloading time. lt was evaluated separately for commercial haulers (with a standard of 16 minutes) and business and residential self- zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Page '1355-11Ordinance '18893Updated April 17,2019 haulers (each with a standard of 30 minutes). lt provides an indicator of whether a transfer station can handle customers efficiently. Facility hours - lndividual days and hours of operation for each station are based on the division's usage data and customer trends. Some of the urban stations are open in the early morning or late evening hours to serve the commercial haulers. Currently, the only days that the entire system is closed are Thanksgiving, Christmas, and NewYear's Day. . Level of Recycling Services - The final criterion in this category was whether recycling services provided at the stations met the waste prevention and recycling policies established inthe 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Monagement Plan.ln general, the policies directed that all stations should 1) provide for collection of the curbside recyclables, including glass and plastic containers, tin and aluminum cans, mixed waste paper, newspaper, and cardboard, 2) where feasible, provide areas for source-separated yard waste collection, and 3) maintain the capacity to add collection of new materials based on market opportunities and community needs. Stotion Capacity Station capacity is likely the single greatest limitation of the five urban transfer stations, both now and in the future. lt was measured using a number of criteria that affect daily operations, future expansion, and emergency capacity. . Vehicle and tonnage capacity - Two major operational considerations measured were station capacity for vehicle traffic and solid waste tonnage, both at the time ofthe study and over the 20-year planning horizon. Optimal operating capacity is the maximum number of vehicles and tonnage that can be efficiently processed through the station each hour based on the station design and customer mix. To derive criteria that would indicate how well a station could be expected to perform, the division modeled its criteria after the transportation standards used Recycling at the Enumclaw Recycling and Trarrsfer statlon to measure roadway capacity. The transportation standards were modified to assign measures of capacity to transfer facilities. The optimal level of service was defined as \"able to accommodate vehicle and tonnage throughput at all times of the day, except for occasional peak hour times. Based on the criteria, a station that provides the optimal level of service more than 95 percent of the time is considered underutilized, meaning it offers more capacity than required for the area it serves. A level of service in which capacity is exceeded during only 5 to 10 percent of operating hours is considered optimal. . Space for three days' storage - Available storage capacity establishes whether a transfer station can continue to operate, or accept garbage, for at least three days in the event of a major regional disaster. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management . Space for station expansion - Stations were evaluated to determine I) whether there is space for expansion on the existing property or 2) whether the.re is adjacent land available on which to expand operations, These two standards were used primarilyto determine if the station could be expanded in its current location or if a new location would be needed to efficiently manage current and future needs. . Meets facility safety goals - While all stations hold current permits from Public Health and meet health and safety standards, overall safety is a concern as stations become more congested and operations more constricted. The presence of these physical challenges at the stations does not mean they operate in an unsafe manner; it does mean that it takes extra effort by staff and management at the stations to ensure the facilities are operating safely. . Roof clearance - This criterion measures a station's capacity to handle the larger commercial collection trucks. Through discussions with the commercial collection companies, it was determined that a minimum clearance of 25 feet was needed to allow the new, larger trucks to unload efficiently. The longer truck/trailers with automated lifts, which allow the garbage to slide out the back of the trailers, require higher vertical clearance than trucks did in the past. Before impovements were made to some of the older stations, the collection trucks could hit and potentially damage station roofs, supporting structures, or hanging lights as they unload. . Ability to compact woste -This criterion examines whether the station is equipped with, or has the space to install, a waste compactor. Waste compactors increase efficiency and reduce costs by compressing more garbage into fewer loads for transport to the landfill or other disposal option. When garbage has been compacted, transfer trailers can carry about one-third more tons per trip, resulting in less traffic, less wear on local roads, less fuel use, and a reduction in greenhouse gases. . Structural integrity -The purpose of this criterion is to ensure the facility meets code requirements for seismic, wind, and snow events. All facilities were constructed in compliance with the applicable standards of the time and were grandfathered in theircurrentcondition and presently meetthe\"life safety\"standard, meaning the station would not endanger occupants in the event of an emergency. The current standard for assessing new transfer buildings for seismic performance is the lmmediate Occupancy standard, developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This standard means that the facility could be occupied immediately following a seismic event. Becauselhe King County Emergency Management Plan identifies transfer stations as critical facilities in the event of an emergency, this FEMA standard applies to all new stations.The roof at the Houghton Transfer Station was raised in 201 2 to accommodate larger trucks zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu Updated April 17,2019 Effects on Surroun di n g Co mrnu n iti es One of the division's highest priorities is to minimize the effects of its facilities on host cities and surrounding communities.Through its advisory committees and meetings with cities, the division works to understand city and community issues and concerns and bring their perspectives to system planning. Working together, five criteria were developed to evaluate effects on communities. . Meets applicoble local noise ordinance levels - This criterion is to ensure that a facility does not violate state or local (city) standards for acceptable noise levels. State and city standards are based on maximum decibel (dBA) levels that consider zoning, land use, time of day, and other factors. Evaluations were based on the existence of any reports of noise violations to the cities and additional noise level measurements performed at each station by a consultant. . Meets Puget Sound Clean Air Agency standords for odors - The primary measure of odor issues is complaints by the public or employees. Complaints are typically reported to the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) or directly to the division. Complaints to PSCAA are verified by an inspector. lf an odor is verified and considered to be detrimental, PSCAA issues a citation to the generator of the odor. The division also tracks and investigates odor complaints. . Meetsgoalsfortrafficonlocal streets-Thiscriterion measuresthe impactson local streetsand neighborhoods from vehicle traffic and queuing near the transfer stations. The area that could be affected by traffic from self- haulers and commercial collection trucks extends from the station entrance to the surrounding streets. The division hired a consultant to evaluate this criterion based on two standards: 1) that additional traffic meets the local traffic level of service standard as defined inthe American Association of StateTransportation Officials Manual and 2) that traffic does not extend onto local streets during more than 5 percent of the station's operating hours. . Existence of a 1)}-foot buffer between the active area and nearest residence -This criterion calls for a 1O0-foot buffer between the active area ofthe station and the nearest residence. . Compatibility with surrounding land uses -The final criterion used to evaluate the stations was the most subjective and difficult to apply. lt looks at consistency with land use plans and zoning regulations, aesthetics, aind compliance with state and local regulations.This criterion was evaluated for each station during lengthy discussions between the division and its advisory committees. Since the level of service criteria were first applied to the transfer stations in 2005, the division has made changes and upgrades to the system. New recycling and transfer stations have been completed at Bow Lake and Factoria, and the roofs at Houghton, Algona and Renton were raised to meet the roof clearance standard. ln 201 7, the division applied selected criteria to the transfer stations again, using the current system conditions and an updated tonnage forecast. Table 5-2 presents the updated results for criteria that could be affected by these changes. Although the Shoreline station was not part of the original analysis, it is included in the update for reference. 5-14 zotg Comprehenslue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jub zotS Page 138Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Table 5-2.

Activities approved by the County Council in the Transfer Plan include the following: Bow Lake - deconstruct the existing transfer station and construct a new recycling and transfer station on the existing site and adjacent property - complete, Factoria - deconstruct the existing transfer station and construct a new recycling and transfer station on the existing site and adjacent property - complete, Algona - close the station after it is replaced by a new recycling and transfer station in the South County area - site selected, Houghton - close the station when replacement capacity is available at a new Northeast recycling and transfer station, and Renton - close the station when replacement capacity is available. Although approved for closure, this Plan recommends reserving the option to retain the Renton station in some capacity, should its closure leave Renton and surrounding rural areas underserved. After the new transfer stations have been completed, the impact of closure can be fully evaluated. Table 5-3 shows the planned changes for the urban transfer stations and the two areas identified for construction of new stations. The new Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Station is located on the site of the old Bow LakeTransfer Station and on adjacent property purchased from the Washington State Department of Transportation. During construction, the facility remained open to commercial haulers and self-haulers. The new transfer building opened in July 2012, immediately followed by deconstruction of the old transfer building to make way for an expanded recyclables collection area and new scale house. The station was completed in 2013. The new Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station was built on the existing site and adjacent property purchased by the division for construction of the new facility. The old station remained open as the new transfer building was constructed. Once the new building was complete, the old building was deconstructed to make room for the stationary moderate risk waste facility and recyclables collection area. The new facility was completed in late 201 7, cost approximately 90 million dollars, and will not be expanded on the upper Eastgate Way property near the Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station per Ordinance 18577 and accompanying Motion 14968. A new South County station, estimated to cost about 1 13 million dollars, will replace the current facility in Algona on a site just north of the existing station. A new Northeast Recycling and Transfer Station is recommended, with an estimated cost of approximately 1 33 million in 2017 dollars. lnitial planning for Northeast area transfer capacity is underway with more substantive work toward a new Northeast Recycling and Transfer Station anticipated after Plan approval in 2019. All new stations will be built to similar standards of service and sustainability as the Bow Lake, Factoria, and Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Stations. There will be differences to accommodate community needs (e.g., Factoria retained a stationary moderate risk waste facility), and each station will be appropriately sized and designed to meet tonnage and customer requirements. All stations will have improved capacity, waste compactors, and additional space for collection of recyclable materials. The capacity to accept yard waste and other recyclables from commercial collection companies and to sort and remove recyclables from mixed loads will also be considered for new transfer facilities. For each new station, the division will seek the highest appropriate environmental certification as mandated by the County Green Building Cedar Hills2017 Newcaslle lssaquah Renton 1 965 2012LakeFigure 5-4.

Table 5-3.Timeline for the facility renovation plan 1 Division recommends reserving the option to retain the Renton Transfer Station in some capacity. Tra nsfer Faci I ity Siti ng As described earlier in this chapter, the need for new transfer facilities was identified through a comprehensive analysis of the transfer system network, with extensive involvement from the division's advisory committees. While general areas for site locations were identified (Figure 5-4), specific sites or specific site selection criteria were not. The siting of a transfer facility is based on the technical requirements of operations and site constraints, such as site size and shape; however, a successful siting effort must also be tailored to address the needs and concerns of the service area communities. Many of the already renovated stations were rebuilt on the same site that the old station was built on in part due to the challenges finding a suitable site in the urban area. The siting process involves a number of steps - from development of site selection criteria to final selection of a site - and public involvement plays an important role each step of the way. The following section describes how the division implemented the standards and practices developed for transfer station siting during the planning process in its search for a new south county facility site. A similar process adapted to the needs of Northeast area communities will be used to site a new northeast county facility. Siting a New South County Recycling and Transfer Station The search for a site to replace the Algona Transfer Station with a new South County Recycling and Transfer Station began in 2012. The new station will serve the same communities that are served by the current Algona station - Algona, Auburn, FederalWay, and Pacific. A Siting Advisory Committee (SAC) was formed to advise the division from a community and system-user perspective by identifying community concerns and impacts, developing criteria used to evaluate potential sites, and expressing opinions and preferences. SAC members included representatives from cities, local agencies and businesses, chambers of commerce, school districts, commercialgarbage and recycling collection companies, transfer station users, environmental and neighborhood groups, tribes, and interested citizens. zotg close Northea$ design and permit construction planning siting open Houghton close April 17,2019 ln addition to forming a SAC, the division worked to ensure that members of the communities to be served by the new station were aware of the project, were able to receive information about the project, and had opportunities to give input on the project. Public information effortsto non-English speaking communities included translating public information materials into Spanish, Russian, and Korean and providing translators at public meetings. ln addition, the division conducted an initial Equity lmpact Review (see text box for more information) to provide more information about the communities surrounding the potential sites. After an extensive site selection process and the completion of an Environmental lmpact Statement (ElS), the County selected a site at 35101 West Valley Highway South, Algona, WA which is just north of the existing station. As indicated in Table 5-3, the next phase of this project, design and permitting, will be undertaken in the next two years, followed by another two years of construction. lt is anticipated that the existing Algona Transfer Station will continue to operate until the new station is complete. At that point, the old station will close. Up-to-date information about the South County Recycling and Transfer Station project can be found on the division's website: www.kingcounty.gov/ d e pt s/ d n r p /s o I i d -wa st e/fa c i I i ti e s/a I g o n a.a s px, The Equity lmpact Review The Equity and Social Justice Strategic Plon 201 6-2022 201 6b) establishes a goal to\"Develop facility and system improvements responsive to the values and priorities of r,esidents and stakeholders and achieve pro-equity outcomes.\"The purpose of the Equity lmpact Review is to fulfill that goal and to ensure that equity impacts are considered during the siting, design, a'nd operation of a new facility. lt is a process to identify, evaluate, and communicate the potential impacts on equity - both positive and negative - of the project. There are five phases of the Equity lmpact Review which correspond to the d,ifferent stages of the project. For instance, an initial Equity lmpact Review was conducted during the siting of the South County Recycling and Transfer Station. The review determined the populations that would likely be impacted by the project and what the impacts might be. An expanded Equity lrnpact Review that will address approaches that will best meet community priorities and concerns w,ill be an integ,ral part of the design and operation of the facility. Providing Transfer Capacity in the Northeast Service Area As early as the 1992 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan, the Houghton Transfer Station was identified as being in need of replacement. Throughout the years, subsequent evaluations and studies, including the Transfer Plan, confirmed the need for a new station and the closure of the old one. The existing Houghton station was constructed in the mid-1960s on 8.4 acres of land. The station is bordered by the closed Houghton landfill on the north side, Bridle Trails State Park on the south side, and private homes on the east and west sides. The station has an open-sided, direct-dump style transfer building, a scalehouse, a modestly-sized no-fee recyclables collection area for a limited range of materials, and trailer parking areas. A New Northeast Recycling and Transfer Station is Recommended Although previous plans recommended a new station, a Northeast station decision was not finalized, offering the opportunity to re-evaluate transfer needs as part of this plan. County Ordinance 18577 directed that this plan \". .. must address current waste transfer needs in the Northeast area of King County and how those needs are proposed to be met.\" The Public Review Draft Plan issued in January 2018 identified three options to meet Northeast area eotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan needs: 1) Houghton station t'asisi2) site and build a new Northeast recycling and transfer station, and 3) a combination of existing and/or new facilities. After public comment and careful consideration of the three options, the option to site and build a new Northeast recycling and transfer station is recommended, with the Houghton station to be closed after the new station is complete. The location, services offered, and financial and transportation impacts to the community are components of providing regional equity in transfer services in the Northeast service area. A new station will provide similar services in the Northeast service area that updated transfer stations in other urban service areas now provide. The Northeast area is among the fastest growing parts of the county and was the third busiest station in terms of both tons and transactions in 201 7. A new station will meet key levels of service to accommodate current and future tons and vehicles, both on a daily basis and when emergencies require extra storage. lt would include compaction which could decrease truck traffic from the station to the landfill by almost a third. lt would be designed to move customers through the station efficiently, reducing customer disposal time. lt also would allow for full service recycling to help meet county goals. A new station is the highest cost option, but its costs are in line with the cost of modern stations recently built in other parts of the urban area. Siting a new station could take time and generate host community opposition. lnitial planning for Northeast area transfer capacity is underway with more substantive work toward a new Northeast Recycling and Transfer Station anticipated after Plan approval in 2019. The divlsion will use experience gained in siting the South County Recycling and Transfer Station to refine its approach to understanding capacity needs, evaluating potential sites, and involving the community. Criteria for any facility that might ultimately be built in the Northeast service area would be developed with members of that community. A first step in this process will be a dialogue to understand the needs and concerns ofall ofthe stakeholders in the northeast service area. Other Northeast Capacity Options Considered The Houghton station \"as is\" and a combination of facilities, described below, were considered as options in the Public Review Draft Comp Plan, but are not recommended as the best way to provide transfer capacity in the Northeast service area. Keep Existing Houghton Station Open This option would keep the existing station open indefinitely and largely in its current condition. This option is the \"no action\" or status quo alternative to addressing transfer capacity in the Northeast service area. lt would be the least expensive option but would continue to provide lower levels of service for the Northeast compared to other urban parts of the County system. Recycling options would be limited, compaction to reduce truck traffic would not be available, and there would not be enough space to efficiently accommodate the future tons and numbers of customers. Host city concerns about continued operation of the open sided station adjacent to a residential neighborhood would continue. Co mbi n atio n of Faci I iti es This option would use a combination of facilities to meet transfer capacity needs based on expected population and employment growth, transportation corridors and other criteria to determine the types and sizes of transfer stations needed to serve the area. lt would consider various combinations of facilities to meet transfer capacity needs. For example, one combination that was used to develop the comparison in Table 5-4 would be to leave the existing Houghton Transfer Station open to serve only self-haulers and site and build a separate facility elsewhere in the service area to serve commercial haulers. Although this option could meet more level of service targets than the Houghton station alone, it carries some of the challenges of both the Houghton \"as is\"option (continued open sided station, limited space) and the new NE station option (siting a new facility, potential host community opposition). zotg Comprebetzsiue Solid Waste Managenent Plan -Jufu 144Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Table 5-4 Comparison of key characteristics of three transfer options considered 1 Costindudesbothcapitalandoperating(osts.Previousestimates0fcostpert0nandimpactonthecurbsiderateonlyincludedcapitalcosts 2 Using WARM model, calculates the GHG reduced by recycling at the station 3 Keylevelofservicerriteria:Iimeonsite,Rerydingservicesoffered,Vehidecapacity,Averagedailyhandlingcapacity(tons),Sparefor3daysstorage,andAbilityto compa(t waste Evaluation and Planning for the RuralTransfer Facilities Historically, the rural areas were served by small community landfills. As those landfills closed, most were replaced by either a transfer station or a drop box. The Duvall and Hobart (near Maple Valley) landfills were closed without replacement.

Because the drop boxes are essentially collection containers covered by roof structures, there is no building per se to evaluate, so many of the criteria did not apply. Criteria specific to the rural system were not developed because a preliminary look indicated that the rural facilities, for the most part, met the standards set for the urban system, although they may be open for fewer hours and days. To provide an appropriate level of service to area residents and the commercial collectors, the division periodically reviews the operating hours of rural facilities and makes adjustments as needed. The Enumclaw Recycling and Transfer Station, which opened in 1993, serves the City of Enumclaw and southeastern King County. The City of Enumclaw provides its own garbage collection service and takes the wastes to the transfer station. The station offers a wide variety of recycling opportunities and is equipped with a waste compactor. This station met all of the evaluation criteria, with the capacity to provide a wide range of services and the flexibility to respond to future needs. The Vashon Recycling and Transfer Station opened in 1 999 to serve residents and businesses on Vashon lsland. This station also met all of the evaluation criteria. lt accepts a wide range of recyclables and is also equipped with a waste compactor. Because of its remote island location, the facility accepts some construction and demolition materials and special wastes for disposal that the other stations do not. The division partnered with Zero Waste Vashon, a community group focused on finding practical ways to recycle waste, to conduct a pilot program to collect yard waste mixed with food waste. The program started in October 2015 and was made permanent in 2016. The division will continue to partner with Zero Waste Vashon to find solutions to managing lsland waste in a cost effective and environmentally appropriate fashion. The drop boxes are scaled-down facilities, designed to provide cost-effective, convenient drop-off services in the more remote areas of the county.The Cedar Falls Drop Box, which opened in 1990, serves self-haulers in the North Bend area. lt has three containers - two for garbage and one for yard waste - and provides a collection area for some recyclables. This facility met all applicable evaluation criteria except for vehicle capacity, which is primarily due to heavy weekend use. Currently, the same scale is used by both inbound and outbound traffic, which can lead to backups on weekends when the station is most busy. The division is considering a number of improvements to this facility, including a second scale to address heavy weekend use, another container for garbage or yard waste collection, and expanded recycling opportunities. The most remote facility operated by the division is a drop box in the Town of Skykomish. Built in 1980, the drop box serves Skykomish and the communities of Grotto and Baring. Skykomish provides its own garbage collection service and takes the wastes to the Skykomish Drop Box. The drop box is also used by self-haulers, who can bring garbage and recyclables to the facility. The Skykomish facility is unstaffed; payment is made at an automated gate using a credit or debit card or pre-paid solid waste disposalcard.There are cameras at the site to monitor activities, and division staff makes regular visits to the site to perform maintenance. ln addition, the King County Road Services Division has a facility The Skykomish Drop Box zotg Comprebensiue So/id Waste Page 146Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 next door, from which Road's staff help monitor the site. The drop box met all the applicable evaluation criteria and appears to provide an appropriate level of service for the area. The facility received a new roof in 2008, after the old roof collapsed under record snowfall in January of that year. 5ome rural area customers may be affected by changes to the urban transfer system, primarily self-haulers who currently use the Houghton or Renton transfer stations. When a new urban facility is ultimately sited in the Northeast service area, the facility location may or may not adequately meet the service needs of rural areas. Should it be necessary, the division may consider siting drop box facilities to serve residents. Construction of regional transfer stations in these rural areas is not being considered. The division recommends deferring decisions about whether to site drop boxes in these potentially underserved areas and whether to close the Renton transfer station until after the new urban transfer stations have been completed and the impact on service capacity has been fully evaluated. City Mitigation Transfer stations provide an essential and beneficial public service. However, the stations have the potential to cause undesirable impacts on host cities and neighboring communities, such as increased litter, odor, noise, road/curb damage, and traffic, as well as aesthetic impacts. The division works to mitigate these impacts in a number of ways, such as collecting litter, landscaping on and around the site, limiting waste kept on-site overnight to reduce the potential for odor, making road modifications, and siting facilities on or near major roadways to keep traffic off local streets. Seven cities in the division's service area currently have county-owned transfer facilities within their boundaries: . Algona - the Algona Transfer Station,. Bellevue - the Factoria Recycling and Transfer Station,. Enumclaw - the Enumclaw Recycling and Transfer Station,. Kirkland - the HoughtonTransfer Station,. Renton - the Renton Transfer Station,. Shoreline - the Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Station, and. Tukwila - the Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Station. As new transfer stations are constructed in the near future, the division will work with host and neighboring cities to build stations that are compatible with the surrounding community. For example, during the design of the Shoreline Recycling and Transfer Station, the division worked closely with the community to identify impacts and mitigation measures. One result is that transfer trailers drive directly from the station onto lnterstate 5 using King County Metro Transit's dedicated freeway ramps rather than city streets for access. ln addition, sidewalks on nearby streets were improved; a new walking path was constructed at nearby Ronald Bog Park; trees were planted; and the portion of Thornton Creek that flows through the site underwent significant restoration. The transfer building was also moved farther from residences and is fully enclosed to mitigate impacts from noise, odor, and dust. The division has also worked closely with the City of Bellevue on the replacement of the Factoria Transfer Station. The initial plan was for a new facility to be constructed on property that fronts lnterstate 90 adjacent to the south side of the old station. However, as a result of discussions with Bellevue, the division purchased adjacent property to the northwest of the old station to complete the new facility. The Amended and Restated ILA (included in its entirety in Appendix C) identifies the roles and responsibilities of the county and the cities in the regional solid waste system. The county agrees to collaborate with host and neighboring cities on both environmental review and project permitting. Additionally, the Amended and Restated ILA zotg Conprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 zot9 Att A Page 1475-23Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17 ,2019 recognizes that, in accordance with RCW 36.58.080, a city is authorized to charge counties to mitigate impacts directly attributable to a county-owned solid waste facility. lt must be established that such charges are reasonably necessary to lessen or eliminate impacts and the revenue generated may only be used for impact-mitigation purposes. Direct impacts may include wear and tear on infrastructure, including roads. The city and county will work cooperatively to determine the extent of the impacts and appropriate mitigation payments and will document any agreement. Mitigation, including any necessary analysis, is a cost of the solid waste system and as such would need to be included in the solid waste rate. Transfer Services after an Emergency Relatively common emergencies, such as seasonal flooding and winter storms, as well as major events, such as earthquakes, can create a significant amount ofdebris. Debris generated during these types ofevents can obstruct roadways, cause power outages, and interrupt essential services. A coordinated and effective plan ensures that debris is properly managed to lessen the impacts on communities, the economy, and the environment in the immediate aftermath of an emergency without causing additional problems later in recovery. To this end, the division prepared the King County Operational Disaster Debris Management Plan (Debris Management PIanXKCSWD 2009) for unincorporated King County. The Debris Management Plan is intended to facilitate rapid response and recovery efforts during a disaster. The Debris Management Plan will be reviewed periodically, prior to the storm season, and updated as needed. The Debris Management Plan supports the 37 incorporated cities that are part of the King County solid waste system with a framework and recommendations that can be used by the cities to develop their own operational disaster debris management plans. The cities have the flexibility to develop a debris management plan that best addresses their individual needs without compromising continuity within the county. Several cities have now adopted individual plans. The City of Seattle has its own debris management plan and the City of Milton is participating in Pierce County's debris management program. The county's Debris Management Plan stipulates that during emergency response and recovery, the roles within the King County solid waste system do not change. This means that the division will continue to accept municipal solid waste at the transfer stations to the extent possible and will maximize recycling in accordance with RCW 70.95.010 (8) and KCC Title 10. The transfer facilities will not be used for disposal of disaster debris that could be recycled. The debris created by a larger event, such as an earthquake, would likely consist primarily of recyclable materials, such as concrete, metal, and wood. The division's Debris Management Plan is coordinated with emergency plans prepared by other jurisdictions to maximize the recycling of these materials.The division works with the King County Regional Communications and Emergency Coordination Center (RCECC) and the Local Hazardous Waste Management Program to coordinate public information and help cities and residents identifi recycling options in the event of a debris- causing emergency. Recycling the majority of emergency debris will maximize the division's capacity to continue to handle municipal solid waste over the short- and long-term. ln the event of an emergency, transfer services may be suspended in the short-term. The division's priorities are to: i. Ensure the safety of staff and customers, 2. Confirm the structural integrity of facilities and environmental control systems, 3. Coordinate with the RCECC to determine any immediate needs for division staff or equipment, and 4. Resume service. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management P[an -Jufu zotS 5-24 AttA Page 148Updated April 17 ,2019 Ordinance 18893 The division will maximize the use of existing transfer facilities after an emergency through operational measures suchasincreasedstaffingorhours. lfsometransferfacilitiesareclosedordamagedasaresultofthe event, customers will be rerouted to remaining stations, and commercial haulers may be routed directly to Cedar Hills landfill Additionally, the division and the cities may establish temporary debris management sites where debris can be stored until it can be sorted for recycling or proper disposal. lt is recommended that potential sites in unincorporated King County and in cities be identified by each jurisdiction in advance of an emergency. The acceptance policies at these sites would be determined in response to the nature of the event and the debris that is generated. Processi ng Col lected Materials Processing Comming led Recyclables The division expects that the private sector will continue to expand processing capacity for commingled recyclables as the need arises. ln addition, numerous other private-sector facilities have emerged across the county where individual residents and businesses can bring source-separated recyclables, from paper, cans, and bottles to printer cartridges and cellular telephones, for processing. While the conversion to commingled collection makes recycling easier for consumers and has resulted in increased recycling, it presents some challenges for the recovery and processing facilities. One of the challenges is cross- contamination of materials as they are sorted and separated. This is a problem particularly for the paper stream, where materials such as plastic milk jugs end up in the baled paper. Plastic bags sometimes catch in and jam the sorting machinery at materials recovery facilities, and they can blow around and cause litter problems. Paper mills overseas typically perform additional sorting of the materials to recover misplaced recyclables; however, most domestic paper mills disposeSorting line at the Cascade Recycling Center (Photo courtesy of Waste Management) of these materials. ln the case of glass, even small amounts of contamination in the sorted material can reduce the quality and affect the potential end use of the recycled glass.These problems illustrate a fundamental conflict between the benefits of commingled recycling (it makes collection easier and leads to increased recycling) and the need for the materials recovery facilities and end users to minimize the costs of handling these materials. For the processing of commingled recyclables to be most efficient, it is important that consumers are careful about preventing contamination in the recycled loads by: 1) preparing recyclables for the collection cart (i.e., rinsing out bottles and jars, breaking down cardboard boxes) and 2) placing materials in the proper collection container 3) closing container lids to keep rnaterials dry. Contamination in the recyclables can cause a wide array of problems during processing, which can lead to a reduction in the value of the materials processed for market or, in extreme zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 zotB 5-25 Att A Page 149Updated Aptil 17 ,2019 Ordinance 18893 cases, the disposal of entire mixed loads. This issue can best be remedied through education programs on proper recycling techniques offered through local governments and the collection companies. See Chapter 4 for a discussion of issues regarding markets. As the region moves forward, the recommended'role of the county and cities is to focus on increasing the supply and improving the quality of recyclable materials delivered to processors. The value of materials for recycling can be maximized through public education - to decrease contamination in the recycling stream and ensure that materials are properly prepared before being placed in the recycling container - and through market development - by encouraging businesses to invest in technologies used to sort and process recyclables. There are materials that present unique challenges or require more definitive decisions about the optimal way to process them, such as container glass, food-contaminated paper, compostable and degradable plastic, plastic bag and film, plastic caps, poly-coated paper, and shredded paper.The division, along with several cities, has participated in the Northwest Region Commingled Workgroup to identify key issues with commingled collection and processing and to develop recommendations for addressing them.The division will be working with the cities, the collection companies, and processors to determine which of these recommendations will be implemented in King County. Processing Organics Organic waste (yard, wood and food waste) represents the largest recyclable commodity that is landfilled - 320,000 tons, rnore than a third of the total tons disposed at Cedar Hills landfill. Diverting these materials is key to meeting our goals. Currently composting is the primary processing option for these materials in the region. The volume of organics that is currently collected from King County businesses and residents for recycling is close to exceeding the regional permitted capacity for such processing. The current amount of recycled organics represents 90 percent of the region's processing capacity. Table 5-5. Regional compost facilities zotg Waste Management P[an -July zotSCity TOTAL Jurisdiction King 257,829 177,315 65,800 500,944 Grove: Pl Everett, WA521 553,000 Tons Per Yedr 250,000 228,0002017 Summary of organics recycled by region 2018 Surnmary of organics permitted capacity by processor 5-26 Att A Page 150Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 There is only one facility in King County permitted to handle food waste. Relying on one large regional facility that is operating near its maximum permitted capacity is a concern, especially if the region wants to increase the amount of organics that are recycled instead of being disposed. This facility is pursuing operational changes to help mitigate odor concerns, and continues to be the subject of community odor complaints. One reason that capacity is constrained in the region is because organics cannot be transported to Central/Eastern Washington for new processing capacity because of the Washington State Apple Maggot Quarantine regulations (RCW 1 7.24). Maintaining the quality of finished product is critical to compost markets, and processing challenges include: . Contamination of composting feedstocks, pa rticularly from glass and plastic film. . Composting feedstocks are in transition. Regional commercial facilities were largely designed for yard waste, not the mix of food, yard, and compostable packaging that is collected and processed today. A need exists for upgraded technology to manage the new material mix. . Processors have expressed a desire to better anticipate the future feedstock mix, noting a Cedar Grove Composting Facility (Photo courtesy of Cedar Grove) need for better information on volumes and incoming materials to inform investments in capacity, equipment, and labor. . Financing for technology upgrades at existing facilities. . Composters report that market prices and sales for compost products have been stable. However, maintaining the quality of finished product is key to maintaining adequate market demand for compost; processors must balance the costs of adding processing steps (such as for additional contaminant removal) with maintaining competitive market prices for finished product. lf organics diversion significantly increases in King County and the surrounding region, more processing capacity will be needed. ln order to significantly increase diversion of organic materials that are disposed from single and multi-family homes and businesses, a regional dialogue with exploration of alternatives and solutions for expanding capacity is necessary.This will help minimize environmental and community impacts related to regional organics processing and ensure an adequate capacity and infrastructure is in place for regional organics processing, including contingency plans in the event regional capacity is constrained. A range of options should be pursued to address organics recycling capacity including continued organics and soils education to promote the recycling and use of organics on landscapes, market development such as local buy-back programs, the pursuit of new technologies and additional private or public infrastructure development. zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan -Jufu zot8 April 17, 2019 Ordinance 18893 Emergi ng Processing Technologies Resource recovery goes beyond sorting to include technologies such as anaerobic digestion, advanced materials recovery, pyrolysis, and gasification. Most of these technologies hold promise for the future but do not yet have extensive track records in reliably handling the amount of waste in King County's system. A brief discussion of anaerobic digestion and advanced materials recoveryfollows. For a discussion on pyrolysis and gasification, see Chapter 6, Landfill Management ond Solid Waste Disposal. Anaerobic Digestion ln 2016, the division hired HDR Engineering to evaluate options for adding anaerobic digestion to regional organics processing (KCSWD 2017b). Anaerobic digestion is a biological process that transforms organic waste into renewable energy, and in some situations, a useable residual by-product. HDR evaluated anaerobic digestion technologies using both source-separated organics with minimal contamination, and municipal solid waste containing approximately one third organic waste. The division required HDR to focus on local conditions, feedstocks, and markets. While the study does not identify a clear role for anaerobic digestion in the county's solid waste system, it does recommend further research into several small-scale anaerobic digestion options for source-separated organics, with varying levels of public and private sector collaboration. For instance, with grant money from the division, a small- scale anaerobic digester is being piloted on Vashon lsland. Source-separated organics-based anaerobic digestion solutions are currently more affordable and more reliable than municipal solid waste-based systems. As a feedstock, municipal solid waste typically benefits greatly from advanced pre-processing, which is costly and currently has mixed success rates. Currently, source-separated organics in King County are managed by private-sector companies, and do not even come to the county's transfer stations. However, source- separated organics are likely the best feedstock for successful anaerobic digestion based on minimal contamination which lowers pre-processing costs, eases the anaerobic digestion process, and results in a marketable organic by-product.Example of a small anaerobic digester in Redmond (Photo courtesy of Impact BioEnergy, lnc.) Advanced Materials Recovery Advanced materials recovery as it is envisioned at the county recycling and transfer stations would involve both floor sorting of recyclables by division staff and installing some mechanical sorting systems at select facilities (most likely Bow Lake, the new south station, and any other new stations). An additional consideration might be a separate advanced materials recovery facility (public, private, or a partnership) capable of processing sufficient mixed waste to reach a 70 percent recycling rate for the county. This alternative would reach recycling goals more quickly than waste prevention would, as it relies less on changes in customer behavior. However, feasible system configurations and cost effectiveness are not yet known and would require more study, including a cost benefit analysis. zotg Comprehensiue So/id Waste Aptil17,2019 Ordinance 18893Ordinance 18893Updated April 17 ,2019 Operate and maintain the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill to meet or exceed the highest federal, state, and local standards for protection of public health and the environment.

Finally, it addresses how past disposal sites - closed landfills - are managed. Current Disposal at the Cedar Hills l-andfill For more than 50 years, King County has relied on the Cedar Hills landfill as a local means of cost-effective solid waste disposal. Although another disposal method will ultimately be needed, the county has used several approaches to maximize value for ratepayers and extend the landfillt life beyond the 2012 closure date predicted in the 2001 Comprehensive Solid Waste Management PIan. Since 2001, new practices and policies have made better use of landfill space, new capacity has been built, the tons going to the landfill have been reduced, and studies have identified opportunities to further develop Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity through the planning horizon of this Plan. The So/id Waste Transfer and Waste Manogement P/an (Transfer Plan), approved by the County Council in December 2007, included the following recommendation:Updated April '17, 2019 Ordinance 18893 \"Explore opportunities for taking advantage of available landfill capacity to extend the life of this cost-effective disposal option; revise the Cedar Hills Site Development Plan and seek to maximize the capacity (lifespan) of the landfill, subject to environmental constraints, relative costs to operate, and sta keholder interests.\" To implement the Transfer Plan recommendation, the division is pursuing three primary strategies to extend landfill life: . Diversion of waste, . Operational efficiencies, and . New area development. These three strategies seek to extend the life of the landfill by increasing landfill capacity and density, which are defined as follows: . Landfill capacity -the amount of space, often referred to as airspace, which is permitted and available for disposal of waste. Landfill capacity is calculated based on the height, footprint, and slopes of the landfill. . Density - how tightly materials are packed together, in this case solid waste in the landfill. A higher density means more waste packed into a given amount of space. The density of solid waste within the landfill is a function of both operational practices, the types of waste, and natural processes. Density is increased as waste is compacted by heavy machinery on the face of the landfill and by the natural settling that occurs over time as solid waste decomposes. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste 1576-1Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Diversion of Waste Reducing the amount of waste delivered to the landfill (waste diversion) is the most effective strategy for extending landfill life. The division will continue to practice current methods of waste diversion and may implement further strategies, as discussed below and in more detail in Chapter 4, Sustainable Materials Management. Current Strategies for Waste Diversion Waste is currently diverted from Cedar Hills through two primary methods - waste prevention and recycling and a ban on the acceptance of most construction and demolition debris. Waste prevention and recycling efforts have proven a successful strategyfor extending the life of the landfill. During a 2}-year period, an estimated 1 0 million tons of materials that would otherwise have been disposed in the landfill were recycled, extending the landfillt life by approximately 10 years, Banning most construction and demolition debris from Cedar Hills has also contributed to extending landfill life. Since the disposal ban went into effect in1994, an estimated 4 million tons of construction and demolition debris has been diverted from the landfill (see Chapter 4 , Sustainable Materials Managementfor more information about construction and demolition debris recycling and disposal). Potential Strategies for Waste Diversion The division will continue to consider diverting a portion of the solid waste stream to another recycling, recovery, or disposal option(s) while the landfill is still in operation. However, a cost-benefit analysis, including a comparative analysis of greenhouse gas emissions, would precede any decision to pursue early diversion because the cost of adding a new disposal method to the cost of operating Cedar Hills may outweigh the benefits of extending landfill life. Possible diversion options include waste conversion technologies such as anaerobic digestion, demonstration projects of other evolving technologies that promote resource recovery, or exporting some waste to an out-of-county landfill. Environmental, social, economic, and other criteria also would play into any waste diversion decision. Cperationa i E1-frciencies The division has made a series of operational changes to increase landfill capacity and density. These changes include reducing the amount of soil and rock buried in the landfill, using more efficient unloading and compaction equipment, and taking advantage of natural settlement. Some of the key changes and efficiencies achieved are described below: The division has implemented strategies to minimize the placement of soil in the landfill. For example, in the past, six inches of compacted soil was used to cover the entire surface of the active solid waste disposal area at the end of each working day. Daily cover serves to control litter and discourage foraging by animals, such as rodents and birds. However, the use of soil consumes valuable landfill space.The division now uses retractable tarps to cover most of the waste at the end of each day to reduce the amount of soil buried in the landfill. The tarps serve the same function as daily soil cover. At the start of each day's operations, the tarps are rolled up, and more solid waste is placed directly on top of the previous day's waste. Soil is still used to cover side slope areas. However, as much of this soil as possible is removed before more waste is placed, and the soil is then reused.Together, these practices have resulted in a reduction of the volume of soil buried in the landfill. zotg Comprehensiue So/id Ordinance 18893 Tippers now empty trailers and containers rather than the walking floor trailers previously used. Walking floor trailers require a large, rock covered surface for the trucks to drive on as the walking floor rolls the garbage out the back of the trailer. These large rock surfaces are not required with the tippers. lnstead, the garbage trailers are backed onto the tipper, which tilts the trailer, allowing the garbage to slide out ofthe back and into the refuse area. The use of tippers not only reduces the use of rock, it also decreases unloading time for each trailer by at least half, and reduces damage to equipment and tires.f iopers empty trailers more effrciently Heavier equipment and improved methods have increased waste compaction. Packing the waste to a greater density allows more airspace for additional solid waste in each landfill area. Another strategy for increasing landfill capacity is taking advantage of the natural settlement that occurs as waste placed in each area decomposes. As this natural settling occurs, the level of the landfill drops below the permitted height, allowing more waste to be added to bring the height of a previously filled area back up to its planned level.To take advantage of this natural settlement, the division has delayed final closure of Areas 5 and 6, and will delay final closure of Area 7, to allow settling to occur so that additional waste can be added before final cover is applied. With these operational changes, more solid waste can be placed within the already designed and permitted refuse areas. The division will continue to pursue these and other best management practices that preserve airspace and make more efficient use of landfill capacity. The division will also work with subject matter experts to determine best practices related to use of top lifts and temporary covers, including how long temporary covers should be used prior to applying final cover. The division will provide a report on the best practices with implementing actions to the King County Council no later than April 1,2020. New Area Development During 2009 and 2010, the division explored alternatives for developing new refuse areas to extend the landfill life. A wide range of alternatives was originally identified. Based on a preliminary assessment of operational and engineering feasibility, as well as likely environmental impacts, five action alternatives were developed that would extend landfill life for an additional th ree to 13 years beyond the then projected closure date. The environmental impacts of these alternatives were evaluated in an environmental impact statement (ElS), with the Final El5 issued in July 2010. The EIS determined that none of the five action alternatives would result in any significant unavoidable adverse environmental impacts compared with the no action alternative (KCSWD 2010a). The preferred alternative from the Final ElS develops 56.5 acres for a new Area 8 in the southwestern portion of the landfill and extends landfill life for eight to nine years. lt maximizes the use of readily available space at the landfill, with the least amount of disruption to existing landfill structures. Garbage shall not be disposed of, nor soils be stockpiled, within 1,000 feet of the property line at the landfill, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. At the same time, this alternative preserves the flexibility to implement further development should it be necessary in the future and balances the cost of future development and operatlons with savinqs to April '17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Developing a new area requires extensive excavation and preparation Permitted Pla The table below presents current and planned 20'17.lI is based on a:n air spaceutilization of consumed, and an average yearly tons yard is the airspace utilization achieved in Area 7 usage, and rock recovery).

The selection is needed to provide substantial lead time to complete fi nancial, operational, and infrastructure preparations, including completion of environmental review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). Interlocal agreements also require the county to consult with partner cities at least seven years before Cedar Hills closes, triggering a consultation in 2021 if no new Cedar Hills capacity is built. For these reasons, selecting a disposal option as part of approval of this Plan is essential to ensure there is no gap in the divisionl ability to dispose of waste and meet contractual obligations. Further Development of Cedar Hills is Recommended For the Public Review Draft Plan issued in January 2018, the division used information from the ConversionTechnology Report (R.W. Beck 2007), the Waste-to-Energy Study (Normandeau 2017), and an updated Cedar Hills Site Development Alternatives Finol Report (KCSWD 2017a) to identify three options to meet the county's disposal needs after currently permitted capacity at Cedar Hills is used: 1) Further develop Cedar Hills, 2) waste export, and 3) waste to energy (mass burn) facility. After public comment and careful consideration of the three disposal options, the option to further develop the Cedar Hills Landfl is recommended. This recommendation willfurther develop Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity, extending the division's over 50- year practice of managing its waste locally. The increased capacity shall not all result in either disposal of garbage or stockpiling of soils within 1,000 feet of the property line at the landfill, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement, but will develop new cells within the existing footprint of the landfill and increase the height from the permitted 800 feet up to 830 feet, only to the extent that such activity would be consistent with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, which requires King County to make a good faith effort to keep the maximum height of areas 5, 6, and 7 of the Landfill at or below 788 feet above sea level. Based on the 2018 tonnage forecast, maximizing the development of the landfll should extend capacity through the planning horizon of this Plan. Landfl life could be extended if recycling increases, recessions occur, or more complex development approaches are used. To account for emerging technologies, the next disposal option after Cedar Hills is not specifed in this Plan, but would be evaluated in collaboration with regional partners prior to the next Plan update to ensure no gap in service. The recommended further development is consistent with county policy to maximize the life of the Cedar Hills landfill. The Conversion Technology Reporf (R.W. Beck 2007) and more recent division analysis concluded that Cedar Hills disposal is the most economical way to handle King County's waste. Other advantages include the division's experience in landfbperation, availability of space in a county-owned landfill with state of the art environmental controls, and collection of landfll gas to produce renewable energy. Developing Cedar Hills to the maximum extent feasible has the lowest rate impact of the three options considered, the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and the lowest risk because of long-term experience in its operation. Other benefits include that waste created in King County will continue to be managed locally, the division will maintain control over the system, and landfll gas will continue to be delivered to the Bio-Energy Washington facility, resulting in pipeline-quality natural gas, revenue for the division, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Table 6-1 includes a comparison of key attributes of the three options. To reduce impacts on neighboring communities, King County shall implement a bird management plan. zotg Comprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan Ordinance 18893 Table 6-1 .

Those options are not recommended as the next disposal option after current permitted Cedar Hills capacity (Area 8) is used in2028, but could be undertaken after an expanded Cedar Hills ultimately closes. This plan does not consider the option of developing a replacement landfill either in King County or in another county, in keeping with policy established in the 2001 Plan. Conditions in King County such as land availability, environmental considerations, public acceptance, cost, and other issues would impede any effort to site a replacement landfill in the county. ln addition, there are existing landfills outside of King County with significant capacity available. Waste Export This option would export waste via railto an out-of-county landfill after permitted capacity at Cedar Hills is used by 2028. Waste export by rail is a proven disposal option used by neighboring jurisdictions, including the City of Seattle and 5nohomish County.There are several regional landfills available by rail with combined capacity sufficient to handle the county's waste in the long term (KCSWD 20'l 7c). This option would transfer a significant portion of the County's waste management activities into the private sector for long haul and landfilling. This option is not recommended as the next disposal option after 2028 for several reasons. lt has higher costs than further development of the Cedar Hills landfill. lt requires modifying transfer stations for rail-ready transport, division operational changes, and requires sufficient lead time for contracting for services. The Waste Export option would require all of the county's waste to be exported on trains. According to the Washington State Freight Rail Plan, it is unclear if the freight rail system will have adequate rail capacity by 2028 (Normandeau 2017) lo accommodate all of the county's waste. ln addition, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation 2014\"Landslide Mitigation Action Plani rail service can be disrupted by landslides and flooding. lf service interruptions stretch from days to weeks, unsanitary conditions could occur at transfer stations and eventually in the neighborhoods where collection services must be stopped. Scarce rail capacity and service disruptions could increase costs and require robust contingency planning. Waste to Energy Facility Under this option, all of the region's municipal solid waste would be directed to a waste to energy facility built in King County when current permitted capacity at Cedar Hills is reached by 2028. As discussed previously, a recent study identified a mass burn facility as the best waste to energy technology for consideration by King County (Normandeau 2017), Mass burn facilities operate successfully in many parts of the U.S. and the world. To handle the county's projected tonnage, the facility would require approximately a 40 acre site and be designed to handle 5,000 tons-per-day so that it could operate 20 years before further disposal capacity is needed. After 20 years, an added/expanded waste to energy facility or other disposal method would be required. A waste to energy facility would reduce waste to ash 90 percent by volume and 75 percent by weight, while offsetting some costs through the sale of electricity and increasing recycling by as much as two percent by recovering metals after the waste is burned. Non-processable, bypass waste, and ash would be transported to an out-of-county landfill by rail.This option is not recommended as the next disposal option after 2028 for several reasons. lt has the highest cost of the options considered, it requires guaranteed amounts of consistent feedstock, has potential for inefficient operation in early years when less capacity is used, and it has the highest greenhouse gas emissions of the options considered. As with waste export, rail capacity constraints could disrupt export of ash and bypass waste. At 5,000 tons per day, the facility would be among the largest in the world with associated implementation and siting risks. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu zotS Att A Page 1636-7Updated April17,2019 Next Steps Several actions will need to be taken in order to further develop the Cedar Hills Landfill beyond its current permitted capacity.The following steps are needed at Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity: . Move facilities currently located at the landfi ll that are on areas permitted for refuse disposal. . Revise the Proiect Program Plan (KCSWD 2010b) and Cedar Hills Site Development Alternatives Final Report (KCSWD 2017a) for the-develofment of Cedar Hills and conduct a new SEPA environmental review, since increasing the height of the landfi ll up to 830 feet was not considered in the 2010 ElS (KCSWD 2010a).. Apply to Public Health - Seattle and King County for a permit modifi cation to allow the landfi llto be expanded up to 830 /eet in heioht onlv to the extent thaisuch niodificition would be consistent with the terms and conbitions of the Settlement Agieemerlt, which requires King County to make a good faith effort to keep the maximum height of areas 5, 6, and 7 ofthe Landfill at or below 788 feet above sea level.. Develop new landfi ll cells.. While Cedar Hills exoansion is underwav. the reqion will need to review the latest technoloqical advances and take those into account during the next Plari Lpdate\"to properly evaluate disposal options for th1 ultimate closure of Cedar Hills. Given the longer life of the facility, King County will develop and implement a bird management plan for the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill. The bird management plan shall include at least the following elements: . An inventory of birds at least seagull-sized or larger that inhabit the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill, including species and number of birds, to be updated annually;. Design suggestions to minimize attractiveness of the site to birds;. A description of proposed bird control methods including equipment, construction activities, permits required (including federal and state fish and wildlife permits), and other operation and maintenance requirements related to bird control;. Description of staff resources and training needed to implement the control plan thoroughly and completely;. Performance metrics related to bird management; and. Amonitoringplanto,onatleastanannual basis,assesstheefficacyofthebirdmanagementplanandallowfurther adaptation and improvement of the plan. lt will also provide a basis for determining if bird use of the area changes through time. ln recognition of the longer life of the landfill and to ensure transparency of landfill operations, the solid waste division shall transmit to the council each year the annual report submitted to the local health jurisdiction and the department of ecology, as required byWAC 173-351-200 (11), as amended. Even with further development, Cedar Hills landfill capacity will ultimately be exhausted and a new disposal option will be needed. The next disposal option is not specified in this plan so that the latest technological advances can be considered when the choice is made. The Transfer Plan suggested that one disposal option - waste export - is best evaluated within 5 years of initiating service to ensure decisions consider current market conditions. Other disposal options such as waste to energy likely require a longer lead time. Although the Amended and Restated lnterlocal Agreement requires consultation with cities at least seven years before Cedar Hills closes, evaluation of the next disposal option should begin prior to the next Plan update to ensure enough time for method selection, planning, and implementation. Factors in a Long-Term D,isposal Method ln cooperation comrnittees, the division identified several cr.iteria be used in disposa,loption particularly importarit that disposal options are consistent commitment of its partner cities to Zero Waste of Resources by 2030. Any option also must be increases in population, housing, and solid waste tonnage, as well asthe specific composition of King waste. The 2018 tonnage forecast projects solid waste tons increasing to 1,275,0A0 tons by 2028 and continuing to g,row, reaching 1,564,000 tons in 2040. This forecast assurnes that the region's recycling rate remains at 52 percent, King County's Office of Performance, Strategy and Budget will engage with the Solid Waste Division and the regional partners to develop a plan tor long-term disposal, to be recommended to the King County Executive, who will transmit legislation to the King County Council implementing the neK long-terrn disposal metllod. The Executive will transmit a progress report that outlines how this plan will be developed, including timing for development and transmittal of this plan, to the Council by Decem'ber 31 ,2021 . :ot9 Conzprehetzsiue Solid A Page 164Updated April17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Screening and Evaluation Criteria for Disposal Options The division, in collaboration with, its advisory committees, has developed criteria by which disposal options rnay be screened and evaluated when making future decisions.

Hundreds of companies are forming, developing new methods, obtaining patents, and improving waste conversion technology systems. Many universities, consultants, and organizations are conducting studies and producing eotg Conzprehensiue Solid Waste Managenrcnt Plan -Jztj Page 165Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Terms Waste conversion technologies ale non-incineration technologies that use thermal, chemical, or biological processes, sometimes combined with mechanical processes, to convert the unrecycled portion of the municipal solid waste stream to electricity fuels, and/or chemicals that can be used by industry. reports, and partnerships are forming to fund, build, and operate facilities. Meanwhile, jurisdictions are undertaking rule-making efforts to define terms and establish regulations that both facilitate the development of sustainable technologies and protect the environment and the public. Waste conversion technologies are also now being defined separately from incineration, e.g., \"Waste conversion technologies are non-incineration technologies that are used to convert the non-recyclable portion of the municipal solid waste stream to electricity, fuels, and/or industrial chemical feedstocks\" (SWANA 201 1). Waste conversion technologies use thermal, biological, or chemical processes that are sometimes combined with mechanical processes.Technologies using a thermal process include pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma arc gasification. Hydrolysis/fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and aerobic composting use biological processes. Depolymerization uses a chemical process. The feedstock used by waste conversion technology systems can be municipal solid waste; selected materials removed from municipal solid waste, such as organics; or municipal solid waste combined with sewage sludge. Each system has unique requirements regarding the types, size, and amount of feedstock processed per day. Below is a sampling of conversion technologies, as described by Jeremy K. O'Brien of the Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA 201 1). These technologies are not currently considered to have the capability to reliably and cost-effectively handle all the materials in the regional system. Gasification is a commercially proven manufacturing process that converts such hydrocarbons as coal, petroleum coke, biomass (such as wood and agricultural crops or wastes) and other organics to a synthesis gas (syngas), which can be further processed to produce chemicals, fertilizers, liquid fuels, hydrogen, and electricity. ln a gasification facility, hydrocarbon feedstock is injected with air or oxygen and steam into a high- temperature, pressurized reactor until the chemical bonds of the feedstock are broken. The resulting reaction produces the syngas. The syngas is then cleansed to remove such impurities as sulfur, mercury particulates, and trace minerals. So/id Waste Managenzent 18893 Pyrolysis is a process that involves the thermal decomposition of feedstock at high temperatures (750'F-1,500'F) in the absence of air. The resulting end product is a mixture of solids (char), liquids (oxygenated oils), and gases (methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide). The oils and fuel gases can be used directly as boiler fuel or refined for higher-quality uses such as engine fuels, chemicals, adhesives, and other products. The solid residue contains most of the inorganic portion of the feedstock as well as large amounts of solid carbon or char. Plasma arc gasification technology is a heating method that can be used in both pyrolysis and gasification systems. This technology was developed for the metals industry in the late nineteenth century. Plasma arc technology uses very high temperatures (7,000'F) to break down the feedstock into elemental by-products. When municipal solid waste is processed, the intense heat actually breaks up the molecular structure of the organic material to produce such simpler gaseous molecules as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.The inorganic material is vitrified to form a glassy residue. Anaerobic digestion is the bacterial breakdown of organics in the absence of oxygen. lt can occur over a wide temperature range from 50'F to I60\"F. Anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste can occur naturally, as in a landfill, or in a controlled environment, such as a municipal solid waste anaerobic digestion facility. ln the latter, municipal solid waste is first processed for removal of inorganic and recyclable components, reduced in size, and then placed in an airtight vessel called a digester, where the process occurs. Biogas is one of the by-products of anaerobic digestion facility and it can be used as fuel for engines, gas turbines, fuel cells, boilers, and industrial heaters. lt can also be used in other processes and in the manufacture of chemicals. Anaerobic digestion would be a good option when the food waste is separated at its source from other wastes. The division is committed to the continued exploration of these and other emerging technologies. ln addition, the division is monitoring changing definitions, legislation and regulations, companies, and partnerships. Disposal of Special Wastes Most of the waste delivered to the division's facilities is municipal solid waste (garbage) from residential and non- residential sources. A portion of the waste stream, however, requires special handling and waste clearance before disposal because of legal, environmental, public health, or operational concerns. Of the approximately 800,000 to 1 million tons of solid waste disposed each year, between 6,000 and 9,000 tons is designated as special waste. These special items include industrial wastes; asbestos-containing materials; off-specification, recalled, or expired treatment plant grit and vactor wastes; and other miscellaneous materials. lt does not include moderate risk wastes. The division continues to educate customers on the county's waste acceptance policies through public outreach materials and hands-on customer service. Since 1993, the division has conducted a waste screening program to ensure that materials in the waste stream are handled in accordance with federal and state regulations (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Title 40, Subtitle D and WAC 1 73-351). Under this program, waste screening technicians, in cooperation with other staff, perform random manual and visual screening of incoming loads of waste at each transfer facility and at Cedar Hills to identify and properly manage any potentially unacceptable wastes. About 1 1,000 loads of waste are screened at division facilities each year. Waste screening, combined with ongoing surveillance and control of incoming solid waste by transfer station and landfill operations staff, is a significant step in the county's solid waste enforcement program. ln cases where special waste policies are repeatedly disregarded, division staff enforces compliance through a progressive process of warnings, citations, and eventually fines for improper disposal of special wastes. zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management Plan -July zotB Att 1676-11Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Under the county's Waste Clearance Policy PUT 7-2-1(PR) and Waste Acceptance Rule PUT 7-1-6(PR), the Special Waste Unit provides a free service to customers to evaluate wastes and determine if they can be accepted for disposal and under what conditions. Special waste staff process and provide more than 400 waste clearances for disposal each year. Conditions for disposal could include wetting to control dust, bagging, hauling directly to the Cedar Hills landfill, specific packaging and labeling requirements, separation from other waste in a special waste disposal area, or certification of disposal by authorized landfill staff. Procedures for disposal of special waste are often defined by local, state, or federal regulation. The method for handling special wastes once the Cedar Hills landfill closes will be considered during the evaluation of alternative disposal options. Managing lllegal Dumping and Litter Managing municipal solid waste that is dumped on open ground is one of the division's responsibilities. lllegal dumping and litter can cause environmental contamination and pose both safety hazards and risks to public health. Addressing the issue of illegal dumping requires several coordinated programs and the participation of many county departments, the cities, and other agencies. The division manages or participates in programs that strive not only to reduce littering and illegal dumping on public and private property, but also to assist its victims. lllegal dumping lllegal dumping is a continuing problem for agencies, businesses, and the general public who find yard waste, appliances, car bodies, and other wastes dumped on their personal property, on public property, and on road rights of way. The division continues to lead the implementation of recommendations made in 2004by a county task force charged with strengthening and coordinating the county's response to illegal dumping complaints. ln 2008, the County Council adopted an ordinance to refine the county's role in enforcing laws that prohibit illegal dumping on public and private lands. The ordinance enhances the county's authority to cite and prosecute illegal dumpers. For example, it allows the county to charge a restitution fee to illegal dumpers and, in turn, provide monetary relief to victims of the illegal dumping.The fee can be waived if the illegal dumper cleans up and properly disposes of the waste. Coordinating illegal dumping reporting and response through the lllegal Dumping Hotline (206-296-5ITE) is a major element in the county's surveillance and control system for illegaldumping. Regional responsibilities for illegal dumping enforcement, clean up, and prevention are identified in Table 6-2. Clean-up of an 9 Ordinance 18893 Table 6-2. lllegal dumping clean-up responsibilities The division also developed a program called the Community Cleanup Assistance Program, which enables environmental site inspectors from the county, cities, and other agencies to issue free disposal vouchers to property owners who are victims of illegal dumping. Community Litter Cleanup The division's Community Litter Cleanup Program, funded in part by a grant from Ecology, supports the cleanup of litter and illegal dumpsites on public lands and waterways in King County.The program also supports prevention and education, through advertising, signage, and other measures. ln 2016,litter crews cleaned up over 1 76 tons of debris from 151 sites. About 1 7 percent of the debris - including items such as tires, appliances, and junk vehicles - was recycled. Secure Your Load ln accordance with state laW since 1994 the division has assessed a fee to the drivers of vehicles with unsecured loads arriving at its staffed transfer facilities and landfill. An unsecured load has not been fastened in or attached to the vehicle with tarps, rope, straps, netting, or chains, so as to prevent any part of the load or the covering from becoming loose, detached, or leaving the vehicle while it is moving.Washington State Department of kologyProvides Local Solid Waste Financial Assistance - Community Litter (leanup Program funding for cleanup to local agencies.

The requirement to secure loads is in the ?u/es of the Road\" (RCW 46.61 .655), which is enforced by the Washington State Patrol. State law (RCW 70.93.097) and King County Code (Title 10.12.040) require the division to charge an unsecured-load fee, which is assessed by scale operators. ln 2006, the division launched the Secure Your Load outreach program to raise public awareness of the importance of securing loads. The division has worked closely with the King County Sheriff's Office and the Washington State Patrol to enforce the law, and with Ecology and the Maria Federici Foundation to raise public awareness. ln 2013,to strengthen its deterrent effect, the fee for an unsecured load arriving at a division facility was raised to 525. Division staff have received training from the Washington State Patrol to help them accurately identify unsecured loads and uniformly assess the fee.The increased fee for unsecured loads supports safe, clean communities. Disposal Services after an Emergency fhe King County Operational Disaster Debris Management Plon (Debris Management PIanXKCSWD 2009) outlines the process for managing disaster debris within the boundaries of unincorporated King County and for coordinating with the 37 cities with which King County has interlocal agreements.The Debris Management Plan is aligned with other national, state, and county plans, including the 2014 King County Comprehensive Emergency Management P/an, as well as regulations and policies that will affect how King County manages disaster debris. Debris management operations are grouped into three response levels - routine, medium, and high. The response level is determined by the division based on the geographic scope and impact of an actual or anticipated incident. Routine incidents are relatively common emergencies such as small landslides or minor flooding, which can be supported with existing resources and require minimal coordination. . Routine incidents are relatively common emergencies such as small landslides or minor flooding, which can be supported with existing resources and require minimal coordination. . Medium-impact incidents require more than routine coordination, and generally involve multiple jurisdictions. These include incidents such as moderate earthquakes, minor or moderate flooding in multiple locations, and storms with snory ice, and/or high winds.The situation may require mutualaid or contract resources, and it may be necessary for the King County Executive to proclaim an emergency. . High-impact incidents require a high degree of coordination and generally involve requests for state and federal assistance. These include incidents such as large earthquakes, severe flooding, or severe storms. ln most cases, an emergency will have already been proclaimed by the King County Executive. A regional approach to planning is essential for managing the multi-jurisdictional impacts of emergencies in the Puget Sound area and for coordinating the limited disposal capacity in western Washington. This disposal capacity is subject to two major constraints. First, most jurisdictions in the region export their solid waste to landfills east of the Cascade Mountains. Without local landfill space, disposal capacity relies on the regiont transportation network, which could be compromised in a major emergency. Second, the only operational landfill in King County - Cedar Hills - does not accept for disposal construction and demolition debris - the most common aftermath of high-impact incidents - only municipal solid waste, zotg Comprehensiue So/id Managetnent 170Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 The coordinated regional Debris Management Plan emphasizes recycling to the extent possible. The plan calls for the use of temporary debris management sites for storage of debris until it can be sorted for recycling or proper disposal. The division has worked with the King County Regional Communications and Emergency Coordination Center to coordinate public information and help cities and residents identify recycling options in preparation for and in response to emergency events of all types. The ability to respond after a major regional emergency is one criterion that will be used to select a disposal option to be used once the Cedar Hills landfill closes, Restoration of Closed Landfills The division is responsible for maintaining and monitoring closed landfills that were constructed under different standards than those that guide landfill development today. Depending on the year the landfill closed, a minimum maintenance and monitoring post-closure period is specified in the Washington Administrative Code, but the timeline is not definite in state law. Although most of the closed landfills have reached the end of the required minimum post-closure period, regulations and the understanding of closure requirements have changed, requiring ongoing maintenance and monitoring. See Figure 6-1 for the location of the closed landfills. Post-Closure Monitoring and Maintenance At seven of the nine closed landfills, the division routinely monitors groundwater, surface water, wastewater, and landfill gas. The Bow Lake and Corliss landfills were excavated to build new transfer stations on site, so very little, if any, waste is left and monitoring is no longer necessary. Studies are underway at the Vashon, Cedar Falls, Hobart, and Enumclaw landfills to determine what additional actions are needed for these landfills to reach a stable state. When a stable state has been reached, post-closure activities at these landfills may be reduced or terminated. Under the current monitoring program, sampling data are collected from more than 180 groundwater, surface water, and wastewater monitoring stations, and approximately 100 landfill gas monitoring stations. These data are summarized in quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Washington State Department of Ecology and Public Health. Public Health also routinely inspects all of the closed landfills. The closed landfills were constructed under different standards than those that guide landfill development today. With the exception of portions of the Vashon landfill constructed after 1989, they are unlined and do not, in some cases, incorporate all of the environmental control systems present in a modern landfill.Thus, the unique characteristics of each site - in particular the underlying geology, what lies downstream, and the waste that was originally placed in the landfill - play an important role in the post-closure needs ofthe site.These factors also influence the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the existing landfill control systems.

When the Cedar Hills landfill reaches capacity and closes, the bottom liner, capped top, and extensive gas and water control systems will inhibit releases to the environment for many years. Applicable regulations will define the minimum post-closure period (currently 30 years). Landfill closure is guided by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Title 40, Subtitle D Part 258, Subpart F - Closure and Post-Closure Care, as well as Washington Administrative Code 173-351. The post-closure period may be shortened or lengthened based on the perceived risk to human health and the environment. After the post-closure period, there is expected to be some reduced level of monitoring and care to ensure the integrity of the cap and other environmental controls. Beneficial Reuse of Landfill Properties The county continues to examine possibilities for the beneficial reuse of closed landfill properties. While the presence of landfill control systems at these landfills can limit the types of beneficial reuse projects that can be implemented, such as at the Enumclaw landfill, the county has been successful in converting several properties wholly or in part to new purposes, Future beneficial uses also could create revenue opportunities. Houghton landfill - Athletic fields were developed on the former Houghton landfill area. Hobart landfill - Model airplane enthusiasts and an astronomy club use the open spaces of the Hobart landfill. Duvall landfill -The county installed an 800-MHz radio tower outside of the refuse boundary of the Duvall landfill as part of its Emergency Communications Project. Cedar Falls, Duvall, and Puyallup/Kit Corner landfills - Walking and cycling trails in the property buffers are used by area communities. Other beneficial uses The open spaces at closed landfills, often grassy areas surrounded by woods, provide habitat for diverse species of plants and animals. Closed landfills that currently provide homes to healthy populations of wildlife are Cedar Falls, Duvall, Hobart, Houghton, Puyallup/Kit Corner, and Vashon. Grass covers have been placed over all the landfills, engineered to suit the naturally occurring features and areas of potential enhancement at the properties. Vegetative covers at the Duvall and Puyallup/Kit Corner properties include planted trees andVeqetative cover at the Duvall landfill zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste PIan 173Ordinance 18893Updated April 17,2019 other vegetation to improve ground cover and water quality, as well as perches and nesting boxes for hawks and owls. The Cedar Falls and Duvall landfills are near the headwaters of large streams and provide cover and a source of food for birds, deer, coyote, and other woodland animals. Managing these properties as green space helps support the county's goals and policies for habitat preservation and increases carbon sequestration (i.e., reduces the total carbon emissions) at the properties. Finding reuse opportunities for the closed landfill properties provides continued benefit to the surrounding communities, but the uses need to be compatible with the ongoing environmental monitoring at the sites. The division continues to explore beneficial reuse options for closed landfills, such as alternative energy farms (solar and wind) and sustainable forestry. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management PIan Att A Page 176Ordinance 18893Updated April 17, 2019 Keep tipping fees as low as reasonable, while covering the costs of effectively managing the system, protecting the environment, encouraging recycling and providing service to customers.Policies AttAPagelTTOrdinance 18893Updated April 17,2019 The following table includes a menu of recommended actions that the county and the cities should implement.

This chapter first provides a brief summary of the division's financial structure, including descriptions of funding sources, revenues, and expenditures The remainder of the chapter describes a range of influences expected to have a financial impact on the division in the future. Funding of Solid Waste Services and Programs King County's solid waste transfer and disposal system is a public-sector operation that is funded almost entirely by fees collected from its customers. The division is an enterprise fund, managing nearly all of its expenses with revenues earned through these fees. The fees charged at county facilities, called tipping fees, pay for the operation and maintenance of transfer and disposal facilities and equipment, education and promotion related to waste prevention and recycling, grants to cities to support waste prevention and recycling efforts, and administrative operating expenses and overhead. Tipping fees also pay for the construction of transfer facilities. Bonds or loans may be used for large projects, but repayment of this debt is funded by tipping fees. As discussed later in this chapter, through transfers into reserve funds, the fee paid for each ton of waste entering the system today covers the expenses involved in disposal of that waste, even if some costs are incurred decades in the future. Using this financial structure ensures that the full cost of solid waste handling is paid by the users of the system. A summary of the fund structure is illustrated in Figure 7-1 and discussed in the following sections. Customers pay a tipping fee at the scalehouse zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Platz -Ju$ zotB AttA Page 1817-1{ IN Figure 7-1. Solid Waste Division fund structure + + +og J 0, oo Solid Waste FundsUpdated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 How Cities Fund Solid Waste Programs Cities fund their solid waste and waste prevention and recycling programs in a variety of ways, and the resources available to the 37 cities,in the King County systern vary widely. Some cities receive revenue from fees paid for solid waste collection services. These fees may be paid directly to the city or to the collection company depending on who provides the collection service - the city itself or a commercia,l collection company - and what contractual arrangements have been made. ln sorne cases, the collection companies cha,rge a fee that is passed on to the city to fund their Solid Waste Division Revenues As mentioned earlier, the solid waste system is funded primarily by the tipping fees charged at division facilities, The tipping fee is charged to the commercial collection companies that collect materials curbside and to residential and business self-haulers who bring wastes to the transfer facilities themselves. ln accordance with KCC 10.08.040, the County Council establishes the fees charged at county solid waste facilities. There are four main types of tipping fees: Basic Fee - The per-ton fee charged to customers disposing of municipal solid waste at transfer facilities and to curbside collection vehicles at the Cedar Hills landfill. The basic fee accounts for about 97 percent of tipping fee revenues. Regional Direct Fee - A discounted fee charged to commercial collection companies that haul solid waste to Cedar Hills in transfer trailers from their own transfer stations and processing facilities, thus bypassing county transfer stations. Yard Waste and Clean Wood Fee - A fee for separated yard waste and clean wood delivered to facilities that have separate collection areas for these materials. SpecialWaste Fee - The fee charged for certain materials that require special handling, record keeping, or both, such as asbestos-containing materials and contaminated soil. There are two different special waste fees that reflect the greater or lesser expense involved in handling and tracking different materials. Other fees are charged for recyclables, such as appliances. KCC 10.1 2.021 .G authorizes the division director to set fees for recyclable materials for which no fee has yet been established by ordinance. These fees may be set to encourage recycling and need not recover the full cost of handling and processing. ln accordance with state law (RCW 70.93.097), the division also charges a fee to vehicles with unsecured loads arriving at any staffed King County transfer facility or the Cedar Hills landfill. FigureT-2 shows the breakdown of revenues as projected for 2017 and2018 in the 2016 Rate Study. As shown, about 90 percent of the division's revenue comes from tipping fees.The remainder of the division's revenue comes from a zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Manageznent Plan -Juj zotB Att A Page 1837-3Updated April 17,20'19 Ordinance 18893 few additional sources. The most significant of those is the Local Hazardous Waste Management Program (LHWMP). Other sources of revenue include revenue from the sale of landfill gas from the Cedar Hills landfill; interest earned on fund balances; recyclables revenue, including revenue from both the sale of scrap metals received at division transfer facilities and from a fee on recyclables collected in unincorporated areas; fees collected from construction and demolition disposal; income from rental properties; fees collected on unincorporated area curbside accounts to support waste prevention and recycling education; and Washington State Department of Ecology grants to help clean up litter and illegal dumping throughout the county, as well as to support waste prevention and recycling. Based on economic and market conditions, revenues from these sources and interest earned can vary considerably.

For Sustaina ble Materials Manage 184Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Solid Waste Division Expenditures Division expenditures, can be divided into four broad categories: operating costs, support service costs, debt service, and transfers to other solid waste funds. The division maintains a target fund balance - an average balance in the Operating Fund sufficient to cover 30 days ofdirect operating expenses. Operating expenses are defined to exclude reserve funds. A rate stabilization reserve allows the accrual of funds to smooth out rate increases over time. Figure 7-3 uses 2017-2018 projections to illustrate the various division expenditures, which are described in the following sections: Figure 7 -3. 2017 Budgeted expenditures ffi Operating Costs I Other Solid Waste Funds I oeft Services O SupportServices Operating Costs Operating costs, which constitute the majority of all division spending, include the day-to-day expenses for transfer, transport, and landfill operations, maintenance of equipment and facilities, and management of landfill gas and wastewater. Operating costs also include business and occupation tax, and an emergency contingency to cover some costs related to weather-related events or other small emergencies. ln addition, all but one of the closed landfills have met the obligatory number of years of post-closure care, but have on-going needs for monitoring and maintenance. Since the post-closure period has expired and maintenance and monitoring is still required, those projects are now funded by the Operating Fund. Also included in the operating costs category is the rent that the division pays to the county's General Fund for use of the landfill property. Rent is based on a fair market property appraisal. An appraisal Murray & Associates in 2012 determined a rent payment schedule for 2015 through 2025. Also included in operation costs are mitigation paid to cities for impacts directly attributable to solid waste facilities (RCW 36.58,080) as well as other mitigation related to construction or other activities as required by federal, state, and local regulations and permits. Similar to the cities' authorization to receive mitigation, and due to the longer life of the Landfill, the Road Services Division of the Department of Local Services will study the ability to charge the Solid Waste Division to mitigate impacts directly attributable to the regional facility, including wear and tear on nearby roads. Another expense in this category is recycling costs. This includes grants to the cities and other waste prevention and recycling programs and services provided by the division. AttA Page 1857-5Updated April 17, 201 9 Ordinance 18893 Support Service Costs This cost category includes functions that support operations, such as engineering, overhead, finance, administration, and planning. Debt Service Debt service is the payment of interest and principal on bonds and loans. Major transfer facility capital projects are generally financed by a combination of general obligation (GO) bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the county's General Fund and rate dollars in the Construction Fund. lt is anticipated that with approval of the County Council, GO bonds will be issued for future transfer facility capital projects. Repayment of the debt will not extend beyond, and may be less than, the useful life of the facility. Additional factors that may be considered include but are not limited to: changes in disposal method, length of the lLA, bond market/bond rates, and waste generation. To date, Cedar Hills landfill capital projects are not funded through debt financing, but through the Landfill Reserve Fund discussed later in this section. Transfers to Other Solid Waste Funds Transfers from the Operating Fund to reserve funds make up a portion of the division's costs. These reserve funds were established to ensure that the division can meet future obligations, or expenses, some of which are mandated by law. Contributions to reserve funds are routinely evaluated to ensure they are adequate to meet short- and long- term needs. Paying into reserve funds stabilizes the impact on rates for certain expenses by spreading the costs over a longer time period, and ensures that customers who use the system pay the entire cost of disposal. The three reserve funds - the Capital Equipment Recovery Program Fund, the Landfill Reserve Fund, and the Post-Closure Maintenance Fund - are discussed below. Bond proceeds and contributions from the Operating Fund to the Construction Fund are used to finance new construction and major maintenance of division transfer facilities and some closed landfill mitigation projects. Contributions from the Operating Fund to the Construction Fund result in less borrowing, and consequently, a lower level of debt service. The Capital Equipment Recovery Program Fund (CERP) is codified in KCC 4A.200.680.The purpose of the CERP is to provide adequate resources for replacement and major maintenance of solid waste rolling stock (primarily long-haul trucks and trailers) and stationary compactors. New equipment is purchased from the Operating Fund, but after the initial purchase, replacements are funded from the CERP. By accumulating funds in the CERB the division is able to cover the expense of replacing needed equipment without impacting rates, even while revenue fluctuates. Annual contributions to the CERP are calculated by projecting future replacement costs, salvage values, and equipment life. Contributions are adjusted to reflect changes in facilities and operations that affect equipment needs. The contributions are held in an account, earning interest, until needed. The CERP Fund provides resources for replacement and major maintenance of eq uipment The Landfill Reserve Fund (LRF), codified in KCC 4A.200.390, covers the costs of four major accounts maintained for the Cedar Hills landfill, which are described on the following page: zotg Contprehezzsiue So/id April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 . New area development account - Covers the costs for planning, designing, permitting, and building new disposal areas.. Facility improvements account - Covers a wide range of capital investments required to sustain the infrastructure and operations at the landfill, such as enhancements to the landfill gas and wastewater systems.. Closure account - Covers the cost of closing operating areas within the landfill that have reached capacity. Mandated by federal and state law, these contributions help the division prepare incrementally for the cost of final closure of the entire landfill.. Post-closure maintenance account - Accumulates funds to pay for post-closure maintenance of the Cedar Hills landfill for 30 years. This account is also mandated by federal and state law The sum of all four accounts, based on projected cost obligations, makes up the LRF contribution from the Operating Fund. Projected cost obligations are based on the current plan for the landfill. When Cedar Hills closes, the division will discontinue its contributions to the LRF. After final closure, the balance of the LRF will be transferred to the Post- Closure Maintenance Fund to pay for Cedar Hills'post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The Post-Closure Maintenance Fund, codified in KCC 44.200.7'l 0, is a separate fund that pays for the maintenance and environmental monitoring of theVashon landfill- the only closed landfillthat is still within the regulatory period set in 40 CFR 258.61 and Washington Administrative Code 173-351-600 (see Chapter 6, Landfill Management and Solid Waste Disposal). ln addition to the funds mentioned above, the division is investigating the establishment of an Environmental Reserve, as discussed in the Amended and Restated lLA.The purpose ofsuch a fund would be to help to pay for any environmental liabilities not already covered by system rates or insurance. The fund would be retained for a minimum of 30 years following the closure of the Cedar Hills Landfill. Target Fund Balance The division's current practice is to retain an average balance in the operating fund sufficient to cover at least 30 days of direct operating costs' A stormwater pond at the cedar Hills Lanclfi ll is part of the Minimum Rate Stabilization Reserv\" infrastructure paid for by the Facility lmprovements Account FCS Group conducted a rate structure analysis (KCSWD 2017d), and reported that the division suffered an 1 1 percent reduction in Basic Fee revenue over a two-year period during the Great Recession. For comparison, during the more moderate 2001 Dot-Com Bust, Basic Fee revenue decreased by four percent in that two-year period. To mitigate the risks associated with a moderate-level economic recession, holding five percent of annual revenues as a minimum Rate Stabilization Reserve balance would provide for a moderate-level recession slightly more severe than the Dot-Com Bust, but not for an outlier like the Great Recession. Preparing for two years of reduced revenues fits with the County's two-year budgeting cycle. Presumably, the Council would be able to pass any needed recession response measures within two years, and the division would not need to carry excessive reserves. The division is developing specific procedures for maintaining recession reserve monies to include access to and replenishment of funds. zotg Conprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan AttA Page 1B77-7Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 lnfluences on Future Costs and Revenue ln addition to the unanticipated increases or reductions in tonnage due to the economy, there are other factors that can be expected to influence costs and revenues.These factors, which can be projected and budgeted for with varying degrees of certainty, are summarized below. lnterest Earnings The division's reserve funds are invested to earn interest during the years, or even decades, before the funds are needed. This is particularly significant for the long-term Landfill Reserve Fund, which will finance landfill closure and 30 years of post-closure care, a period expected to run from about 2028 (the currently approved capacity) through 2058, or if expanded capacity is approved, for about 30 years after Cedar Hills reaches its maximum disposal capacity, making interest earnings a considerable factor in the amount that needs to be put aside. ln 2013, the value of interest earned was less than inflation. Starting in 2018, a small increase in interest above inflation is expected through 2026. The county is looking at how the funds might be invested differently consistent with County guidelines to earn a higher rate of return. Waste Prevention and Recycling As discussed earlier, revenues from garbage tipping fees cover the costs of waste prevention and recycling services and programs.This financing structure requires the division to estimate the effects of waste prevention and recycling on garbage disposal to reasonably project future revenues. While the revenue stream relies primarily on garbage tipping fees, the current priorities in solid waste management are waste prevention and recycling, which lead to reductions in the amount of solid waste disposed and therefore in revenues received. The reduction in the amount of waste received due to waste prevention, recycling and product stewardship has been gradual, and the system has adjusted to lower revenues. Further reductions through increasingly rigorous waste prevention and recycling efforts will continue to affect the revenues of King County and other jurisdictions across the state. The state's Moving Washington Beyond Waste and Toxics, 201 5 Update recognizes that, \"Local governments in particular are concerned about how to sustain funding for programs when the goal is to reduce waste disposal, the source of most funding\" (Ecology 2015). The county completed a Sustainable Solid Waste Management Study (KCSWD 2014a) that looked at multiple strategies, technologies and services that the division could employ to increase recycling and manage solid waste. One of the strategies suggested by the study is to develop a sustainable financing modelthat is aligned with waste prevention and recycling (KCSWD 2014a). lncreased waste prevention and recycling efforts have had positive influences on the financial aspects ofthe system as well. As discussed in Chapters 4 and 6, waste prevention and recycling have contributed to extending the life of the Cedar Hills landfill, which will save money for ratepayers. Another aspect of waste prevention and recycling that has had a positive financial effect is product stewardship. Product stewardship shifts the management of materials at the end of their life to the product manufacturer.This shift reduces the costs to cities and counties of managing products such as televisions, computers, and fluorescent bulbs and tubes, to name a few. The savings are most substantial for products that contain hazardous materials and are more difficult and expensive to manage within the public collection, transfer, and disposal system. zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jufu zo8 188Updated April 17,2019 Ordinance 18893 Cperatiana I [fhcicr]cies The division continually seeks to eliminate waste and variability in its operations. This commitment ensures the division's ability to provide value to its customers, while improving the quality of service, controlling costs, and upholding the county's environmental goals. Examples of operational efficiencies that are producing significant and long-term results are discussed briefl y below. LandfillTippers The division uses tippers to empty garbage from transfer trailers at the landfill. The tippers Landfill tippers are an efftcient \\^/ay to ernpty r.ransfer trailei's replaced the use of older walking floor trailers (see Chapter 5, Landfill Management and Solid Waste Disposal, for more details). Tippers save staff time and other resources, as well as reduce equipment and tire damage. Solid Waste and Cardboard Compactors As discussed in Chapter 4, the transfer system in King County is undergoing major renovations to update station technology, improve efficiencies, and enhance environmental sustainability. The installation of solid waste compactors is one important component of that plan.The Bow Lake, Enumclaw, Shoreline, Factoria, and Vashon stations currently have waste compactors. All newly constructed recycling and transfer stations will incorporate compactors as well. Compacting solid waste at the stations reduces the number of trips necessary to transport the waste by up to 30 percent. Fewer trips translate directly into lower costs for fuel, equipment, and staff. For instance, in the first six months of operation at the Bow Lake Recycling and Transfer Station, the use of a compactor saved almost 900 trips and over 8,400 gallons of diesel fuel. ln addition to solid waste compactors, the division is installing cardboard compactors at many of the stations. These compactors will allow the division to reduce the number of trips needed to pick up the bales. Potential Changes in the Fee Structure The division may propose changes to the current fee structure in future rate studies. Possible changes include establishing different customer classes, discounts for low income customers, and moving some costs from the fee charged at transfer facilities and the landfill to a fee on the curbside collection bill. ln the 2Q14 Sustainable Solid Waste Management Study (KCSWD 2014), one of the recommendations was to look at revising the fee structure. The division completed a rate restructure study in 2017 and will be discussing with stakeholders what a rate restructure might entail (KCSWD 2017d). To equitably allocate the benefits and costs of transfer system improvements, the division may consider different customer classes. The customer classes would take into consideration the services provided, benefits received, use of the system, and the costs (incurred or avoided), of providing those services. An example of a customer class would be self-haul customers or commercial customers at the transfer stations. .zot9 Conprehensiue Solid Waste Managentent Platz 18893 Updated April '17.2019 ln 2010, legislation was passed authorizing the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission to approve discounts for low-income customers under certain circumstances. For the first time, the division is proposing a low- income discount in its 20i 9-2020 Rate Proposal (KCSWD 2018b). Before changes to the fee structure are proposed, the division is studying a number of factors, including the impact on revenue and cost, equity issues, and system-wide financing implications. These factors will be considered in future rate studies. Closure of the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill When Cedar Hills reaches capacity and closes, the division's solid waste tipping fee is expected to increase to cover the cost of using an alternate means of disposal. Whether it is export to an out-of-county landfill, disposal at a waste- to-energy facility, or other conversion technology, past studies, as well as a recent preliminary study, indicate that the cost for disposal after Cedar Hills closes will be higher (KCSWD 2017c) (see Chapter 6, Landfill Management and Solid Waste Disposal for further discussion). New Revenue Sources The division is continually exploring new sources of revenue to help offset reductions in tonnage. Cities may also want to consider additional funding sources to support their solid waste and waste prevention and recycling programs. Sales from the Landfill Gas-to- Energy Facility An example of the successful development of a revenue source is the sale of landfill gas. ln 2009, a landfill gas-to-energy facility began operations at Cedar Hills, and the division began to receive revenues from the sale of landfill gas. The facility, which is privately owned and operated by Bio Energy Washington , converts methane collected from the landfill into pipeline quality natural gas, which it sells to Puget Sound Energy. ln addition, the environmental attributes from the pipeline quality gas produced by the landfill gas-to-energy facility at Cedar Hills have value in the market and offer another ongoing source of revenue. The division, rather than the owner of the landfill gas facility, Bio Energy Washington , has contractually retained the environmental attributes associated with the project. ln January of 2011, the County Council unanimously approved an ordinance authorizing the division to enter into a contract to sell the environmental attributes associated with the landfill gas-to-energy project to Puget Sound Energy. This contract is structured so zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jul1 zotSThe Bio Energy Washingtorr plant at Cedar Hills landfill converts landfill qas to plpeline quality gas 7-10 Att A Page 190Ordinance 18893 Uodated Aoril 17,2019 that the county shares in profits that Puget 5ound Energy gets when selling the environmental attributes associated with the gas. The division receives revenue for both the gas and the environmental attributes associated with the gas. The revenue received by the division is highly volatile, and has ranged from $ 1 to $7 million per year, depending on production rates and the market price. Resource Recovery at Transfer Stations Significant amounts of recyclable materials - notably wood, metal and cardboard - are disposed at the transfer stations. The division is implementing new approaches, such as sorting the recyclable materials on the tipping floor and banning certain materials from disposal, to recover more of these materials at the transfer stations. Revenues from the sale of these materials help offset the costs of sorting and equipment. (see Chapter 5,SolidWasteTransfer and Processing System for further discussion). Fees from Materials Collected at the Transfer Stations King County Code (KCC 1 0.12.021.G) does not require that fees for recyclables recover the full costs of handling and processing recyclable materials. Therefore the fees can be set lower to encourage recycling over disposal. ln fact, for materials such as the standard curbside recyclables collected at the transfer stations, there is currently no fee at all, even though the division pays the cost of transport and processing. As collection services for more recyclable materials are added at transfer facilities and more tons of materials are recycled, fees will be evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to optimize the financial and environmental benefits. The division will continue to explore innovative opportunities, such as partnering with the private sector or other public agencies, to earn additional revenues and achieve savings through operational efficiencies. Although, these efforts may involve relatively small amounts of money, cumulatively they contribute to stabilizing rates for solid waste customers. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Ju/1 zot9 Att Material Recovery Facility (MRF) Assessment.

The Parlies intend to continue to cooperatively manage Solid Waste and to work collaboratively to maintain and periodically update the existing King County Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (Comprehensive Plan) adopted pursuant to chapter 70.95 RCW. C. The Parties continue to support the established goals of Waste Prevention and Recycling as incorporated in the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan, and to meet or surpass applicable environmental standards with regard to the Solid Waste System. D. The County and the Cities agree that System-related costs, including environmental liabilities, should be funded by System revenues which include but are not limited to insurance proceeds, grants and rates; E. The County, as the service provider, is in the best position to steward funds System revenues that the County and the Cities intend to be available to pay for environmental liabilities; and F. The County and the Cities recognize that at the time this Agreement goes into effect, it is impossible to know what the ultimate environmental liabilities could be; nevertheless, the County and the Cities wish to designate in this Agreement a protocol for the designation and distribution of funding for potential future environmental liabilities in order to protect the general funds of the County and the Cities. G. The County began renting the Cedar Hills Landfill from the State of Washington in 1960 and began using it for Disposal of Solid Waste in 1964.

The Parties expect that the Cedar Hills Landfill will be at capacity and closed at some date during the term of this Agreement, after which time all Solid Waste under this Agreement will need to be disposed of through alternate means, as detennined by the Cities and the County through amendments to the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan. The County currently estimates the useful life of the Cedar Hills Landfill will extend through 2025.It is possible that this useful life could be extended, or shortened, by System management decisions or factors beyond the control of the Parties. I. The County intends to charge rent for the use of the Cedar Hills Landfill for so long as the System uses this general fund asset and the Parties seek to clarifu terms relative to the calculation of the associated rent. J. The County and Cities participating in the System have worked collaboratively for several years to develop a plan for the replacement or upgrading of a series of transfer stations. The Parties acknowledge that these transfer station improvements, as they may be modified from time-to-time, will benefit Cities that are part of the System and the County. The Parties hbve determined that the extension of the term of the Original Agreement by twelve (12) years as accomplished by this Agreement is appropriate in order to facilitate the long-term financing of transfer station improvements and to mitigate rate impacts of such financing. K. The Parties have further determined that in order to equitably allocate the benefit to all System Users from the transfer station improvements, different customer classes may be established by the County to ensure System Users do not pay a disproportionate share of the cost of these improvements as a result of a decision by a city not to extend the term of the Original Agreement. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management P/an -Ju/1 zotS Att A Page 225c-3ordlnance 16893 Updated April 17, 2019 L.

Any insurance policy in effect on the termination date of this Agreement with a term that extends past the termination date shall be maintained until the end of the policy term. 8.6.c.ii Use Disposal Rates to establish and maintain a reserve fund to help pay the Parties' Environmental Liabilities not already covered by System rates or insurance maintained under Subsection 8.6.c.i above (\"Environmental Reserve Fund\"). The County shall establish the adequacy of the Environmental Reserve Fund in consultation with MSWAC and consistent with the financial policies described in Article VI. The County shall retain the Environmental Reserve Fund for a minimum of 30 years following the closure of the Cedar Hills Landfill (the \"Retention Period\"). During the Retention Period, the Environmental So/id tooYc Updated April 17,2019 shall be used solely for the puryoses for which it was established under this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, at the end of the Retention Period, the County and Cities shall agree as to the disbursement of any amounts remaining in the Environmental Reserue Fund. If unable to agree, the County and City agree to submit disbursement to mediation and if unsuccessful to binding arbitration in a manner similar to Section 39.34.180 RCW to the extent permitted by law 8.6.c,iii Pursue state or federal grant funds, such as grants from the Local Model Toxics Control Account under chapter 70.105D.070(3) RCW and chapter 173-322 WAC, or other state or federal funds as may be available and appropriate to pay for or remediate such Environmental Liabilities. 8.6.d If the funds available under Subsections 8.6.c.i-iii are not adequate to completely satisfl' the Environmental Liabilities of the Parties to this Agreement then to the extent feasible and permitted by law, the County will establish a financial plan including a rate schedule to help pay for the County and City's remaining Environmental Liabilities in consultation with MSWAC. 8.6.e The County and the City shall act reasonably and quickly to utilize funds collected or set aside through the means specified in Subsections 8.6.c.i-iii and 8.6.d to conduct or finance response or clean-up activities in order to limit the County and City's exposure, or in order to comply with a consent decree, administrative or other legal order. The County shall notify the City within 30 days of any use of the reserve fund established in 8.6.c.iii. 8.6.f In any federal or state regulatory proceeding, and in any action for contribution, money expended by the County from the funds established in Subsections 8.6.c.i-iii and 8.6.d. to pay the costs of remedial investigation, cleanup, response or other action required zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management P[an -Ju/1 Page 241ordrnance 16693 Updated April 17,2019 pursuant to a state or federal laws or regulations shall be considered by the Parties to have been expended on behalf and for the benefit of the County and the Cities. 8.6.g In the event that the funds established as specified in Subsections 8.6.c.i-iii and 8.6.d are insufficient to cover the entirety of the County and Cities' collective Environmental Liabilities, the funds described therein shall be equitably allocated between the County and Cities to satisfy their Environmental Liabilities. Factors to be considered in determining \"equitably allocated\" may include the size of each Party's System User base and the amount of rates paid by that System User base into the funds, and the amount of the Solid Waste generated by the Parties' respective System Users. Neither the County nor the Cities shall receive a benefit exceeding their Environmental Liabilities. 8.7 The County shall not charge or seek to recover from the City any costs or expenses for which the County indemnified the State of Washington in Exhibit A to the Quitclaim Deed from the State to the County for the Cedar Hills Landfill, dated February 24, 1993,to the extent such costs are not included in System costs.

After 2028 responsibilities assigned to the Forum shall be assigned to the Regional Policy Committee. The Parties agree that Solid Waste System policies and plans shall continue to be deemed regional countywide policies zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Jul1 Att A Page 244ordlnanee 16693 Updated April 17,2019 and plans that shall be referred to the Regional Policy Comrnittee for review consistent with King County Charter Section 270.30 and chapter I.24KingCounty Code. XI. COMPREHENSIVE SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN 11.1 King County is designated to prepare the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan (Comprehensive Plan) and this plan shall include the City's Solid Waste Management Comprehensive Plan pursuant to chapter 70.95.080(3) RCW. ll.2 The Comprehensive Plan shall be reviewed and any necessary revisions proposed. The County shall consult with MSWAC to determine when revisions are necessary. King County shall provide services and build facilities in accordance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan. 11.3 The Comprehensive Plans will promote Waste Prevention and Recycling in accordance with Washington State Solid Waste management priorities pursuant to chapter 70.95 RCW, at a minimum. II.4 The Comprehensive Plans will be prepared in accordance with chapter 70.95 RCW and Solid Waste planning guidelines developed by the Department of Ecology. The plan shall include, but not be limited to: Il.4.a Descriptions of and policies regarding management practices and facilities required for handling all waste Epes; I 1.4.b Schedules and responsibilities for implementing policies; ll.4.c Policies concerning waste reduction, Recycling, Energy and Resource Recovery, collection, transfer, long-haul transport, Disposal, enforcement and administration; and zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Waste Management Plan -Ju$ zotS A Page 245c-23urdtnance 18E93 Updated April 17,2019 1 1.4.d Operational plan for the elements discussed in Item c above. I 1.5 The cost of preparation by King County of the Comprehensive Plan will be considered a cost ofthe System and financed out ofthe rate base. 11.6 The Comprehensive Plans will be \"adopted\" within the meaning of this Agreement when the following has occurred: ll.6.a The Comprehensive Plan is approved by the King County Council; and 1 1.6.b The Comprehensive Plan is approved by cities representing three-quarters of the population of the incorporated population ofjurisdictions that are parties to the Forum Interlocal Agreement. In calculating the three-quarters, the calculations shall consider only those incorporated jurisdictions taking formal action to approve or disapprove the Comprehensive Plan within 120 days of receipt of the Plan. The 120-day time period shall begin to run from receipt by an incorporated jurisdiction of the Forum's recommendation on the Comprehensive Plan, or, if the Forum is unable to make a recommendation, upon receipt of the Comprehensive Plan from the Forum without recommendation. Ll.7 Should the Comprehensive Plan be approved by the King County Council, but not receive approval of three-quarters of the cities acting on the Comprehensive Plan, and should King County and the cities be unable to resolve their disagreement, then the Comprehensive Plan shall be referred to the State Department of Ecology and the State Department of Ecology will resolve any disputes regarding Comprehensive Plan adoption and adequacy by approving or disapproving the Comprehensive Plan or any part thereof. 1 1.8 King County shall determine which cities are affected by any proposed amendment to the Comprehensive Plan. If any City disagrees with such determination, then the City can request that the Forum determine whether or not the City is affected. Such zotg Comprehensiue Solid Wste Management Plan -Juj 246orc,rnance 16893 Updated April 17,2019 detennination shall be made by a two-thirds majority vote of all representative members of the Forum. ll.9 Should King County and the affected jurisdictions be unable to agree on ' amendments to the Comprehensive Plan, then the proposed amendments shall be referred to the Department of Ecology to resolve any disputes regarding such amendments. 11.10 Should there be any impasse between the Parties regarding Comprehensive Plan adoption, adequacy, or consistency or inconsistency or whether any permits or programs adopted or proposed are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, then the Department of Ecology shall resolve said disputes. XII. MITIGATION l2.l The County will design, construct and operate Solid Waste facilities in a manner to mitigate their impact on host Cities and neighboring communities pursuant to applicable law and regulations. 12.2 The Parties recognize that Solid Waste facilities are regional facilities. The County fuither recognizes that host Cities and neighboring communities may sustain impacts which can include but are not limited to local infrastructure, odor, traffic into and out of Solid Waste facilities, noise and litter. 12.3 Collaboration in Environmental Review. In the event the County is the sole or co- Lead Agency, then prior to making a threshold determination under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), the County will provide a copy of the SEPA environmental checklist, if any, and proposed SEPA threshold determination to any identifiable Host City (as defined below) and adjacent or neighboring city that is signatory to the Agreement and that may be affected by the zotg Cotnprehensiue So/id Waste Management P/an -Jufu 66vJ Updated April 17,2019 project (\"Neighboring City\") and seek their input. For any facility for which the County prepares an Envirorunental Impact Statement (EIS), the County will meet with any identified potential Host City (as defined below) and any Neighboring City to seek input on the scope of the EIS and appropriate methodologies and assumptions in preparing the analyses supporting the EIS. However, nothing in this Section shall limit or impair the County's ability to timely cornplete the environmental review process. 12.4 Collaboration in Proiect Permitting. If a new or reconstructed Solid Waste facility is proposed to be built within the boundaries of the City (\"Host City\") and the project requires one or more \"project permits\" as dehned in chapter 36.708.020(4) RCW from the Host City, before submitting its first application for any of the project permits, the County will meet with the Host City and any Neighboring City, to seek input. However, nothing in this Section shall limit or impair the County's ability to timely submit applications for or receive permits, nor waive any permit processing or appeal timelines. 12.5 Separately, the County and the City recognize that in accordance with 36.58.080 RCW, a city is authorized to charge the County to mitigate impacts directly attributable to a County-owned Solid Waste facility. The County acknowledges that such direct costs include wear and tear on infrastructure including roads. To the extent that the City establishes that such charges are reasonably necessary to mitigate such impacts, payments to cover such impacts may only be expended only to mitigate such impacts and are System costs. If the City believes that it is entitled to mitigation under this Agreement, the City may request that the County undertake a technical analysis regarding the extent of impacts authorized for mitigation. Upon receiving_such a request, the County, in coordination with the City and any necessary technical consultants, will develop any analysis that is reasonable and appropriate to identify impacts. The cost for such zotg Comprehensiue Solid Waste Mazzagetnent P[an - July A Page 248urornance 1u693 Updated April 17,2019 analysis is a System cost. The City and County will work cooperatively to detennine the appropriate mitigation payments and will document any agreement in a Memorandum of Agreement. If the City and the County cannot agree on mitigation payments, the dispute resolution process under chapter 36.58.080 RCW will apply rather than the dispute resolution process under Section XII of the Agreement. XIII. DISPUTE RESOLUTION 13.1 Unless otherwise expressly stated, the terms of this Section XIII shall apply to disputes arising under this Agreement. t. 13.2 Initial Meeting. 73.2.a Either Party shall give notice to the other in writing of a dispute involving this Agreement. 13.2.b Within ten (10) business days of receiving or issuing such notice, the County shall send an email notice to all Cities. 13.2.c Within ten (10) business days of receiving the County's notice under Subsection 13.2.b, aCity shall notiff the County in writing or email if it wishes to participate in the Dispute Resolution process. 13.2.d Within not less than twenty-one (21) days nor more than thirly (30) days of the date of the initial notice of dispute issued under Subsection 13.2.a, the County shall schedule a time for staff from the County and any City requesting to parlicipate in the dispute resolution process (\"Participating City\") to meet (the \"initial meeting\").

While Normandeau's WARM inputs are not available, results ranged from 12,000 to 80,000 MTCO2e per year. Their range is likely explained by a different waste composition assumption, exclusion of bypass waste disposal, and much longer time periods (and thus larger plants burning more materials) than in this division comparison, which used 2029 as the base year. The model inputs in the Mass Burn column are the division's assumptions of Normandeau's model inputs. 2 Paper 1.6.7%,PlasticL2.2%,Food 20.5%, 16,8%,Olher Organics 15.3%, Metal 4.7%,Glass2.6%,ElectronicsO.4%, Household Hazardous Waste 0.9%. 3 2015 Waste Categorization material categories that create WARM offsets when landfilled include corrugated containers 3%, Dimensional Lumber II%,Yard Trimmings 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Appendix E Responsiveness Summary Att A Page 258* llo@oNo6Response (Page numbers refer to the 2019 Plan) EPA has a manual that thoroughly describes the WARM model and its inputs.

Thank you for your comment. Your suggestion has been added. Chapter 4, Action 24-s and page 4-24 addresses service levels county-wide and on Vashon lsland. A discussion of existing composting facilities and developing technologies is found on pages 5-26-28. Compost facilities have been added to Figure 2-4. Table 5-5 is also added, including how much material is handled at compost facilities. ln addition, tonnage handled at the private MRFs (Table 2-1) and construction and demolition facilities (Tables 4-7 and 4-8) has been added. The compost facilities in King County have been added to Figure2-4.Comment Table lshould have a clearer description of the inputs, and the notes could be more descriptive in declaring why the inputvariables were used for the 3 disposal methods. For example, for \"Moisture\" it seems evident why \"wet\" is selected for Cedar Hills, but not as clear that \"national average\" is used for Mass Burn,when the WTE plant would presumably be located in King County. The final plan adoption criteria noted in the first bullet on P. 1-3 requires cities representing% of the total population within the plan to act within 120 days. There are a number of smaller cities represented in this Plan that are marginalized using this sole measure. Please consider adding a second criteria like % of the population and% of the number of cities...not iust population. this category should also include optimizing/reducing product packaging, including shipping containers. All King county residents and businesses should have access to organics collection service or local compost facilities. ln addition, more information should be provided about existing compost facilities and new development a lternatives- \"System Graphic\" needs some quantification and additional information, such as a figure caption explaining and quantifying material flows, numbers of private compost facilities, transfer stations, recycling facilities, etc. so the reader better understands the relative magnitudes of the various segments and components.

More information on this topic has been added to the discussion in Chapter 4 regarding a sustainable materials management approach. An addition has been made to Figure2-2 to indicate decentralized solutions. Thank you for your suggested edits. Changes have been made to these sections.A system should be piloted whereby we harvest landfill gasses, other gas-producing businesses, and future compost facilities and anaerobic digesters throughout the county and process them to RNG rather than flare off or carbon-cleanse them. lnstalling new distributed compost facilities on Vashon lsland and elsewhere would greatly reduce vehicle emissions, energy use, and ferry costs required for garbage and yard waste transportation to eastern King County. Decentralized AD and other renewables should be included in \"Mitigation\" strategies. There is no mention of resiliency or circular economics of materials. These are components of sustainability too and should be incorporated and prioritized. Should include decentralized solutions. A smaller orange loop should be added. The heading Expanding the Collection of Recvclable and Compostable Materials should say Expanding the Collection of Recyclable and Degrodoble Organic Moterials. ln this section we recommend you add a paragraph that says: There is a convergence of issues around source separated organic waste in King County. These include urban farming, food waste diversion through a variety of technologies, avoidance of synthetic chemicals in horticulture and agriculture, food banks, jobs and resiliency issues around food, smart grids, carbon footprint, climate change, alternative fuel vehicles, and distributed renewable energy. This convergence will continue for the foreseeable future and King County will have to be flexible and innovative to remain in a leadership role since organic waste is such a significant organic fraction in both the waste and recvcling streams.

Usage data for solid waste is not as readily available as it is for energy, so would be difficult to implement Although the recycling volumes are low and disposed tons are higher in comparison, the overall tons generated by these two generator types is much smaller when compared to single-family and commercial generators. SWD does have education and outreach for multi-family and some cities choose to provide greater emphasis on multi-family collection. Since the beginning of 2O18, SWD has placed a ban on certain recyclable materials being disposed at the transfer stations where recycling opportunities exist. This ban has been accompanieddemand for the recycling of these materials. lf a recycling market does not have complete capacity for receipt of asphalt shingles, then demand for that market is lacking. What is King County doing to help develop a market, such as including recycled asphalt shingles in the county's road paving projects? A 3 year lag for data availability seems excessive in this digital age and should be decreased, efforts should be made to acquire timely and comprehensive data relevant to waste & recycling. The bar-graph should include current (2015) values for each area as a baseline. The bar grab should include several additional time points to illustrate trends (eg, perhaps also 2010, 2006,2OO2). As demonstrated by electricity providers, when consumers have access to their usage data, they are able to reduce usage and optimize peak loads. lf consumers were aware of the waste quantities at various local and regional scales, they could potentially modify their behaviors. We need more geo-referenced temporal data. The disposed volumes are very high yet recycled volumes are disproportionately low for these 2 groups compared with businesses & single family residential, so focused efforts should be made to increase recycling rates among these 2 groups!

It is not clear in the Comprehensive Plan whether any of the projections that are included were prepared using the second step. lt would be helpful if each projection clearly stated which technique was used in its preparation. Given (1) the recycling rate has been difficult to forecast and (2) the sensitivity of tonnage forecasts and related life of the Cedar Hills Landfill, it is very important that readers understand the recycling rate assumptions used in each projection.

However, we believe that the region cannot collectively achieve any of these goals without an unwavering commitment on the part of all cities to implement most if not all of the recommended tools such as mandatory garbage collection and recycling. lf all cities do not implement all the actions, only incremental improvements will occur. lt is important that the Plan also explicitly express the gravity of indecision and inaction. We recognize that implementing the variety of actions in the Plan can be expensive and we encourage the County to continue to provide and even increase grant funding and technical assistance to all city members of the system to help us achieve our waste prevention and recycling goals. The City of Maple Valley recommends that King County conti nue to allow cities to use King County grant funds for recycling collection events and not phase out collection events as an option. The public relies on these events to recycle materials not collected curbside or at transfer stations. Phasing out the recycling events would be perceived by the public as a reduction in City services, and could lead to increased illegal dumpine. We encourage the development of a new grant program to support cities and other stakeholder help meet waste reduction and recycle goals identified in the plan. Redmond supports the goal to divert 70% of garbage through recycling. As the region implements the Growth Management Act (GMA), we are seeing a significant increase in multifamily construction.

There will be ample opportunity to discuss these issues both with our advisory committees and other venues-More education/support should be provided toward educating constituents on what/how to sort for comingle Shoppers could be educated to look for recyclable containers and bags at their grocery store. Consider banning plastic bags in King County. Need more commitment to education and research and development. Solutions are out there.

Need novel education paths, including promotion of short educational films about how things are sorted at our sorting stations, how/what to compost, and a general knowledge of plastics and the waste stream. WMW supports the exploration of a product stewardship strategy and concepts forthe management oftoxic materials or materials that can be difficult to manage. However, we do not advocate product stewardship or extended producer responsibility (EPR) for traditional recyclables such as paper and packaging forthe following reasons that we hope that King County will adequately consider. EPR for paper and packaging focuses solely on the end-of- life management of materials, rather than considering the full lifecycle impacts of materials, along their entire life. Producer focus will be on end-of-life recycling of their products, instead of reducing energy and greenhouse gas outputs and impacts along the lifecycle of the producl especially in upstream design and production of the materials. Thus, EPR for paper and packaging will make it impossible to change the focus on achieving broader environmental goals such as reducing carbon footprints.Chapter 4 Chapter 4 - Action 4-SZero Waste Vashon Waste ManagementmI N Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period \\)o \\o no evidence that EPR increases recycling. Successful, sustainable recycling programs are the result of comprehensive and sweeping local solid waste policies and programs, such as those offered by King County in this Plan that achieve high diversion rates. These developed and thoughtful solid waste policies help drive consumer behavioral changes by crafting successful recycling programs that focus on social behavior changes and creating the right local incentives. That is, solid waste policies are needed to drive recycling programs, not money from producers and manufacturers- Our current system is built around local communities and accountability. Local officials hear from their neighbors and constituents when something is not working. That relationship link between local government and communities will be broken with an EPR system for paper and packaging. Producers will control the programs, creati ng uniform statewide service offeri ngs. There will be no role for local ordinances. Many local communities have created rates, bans and incentives to drive successful recycling programs. These ordinances can reflect shared local values, environmental ethos, and respect differences in geography, population density, ecosystem vulnerability and economics. With manufacturers running a uniform statewide program, local governments have few incentives to innovate with education programs, variable fees, or innovative service options. Finally, EPR for packaging and paper is focused on driving to the lowest cost as the primary goal.

EPR fees are also regressive with the increased costs and fees associated with EPR born disproportionately by low- income households who spend a higher portion of their income on packaging than on durable goods. Regional capacity for recycling of materials is not developed via education and enforcement ofdisposal bans, but, rather creating and offering incentives will build capacity. WMW encourages King County to generate incentives to promote investment in construction and demolition debris facilities and diversion of these materials from the waste stream. As a result, self-regulating industry enforcement would also evolve in developing and shaping the market demand for these materials. WMW recommends adding an additional action item to monitor recycling markets, at the very least on an annual basis, especially with market disruption factors in play such as China's National Sword policy. We certainly support establishing a formal process, and related criteria, to remove materials from the designated recyclables list as market conditions may require. Currently, there is an informal process to eliminate items from the list, which generally involves asking processors if the facility currently accepts a material stream.

Cedar Grove suggests the County strongly consider no longer providing exemptions to the requirement of weekly curbside collection of organics. These exemptions, allowing bi-weekly residential collection, do not support County stated goals for managing garbage and recycling for the next 20 years. A firm commitment to weekly collection of organics will increase diversion from the landfill and help the County reach its 70 percent goal. This is a simple but effective way to increase participation in recycling County- wide. County studies show that one of the primary barriers to public participation in organics programs is the fear, real or perceived, of recycling food scraps. And the allowance of bi- weekly collection of organics serves as a deterrent toof biochar, a product of pyrolysis of dried organic material, a great soil amendment that additionally sequesters carbon for more than millennial timescales.

Additionally, weekly collection will ensure that transfer and processing facilities receive fresh and less odiferous material that otherwise could have spent many weeks decomposing in bins. The weekly flow of material, therefore, will mitigate community impacts. County resident perceptions and behaviors have evolved significantly over the past 10 years towards a commitment to keeping valuable natural resources out of the landfill and into productive use. Weekly collection is a proven wayto influence those who are not participating in organics recycling to do so. lt will also likely increase the participation of those already committed to the program through increased opportunities. Moreover, for the ratepayer, standardizing collection frequency would bring service equity across the cities within the County, and increased diversion will provide desired flexibility regarding decisions for disposal of garbage over the long term.

The 7O% goal remains in the Plan because the majority of the advisory committee members wished to keep it.Although King County addresses sustainable materials management later in this same chapter, the County could be a leader in this arena by fully embracing sustainable materials management (5MM) principles and begin a departure from solely evaluating rerycling goals based on weight, such as the County's interim Boal of achievingT0% recycling. SMM represents a paradigm shift in how we look at and manage materials by reducing environmental impacts throughout all stages of a product's life cycle, as these materials move through the economy, from resource extraction to end of life management. SMM's emphasis is on protecting human health and the environment by advancing the sustainable use of materials throughout their lifecycle to minimize waste and environmental impacts, including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and in water and energy use. Solid waste policies should encourage true recycling and not \"diversion for diversion's sake.\" The best way to embrace SMM is to adopt Life Cycle thinking and analysis, in which each material is evaluated at a broader level to determine its optimal disposition. lnstead of measuring success based on a percentage recycled, success should be awarded for greenhouse gas emissions reduced, for example. ln using traditional weight-based recovery or rerycling rates, recovery of materials is treated the same: A ton is a ton is a ton and all recovery is treated the same (recycling = composting = \"countind' energy recovery).

However, SMM compares the environmental outcomes of waste management, focuses on the full life cycle, not only end-of-life management, and ultimately supports more and better recycling and waste prevention. People start to change behavior when it costs money. lt is time that we ask fees for all the garbage that is produced via throw away containers, charge for coffee cups to go, charge more for people who don't recvcle properlv etc. I'd love for recycling to be weekly, rather than bi-weekly. We wind up with an overfull can and have left over that we have to hold for the next 2 weeks. King County has a goal to recycle 7O percent of our waste stream, an increase from 52%Ioday. What sorts of ideas do you have to help us reach this ambitious goal? The goal to recycle 70 percent of the waste stream is built using flawed data*. Consider a goal that asks cities to reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill (isn't that the desired outcome?) For example, if the average pounds per household is 26 pounds in Kent or 23 pounds in Bellevue, cities could be asked to campaign their citizens to reduce one pound per household per week. *King County uses tonnage data (total amount at the curb minus the weight of recycling and organics). This premise is flawed becbuse 1. Recycling is becoming lighter and lighter (it used to take 40,000 empty water bottles to make a ton; today it takes 90,000). 2. There are third-party recyclers who do not report their data to the county or state 3. There are third-party landscapers (for homes and commercial properties) who do not report their tonnage data to the county or state.Chapter 4 - Product Stewardship Chapter 4 - Recycling Chapter 4 - RecyclingAnn Siems Debbie Shapiro Republic Services cEooo :, -{ No Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period o-s f o)foo @@@(t c oooe o =. -{ No @Thank you for your comment Thank you for your comment.

As King County moves forward with these services, it is essential for the future of King County to continue its commitment to recycling. To reach our goal to recycle 70 percent of our waste stream, we must continue to educate the public on the benefits and best methods for recycling. When in doubt, residents will most likely deposit the item into the waste stream. This education effort must be combined with a commitment from local government to make certain recyclables are recycled.

I live in Snohomish County but work in Woodinville, in King County. I was reading the Woodinville Weekly the other day and there was an article titled \"Council gets the lowdown on waste\". ln it you had explained that\"TO/o of what goes to the landfill doesn't belong there\" and that \"sorting doesn't always work\". Then you say initiatives will be more achievable by encouraging manufacturers to use more sustainable materials. The article goes on to say that the three major options that are being contempl;ted are building a new facility, developing the existing facility at Cedar Hills, or exporting the waste by rail to an out-of-county landfill. What I'm writing you to say is that while I think using sustainable materials is a step in the right direction, I think there should be a bigger push to consume less altogether. We as a society have become complacent when it comes to how much we consume. lt has become too easy to buy something that will become useless within a few months, then throw it away. There isn't any accountability when we are able to throw something away and maintain an \"out of sight, out of mind\" mentality. ln the article I think you had mentioned that more education on what can be recycled or composted is in order, which I agree with.

The need for a new waste facility or developing the existing facility or shipping the waste to a different facility are all inevitable, but perhaps we can delay the need for them by shifting away from a consumerist society.

With these closures, Factoria becomes the practical and designated station for Newcastle; however, the Plan does not recognize Newcastle as being part of the Northeast Service Area. Newcastle should be formally added to the Northeast Service Area and be planned for accordingly. The new Factoria Transfer station has better facilities than Renton Transfer Station, which will attract more traffic to the al ready overburdened Factoria/Coal Creek/l-405 interchange area. ln addition, when the Renton Station closes all of Newcastle's haulers, along with other areas of north Renton and the southeast, will be redirected to the . Factoria Transfer Station. This is particularly concerning to Newcastle because as bad as it is on l-405, most haulers in our area will choose Coal Creek Parkway as the alternative route to and from Factoria. While Newcastle has designated Coal Creek Parkway a principle arterial intended to connect larger communities, it was not anticipated the road would be used for heavy commercial vehicles. We are therefore concerned over the impact that increased use of Coal Creek Parkway by commercial haulers will have on its pavement life.

The division will adapt involvement approaches used for previous transfer station projects to the needs of the northwest service area.Turning next to the Comp Plan's recommended actions on the transfer of solid waste, Woodinville is particularly interested in action 1-t as it applies to planning for adequate transfer capacity in the Northeast service area. Woodinville understands that demand management strategies cannot substitute for a transfer station in the Northeast service area because certain circumstances, such as Bellevue's participation in the system, have changed since that option was first evaluated. With respect to the remaining three options for providing transfer capacity, Woodinville requests to be involved in the decision-making process. As Woodinville understands them, the three options include: (1) continuing operations at the Houghton Transfer Station (which corresponds with \"Alternative 1\" Solid Waste Transfer and Processing System Facility lmprovements in the EIS at 1-5); (2) building a new transfer station in the Northeast service area; and (3) building several smaller transfer sites in the Northeast service area (these last two options appear to be different variations of '?lternative 3\" in the EIS at1--71. The Comp Plan states that \"an advisory committee composed of Northeast service area residents, city, and business representatives would be formed to develop siting criteria that would guide the site selection process,\" a practice that the Comp Plan indicates is consistent with King County's Solid Waste Facility Siting Plan (hereinafter the Siting Plan\") (Comp Plan at 5-19). The Siting Plan states that \"[c]itizen advisory committees shall be used to reflect the values of host communities as an effective means of weighting criteria\" (Siting Plan at C-17). Based on the Comp Plan, the Northeast service areaconcerned that siting additional waste handling facilities like those being discussed may have significant impacts on City residents and threaten the City's ability to adequately maintain this balance- Chapter Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8,?OLB public comment period s t9o OoTable 5-4 was removed from the Plan. Thank you for your comment. According to the Comp Plan, transfer capacity in the Northeast area will be \"allocated equitably among jurisdictions\" (Comp Plan at 5-21). Those transfer station site options that are geographically distant from existing waste handling and disposal facilities should be preferred over those site options that are in close proximity to existing facilities (see Siting Plan at C-1-5, C-15). And, relatedly, Woodinville's support of the Cascade Recycling Center, the Brightwater WastewaterTreatment Plant, and the DTG Recycling Group should be taken into consideration. lf the Countv intends to build a new Northeast transfer station, theincludes the cities of Woodinville, Kenmore, Kirkland, and Redmond, and parts of Bellevue, Bothell, and unincorporated King County (Comp Plan at 5- 19). One pointon which Woodinville seeks clarification is whether the list of Northeast service area municipalities in the Comp Plan is exhaustive and whether all of those entities will be represented in the decision-making process via the advisory committee or some other vehicle. As noted earlier, Woodinville requests to be a part of the siting process and is committed to remaining engaged throughout the decision- making process. Another point on which Woodinville would appreciate clarification is the data underlying Table 5-4 (Comp Plan at 5-20). Although the percentage of a jurisdiction's transactions through Houghton Transfer Station is relevant to understanding use of that station, Woodinville would like to obtain the data on the actual tonnage and number of truck trips generated by each jurisdiction's use of Houghton. Moreover, Table 5-4 does not list all of the jurisdictions provided for in the Comp Plan as comprising the Northeast service area; transactions from Kenmore, Bellevue, and unincorporated King County are not listed (Comp Plan at 5- 20).Chapter 5 Chapter 5 WoodinvilleWoodinville lil Iwt,og f 0)foo @@(o C^) C { Na (omIw5 Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March A, 2O!8 public comment period t!o \\o Oo1l A'@o N@NThank you for your comment.

The current EIS draft associated with the Comp Plan does not yet address the specific impacts of Northeast sites because no sites have yet been identified. Woodinville seeks to be an active participant in the site identification and screening process if the County goes forward with either of the two alternatives involving the construction of new facilities in the Northeast. Based upon the analysis completed in the ElS, the best alternative may be to continue use ofthe Houghton transfer station, and along those lines, ensure full utilization of all existing and possibly underutilized transfer stations to avoid the need to construct new facilities. Creating a new Northeast transfer station would result in a loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat, would produce CO2 emissions from construction and opdration, would impact noise and transportation during construction, and involve high capital costs (ElS at 1-7 to 1-10). Additionally, maintaining Houghton is the lowest cost option in terms of capital and operating costs (Comp Plan 5-22). Regardless of which alternative the county pursues, Woodinville seek to provide ongoing input because appropriate mitigation of impacts on cities is imDortant to regional equitv.

With increased demand on Cedar Hills and plans to look for areas of potential expansion, please ensure that this is addressed so other communities don't have to experience the same issues. Of course the waste needs to go somewhere and there is no perfect solution but please enforce facilities to manage odors effectively. Success here starts by offering more services at our transfer stations. AD technology is standard in Europe and Asia to properly process food waste.

The Plan and EIS text have been revised to include a discussion of existing odor impacts in communities containing commercial-scale composting operations.Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the King County Draft Solid Waste Management Plan {Draft SWMP) and related Draft Environmental lmpact Statement (DEIS). We are focusing our comments on the air quality impacts of the current and proposed alternatives for operations by King County Solid Waste Division (KCSWD) and its contractors. Specifically,we are interested that the air impacts related to organics processing and recycling (also referred to as \"composting\" in this letter) be adequately identified and considered. The Draft SWMP and DEIS discuss the current level of organics recycling, estimated at 52% in 2Qt4 and identify various alternatives that would increase that to a goal of 7O%. The air quality analysis in the DEIS discusses a variety of general air quality issues on this topic, but does not clearly acknowledge (or discuss) the existins odor impact conditions in communities with composting operations. The summary for Alternative I (No Action) states the impact of this choice would be increased greenhouse gas emissions and higher disposal costs, both as a result of not increasing the rerycling rate. lt also states that the existing organics recycling capacity is unknown, butthat increasing to a rate of 7O% will require more facilities and/or capacity. As the primary recipient of odor complaints for King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish Counties, our agency has a comprehensive understanding of the impacts current composting operations have on surrounding communities, and they are significant. ln2OL7, theAgency received approximately 4,010 complaints relatedto odor. Of those, approximately 2,500 were directly related to the composting facility in Maple Valley.

Based on the feedback we receive from the public, we believe that these existing conditions have not been adequately identified or evaluated inthe DEIS and will be an impediment to additional recycling because communities will not have the confidence that impacts will be properly mitigated. On page 5-30 of the Draft SWMP, the County speaks to these issues indirectly. Specifically, it states: o More capacity will be needed to recycle more as the existing facilities may be near their maximum permitted capacities (p. 5-30, fl2). Regional composting facilities were designed for yard waste, not the mix of food, yard and compostable packaging that is collected and processed today. There exists a need for upgraded technology to manage the new material mix (p. 5-30, tl2, 2nd bullet) r Financing for technology upgrades at existing facilities (p. 5-30, Jl4,4th bullet) Some of these observations were identified as needed to maintain the quality of the finished product. We do not have specific information to comment on the existing capacity inthe marketfor organics rerycling, but it is likely that the existing facilities are at or beyond their capacity, especially when you consider the short-term processing rates they can manage. The throughput at these facilities varies seasonally for reasons beyond their control. The comment above regarding the original design for yard waste is apt. Recent research has indicated that increasinB the food waste portion lo t5% of the total waste stream (food and yardwaste combi ned) can double the organic emission rate from composting operations, meaning that more food recycled leads to more organic emissions which contributesChapter 5 - Composting/ Air qualityPuget Sound Clean Air AgencyResponsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period,i @ The Plan.and EIS text have been revised to include expanded discussions of odor impacts associated with existing commercial-scale composting facilities, potential odor impacts resulting from increased organics recycling and composting, and measures to mitigate potential odor impacts.to an increase in odorous emissions. These increased odor impacts also have not been adequately identified or evaluated. Consequently, we request that the DEIS be revised as follows: 1. Revise the Summary (Chapter 1.lfiables S) and Chapters 3-5 to include: a description and discussion of existing conditions (in 2017-2018) in communities surroundingcomposting facilities in the County {and facilities used by the County for organics recycling), and identification of odor impacts caused by existing conditions so that all alternatiVes and impacts can be evaluated adequately against existing conditions. 2. Revise all subsequent discussions of alternatives and impacts in the Summary (Chapter 1./Tables S) and Chapters 3-5 to account for, as needed, the updated description and discussion of existing conditions per item {1) above. 3. Revise Chapters 3-5 to identify and evaluate odor impacts from the proposed increased rates and types of recycling for each alternative (and revise the conclusions reached related to such impacts in 3.2.2.3, 4.2.2.3, 4.4.2.3 and 5.2.2.3 as needed). 4. Revise Chapters 3-5 to include and evaluate specific, reasonable mitigation measures for the odor impacts to be caused by each alternative and describe the mitigation measures that the County is willing to commit to implement to address the odor impactsthat will be experienced in the communities for each alternative.

Thank you for your comment and support of a regional discussion. Thank you for your comment. The information provided is not intended to be exhaustive, butln addition, it is important to note in the Draft SWMP and DEIS that capacity factors alone will not address the existing environment for odor impacts. The Draft SWMP and DEIS do not identify what future mitigation may be appropriate for future composting facilities or expanded capacities at existing composting facilities. While some specific mitigation will also be considered in future review of specific proposals, as requested above in ( ). the County should now identify in the Draft SWMP and DEIS reasonable mitigation measures for odor impacts and what mitigation the County is willing to commit to implement to address the odor impacts that will be experienced in the communities for each alternative it is considering.

First and foremosf the City of Woodinville is proud to be regional partners with the other cities and entities within and outside of King County. Despite its relatively small size, Woodinville is home to, or in close proximity to several critical facilities, including the Waste Management Cascade Recycling Center; the Brightwater Wastewater Treatment Plant; DTG Recycling Group; regional trails such as the Burke-Gilman, Sammamish River, and Eastside Rail Corridor; State Route 2O2; and Northshore Athletic Fields. While Woodinville is honored to play a crucial role in the region, the City has devoted considerable resources to addressing and funding resolution to and mitigation of these facilities. Firsf the Cascade Rerycling Center in Woodinville is the only recycling facility located within the Northeast service area (see Comp Plan at 2-9, 5-17). lt is the second busiest waste handling facility in Northeast King County, and processes a comparable tonnage of materials to KCSWD's busiest ' transfer stations, with the exception of Bow Lake (See chart below).1 As the home of the Cascade Rerycling Center, whose service area is vast, Woodinville experiences increased truck traffic, litter and debris, and it requires additional law enforceme nt activity (Attachment A). Secondly, Woodinville faces the threat of negative impacts from various seismic scenarios related to faults at or near the Brightwater Wastewater Treatment Plant. For example, as noted in the Draft Supplemental EIS on Brightwater, if an earthquake affects Brightwate/s water flow storage, overflows can be anticipated at the Woodinville Pump Station (see Draft Supplemental EIS on Brightwater, FigureChapter - Woodinville's E =. -{ No @sol Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period Thank you for your comment.

Given Woodinville's existing contributions to waste handling in this region, the City is aware of the importance of mitigating the impacts of waste handling and disposal facilities on the surrounding communities (Attachment B). lThe Comp Plan refers to the Cascade Recycling Center as a materials recovery facility, which is distinct from a solid waste facility. Nevertheless, it is worth comparing the tonnage of materials being processed in regional facilities in the solid waste system, regardless of whether those materials are recyclables or garbage, because both types of facilities have similar impacts on their host cities. The following Factsheet on the Cascade Recycling Center states that an average of 35 tons of recycling come through hourly: http ://wmnorthwest.co m/cascaderecvclins/siflfactsheet. odf . Woodinville's conclusion that the Cascade Recycling Center processes more tonnage of materials than almost every transfer station in King County is supported by comparing this Factsheet with the information contained in Table 5-1 of the Comp Plan Consider the RNG potential of organics for fuel security for the SWD to act \"in island mode.\" The NE Service Area Transfer Station (NETS) siting process is a significant upcoming process, but if this process begins in a timely manner, some details in this section of the draft Plan may be obsolete before this Plan is adopted.

Since County transfer station labor agreements mandate shift and staffing levels, it is not apparent that operating costs \"would be lower\" forthe \"existing Houghton Station\" plus a \"hauler-only station\" than the cost of operating a modern, combined station. For example, while \"self-hauler\" station may receive lesstonnage, itwill have several times more transactions than a hauler-only station. Labor agreements imply that KCSWD would find it challenging to operate and maintain Houghton transfer station \"weekends only\" just for self-haulers.

Due to the higher cost of having two separate stations operating as a \"pair\" or \"combination\", but lacking all services expected at modern transfer stations, avoid assuming ratepayers will support the \"dual\" or \"paired\" station approach. ln addition, KCSWD operations and outreach will be complicated by having to train self-haul customers about the difference between these two transfer stations from the other five \"urban\" stations, including why sets of customers are denied access to a potentially more convenient transfer station-Chapter 5, pg 5-23 Chapter 5, pg5-24 Chapter 5, pg5-27 Chapter 5, pe5-27Federal Way Federal Way Federal Way Federal Way l,o@o oo-.1 m Is rO'ltaUro Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period t!o \\o $ b\\ s.e N. o'5. 5\\ Ss s\\ a N :: :, o Oo1lo(oooo@Thank you for your suggested edits.

The Plan should outline regional organics processing capacity issues/limits and what actions the system can contemplate taking in order to develop additional capacity in conjunction with diversion of more compostables from MSW. Define how processing capacity may need to be expanded in order to meet the anticipated diversion of compostables. The Plan should provide additional information about planning ways to expand organics processing capacity. Examples could include the system exploring the potential for creating its own capacity, or contracting for the development of additional capacity, perhaps at closed areas of Cedar Hills landfill or other KCSWD sites. The Plan should suggest a timeline for discussion/planning, and potential project implementation.

This may have changed the numbering (and/or the \"facility hours\" criteria may be added to the list below the chart). Chapter 6 discusses the long- term disposal options associated with the Plan. We would encourage the County to further develop Cedar Hills with the goal of providing disposal to at least 2040. Although we recognize the challEnges of each of the options, we feel this is the most cost-effective option at this time and we should maximize the use of the existing facility prior to pursuing other options which will need to be considered in the future. As recently as the mid 2000's, it was anticipated that the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill in Maple Valley would run out of capacity in 2016. Largely through significant improvements in Waste reduction and recycling on the part of cities and the County, the life of the landfill has been extended through 2028. The Plan presents three viable future disposal options that could carry the region beyond 2028 and include the further development of Cedar Hills, exporting our waste to an out-of-county landfill, and siting and building a waste-to- energy (WTE) facility. We believe that it is our obligation to our rate-payers to maximize and exhaust the use of our existing resources and infrastructure before considering alternative methods of disposal. While waste export is a relatively affordable, tried and true disposal method in other neighboring jurisdictions such as Seattle and Snohomish County, we believe that it is our-responsibility to manage our own waste in our own county and so do not support the waste export alternative.

The Plan includes a recommendation to further develop Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity.United States and Europe, it is prohibitively expensive, requires a dependable stream of waste feedstocks, and comes with myriad of negative environmental impacts. lt should not be seriously considered as a reasonable disposal option in this Plan. We believe that the preponderance of the information and data presented in the Plan makes the further development of our landfill the best disposal option when weighed against waste export and incineration. We recommend the furtherdevelopment of Cedar Hill Regional Landfill to provide disposal of the regions' waste to at least 2040. Extending the life of the landfill is the most cost effective disposal option to keep disposal rates lowest. ltprovides for local management of the regions' waste, and allows adequate time to fully analyze future disposal options and emerging technologies around waste disposal Redmond supports expanding the Cedar Hills landfill to create additional solid waste disposal capacity at least through 2040. We urge King County to continue to explore solid waste disposal options to prepare for post- 2O4O, in addition to expanding Cedar Hills, as planning and implementation of a disposal option that requires construction of an additional facility or disposal outside of the county will require a significant amount of time. KCSWD set out three options in the Comp Plan for long-term solid waste disposal: (1) develop new capacity at Cedar Hills landfill (which corresponds with \"Alternative2\" for Landfill Management and Solid Waste Disposal in the EIS); (2) waste export to an out-of-cou nty la ndfill (which corresponds with \"Alternative 1\"); and (3) site, build, and operate a waste-to- energy facility (which corresponds with \"Alternative 3\"). The EIS presents two additional alternatives, both of which would implement emerging recovery technologies (anaerobic digestion and advanced materials recovery), however,Chapter 6 Chapter 6 Chapter 6Maple Valley t!o OoResponsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period c osoo =J N)o @1lo(cloo m IUrtr,KCSWD admits both have insufficient track records in reliably handling the amount of waste in King Coun$s system (Comp Plan 5- 31; EIS 5-3). Woodinville contends that Option (1) is the best available option based on existing information. One of the advantages of Option (1) is that it is the lowest cost option overall (Comp Plan 5-18; EIS 5-33). Not only is Option (1) more affordable, it also takes advantage of the KCSWD's experience in landfill operation and is consistent with county poliry to maximize the life of Cedar Hills landfill (Comp Plan 2-20,6-61. Yet another reason why Option (1) is the best path forward is that it has the lowest projected greenhouse gas emissions (Comp Plan 5-17). Options (2) and (3) are less desirable than Option (1). As an initial matter, the increased travel distances associated with Option (2) \"could result in greater cumulative vehicle emissions and potentially greater long-term air quality impacts\" (ElS 1-11, 5-8). Related to this concern, Woodinville requests the specific locations KCSWD is considering sending waste. The EIS states that the out-of- county disposal location would probably be in a rural area of eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, or ldaho (ElS 5-8), and the Comp Plan lists four specific \"potential locations\" for landfill disposal (6-8). lrrespective of the ultimate destination, however, Option (2) is not an attractive long- term solution because whatever disposal location the exported waste goes to will have a limited lifespan. Option (2) also presents challenges in terms of modifying transfer stations for rail-ready transport (Comp Plan 6-7; EIS 5-1). Moreover, the ElS indicates that rail capacity constraints may \"increase the need for capacity increases in the relevant rail corridors\" in 2O28 (ElS 1-12).

Rail capacity would also be an issue with Option (3) (Comp Plan 6-10). This rail capacity issue would not arise with Option (1), however, until 2O4O (ElS 1-11). Thus, Option (1) would provide policymakers with 12 more years to address rail capacity and to take advantage of waste disposal technology developed in those years. The EIS states that it is currently unknown what intermodal facilities Option (2) would rely upon to export waste but it is likely to be facilities located in south Seattle or south of Seattle near the existing BNSF Raikay and Union Pacific Railroad Tracks (ElS 5-26), Woodinville seeks to know if KCSWD is considering any other specific rail lines or facilities for all three options and how many facilities KCSWD anticipates would be required to sustain these options. Another negative effect associated with Option (2) is increased traffic-generating activities at intermodal facilities. Specifically, the EIS estimates that Option (2) could add L56 transfertrailer loads (312 trips) on an average weekday, and approximately 73 transfer trailer loads (146) trips in 2O28 on an average weekend day on local roads that provide access to the out-of-county landfill (ElS 5-26). Therefore, Woodinville currently supports Option (1), opposes Option (2), and seeks further information as KCSWD continues to evaluate the three options outlined in the Comp Plan. The City further encourages the County to continue to explore Option (3), a waste-to- energy facility, as a possible long-term solution along with others that promote efficient and effective service with minimal impacts to surrounding communities.

Landfills are the subject of controversyfor populations located in proximity of the landfill and are guaranteed to face fierce opposition when proposed for continued use, expansion or as new facilities. The energy consumption, wear and tear on roadways, noise and contribution to traffic congestion are all negative impacts of heavy vehicle trucking to landfills. All landfills have a limited life before they run out of capacity. The life- rycle costs of a waste to energy facility as compared to the continued use of landfills demonstrates a greater long-term cost benefit to the citizens of the county. The need to replace traditional energy sources with alternative energy has demonstrable environmental and sustainability benefits.

That isthe only long-range sustainable solution. Treatment needs to begin close to the points of origin, to reduce transportation costs and the volume of waste. Locally-hosted micro-treatment facilities, probably ones that employ cargo-containers, is the most likely alternative considering current technology today. Combining solid waste treatment with sanitary sewer conveyance systems allows for reduction of weight and leveraging recent technology advancements with aerobic microbes. Treatment of solid waste would become more rapid, efficient, and odorless using aerobic treatment processes. This is a win-win for both solid waste and sanitary waste treatment systems.

Still more costly alternatives include siting and building incineration or digestion systems, which produce energy as a by-product (but at a higher cost than existing power utilities, so lhis energy production could be categorized as \"cost subsidized\"). Further, these more expensive disposal options would still require landfill disposal of residuals or ash, along with related waste export infrastructure, so these related expenses should be accounted for consistently in cost comparisons. The Draft Plan estimates a capital cost of 51-Lbillion for a \"mass-burn\" incinerator - roughly four times higher capital cost than increasing permitted local landfill capacity from 2028 through 2040.

The Plan includes a recommendation to further develop Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity.The draft only has 3 options: Expand the landfill and lengthen its life thru new permitting. NOT my preference. This, to me, is a self serving option. King county permitting its own landfill to expand - how convenient. The way the options have been evaluated, it seems a foregone conclusion that the council will select this option. There seems to be a clause that states there must be a $90 million reserve for monitoring and maintenance AFTER the landfill is closed. To date, there is only $25 million. What has King county been doing all these years? Have they been dipping into it so as to pretty much guarantee there will never be enough to close it? ls the $9 million/year for financing refuse area development with rate dollars managed in the Landfill Reserye Fund why it's so low? I don't believe the County is truly serious about closing the landfill and will do anything necessary to keep it open and extend its life. lf it did, it would do more to fund this reserve. As it is, it looks like they may never have the required reserved. The draft stated that it needs to have a7 year period to begin to close the landfill and take into consideration all underlying contracts. Again, the county is not serious about closing the landfill. lf they had been they would have started the process for the current closing date, rather than squeeze out additional pits. Export - This option doesn't seem to be one the council would seriously consider, but it is our preferred option.We moved here in 1988 and at the time, we were told the landfill would close in 2000. 2000 came and went, and then it was 20L2, then 2028, and now 2040 (maybe). Cedar Grove was established AFTER we moved in and Cedar Mountain Reclamation just started up in the last couple years. My husband and I will be dead before Cedar Hills closes (if it ever does).

The team concurs that this is simply not accurate and true. Facts are ignored. Especially alarming are the false Greenhouse Gas emission volumes given for the Cedar Hills Landfill. From a scientific perspective, the climate is warming at an alarming and unnatural pace and Greenhouse Gases from landfills, including Cedar Hills are considerable contributors to Global Warming specifically in contrast to other viable and environmentally proven alternatives such as recycling, anaerobic digestion, energy and material recovery systems etc. The concept of Iandfilling is an outdated approach for handling modern waste appropriatelV. When assessing the true cost of landfilling untreated and still reactive solid waste, landfills are significantly more adverse and environmentally detrimental than other viable alternatives. The recent King County Waste-to- Energy/Waste Export Study (prepared by the Normandeau Team) made 27 recommendations that are vital in the process of evaluating viable economic-ecologic options. These key elements for King County were not included in either the DSWMP nor the DEIS. Without this information a proper evaluation cannot take place and the plan should be halted and updated accordingly. lt is essential that a comprehensive environmental and legally defensible analysis with an integration of these findings be undertaken The DSWMP does not enable but hinder the opportunity to build a working recycling infrastructure.

Recycling faces significant challenges and these are not adequately addressed in the plan. ln order to move towards a 7O/o recycling rate a much more aggressive local infrastructure is required including moving away from landfilline. It is important to know that the current DSWMP is focused on landfilling, which is the least sustainable option. Landfilling ranks lowest by the US EPA and comparable international waste management hierarchies. Landfilling offers the public the least viable/sustainable environmental option and is not economical when all costs and potential revenue streams are included. The Draft Solid Waste Management plan fails to address an integrated approach that offers many benefits in regards to the reductions in greenhouse gases and other environmental pollutants into air and ground, the creation of jobs, revenues, recovery of materials recycli ng/u pcycling and waste avoidance opportunities. These options will also eliminate the need for any additional landfill expansion and will save King County and its residents hundreds of millions of dollars. It does not seem that the DSWMP has been thoroughly updated and comprehensively reviewed for a number of years. For example, the Plan lacks current innovative and technical solutions. Considering that the Draft Environmental lmpact Statement (DEIS) is based on the Draft Solid Waste Management Plan, the DElS should be withdrawn and not be finalized. lt is not thorough, it is technically inaccurate, and not legally defensible. The DEIS process needs to be stopped immediately. First, it seems like the range of greenhouse gas emissions shown in the chart on 6-14 shows the range of emissions between 12,000 and 125,000 MTCO2e for the 20 year model for a waste to energy plant. However, I think the maximumPublic Review Draft Ghapter & Paqe Number Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 a \\.q o Oo-os@o (joResponse (Page numbers refer to the 2019 Plan) rounded to the nearest thousand). The higher number in the plan was for the 50-Vear scenario. Tonnage is projected to increase steadily after 2048 Other disposal options (such as export) could be considered beyond 2048 instead of building an additional mass burn facility but the total disposal cost per ton for that combination option would add the cost ofthe parallel disposal system to the continuing operation cost for the original mass burn facility. No, having two different systems would not be more expensive than having two waste to energy facilities. The Normandeau report includes information that could be used to do this analvsis. Thank you for your comment Ihe 2Ot7 Normandeau report estimated that in year 20 (actually, the 21st year when all bonds are paid off) the cost per ton for the mass burn facility drops to purely operating cost. However, the capacity of the mass burn facility also is fully used in year 20. An additional expanded mass burn facility must be built to handle the growing waste in the regional system in year 21 and beyond. Showing only the 2048 operating cost for the first mass burn facility does not account for the full cost of disposal given that significant new capital investment (and operating cost) must be undertaken for a new mass burn facility. So in Figure 6-9 to show an approx. ZO-year apples-to-apples comparison with export we did not show either the drop of the bond payments for the first mass burn facility or the new capital cost for the additional mass burn facility. A footnote to Figure 6- t has been added to say that the waste-to-energyGomment MTCO2e in the model was 80,000. The 125,000 MTCO2e comes from the 50 year model. lf there was too much waste for the capacity of the WTE facility in 2048, it seems like other disposal options could be considered correct? ls capacity projected to increase well above the 4,000 ton capacity after 2048? Would having two different systems be more expensive than two WTE facilities? ls there analysis on this? We are strongly opposed to a waste-to-energy option. This does not make sense from an environmental or economic perspective at this time. Second, the chart on the 6-17 shows the cost/ton for WTE as S121 at year 20. However, in the model the cost/ton is S37 in year 20.Public Review Draft Chapter & Paqe Number Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 - Disposal Chapter 6 - Disposal, p.6-17Commenter SCA SCA Zero Waste WA scAlrl I l\\, Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period o o_- o)foo @ !

Clean plastic bags and plastic films can be recycled now by putting them in larger plastic bags and placed in blue recycle toters. The people at the store have been very helpful about telling me where I can recycle items that they do not take-like old oil and car batteries. As I am able to recycle or compost almost all of my household waste, I have very little garbage and have Bone to having a monthly pickup for more than a year now. I also pick up and recycle or compost items that is litter along SE 56th St. People are dumping all kinds of items along the roadside, so I appreciate being also able to take items such as old tires, large metal pieces, and even chunks of concrete or asphalt to occasional nearby recycling events. I wish people wouldn't litter because it is a lot of work to pick up all their trash, sort it, and clean it enough so that it is suitable for recycling or copposting, but it is good that I am dble to get rid of most of it.

The County should not limit itself to three options and should also consider a fourth option: alternative waste diversion and conversion technologies. The County has been keeping its finger on the pulse of emerging technologies and should give itself the option to pursue these alternative technologies within the scope of the Plan. There may be substantial benefit, both financially and otherwise, in King County exporting a portion of the municipal solid waste earlier in the process, in parallel to extending the life of the Cedar Hills Landfill. The County could consider bifurcating the management of the solid waste stream - a portion to Cedar Hills and another segment of waste to be exported to an out-of-county landfill. This strategy would present the County with another option than the choices offered in the Plan. WMW once again requests that the Greater Wenatchee Regional Landfill (Wenatchee LF) be included in the table of potential locations for out-of-county landfill disposal. See information to be added at the end of this comment. Wenatchee LF currently processes 350,000 tons peryear and not 175,000 tons of refuse per year as the County indicated in its response to our first set of Plan comments, dated November 3,2OLl. Wenatchee LF is currently also a King County designated landfill for construction and demolition debris disposal. We would also like to note that Wenatchee LF is 157 rail miles from Seattle, which is half the distance of the closest landfill as identified in the Table 6-L, and it is the closest rail-served regional landfill.

What portion of those costs are for metal recovery is not available from these planning level estimates. Yes the revenue and costs are factored into the cost per ton projections.

This table has been removed from the Plan. This table has been removed from the Plan Yes, the WTE option initially is built to reach capacity in year 20. Bypass waste and ash would be exported throughout the life of the WTE facility. The operators of the WTE facility could seek outside waste until waste from our regional system uses the facility's full capacity. For year 21 and beyond, an additional decision would be needed to build additional WTE capacity, export any municipal solid waste beyond the capacity of the initial facility, or use alternative disposal approaches.Presumably the 5229 million in capital costs won't be spent \"as soon as\" approval ofcell construction occurs. tt would instead be spent over the period of time during cell construction that creates landfill capacity until 2040. Please consider clarifying this period of time. This footnote appears to be the only text reference to \"Area 9\" in the Plan. There is an \"Area 9\" represented in Figure 2.5, but it is likely different than the area that would be used in expanding capacity to 2O4O, so please add explanatory text. It is not clear why the 2017 capital amount is higher than the future amount. Do these figures compare, or do they come from a different base? This note seems to indicate that the WTE option overbuilds initial capacity and requires waste import to run all four 1000 ton per day lines. (lt doesn't appear that the intent is to not start one of the 1,000 ton per day lines for several years). Whatis the year when our system-generated MSW provides sufficient input that makes it economical to begin operating that fourth line solely on waste generated within our system? (Presumably the fourth line is not started just for our daily MSW ton #3,001). At 4,000 tons per day, operating continuously, WTE would process over 1.4 million tons of MSW. While WTE facility downtime will mean a lower total tonnage will be burned in practice, Figure 3.3 doesn't show when that level of \"tons disposed\" will be reached - presumablv it would be vears past 2040.

Typically a 'put or pay' cost structure applies to WTE facility economics, meaning if tonnage minimums are not met, penalties or paymerits are still assessed. lf factors like the economy or WRR efforts mean there is not enough waste coming into the WTE plant to cover the bond costs and operation costs, or to operate at peak efficiency levels used inthis Plan's projections, who pays for this shortfall?

However, there are significant drawbacks to this proposal including: l. lt is much more difficult to measure volume than tonnage accurately. 2. The additional processing could impact wait times, personnel requirements and require additional equipment. 3. There may be \"equity'' issues due to differences in degree of compacting.

Unlike the last adopted Comp Plan, this Plan includes a new chapter, Chapter 2 The Existing Solid Waste System. This chapter discusses how the entire system works together while later chapters focus on specific parts ofthe system such as sustainable materials management, transfer, and disposal. King County returns the valuable nutrients and carbon from biosolids - a nutrient-rich organic product of wastewater treatment - to the land as a soil conditioner for agriculture and forestry. A portion of the biosolids are also composted by a private company and sold as compost for use in landscaping and gardening. These approaches contribute to sustainability by using biosolids to enrich soils, keeping them productive and healthy. The regional system relies on public and private participants, with private collection and processing companies responsible for ensuring that recyclable materials are reused under their contracts with the cities and county. For example, the division's contract for processing of recyclables from county transfer stations states \"The Contractor shall ensure that all of the recyclable materials collected from SWD sites are recycled per King County Code [KCC 10.04.020 DDDDI, which specifies that recycling of materials remanufacturing, reprocessi ng, com posti ng or re-refi ni n g materials into usable or marketable products, and marketing or distributing those products or commodities forfrom, information and empirical data presented inthe Plan and from comments received from cities and the public. This letter and the attached marked u p copy ofthe Draft Comprehensive Plan constitute my official comments. The final report should be integrated and not siloed. The items that cannot be recycled should be put in a modern waste to energy plant, so they are recycled in that manner, produce power and dispose of the matter so it is not left for future generations to deal with. There should be a sustainability model wherein biosolids are also used as fuel. There are toxins and pharmaceuticals in biosolids. The impact of the combinations of all these chemicals is unknown and leaves our land with potential for contamination. The European Union does not allow lands application of biosolids. We need to follow their example. The lifecycle of our recycled products should be documented.

Some materials were collected in separate bins when local recycling programs first began. Since the early 2000s curbside recyclables have been collected in one bin and the co-mingled recyclables brought to Material Recovery Facilities to be sorted, baled, and sold to be made into new products. The one-bin approach greatly increased the regional recycling rate but it relies on customers making the right choices about placing in their blue bin only materials accepted by their jurisdiction's recycling program that are empty, clean, and dry. The division and its advisory committees have convened a Responsible Recycling Task Force to explore reducing contamination through more recycling consistency among jurisdictions, and customer reminders about recycling best practices, and other means. Various choices regarding the size of a waste to energy plant were offered in the Normandeau 2017 report. Given the lengthy siting and construction process and need for disposal certainty over a reasonable time period, the waste to energy option assumed a facility that can handle county tons for at least 20 years before reaching capacity, after which an additional waste to energy plant or other disposal option would be needed. Twenty years also is more consistent with the plan's planning horizon and allows comparison of the three disposal options over roughlV the same time period.

The cost of increased height isThe new announcement by China that they are not going to use as much or potentially any of our recycled products could have an impact on our recycling rate and potentially increase the materials that will go into our landfill. One of their- concerns is that our separation methods allows for contamination of the materials. I have seen very different sorting methods in Germany and Denmark, which produces a cleaner product to be on the market and compete with our recyclables. Many of the suppositions given in this draft report need to be reconsidered. For instance the tonnage capacity of a waste to energy plant does not need to be built at the beginning for anticipated tonnage overthe next 20 years. We have no way of knowing what changes will happen in packaging, regulations, recycling, reuse, etc. So building so much extra capacity is not necessary. We should model after waste to energy plants in Florida and Hamburg. They provide us with a clear, documented data system that is sustainable and we can measure the environmental impacts in a much more accurate and efficient waythan landfills. Our landfill is quickly filling up. Going up another 50 feet will have impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods and on costs.Public Fleview Draft Chapter & Paqe Number General General Genera ICommenter Kathy Lambert Kathy Lambertincluded in the costs for the Further Develop Cedar Hills option.

A waste to energy plant contains the materials and disposes of most of the matter here and provides certainty and predictability. lf we built a waste to energy plant now, it would allow us to use our current capacity to accept the fly ash until we can update our codes to be in line with European standards and science to declare it inert. Flyash is also needed in cement and there would be a market for it. ln addition, our bottom ash could be used for road construction. Our 1,500 miles of roads are in need of repair and in places reconstruction. Havirgthis readily available product for road bed would be another asset.

This chapter discusses how the entire system works together while later chapters focus on specific parts ofthe system such as sustainable materials management, transfer, and disposal. The regional system relies on public and private participants, with private collection and processing companies responsible for ensuring that recyclable materials are reused under their contracts with the cities and county. For example, the division's contract for processing of recyclables from county transfer stations states \"The Contractor shall ensure that all of the recyclable materials collected from SWD sites are recycled per King County Code [KCC 10.04.020 DDDDI, which specifies that recycling of materials includes transforming, remanufacturing, reprocessing, composting or re-refining materials into usable or marketable products, and marketing or distributing those products or commodities for use other than landfill, incineration, stockpiling, or as a fuel...\"lnformation on the lifecycle of rerycled products. a Discussion of available system improvements or technological advancements that can maximize recycling and minimize landfill use (including waste to energy, byproduct sale to industry, etc.)As we go fonvard we need to see how we can integrate our system and use these materials for power, for'sale to other industries such asthe cement industry and metals for reuse.

We envision a just and sustainable world where society responsibly produces, consumes and recycles. We applaud the overall approach and the waste prevention hierarchy. We are concerned, however, that the recycling rate has plateaued. We would like to see much stronger policies and actions in the plan to stimulate increasing the recycling rate (even though there is a challenge with the China Sword initiative at the moment). The CSWMP presents a very detailed analysis of the recent status, challenges, and proposes several alternatives for future development and how King County deals with solid waste, recycling, and related issues. The main challenge centers around the Cedar Hills Landfill Facility capacity and projected life based on estimated waste volumes in the coming decades. ZWV is proposing that King County prioritize a de-centralized waste management approach which uses an integrated Regional - Distributed system. ln order to reduce waste going to the central landfill, ZWV recommends that King County improve and expand the existing waste disposal / recycling infrastructure to increase local recycling rates, divert more organic materials to existing and new distributed local composting and anaerobic digestion systems, and greatly expanding waste diversion approaches such as ReUse facilities. lncreasing the number and accessibility of local facilities will decrease overall waste transportation costs, road congestion and wear, greenhouse gas production and waste volumes needing disposal at the Cedar Hills Landfill.General Zero Waste Vashonmr oN Responsiveness Summary: Responses to formal comments made during the January 8 - March 8, 2018 public comment period t!o \\o llo(oooo)oThank you for your comments.

The City of Kirkland appreciates the work the Local Hazardous Waste Management Program (LHWMP) has done to reduce the impacts of moderate risk hazardous wastes on our environment through providing our residents and businesses with a reliable, safe, and responsible disposal option through a permanent drop-off location at the new Factoria Transfer Station and through periodic Wastemobile visits to the northeast County. ln February, through the Sound Cities Association, the Kirkland City Council and staffwere made aware of and surprised by a proposed 50.4% increase in the LHWMP fee schedule charged via a flat fee to our residents and variably to businesses based upon theirservice levels. As proposed, the fee increase would take effect in 2019 and be implemented incrementally over a six year period. The proposed increase also adds to the per-ton fees charged to private and commercial haulers at all transfer stations which has a direct impact on the rates cities charge to their customers. We have serious concerns about the general lack of communication and transparency on the part of LHWMP to its cities with solid waste interlocalagreements concerning the fee increase and the apparent lack of any tangible or meaningful improvement in services provided to our ratepayers in NE King County.

Beck 2007), the Woste-to-Energy Study (Normandeou 2017), and an updated Cedor Hills Site DevelopmentAlternotives Final Report (KCSWD 2O!7a) to identify three options to meet the county's disposal needs after currently permitted capacity at Cedar Hills is used. A long-term disposal method was selected from the following three options: Further develop Cedar Hills, Waste Export, and Waste to Energy (Mass Burn) Facility Further Develop Cedar Hills This option would further develop Cedar Hills to maximize disposal capacity, extending the county's SO-year practice of managing its waste locally. To account for emerging technologies, the next disposal method would not be specified, but criteria would be established for selecting the next disposal method. This option is consistent with county policy to maximize the life of the Cedar Hills landfill. The ConversionTechnology Report (R.W. Beck 2007) and more recent division analysis concluded that Cedar Hills disposal is the most economical way to handle King County's waste. Other advantages include the division's experience in landfill operation, availability of space in a county-owned landfillwith state of the art environmental controls, and collection of landfill gas to produce renewable energy. Challenges with this option include obtaining new or modified permits to authorize further development, relocating buildings to make room for refuse, and continuing to be good neighbors for the surrounding community. Features used in the re-evaluation ofthis option include: New landfill cells would be developed at the Cedar Hills landfill, The permit and the landfill would be modified to increase the height of the landfill from approximately 800 feet to 830 feet, to the extent that such modification would be consistent with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, which requires King County to make a good faith effort to keep the maximum height of areas 5, 6, and 7 of the Landfill at or below 788 feet above sea level, Division facilities currently located in areas permitted for refuse disposal would be moved, High-efficiency collection systems would continue to deliver landfill gas to the Bio-Energy Washington facility, resulting in pipeline-quality natural gas, revenue for the division, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, The added capacity would be sufficient to handle the forecast tonnage, maximizing disposal capacity at the landfill, Consistent with long-standing practice, new development would be financed through rate revenues managed in the landfill reserve fund, As Cedar Hills reaches capacity, previously described evaluation criteria would be used to select the next disposal method, and A new disposal method would need to be ready for service when the new capacity at Cedar Hills is exhausted.a a a a a a a zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid lYaste Management Plan -Jufu zot9 Att A Page 365F-1Ordinance 18893 Updated April 17,2019 Waste Export This option would export waste to an out-of-county landfill after currently permitted capacity at Cedar Hills is used in 2028. Current county policy establishes export to an out-of-county landfill as the choice for disposal after closure of the Cedar Hills landfill. Waste export by rail is a proven disposal option used by neighboring jurisdictions, including the City of Seattle and Snohomish County. There are several regional landfills available by rail with combined capacity sufficientto handle the county's waste in the long term. (Table 6-lXKCSWD 20!7c). This option would transfer a significant portion of the County's waste management activities into the private sector for long haul and landfilling. Challenges include modifying transfer stations for rail-ready transport, cost, lead time needed for contracting and division operational changes, and potential rail service disruptions that might arise from rail capacity constraints and weather events. Features of this option include: . The county would enter into a contract to export waste after current permitted capacity at Cedar Hills is used by 2028, o Waste would be exported to a yet-to-be determined out-of-county landfill, . The out-of-county landfillwould produce energyfrom landfill gas using an efficient collection system, . The county would negotiate revenue sharing or energy credits with the out-of-county landfill for the county's share of waste that produces landfill gas that is then harvested for energy, r Waste would be transported to the out-of-county landfill by rail, the preferred transport mode, based on travel time, equipment requirements, payload, and capital costs (KCSWD 2OI7cl, r The division would buy container-ready trailers to transport rented rail-ready containers from transfer stations to a rail intermodal facility, .

As discussed previously, a recent study identified a mass burn facility as the best waste to energy technology for consideration by King County (Normandeau 2017). This option would reduce waste 90 percent by volume and 75 percent by weight, while offsetting some costs through sale of electricity and increasing recycling by as much as two percent. Challenges include facility siting, cost, providing guaranteed amounts of feedstock, having unused capacity at the beginning of the operating period with potential inefficient operation during periods when less capacity is used, possible shutdowns due to waste deliveries below the system's requirements, rail capacity constraints for ash and bypass waste export, and other factors. Features of this option include: r For the first 20 years of operation (2028-2048), the facility would be designed to minimize waste that bypasses the facility because it is too bulky or exceeds facility capacity, resulting in a 5,000 tons-per-day plant built on a 4O-acre site with five lines that could handle 1,000 tons per day each, . To handle forecast tons, additional capacity would be required beyond 2048, or sooner if the actual tonnage increases faster than forecast, . The mass burn facility would include a tipping floor, pre-incineration screening of non-processable materials at transfer stations, an infeed hopper, combustion chamber, ash collection, metals recovery, and emissions scrubbing systems that use activated carbon and selective catalytic reduction technologies to keep dioxin and other potential emissions below permit limits, . The facility would burn municipal solid waste to produce steam, which turns an electrical turbine to create electricity. Washington State does not currently consider electricity from a mass burn facility as renewable, . The ash produced as a by-product of the process would be screened to recover all remaining metal for recycling, r After screening, ash would be transported to an out-of-county landfill where it would be buried separate from the municipal solid waste in an ash monofill. Various groups are researching beneficial use of incinerator ash; however, in Washington State the ash must be disposed in an ash monofill, and r Non-processable and bypass waste would be transported to an out-of-county landfill. Solid Waste Management Plan -July zotS F-4 April 17,2019 Waste-to-Energy in King County and the United States ln the late 1980s, both King County and the City of Seattle planned to convert from burying municipal solid waste in a landfill to sending waste to a mass burn facility. Protests by the public and environmental groups led both j,ur:isdictions to abandon plansto bu,ild mass burn facilities and instead shift er:nphasis to recycling and waste red:uction, along with exploring waste export to out-of-county landfil,ls. However, during the past decade, technological advances in mass burn facilities and the ernergence of other potentially viabl,e waste conversion technologies have resulted in renewed interest in th,ese options for long-term disposal once Cedar Hills has reached its permitted capacity. fhe King County Woste-to-Energy Study (Normandeau 2017) identified a mass burn facility as the best waste-to-e:nerg! technology to consider for the county's solid waste system. There are 77 individual waste-to-energy facilities in 22 states listed i,n the Energy Recovery Council2016 DirectoryofWastetoEnergyFocilrties(ERC2016).Sixtyof th,efacilitiesare m,assburn, 13are ref use-derived fuel, and four are modular. Mass burn is the most common waste-to-energy technology, representing 78 percent of the industry technology in the United States. Most facilities were built before 1996. The most recent plant was built in Florida in 2011 (operational in 2015) and is a 3,000 tons per day facility. ln the United States, $,000 tons per day is the upper capacity limit on the aging facilities from the 1990s. Small units with capacity of 1,000 tons per day or less have been built and some have been redesigned to expand capacity. A 5,000 ton per day facility, as proposed for King County, would be the largest mass burn facility in the United States. zotg Cotnprehensiue Solid Wtste Managentent Plan 18893 Updated April '17 ,2019 Appendix G Agency Plan Review Letters Att A Page 370Ordinance 18893 Updated wa:te handlirg and waste Management Plan -Juj zodl : :tI 1 t Att Chapter ? it,worrld be good to build in a map ,or 376Ordinance Updated April 17, 2019 Service Date: February 8,2018 STATE OF WASHINGTON UTILITI ES AND TRANSPORTATION S.

Staff reviewed this plan and the prior cost assessment questionnaire under the previous Docket, TG-180044. The cost assessment questionnaire porlion was updated at the request of Department of Ecology due to the fact that the plan period began in2077, which was one full year out of date when filed with the Commission. There was a relatively large change to the overall recycling rate in this revised cost assessment. From 2017 to 2018, the recycling rate dropp ed 5 .4 percent, to an overall recycling rate of 52 percent. This is due to a 14 percent increase in garbage tonnage disposed, and an 8 percent reduction in recycling tons processed. The County proposes two tip fee increases at all King County transfer stations during the 2018 - 2023 Plan period. These tip fee increases are expected to occur in 2020 and 2023.

The population density of each area serviced by a city operation or by a franchised operation within the respective jurisdictions; Appendix A, page 4-L, includes the population projections for the entire King County system. The area served by the regional system, including cities and the unincorporated areas, is shown in Figure 2-1, page2-2. Chapter 3 discusses the current and projected population of areas served by the transfer stations (which encompasses all of the cities and urban areas). The City of Enumclaw provides solid waste collection to a population of 11,490. The City of Skykomish services a population on 200. Plation of areas served UTC-lated haulers include 4. The projected solid waste collection needs for the respective jurisdictions for the next six years; o Chapter 3 includes details of solid waste generation projections for the future.o Chapter 4 discusses current and future collection issues (pages 4-21, to 4-35).o Table 4-4, on page 4-22 and 4-23, includes information on haulers, contracts, and collection needs/service types in each jurisdiction. 5. Analysis of operating economics, travel distances and economically optimal locations of solid waste facilities; Route efficiency is essential to operating economics, travel distances, and economically optimal locations of solid waste facilities as described below:a a a a a Chapter 5 discusses planning for the Transfer System. Figure 5-L, page 5-2, shows where each of the transfer facilities and Cedar Hills Landfill is located. The map shows that the facilities are well-distributed to maximize the efficiency of the system.

The Plan discusses the Level of Service criteria (including travel distance, which is an indicator of route efficiency) and siting criteria (developed as part of the Solid Waste Transfer and Waste Management Plan) that will be used in the siting process. These criteria take operating economics and location into account. A map, Census Tract Travel Time to Nearest Solid Waste Transfer Station, included on page H-7, shows that the travel times to the nearest station meet the Level of Service criteria. This criterion indicates how conveniently located the facilities are for customers {including commercial haulers concerned with maximizing route efficiency), measured by the maximum travel time to the closest facility in their service area. The standard was established as 30 minutes for at least 90 percent of the customers. lt provides an indication of whether the transfer stations are well dispersed throughout the county. G. A review of potential areas that meet the siting criteria as outlined in RCW 70.95.165. The siting process for the NERTS has not progressed to a point where any potential sites have been identified. A budget request to start a preliminary siting process was submitted for Council consideration, but has not yet been approved. o The Plan discusses the siting process (pages 5-18 through 5-20) that was used for the South County Recycling and Transfer Station and will be adapted for NERTS. o Action 1-t also states that the siting criteria identified in the Solid Waste Transfer and Waste Management Plan, Appendix C, will be adapted to meet the community needs in siting a new NERTS. Appendix C identifies the same elements to review that are included in RCW 70.95.1..
