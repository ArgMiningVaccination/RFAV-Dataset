Reasons to Love Tulsi There are so many things about this vibrant green plant to love\u2014from the many [benefits of tulsi](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/plants/ayurvedic-herbs/tulsi-holy-basil-benefits/), to its rich and fascinating history, to its breathtaking (or since it has an affinity for the lungs, breath-giving) beauty! In appearance, the tulsi plant boasts lush purple blossoms that jut out from its verdant green leaves, not unlike the towers and turrets of an enchanted castle. Likewise enchanting is its smell\u2014which some have described as minty, with hints of citrus and licorice. With its striking appearance and enticing smell, it's no surprise that tulsi plants are often surrounded by bees, whose drones as they busily work to pollenate can provide a soothing tone that only makes the experience of walking through a tulsi field all the more magical. At [Banyan Farm](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/plants/farms-sourcing/banyan-botanicals-farm/), tulsi grows in abundance, and is regularly serenaded not only by bees, but by the [Living Ayurveda Interns](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/plants/farms-sourcing/internship/). On some evenings, interns can be found in the tulsi fields singing to the plants, practicing an Agnihotra ceremony, or having lively conversations in the presence of this majestic herb. Given tulsi's history as a deeply spiritual plant that has been worshipped across cultures, it's no surprise that all of us at Banyan\u2014interns and bees included\u2014can't get enough of it. Oh, Holy Basil! Spiritual Properties of Tulsi Tulsi is also known by its Latin name, Ocimum sanctum, or by the name tulasi. However, there is one name it goes by that goes a long way to illustrate the place of reverence this plant holds around the world\u2014the name \"holy basil.\" Why is tulsi called holy basil? Well, the word \"basil\" derives from \"basileus,\" a Greek word that means \"royal\" or \"king,\" [1](#_edn1) and common basil itself (Ocimum basilicum) is considered a spiritually significant plant in some cultures, having been used to make holy water and bless church altars in the Greek Orthodox religion and throughout Eastern Europe. [2](#_edn2) \"Sanctum,\" or \"holy,\" is a reference to tulsi's spiritual significance across so many cultures\u2014since this plant is so often associated with holiness around the world. Tulsi in the East Tulsi's presence is steeped within many ancient Indian myths, and some spiritual traditions consider tulsi to be the embodiment of the goddess Lakshmi, with her spiritual powers infused within the plant. [3](#_edn3) Because of this belief, you could say that owning a tulsi plant is like caring for a living blessing that constantly purifies your home. It is no wonder tulsi is grown in many home courtyards throughout India, where it is offered gratitude and reverence as part of daily puja (worship). In fact, the lack of a tulsi plant in a courtyard is considered by some to give a feeling of emptiness and dullness in the home. [4](#_edn4) Tulsi is also present in some big life transitions in Indian culture. Tulsi plays a huge role in kick-starting the wedding season across the country. Only after the completion of Tulsi Vivaha (the yearly ritual in which the tulsi plant is symbolically wed to Lord Vishnu) is it considered a good time to start planning a wedding. Thanks to its purifying nature, tulsi is also present at a much different juncture\u2014at the deathbed. By placing tulsi upon the dying person, it is said to help cleanse the soul and stop the cycle of death and rebirth. [5](#_edn5) Tulsi in the West Tulsi's recognition as a deeply spiritual herb goes beyond India's borders and is even rooted in some profound legends within Christianity. For example, tulsi is said to have greeted Christ's disciples at his tomb after his crucifixion\u2014the tomb was empty, but the surrounding countryside was carpeted with blooming tulsi. A few hundred years later, the mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine found a hill similarly covered in this aromatic plant. According to legend, hidden under this hill was the cross of Christ. From these legends, tulsi became a Christian symbol of holiness and spiritual birth and is still used to this day in Christian rituals. [6](#_edn6) For example, as a powerful purifier, it has a role in the Greek Orthodox tradition of preparing holy water. [7](#_edn7) Tulsi in Ayurveda [Ayurveda](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/learning-ayurveda/intro-to-ayurveda/) certainly recognizes the sacred nature of tulsi. Its Sanskrit name translates as \"the incomparable one.\" This could be interpreted in several ways, but perhaps it simply means there are literally no comparisons or substitutions for this herb and what it has to offer. After all, tulsi is high in sattva\u2014the principle of light, perception, and clarity. This could explain its rather inspiring power to heighten awareness and mental clarity, as well as its unique ability to open the mind and heart to love and devotion. (We bet you're enjoying your tea on a whole new level now!) Tulsi the Adaptogen Tulsi is among a group of super-herbs known in Ayurveda known as adaptogens, or [adaptogenic herbs](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/blog-the-banyan-insight/details/adaptogenic-herbs-of-ayurveda/).
