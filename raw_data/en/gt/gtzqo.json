The homeopathic model of treatment is based on three pillars: 'principle of similitude', 'experimentation of substances in healthy individuals' and 'dynamized medicines'. For a drug to be considered 'homeopathic', it should be potentiated (dynamized), experienced in healthy individuals and applied according to the principle of the similarity of symptoms.\" In order to escape from the aggravation and intoxication caused by substances used in ponderal doses, Hahnemann started to dilute and agitate them (method of dynamization), observing that through this process the substances produced the same symptomatic manifestations. In this way, a dynamized preparation had the same effect as that of the mother tincture and produced similar reactions in the organisms. However, many drugs prepared in this manner are diluted to such an extent that they go beyond Avagadro's number. Hence the action of homeopathic drugs, even though clinically manifested, was always debated in scientific community.Source: - Attarwala H, Bathija D, Akhil A, Philip B, Mathew A, Ahmed KK.

Parasites? These organisms can remain in your body, buried in your organs and tissues, doing damage to your health. Years later, life-threatening illnesses can result. For example, if a child contracts Chicken Pox virus and he/she is not strong enough to expel it completely, the virus remains in the body and over the years attacks the Parathyroid gland. The gland then becomes inflamed, creating problems with other glands. Inflammation of the parathyroid gland causes it to secrete excess parathyroid hormone. This results in elevated calcium in the blood, which causes calcium to be drawn from the bones, which in turn leads to severe Osteoporosis. When this occurs, the best diet, supplement and exercise regime will not stop continued deterioration of the skeleton. Further, this excess calcium becomes deposited in the soft tissue, resulting in clogging of the arteries, kidney and gall bladder stones deposited in the joints and osteoarthritis. All of this due to an attack of chicken pox decades earlier! Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is another example of the damage infections can inflict on your body. The Townsend Letter for Doctors has stated, \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is primarily a result of an accumulation of infections resulting in an overloading of the immune system. Viral infection is the main culprit. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) heads the list. Most CFS is marked by low thyroid function and EBV is usually the infection that interferes with thyroid function. EBV can account for many of the secondary symptoms, such as food intolerances, anxiety and other mental symptoms.\" Each infection weakens the immune system and eventually overwhelms it. The result is catastrophic illness. We are shocked because the illness seems to come 'out of the blue'. However, it has been developing most of our life. These chronic infections play a major role in most major diseases and our eventual death. What we do not know or feel can hurt us and even kill us.\" Another American scientist, R.J. Marshall Ph.D, agrees. He states, \"Mounting evidence now links viruses and bacteria to gallstones. Viruses and bacteria may play a major role in many chronic diseases where infection was never suspected before. In our lifetime, we have seen bacteria and viruses firmly linked to many diseases such as ulcers (Helicobacter Pylori), liver cancer (Hepatitis B and C viruses), cervical cancer (Papilloma virus) and Leukemia (HTLV-1 virus). Strong evidence now links infectious agents to chronic diseases we once thought were caused solely by genes and lifestyle. For example, Pennsylvania scientists have discovered the same bacterium, Chlamydia pneumoniae, in the brains of Alzheimer's victims. Epidermologists have found the majority of heart disease patients have been infected with the same common bacterium, Chlamydia pneumoniae. Some researchers have concluded that up to 80% of heart disease is linked to infections. New research strongly links infection to many diseases, including gallstones (Clostridia), kidney stones (Nanobacteria), Crone's disease (Mycoplasma pneumoniae), juvenile diabetes (Coxackie B virus), schizophrenia (Brona and Influenza virus), breast cancer (Mammary Tumor virus) and many others.\" Research from these and other bodies of information has helped me develop the best course of action for these conditions. First I find it important to clear the system of any current bugs using specific herbal combinations. Secondly (and at the same time) I boost the immune system to protect the liver from any die-back symptoms. The third action is to prescribe the Auto Iso Nosode Therapy, a therapy which uses your own blood to make a homoeopathic remedy. It appears that via the practice of Homoeopathy is the only way that these long-standing infections can be cleared up. The principles are not new (they have been known for over 70 years) but now is the time we need this specialised technique to help us fight these modern day diseases. The idea is to stimulate the bodies' own immune system so it will produce the necessary antibodies to combat the old residues of the disease. By using a fingerprick of the client's blood, the homeopathic remedy ensures an individualised treatment for those \"bugs\" that may be stopping the client from feeling 100%. This treatment has a very good record of success, with many excellent testimonials. By utilising the new knowledge available about organism clearing, I find that it is an advantage to incorporate each of the above three phases of the treatment to optimise treatment response, response time and client comfort during the process. All of these techniques can be further enhanced by incorporating Colon Therapy, which will assist the body to regenerate faster by flushing out the dead and dying organisms. I also find it is essential before starting a clearance program of these bugs to take a live blood analysis to determine the degree of effect the old bugs are having on the bodies' system and to give me the opportunity to discuss the program extensively with the client (and also take the blood sample for the remedy). I have used the Auto Iso Nosode technique for many years. I was recently inspired to use it more often because there have been many clients coming in to the clinic for a live blood analysis who have had trouble clearing current infections (because their old viruses were still having an effect on their immune systems). If you would like to check your immune system or help clear your old viruses, then call me to book in for a live blood analysis...and start on your path to feeling great!

Because as we all know that Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. So, what happens is that once the carcinocin of Specific part is introduced to the patient of cancer of specific part it covers all the symptoms of the disease of the specific part as well as the miasm. So it is a smilimum . As we all know that in the pap of the Uterus taken from the cancer patient contatins all the factors which can cause the cancer of utereus Including its pathogen to the damaged cells of the Uterus. So, the pap of the cancer patient has the power to produce cancer in the other women if introduced? Clinical Trail of Carcinocin Pap Uterus 30 c on 100 patients of--Cancer of the Uterus Objective TO establish the positive role of Carcinocin Pap Uterus 30 c in diagnosed cases of Cancer of Uterus Method- Diagnosed cases of Cancer of Uterus were taken in which the cancer was either diagnosed in the ultrasound ,C.T scan or the MRI report. The size of the tumor was noted along with the intensity of pain and the amount bleeding. The medicine was given 2 drops 4 to 6times a day as required for 3 months..According to the condition of the patient which was accessed by the bleeding and pain . The ultrasound was done every month for the safety of the patient but the result was only taken in the trail after 3 months. Result Number of Patients Entered- 100 No of Patients who followed the protocol- 86 Number of Patients who improved were -78 Rate of Response to Carcinocin Pap Uterus is -90.69 % Why to go for Homeopathic Treatment even after the removal of Organs effected from Cancer ? We all know that according to homeopathy in a patient who has the cancer in the uterus .It is the image produced to the disturbance of the vital force. If the uterus is removed there are all changes that after a certain timeif may appear as a cancer growth in Ovary or in breast. Only it is the matter of time. Suppose the patient has the cancer of the uterus and all the uterus, ovary and the fallopian tube is removed. Then too if the homeopathic treatment is not given there are many chances that it may develop in the breast or any other part of the body because the cause -which is the derangement of the vital force is not addressed. Many of the patients do not see the direct result because suppose the patints uterus is removed at a age of 60 years.Then the average life is 80 years. If the cancer is slow spreading type and if it has taken 20 years to develop in the uterus it will take another 20 years to develope in some other part. By the patient has died due to age. Word of Caution: This clinical study does not mean that other Symptomatic remedies do not respond. This is a pilot study and was done to proove the efficacy of Carcinocin pap Uterus . Cinical Materia Medica of Carcinocin pap Uterus ---after studying 100 cases of Cancer of Uterus.

Dynamized Preparations Nagar, Thrissur, Kerala-680 555, Although reports on the efficacy of homeopathic medicines in animal models are limited, there are even fewer reports on the in vitro action of these dynamized preparations. We have evaluated the cytotoxic activity of 30C and 200C Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines and compared activity with their mother tinctures during short-term and long-term cell culture. The effect of dynamized medicines to induce apoptosis was also evaluated and we studied how dynamized medicines affected genes expressed during apoptosis. Mother tinctures as well as some dynamized medicines showed significant cytotoxicity to cells during short and long-term incubation. Potentiated alcohol control did not produce any cytotoxicity at concentrations studied. The dynamized medicines were found to inhibit CHO cell colony formation and thymidine uptake in L929 cells and those of Thuja, Hydrastis and Carcinosinum were found to induce apoptosis in DLA cells. Moreover, dynamized Carcinosinum was found to induce the expression of p53 while dynamized Thuja produced characteristic laddering pattern in agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA. These results indicate that dynamized medicines possess cytotoxic as well as apoptosis-inducing properties. Recently, limited investigations on the efficacy of dynamized medicines in animal models as well as clinical trials have reported that potentiated Lycopodium clavatum has protective action against CCl4-induced liver damage in rats and that chelidonium 30C could ameliorate both p-dimethylaminoazobenzene and azodye-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Anti-genotoxic effect of different dynamized medicines has also been reported: Arsenicum album was found to ameliorate arsenic-induced toxicity in mice as well as in clinical studies and could reduce the elevated antinuclear antibody titer and hematological toxicities. Homeopathic therapy for asymptomatic HIV carriers has also proven beneficial and recently Rajendran reported homeopathy as a supportive therapy in cancer. Pathak et al. investigated Ruta 6 on regression of human glioma brain cancer cell growth clinically and found that Ruta induces severe telomere erosion in MGRI brain cancer cells but has no effect on B-lymphoid cells and normal lymphocytes. Banerji and Banerji reported that Ruta was effective for intracranial cysticercosis. Very few investigations have explored the action of dynamized medicine in in vitro cell culture systems. Podophyllum has been shown to inhibit adhesion of neutrophils to serum-coated micro plates. Traumeen S, a homeopathic formulation used clinically to relieve trauma and inflammation has been shown to inhibit the production of Interleukin-, TNF- and Interleukin-8 by human T cells and monocytes in culture. Many homeopathic drugs at low potencies were found to potentiate oxidative metabolism in cultured cells. We tried to evaluate the activity of selected homeopathic medicines in vitro for their cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing activity by cell culture methods. Since the medications are not being used on animals we have used the term dynamized instead of homeopathic medicines (We are indebted to a referee for this suggestion). We have also compared the effect of dynamized medicines with that of mother tinctures.
