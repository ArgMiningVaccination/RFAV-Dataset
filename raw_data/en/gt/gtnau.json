To print your [ immunization history](/pharmacy/services/my-pharmacy/immunization-history), login to your Rite Aid pharmacy account on RiteAid.com or ask your pharmacist to print out a copy for you. You can also view any immunizations you've received at Rite Aid within the Rite Aid app under your prescription history. No pharmacy account? You'll need your Rx number from your COVID-19 vaccination. After your vaccination you received a physical card, known as a Vaccination Record (VAR). This card will verify that you have received your COVID-19 vaccination, but it's important to keep it in a safe, secure location. Digital proof of vaccination is a verified record from your vaccine provider (in this case Rite Aid) that can be downloaded to your phone or other device and act as a backup and a more accessible version of your VAR that you can take on the go. There are still options to get your digital proof: If you received any dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at Rite Aid, then you are eligible to have your verified information added to your CLEAR account. If you only received one dose of a 2-dose vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) at Rite Aid, you'll be invited to add your single dose information into the CLEAR app. Then, you can add your additional dose information from another provider when linking your vaccination information . As long as CLEAR supports both providers and they're listed in the app, you will be able to link with both providers. If CLEAR does not support both providers, you will need to upload an image of your VAR. If you still need to get your 2nd dose, [schedule an appointment](/pharmacy/scheduler) or walk in to any Rite Aid today. If you were vaccinated at Rite Aid (for any dose) but have not received an email or SMS text message with your unique link, you can request it [here](https://riteaid.com/pharmacy/accessdigitalproof). Customers who received their COVID-19 doses at two different Rite Aid stores, will receive a separate unique link from each store to generate two separate SMART QR codes.
