He acted like he was looking at flies and attempting to bite them, but there was nothing there. The episodes increased over time. His owners took him to a veterinarian who recommended consultation with a neurologist who suggested putting Joey on lifelong anti-seizure medications, which have negative side-effects, including weight gain, lethargy and impaired liver function. Joey's owners wanted to find other options so he could remain active and social. When I met with his owners, I suggested a different approach based on my experience with integrative medicine. I treat the condition using a therapy called Veterinary NAET, which stands for Nambudripad's allergy elimination technique. Over 20 years ago, I began studies in NAET as an extension of acupuncture therapy in attempts to look for options for my pet patients suffering from extreme allergy problems. The pets who couldn't take prednisone and atopica, whose trial diets and allergy injections had failed, needed another option to find comfort. I was amazed when the first dog I treated became allergy and drug free after just six treatments. After decades of treating many allergic syndromes in pets, I kept finding that other disorders -- medical conditions like heart disease, chronic pancreatitis and kidney stones, autoimmune diseases and even cancer -- would spontaneously improve or be cured through NAET. It is the best treatment I've found to improve health and immune function in patients whose bodies are working against them. When pet owners see results in their companions, they often look for human practitioners to treat themselves and their families. Among my human clients who have sought treatment for themselves (I don't treat humans), I have heard of great results with food allergies, skin conditions, autoimmune disorders and even fertility issues. In Joey's case, I chose to treat him with NAET. Because his disorder showed up after adulthood, he is a highly sensitive pet (both physically and emotionally), and his episodes appeared to be a result of altered neurotransmitter and chemical pathways involving the nervous system. After just a few treatments, his episodes markedly decreased. Joey is now 5. He goes to doggie day care and plays with his friends. He has stopped his episodes and is not on seizure drugs. He visits the practice about three to four times annually for \"tune-ups\". These NAET treatments help him maintain a balanced immune system. Joey's case is not that unique among my patients. Though NAET doesn't work for 100 percent of the pets I treat with allergies, the success rate is much higher than treatment with drugs and allergy desensitization injections. Another successful NAET case came about when I treated Maddie, a 5-year-old Jack Russell terrier. She had a severe anaphylactic reaction to a rabies vaccine at another clinic. When her owners moved to our area, they requested that I pre-treat her with steroids, antihistamines and then vaccinate her. I do not like this protocol because the negative effects of the immunizations last a long time, possibly the pet's entire life, after the steroid effects are gone. Vaccines in allergic patients serve to increase immune sensitivity toward foods and other substances. In Maddie's case, I recommended NAET. I performed desensitization for the rabies vaccine. Though I suggested ceasing rabies shots, her owners insisted I vaccinate her again the following week. Maddie was given the vaccine without any pre-treatment of steroids. She had no ill effects and no anaphylactic reaction. Her allergy to the vaccine was cured. Hunter, another allergic dog patient from Pittsburgh, visited a 24-hour emergency clinic after being stung by a bee. He immediately swelled up and collapsed. The golden retriever was given emergency care to save his life. Hunter's owners sought NAET care, because they didn't want him to die if he was stung again, and Hunter loved chasing bugs. I treated him six times for allergies, including his reaction to bee stings. Hunter has eaten bees since then with no allergic reactions. If your pet suffers from any chronic health conditions, drug or food allergies, or autoimmune conditions, consider NAET as an option for improved health. Though not a cure for every problem, it has many applications, is non-invasive and may help extend your pet's life while improving his health.
