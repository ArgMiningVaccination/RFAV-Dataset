In addition, Rush includes Rush University, home to one of the first medical colleges in the Midwest and one of the nation's top-ranked nursing colleges, as well as programs in health sciences and biomedical research. The mission of Rush is to improve the health of the individuals and diverse communities we serve through the integration of outstanding patient care, education, research and community partnerships. Rush has received numerous accolades for its patient care, including the following honors: Five stars , the most possible, in the latest hospital ratings by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Ranked first for quality and safety among the country's leading academic medical centers in 2019 by the health care services company Vizient. Rush received 15 'A' grades for safety , the highest possible, from the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit hospital watchdog organization. For the second year in a row, Rush University Medical Center has been included in U.S. News & World Report 's Best Hospitals Honor Roll ranking 19th out of more than 3,000 hospitals nationwide.

We have adopted the following precautions to minimize your risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus, utilizing the expertise that has made Rush one of 35 medical centers in the United States designated by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as having the highest standards in infection control in the country. Requiring the COVID-19 vaccine for our staff: All Rush personnel is required to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This helps us ensure that we can protect the health and safety of our staff and safeguard members of our community who are at the highest risk of developing serious disease from the coronavirus. Temperature screening: All patients, staff and anyone else coming into any of our Rush locations have their temperature taken by contactless, infrared temperature scanners at our entrances, overhead or like the one shown in the photo above. Universal face masking: We give a hospital-grade mask to everyone who enters any of our facilities, and all Rush personnel wears masks while at the Medical Center. Masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, so this precaution provides an added level of protection for every person in our hospitals and clinics. To improve communication, clear masks are available upon request. Social distancing: We have reconfigured all waiting rooms and common areas to ensure that seating is at least six feet apart, and everyone is practicing social distancing whenever possible. Enhanced COVID-19 screening: We are screening all patients for COVID-19 symptoms when they come in for their appointments or procedures. Also, our call center has nurses on staff who screen patients over the phone at the time of scheduling and the night before an appointment/ procedure. Rush staff members ask several questions about possible COVID-19 symptoms and will guide patients on next steps if symptoms exist. Cellphone parking lot: Rush is providing a safe nearby, free parking area for loved ones to comfortably stay in their cars while waiting for patients who are having appointments, tests or procedures. Expanded COVID-19 testing: We are offering point-of-care COVID-19 testing, and we are testing unvaccinated surgical patients for COVID-19 before surgery. Also, if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or if you have a temperature of 100\u00b0F or higher, we are offering testing for patients in our designated COVID-19 clinic. Bringing care to you: In many of our clinics, we are able to bring some diagnostic testing, such as blood draws and other tests, directly to your exam room rather than having you visit several different labs and locations while you're here. This service allows you to limit the amount of time you spend at our locations and have fewer interactions. Meticulous cleaning: We are following stringent cleaning and disinfecting procedures in all locations, working closely with our infection control team and following federal and local guidelines. Isolation of COVID-19 patients: We have reconfigured our hospital to isolate patients with COVID-19 in our emergency department, inpatient units and clinics to avoid contact with other patients.Safety at Rush During COVID-19 3About Your Stay 4Your Room Your room is designed for the comfort of you and your family, guests and other visitors. If you have any questions about your room, please ask your nurse. Telephone A bedside telephone is provided in most rooms. When calling a department or office within the Medical Center, you only need to dial the last five digits of the number. For example, to reach someone at 942-5000, dial 2-5000. To make calls to numbers outside the Medical Center, dial 9 + 1 + the area code + the seven-digit number you are calling. Auxiliary aids are available free of charge to patients or their companions who are hard of hearing. If you need assistance, please ask a nurse. Your Meals Good nutrition plays an important role in recovery from surgery or illness and staying well afterward. A professional culinary team directed by our executive chef has developed a restaurant-style menu based on nutritional guidelines and patient feedback. Your meals are prepared fresh daily and will be customized to meet your personal preferences, to accommodate any food allergies, and to follow the diet your provider orders for you. Your nurse will provide you with a menu based on your diet. To place your order, call 2-3663 (FOOD). When you call, please let us know of any food allergies you have. Special menus to meet ethnic, religious or special health needs also are available on request. Snacks are available between meals on request. You can order meals up to two days in advance. Your family also can call from outside the hospital to place orders for you. To place an order from outside the hospital, call (312) 942-FOOD (3663). If our food and nutrition services staff members can do anything to make your meal experience more pleasant, please let them know while they are in your room. They also can help you determine the best diet to follow once you leave the hospital. If you are interested in nutrition counseling, you can let our team know when you place your meal orders, or ask your nurse to order you a nutrition consultation. Television A complete listing of the free television channels available in your room is included on the inside of the back cover of this booklet. Some of these channels include educational videos for you to learn more about your care. Ask your nurse if you are interested in watching the educational videos. All televisions are equipped with closed captioning. If you have any problems or issues with your television, please contact a member of our staff. The Wellness Channel provides 24-hour television programming to help you relax and to support a healing environment. This service is available on channel 63. Internet Wireless internet access is available throughout the Rush campus using the account RushPub. No login is required. 5Visitors Due to COVID-19, our visitor policy has been changing in recent months based on the number of cases in our area. Please check the Medical Center's website (rush.edu/visitor-updates), or talk with your caregiver for information about the current visitor policy, which will limit the number of visitors you can have. We understand that limiting visitors may be a hardship for both patients and families. While imposing visitor restrictions was a difficult decision, they are critically important to protect you and the other patients who have entrusted Rush with their care. We know the importance of loved ones being a part of the healing process. We encourage inpatients to connect with family and friends by phone and through other technology, such as FaceTime, Skype or Zoom. Visitors are permitted to bring food, flowers, or other personal items with them to the patient's room. However, our reception desks cannot accept or deliver outside food or personal items for inpatients at this time. Flower deliveries are accepted on weekdays until 4:30 p.m. Visitor Policy and Procedures When they arrive at Rush to visit a patient in the Tower, Atrium Building or Kellogg Building, visitors must check in at the information desk at either the fourth floor of the Atrium or the Edward A. Brennan Entry Pavilion on the first floor of the Tower. Bring a picture ID. When they arrive, visitors will be asked to show a government-issued photo ID , such as a driver's license, state ID, U.S. military credentials, permanent resident card, readable international passport, or matricula consular ID. Get their photo taken. Our information desk staff will scan the visitor's ID and will take a photo of any other visitors in their party who are 12 years or older. Receive their visitor's badge. Each visitor will receive a badge, which will include their first and last name, photo and destination, and the badge issue date. The badge will expire in 24 hours. After the badge expires, visitors may return to the information desk to get a new badge. The badge must be worn so it is easy to see . If it is not visible, any member of the Rush staff may ask a visitor to show it to them. Check out. When they are leaving Rush, visitors must stop by a security post to check out of the hospital and return their badge. It's important that visitors return their badges to avoid delays at their next visit. Anyone going to Kellogg, Atrium or Tower to visit a patient staying in the hospital, accompany a patient going to a procedure, or attend an outpatient appointment will need to register and receive a visitor's badge.

If you have any questions about your care team, please feel free to discuss them with your nurse. Getting Your Questions Answered Our staff is available to address and resolve any questions you may have while you are here. The following staff members may be contacted during your stay: A staff member on your patient care unit, such as your physician or nurse The Patient Relations Department, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., at (312) 942-6979 The hospital operations administrator, who can be reached by dialing 0 and asking the operator to page the administrator to your room phone number Your Comfort, Safety and Security Understanding and Treating Pain At Rush, your doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals care about your comfort and well-being and want your experience to be as pain-free as possible. Not every patient will experience pain, but those who do can feel better with treatment. Only you know how much pain you feel. Please talk openly with your doctors and nurses about your pain \u2014 you and your health care team will work together to develop a plan to manage your pain. Your pain can be measured. You will be asked to rate your pain using a scale like the one at right. About Your Stay9Here are some helpful things to know about pain medicine and pain: You should not wait until the pain becomes too severe to take your medicine. Pain is much easier to control when it is mild than when it is severe. Telling your nurse or doctor about your pain does not make you a bad patient. There are nonmedicinal treatments that can help relieve pain. They include using hot or cold compresses, listening to music, watching television and using relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. Medications The medications you take during your hospital stay are prescribed by your physician and dispensed by the hospital pharmacy. For your own protection during your hospitalization, do not take any medications that have not been ordered by your physician or arranged through your nurse. If you brought your own medications, tell your nurse about them. It is extremely important that your doctor and nurse know exactly what medications you are taking while in the hospital. If you have any questions or concerns about your medications, discuss them with your physician, nurse or pharmacist. v 2.010Medication Safety Medication safety means you get the right medicine, in the right dose, at the right times. You can help ensure that you get the right medicines the right way by doing the following: 1. Tell your health care team all the medicines, supplements and herbs that you are taking. Tell your health care team about any allergies or side effects you have had to any medicines in the past. 2. Ask what each medicine is for and what side effects to watch for. If you think you are experiencing side effects, tell your nurse immediately. 3. Know the names of your medications and what times you should get them in the hospital. 4. Speak up if you think you are getting the wrong medicine or are having any side effects. 5. Have your health care team go over each medication with you and a family member before you're ready to go home. Update your medication list from home if any prescriptions change or if new medications are added. Carry this list with you at all times. Immunization Registry Rush participates in the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (I-CARE). It is a web-based immunization tool developed by the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). I-CARE is designed to help health care providers record, track and report their patients' immunizations and share the immunization records of Illinois residents with other providers statewide. Protecting the privacy of patients and the security of the data contained in the I-CARE registry is a high priority for IDPH. Your immunization data will be transmitted electronically to the I-CARE registry whenever you are given an immunization at Rush. Patient participation is voluntary. Should you choose not to participate in the I-CARE registry, you may opt out by signing the \"opt out\" registry form during your stay. You may obtain the \"opt out\" registry form by requesting it from your health care provider. Valuables/Personal Property Please keep only necessary personal items, such as a robe, slippers, toiletries and assistive devices (your walker, cane or crutches) with you during your stay. When not in use, items such as eyeglasses, dentures and hearing aids should be stored in the proper containers. If you need a container, ask a staff member. Let a staff member know if you have any valuables to store in the hospital safe. For your own protection, please be cautious about keeping any valuable personal property in your room that is not secured. The visitor parking garage is a public parking facility. When parking in this garage or on the street, please do not leave valuables such as laptops, bags and GPS devices visible in the car. The hospital will not assume responsibility for loss of valuables or personal property.About Your Stay11Your Role in Safety and Security At Rush, the entire health care team is committed to providing the highest quality care in the safest surroundings possible. You are the center of the health care team, and we ask that you help us by taking an active role in your care. We encourage you to speak up, ask questions and discuss any concerns about your care, the health care team or safety issues with your doctor or nurse. Reporting Safety Concerns If you have safety concerns, we encourage you to speak with your nurse or doctor about them. If the issue is not resolved to your satisfaction, please call the Rush Patient Relations Department to speak with a Rush patient representative at (312) 942-6979 (during business hours), or dial 0 on the phone in your room and ask for the hospital operations administrator. The Rush leadership team also is involved directly with patient concerns. If you still are not satisfied after first contacting the aforementioned personnel, please dial 0 and ask for the executive on call. Identification Everyone who works at Rush must wear name badges with photo identification while in the Medical Center. Don't hesitate to ask to see the ID badge of anyone who approaches you without one. Your hospital wristband serves as an important part of your identification while you are in the hospital. You will be asked two questions \u2014 your name and date of birth \u2014 to ensure your proper identification. You will find this identification is checked many times while you are in the hospital. The band contains important information about you that helps us meet your individual needs. Please wear the band throughout your stay. If your band is removed, falls off or becomes uncomfortable, let your nurse know immediately. Preventing Infections At Rush we strive to provide the very best patient care to assure the very best outcomes. Preventing infections is one of the most important goals at Rush. While not every infection is preventable, many can be prevented by taking certain steps. Partner with us to prevent infections. Clean Your Hands: The single most important thing you can do to prevent infections is to clean your hands. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Clean your hands often and remind others to clean theirs, too. Know About Health Care Associated Infections and Precautions: Health care associated infections can develop during, or soon after, receiving treatment for a medical or surgical condition. They include the following types of infections: - Surgical site infections - Catheter associated urinary tract infections - Central line associated blood stream infections Isolation: In some cases, isolation is required to reduce the risk of spreading an infection. A sign will be posted on your room door. Hospital staff and visitors who enter may be required to wear a gown, gloves, mask and eye covering. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about isolation precautions. Talk with your health care team if you have any questions about preventing infection.12Keeping Patients Safe: Preventing Falls in the Hospital In the hospital, patients are at higher risk for falling. You may not realize that you are at risk for falling, but it can happen to anyone. We need your help to prevent falls. You can help prevent falls by taking the following precautions: Let your nurse know if you: - have fallen before. - use a cane or walker at home. - have a difficult time getting out of bed, off of the toilet, or up from a chair. - feel dizzy or weak. Call for assistance before getting out of bed or a chair, even when family or visitors are present. Always wear nonslip footwear. Non-skid slipper socks can be provided to you. If you use an assistive device, such as a cane or walker at home, use it while you are in the hospital. Wear your glasses, contact lenses and/or hearing aids while in the hospital. Help us keep things you need within your reach. If anything is out of your reach, please call for assistance. Follow staff instructions to prevent falls. Remember: Call, don't fall! Preventing Blood Clots Anyone can develop a blood clot (also known as deep vein thrombosis). A decrease in activity can increase your risk. To prevent blood clots, your doctor may order medicines and/or a compression device. Ask your health care team about leg exercises that you can perform while you are in bed and other steps you can take to prevent a blood clot. Preventing Bed Sores Bedsores (also called pressure injuries) are easier to prevent than to treat. They are caused by pressure from staying in one position for too long. You can help avoid pressure injuries by frequently changing position when you are in bed or in a chair. If you suspect that you have a pressure injury, tell your doctor or nurse right away. Smoking For the health of our entire community, the Medical Center is a tobacco-free campus. Smoking is not allowed anywhere on the Rush campus, including all outdoor areas. If you would like help to quit smoking, please contact the following resources: The Illinois Tobacco Quitline at (866) QUIT-YES (784-8937), www.quityes.org For a primary care physician at Rush who can help, call Rush Physician Referral at (888) 352-RUSH (7874).About Your StayGoing Home The discharge time is typically 11 a.m., although you may leave earlier or later depending on your circumstances.

The agency staff will call you to establish a time for the first visit. Financial Arrangements Your hospital bill reflects charges for the care you received, as well as daily room charges, room linens, housekeeping and some support services. Your bill also includes special charges for laboratory tests, X-rays, special therapies, blood processing, medications and other services ordered by your physician. You may receive a separate bill for professional services, such as those provided by anesthesiologists and consultants. Your health care insurance is a contract between you and your insurance company. You are responsible for paying any portion of your hospital bill not covered by insurance. You are responsible for knowing your insurance company's network providers.

Patient Responsibilities Communication Patients are responsible to provide information about past illnesses, hospitalizations, medications and other matters related to health status. To participate effectively in decision making, patients must be encouraged to take responsibility for requesting additional information or clarification about their health status or treatment when they do not fully understand information and instructions. Rush expects our patients to: Communicate openly and honestly with your care providers. Provide information about past illnesses, hospitalizations, medications and other health-related matters. Notify your health care provider of any pain you are experiencing, and work with the staff to achieve effective pain management. If you do not fully understand instructions or information about your condition or treatment, ask your health care provider questions to make sure you know the facts and details about your plan of care. Patients are also responsible to ensure that the health care institution has a copy of their written advance directive if they have one. Advance directives are written instructions that convey to your doctors and your family what kinds of treatments you want in case you become unable to make medical decisions for yourself. Advance directives include: Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care - a document that appoints someone to make health care decisions on your behalf if you are unable to express your wishes. A Living Will - a document that allows you to describe your wishes about the discontinuance of death-delaying procedures if you become terminally ill and are unable to express your wishes. For more information, contact your physician, or the Department of Religion, Health and Human Values at (312) 942-5571. Patients are responsible for informing their physicians and other caregivers if they anticipate problems in following prescribed treatment. Awareness Patients should also be aware of the hospital's obligation to be reasonably efficient and equitable in providing care to other patients and the community. The hospital's rules and regulations are designed to help the hospital meet this obligation. Patients and their families are responsible for making reasonable accommodations to the needs of the hospital, other patients, medical staff and hospital employees. Patients are responsible for providing necessary information for insurance claims and for working with the hospital to make payment arrangements. A person's health depends on much more than health care service. Patients are responsible for recognizing the impact of their lifestyle on their personal health. Collaboration At Rush, we take a collaborative approach to your care by partnering with you and your family. As an active participant in your care, you have certain responsibilities that will help in the effectiveness of your care and your satisfaction with your care. Rush asks you to:21 Provide necessary information for insurance claims and work with the hospital to make payment arrangements when necessary. Refrain from aggressive behavior \u2014 verbal or physical. Rush is a safe and healing place, and this behavior is not tolerated. Physical assault will be reported to law enforcement. For security assistance at Rush University Medical Center, call (312) 942-5678. Respect the rights and property of other patients, visitors and staff.

Rush expects our patients and visitors to adhere to our values in their interaction with our staff and each other.

Patient Rights A patient has the right to the following: Participate in the development and implementation of your plan of care. Receive important information about your care and visitation rights in a preferred language. Care free from discrimination (based on age, race, ethnicity, ancestry, marital or parental status, veteran's status, religion, culture, language, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity/expression, socioeconomic status or any other category protected by federal or state law or county or city ordinance). This also applies to any person who may have the legal responsibility to make decisions regarding medical care on the patient's behalf. Receive care and treatment that respects your cultural and personal values, beliefs and preferences to the extent permitted by law and hospital policy. Review or obtain copies of your medical record within a reasonable timeframe.

Be free from all forms of abuse and harassment, including neglect, retaliation and humiliation. Be free from any form of restraints that are not medically necessary, and be free from seclusion and restraints that are used as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience or retaliation. Seclusion or a restraint can only be used when needed to ensure a patient's physical safety or improve a patient's well-being and when less restrictive alternatives have been determined to be ineffective. Have a family member, friend or another individual be present with you for emotional support during the course of the hospital stay, as long as the individual's presence does not infringe on others' rights, safety, or does not endanger the health or safety of the patient. The patient also has the right to withdraw or deny such consent at any time. - Rush University System for Health will not restrict, limit or otherwise deny visitation privileges on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. - Rush University System for Health shall ensure that all visitors designated by the patient enjoy visitation privileges that are not more restrictive than those that immediate family members enjoy.

Privacy rights established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). These rights are outlined in the Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP), which is provided to each new patient at Rush. File a complaint or grievance with Rush University System for Health. This may be done orally or in writing. The goal of Rush is to provide health care that is supportive and patients are assured that the presentation of a complaint or concern will not compromise treatment. 2223Rush University System for Health has the burden of proof to demonstrate that a visitation restriction is necessary to provide safe care. When visitation would interfere with the care of the patient and/or the care of other patients, it would be considered clinically appropriate to place a visitation restriction \u2014 for example, if the patient is undergoing care interventions, or there are infection control issues. Other situations where restrictions are appropriate include disruptive, threatening or violent behavior by a visitor; the patient's need for rest or privacy; existing court orders restricting contact of which Rush is aware; limitations on the number of visitors during a specific period of time; and minimum age requirements for child visitors. If patients, for whatever reason, are unable to understand their patient rights, health care providers will provide whatever assistance is reasonably necessary to assist the patients in understanding their rights. This may include (but is not limited to) the use of assistive devices for the hearing and seeing impaired or the use of interpreters for those who are not proficient in English. Patient Complaints Rush's goal is to provide supportive health care. We want to know if you are not satisfied with your care or if you feel like you have been denied any of your patient rights. You can be assured that any complaint or concern will not compromise your treatment. Complaints Concerning Denial of Patient Rights If you are a patient and feel you have been denied any of your patient rights, or have suffered harm or physical injury as a result of your care at any of our facilities, please contact the below departments: Patient Relations Department at (312) 942-6979 or patient_relations@rush.edu. Office of Risk Management at (312) 942-7828. The appropriate department will promptly investigate the complaint and respond or provide an update within 30 days. Depending on the nature of the complaint and the need to further investigate the facts, we may provide a written response to the patient's complaint. In the resolution of a grievance, the appropriate department will provide the patient with written notice of the decision, which will contain the name of the hospital contact person, the steps taken on behalf of the patient to investigate the grievance, the results of the grievance process and the date of completion.
