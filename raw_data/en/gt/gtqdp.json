It is estimated that there will be approximately 231,840 new breast cancer cases in 2015. A remarkable amount of biomedical research has been conducted for the past several decades, trillions of dollars have been spent, and some significant progress in breast cancer research and treatment has been made during this period. Despite this progress, several fundamental challenges and unresolved questions remain.

Enchanting Beauty: Ancient Secrets with Manisha Kshirsagar Master the art of \"Enchanting beauty\" by using ancient principles of Ayurveda and Yoga that are easily applicable for modern day living. True beauty is the reflection of your self-perception, spiritual connection, physical health and emotional well-being. Inner beauty refers to your self worth, value and acceptance. Your respective level of self-love then manifests outwardly in the form of virtuous behaviors. Someone with strong inner beauty has natural qualities of compassion, generosity and helpfulness. When we honor ourselves from within, the effect shows up in our external appearance or our physiological health which we call Outer beauty. Once both inner and outer beauty is consistently maintained throughout your lifetime, you become a living example of lasting beauty. Lasting beauty is an anti-aging, health promoting lifestyle that upholds beauty in all regards of a woman's life. These three \"levels\" of beauty are the cornerstones for creating enchanting beauty - a beauty that exudes femininity, grace, self-confidence, virtuous character and radiant health.
