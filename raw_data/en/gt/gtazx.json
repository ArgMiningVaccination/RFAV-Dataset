No responsibility is assured or implied for errors or omissions created by technical difficulties. No one shall be entitled to claim detrimental reliance thereon.

Q: What is a naturopathic medical doctor? A: Naturopathic medical doctors (NMDs) are educated and trained in accredited naturopathic medical colleges. They diagnose, prevent, and treat acute and chronic illness to restore and establish optimal health by supporting the patient's inherent self-healing process. NMDs work to identify underlying causes of illness and develop personalized treatment plans to address them. Q: When were naturopathic medical doctors able to be licensed in Idaho? A: July 1, 2020, NMDs were able to complete online applications for licensing by the Idaho Board of Medicine. Q: Are visits to a naturopathic medical doctor be covered by insurance? A: The law does not mandate insurance coverage for NMDs. However, licensing is the first step for an insurance company to consider coverage for the services of a provider. Q: How can I check to see if my provider is licensed? A: If you want to check to see if a provider is licensed, you can search for them on the BOM license search and verification request web page. Q: What is the difference between a traditional naturopathic doctor (ND) and a licensed naturopathic physician/naturopathic medical doctor (NMD)? A: There is a title distinction between licensed naturopathic doctors with other naturopathic providers. Not all states use the same titles. Twenty-three states have licensing or registration laws for naturopathic medical doctors with laws differing from state to state. In neighboring states, it is more common to see the ND and naturopath designations. Q: What can a naturopathic medical doctor do? A: Naturopathic medical doctors in Idaho may: - Perform physical examinations, and order laboratory tests, imaging, and other diagnostic tests consistent with naturopathic medical education and training. - Dispense, administer, and prescribe prescription drugs and medical devices as authorized by the naturopathic medical formulary as set forth in rule. - Perform minor office procedures. - Perform therapies for which they are trained and educated, consistent with primary care and provisions of the law. - Admit patients to a hospital at which they are credentialed and privileged to do so. - The practice of naturopathic medicine does not include the practice of obstetrics. Q: What are the requirements to obtain a naturopathic medical doctor license in Idaho? A: To obtain naturopathic medical doctor licensure in Idaho applicants must: - Graduate from an accredited naturopathic medical program. - Pass the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX) administered and approved by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners. - Complete a fingerprint-based criminal history check of the Idaho central criminal database and the Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history database. - The board may require an interview for the applicant, limited to a review of the applicant's qualifications and professional credentials. Q: How do I check the status of my application? A: Visit [Online Applications (Login) (idaho.gov)](https://apps-dopl.idaho.gov/IBOMAppStat/UniversalPages/LoginPage.aspx) to check the status of application. Q: How do I request a duplicate license? A: The license/registration issued to you by the Board is public proof that you are entitled to pursue certain activities regulated by Idaho Law. If your license/registration becomes lost or destroyed, you may obtain a duplicate from the Board. If you did not receive your license/registration after making application for renewal, you must apply for a duplicate. A duplicate may also be requested if you have changed your name or address and wish to receive a license/registration bearing the updated information. Note: There is a fee, required by Idaho law, to obtain a duplicate. If you believe the fee should be waived, you may attach a written explanation of why you believe the fee should be waived, together with the application and the fee. You may complete the [Application for Duplicate License](https://apps-dopl.idaho.gov/IBOMPortal/IBOM/Forms/IBOM%20Duplicate%20License%20Request%20Form.pdf) (Link to form) form online, print it out and sign it (your signature must be notarized), and send it with the required fee of $10.00 to the Board of Medicine. Note, however, that your request will not be processed unless the fee is received with the application. A duplicate card will be mailed to the mailing address of record within 24 hours of your completed applications receipt in the Board office. Q: What are the requirements for continuing medical education (CME)?
