Although traditional medical procedur es are generally regarded as pre- ferred among allopathic doctors (MD), osteopathic doctors (DO), and others who hold degrees in allied health disciplines granted by W estern universities, comple- mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) consist of therapies outside this convention. Because there is such a variety of nontradi- tional medical practice and treatment, theNCAAM developed specific definitions for these remedies to distinguish them from traditional medicine. The NCCAM identi-fies complementary medicine as therapy used with conventional medical treatment, whereas alternative medicine is therapy used in place of conventional medicine. There are five categories of CAM: (1) alternative medical systems (homeopathic and naturo-pathic medicine); (2) mind-body interven- tions (meditation, prayer, dance, art and music therapies); (3) biologically based therapies (botanical remedies, foods, andvitamins); (4) manipulative and body-based methods (chiropractic or osteopathic ma- nipulation and massage); and (5) energytherapies ( chi gong, reiki, therapeutic touch, and therapies using electromagnetic fields) (see http://altmed.od.nih.gov/health/ whatiscam/).Predictors of College Students' Use of Complementary and Alternative the Department of Kinesiology, HealthPromot ion and Recreation at the University of North Texas, P.O.

A majority (66%, n=913) of students reported using complementary and alternative medicine, with higher use found among older students ( p=.006) and female students ( p=.01). Holistic attitude and control were strong predictors for college students use of complementary and alternative medicine, and there was a significant correlation between internal locus of control and the use of complementary and alternative medicine ( r=.35, p=.01). College students were more likely to use complementary and alternative medicine when compared with samples from other studies.Campus health care providers and college curriculum planners may need to include complementary and alterna- tive medicine services and education to help students maintain health and wellness.Chwee Lye Chng, Kweethai Neill, and Peggy Fogle 268 American Journal of Health Education \u2014 September/October 2003, Volume 34, No. 5The u se of CAM among consumers and patients (Del Mundo, Shepard, & Macrose, 2002; Eisenberg et Palinkas & Kabongo, 2000) rang es from 35% of the general population in Eisenberg's (1998) study to 21-50% of patients at family practice offices (Elder et al. 1997; Del Mundo et al. 2002; andPalinkas et al. 2000) using some form of CAM therapies. Almost half of the patientsin these studies did not discuss their CAMuse with their physicians. What motivates individuals to use CAM is yet to be established. Pettelier, Marie,Krasner, and Haskell (1997) identified eight different reasons for increased consumer use of CAM, including dissatisfaction with conventional medicine, perception that conventional medicine does not include their spiritual and mental well-being,greater awareness of medical practices of other cultures, and greater availability of information that link lifestyle, emotional, and nutritional factors to disease. But Astin(1998) found that dissatisfaction withconventional me dicine did not predict the use of CAM. Instead, the congruency ofbeliefs, values, and philosophical issueswere found to be more important issues for subjects in choosing to use CAM. Astin (1998) also found that educated personswere more likely to use CAM than were those with less education. College students are a unique popula- tion who are likely to use CAM. First, they have more education than their high school peers who did not go on to college. Second,they are in learning environments that present them with myriads of information while they are often faced with having tomake decisions of self-care for the first time, independent of their parents. Patterson and Graf (2000) presented a strong argument to integr ate CAM into the college-level health education curriculum to educate students about CAM and to help them bet- ter serve their clients when they become health professionals. This study proposed to determine (1) to what extent college students use CAM, (2)what attitudes college students have towardthe use of CAM, (3) the relationship be-tween students' health locus of control andtheir attitudes toward the use of alternative medicine, (4) the relationship between stu- dents' health locus of control and their use of CAM, and (5) what factors predict col-lege students' use of CAM. SIGNIFICANCE Understanding how much college stu- dents use CAM, how students feel toward CAM, and the predictors of college studentsuse of CAM will be helpful in planning stu- dent health services on campus to better serve students. Having this understandingalso helps establish the need for health ser- vices providers on campus to expand their knowledge of CAM to help avoid negative drug and CAM interactions, and also to educate their patients. Further, this knowl- edge could be used to provide an argumentfor offering courses on CAM to help stu- dents toward self-care. METHOD Sample and Procedures The sample was drawn from students at the University of North Texas (UNT), a campus with approximately 30,000 under-graduate a nd graduate students. Approval was obtained from the Institutional ReviewBoard of UNT and informed consent pro-tocol w as appropriately applied. Students enrolled in different classes across disciplines from summer through fallsemesters were asked to respond. They were instructed not to repeat the surveys if they had previously responded. A total of 940questionnaires were distributed. Measures The independen t variables were gender, class level, CAM use (CAMU), attitudes toward altern ative medicine (ATAM), and mult idimensional The dependent variables were CAMU, ATAM, and MHLC. Independent and dependent variables were employedappropriately according to analytical procedures in response to individual re- search question.A 51-item instrument was developed for the study. The items in the subscales were selected after test-retest reliability was es- tablished. The instrument consisted of (1) the ATAM scale (22 items); (2) MHLC scale(18 items); (3) CAMU scale (7 items); and (4) demographic data (4 items). The ATAM subscales were safety (10 items, alpha=0.88,test-retest reliability=0.82); holistic attitude and control (8 items, alpha=0.83, test- reliability=0.65); and (IHLC) [6 items, alpha=0.66, test-retest alpha=0.63, test-retest reliability=0.70]; and alpha=0.65, test-retest reliability=0.73]. Seven items of CAMU requiring yes/no responses, and four demographic questions were added to theATAM a nd MHLC to complete the 51- item instrument. CAMU measures to what extent college students used CAM in the past 12 months. Use included meditation/relaxation; mas- ATAM m easures attitudes toward CAMU along three dimensions: holistic attitude and control, dissatisfaction with modern/ western medicine, and safety. The MHLC(Wallston, Wallston IHLC is thebelief that the individual has the ability to influence his/her health. PHLC is the belief that one's health is determined by powerful others, such as doctors or health care pro-fessionals. CHLC measures the extent to which health or illness is a matter of fate,luck, or chance. The instrument also in- cluded demographic items asking for gen- der, age, class level, and ethnicity. All items except the de mographic items used a 5- point Likert-type response format. Data A nalysis Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data collected. The SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social SciencesChwee Lye Chng, Kweethai Neill, and Peggy Fogle American Journal of Health Education \u2014 September/October 2003, Volume 34, No. 5 269Version 10, 1999) was used for all necessary computations. Level of statistical signifi- cance was set at p<.05. RESULTS A total of 913 completed questionnaires were returned (97% response rate). The to- tal sample (N =913) consisted of under- graduates enrolled in core classes ( n=684), graduate students ( n=229), students using the Student Health and Wellness Center(n=48), students from the University Union (n=9), and members of student organiza- tions ( n=97). The sample adequately rep- resented the UNT student profiles (Table 1). The sample was 64% female, with no sig- nificant differences in age between genders.The r espondents ranged in age from 18-62 years ( M=24.73, SD=6.25). of College ( n=913) of sample col- lege students reported use of alternativemedicine during the past year. Of this sample, 43% (Table 2).A chi-square test that females were mo re likely ( 2=6.237; p=.01) to re- port CAMU than males (odds ratio [OR]=1.4). Female students were more likely to use massage (OR=1.52; p=.025). Graduate stu- dents were more likely to use CAM than undergraduates (OR=1.6; 2=7.67; p=.006). Graduate stud massage therapy es of College Students Toward CAMU Overall, students showed a slightly posi- tive attitude toward CAM ( M=3.13, SD=0.51 on a 5-point scale in which 5=strongly agree and 1= strongly disagree ), more specifically, slightly positive on holis- tic attitude and control ( M=3.45, SD=0.58),on safety ( SD=0.62), and slight medicine (M=2.45, SD=0.58). There was no statisti- cally significant difference on the ATAM overall su mmative mean scores between genders. Students did not report concern about safety issues ( M=4.01, SD=0.93) or credibility of practitioner s (M=3.68, SD=0.99) and believed that CAM profes- sionals and modern Western medicine pro- fessionals should work together (M =4.17, SD=0.90). Health Locus of Control and Attitudes Toward and CAMU A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between holistic atti- tude and control and IHLC ( r=.35, p=.01).Powerful ot hers health locus of control PHLC was found to have a statistically sig- nificant negative correlation with IHLC(r=-.142, p <.01).

Theses two factors ac- counted for 18% of the variance. Although the second outcome of a stepwise logistic regression model confirmed that having an IHLC was a significant predictor of al-ternative medicine use (Wald=15.91, p=.001), but it accounted for only 3% of variance. A multivariate analysis of variance con- firmed no gender differences among stu- dents on the MHLC. In reviewing differ- ences between undergraduate andgraduat es on the MHLC, controlling for age, a multivariate analysis of covariance alsofound no significant differences. DISCUSSION The study used self-reported data from student volunteers and therefore cannot begeneralized to all college students. Self-re- ported data also present possible social bi- ases. The sample was recruited from mul- tiple sources on campus to match UNT's student profile. Table 3 shows a comparison of this study with the reports from other studies. Stu- dents from this sample were more likely touse CAM than reported in other studies (66% reporting use in past year), 28% (Drivdahl & Miser, 1998), 42% (Eisenberget al. 1998), and 62% (Burg, Hatch, &Neims, 1998). When so many students engage in self- care and CAM on campus, often withoutinforming their physician at home or oncampus, there is a potential risk of possible hazardous drug/therapeutic interactions. It is important for clinic staff and campushealth educators to be aware of popular herbal and vitamin therapies so as to in- struct students on their proper use and theirlimitations. Information about vitamins and herbal medicines could also be included on the health center Web page. Consiste nt with previous studies (Astin, 1998; Eisenberg et al. 1998), females weremore likely to use CAM. Also, no differenceson rate of use among ethnic groups were found (Astin, 1998). In this sample, for ev- ery 100 graduate students reporting CAMU,60 undergraduate students reported CAMU, which is consistent with Astin (1998) and Eisenberg et al. (1998), who sug-gested that age and education may be im- portant factors in the decision to engage in practices of CAM. Astin (1998) indicated that the more education a person had, themore likely the person was knowledgeableabout CAM. This was often through their own re ading and study. Students reported a positive attitude toward CAM. Having a holistic attitude and control was a primary predictor for CAMU. This was not surprising, becausepersons who use alternative medicine alsosubscribe to concepts of holistic health andpersonal control, which is consistent withAstin (1998). A desire to play an active role as a part- ner in health care decisions was found tobe a predictor for CAMU. Although this sample reported that CAM provided them with this option, they saw no conflict with collabor ation between the providers of modern Western medicine and CAM.Students who reported using CAM wereneither dissatisfied with modern Western medicine, nor concerned about the safety of alternative medicines. Astin (1998) alsofound that neither negative attitudes nor experiences with modern Western medicine were predictors for the use of al-ternativ e medicine. Benjamen Berman, Jacobs, and Starr (1997) reported a wide range of opinionsabout the safety of CAM, ranging from safe and profoundly beneficial to unscrupulous quackery. The sample was not concernedabout the safety of alternative medicine. In fact, students responded most negatively to qu estions that suggested that CAM of- fered quick cures that were potentiallyharmful, and that CAM practitioners werequacks and frauds. The students appeared to have high regard for CAM practitioners and their services and did not feel threat-ened or in jeopardy when using such ser- vices. These findings are important for col- lege health care providers, who must incorporate questions about CAM use as Table 3.

Respondents in this study indicated that a holistic attitudeand control are important factors in their decision to use CAM. Medical providers should acknowledge that students recognizethe importance of the mind and body in promoting wellness and wish to be treated holistically. Because control is also identi-fied as an important factor, medical provid- ers should ascertain that the care options discussed promote shared decision-making. Consistent with Wallston and colleagues (1978) and Sweeting (1990), this study found that IHLC was a predictor for CAMuse. As persons who use CAM are more likely to respond positively to programs and services that promote self-direction andcontrol, in addition to care, it may be help- ful for service providers and educators toprovide reading materials and other self-study resources for students. CONCLUSIONS The practice of CAM among Southwest- ern college students in this study was wide-spread compared with other studies. Theuse of vitamin supplements, herbal medi-cine, relaxation/meditation, and massage therapy were found to be the most popular CAM techniques used among students.A holistic attitude and control toward CAM was a set of strong predictors for col- lege students' CAMU. There possess- ing an IHLC. This stud y confirmed that the practice of CAM was widespread among college stu- dents. As they attend to the health care needs of students, health providers could also educate students about the health po-tential and risks of different aspects of CAM. Campus health care professionalsshould provide updated information andguidelines to help students make informed health choices. This service may include asking students when they seek medicalattention at the health center whether they use CAM. College health care professionals should find out more about CAM them-selves so that they can provide credible information and appropriate advice tostudents. Sikund and Laken (1998) reported most of the physicians (83.5%) in theirstudy believed their patients were using CAM, and 54% of these doctors were inter- ested in taking courses in CAM. Consistentwith Eisenberg's (2002) suggestion, physi- cians should incorporate effective CAMinto patient care, allow time to explain treat-ment choices to patients, and respect pa- tient choices among therapeutic alternatives. Because females and older students are more amenable to using CAM, health edu-cators should work closely with other cam- pus resources to provide education and ad-vice to fema le students. They may use resources on campus to reach nontradi- tional and commuting female students. Incorporating relaxation techniques, massage therapy, or yoga classes in college health centers, counseling centers, andpsychology clinics would be appropriate and timely. Campus health professionals may consider incorporating CAM insome of their therapies. Campuses may con- sider offering courses on CAM as part of a core curricul um to all students as a mea- sure to improve their knowledge on per-sonal health. CAMU is on the rise on campuses (Denur, 1997). Students may not be awareof potential risks of mixing CAM remedies and conventional medicine. It would be helpful for college health providers to con-duct periodic survey s of students regard- ing their CAMU so as to be more effectivein treating students when they appear fortreatment at college health facilities.
