Reduce free radical damage Schisandra is also extra-impressive because of its anti-inflammatory benefits. Schisandra berries are incredibly rich in antioxidants, which combat free radical damage in cells and lower generalized inflammation levels in the body.

Free radical damage is at the root of many chronic diseases like arthritis, depression, and cancer, but it's also responsible for signs of premature aging. Because of this, Schisandra berry has traditionally been prescribed as a part of beauty regimens, too. Because of its impressive free radical-fighting and anti-inflammatory prowess, schisandra berries can help improve and memory.

Like with any supplement, you should consult with your medical provider before taking schisandra. It has a number of potential side effects and interactions, including: The effects of schisandra berries have not been researched on pregnant women, and should not be consumed by anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding. People who have GERD or who have stomach ulcers should be careful not to exceed the recommended dosage of the berries, as they can exacerbate these conditions as well. Because schisandra berries are metabolized in the liver, they may interact with some medications. This interaction could cause the concentration of the medication to increase (increasing the risk of side effects) or to drop (decreasing the effectiveness of the drug). Always make sure you've consulted your doctor before starting a new supplement like schisandra.
