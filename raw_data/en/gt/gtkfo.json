What are the potential complications of in/f_l uenza for adults 65 +? Direct E ects: Multi-Organ Systems Exacerbation of: FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose is not indicated for reduction of potential complications of infl uenza such as asthma, COPD, ear/sinus infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal disorders or diabetes.Why are adults 65 + more vulnerable to in/f_l uenza? Immunosenescence Infl uenza infection in adults 65 years of age and older is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heightened susceptibility to infl uenza-related complications in older adults is due in large part to the natural and progressive weakening of the immune system over time\u2014a phenomenon known as immunosenescence. Immunosenescence also renders seniors less responsive to standard- dose infl uenza vaccine.1 Reduced vaccine e ectiveness In the elderly, vaccine e ectiveness is ~50% less than in healthy adults, and varies depending on the outcome measures and the study population.5 A study showed that for the infl uenza seasons 1998-1999 through to 2004-2005, the e ectiveness was:1 62% to 76% in persons 15-64 years of age 26% to 52% in persons 65 years of age E ectiveness of standard-dose infl uenza vaccine1, 21 How effective in a multicentre clinical trial? FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose vaccine was demonstrated to provide superior e cacy for the 65 + population against laboratory-con rmed illness caused by any virus type or subtype in adults 65 years of age and older (95% uenza caused by strains similar endpoint; 95% CI:12.5 to 52.5).2 *Comparative clinical signi/f_i cance has Agency of Canada, 2013-2018. Standard-dose trivalent in/f_l uenza contains 60 g of hemagglutinin (HA), which is four times as much HA as in FLUZONE\u00ae, a standard-dose infl uenza vaccine with High-Dose indicated for? FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose is indicated for active immunization against infl uenza caused by the speci c strains of infl uenza virus contained in the vaccine in adults 65 years of age and older. Annual fl u vaccination using the most current vaccine is recommended as immunity declines in the year following vaccination.1 What are the risks of in/f_l uenza for adults 65+? Adults 65 years of age and older are particularly vulnerable to influenza1,3, and suffer disproportionately from infl uenza-related morbidity and mortality.4,5 Hospitalizations and deaths While Canadian adults age 65+ represented approximately 15% of the Canadian population, they accounted for up to:6 -12 70% of infl uenza-related hospitalizations 91% of deaths Chronic conditions and mortality Higher infl uenza-attributed mortality is associated with chronic conditions. For persons aged 65 years and over the riskABOUT FLUZONE\u00aeHigh-Dose ABOUT FLUZONE \u00ae High-Dose DEMONSTRATED EVIDENCE Bronchitis & Pneumoni a FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose vaccine is the only vaccine demonstrated, through a large randomized study, to be more e cacious than FLUZONE\u00ae standard-dose vaccine in preventing infl uenza e cacy against lab-con rmed infl uenza-like illness caused by any strain compared to FLUZONE\u00ae, a standard-dose vaccine (phase 3B-4 trial) in adults 65 years of age and older.1,2# Relative e cacy vs FLUZONE\u00ae, a standard- B strains1,2 is the demonstrated safety pro/f_i le of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose? The safety pro le of FLUZONE\u00ae was demonstrated in 2 large clinical trials comparing FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose and FLUZONE\u00ae, a standard-dose vaccine. Study 1 compared safety and immunogenicity in 3,833 individuals 65 +:1\u00a7 Within 6 months after vaccination, 6.1% of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose vaccine recipients and 7.4% of FLUZONE\u00ae vaccine recipients experienced a serious adverse event. Study 2 compared e cacy and safety in 31,803 individuals 65 + over two infl uenza seasons:1\u00a3 Within 6 to 8 months after vaccination, 8.3% of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose vaccine recipients and 9.0% of FLUZONE\u00ae vaccine recipients experienced a serious adverse event.Frequency of solicited systemic adverse events and injection-site reactions within 7 days post-vaccination (phase 3 trial)1 Most of the reactions resolved within 3 days.1 How is FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose administered? FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose should be administered as a single 0.5 mL injection by the intramuscular route. FLUZONE\u00ae does not contain gelatin, antibiotics, thimerosal or latex (natural rubber) and is considered safe for use in persons with latex allergies. FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose is available in packages of 5 x 0.5 mL (single dose pre lled syringes. Approximately 112 million doses have been distributed in the United States between 2009 and 2018.23 Contraindications: Known severe allergic reaction to egg protein or any component of the vaccine or after previous administration of FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose or a vaccine containing the same components or constituents. Relevant warnings and precautions: FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose is not indicated for persons less than 65 years of age. As with any vaccine, immunization with FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose may not protect 100% of individuals. Protection is limited to those strains of virus from which the vaccine is prepared or against closely related strains. Do not administer FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose by intravascular injection. Do not administer into the buttocks. Postpone vaccination in case of moderate severe febrile illness or acute disease. Administer FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose with caution in persons su ering fromcoagulation disorders or on anticoagulation therapy. Immunocompromised persons (whether from disease or treatment) may not elicit the expected immune response. Avoid vaccinating persons who are known to have experienced Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after a previous infl uenza vaccination.
