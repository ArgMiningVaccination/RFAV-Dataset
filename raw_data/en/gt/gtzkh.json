However, if we consider major infectious agents, such as human immunodeciency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Malaria, despite many years of eort, billions of dollars spentandcountlessanimallivessacriced,novaccineisavailabletoprotectagainsttheseinfections. How did this happen? What prevents us from being victorious? In this issue of Frontier in Microbiology, we examine why some of these vaccines have failed, collecting reflections from leadingresearchersintheeld. Someofthekeyobstaclestovaccinedevelopmentdiscussedinthisissueinclude: 1.Thegeneticdiversityofthetargetpathogen. InRNAvirusessuchasHIVandHCV,theerror prone RNA dependent John a nd Gaudieri, 2014; Ondondo, 2014). In addition, influenza vaccines need to be reformulated a nnually, due to antigenic drift (Quinones-Parra et al., 2014). Over half a century of malaria v accinedevelopment,despiteawarenessofthediversityofnaturalparasitepopulations,vaccines that have progressed to human clinical trials have only included a small fraction of the polymorphisms present in endemic regions. In addition to increasing the complexity of the immunogen, antigenic diversity of the organism in dierent geographic regions has major implications for vaccine ecacy. In this issue, Alyssa Barry and Alicia Arnott discuss the importance of population genetic studies in identifying functionally relevant polymorphisms, and argue that molecular epidemiological surveys are necessary to ensure that the vaccine strain corresponds to the local target parasite populations ( Barry and Arnott, 2014). Targeting c onserved pathogen antigens may help to overcome diversity, although these regions are often concealedand/orlessaccessibletoimmuneeectors.Indeed,Chiuandcolleagueshereinshowed that antibody titers to PfRh5 correlated with protection against Plasmodium falciparum in clinicaltrialsinPNG(Chiuetal.,2014).Moreover,Quinones-Parraandcolleaguesalsoshowed t hat broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved regions, which developed naturally followingthe2009influenzapandemic,providehintstothenatureoftheresponsesasuccessful vaccine should elicit ( Quinones-Parra et al., 2014). As an example of this strategy, Drummer a nd colleagues proposed that the conserved regions within HCV E2, especially the residues that interact with the virus co-receptor CD81 ( Drummer, 2014), may represent an attractive i mmunogeninaHCVvaccine.Li et al. HIV/HCV and Malaria Vaccine Failure 2.The discrepancy between immunogenicity and protection. As highlighted in this issue, although many HIV vaccine candidatesinducestrongTandBcellresponsesinpre-clinical and Phase-I trials, these responses have thus far failed to correlate with protection in larger scale trials ( Chanzu and Ondondo, 2014 cytokine staining or antibody le vels do not appear to be adequate measures that predict vaccine success or failure. New strategies of clinical trial monito ring, such as those depicting immunogenicity from a new angle, or those that dissociate the eects of the vaccine vector from vaccineantigen,mayneedtobedevelopedandapplied.These could include analysis of the T and B cell immune repertoire (Li et al., 2013 ), which might identify the clonotype response to the vector independent of responses to the immunogen. In addition, whole genome transcription arrays and other recent high throughput assays are likely to provide new and unexpected insights. Overall, new concepts are required to dene the best reference or readout of immunogenicity that mayinturnpredictprotectiveecacy. 3.Vector or Immunogen, which one matters? While an eective vaccine may need to be multivalent, comprising multiple alleles for a given polymorphic antigen, and/or the antigen derived from conserved regions, the delivery vector s areatleastasimportantastheimmunogenitself.Thevectors modulate innate and adaptive immunity, hopefully enabling the vaccine antigen to elicit the right response ( Ondondo, 2014). Prime-boost strategies using plasmid DNA or viral vector prime followed by protein or viral vector boost have been studied extensively. An important lesson was learned from the HIV STEP study, in which a highly immunogenic vaccine actually increased HIV acquisition, presumably due to preexisting immunity to the vector. Of the proposed explanations, a strong response to the vector may have activated CD4+T cells, which are targets for HIV. This seemingly unavoidable paradox highlights the challenges of HIVvaccinedevelopment. 4.The discrepancy between local and systemic responses. Raerty and colleagues argue that of the vectors used in HIV vaccine design, viral vectors with mucosal tropism, e.g., adenoviruses and influenza viruses, are particularly interesting, given that genitorectal mucosa is the rst sit e of contact in HIV transmission ( Raerty et al., 2014 ). Most systemic vaccines do not elicit mucosal responses, and it is uncertain if mucosal delivery of antigen can induce systemi c immunity. Cytokines and chemokines have been used as adjuvants to encourage mucosal homing of immune eector cells, such as the \"prime-pull\" approach in animal models (Raertyetal.,2014 ).Dicultiesinstudyingmucosalimmune responses, including low cell numbers, sample variation and invasiveness of mucosal sampling means that mucosal immune responses are often not examined in clinical trials, as discussed in this issue ( Chanzu and Ondondo, 2014 ). This is an important area of future clinical trial monitoring and is being addressed. An eective HIV vaccine strategy may need to involve both systemic and mucosal approaches simultaneously.Indeed,womeninthirdworldcountriesshar ethe major burden of HIV infection, and a vaccine that can eectively elicit mucosal immune responses in the female genital tract is more likely to protect women ( Raerty et al., 2014). 5.Infant vaccination, how much do we know? On a global scale, millions of infants receive around 20 vaccines durin g the rst year of life, but relatively few studies have examin ed the development of immunity in this age group. The innate immune system does not reach full capacity until the teenage years, and as adaptive immunity in newborns is intrinsically skewed to a Th2-type, the neonatal and infant immune responses to many vaccines are suboptimal ( Ndure and Flanagan, 2014 ). In addition, the na\u00efve immune repertoire's initial response to a vaccine, which may engage both vaccine antigen-specic and non-specic T and B cells, promoted for example by inflammation via the TNFR2 receptor ( Wilson et al., 2015 ), may play an important role in shaping the repertoire toward subsequent unrelated pathogens. Indeed, growingevidencesuggeststhatvaccinescanhaveheterolog ous eects, aecting an individual's subsequent responses to unrelated pathogens or vaccines ( Flanagan et al., 2011 ). As vaccines which target major global diseases are eventually likely to be included in childhood vaccination, it is importa nt to understand how vaccines modulate the na\u00efve immune systemandthelong-termimpactofthisintervention. 6.Immune subversion and immunosuppression. Malaria- infected red blood cells have an amazing capacity to induce FOXP3+expression, a marker of highly suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg), on co-cultured autologous T cells, that widespread induction in vivowould not requiredirectcontactwiththeparasite( Scholzenetal.,2014 ). In an exciting mechanistic insight, in this issue, Wykes and colleagues further show a role for PD-1 in malaria-induced loss of T cell function and/or apoptosis ( Wykes et al., 2014 ). While it is not feasible to directly predict viral epitopes recognized by the T cell receptor, Moise and colleagues show that the JanusMatrix algorithm can be applied to achieve this by searching for virus-encoded human homologs, which theoretically can be recognized by Treg ( Moise et al., 2014 ). We also propose that to design improved vaccines we need to better understand how genetic factors such as HLA can aectviralsusceptibility.Forexample,inadditiontoHIVand HCV which interfere with HLA expression in host immune cells, could HLA intrinsically influence T cell repertoire developmentbeforetheselectionstep? Regardless of the chances of developing a prophylactic vaccine for every disease, the world needs vaccines to reduce current disease burdens and save lives.
