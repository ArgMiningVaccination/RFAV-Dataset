Clin Cancer Res; 20(5); 1375-82. \u00a92014 AACR. In immunotherapy using anti-GD2 or anti-GD3 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) has proven beneficial against high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) and melanoma. This article presents results of a phase I study of a vaccine designed to induce host anti-ganglioside antibodies that can replicate the antineoplastic activities of intravenously administered MoAbs. Patients also received -glucan, which synergizes with anti-GD2/GD3 MoAbs. The vaccine/-glucan treatment was well tolerated, and serological and minimal residual disease (MRD) responses were encouraging. Multiple factors may account for the excellent relapse-free survival despite prior relapse, which historically conferred a dismal prognosis. This phase I experience could have a major impact on treatment of HR-NB. Thus, a phase II trial is already in progress; the results might support vaccine/-glucan as adjuvant after completion of the standard upfront HR-NB multimodality program. The latter now includes anti-GD2 MoAb but additional nontoxic therapy for MRD is eagerly sought, to help further improve outcome. Introduction Relapse of high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) has long been viewed as tantamount to eventual death from progressive disease or toxicity ( [1](javascript:;)). We hypothesize that active humoral immunity could maintain second or subsequent remission even among these ultra-high-risk patients. This curative approach starts from diagnosis and has several components. First, patients in initial remission undergo close monitoring, with extent-of-disease evaluations at least every 3 months through 3 years from diagnosis; the aim is to detect focal relapse early, which may be more amenable to successful salvage than a widespread relapse with a large tumor burden ( [2](javascript:;)). Second, relapse is treated with a multimodality program that comprises surgery and/or radiotherapy for local control, plus salvage chemotherapy combining agents with well-established anti-neuroblastoma activity and tailored to the patient's particular clinical context or past treatment history ( [3-8](javascript:;)). Third, after achieving a maximal response with the standard modalities (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), remission is consolidated via immunotherapy using monoclonal antibody (MoAb) or vaccine, the latter being the subject of this report. The vaccine is designed to induce antibodies against gangliosides GD2 and GD3, which are highly expressed on neuroblastoma. Indeed, the intensity of ganglioside expression on neuroblastoma is unique. Although melanoma (considered a ganglioside-rich tumor) yields a median of 43 mcg of GD3 per gram of tissue biopsied and 3.1 mcg of GD2, neuroblastoma yields a similar level of GD3 but 10\u00d7 higher levels of GD2 [9](javascript:;) and [10](javascript:;)). GD2 and GD3 are also expressed on peripheral nerves and brain, and treatment with anti-GD2/GD3 MoAbs causes pain ( [11-13](javascript:;)), but spares the central nervous system, presumably because of the blood-brain barrier. Preclinical studies and clinical trials of vaccines in adults showed immunogenicity significantly augmented by (1) stabilizing GD2 and GD3 through lactone formation; (2) conjugating the resulting (L for lactone) the immunologic protein hemocyanin was 30 mcg per vaccine ( [18,19](javascript:;)). For QS-21, doses of 50 to 200 mcg were tested and found safe, with side effects of grade 3 erythema and flu-like symptoms lasting 2 to 4 days ( [20](javascript:;)). When QS-21 became unavailable, we turned to OPT-821, which is a QS-21 equivalent based on 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography studies, and overlapping immunogenicity and toxicity profiles in mice. We now report a phase I trial involving children with HR-NB in second or later remission, treated with a GD2/GD3 vaccine containing OPT-821. Patients also received -glucan, which has a broad range of immunostimulant effects ( [21-23](javascript:;)) and to CR3 (Mac-1), a widely expressed on ( [21](javascript:;)). This receptor and stimulates phagocytosis, degranulation, and tumor cytotoxicity. Many bacteria and fungi carry activating ligands for CR3, which renders them vulnerable to phagocytosis by neutrophils. Human tumors lack such molecules and CR3-mediated tumor lysis is suboptimal until it is activated by or by ligands such as -glucan ( [27](javascript:;)). Materials and Methods The primary objective of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) protocol 05-075 phase I trial (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00911560) was to find the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) in children of the immunologic adjuvant OPT-821 in a vaccine containing 2 neuroblastoma-associated antigens (GD2 and GD3). Secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary data on anti-GD2 and anti-GD3 immune response and anti-neuroblastoma activity against minimal residual disease (MRD). Patient selection This study enrolled patients 21 years old with HR-NB who had previously relapsed but had achieved a 2nd complete/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR). Disease status was confirmed 3 weeks after other therapy by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan, bone marrow histology (aspirates and biopsies from bilateral posterior and anterior iliac crests), and urine catecholamines. Using international criteria ( [28](javascript:;)) expanded to include 123I-MIBG findings, complete remission was defined as absence of neuroblastoma by all studies, and VGPR was defined as the primary mass reduced 90%, no evidence of active distant disease, and urine catecholamines normal. There were no eligibility criteria/limits about prior therapy. Major organ toxicity was required to be grade 3, except neurologic status had to be grade 1, by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0), and the absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts each had to be 500/L. Informed written consents for treatment and tests were obtained according to MSKCC Institutional Review Board rules. Study design Treatment included 7 subcutaneous injections of the vaccine administered weeks 1-2-3-8-20-32-52 ( [Fig. 1](javascript:;)). The vaccine contained 30 g of GD2L and 30 g of GD3L, each conjugated to KLH, for all patients, but OPT-821 dosing depended on dosage level and body-surface area. Four OPT-821 dosage levels were planned: 50, 75, 100, and 150 g/m2; the dose was \"capped\" with the maximal dose being 75, 110, 150, or 200 g at the respective dosage levels. [Close modal](javascript:;) Oral -glucan was started week 6 ( [Fig. 1](javascript:;)), to allow time for generation of antibodies. Dosage (40 mg/kg/day, 14 days on/14 days off) was identical for all patients and derived from the phase I MSKCC protocol 05-073 (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00492167). -Glucan [a botanical of (1 3),(1 6)--glycosidic linkage from baker's yeast, manufactured by Biotec Pharmacon ASA Inc.] was supplied as an aqueous solution at 20 mg/mL and stored at room temperature. Patients continued on study in the absence of relapse (new lesion) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Disease status was assessed every 10 to 12 weeks by extensive evaluations. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Using the CTCAEv3.0, DLT was defined as: grade 2 allergic reaction; grade 2 autoimmune reaction; grade 3 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity; grade 3 injection site reaction; grade 2 neurotoxicity in patients with no prior neurologic deficit, or worsening of a grade 1 neurotoxicity to grade 2. DLT assessment excluded toxicity related to disease activity, prior therapy, or cointerventions. Vaccine injections were performed if liver function tests were grade 1 toxicity. For grade 2 or 3 toxicity, injections were deferred until a return to grade 1. A standard dose-escalation schema was used: escalations were implemented if 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients at a given dosage level had DLT. At least 6 patients were studied at the MTD, or at the highest planned level (i.e., 150 mcg/m2) if there were no DLTs. Materials GD2 and GD3 were obtained from Matreya Inc., with GD2 prepared via extraction of GD1b from rabbit brain followed by treatment with bull testis -galactosidase ( and instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC). Clinical grade KLH was acquired from Sigma Chemicals Inc., and clinical grade OPT-821 from Optimer Pharmaceuticals Inc. For conjugation of gangliosides to KLH, ozone was used to cleave the ceramide double bond, an aldehyde group was introduced, and this product was coupled to amino groups on KLH by reductive amination as described ( [18](javascript:;)). The ratio of antigen to KLH in the final conjugates was determined using the resorcinol method for measuring sialic acid and the Bio-Rad dye-binding method. The percent unconjugated antigen in the final vialed conjugates was determined by ITLC using MoAbs against each antigen; <10% unconjugated antigen was permitted. This vaccine was used under an IND held by MSKCC, BBIND 4976. The GD2-KLH and GD3-KLH were converted to GD2L-KLH and GD3L-KLH by treatment with equal volume of conjugates and glacial acetic acid (v/v) \u00d7 3 to 4 hours at 37\u00b0C and lyophilized, as described ( [19](javascript:;)). Vaccine was vialed in the MSKCC Clinical Grade Production Facility. Vials were stored at 80\u00b0C. GD2L-KLH and GD3L-KLH were vialed together in sterile water containing 33 or 36 g of each ganglioside per vial and lyophilized. OPT-821 was vialed in normal saline at 100 or 200 g/0.5 mL, or at 150 g/mL. Vaccine preparation. On the day of vaccination, the prescribed dose +10% of OPT-821 was diluted with normal saline to a final volume of 1.1 or 1.2 mL for the 33 or 36 g vials of GD2L-KLH and GD3L-KLH, respectively. The resulting solution was refrigerated at 4\u00b0C \u00d71 hour. For administration, 1 mL (containing 30 g of GD2L-KLH and of GD3L-KLH) was drawn into a syringe and injected subcutaneously in a single site. Serology. Anti-GD2 and anti-GD3 antibodies were detected by ELISA. In brief, 20 ng/well of GD2 or GD3 was coated on CDGH rows of 96-well microtiter plates and air-dried overnight. Blocking step was performed using 200 L/well of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1\u00d7 PBS \u00d71 hour at room temperature, and washed with 1\u00d7 PBS. Patient serum diluted in 1:10 and 1:30 in 0.5% BSA in duplicate was added to the designated wells with and without GD2/GD3 at 50 L/well. For anti-GD2 assay, anti-GD2 antibody Hu3F8-IgG1 was used to generate a standard curve at concentrations ranging from 1.23 to 100 ng/mL. Both standards and samples were incubated \u00d72.5 hours at 37\u00b0C. After washing with anti-human IgG1 ( specific) at 1:1,000 L/well. Upon incubation at 4\u00b0C \u00d71 hour and washing with PBS, color reaction with chromogen o-phenylenediamine, and substrate hydrogen peroxide was added to the plates \u00d730 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Reaction was stopped using sulfuric acid, and optical density read using ELISA plate reader at 490 nm. For GD2 assay, test sera were quantified in ng/mL based on the standard curve; positivity was defined as an increase of at least 10 ng/mL over pretreatment levels. For GD3 assay, sera were defined as positive when titer at 1:10 was greater than 0.1 O.D. after background subtraction. MRD detection. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used as described ( [13,29,30](javascript:;)) to assess MRD in heparinized bone marrow aspirates pooled from 4 sites (2-2.5 mL/site, from bilateral posterior and anterior endogenous control, and neuroblastoma cell line NMB7 as the positive control. Each sample was quantified using the comparative threshold cycle method as fold-difference relative to NMB7. All gene expression positivity was defined as greater than the upper limit of normal. All samples were run in duplicates. MRD panel positivity was defined as any one of 4 markers being positive, and negativity as all 4 markers being negative. Results Patient characteristics The study was completed with 15 patients (enrolled July 2009-November 2010) because there was no DLT and OPT-821 dosing reached that used in adults ( [Table 1](javascript:;)). At enrollment, patients were 3.3 to 16.7 (median 8.1) years old. All patients had stage 4 neuroblastoma, 11 were in 2nd and 4 in 3rd CR/VGPR. Five (33%) patients had MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. The time from diagnosis to first relapse was <12 months (n = 2), 12 to 18 months (n = 5), 19 to 24 months (n = 4), and >24 months (n = 4). Retrieval therapy before study enrollment included local control with radiotherapy alone (n = 7), radiotherapy plus surgery (n = 7), strongly myelosuppressive chemotherapy (n = 8),5-8 and nonimmunosuppressive treatments such as (n = 5); no patient underwent stem-cell transplantation as part of retrieval. These retrieval treatments were for relapses that were localized in 10 patients, including soft tissue (n = 7) or osteomedullary by MIBG and MRI (n = 3), and widespread in 5 patients, including bone marrow by histology and MIBG scan (n = 2), multifocal MIBG osteomedullary with (n = 1) or without (n = 1) soft tissue, and retroperitoneal nodes plus brain (n = 1). level 1 = 50 g/m2, dose level 2 = 75 g/m2, dose level 3 = 100 g/m2, and dose level 4 = 150 g/m2. bNumber of prior vaccine injections on this protocol is in parentheses. Survival and toxicity Thirteen of fifteen patients received all 7 protocol-prescribed injections of vaccine, including 12 patients who remain relapse-free at 21+ to 36+ (median 29+) months and one who had a focal relapse (supraclavicular node) at 21 months. Two patients had early focal relapses (2.3 and 4.6 months). All 3 relapses were among patients receiving 100 to 150 g/m2 of OPT-821, including 1 with MYCN-amplified and 2 with MYCN-nonamplified neuroblastoma. months). One relapse-free survivor received a cycle of chemotherapy because of radiologic findings deemed suspicious for soft tissue relapse of his MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma; laparotomy revealed no evidence of neuroblastoma, so patient was allowed to resume the vaccine/-glucan immunotherapy. [Close modal](javascript:;) Treatment was well tolerated, with no DLT, delays in administration of vaccine, co-interventions, or neurologic sequelae. There was no relation between OPT-821 dosage and side effects. Injections were painful and elicited grade 1 local reactions in 12 patients (varying from 1 to 4 injections per patient) and a grade 2 local reaction in one patient (dose level 1, with injection #7); these side effects subsided within 24 hours. No other grade 2 toxicities of protocol treatment were noted. One patient had a grade 3 elevation in liver function enzymes on day 5 after injection #2 (dose level 1). The only other grade 3 to 4 toxicities\u2014all self-limited and attributable to prior therapy or intercurrent events\u2014were concurrent hypocalcemia and hypokalemia (1 patient), lymphopenia (1 patient), and neutropenia (1 patient). Serological response Patient serum for assessment of anti-GD2 and anti-GD3 titers was collected before vaccine injection #1 and after the subsequent injections. Seropositive response was defined as negative titer at baseline, and positive titer anytime, whereas seronegative response was defined as negative titer at baseline and all subsequent time points tested. Three of fifteen patients had seronegative response. The rest of them became seropositive against GD2 alone (n = 2), GD3 alone (n = 3), or both (n = 7; [Table 1](javascript:;)). Anti-GD2 seropositivity was documented after cycles #2 (n = 1), #3 (n = 2), #4 (n = 5), and #7 (n = 1). Anti-GD3 seropositivity was documented after cycles #3 (n = 2), #4 (n = 2), #6 (n = 2), and #7 (n = 4) MRD response At study enrollment, all 15 patients had complete remission in bone marrow by histology. Response with respect to MRD was assessed by comparing bone marrow collected at baseline before vaccine injection #1 versus after the last injection. Of 11 patients who were MRD positive at baseline, 6 became MRD negative, 4 remained MRD positive, and 1 patient in continual remission was not retested for MRD because there was no available sample ( [Table 1](javascript:;)). Four patients were MRD negative at baseline and remained MRD negative. MRD nonresponse did not correlate with relapse. Discussion This phase I trial in patients with HR-NB in 2nd CR/VGPR assessed the toxicity of escalating dosages of the immunologic adjuvant OPT-821 in a bivalent vaccine containing GD2L and GD3L, each covalently attached to the immunologic carrier protein KLH. The patients also took the oral immunostimulant -glucan. Because thirteen of fifteen study patients received all 7 injections of the protocol, the study's primary objective about safe dosing of OPT-821 was achieved. Treatments were devoid of acute toxicities aside from local reactions immediately postinjection. No delayed toxicities developed, alleviating concerns about neurotoxicity given GD2/GD3 expression on peripheral nerves and in brain. Prolonged oral intake of -glucan by the children in this study was uncomplicated, consistent with the absence of major side effects in preclinical animal models and in human adults. Although the absence of toxicity with the bivalent vaccine and -glucan seems well established, anti-neuroblastoma efficacy should be interpreted with great caution. The study patients achieved excellent RFS ( [Fig. 2](javascript:;)), in contrast to dismal predictions based on the international experience with relapsed HR-NB ( [31-33](javascript:;)), and without myeloablative therapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation, which is widely used as consolidation of first or subsequent remissions. Yet the contributory role of, for example, -glucan to RFS is uncertain, and major confounding factors included patient selection and the proximity and complexity of therapy before vaccine treatment. Nevertheless, twelve of fifteen patients mounted an anti-disialoganglioside immune response, and bone marrow MRD response (from positive to negative) occurred in 60% of evaluable patients. All 3 patients who progressed had complete remission of bone marrow MRD. It is of note that 2 patients had isolated progression (1 in a neck node and 1 in left ichium) with continual marrow remission for 17 months and 24+ months. The third patient progressed with a new paraspinal soft tissue mass with only 1 of 6 marrow samples turning positive, and had negative marrow aspirates and biopsies (total of 60 samples) alive and well at 41+ months since. The inability of bone marrow MRD to detect extramedullary isolated relapse was analyzed in a recent publication, showing early negative MRD in bone marrow after immunotherapy was less predictive of late or nonmarrow relapse among patients with high-risk stage 4 neuroblastoma ( [34](javascript:;)). Vaccine therapy in neuroblastoma has T-cell immunity. Syngeneic or transfected with both induced major responses in patients ( [36,37](javascript:;)). Dendritic cells expanded in vitro and \"pulsed\" with crude cell lysates or tumor RNA have also been tested in children ( [38,39](javascript:;)). Unfortunately, to date, specific CTLs (e.g., against survivin) have not been shown to home to neuroblastoma in patients ( [40](javascript:;)). Furthermore, T-cell immunity has been limited by the state of immunosuppression following dose-intensive chemotherapy. In this study, the successful induction of anti-GD2 and anti-GD3 antibodies using lactone-KLH in the presence of OPT-821 in patients despite prior history of immunosuppressive chemotherapy is encouraging. In preclinical models ( [41,42](javascript:;)) and trials ( [11-13](javascript:;)), immunotherapy MoAbs against neuroblastoma and melanoma. Benefit is optimal in the adjuvant setting, with ablation micrometastasis leukocytes of all types, including neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells. Our bivalent vaccine is constructed with the purpose of inducing host anti-ganglioside antibodies that can replicate the antineoplastic effects of exogenously administered MoAbs. Various strategies have undergone clinical testing to induce or augment immune-mediated attack against cancer ( [44](javascript:;)). Few clinical trials, however, have used humoral vaccines against solid tumors in children, especially with ADCC and CMC as the principal underlying immunocytotoxic mechanisms ( [45](javascript:;)). Also, an antineoplastic role for myeloid cells (e.g., neutrophils) has received scant attention ( [27](javascript:;)). A treatment program combining an anti-neuroblastoma vaccine with an agent that enhances granulocyte cytotoxicity (i.e., -glucan) represents a novel strategy to maximize this myeloid effect in the emerging field of immunotherapy. The setting of this protocol is an ideal model system to assess anticancer vaccine therapy: patients with a low disease burden, but at great risk for relapse; target antigens highly expressed on the cancerous but not normal tissues; immunological adjuvants (KLH and OPT-821) to optimize against the target antigens (GD2 and GD3); and a nontoxic oral agent (-glucan) to enhance effector cytotoxicity. The basis for emphasis on multivalent vaccines is tumor-cell heterogeneity, variability of the immune response among patients, and the correlation between the concentration of tumor-selective antibody and effector mechanisms (opsonization, ADCC, and CMC). In the adjuvant setting, prolonged presence of antineoplastic antibodies should be more efficient against MRD. Maintenance of antibodies over months or years is more readily achieved with vaccines than MoAbs where repeated administrations are necessary and human anti-mouse or anti-human blocking antibodies can develop. We speculate that the fluctuations of anti-GD2 titer in vaccinated patients could represent multiple idiotypes within an idiotypic network whereas unimodal anti-GD2 response could represent ineffective idiotypes associated with an unfavorable outcome ( [46-48](javascript:;)). Alternatively, these fluctuations could represent random oscillations of unknown significance. In conclusion, the bivalent-vaccine/-glucan immunotherapy program engenders no major toxicity, even in heavily prior-treated children, and is readily transportable to multiple institutions. Patients have no neuropathic pain, unlike patients receiving intravenous anti-GD2 or anti-GD3 MoAbs. Serological and MRD responses were encouraging. Multiple factors may account for the excellent RFS. This limited experience provides support for pursuing an aggressive curative strategy against relapsed HR-NB. In addition, unlike most pediatric phase I studies, this one could have a major impact on treatment of HR-NB. Thus, a phase II trial is already in progress, using the phase I study's maximum OPT-821 dosage (150 g/m2); the results might support vaccine-glucan as adjuvant after completion of the standard upfront HR-NB multimodality program. The latter now includes anti-GD2 MoAb ( [12](javascript:;)) but additional nontoxic therapy for MRD is eagerly sought, to help further improve outcome.
