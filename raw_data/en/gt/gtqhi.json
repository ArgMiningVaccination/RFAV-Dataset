HEPLISAV-B is now approved for prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in adults 18 years of age or older.1,2 DISEASE BACKGROUND Hepatitis B virus is a highly infectious and resilient disease that can lead to serious complications and death.3 It remains an important cause of acute and chronic liver disease, and is a major global health p roblem associated with high healthcare costs.4 In the United States, chronic HBV infection is a widespread and growing public health challen ge, with an estimated prevalence of 850,000 to 2.2 million peop le living with HBV.5 Since 2014, there has been an increase in the rate of new HBV i nfections.5 The heroin and opioid epidemics are among significant contributing causes to the increase in HBV infection rates, wit h some states affected by the epidemics having experienced a 11 4% increase in HBV infection rates from 2006 to 2013.6 Each year, an estimated 5,000 individuals in the United States die from chronic liver disease due to HBV infection.4 There is no cure for HBV infection, and effective vaccination i s critical to reducing the spread of the disease.7 Despite historical vaccination and public awareness efforts, chronic HBV infection remains a s ignificant cause of morbidity and mortality.4 Conventional (alum-adjuvanted) HBV vaccines require 3 doses given over 6 months to achieve pro tection in adult patients, which presents compliance challenges that may potentially leave patients at risk.8-10 A Vaccine Safety Datalink study of more than 88,000 adult hepa titis B vaccine recipients found that 81% received at least 2 doses and only 54% received all 3 doses wit hin 1 year.11,* The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Advisory Committee on Imm unization Practices (ACIP) includes recommendations for HBV vaccinations, including proactive vaccination of adults at risk for HBV infection.7 *Calculation based on a weighted average of patients aged 18 ye ars or older (n=88,711) initiating a hepatitis B vaccination se ries in a large population-based, retrospective cohort study of the Vaccine Safety Datalink popul ation of approximately 8.8 million medical care organization en rollees. HEPLISAV-B BACKGROUND HEPLISAV-B is manufactured by Dyn avax Technologies Corporation and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 9, 2017.2 This approval was based on data from 3 head-to-head, phase 3 n oninferiority trials of HEPLISAV-B versus Engerix\u00ae-B comprising nearly 10,000 adult participants who received HEPLIS AV-B.1 Two doses of HEPLISAV-B in 1 month provided higher rates of protective immunity to 90% or more of patients in the groups st udied versus Engerix-B, including patients with factors that ty pically affect the immune response, such as older (>40 years of age) adults, men, persons with diabetes, obese persons, and persons who smoke.1,4 The safety and effectiveness of H EPLISAV-B have not been establishe d in individuals less than 18 years of age.1 HEPLISAV-B contains a TLR9-agoni st adjuvant that was shown in c linical studies to allow for improved immune responses after on ly 2 doses, including in populations that may respond poorly to current vac cines.4 HEPLISAV-B offers a 2-d ose regimen with a s horter administratio n schedule and a reduced burden of administration compared with conventional vaccines.4 INDICATION AND USAGE HEPLISAV-B is indicated for preve ntion of infection caused by a ll known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. HEPLISAV-B is approved for use in adults 18 years of age and older.1 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer 2 doses (0. 5 mL each) of HEPLISAV-B intramuscularly, 1 month apart.1 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Infection with HBV can have serious consequences, including acu te massive hepatic necrosis and chronic active hepatitis. Chron ically infected persons are at increased risk for cirrhosis and hepato cellular carcinoma. Antibody concentrations 10 mIU/mL against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are reco gnized as conferring protection against HBV infection.1 HEPLISAV-B is considered to act b y using an adjuvant that activ ates TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that, with HBsAg, leads to production of HBsAg-specific antibodies.2 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION1 Do not administer HEPLISAV-B to individuals with a history of s evere allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B vaccine or to any component of HEPLISAV-B, including yeast. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administra tion of HEPLISAV-B. Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immu nosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to HEPLISAV-B. Hepatitis B has a long incubation period. HEPLISAV-B may not pr event hepatitis B infection in individuals who have an unrecogn ized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration. The most common patient-reported adverse reactions reported wit hin 7 days of vaccination were injection site pain (23%-39%), f atigue (11%- 17%), and headache (8%-17%).

Seroprotection rates (SPRs) following injection with 2 doses of HEPLISAV-B wer e compared with rates following injection with 3 doses of Enger ix-B. In all 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 mon th followed by placebo (saline) at 6 months, whereas Engerix-B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months.1 Two doses of HEPLISAV-B provided h igher rates of protection (9 0%) in more adults across 3 pivotal clinical trials compared wi th 3 doses of Engerix-B.1 Study 1: HBV-10 2: HBV-16 HBV-23 (n=961*)1 18-55 years of age 40-70 years of age Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, 18-70 years of age *In Study 3, the immunogenicity population comprised 4537 subje cts who received HEPLISAV-B and 2289 subjects who received Enge rix-B. The primary analysis above shows outcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.1 SAFETY OUTCOMES The safety profile of HEPLISAV-B was demonstrated in 3 pivotal clinical trials of nearly 10,000 subjects with up to 12 months of follow-up.1 The overall safety profile of H EPLISAV-B was similar to that of Engerix-B4: HEPLISAV-B had a lower frequency of systemic postinjection rea ctions (including fever) and a similar frequency of local posti njection reactions compared with Engerix-B Adverse events (AEs) and medically-attended AEs were balanced in type and frequency between the HEPLISAV-B and Engerix-B treatment groups Frequency of immune-mediated disease in recipients of HEPLISAV -B was balanced with that of Engerix-B The most common local reaction was injection site pain (23%-39% ). The most common systemic reactions were fatigue (11%-17%) an d headache (8%-17%).1 BILLING CODES : FOR ONLY NDC1 10-digit NDC number: for intramuscular HCPCS13 G0010; administration of hepatitis MVX CODE15 Hepatitis Current Procedural Terminology ; CVX, vaccine Healthcare Common Proc edure Coding System; ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification ; MVX, manufacturers of vaccines; NDC, national drug code. *CPT is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association (AMA).

HEPLISAV -B may not prevent hepatitis B infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 9597 individuals 18 through 70 years of age received at least 1 dose of HEPLISAV -B in 5 clinical trials conducted in the United States, Canada, and Germany. Data from three of these trials are provided below. Study 1 in Subjects 18 through 55 Years of Age Study 1 was a randomized, observer -blind, active -controlled, multicenter study in Canada and Germany in which 1810 subjects received at least 1 dose of HEPLISAV -B and 605 subjects received at least 1 dose of Engerix -B\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)]. Enrolled subjects had no history of hepatitis B vaccination or infection. HEPLISAV -B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 month followed by saline placebo at 6 months. Engerix -B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months . In the total study population, the mean age was 40 years ; 46% of the subjects were men ; 93% were white, 2% black, 3% Asian and 3% Hispanic 26% 10% had diabetes mellitus . These d emographic and baseline characteristics were similar in both vaccine groups. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Subjects were monitored for local and systemic adverse reactions using diary cards for a 7-day period starting on the day of vaccination. The percentages of subjects who reported local and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1.

Clinical trial number: NCT00435812 *HEPLISAV -B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 month followed by saline placebo at 6 months. Engerix -B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months Redness and swelling 2.5 cm. Oral temperature 100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C). Unsolicited Adverse Events: Unsolicited adverse events within 28 days following any injection , including placebo , were reported by 42.0% of HEPLISAV -B recipients and 41.3% of Engerix -B recipients. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Subjects were monitored for serious adverse events for 7 months after the first dose of vaccine. The percentage of subjects reporting serious adverse events was 1.5% in the HEPLISAV -B group and 2.1% in the Engerix -B group. No acute myocardial infarctions were reported. No deaths were reported. Potentially Immune -mediated Adverse Events Potentially immune -mediated adverse e vents that occurred within 7 months of the first dose of vaccine were reported in 0.2% (n = 4) of HEPLISAV -B recipients and 0.7% (n = 4) of Engerix -B recipients. The following events were reported in the HEPLISAV -B group in one subject each: planus, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and Grave's disease. The following events were reported in the Engerix -B group in one subject each: Bell's palsy, and Grave's disease . One additional Engerix -B recipient with a history of mixed connective tissue disease had p- ANCA -positive vasculitis. Study 2 in Subjects 40 through 70 Years of Age Study 2 was a randomized, observer -blind, active -controlled, multicenter study in Canada and the United States in which 1968 subjects received at least 1 dose of HEPLISAV -B and 481 subjects received at least 1 dose of Engerix -B. HEPLISAV -B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 month followed by saline placebo at 6 months. Enrolled subjects had no history of hepatitis B vaccination or infection. Engerix -B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months. In the total population, the mean age was 54 years ; 48% of subjects were men; 82% were white, 15% black, Asian and 44% 30% hypertension, 30% dyslipidemia, and 8% had diabetes mellitus. These d emographic and baseline characteristics were similar in both vaccine groups. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Subjects were monitored for local and systemic adverse reactions using diary cards for a 7-day period starting on the day of vaccination. The percentages of subjects who experienced local and systemic reactions are shown in Table 2.

Clinical Trial Number: NCT01005407 *HEPLISAV -B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 month followed by saline placebo at 6 months. Engerix -B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months Redness and swelling 2.5 cm Oral temperature 100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C). Unsolicited Adverse Events : Unsolicited adverse events within 28 days following any injection , including placebo, were reported by 35.4% of HEPLISAV -B recipients and 36.2% of Engerix -B recipients. Serious Adverse Events Subjects were monitored for serious adverse events for 12 months after the first dose of vaccine. The percentage of subjects reporting serious adverse events was 3.9% in the HEPLISAV -B group and 4.8% in (n=1) of Engerix -B recipients. Autoimmune Adverse Events Subjects were monitored for the occu rrence of new-onset potentially immune -mediated adverse events for 12 months after the first dose of vaccine. Events were adjudicated as to whether they were autoimmune by an external group of experts blinded to treatment assignment . As determined by the adjudicators, new-onset autoimmune adverse events were reported in 0.2% (n=3) of HEPLISAV -B recipients : two subjects with hypothyroidism and one subject with vitiligo . None of these events was considered related to vaccination by the expert group. No new -onset autoimmune adverse events were reported in the Engerix -B group. Although not referred to the external group of experts , one HEPLISAV -B recipient was determined to have Tolosa -Hunt syndrome which is presumed to have an immune -medi ated etiology . This event was not considered related to vaccination. Deaths One subject (0.05%) died of a pulmonary embolism in the HEPLISAV -B group and 1 subject (0.2%) died of heart failure in the Engerix -B group. Neither death was considered related to vaccination. Study 3 in Subjects 18 through 70 Years of Age Study 3 was a randomized, observer -blind, active -controlled, multicenter study in the United States in which 5587 subjects received at least 1 dose of HEPLISAV -B and 2781 subjects received at least 1 dose of Engerix -B. Enrolled subjects had no history of hepatitis B vaccination or infection. HEPLISAV -B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 month followed by saline placebo at 6 months. Engerix -B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months . In the total study population, the mean age was 50 years ; 51% were men ; 71% were white, 26% black, 1% , and had hypertension, 32% had dyslipidemia, and 14% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. These demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in both vaccine groups. Unsolicited Medically -Attended Adverse Events Subjects were monitored for unsolicited medically -attended adverse events, those for which a subject sought medical care, for 13 months after the first dose of vaccine. Overall, medically -attended adverse events were reported in 46.0% of HEPLISAV and 46.2% 0.3% of Engerix -B recipients. Unsolicited medically -attended adverse events within 28 days following any injection , including placebo , were reported by 20.1% of both HEPLISAV -B and Engerix -B recipients. Serious Adverse Events Subjects were monitored for serious adverse events for 13 months after the first dose of vaccine. The percentage of subjects who reported serious adverse events was 6.2% in the HEPLISAV -B group and 5.3% in the Engerix -B -B recipients . An analysis of serious adverse events likely representing myocardial infarction (MI) was conducted using the standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query (SMQ) for MI. This analysis identified a total of 19 HEPLISAV -B subjects (0.3%) and 3 E ngerix -B subjects (0.1%) with events included in the SMQ for MI (these events include the 15 reports of AMI). Additional evidence , including information on temporal relationship and baseline risk factors, does not su pport a causal relationship between HEPLISAV -B administration and AMI. Among the 19 events identified as MI in HEPLISAV -B recipients , three occurred within 14 days, nine occurred within 53-180 days, and seven occurred more than 180 days following any dose of HEPLISAV -B. Among the three events identified as MI in Engerix - B recipients, one each occurred 13, 115, and 203 days following any dose. All 19 HEPLISAV -B recipients and 3 Engerix -B recipients reported one or more baseline risk factors for cardiovascul ar disease. Autoi mmune Adverse Events Subjects were monitored for the occurrence of new-onset potentially immune -mediated adverse events for 13 months after the first dose of vaccine. Events were adjudicated as to whether they were autoimmune by an external group of experts who were blinded to treatment assignment . As determined by the adjudicators, new-onset autoimmune adverse events were reported in 0.1% thyroiditis (with concurrent diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma) ]. None of these events was considered to be related to vaccination by the external experts. No new -onset autoimmune adverse events were reported in the Engerix -B group. Deaths During the study death was reported in 25 subjects (0.4%) in the HEPLISAV -B group and 7 subjects (0.3%) in the Engerix -B group. No death was considered related to vaccination. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Use with Immune Globulin There are no data to assess the concomitant use of HEPLISAV -B with immune globulin. When concomitant administration of HEPLISAV -B and immune globulin is required, they should be given with different syringes at different injection sites. 7.2 Interference with Laboratory Tests Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) derived from hepatitis B vaccines has been transiently detected in blood samples following vaccination. Serum HBsAg detection may not have diagnostic value within 28 days after receipt of HEPLISAV -B. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to HEPLISAV -B during pregnancy. Women who receive HEPLISAV -B during pregnancy are encouraged to contact 1-844-443-7734. Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In clinically recognized pregnancies in the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20%. There are no clinical studies of HEPLISAV -B in pregnant women. Available human data on HEPLISAV - B administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy. In a developmental toxicity study, 0.3 mL of a vaccine formulation containing 2.5 mcg HBsAg and 3000 mcg cytosine phosphoguanine (CpG) 1018 adjuvant was administered to female rats prior to mating and during gestation. These animal studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to this vaccine formulation [see Data ]. Data Animal data Developmental toxicity studies were conducted in female rats. Animals were administered 0.3 mL of a vaccine formulation containing 2.5 mcg HBsAg and 3000 mcg CpG 1018 adjuvant twice prior to mating, and on gestation days 6 and 18 (a single human dose of HEPLISAV -B contains 20 mcg HBsAg and 3000 mcg CpG 1018 adjuvant). No adverse effects on pre-natal and post-natal development up to the time of weaning were observed. There were no vaccine -related fetal malformations or variations observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether HEPLISAV -B is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of HEPLISAV -B on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HEPLISAV -B and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HEPLISAV - B or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of HEPLISAV -B have not been established in individuals less than 18 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials included 909 adults 65 through 70 years of age who received HEPLISAV -B. Among subjects who received HEPLISAV -B, a seroprotective level of antibody to HBsAg was achieved in 90% of those 65 through 70 years of age compared to 96% of those aged 18 through 64 years of age. Safety and eff ectiveness of HEPLISAV -B in adults older than 70 years of age w ere extrapolated from findings in subjects younger than 70 years of age. 8.6 Adults on Hemodialysis Safety and effectiveness of HEPLISAV -B have not been established in adults on hemodialysis. 11 DESCRIPTION HEPLISAV -B [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant), Adjuvanted] is a sterile solution for intramuscular injection. The HBsAg is expressed in a recombinant strain of Hansenula polymorpha yeast. The fermentation process involves growth of the recombinant H. polymorpha on chemically -defined fermentation media containing vitamins and mineral salts. The HBsAg is expressed intra-cellularly in the yeast cells. It is released from the yeast cells by cell disruption and purified by a series of physicochemical steps. Each dose may contain residual amounts of yeast protein (5.0% of total protein ), yeast DNA (< 20 picogram), and deoxycholate (< 0.9 ppm) from the HBsAg manufacturing process . HEPLISAV -B is prepared by combining the purified HBsAg together with the CpG 1018 adjuvant, a 22-mer 80, 0.1 mg/mL). Each dose is formulated to contain 20 mcg of HBsAg and 3000 mcg of CpG 1018 adjuvant. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. HEPLISAV -B is formulated without preservatives. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Infection with hepatitis B virus can have serious consequences including acute massive hepatic necrosis and chronic active hepatitis. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antibody concentrations 10 mIU/mL against HBsAg are recognized as conferring protection against hepatitis B virus infection. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility HEPLISAV -B has not been evaluated for carcinogenicity, mutagenic potential or male infertility in animals. Vaccination of female rats with a vaccine formulation containing 2.5 mcg HBsAg and 3000 mcg CpG 1018 adjuvant had no effect on fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8)]. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Evaluation of Seroprotection The immunogenicity of HEPLISAV -B was evaluated in comparison with a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix -B) in 3 randomized, active controlled, observer -blinded, multi -center Phase 3 clinical trials of adults. HEPLISAV -B was given as a 2-dose regimen at 0 and 1 months followed by saline placebo at 6 months. Engerix -B was given at 0, 1, and 6 months . The trials compared the seroprotection rates (% with antibody concentration 10 mIU/mL) induced by HEPLISAV -B and Engerix -B. Noninferiority was met if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in seroprotection rates (HEPLISAV -B minus Engerix -B) was greater than -10%. Study 1: Seroprotection in Adults 18 through 55 Years of Age In Study 1, the immunogenicity population comprised 1511 participants who received HEPLISAV -B and 521 who received Engerix -B. The mean age was 40 years for both groups. The primary analysis compared the seroprotection rate at Week 12 for HEPLISAV -B with that at Week 28 for Engerix -B. Non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate induced by HEPLISAV -B compared to E ngerix -B was demonstrated (Table 3). Timepoint Table 3 Study 1: Seroprotection Rate of HEPLISAV -B and Engerix -B (ages N interval; N = number of subjects in the analysis population in the group; SPR = seroprotection rate (% with anti -HBs 10 mIU/mL). * Noninferiority was met because the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in SPRs was greater than -10%. Clinical trial number: NCT00435812 Study 2: Seroprotection in Adults 40 through 70 Years of Age In Study 2, the immunogenicity population comprised 1121 subjects who received HEPLISAV -B and 353 subjects who received Engerix -B. The mean age was 54 years for both groups. The primary analysis compared the seroprotection rate at Week 12 for HEPLISAV -B with that at Week 32 for Engerix -B. Non- inferiority of the seroprotection rate induced by HEPLISAV -B compared to E ngerix -B was demonstrated (Table 4). Timepoint Table 4 Study 2: Seroprotection Rate of HEPLISAV -B and Engerix -B (ages -B N = 1121 Engerix -B CI = confidence interval; N = number of subjects in the analysis population in the group; SPR = seroprotection rate (% with anti-HBs 10 mIU/mL). * Noninferiority was met because the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in SPRs was greater than -10%. The SPR following HEPLISAV -B was statistically significant ly higher than following Engerix -B (lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in SPRs was greater than 0%). Clinical trial number: NCT01005407 Study 3: Seroprotection in Adults 18 through 70 Years of Age Including those with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In Study 3, the immunogenicity population comprised 4537 subjects who received HEPLISAV -B and 2289 subjects who received Engerix -B. The mean age was 51 years and 14% of subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus ( defined as having a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and taking at least an oral or non - insulin injectable hypoglycemic agent and/or insulin ). The primary analysis compared the seroprotection rate at Week 28 for HEPLISAV -B (n= 640) with that at Week 28 for Engerix -B (n= 321) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate induced by HEPLISAV -B compared to E ngerix -B was demonstrated (Table 5). Timepoint Table 5 Study 3: Seroprotection Rate of HEPLISAV -B and Engerix -B (subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus ages 18 through 70 years) HEPLISAV -B N = 640 Engerix -B N (87.4, 92.2) 65.1% (59.6, 70.3) 24.9% (19.3, 30.7) * CI = confidence interval; N = number of subjects in the analysis population in the group; SPR = seroprotection rate (% with anti-HBs 10 mIU/mL). * Noninferiority was met because the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in SPRs was greater than -10%. The SPR following HEPLISAV -B was statistically significantly higher than following Engerix -B (lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in SPRs was greater than 0%). Clinical trial number: NCT02117934 A secondary analysis compared the seroprotection rate at Week 24 for HEPLISAV -B with that at Week 28 for Engerix -B in the total study population. Non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate induced by HEPLISAV -B compared to Engerix -B was demonstrated (Table 6).
