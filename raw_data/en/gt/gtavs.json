When necessary, the pH of each formula was adjusted with sodium hydroxide so that the pH of the reconstituted solution is within the USP specified range of 7 to 8. The chemical name for hydrocortisone sodium succinate is pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione,21-(3carboxy-1-oxopropoxy)-11,17-dihydroxy-, monosodium salt, (11)-and its molecular weight is 484.52. The structural formula is represented below: Hydrocortisone sodium succinate is a white or nearly white, odorless, hygroscopic amorphous solid. It is very soluble in water and in alcohol, very slightly soluble in acetone, and insoluble in chloroform. INDICATIONS When oral therapy is not feasible, and the strength, dosage form, and route of administration of the drug reasonably lend the preparation to the treatment of the condition, the intravenous or intramuscular use of SOLU-CORTEF Sterile Powder is indicated as follows: Allergic States Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal or cortisone is the drug of choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy, mineralocorticoid supplementation is of with cancer, nonsuppurative thyroiditis. Gastrointestinal Diseases To tide the patient over a critical period of the disease in regional enteritis (systemic therapy) and ulcerative colitis. Hematologic Disorders Acquired (autoimmune) administration is contraindicated), pure red cell aplasia, select cases of secondary thrombocytopenia. Miscellaneous Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement, tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy. Neoplastic Diseases For the palliative management of leukemias and lymphomas. Nervous System Cerebral edema associated with primary or metastatic brain tumor, or craniotomy. Ophthalmic Diseases Sympathetic ophthalmia, uveitis and ocular inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. Renal Diseases To induce diuresis or remission of proteinuria in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, or that due to lupus erythematosus. Respiratory Diseases Berylliosis, fulminating or disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy, idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias, symptomatic sarcoidosis. Rheumatic Disorders As adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in acute arthritis (selected cases may require low-dose maintenance therapy). For the treatment of dermatomyositis, temporal arteritis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Because of possible physical incompatibilities, SOLU-CORTEF should not be diluted or mixed with other solutions. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation. Therapy is initiated by administering SOLU-CORTEF Sterile Powder intravenously over a period of 30 seconds (e.g., 100 mg) to 10 minutes (e.g., 500 mg or more). In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized, usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours. When high dose hydrocortisone therapy must be continued beyond 48-72 hours, hypernatremia may occur. Under such circumstances, it may be desirable to replace SOLU-CORTEF with a corticoid such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate which causes little or no sodium retention. The initial dose of SOLU-CORTEF Sterile Powder is 100 mg to 500 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. This dose may be repeated at intervals of 2, 4, or 6 hours as indicated by the patient's response and clinical condition. It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations that may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In pediatric patients, the initial dose of hydrocortisone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.56 to 8 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (20 to 240 mg/m2 bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. Preparation Of Solutions 100 mg Plain For intravenous or intramuscular injection, prepare solution by aseptically adding not more than 2 mL of [Bacteriostatic](https://www.rxlist.com/bacteriostatic/definition.htm) Water for Injection or Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection to the contents of one vial. For intravenous infusion, first prepare solution by adding not more than 2 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection to the vial; this solution may then be added to 100 to 1000 mL of the following: 5% dextrose in water dextrose in isotonic saline solution if patient is not on sodium restriction). This product, like many other [steroid](https://www.rxlist.com/steroid/definition.htm) formulations, is sensitive to heat. Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial. Directions For Using The Act-O-Vial System - Press down on plastic activator to force diluent into the lower compartment. - Gently agitate to effect solution. - Remove plastic tab covering center of stopper. - Sterilize top of stopper with a suitable germicide. - Insert needle squarely through center of stopper until tip is just visible. [Invert](https://www.rxlist.com/invert/definition.htm)vial and withdraw dose. Further dilution is not necessary for intravenous or intramuscular injection. For intravenous infusion, first prepare solution as just described. The 100 mg solution may then be added to 100 to 1000 mL of 5% dextrose in water (or isotonic saline solution or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution if patient is not on sodium restriction). The 250 mg solution may be added to 250 to 1000 mL, the 500 mg solution may be added to 500 to 1000 mL, and the 1000 mg solution to 1000 mL of the same diluents. In cases where administration of a small volume of fluid is desirable, 100 mg to 3000 mg of SOLU-CORTEF may be added to 50 mL of the above diluents. The resulting solutions are stable for at least 4 hours and may be administered either directly or by IV piggyback. When reconstituted as directed, pH's of the solutions range from 7 to 8 and the tonicities are: 100 mg ACT-O-VIAL, 0.36 osmolar; 250 saline=0.28 osmolar.)

Revised: Sep 2020 SIDE EFFECTS The following adverse reactions have been reported with SOLU-CORTEF or other corticosteroids: Allergic reactions: Allergic or hypersensitivity arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, collapse, congestive heart failure, fat embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in premature infants, myocardial perineal area, after injection), healing, increased sweating, rash, sterile abscess, striae, suppressed reactions to skin tests, thin fragile skin, thinning scalp hair, urticaria. Endocrine: Decreased carbohydrate and glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid state, glycosuria, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetes, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, menstrual irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness (particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery, or illness), suppression of growth in pediatric patients. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, fluid retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, sodium retention. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention, bowel/bladder dysfunction (after intrathecal administration), elevation in serum liver enzyme levels (usually reversible upon discontinuation), hepatomegaly, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with possible perforation and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine (particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis. Metabolic: Negative nitrogen balance due to protein necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, Charcot-like arthropathy, loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra-articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, vertebral compression fractures. Neurologic/Psychiatric: Convulsions, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, headache, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually following discontinuation of treatment, insomnia, mood swings, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes, psychic disorders, vertigo. Arachnoiditis, meningitis, paraparesis/paraplegia, and sensory disturbances subcapsular cataracts, rare instances of blindness associated with periocular injections. Other: Abnormal fat deposits, decreased resistance to infection, hiccups, increased or decreased motility and number of spermatozoa, injection site infections following non-sterile administration (see [WARNINGS](/solu-cortef-drug.htm#W)), malaise, moon face, weight gain. DRUG INTERACTIONS Aminoglutethimide: Aminoglutethimide may lead to a loss of corticosteroid-induced adrenal suppression. Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents: When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure. Antibiotics: Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (see DRUG INTERACTIONS, Hepatic Enzyme Inhibitors). Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Anticoagulants, oral: Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetics: Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required. Antitubercular drugs: Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased. Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids. Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use. Digitalis glycosides: Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia. Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, activity may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Hepatic Enzyme Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics troleandomycin): Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole has been reported to significantly decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids. Skin tests: Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests. Vaccines: Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see [WARNINGS](/solu-cortef-drug.htm#W): Infections, Vaccination). WARNINGS Serious Neurologic Adverse Reactions With Epidural Administration Serious neurologic events, some resulting in death, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids. Specific events reported include, but are not limited to, spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, and stroke. These serious neurologic events have been reported with and without use of fluoroscopy. The safety and effectiveness of epidural administration of corticosteroids have not been established, and corticosteroids are not approved for this use. General Injection of SOLU-CORTEF may result in dermal and/or subdermal changes forming depressions in the skin at the injection site. In order to minimize the incidence of dermal and subdermal atrophy, care must be exercised not to exceed recommended doses in injections. Injection into the deltoid muscle should be avoided because of a high incidence of subcutaneous atrophy. Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Results from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, an IV corticosteroid, showed an increase in early (at 2 weeks) and late (at 6 months) mortality in patients with cranial trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment. High doses of systemic corticosteroids, including SOLU-CORTEF, should not be used for the treatment of traumatic brain injury. Cardio-Renal Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Endocrine Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperglycemia. Monitor patients for these conditions with chronic use. Corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Drug induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Infections General Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Do not use intra-articularly, intrabursally, or for intratendinous administration for local effect in the presence of acute local infection. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and [congestive heart failure](https://www.rxlist.com/congestive_heart_failure/definition.htm) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS, Amphotericin B Injection And Potassium-Depleting Agents). Special Pathogens [Latent](https://www.rxlist.com/latent/definition.htm) disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, and that latent [amebiasis](https://www.rxlist.com/amebiasis/definition.htm) or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating [corticosteroid](https://www.rxlist.com/corticosteroid/definition.htm) therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or in any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced [immunosuppression](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppression/definition.htm) may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal [gram](https://www.rxlist.com/gram_measure/definition.htm)-negative [septicemia](https://www.rxlist.com/septicemia/definition.htm). Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral [malaria](https://www.rxlist.com/malaria/definition.htm). There is currently no evidence of benefit from steroids in this condition. Tuberculosis The use of corticosteroids in [active tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/active_tuberculosis/definition.htm) should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated [tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculosis/definition.htm) in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or [tuberculin](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculin/definition.htm) reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive [chemoprophylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/chemoprophylaxis/definition.htm). Vaccination Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. [Immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/immunization/definition.htm) procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy (e.g., for Addison's disease). Viral Infections [Chicken pox](https://www.rxlist.com/chicken_pox/definition.htm) and [measles](https://www.rxlist.com/measles/definition.htm) can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is not known. If exposed to chicken pox, [prophylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/prophylaxis/definition.htm) with [varicella](https://www.rxlist.com/varicella_chickenpox/definition.htm) zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be exposed to measles, prophylaxis with [immunoglobulin](https://www.rxlist.com/immunoglobulin/definition.htm) ( [IG](https://www.rxlist.com/ig/definition.htm)) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with [antiviral](https://www.rxlist.com/antiviral/definition.htm) agents should be considered. Neurologic Reports of severe medical events have been associated with the intrathecal route of administration (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Neurologic/Psychiatric). Ophthalmic Use of corticosteroids may produce [posterior](https://www.rxlist.com/posterior/definition.htm) subcapsular cataracts, [glaucoma](https://www.rxlist.com/glaucoma/definition.htm) with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary [ocular](https://www.rxlist.com/ocular/definition.htm) infections due to bacteria, fungi, or [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viruses/definition.htm). The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular [herpes](https://www.rxlist.com/herpes/definition.htm) simplex because of corneal perforation. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex. PRECAUTIONS General The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposi's [sarcoma](https://www.rxlist.com/sarcoma/definition.htm) has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. Cardio-Renal As sodium retention with resultant edema and [potassium](https://www.rxlist.com/potassium/supplements.htm) loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive [heart failure](https://www.rxlist.com/heart_failure/definition.htm), [hypertension](https://www.rxlist.com/hypertension/definition.htm), or renal insufficiency. Endocrine Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of [stress](https://www.rxlist.com/stress/definition.htm) occurring during that period, [hormone therapy](https://www.rxlist.com/hormone_therapy_ht/definition.htm) should be reinstituted. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in [hyperthyroid](https://www.rxlist.com/hyperthyroid/definition.htm) patients. Changes in [thyroid](https://www.rxlist.com/thyroid/definition.htm) status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. Gastrointestinal Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, [diverticulitis](https://www.rxlist.com/diverticulitis/definition.htm), fresh intestinal anastomoses, and non-specific [ulcerative colitis](https://www.rxlist.com/ulcerative_colitis/definition.htm), since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of [peritoneal](https://www.rxlist.com/peritoneal/definition.htm) irritation following [gastrointestinal](https://www.rxlist.com/gastrointestinal/definition.htm) perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased [metabolism](https://www.rxlist.com/metabolism/definition.htm) of corticosteroids in patients with [cirrhosis](https://www.rxlist.com/cirrhosis/definition.htm). Musculoskeletal Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone [resorption](https://www.rxlist.com/resorption/definition.htm) both through their effect on calcium regulation (e.g., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of [osteoblast](https://www.rxlist.com/osteoblast/definition.htm) function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein [catabolism](https://www.rxlist.com/catabolism/definition.htm), and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of [osteoporosis](https://www.rxlist.com/osteoporosis/definition.htm) at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (i.e., [postmenopausal](https://www.rxlist.com/postmenopausal/definition.htm) women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Local injection of a steroid into a previously infected site is not usually recommended. Neurologic-Psychiatric An acute [myopathy](https://www.rxlist.com/myopathy/definition.htm) has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of [neuromuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/neuromuscular/definition.htm) transmission (e.g., [myasthenia gravis](https://www.rxlist.com/myasthenia_gravis/definition.htm)), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in [quadriparesis](https://www.rxlist.com/quadriparesis/definition.htm). Elevation of [creatine](https://www.rxlist.com/creatine/supplements.htm) kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from [euphoria](https://www.rxlist.com/euphoria/definition.htm), insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Ophthalmic [Intraocular pressure](https://www.rxlist.com/intraocular_pressure/definition.htm) may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, [intraocular](https://www.rxlist.com/intraocular/definition.htm) pressure should be monitored. Other [Pheochromocytoma](https://www.rxlist.com/pheochromocytoma/definition.htm) crisis, which can be fatal, has been reported after administration of systemic corticosteroids. In patients with suspected pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or [mutagenesis](https://www.rxlist.com/mutagenesis/definition.htm). Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients. Corticosteroids have been shown to impair fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Corticosteroids have been shown to be [teratogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/teratogenic/definition.htm) in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of [cleft palate](https://www.rxlist.com/cleft_palate/definition.htm) in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with [endogenous](https://www.rxlist.com/endogenous/definition.htm) corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made whether to continue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (>2 years of age) and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (>1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids (e.g., severe [asthma](https://www.rxlist.com/asthma/definition.htm) and [wheezing](https://www.rxlist.com/wheezing/definition.htm)) are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their [pathophysiology](https://www.rxlist.com/pathophysiology/definition.htm) are considered to be substantially similar in both populations. The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, [thromboembolism](https://www.rxlist.com/thromboembolism/definition.htm), peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA [axis](https://www.rxlist.com/axis/definition.htm) suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal [cortisol](https://www.rxlist.com/cortisol/definition.htm) plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest [effective dose](https://www.rxlist.com/effective_dose/definition.htm). [Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy](https://www.rxlist.com/hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy/definition.htm) was reported after administration of hydrocortisone to prematurely born infants, therefore appropriate diagnostic evaluation and monitoring of cardiac function and structure should be performed. Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. OVERDOSE Treatment of acute overdosage is by supportive and symptomatic therapy. For chronic overdosage in the face of severe disease requiring continuous steroid therapy, the dosage of the corticosteroid may be reduced only temporarily, or alternate day treatment may be introduced. CONTRAINDICATIONS SOLU-CORTEF Sterile Powder is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections and patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents. Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for Powder is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. Reports of severe medical events have been associated with this route of administration. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://www.rxlist.com/gastrointestinal_tract/definition.htm). Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and [cortisone](https://www.rxlist.com/cortisone/definition.htm)), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Hydrocortisone sodium succinate has the same metabolic and anti-inflammatory actions as hydrocortisone. When given parenterally and in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are equivalent in biologic activity. The highly water-soluble sodium succinate ester of hydrocortisone permits the immediate intravenous administration of high doses of hydrocortisone in a small volume of diluent and is particularly useful where high blood levels of hydrocortisone are required rapidly. Following the intravenous injection of hydrocortisone sodium succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly complete within 12 hours. Thus, if constantly high blood levels are required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation is also rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and is excreted in a pattern similar to that observed after intravenous injection. Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm) to diverse stimuli. PATIENT INFORMATION Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids, and to seek medical advice at once should they develop fever or other signs of infection. Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.
