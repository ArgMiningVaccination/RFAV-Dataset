We highlight some important state regulations in place for Indiana skilled nursing, assisted living, and memory care facilities below. Skilled nursing facilities Skilled nursing facilities are also referred to as comprehensive care facilities in Indiana. Skilled nursing facilities are required to be licensed through the Comprehensive Care Facility Licensing and Certification Program by the Indiana Department of Health. Skilled nursing facilities are required to provide the following: - Room and board - Food for special diets - Medication administration - Rehabilitative treatments and therapies under the order of a physician - Comprehensive nursing care Read on to find out about types of care provided in a skilled nursing facility, as well as some specific regulations for skilled nursing facilities. Types of care in a skilled nursing facility Skilled nursing facilities are licensed to provide comprehensive nursing care, which goes beyond what's provided in settings like assisted living or memory care facilities. Comprehensive nursing care includes the following types of medical care services: - Insertion, irrigation, and replacement of catheters - Treatment of complex or infected wounds that require the use of sterile techniques - Treatment of widespread skin disorders, such as pressure ulcers - Any physician-ordered treatments that require a nurse's observation - Administration of oxygen or other medical gases Skilled nursing facility regulations in Indiana Indiana's regulations for skilled nursing facilities help make sure facilities provide a safe and sanitary environment that promotes residents' quality of life and dignity. We highlight a few of those regulations for skilled nursing facilities below: - Prospective residents must have a physician's order to be admitted. - All residents must be served three daily meals and, if needed, be provided with special eating equipment and utensils. - Facilities must conduct a preadmission evaluation on prospective residents to make sure their needs can be met at the facility. - Facilities must develop a comprehensive care plan within seven days after a resident's initial assessment. The plan must include measurable goals and timelines to meet a resident's specific care needs. - Facilities must provide residents a discharge summary that details their health status at the time of transfer, as well as a post-discharge plan to identify their needs after transfer. - Facilities must provide an ongoing activity program with a range of options, such as group social activities, events, arts and crafts, and spiritual programs. - Residents have the right to be treated with dignity and free from all forms of abuse. All facilities must have policies in place that prohibit abuse, mistreatment, and neglect of residents. - Facilities must provide specialized rehabilitative therapies (physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc.) or use an outside resource to provide such therapies for residents who need them. Indiana assisted living and memory care regulations Assisted living facilities in Indiana can be licensed or unlicensed to operate. Both types of facilities should provide assistance with activities of daily living to individuals. We outline some distinctions between both types of facilities, as well as Indiana regulations for licensed assisted living facilities below. Licensed vs. unlicensed assisted living facilities Assisted living facilities can be either licensed or unlicensed in Indiana. Assisted living facilities that are licensed fall under the category of residential care facilities and are regulated and inspected by the Indiana Department of Health about every nine to 15 months. Licensed assisted living facilities can provide more advanced health care services like medication administration. Unlicensed assisted living facilities, on the other hand, can't provide medication administration. However, residents can hire their own home health care caregivers if they need such services while living in a facility. Assisted living vs. skilled nursing facilities Unlike skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities \u2014 both licensed and unlicensed \u2014 can't provide comprehensive nursing services or admit residents who need round-the-clock nursing care. They also can't admit seniors who require total assistance with all their activities of daily living. We outline some more key regulations in place for licensed Indiana assisted living facilities below. Indiana regulations for licensed assisted living facilities Any medication administration needs to be ordered by a resident's doctor and supervised by a licensed nurse, though residents may self-administer or receive medication assistance from staff when appropriate and safe.

Regulations for licensed assisted living facilities with memory care Licensed assisted living facilities that offer memory care are required to submit an [Alzheimer's and dementia special care unit form](https://forms.in.gov/download.aspx?id=5535).
