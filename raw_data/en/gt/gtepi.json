The underlying principles of naturopathy are the importance of a healthy diet, clean fresh water, sunlight, exercise and stress management. - Naturopathy aims to educate the person to look after their own health and the health of their family, minimising symptoms of any illness, supporting the body's capacity to heal, and balancing the body so that illness is less likely to occur in the future.A range of therapies are used to support the person. Therapies may include nutritional medicine, diet advice, herbal medicine, homeopathy, lifestyle advice, and tactile therapies, such as massage, acupressure or Bowen technique. - Naturopathy uses a series of principles and beliefs to create individual treatment plans. These principles and beliefs are: - Self-healing: Identifying and removing obstacles to recovery, allows for natural healing. - Underlying symptoms: Rather than stopping symptoms, a naturopathic doctor can resolve underlying physical or mental issues by treating the body, mind, and spirit. - Harmless treatment: Treatment plans should not have harmful side effects or control symptoms negatively. - Holistic treatment: A naturopathic doctor must recognize individuality to treat all aspects of a person's health effectively. - Education in treatment: Naturopathic doctors teach self-care to help empower people against ill health. - Prevention: It is good to remove toxic substances from a lifestyle to prevent problems from arising. On the flip side, Ayurveda treatment starts with an internal purification process, followed by a special diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation. The concepts of universal interconnectedness, the body's constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas) are the primary basis of ayurvedic medicine.. The main focus of Ayurveda is more on creating energetic levels at the inner level. Ayurveda believes that there should be harmony between body, mind, and soul. Ayurveda names three elemental substances known as doshas: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata. If any of these doshas get imbalanced, it results in disease. The treatment of diseases in Ayurveda is in the form of modalities like a mantra, pranayama, asana, yoga, meditation, and intake of proper Ayurvedic Therapy. Moreover, it is vital to avoid such substances or behaviors that can aggravate dosha out of balance.
