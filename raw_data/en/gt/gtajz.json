Although such an approach seems desirable, it is precisely this aspect that opens the door to spiritual views incompatible with Christianity. Many forms of alternative medicine speak of a divine essence we allegedly possess, of a vital force that we can manipulate, of spiritual beings that can help us, and other such views closely related to Eastern religions and New Age thought. In their desire to find healing at any price, Christians often resort to these methods without realizing the spiritual danger involved. For Christians who want to live consistently with their faith, this book is intended to raise awareness of the hidden beliefs of alternative medicine. \"Ernest Valea gives an in-depth exploration of alternative medicine and its philosophical underpinnings. Christians must ask themselves if they can reconcile these teachings with their Christian faith. I am impressed by the broad research background of this book and am fully supportive of its theological and practical conclusions.\" --Dr. Samuel Pfeifer, former director of a Christian clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy in Switzerland, author of Healing At Any Price? \"Dr. Valea provides a clear and concise exposition of the often disguised or hidden spiritual foundations of several of the best-known forms of alternative medicine and then reveals how many of these are not reconcilable with orthodox Christian beliefs. Christians interested in alternative medicine systems--including those practiced in some churches--may find this information revelatory or even shocking. Pastoral professionals should carefully consider this critical information to share with their flocks.\" --Dr. Walt Larimore, nationally-recognized family physician educator, best-selling author of 32 books, and award-winning medical journalist \"Informative and insightful. An essential guide to the philosophies underlying the most important forms of alternative medicine in the world today. (Dr. Valea gives an authoritative and closely researched assessment of each therapy from the perspective of the major Christian faith traditions.) An invaluable resource for patients, healthcare practitioners, and everyone who seeks to understand the origins, beliefs, and spiritual practices which underpin alternative therapies.\" --John Wyatt, University College London "}
