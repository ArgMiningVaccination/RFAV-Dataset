Data Summary CARM has received 25 reports of liver toxicity associated with the use of products containing Artemisia annua extract, up until 30 September 2018 (Table 1). All of the reports identified Arthrem as the medicine suspected of causing the liver reaction. GO Arthri-Remedy 1-A-Day was co-suspected in two of the 25 reports. The number of reports received by CARM suggests that the risk of liver toxicity associated with the use of this product is approximately 0.5 to 6.3 cases per 10 000 consumers. The pattern of liver toxicity reported in the cases varied. A hepatocellular pattern was reported in 6 cases, a cholestatic pattern in 7 cases, and a mixed pattern in 3 cases. One case of hepatic cirrhosis was also reported. No information on the pattern of liver toxicity was available for the remaining 8 cases. All of the patients stopped taking the product containing Artemisia annua extract when signs of liver toxicity developed. At the time the information was reported to CARM, most patients had already recovered from the hepatotoxicity, or were improving. Arthrem has been studied in a 12-week pilot study [1](#reference) . During the study, one of 14 patients who took Arthrem 300 mg twice per day developed hepatitis, which was considered by the study investigators to be possibly related to Arthrem. What actions are Medsafe taking? Medsafe will continue to monitor the safety of Arthrem.
