Acupuncture works to balance meridians and organ systems. It is based on the idea of restoring qi and blood flow. Your acupuncturist will do a full health history work up on you to find what is out of balance and work to rectify the said imbalance. Any imbalance or disruption of qi or blood flow can cause issues that could ultimately result in cell death, which can manifest as wrinkles (among other things). Of course, the best way to limit wrinkles is to drink plenty of water daily, avoid caffeine, sugar, fried, fatty foods and limit sun exposure and wear sunscreen. Getting good quality restorative sleep and avoiding stress as much as possible is also very important. If none of these boxes are checked for you, than all of the acupuncture in the world is not going to make a difference in your skin. A lot of people I have come across have assumed that if they don't see a change immediately from acupuncture than it doesn't work. Chinese medicine works by getting to the root of the problem, which takes time, weeks, even months sometimes. If you are expecting astounding results for wrinkles but are doing nothing to take care of your skin then you will be disappointed. Acupuncture should be used as a complement to your health care routine, not a substitute for it. All of this being said, with age comes wrinkles and to an extent, there's not a lot you can do about it. But you can affect how quickly you get them or how many. I, myself, do not practice facial acupuncture, but you may want to talk to a practitioner that does and you may get a different response to your questions. Good luck but more importantly, good health!!! [Mrs. Lianghui Peng](/Expert/3593526-Lianghui-Peng)Acupuncturist Houston, TX Acupuncture can help skin disorders.

[Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist My mother did cosmetic facial acupuncture for a couple years. She swore it made a difference, but I failed to see a substantial interest. But that could have been my skepticism and seeing her every day so I didn't notice the change. By skin problems, I think you mean wrinkles, so I am commenting on that.

[Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO There is a sub-speciality in acupuncture known as \"cosmetic acupuncture\". These folks receive special training on facial anatomy and generally get very good results with wrinkles and fine lines, so, yes, acupuncture can probably help with your issue. I'm not trained in nor do I practice cosmetic acupuncture. Your best bet would be to go to the \"Find a Practitioner\" link at NCCAOM.org, get a list of local providers and check out their web-sites or call them to see if they work with cosmetic acupuncture.
