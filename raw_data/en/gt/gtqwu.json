It works by stimulating scalp and hair root circulation and can be used to grow longer hair, prevent baldness or stimulate new hair growth in balding areas. A 2015 study published in SKINmed Journal compared rosemary oil to minoxidil, a popular hair regrowth treatment. According to the study, rosemary oil performed as well as minoxidil, but with less scalp itching as a side effect. A clinical review study also showed Rosemary essential oil has been found to increase the growth of new hair by 22 percent when massaged onto the scalp. Studies published in Europe PMC (*12) in 2018 have proven the oil from the Rosemary plant improves both hair thickness and hair growth, based on its ability to improve cellular generation by boosting circulation and increasing blood flow. Carnosic acid, one of the plant's key ingredients, has shown to heal nerve damage and restore tissue. Further studies have shown rosemary helps hair follicles thrive if they're being cut off from their blood supply by delivering valuable nutrients and oxygen. A 2017 study published by the NIH *(13) found that rosemary essential oil was a most effective opponent for combating fungi and bacteria infections, which had caused hair loss from an unhealthy scalp. Further, it was most effective for hair restoration when used consistently for1 to 2 times a week for 6 months. As aromatherapy, inhaling compounds in rosemary oil have been shown to reduce anxiety, boost mood, and improve concentration and memory. "}
