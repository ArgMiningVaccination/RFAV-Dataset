Whilst there are effective pharmaceutical treatment options, women with PCOS have expressed a strong desire for alternatives. This study investigates the use and attitudes of women with PCOS towards complementary medicine (CM). Methods: Women as members of PCOS support groups responded to an anonymous on-line survey which examined rates and patterns of use for CM 's, areas of health for use, perceptions of effectiveness, safety and demographic features. Data collection targeted women with PCOS using two consumer support groups. The first group self-selected following direct email to members of a land based consumer support group, the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association of Australia (POSAA). The second sample was generated through the electronic social network Facebook, using a snowball technique. Two surveys, identical in content, were collected by cloud based Survey Monkey. Data were described and associations between the variables, 'reasons for use 'and 'perceptions of effectiveness 'were explored. Non-response bias was assessed using a continuum of resistance model. Results: 493 women participated in the study; 91.1% response rate from the POSAA group. Over 70% reported use of complementary medicine, usually nutritional and herbal supplements and 76.6% of CM users reported consultation with a complementary practitioner. Many participants were using CM to treat PCOS however most were using it to concurrently treat a range of health conditions, describing women 's desire for more than single symptom management. Disadvantages for CM use were cited by 71% of respondents. Women using complementary medicine with specific treatment goals in mind reported greater self-perceived effectiveness, suggesting that informed use may improve women 's satisfaction with CM. Adverse reactions were reported by 12.2% of women and the need for further research into adverse reactions for CM 's was identified. Demographic and PCOS characteristics were similar to clinical populations of PCOS and non-response bias was shown as not significant. Conclusion: This study describes the prevalence of use for complementary medicine by women with PCOS as over 70% and adds to our understanding of women 's experiences with CM and their motivations for use of CM. Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endo- crine disorder affecting up to one in five reproductive aged women [1]. PCOS is a life-long condition associ- ated with significant endocrine, reproductive and psy- chological morbidity and serious long term health risks [2-4]. The exact cause is unknown however it is believedto result from multiple interactions between genes, the in utero environment and lifestyle behaviors [4]. Current treatments are only moderately effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications [2] and women with PCOS have expressed strong dissatisfaction towards pharmaceutical therapies. In a survey of women with PCOS (n = 657), 99% indicated they would prefer to use effective and safe alternative treatments to birth control pills and fertility drugs for the management of their symptoms [5].* Correspondence: s.arentz@uws.edu.au 1National Institute of Complementary Medicine (NICM), University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2014 Arentz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:472 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/472Women 's preferences for complementary treatments coincide with the increasing prevalence for complemen- tary medicine (CM) use. In a critical review of 14 stud-ies, the prevalence of CM use by pregnant women was shown to range up to 87% [6]. Other studies have dem- onstrated similar rates of CM use by women attendingfamily planning clinics [7] and by menopausal women [8]. The landmark Australian Women 's Health longitudinal study of 11,454 women highlighted that nearly one thirdof middle aged women had consulted a complementary practitioner (chiropractor, naturopath, acupuncturist or herbalist) within the previous twelve months [9]. To date there have been no investigations into the use of CM by women with PCOS. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of use, the views and patterns ofCM use including women 's attitudes, views of CM ef- fectiveness and self-reported adverse events from CM. Method Study participants completed an on-line, web-based ques- tionnaire which examined demographic features, patternsof complementary medicine (CM) use, use of CM relating to symptoms of PCOS, perceptions of effectiveness and safety, sources of information on CM and concurrent useof CM with western medicine. Women with PCOS were recruited through two ap- proaches; (i) convenience sam pling of women belonging to the support/advocacy grou p Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association of Australia (POSAA) and (ii) a snowballing technique and response to an invitation posted on the so-cial network site Facebook with a link to the 'University Re- search for PCOS 'Facebook group. Self-referrals were received from the following Facebook groups based in twometropolitan areas in Sydney and New South Wales; members); PCOS TTC (333 members); Talk (2011 members). This study was approved bythe Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Western Sydney (EC00314) reference H9341. The research instrument We defined CM from an adaptation of the Cochrane Collaboration operational definition [10]. Specifically,our definition for CM was 'alternative or natural therap- ies or medicines including taking dietary supplements (herbal, vitamins, minerals and/or food supplements, forexample fish oils or barley greens) and or consulting traditional, alternative and complementary practitioners '. Participants were informed about specific types of CMsat the beginning of relevant questions with an extensive list of options and an open question for 'others 'at the end. Two prevalence questions included the option 'prescribed by a doctor 'to identify mainstream use rather than com- plementary medicine use. A six point Likert scale ranging from 'daily 'to 'as required 'enabled participants to reporttheir frequency of use. Participants were asked their reasons for using complementary medic ine and could indicate their response to fourteen symptom options. Responses were notlimited to one option. Questions about signs and symptoms of PCOS and current management preceded CM use and demographic characteristics. (Additional file 1. The surveyinstrument.) The research tool was tested on a pilot sample of eight women including four with PCOS. Survey administration The questionnaire was administered using Survey Monkey [11]. An email containing a letter of invitation and an elec-tronic link to the questionnaire was sent to all members of POSAA in November 2011. Two reminders were sent out at six-week intervals. The second approach used to dis-tribute the questionnaire to the community utilized a Facebook group created by the researcher (SA) in February 2012. Facebook groups are virtual communities of choice,linking people with shared interests, attributes or causes. Wall postings occurred bi -monthly during the study administration. Data analyses Analysis was undertaken using the statistical package,SPSS version 21.0 [12]. Categorical responses were re- ported as numbers and percentages with 95% confi- dence intervals. Relationships between variables wereexplored using Pearson 's correlation (two tail) for nor- mally distributed data (use of CM) and Spearman 'sR h o correlations or Gamma co-efficient for non-parametricmeasurements (type of CM practitioner). Logistic re- gression was used to predict whether or not perceptions of effectiveness (dependent variables) were associatedwith reasons for use (covariates). A value of 0.05 was considered statistically sign ificant with 95% confidence intervals. Non-response bias was assessed using the continuum of resistance model; this involves late responders viewed by proxy as non-responders due to similar characteristics[13]. This method of assessment was chosen due to the higher likelihood for early response by women who found the topic salient or interesting [14]. Responses to the sur-vey four months after the final reminder were classified as late responders and compared for difference with early re- sponses to assess the impact of non-response bias. Results Response rate Four hundred and ninety three (493) women with PCOS responded to the survey. A response was received from 235 invited members of the consumer support groupPOSAA (response rate of 91.1%). An additional 311 women who responded to the survey used the University Research Facebook group.Arentz et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:472 Page 2 of 6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/472The majority of participants were aged between 25 and 34 years, born in Australia, attained tertiary qualifi- cations, were employed and held private health insur-ance (Table 1). Women reported multiple symptoms of PCOS. The most common and infertility (53%, \u00b14.49, 95% CI). The respondents used various medical therapies to manage their symptoms. Over 65% (\u00b14.21, 95% CI) had used the oral contraceptive pill; 62.7% (\u00b14.26, 95% CI) had used other in-duction, hypoglycaemic and anti-androgen drugs. Medi- cations used to stimulate ovaries for IVF were reported by 11.8% (\u00b12.87, 95% CI). Use of complementary medicines and therapies Three hundred and four, out of 432 women (70.4%\u00b14.30 95% CI) reported using complementary medicine (CM) in the previous 12 months. Women were asked about their intake habits (Table 2). The most commonly used CM products taken on a daily basis were dietary supplements including vitamins, min- erals and food nutrients such as fish oil capsules, andherbal supplements. Two hundred and seven of 432 re- spondents (47.9% \u00b14.71 95% CI) reported use of more than one type of CM product. Complementary practitioner visits Consultations with acupuncturists, chiropractors, natu-ropaths, and massage therapists in the previous twelve months were reported by 233 of 304 CM users (76.6% \u00b1 4.76 95% CI) (Table 3) . A smaller number of womenalso consulted medical doctors for acupuncture treatment or integrative medicine which was provided within the general medical setting. Nearly half of respondents usingCM consulted multiple CM practitioners during the previ- ous twelve months, usually an acupuncturist and naturo- path (n = 47, 15.5% \u00b14.07 95% CI) or an acupuncturist andchiropractor (n = 41, 13.5% \u00b13.84 95% CI). Reasons for using Complementary Medicine (CM) Many women were using CM to treat PCOS (n = 199, 65.5%, \u00b1 5.34, 95% CI) however the majority of partici- pants reported using CM to assist with improving morethan one aspect of their health (n = 277, 76.7%, \u00b1 4.75, 95% CI). The most common reasons for use were to im- prove general wellbeing (n = 135, 44.4% \u00b1 5.59 95% CI);and to treat 102, 33.6%, \u00b1 5.31, 95% CI), and treat 92, 30.3% \u00b1 5.17 95% CI).Views about CM Twenty seven percent of CM users (n = 82, \u00b1 5.99, 95% CI)indicated they thought CM used alone was effective man-agement for PCOS and 24.7% (n = 75, \u00b14.85, 95% CI) re- ported that CM was effective for PCOS in conjunction with diet and exercise. Participant 's indicated they thought CM was effective for treating more than one condition,Table 1 Demographic characteristics of respondents N = 493 % 95% CI Age 17 or less 3 0.7 \u00b1 0.7918-24 72 17.0 \u00b1 EducationCompleted high School Yes 371 87.5 \u00b1 3.15 Missing data 69 Completed tertiary educationYes 323 76.2 \u00b1 4.05Missing data 69 Qualification from TAFE 20.9 \u00b1 3.59Private institution Diploma 70 14.2 \u00b1 3.08University degree 221 44.8 \u00b1 4.39Missing 121 7.7 \u00b1 2.35Student 16.2 Employed 39.4 \u00b1 4.31 Othe r 12 2.4 \u00b1 1.35 Missing data 68 Private Health Insurance Yes 275 65 \u00b1 4.55Missing data 70 Missing data for age, complete high school, te rtiary education, ethnicity, employment and health insurance was 14.0%.

A smaller number of women considered CM was effective for infertility (n = 33, 10.9% \u00b1 3.5 95% CI). Significant relationships were found between using CM to treat specific conditions and perceptions of effect- iveness. Use of CM to treat PCOS (n = 199), was associatedwith effectiveness of CM by 40.8% (PCC 4.64, p = 0.001) of participants. Use of CM as treatment for infertility (n = 102) was associated with effectiveness by 32.4% (PCC3.84, p = 0.001) of women and the treatment goal, 'to improve wellbeing '(n = 134), was associated with 71.6% (PCC 4.04, p = 0.001) of women reporting effectiveness. Predictions were found for using CM to treat PCOS and perceptions of effectiveness for PCOS (odds ratio (OR) 24.8, CI 11.1-55.3, p = 0.0001); infertility, (OR 18.8,CI 7.9-44.8, p = 0.0001) and for improved wellbeing (OR 8.8, CI 5.2-14.9, p = 0.0001).Advantages for CM were reported by 52.5% (n = 259, \u00b1 4.41, 95% CI). These included perceived naturalness of CM = 157, 60.6% \u00b1 5.95, 95% CI), the complementarynature of 46.3% \u00b1 6.07, 95% CI), per- ceived low risk effects (n = 104, 40.2%, \u00b1 5.97, 95% CI), increased self- responsibility (n = 81, 31.3%, \u00b1 5.65,95% CI) and the holistic nature of CM (n = 75, 29%, \u00b1 5.52 95% CI). Disadvantages associated with CM use were cited by 354 women (71.8%, \u00b1 3.97 95% CI). These included CM being too expensive (n = 187, 52.8% \u00b1 5.2, 95% CI), lack of research into CM (n = 175, 49.4% \u00b1 5.21 95% CI) and163 women (46.0% \u00b1 5.19, 95%CI) were not confident about a benefit from CM. A small number of women (13.6%, \u00b1 3.57, 95% CI) indicated they were not confidentto use CM in conjunction with other pharmaceuticals. Adverse reactions and CM Participants were asked about any adverse reactions or negative experiences with their use of CM. Adverse reac- tions to nutritional and herbal supplements, TraditionalChinese Herbal Medicine (TCHM) and acupuncture were reported by thirty seven CM users (12.2%, \u00b13.68, 95% CI). Nine reactions were to vitamins, seven to fish oil supple-ments, six to TCM including two to acupuncture, two to herbal teas and five to vitamin supplements prescribed by a medical practitioner. Eleven adverse reactions were re-ported including longer menstrual cycles, changes to bowel habits, sleep disturbances and headaches. Assessment for non-response bias and selection bias When testing for non-respon se bias for early and late re- sponders no significant differences were noted in the demo-graphic characteristics, symptoms of PCOS and prevalence for use of CM between any of the surveyed groups. Discussion The use of complementary medicine by women has in- creased in recent years. We present the first survey ofwomen with PCOS and report high use of CM, with nearly three out of four women reporting use and nearly half reporting use of multiple CM 's.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:472 Page 4 of 6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/472that women seek more than the management of symptoms associated with PCOS when using CM 's and that well- being, reproductive and mental health are important as-pects of care. Our findings are limited by the sampling framework and the referral of participants through support groups, since women with PCOS whom have not soughtsupport through POSAA or electronic social media, or women with PCOS in the community who have not been diagnosed [1] were not represented in this study. We found women have similar preferences for the types of CM use to those reported in reproductive health settings where nutritional and herbal supplements werethe most commonly reported CM (comparatively, 56% for women attending family planning clinics and 78% of women attending fertility clinics) [7,15]. However, ourfindings differ to studies showing recently increased preferences for acupuncture compared to naturopaths [7,16]. These differences may be explained by our studyfocusing only on women with PCOS, the definition of CM modalities used or influenced by recent statutory registration of acupuncture practitioners in Australia. Most women perceived the effectiveness of CM as at least somewhat helpful. This aligns with findings from other surveys of women attending family planning clinics[7], pregnant women [17] and middle aged women [8]. Our data show women 's perceptions of effectiveness were increased when they used CM with specific treatmentgoals in mind. Little is known about how women with PCOS acquire information and make decisions regarding suitable CM 's. This extended beyond the scope of our study however our findings demonstrate the value of in- formed CM treatment decisions and highlight the decision process for CM as an area of future research need. Themain disadvantage for CM cited in this study was the lack of research which reiterates women 's need for unbiased in- formation to support their CM decisions. Our data corresponds with findings reporting women have reduced recognition for potential hazards for CM [7,18,19]. Some herbal medicines taken in conjunctionwith pharmaceuticals may have adverse effects. Hypericum perforatum (St Johns wort) for example, has been shown to reduce pharmaceutical effectiveness [20-22]. Import- antly, our findings report participant 's high use for herbal medicines and high use of pharmaceuticals including theoral contraceptive pill (over 65%). Future research is needed to examine concurrent use of pharmaceuticals and CM by women with PCOS, and the rate of adverse eventsattributable to reduced pharmaceutical effectiveness. The rate of adverse events reported here was not as low as in other studies. A survey of TCM (Chineseherbal medicine and acupuncture) practitioners dem- onstrated adverse reaction rates of one per 633 con- sultations [23]. Comparatively there were six adversereactions for TCM out of 304 CM users. Our datainclude self-reported ad verse reactions by self- prescribing consumers with potentially poorly in- formed treatment choices. This may explain the higherrates of adverse reactions in this case. On the other hand, adverse reactions reported by TCM practitioners m a yb ea tr i s ko fr e p o r t i n g bias. Our research high- lights that women with PCOS do experience adverse reactions when using CM, despite perceptions of low risk. This study does have some methodological limitations. We were unable to directly assess non-response and se- lection bias for the Facebook group. The referral to thesurvey by administrators of other Facebook support groups limited our ability to gauge unsolicited invita- tions and data were not available for assessment usingthe continuum of resistance model. Generalizations are limited to computer literate women with English lan- guage skills and other groups of women may be under-represented. However the results may be generalisable to women with PCOS. Women reported similar preva- lence for key PCOS signs [25]). This suggests that the respondents resemble aclinical population with PCOS. We also attained a good response rate without response bias from women with PCOS in a non-clinical setting, not restricted by geo-graphical location. This survey had high completion rates and suggests that the methods were acceptable to women. For these reasons our data are likely to reflectthe authentic views of women with PCOS in the com- munity. This research was focused on the use of CM by women with PCOS and differentiates CM from otherlifestyle practices; however women often use CM within the context of other lifestyle behaviors, including diet and exercise. The prevalence, patterns and attitudes to-wards diet and exercise of women with PCOS was be- yond the scope of the present article. Conclusion Complementary medicine may present a treatment op- tion with high acceptance by women; this study is an important step in developing our understanding of this group of women 's views and patterns of CM use.
