Jill Carpenter Evaluation and Research Program Assistant [DJCarpenter@csi.edu](mailto:DJCarpenter@csi.edu) CSI's Non-traditional Educator Preparation Program is unique in that is designed as a residency model for new teachers' of record who are supported with flexible coursework, a personal mentor, and validated performance assessments that are drawn from the candidate's actual teaching experience. Unlike traditional preparation programs, we strive to individualize each learning plan, accounting for the strengths each teacher-candidate brings. We utilize nationally recognized best practices throughout our instructional modules and performance assessments that are aligned with State Standards and the Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching Clusters. The Framework Clusters have been designed by Danielson to focus educators on groupings of the Framework components that better facilitate professional growth across the four Framework Domains and twenty-two Components (the current foundation of Idaho's teacher evaluation process). These modules can be accessed at almost any time, and from anywhere in the state. Most important, however, is our preparation program's emphasis on hands-on training and individualized, consistent support for our candidates provided by a highly skilled mentor. The goal of CSI's teacher preparation program is to address Idaho's current teacher shortage by ensuring more flexible and robust training options to support emergency hires throughout Idaho school districts, but also expanding our program to fulfill our vision of partnering with districts to proactively create and fill local teacher pipelines. Our aim is to work with district leaders to identify career-changers within their communities, and paraprofessionals that we can guide toward the attainment of a bachelor's degree as necessary. This partnership will enable these candidates to become fully certified and focused on continuous professional learning prior to taking on the responsibilities of a full-time teacher of record. Candidates must complete each of the five modules and pass the culminating Performance Assessment Task (PAT) with a Basic or Better score. Modules are offered each semester, with the Professionalism Module completed in a shortened session over the summer. All coursework can be completed remotely. Each candidate is assigned a mentor to support them throughout the program, and modules offered during the Fall and Spring semesters include up to 25 hours of CSI Mentor support. ($1,000 tuition per module. [Grant assistance available](https://idaholaunch.com/apply-for-training-funds/).) The Competency Track Option (CTO) is available to well-qualified candidates who have completed or nearly completed a traditional educator preparation program (EPP), but who do not hold a current, valid Idaho Standard Instructional Certificate. Examples of this might include: a candidate who was unable to quit working in order to complete the EPP's student teaching requirement, a candidate who completed all EPP requirements but never applied for an Initial Certification, a candidate who could not pass the EPP's Praxis testing requirement, a candidate whose certification lapsed and is not eligible for reinstatement, an out of state expired certificate holder, etc. CTO candidates will be required to serve as a teacher of record (teaching at least five hours per week in the content area for which they are seeking certification) while completing the following requirements: Our Teacher to New (TtN) option is available to any Idaho certified teacher seeking to add a new endorsement area to their existing certificate and requires the following: *Additional modules may be required per individual candidate need In April 2018, the State Board of Education approved the College of Southern Idaho to offer a unique teacher preparation program, designed specifically to make a contribution to the exceptional teacher shortages plaguing the schools in our community. In the state's 2018 Teacher Pipeline Report, it was reported that Region 4 has the highest percentage of teachers working without full certification; specifically, at least one out of every ten teachers is practicing without full certification. This is a fact that could have a long-term, negative impact on our region. Multiple studies have shown that teacher quality is the most critical factor in a child's education, and while an ineffective teacher can put students at an academic disadvantage and affect their progress for years, a student with a highly effective teacher can have positive long term academic gains. Our teacher preparation program is striving to address this issue in all Idaho school district regions by providing a highly innovative, practical approach to supporting and preparing the many teachers in our community who are teaching while working toward full certification. As a service to our Region 4 district partners, we ask potential candidates who want to teach (but are not already in a school setting) to fill out a brief form that we can share with HR directors. Because most Region 4 districts are familiar with and supportive of our program, it is not uncommon that people from this list are asked to interview when certificated applicants cannot be found. In some cases, potential candidates have seamlessly transitioned into full-time teachers of record through a three-way partnership between CSI the candidate, and the school district. Each module (including the cost of the mentor and the scoring of performance assessments) is $1,000. (Total cost to the candidate for five modules is $5,000 over two years.) To challenge a module and do the Performance Assessment only is $500 per module. (Five total assessments can be taken for the cost of $2,500.) The cost for certified teachers to add an additional endorsement takes only one semester, at the cost of $1,500. CSI has a payment program that candidates can take advantage of, and many districts are utilizing Title II funds to help defray a candidate's expenses. In order to begin taking modules, a candidate must hold a bachelor's degree, have regular access to an observable classroom environment and be able to actively teach lessons in the content area in which they are seeking certification. Therefore, to successfully complete module requirements, candidates must be employed as a teacher of record, or as a paraprofessional on a case-by-case basis. Paraprofessionals can be successful in this program if they are allowed at least five (5) hours of teaching per week in the content area for which they are seeking certification. Unless a paraprofessional has abundant support from their district, administrator, and cooperating teacher, completing the module requirements can be quite challenging when not serving as a teacher of record.
