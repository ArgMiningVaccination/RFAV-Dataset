And while nail polishes may make you think of [nail design trends](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-trending-nail-designs) (we shapes](https://www.glamour.com/story/nail-shape-guide) (read: [squoval](https://www.glamour.com/story/squoval-nails)), toxins are very real part of the nail-care experience. For context: In the world of beauty, \"toxins\" has lost most of its meaning. Same with \"nontoxic,\" because the terms don't have concrete, universal definitions. With nontoxic nail polish, however, ingredients are slightly more transparent, as more [nail brands](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/most-popular-nail-colors) have agreed upon a list of potentially harmful chemicals to avoid. And, as with skin care before it, the [clean beauty](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/beauty-awards-natural-beauty-product-winners) trend has made shoppers more aware than ever about what they're putting in\u2014and on\u2014their body. But what exactly does nontoxic or healthy nail polish mean? Let's break it down. How toxic is nail polish? Here's the big question: Is nail polish toxic? \"Traditional nail polishes can have potentially harmful toxins that become dangerous when they are airborne and breathed into our bodies consistently over time,\" says [Nadine Abramcyk](https://www.instagram.com/nadine.abramcyk/?hl=en), cofounder and head of brand at New York City salon [Tenoverten](https://tenoverten.com/). \"One example of such an ingredient is toluene, which can cause damage to the nervous system with high exposure and was traditionally included in polish formulas to create a smooth finish on the nail.\" Is there such a thing as nontoxic nail polish? Good news: Following a [2015 study](https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2015/10/more-bad-news-about-nail-polish#.WrAmhdOGOi4) that found chemicals in lacquers can absorb through our nails and into our bodies, nail polish brands have begun to weed out ingredients that could negatively affect our health. The most common term you'll see among nontoxic or natural nail polish is \"three-free,\" which means a polish is made without [formaldehyde](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/formaldehyde.html) (which is classified as a human carcinogen), [toluene](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/toluene/health_hazards.html) (a common solvent), and [dibutyl phthalate](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/dibutyl-phthalate.pdf) (which helps create long-wear formulas). What are the most toxic ingredients in nail polish? As we mentioned, formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate are the \"big three\" ingredients considered to be the most potentially disruptive. Many nontoxic formulations are now going further, though, to eliminate other harmful ingredients like formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, xylene, and TPHP. When a nontoxic or natural nail polish doesn't contain those additives, that's when you'll see 5-, 7-, 9-, or 10-free written on the label. Is nail polish toxic to breathe? Yes, to some extent, but the greater risk is for those who work in a salon, which is worth keeping in mind when you're deciding [what to tip your manicurist](https://www.glamour.com/story/what-to-tip-nail-salon). \"The damages traditional nail polish fumes pose are much more potent for salon workers than the individual getting their nails done,\" Abramcyk says. \"While inhaling polish fumes is less than ideal, the burden overwhelmingly falls on the manicurist, who has a much higher level of exposure.\" If you DIY your nail care, you shouldn't worry about it\u2014and don't miss our tips for [how to paint your nails](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-paint-your-nails-manicurist-advice) like a pro. Why you should use nontoxic nail polish? Some people might seek out a nontoxic nail polish during times like pregnancy, when they're more aware of the various chemicals in their beauty products, full stop. (While there are no official standard pregnancy-safe nail polishes, these clean nail polish brands are a pretty good start.) They may also be more eco-friendly; some even offer vegan nail polish. While there's long been a desire to use [nontoxic beauty products](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/non-toxic-beauty-products), the clean nail polishes didn't always perform as well as their traditional counterparts. But nontoxic nail polish brands have come a long way since then; they now offer chip-resistant formulations, [nail strengtheners](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-nail-strengthener-treatments), topcoats, and even other nail-care products like cuticle oil and nail polish remover. (Still, it's good to remember the best practices for [how to keep your manicure from chipping](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/manicure-tips-how-to-keep-nail-polish-from-chipping).) You can also find a range of nail colors. Ultimately, \"we no longer have to sacrifice our health to get a long-lasting, high-shine manicure,\" says Abramcyk. FYI: If you're devoted to gel polish, nontoxic alternatives are still in the works. However, \"they are getting less harsh, and that's a great sign that we are moving in the right direction as an industry,\" she says. With this in mind, Glamour's staff got down to testing a spate of chic, thoughtful formulas, and came away impressed with the ones below.
