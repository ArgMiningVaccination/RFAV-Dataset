They took their chal- lenge seriously, they learned a great deal from each other,and they came to terms with the choices in ways that wouldastonish many political leaders and technical experts inhealth care. Citizens were quick to grasp the budgetary andtechnological pressures we face, and yet they were able toarticulate a set of values-based choices about a system thatis immensely important to them. They were remarkablypragmatic and clear about the choices. This dialogue was commissioned by the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, led by Roy Ro-manow. The dialogue involved 12 groups of 40 citizens, se-lected to represent the Canadian population. Over thecourse of a full day, they constructed a consensus view ofwhat an ideal health care system would look like in 10years' time, and then worked through the trade-offs andchoices that would make that system financially sustainable.The Commission will publish the report on this dialoguethis month. Mr. Romanow is also engaged in an intensivedialogue with the stakeholders \u2014 providers, managers andgovernments. In his final report in November, he willtherefore have a unique opportunity to create the synthesisof the values base of Canadians with the best technical ad-vice available from the people who govern, manage and de-liver health care in Canada.Mr. Romanow will have all the right materials to reno- vate the medicare edifice. In November, we shall see whatarchitecture he recommends. Reference 1. National Forum on Health. Canada health action: building the legacy , vol. II, Synthesis Reports and Issues Papers.

The au-thors found that while some students had negative attitudestoward vaccination on entering their training for the pro-fession, many others appeared to develop such attitudes asthey progressed through their studies. Yet the core curricu- lum of the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College(CMCC), where the survey was conducted, teaches bothimmunology and health promotion 7and is itself supportive of vaccination. In addition, the policy viewpoint of theCanadian Chiropractic Association also supports vaccina-tion as it is currently practised in Canada. 5It seems that the negative attitudes acquired by some students resulted fromtheir stated reliance on more \"informal\" sources of vaccineinformation during their studies, such as the general chiro-practic literature and informal talks held at the college. Some of the attitudes expressed by CMCC students are truly disturbing. That 23.5% of the 119 fourth-year stu-dents agreed with the statement that \"there is little scien-tific proof that immunization prevents infectious disease\"and 16.8% agreed that \"vaccines have not substantiallychanged the incidence of any major infectious disease\" isArticles to date in this series Lewis S.

CMAJ 2002;166(11):1421-2.Commentary CMAJ \u007f JUNE 11, 2002; 166 (12) 1545difficult to understand, given that smallpox has been eradi- cated, polio is on the verge of eradication and measles isnear elimination from the Western Hemisphere. These ac-complishments are clearly presented in basic public healthcourses and remain the subject of media attention. The greatest concern about the negative attitudes to- ward vaccination of some of the CMCC students is that, inlight of the growing prevalence of chiropractic care inCanada and elsewhere, 8there is a risk that these attitudes will be passed on to patients.2,5Surveys have shown, not surprisingly, that parents' get most of their informationabout vaccination from their doctors. 9However, the extent to which those who seek chiropractic care might be influ-enced by their chiropractor's views is unknown. There are a number of reasons why some chiropractors might oppose vaccination, 5as well as suggestions about where they might acquire those beliefs. However, the studyreported here 6suggests that even in the face of education to the contrary (provided by their own professional school)and despite the policies of their professional association,negative beliefs are still acquired or persist in a sizeable mi-nority of students. The propagation of these negative atti-tudes could chip away at vaccination coverage and put in-fants and children in harm's way once again, something nohealth care professional should want. Reliable and accessible information about vaccines, along with the tools to evaluate myths and invalid claimsabout their safety, may help to put vaccination decisions intheir proper perspective. For the general public, the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, along with publichealth partners such as the American Academy of Pedi-atrics, the Immunization Action Coalition and the NationalNetwork for Immunization Information, have created andmaintain comprehensive information about vaccination,disseminated through a variety of channels, including theInternet, telephone hotlines and traditional mail. Canada isdoing the same through its Canadian ImmunizationAwareness Program. 10Similarly, although critical appraisal and research skills are taught to CMCC students,7these clearly need to be reinforced during the lectures that dis-cuss vaccination as a health promotion practice, to evenbetter equip students to separate fact from fiction, particu-larly in the context of the informal lectures and discussionsin which they participate. The survey reported by Busseand colleagues 6did not measure the degree to which stu- dents truly believe some of the more common myths re-lated to vaccination, nor did it evaluate the reasons for de-velopment of negative attitudes regarding the value ofinfant and adult vaccination recommendations. Thus, itwould be of interest to ascertain how informal sessions atthe college are organized, what their content is and, mostimportant, why they appear to undermine concepts taughtin the core curriculum.Although chiropractic professionals have not tradition- ally been considered influential in discussions of vaccina-tion-related issues, it is clear from this study and others thatthey are interested and engaged. However, there is a per-ception among some in the medical profession that the chi-ropractic profession is \"antivaccine,\" which makes it diffi-cult for the 2 groups to work together. In reality, only asegment of the chiropractic profession holds such views.Given that CMCC graduates some 80% of all chiroprac-tors in Canada and is located close to the University ofToronto, the largest medical school in the country, promo-tion of vaccination programs might be an ideal model forencouraging medical and chiropractic students to work to-gether and learn from each other. To our knowledge, suchcollaboration has not been formally attempted. Members ofthe public seeking the best combination of health care forthemselves and their families would only benefit if thiscould be achieved. References 1.
