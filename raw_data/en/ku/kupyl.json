Unfortunately, its claims of being \"evidence-based\" aside, the conference followed the WHO's usual pattern of serving as propaganda, not science. The summit was one-sided, organized by believers with the only speakers being believers, to promote a predetermined policy goal of promoting traditional medicine and justify \"integrating\" it with...

It's basically the same as the last strategic plan, but with one new addition. It's not really a new addition, but it signals a resurrection of an old trope about \"integrating\" quackery with science-based medicine.

[Scott Gavura](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/scottg416/)/ June 24, 2021 [](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-poorly-conceived-study-fails-to-prove-ayurveda-works/) [A Poorly Conceived Study Fails to Prove Ayurveda Works](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-poorly-conceived-study-fails-to-prove-ayurveda-works/) Quackery is alive, well, and government-supported in India, as demonstrated by a terrible study of Ayurveda.

A recent review discovers plenty of pseudoscience. [Jann Bellamy](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/versus/)/ February 27, 2020 [](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ayurvedic-practitioners-push-licensing-in-colorado/) [Ayurvedic practitioners push for licensing in Colorado](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ayurvedic-practitioners-push-licensing-in-colorado/) Ayurvedic practitioners' attempt to become licensed health care professionals in Colorado failed an initial review but that is unlikely to stop them from pursuing their goal. Ayurveda is pseudoscience and its practices can be dangerous. Unfortunately, that is no barrier to state licensing.

There is no evidence that they work or even that they contain gold, silver, or copper.

It claims to be a scientific presentation, but it reveals just how unscientific naturopathy is. It mixes good science with bad science, pseudoscience, outright errors of fact, vitalism, philosophy, ancient history, superstition, gullibility, misrepresentations, metaphysics, religion, hearsay, opinion, and anecdotes.

Can Cow Therapy Cure Cancer?](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/cowabunga-can-cow-therapy-cure-cancer/) A hospital in India offers to cure cancer in 11 days with Ayurveda and cow therapy, giving patients a drink of desi cow milk, yogurt, ghee, urine, and dung. It's very unlikely that cow therapy can cure cancer; but in another sense, the author of the book Holy Cancer says it \"healed\" him.

Those who promote pseudoscientific or prescientific medicine, however, frequently appeal to other ways of knowing, often ancient knowledge from other cultures and pointing out deficiencies in SBM to justify promoting their treatments. Do their justifications hold water? [David Gorski](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/author/david-gorski/)/ June 11, 2018 "}
