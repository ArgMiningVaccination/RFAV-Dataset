If you offer nutrition or dietary counseling as part of your service, you should proclaim your professional status by joining the [American Association of Nutritional Consultants]. When you display the prestigious A.A.N.C. Membership Certificate on your wall, you make your clients, patients, and professional colleagues aware of your commitment to high standards and professional competence in Nutrition Counseling. And you demonstrate your dedication to the cause of good health through nutrition by supporting your Professional Association. So stated \"An Open Letter To All Health Professionals\" in mid-1980s issues of The Nutrition & Dietary Consultant, the monthly publication of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants (AANC). The certificate\u2014printed on imitation parchment paper and complete with gold seal and red ribbon\u2014does indeed look attractive and professional. But those who encounter it would be wise to look closely at what it signifies. AANC's Roots According to AANC's founder, Henry Holcomb, the group began operations in 1981 as the American Association of Nutrition & Dietary Consultants (AANDC). During 1983, AANDC assumed its current name and absorbed a similar group, the International Academy of Nutritional Consultants (IANC). IANC was formed in 1979 by [Kurt Donsbach, D.C.](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/donsbach.html), founder and president of Donsbach University School of Nutrition, a nonaccredited correspondence school. Donsbach, dubbed \"the vitamin king\" by the Los Angeles Times, was also board chairman of the National Health Federation, a group that promotes the gamut of dubious health practices. Donsbach has had two criminal convictions. In 1971 he pled guilty to practicing medicine without a license. In 1997, he pled guilty to income tax evasion and smuggling unapproved drugs. His countless commercial ventures have included health-food retailing; supplement manufacturing and marketing; writing, publishing, and broadcasting; distributing dubious credentials; and operating Mexican clinics that administer unsubstantiated treatments for cancer and many other conditions. Regular IANC membership, which was open to anyone, cost $10 per year (later raised to $12/year) and included a subscription to its journal. \"Professional membership,\" which cost $50 per year, included a directory listing plus a \"beautiful certificate for your office.\" Sustaining membership, $150 a year, entitled members to a 15% discount on advertising in the journal. Most of the 50 or so sustaining members had commercial interests in methods promoted by the journal. Applicants for professional or sustaining membership were asked to name their professional degree and specialty. However, no questions were asked about the origin of the degree, and no effort was made to check the credentials or reputation of any applicant. In 1979, IANC began publishing The Journal of the International Academy of Nutritional Consultants with a press run of 25,000 copies, most of which were sent free-of-charge to chiropractors. Its first editor was Alan Nittler, M.D., a California physician who had lost his license to practice medicine in 1975 as a result of using unproven \"nutritional therapies.\" After three issues he was replaced by Hans Kugler, Ph.D., president of the International Academy of Wholistic Health and Medicine, and author of Seven Keys to a Longer Life. In 1981, the journal was renamed Health Express, Donsbach took over as editor-in-chief, and marketing was begun through health food stores and newsstands. During most of 1982, Holcomb served as editor, general manager, and director of sales, while Donsbach was listed on the masthead either as editorial director or as editor-in-chief. AANC's membership structure was similar to that of IANC. Durinv the 1980s, associate membership cost $30, professional membership cost $50, sustaining membership cost $100, and lifetime membership was $250. In June 1986, it listed 111 lifetime members. During most of AANC's existence, membership applications have asked nothing about qualifications but noted that \"degree initials, if any\" would appear on the certificate if included on the application. AANC's \"Journal\" AANC's \"journal\" began in 1983 as a tabloid newspaper called The Nutrition and Dietary Consultant and was renamed The Nutritional Consultant later that year. When IANC and AANC merged, their publications merged to become The Nutritional Consultant & Health Express (\"The Magazine People Read For Nutritional Advice\"). Toward the end of 1984, it was called Your Nutritional Consultant (\"The Magazine America Reads for Nutritional Advice\"). In 1985, it again became The Nutrition & Dietary Consultant (\"America's Only Journal For The Practicing Professional\"). Until the mid-1980s, Henry Holcomb was designated as publisher and his wife, Myra E. Holcomb, who was also AANC's executive secretary, was listed as editor and general manager. The Statement of Ownership, Management and Circulation submitted to the Postal Service in October 1985 listed the two of them as owners and declared a paid circulation of 8,196, down from 12,685 in 1984. In March 1986, however, Henry's name disappeared without explanation from AANC publications and Myra was designated as publisher and editor. At the same time, the journal reverted to tabloid newspaper format in order to save money. AANC said that its journal was \"edited specifically for you who do now, or plan in the future, to earn all or part of your income through counseling on good health or proper nutrition, and for those of you who offer nutritional advice as part of your overall professional services.\" Each issue contained articles promoting unproven and unscientific practices as well as ads for questionable products, some of which have been subjected to government enforcement action for misbranding. For the first few issues after the merger that formed AANC, its national board of counselors was listed on the journal's masthead with Donsbach as chairman. But a few months later, this listing was dropped and Donsbach's name appeared as one of six contributing editors. At various times, AANC's letterhead listed seven, eight, or nine members on its national board of counselors, one of whom, Gary Pace, sported a \"Ph.D., degree from Donsbach University. Pace practiced as a nutrition counselor in Garden City, New York. In 1985, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed a civil suit accusing him of practicing medicine without a license, false advertising, and illegal use of educational credentials. Pace's schemes, said Abrams, had induced hundreds of consumers to pay him for improper physical examinations, worthless laboratory tests (including hair analysis and herbal crystallization analysis), bogus nutritional advice, and unnecessary vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements. Abrams said that at least 251 clients had paid Pace an average of $307 during the previous four years. Some of Pace's female clients reported that Pace had examined their breasts or genitals. Several clients underwent significant expense to obtain medical reassurance that they did not have various diseases that Pace said they had. One was advised by her medical doctor to stop taking vitamin A because her palms had become yellow as a result of overdosage. Pace also taught in the extension division of a local community college and hosted a radio program. The case was settled with an injunction forbidding Pace from engaging in the unlawful practice of medicine or using \"Ph.D.\" or \"Dr.\" in dealings with the public unless he obtains recognized credentials. During the same period, Abrams obtained a court order forbidding Donsbach University from marketing its courses to New York State residents. Shortly after Abrams filed suits against Pace and Donsbach, Pace was removed from the AANC board and Donsbach's name disappeared from the masthead of The Nutrition and Dietary Consultant. AANC Directories AANC's 1986 National Profile Directory of Nutritional Consultants listed 686 practicing \"professional nutritionists,\" but stated that since listing required a written request, the list \"in no way represents the total membership of AANC which at press time stood at 5,618.\" (This number was probably inaccurate because it is identical with the number listed in the 1985 directory.) Directory listings included the consultant's name, address, telephone number, tests utilized, modalities offered, and areas of specialization. Nineteen percent of those cited were chiropractors. Nine percent had no listed degree, 12% a B.A. or B.S., 10% an M.A. or M.S., 23% a Ph.D., and 3% a medical degree. The rest displayed one or more of some 40 sets of initials, many of which I could not recognize. \"Tests utilized\" include complete workup by a medical doctor, [hair analysis](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html), [herbal crystallization analysis](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/hca.html), urine analysis, blood analysis, a test to determine metabolic type, a saliva test, [iridology](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html), [kinesiology](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/ak.html), computerized questionnaires, diet nursing, optometry, osteopathy, reflexology, colonic irrigation, chiropractic, dentistry, biofeedback, hydrotherapy, massage, yoga and megavitamin and mineral therapy. The \"nutritional support specialties\" were allergies, cancer, diabetic nutrition, drug rehabilitation, endocrine disturbances, general nutrition, geriatric nutrition, hypoglycemia, pediatric nutrition, skin conditions, smoking cessation, sports nutrition, stress management, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, weight control, premenstrual syndrome, prenatal nutrition, heart and blood conditions, digestive problems, and spines, bones, joints. AANC's directories contained ads similar to those in its journal. The 1985 edition included ads for homeopathic remedies, pau d'arco (a supposed cancer remedy), amino acid products, two \"oral chelation\" products that were subsequently ordered off the market, a colonic irrigator, and hair analysis (for which AANC members received a 36% discount). The 1986 directory included ads for food supplements and a Mexican hospital where laetrile and other quack treatments are administered. Anyone Could Join Membership in AANC and its predecessors has been open to anyone. In 1983, Sassafras Herbert (a poodle) became a professional member of AANDC and Charlie Herbert (a cat) secured professional membership in IANC. Both were household pets of Victor Herbert, M.D., J.D., a prominent nutrition scientist. All Dr. Herbert did was submit their name and address plus $50. Donsbach reacted to this news by claiming that that professional members in IANC were required to have \"adequate professional background . . . either a degree in the healing arts or a graduate of Donsbach University.\" The IANC application had asked four questions on professional background, but \"Charlie\" had left them blank. Despite widespread publicity of the pets' entry into the world of nutritional consultation, their memberships were not cancelled. After the AANDC membership year was up, Dr. Herbert obtained a new \"professional membership\" in AANC by sending $50 plus the name and address of another dog. In January 1985, ads in The Nutrition & Dietary Consultant began inviting readers to send for a \"Member Application and Qualifications Questionnaire.\" The application asked for name, address, phone number, school attended, major, degree and year earned, how long the applicant has been involved professionally in the field of nutrition, names of other health associations to which the applicant belongs, and the names of two nutrition-oriented health care professionals who can provide references. After this process began, an individual known to me completed an application under an assumed name, listing a degree from a nutrition diploma mill and providing appropriate references. Membership was granted as soon as the application was received. AANC did write to the persons listed as references\u2014not for information about the applicant, but to ask them to join AANC! Another person I know bypassed the application process and simply sent a $50 check and the name and address of her daughter's pet hamster (see below). She too was notified of acceptance within a few days. Several subsequent issues of The Nutrition and Dietary Consultant contained a coupon application for membership which, as in previous years, asked only the applicant's name, address, and \"degree initials, if any.\" | | | | This certificate was issued during the mid-1980s to a pet hamster In 2004, [Ben Goldacre](http://www.badscience.net/?p=131), who writes a \"Bad Science\" column for the British Guardian newspaper, obtained a professional member certificate in the name of his cat, who had died in 2003. \"Certification\" AANC's professional members are also invited to become \"Certified Nutrition Consultants.\" According to AANC: The trademark designation CNC after a Nutritional Consultant's name testifies to the world that the practitioner's qualifications have been certified by his or her Professional Association\u2014that he or she has met professional requirements in addition to, and beyond, normal academic studies and/or professional experience. Some AANC literature referred to an \"RNC\" designation for \"Registered Nutritional Consultant.\" In 1989, AANC listed about 200 \"Certified Nutritional Consultants,\" including James F. Balch, Jr., M.D., and his wife Phyllis, coauthors of Prescription for Nutritional Healing, an irresponsible book that many health-food retailers use to prescribe products for their customers According to an article by Myra Holcomb, CNC applicants had to be professional members in good standing in AANC \"and have met the high eligibility requirements for membership.\" However, the CNC application form asked nothing about training, experience or qualifications, but merely requested the names of three professional references (who, when I applied, were not contacted). The requirements included: - Payment of a $150 fee - Demonstrated knowledge of practice management and the laws pertaining to nutritional consulting - Passage of a self-administered 2,000-question test on general and applied nutrition. - Written acknowledgement that information presented in the certification program \"is not intended as a substitute for licensed medical care, and is offered for educational purposes only.\" - Release of AANC \"from any damages, claims, or liabilities whatsoever resulting from the information presented.\" The CNC nutrition exam was divided into sections on basic anatomy, principles of nutrition, vitamin therapy, nutrition and common ailments, biochemical individuality, higher nutrition, orthomolecular nutrition, nutrition against disease, diet and disease, child nutrition, geriatrics, acquired body toxins and their elimination, and psychodietetics. Candidates were required to submit a notarized statement that no \"second party\" helped with the test, but they were given a list of books, purchasable from AANC, each of which could help answer the questions in one section of the test. Successful applicants received an attractive certificate. The test questions were divided about equally into multiple choice and true/false types. Candidates were asked to choose \"the most accurate\" answer, even though in some cases, \"if the candidate is real sharp and wants to get tricky, he or she might be able to point to special cases or circumstances where none of the choices is correct.\" Nutrition experts who reviewed portions of the exam at my request noted that many questions had no correct answer and that the test contained many misspelled words. The clinical significance of some questions\u2014like one about whether whole wheat flour could support the life of weevils\u2014were rather obscure. The best known individual who displays AANC's \"CNC\" credential is probably Phyllis A. Balch, CNC, co-author of [Prescription for Nutritional Healing](http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/FDAActions/global.html#naturalhealing), a book that recommends large numbers of herbs and dietary suppleents for hundreds of diseases and conditions. Since 1999, I have located several Web sites operated by others who identify themselves as members of AANC, IANC, AANDC, and/or use the \"CNC\" designation: [Adriaan Van Beveren, PhD, CNC](http://drvan.net/index.html), who operates the Health Integration Center in Skillman, New Jersey, represents himself as a clinical physiologist and nutritional biochemist. Several years ago, his Web site indicated that he had \"chosen to emphasize the function (enzymology) of healthy people\" and that, \"Distress, accidents, and auto-intoxication make up the bulk of discomfort in our culture. Distressing vibrations (such as those resulting from the inability to be in charge of one's own life) percolate up from the auric fields affecting molecular and biochemical events manifesting in physiological and psychological phenomena and, in time, finally incorporate anatomical consequences.\" [David Cohen, ND, PhD, MH, CNC](http://www.doctordavidcohen.net/), whose Web sites describe him as \"the greatest naturopathic doctor in America.\" [Brenda R.

[Paul Yanick, Jr.](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aaqm.html), who promotes and practices \"quantum medicine.\" \"Nutritionist\" Licensing In the mid-1980s, dietitians began spearheading bills to restrict use of the word \"nutritionist\" to individuals with recognized credentials. Some of the bills also define \"nutrition practice\" and restrict it to licensed practitioners. This drive was stimulated largely by the rise of nonaccredited nutrition schools and of organizations such as AANC. The dietitians believe\u2014as I do\u2014that [government should try to protect the public against individuals who misrepresent their credentials](http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/licensing.html). AANC opposed these bills and even drafted a model \"Nutritional Counselors Licensing Act\" that would have enabled its members to gain licensure. However, as far as I know, its activities had little political impact. Current Status I stopped tracking AANC in 1989 and saw no further indication of its existence until January 1998, when Donsbach announced that he had reassumed its leadership in 1994 but later passed it to Wendell W. Whitman, B.A., M. Div., N.D. The announcement appeared as an editorial in the first issue of Healthkeepers Magazine, which was described as a quarterly magazine formed by \"a merger of the former Journal of the Certified Natural Health Professional and the HealthKeepers Journal into an all encompassing publication which is a voice for all natural health professionals and nutritionists.\" The magazine describes Whitman as a nutritional consultant with 12 years of experience. His naturopathic degree is from Clayton University a nonaccredited correspondence school in Birmingham, Alabama. [Whitman is also the cofounder of the ] [National Association of Certified Natural Health Professionals](http://www.cnhp.org/) and cofounder and dean of [Trinity College of Natural Health](http://www.trinityschool.org/), a correspondence school offering Master Herbalist (M.H.) and Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.) \"degrees\" and a Certificate in Nutritional Counseling (C.N.C.). The college is said to be \"certified\" by American Naturopathic Medical Certification and Accreditation Board, Inc., (which is not an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education). The school's Web site has listed several hundred naturopathy graduates. A [biographical sketch](http://www.cnhp.org/wendell.whitman.html) on the CNHP Web site states that Whitman uses kinesiology, iridology, herbology, and nutritional therapy in his work. [HealthKeepers](http://www.healthkeepers.net/) also has a Web site. Currently, the AANC and the National Association of Certified Natural Health Professionals are both located in Indiana. In July 2004, the online AANC directory listed about 850 names and the online National Association of Certified Natural Health Professionals directory listed about 4,700 CNHP's. In my opinion, these groups have one potentially valuable aspect: Membership in them is a reliable sign of someone not to consult for advice. This article was revised on November 27, 2007. [Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-eight-hundred-thirty-nine) [Professional Misconduct Findings against Dr. D. W. Steeper](https://quackwatch.org/cases/foreign/steeper/) In 1990, the New Zealand Medical Journal described how a homeopathic physician had used a Vegatest device to diagnose allergies in three infants. In each case, the device was applied to the mother with the child on the mother's lap or roaming about the examining room. The doctor also diagnosed \"miasms,\" which, if not removed, would prove fatal later in life. The Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee ordered that he be censured, pay a penalty of NZ$900 plus NZ$25,000 for costs and expenses, and follow certain standards of care for three years. The Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (MPDC) held a three day hearing, 28, 29 June and 11 August 1989 to inquire into a charge of professional misconduct against Dr D W Steeper of Auckland ... In 1990, the New Zealand Medical Journal described how a homeopathic physician had used a Vegatest device to diagnose allergies in three infants. In each case, the device was applied to the mother with the child on the mother's lap or roaming about the examining room. The doctor also diagnosed \"miasms,\" which, if not removed, would prove fatal later in life. The Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee ordered that he be censured, pay a penalty of NZ$900 plus NZ$25,000 for costs and expenses, and follow certain standards of care for three years. The Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (MPDC) held a three day hearing, 28, 29 June and 11 August 1989 to inquire into a charge of professional misconduct against Dr D W Steeper of Auckland by the Preliminary Proceedings Committee of the Medical Council in connection with Dr Steeper's management of three young children. The allegations related to Dr Steeper's use of the Vega testing machine for diagnosing and treating these three infants without carrying out a medical assessment or examination, and furthermore from the Vega test procedures Dr Steeper conveyed statements to the parents of the patients that were unjustified misleading and hurtful and fell below the proper standard of patient care. Dr Steeper in using these unproven and unorthodox techniques used his orthodox training and medical registration to convey respectability and authenticity to his practice, thus misleading his patients. The Facts The first patient consulted Dr Steeper on account of her 16-month-old child's sensitivity to wheat and dairy products, in the belief that Dr Steeper had special skills in the treatment of allergies and because he was a family practitioner as well as a homoeopath. Dr Steeper did not examine the infant but tested the child using the Vega machine, with the child on mother's lap and mother holding one electrode in one hand and the other electrode probing the mother's left middle toe. Subsequent testing of the child continued with the child running around the surgery. Dr Steeper claimed he directed questions from his own subconscious mind to the subconscious mind of the patient, with the answers being interpreted by the response of the Vega testing machine. The testing revealed allergies but also inherited chronic \"miasms\" from ancestors who may have had venereal or mental diseases, but that these evil \"miasms\" could be removed from the child by appropriate homoeopathic treatment. Dr. Steeper made predictions about diseases occurring later in life with death at 60 from carcinoma unless these \"miasms\" could be removed from the body by homoeopathic treatment which he prescribed. The lactose base of the homoeopathic medicine in this infant resulted in a violent gastrointestinal disturbance lasting several days. The second patient took her 20 month old son to Dr Steeper complaining of bouts of abdominal pain. Dr Steeper without examining the child, carried out the Vega test in the same manner as in the first patient, again with the child wandering around the doctor's surgery. There were also \"miasms\" resulting from a great grandmother with venereal disease and a prediction that the child would die from bowel carcinoma in his 60s, but that the treatment determined through the Vega testing could prolong his life by five years. The mother was also tested, and indicated diabetes in later life, and carcinoma of the cervix which again could be prevented by homoeopathic treatment. The infant died two months later from intestinal volvulus but this was not thought to be related to Dr Steeper's management. The third mother consulted Dr Steeper with her 12 month old infant who had been diagnosed as having asthma, with the expectation of allergy testing and dietary advice for that condition. Again without any preliminary assessment Dr Steeper undertook Vega testing in the manner of the two previous patients and indicated a mild selenium deficiency and allergies to caffeine, wheat and dairy products, with accumulated toxins due to previous vaccinations and \"miasms\" inherited from criminals in his ancestry. Dr Steeper predicted that this asthma would disappear at three years, recur in his 30s, with diabetes in his 40s and Alzheimer's disease in his 70s, but there was a possibility of a fatal road accident at 17. The mother was given homoeopathic remedies but subsequently consulted a paediatrician who advised head-up sleeping, while allergy testing revealed no significant allergies. Findings The committee heard extensive evidence from Dr Steeper, from supporters of his methods of diagnosis and treatment, and from satisfied patients, as well as prominent doctors in the academic and clinical spheres of medical practice. Dr Steeper did not dispute the evidence of the three mothers, but acknowledged the foolishness of his predictions and had now ceased this practice. 1. The committee found as a fact that Dr. Steeper failed to carry out a medical assessment of the three patients and keep records of his findings. Despite practising alternative medicine, there remains upon a medical practitioner a duty to act as a responsible practitioner would. In this respect Dr Steeper failed to take a clinical history, conduct examinations and keep adequate records of findings, and fell below the accepted standard for a medical practitioner and this failure amounted to professional misconduct. 2. The Vega test machine operates on the principle of a wheatstone bridge, and measures the potential differences between a small hand held electrode and a pencil probe electrode applied to the patient's left middle toe, a recognised acupuncture point, with the meter reading the result. Organ pathology is allegedly diagnosed by inserting a specific organ/disease ampoule in a receptacle which is part of the circuit. Dr Steeper extended the usual application of the machine by \"directing questions from his subconscious mind to the patient's subconscious\" and received answers through the response of the machine. Dr Steeper acknowledged that this bioenergetic system was operator dependent and not amenable to critical evaluation or examination. The hand out information sheets used by Dr Steeper gave the impression that the procedure and capabilities of the machine were established facts whereas in fact they were not. His use of the machine together with the hand out was misleading and caused the mothers considerable distress. The committee concluded that Dr Steeper's use of the Vega machine comprised professional misconduct. The committee recognised section 58 (4) of the Medical Practitioners Act 1968 which provides that \"no person shall be guilty of disgraceful conduct in a professional respect merely because he has adopted and practised any theory of medicine or surgery, if in so doing he has acted honestly and in good faith\". The committee accepted that Dr Steeper acted in good faith, but it did not consider that he adopted any \"theory of medicine or surgery\" in the use to which he put his machine. His use of the machine was far beyond any accepted theory of medicine. 3. It was accepted that Dr Steeper made statements to mothers of the patients which were misleading, hurtful and caused them distress and unnecessary anxiety. The advice of a medical practitioner is accepted by patients often without question and the advice as to \"miasms\" and predictable diseases or a potentially fatal accident in later life were given credence because they were made by a medical practitioner in whom the patients had placed their trust. Dr Steeper's actions in this regard fell well below those of a medical practitioner, and comprised professional misconduct. 4. The committee recognised and acknowledged that there is demand for alternative therapy from patients as well as practitioners who find that a proportion of patients do not have their expectations fulfilled through orthodox medicine. Nevertheless medical practitioners who practise alternative medicine should be conscious of the need for ensuring that their patients are fully informed as to the nature of the practices being undertaken. Where those practices depart too radically from orthodox medicine, the practitioner should question whether his role is in fact one of a medical practitioner, or some other type of practitioner. If the latter should be the case then the doctor should not operate under the guise of orthodox medicine. The fact of medical registration and holding oneself out as a medical practitioner does lead to patients accepting the treatment however radical given by the doctor, as having authenticity or credence. The patients in this case were mislead into initially accepting the reliability and authenticity of the manner in which Dr Steeper used his machine. The committee believed that this practice under the guise of orthodox medicine misled his patients and amounted to professional misconduct. 5. In the case of the first baby with known sensitivity to dairy products, the gastrointestinal disturbance was most likely due to lactose intolerance but the committee could not be certain of this. However the response of Dr Steeper following a request for advice from the mother concerning her distressed child, was threatening and implied that if the doctor's advice was not followed that the child would be sick throughout life and could die early. This advice was regarded by the mother as threatening and intimidating and in the view of the committee was inappropriate and comprised serious failure to provide adequate after care and amounted to professional misconduct. 6. Unorthodox or alternative medicine was not on trial. Specific allegations were made against Dr Steeper in the methods and manner in which he treated three patients together with statements and advice he gave to them. They were frightened, distressed and misled whilst all somewhat vulnerable as mothers of young children who consulted a medical practitioner who practised homoeopathy. In the committee's view the standing of a doctor as a registered medical practitioner enabled Dr Steeper to give credence or status to the use to which he put his machine, the predictions and diagnosis that he made. The committee had no doubt that in each of the respective cases alleged the behaviour of Dr Steeper fell substantially below the standard required of a registered medical practitioner and individually and cumulatively his actions comprised professional misconduct. While not going so far as to conclude that the actions were disgraceful conduct the committee was of the opinion that they bordered on that category of behaviour Penalty The Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee ordered that Dr Steeper be censured, that he pay a penalty of $900 to the New Zealand Medical Association, that he pay costs and expenses of $25 000 and that certain conditions be imposed upon his practice for a period of three years. Namely: - That Dr Steeper should undertake an adequate medical history and clinical examination of each patient, and fully record these in the written notes. - That where Dr Steeper employed alternative medical practices that the patients should be made aware of these and written consent obtained in advance. - That Dr Steeper should discontinue the practice of his particular \"extrapolations\" and communications of these to patients. - That Dr Steeper's practice be supervised and reported upon at quarterly intervals over that period.

Tasker Appellant v DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, STATE OF WASHINGTON, Respondents. | | | | | | | | | | NO. 35144-7-11 UNPUBLISHED OPINION PENOYAR, J. \u2014 Joyce Tasker appeals from the Department of Health's (DOH) decision that she engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ordered her to cease and desist and issued a fine for her unlicensed practices. Pro se, Tasker appealed the ALJ's decision to the trial court. The trial court affirmed and she now appeals to this court. We affirm. FACTS These facts are from the Department of Health Adjudicative Service Unit's factual findings. I. Facts Relating to Tasker's \"Practice of Medicine\" Joyce Tasker resides in Colville, Washington. She has never held a license to practice as a health care professional in Washington State. She had a web-based business in which she provided human electrodermal testing (EDT). Tasker used two EDT devices to perform her testing, \"Orion\" and a more recent model, \"Asyra.\" Administrative Record (AR) at 2007. Tasker's EDT devices emit a small direct electric current through a wire to a brass cylinder covered by moist gauze. The patient holds the brass cylinder while Tasker touches a probe connected to the EDT device by a second wire to \"acupuncture points\" on her patient's hand or foot. AR at 2008. As the probe touches the patient's body, a low-voltage circuit is created. The EDT device registers electric current flow through the patient's body on the device's monitor screen. It provides a numerical reading on a scale of 0 to 100. Using the numerical reading, Tasker evaluates whether the patient is \"balanced,\" if there is organ inflammation \"associated\" with the \"meridian\" being tested, or if \"organ stagnation and degeneration\" exists. AR at 2008. Tasker also connects the EDT device to a computer and the computer provides another numerical reading of the electric current through the patient's body. Tasker explains on her website that the computer testing is called Computerized Electrodermal Screening (CEDS). She claims: The meridian energy flow carries with it information about internal organs that can be used in diagnosis. This is the basis of the [CEDS]. The device used in CEDS is an electrodermal screening device, which works by measuring electrical resistance and polarization at acupuncture points and meridians. Through these safe, skin-level measurements, it is possible to analyze the bio-energy and bio-information produced by internal organs and system. . . . CEDS is one of the most thorough, powerful, and promising modern, holistic medical/diagnostic methodologies. CEDS addresses the body holistically for a number of reasons: A standard of CEDS examination enables the operator to quickly and safely collect information on 40 different individual systems. In other words, all of the body's individual parts are covered in an examination. The bio- information signal read by the CEDS is a very direct and true description of the condition of the body because it is created by the body. . . . Product testing allows the operator to test any and every type of medication on the individual patient, including those made from herbs, metals, nosodes, or sarcodes. This allows the operator to explore all types of available treatment. AR at 2009 (emphasis added). Tasker also explains on her website that she interprets the EDT results and then identifies the client's medical illnesses or conditions through the client's \"energy signature\" obtained by the EDT. AR at 2010. Tasker used EDT testing to identify her clients' \"electromagnetic signature, the immaterial electromagnetic signature of all kinds in [her clients'] bodies, whether it's Parkinson or something else.\" In a deposition, Tasker stated: You know my testing is for electromagnetic signatures. And so if I see the electromagnetic signature of, let's say a pituitary tumor, then if the person's question is \"could that be physical,\" then I would have to tell them what some of the physical indications would be, but it isn't telling them that they have the physical problem. It's just indicating to a person that these are the physical things that they would notice if it was\u2014if it was a physical thing. But I don't know, because I test for electromagnetic signatures. AR 2010-11, 1607 (emphasis added). After the EDT testing, Tasker creates a \"tincture\" based on the EDT readings and her evaluation. AR at 2011. She explains that the tincture is either a mixture of water and alcohol or a commercial preparation with the \"recording of the electromagnetic fields\" that are detected in the client through the EDT testing and stored in the computer \"imprinted into that tincture.\" AR at 2011. She uses the EDT test results to \"find a tincture that is as close to matching the electromagnetic fields of the client as possible.\" AR at 2012. Tasker claimed on her website that, through her EDT testing, she could evaluate any and every medication type and explore all available treatments. Tasker advised her clients to follow her recommendations, provided medicinal preparations for her clients, and conducted follow-up visits where she would adjust the client's treatment by providing additional tinctures based on subsequent EDT testing. She informed clients that she would identify appropriate dosages of a homeopathic infusion remedy after the testing. Tasker used her website to solicit clients. She would either test clients in person or obtain blood or saliva samples in the mail and perform testing on the samples. She provided instruction on her website for sending blood and salvia samples to her for EDT testing. She charged $150 for human testing, directed clients to fill out a \"health form,\" a \"disorder rating sheet,\" and a \"release form.\" AR at 2009. When Tasker received the samples in the mail, she tested the samples at her home in Colville and sent a remedy to the client. At one point, Tasker apparently began conducting her EDT readings on tribal land, attempting to deprive DOH of jurisdiction over her practices. Her website included a listing of remedies, corresponding prices, and client testimonials. Her website stated that \"JM\" had energy signatures of Alzheimer's disease, Epstein Barr virus, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; and \"JM\" stated: after testing 5 of the prescriptions my doctors had recommended I take, [Tasker] told me NOT to take 3 of the 5 ... In addition to telling me NOT to take or do for the next 10 weeks, she told me to take the 8 bottles of remedies three times per day in the doses of 3 drops each time. At the end of the 10 weeks I would be re- tested with her Orion computer system. AR at 2012. \"SM\" had a thyroid condition and stomach pains and stated that after Tasker's EDT testing, she experienced immediate relief. \"RG\" had psoriasis and indicated that his condition did not \"break out\" when he stopped using his medicine. AR at 2013. Tasker's website indicated that \"JT\" was cured of porphyria, chemical sensitivity, and kidney/gall bladder cancer. \"KV\" suffered from diabetes and a stroke and achieved improved circulation, increased mobility, weight loss, and was able to discontinue most of his prescribed medicines after Tasker's EDT testing. \"LM\" indicated that Tasker identified his pituitary tumor, cured his medical sensitivity, and cured his gallbladder pain through her EDT testing. Tasker's website also indicated that she treated \"DB,\" a seriously-ill cancer patient. II. Facts Relating to Tasker's \"Practice of Veterinary Medicine\" Tasker had a separate web-based business that provided electrodermal testing (EDT) for animals. She conducted the animal testing by placing the EDT probe in the owner's hand, who acted as a \"surrogate for delivering the animal's electromagnetic fields into the computer.\" AR at 2015. She also solicited saliva and blood samples from animals on her website. She charged $115 for the animal testing to identify pathogens, toxins, organ dysfunctions, and emotional dysfunctions in animals. She indicated that by using EDT, she could prescribe various remedies for the animals to cure their determined ailments. Her website contained eleven \"case histories\" for dogs and cats that underwent EDT. AR at 2014. Her website stated that she had successfully diagnosed and treated animals for a severe Candida problem brought on by a vaccine additive, bald spots, motor function after a major bi-lateral stroke, lumps in the groin area, mobility, binge eating, hyperactivity, migraines, back pain, emotional problems, weight gain, and kidney failure. Her website stated that after just one EDT session, a dog's liver enzymes improved dramatically. III. Procedural Facts In 2003, DOH received a complaint regarding Tasker's EDT testing. DOH issued Tasker with a notice of intent to issue a cease and desist order, alleging that Tasker's conduct constituted the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. On January 25, 2006, DOH alleged in an administration action that Tasker engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. Both Tasker and DOH filed for summary judgment. AR 2025. DOH held a hearing before an ALJ who denied Tasker's motion for summary judgment, granted DOH's motion for summary judgment, and issued an order for Tasker to cease and desist her EDT practices in Washington State. It found that Tasker engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine and ordered her to stop offering to use any instrumentality, including an EDT device, to diagnose, treat, assess, test, or identify any human or animal disease, ailment, injury, deformity, pain, or other mental or physical condition of humans or animals. It also ordered her to cease and desist from prescribing or administering any drugs or medicinal preparations, including homeopathic remedies or tinctures for humans or animals. It fined her $10,000 for engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. Tasker appealed the ALJ's decision to the superior court. She argued pro se that (1) the EDT device is approved for safe use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is not harmful to humans or animals, and she cannot be cited for unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine without a showing of harm; (2) the ALJ's decision violated her constitutional right to equal protection because DOH was unfairly targeting EDT testing; and (3) the State of Washington cannot regulate conduct on tribal land and that her EDT testing occurred on tribal land and was outside DOH jurisdiction. DOH argued that even absent any actual demonstration of harm, Tasker still engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine and that her practices are therefore per se harmful. DOH asserted that the FDA approved the safe use of the EDT device for biofeedback to help patients relax during mental health counseling, but not for the type of testing that Tasker engaged in. DOH conceded that there was no evidence that Tasker actually caused harm to any of her clients, but it argued that engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine is per se harm to the public. DOH asserted that Tasker's unlicensed practices caused harm because (1) her clients may avoid consulting a licensed medical doctor after receiving her care, (2) Tasker might provide improper advice to her clients, and (3) Tasker might defraud her clients by charging fees for her services. DOH argued that even if there was no evidence of actual harm, proof of harm is not required to support a finding of unlicensed medical practice and that RCW 18.120 does not apply. DOH argues that RCW 37.12.020 grants DOH jurisdiction over Tasker's practices even if Tasker is conducting her EDT testing on tribal land. The trial court affirmed the Board's decision. It concluded that substantial evidence supported the ALJ's conclusion that Tasker was engaged in the \"practice\" of medicine and veterinary medicine. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 34. It found that she did not use the EDT devices for biofeedback, as the FDA permitted, but that she used it to actually diagnose human and animal ailments. The court explained that Tasker conducted EDT testing, diagnosed problems, and then advised her clients to follow a regime or prescribed course of action. The court noted that Tasker told a client to cease taking medications that a licensed medical doctor prescribed and to follow a different regime she prescribed. The court found that Tasker's practices posed a danger to public health and well being because an individual might forego advice from a licensed medical professional and instead follow Tasker's regime. It found that Tasker's practices easily met the definition for unlicensed practice of medicine in RCW 18.71.011 and veterinary medicine in RCW 18.72.070. It found that Tasker's rights to equal protection were not violated and that there was also no issue regarding jurisdiction. Tasker now appeals. ANALYSIS The Washington Administrative Procedure Act (WAPA) governs judicial review of a final administrative decision. Ch. 34.05 RCW. When reviewing a final administrative decision, we sit in the same position as the trial court and apply the WAPA standards directly to the record before the agency. Tapper v. Employment Sec. Dep't, 122 Wn.2d 397, 402, 858 P.2d 494 (1993). The burden of demonstrating the invalidity of the agency's action is on the party asserting invalidity; here the burden is Tasker's to demonstrate that the ALJ's decision was not valid. RCW 34.05.570(1)(a). We review questions of law de novo but accord substantial weight to the agency's interpretation of the statutes it administers. Superior Asphalt v. Dep't of Labor and Indus., 112 Wn. App. 291, 296, 49 P.3d 135 (2002). We independently determine the law on mixed questions of law and fact and then apply it to the facts as the agency found. Hamel v. Employment Sec. Dep't 93 Wn. App. 140, 145, 966 P.2d 1282 (1998). I. Statutory Interpretation of RCW 18.71.011 Tasker asserts many arguments in this appeal, but her main argument concerns interpreting and applying statutes and regulations. Tasker argues that RCW 18.120.010 requires proof that an unregulated practice can clearly cause harm or endanger the public before the State may impose regulations. Additionally, Tasker argues that she did not engage in practicing medicine because the EDT device is like a scale used to measure body weight or a thermometer used to measure body temperature. She explains that the EDT device merely measures electrodermal signals in the body. Finally, Tasker argues that the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries provides compensation for biofeedback treatment from the same device that she used for EDT and that her testing therefore cannot be harmful. She asserts that biofeedback testing is a well-recognized and safe practice. Statutory construction is a question of law that we review de novo. Pasco v. Pub. Employment Relations Comm'n, 119 Wn.2d 504, 507, 833 P.2d 381 (1992). We look to the statute's plain language in order to fulfill our obligation and give effect to legislative intent. Lacey Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue, 128 Wn.2d 40, 53 905 P.2d 338 (1995). When faced with an unambiguous statute, we derive the legislature's intent from the plain language alone. Waste Mgmt. of Seattle, Inc., v. Util. 621, (1994). We begin with the statute's plain language and ordinary meaning, but we also look to \"the applicable legislative enactment as a whole, harmonizing its provisions by reading them in context with related provisions and the statute as a whole.\" Quadrant Corp. v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd., 154 Wn.2d 224, 238-39, 110 P.3d 1132 (2005). The statutes involved here are clear on their face. Title 18 RCW concerns \"Businesses and Professionals\" in Washington. Chapter 18.71 medicine;\" and chapter 18.130 RCW sets out the Uniform Disciplinary Act (UDA) for health professional regulations under Title 18 RCW. Chapter 18.71 RCW was first adopted in 1955. RCW 18.71.003(4). It defines the \"practice of medicine:\" A person is practicing medicine if he does one or more of the following: (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any means or instrumentality; (2) Administers or prescribes drugs or medicinal preparations to be used by any other person; (3) Severs or penetrates the tissues of human beings; (4) Uses on cards, books, papers, signs or other written or printed means of giving information to the public, in the conduct of any occupation or profession pertaining to the diagnosis or treatment of human disease or conditions the designation \"doctor of medicine\", \"physician\", \"surgeon\", \"m.d.\" or any combination thereof unless such designation additionally contains the description of another branch of the healing arts for which a person has a license: PROVIDED HOWEVER, That a person licensed under this chapter shall not engage in the practice of chiropractic as defined in RCW 18.25.005. RCW 18.71.011 (emphasis added). RCW 18.92.010 defines the practice of veterinary medicine: Any person shall be regarded as practicing veterinary medicine, surgery and dentistry within the meaning of this chapter who shall, within this state, (1) by advertisement, or by any notice, sign, or other indication, or by a statement written, printed or oral, in public or private, made, done, or procured by himself or herself, or any other, at his or her request, for him or her, represent, claim, announce, make known or pretend his or her ability or willingness to diagnose or prognose or treat diseases, deformities, defects, wounds, or injuries of animals; (2) or who shall so advertise, make known, represent or claim his or her ability and willingness to prescribe or administer any drug, medicine, treatment, method or practice, or to perform any operation, manipulation, or apply any apparatus or appliance for cure, amelioration, correction or reduction or modification of any animal disease, deformity, defect, wound or injury, for hire, fee, compensation, or reward, promised, offered, expected, received, or accepted directly or indirectly; (3) or who shall within this state diagnose or prognose any animal diseases, deformities, defects, wounds or injuries, for hire, fee, reward, or compensation promised, offered, expected, received, or accepted directly or indirectly; (4) or who shall within this state prescribe or administer any drug, medicine, treatment, method or practice, or perform any operation, or manipulation, or apply any apparatus or appliance for the cure, amelioration, alleviation, correction, or modification of any animal disease, deformity, defect, wound, or injury, for hire, fee, compensation, or reward, promised, offered, expected, received or accepted directly or indirectly; (5) or who performs any manual procedure for the diagnosis of pregnancy, sterility, or infertility upon livestock; (6) or who implants any electronic device for the purpose of establishing or maintaining positive identification of animals. RCW 18.92.010 (emphasis added). DOH has authority to investigate complaints, issue cease and desist orders and injunctions, and impose penalties on unlicensed persons of a profession. RCW 18.130.190(1). Recently, in State v. Pac. Health Ctr., Inc. (PHC), Division I of this court held that alternative health care providers were engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine when they conducted EDT testing and, based on the imbalance detected during EDT, recommended and provided various remedies, including dietary changes, nutritional supplements, homeopathic mixtures, and herbs. 135 Wn. App. 149, 168-69, 143 P.3d 618 (2006). The PHC website explained that PCH employees could help with a variety of conditions, including high cholesterol, allergies, and immune deficiencies. The court held that because PHC employees offered services to people with various afflictions, told them they could help them feel better, represented that they could help people with physical conditions on their website, used EDT to test for alleged \"deficiencies\" and then sold clients remedies intended to help relieve or cure those conditions, they engaged in the practice of medicine as defined in RCW 18.71.011. Pac. Health Ctr., Inc., 135 Wn. App. at 165-66. The court stated: Using EDT as an instrumentality to determine, or \"diagnose,\" medical conditions in a patient and then recommending and selling specific remedies to that person to address those conditions, are practices that unquestionably fall within the valid police power the legislature exercised when it regulated the practice of medicine. Pac. Health Ctr., Inc., 135 Wn. App. at 166-67. The court held that, although alternative health care provider's terminology may differ from that of mainstream Western medicine, they nonetheless offered to \"diagnose\" physical conditions by analyzing energy levels, and then they provided remedies to \"treat\" those conditions and were engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine under RCW 18.71.011. Pac. Health Ctr., Inc., 135 Wn. App. at 166. Tasker also offered to diagnose conditions using EDT testing. Tasker used the numerical reading from her EDT device to determine if a client was \"balanced,\" suffered from inflammation of the organ associated with the \"meridian\" being tested, or suffered from \"organ stagnation and degeneration.\" AR at 2008. She stated on her website that the energy flow measured by her EDT device carries \"information about internal organs that can be used in diagnosis.\" AR at 2009. Like in Pac. Health Ctr., Inc., Tasker used the information obtained from her EDT device to evaluate and identify a client's medical illnesses or conditions through their \"energy signature\" and would created a tincture based on the EDT readings and her evaluation. AR at 2010-11. We hold that the ALJ did not err in concluding that Tasker was engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. Tasker argues that the ALJ wrongly found that she engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine without demonstrating harm to the public under RCW 18.120.010. But RCW 18.120.010 does not apply. It provides that: Purpose\u2014Criteria (1) The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the regulation of health professions not licensed or regulated prior to July 24, 1983, and those licensed or regulated health professions which seek to substantially increase their scope of practice: PROVIDED, That the provisions of this chapter are not intended and shall not be construed to: (a) Apply to any regulatory entity created prior to July 24, 1983... RCW 18.120.010(1) (emphasis added). DOH is correct that this statute does not apply here because it applies only to the regulation of health professions not licensed or regulated before July 24, 1983; the practice of medicine and veterinary medicine were both regulated prior to 1983. See RCW 18.71.003(4) and RCW 18.92.010. In Pac. Health Ctr., Inc., the court did not require DOH to demonstrate actual harm\u2014it was enough to demonstrate that PHC employees engaged in practices that met the statutory definition for the practice of medicine. We follow Pac. Health Ctr., Inc. and similarly hold that Tasker engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine when she engaged in EDT testing. Tasker is correct that WAC 296-21-280 provides that the Department of Labor and Industries will authorize biofeedback treatment for certain conditions under an industrial insurance claim. But she does not use the EDT device for biofeedback and she is not appealing from a compensation denial for an industrial insurance claim; therefore, WAC 296-21-280 does not apply here. II. Constitutional Arguments Tasker argues that RCW 18.71.011 is unconstitutionally vague as interpreted by the ALJ because it could regulate conduct that the legislature did not intend to regulate. Tasker gives only passing treatment to her constitutional vagueness argument. Other courts have found that \"practice of medicine\" is not unconstitutionally overbroad. See People v. Rogers, 249 Mich. App. 77, 90, 641 N.W. 2d 595 (2001); State v. Hoffman, 733 P.2d 502 (Utah 1987). Tasker's EDT activity clearly falls within the \"practice of medicine,\" as defined by RCW 18.71.011 and the legislature's intent. Tasker's vagueness argument is without merit. Tasker argues that the cease and desist order violates her First Amendment right of free speech. It was not Tasker's claims about EDT that were regulated. Rather, Tasker's conduct was regulated when she offered and actually treated people and animals. Statutes that \"regulate behavior, as opposed to speech, will not be overturned unless the over breadth is real and substantial in relation to the conduct legitimately regulated by the statutes.\" State v. Riles, 135 Wn.2d 326, 346, 957 P.2d 655 (1998). Tasker failed to show any real over breadth of RCW 18.71.011 when applied to her unlicensed EDT practice. Tasker's conduct was legitimately regulated as unlawful practice of medicine. Tasker argues that the lack of notice that she violated RCW 18.120.001 violated her due process rights. Tasker provides no authority for her \"takings\" and \"notice\" argument. Generally, without argument and citation to authority, we will not review an assignment of error. RAP 10.3(a)(5); State v. Olson, 126 Wn.2d 315, 320-21, 893 P.2d 629 (1995). Furthermore, applicable case law is contrary to Tasker's arguments. It is a legitimate regulatory expression where the legislature seeks to prevent the inadequately trained and uneducated from practicing in areas in which competency is lacking. Griffith v. Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 23 Wn. App. 722, 730, 598 P.2d 1377 (1979). \"The State may properly condition the right of one to pursue a lawful occupation where it intimately affects the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. This is not a denial of due process or equal protection of the law.\" Id at 731 (quoting 16A C.J.S. Constitutional Law \u00a7 669, at 1072). Tasker does not have a due process right to engage in the practice of medicine. Consequently, there was no due process violation for failing to provide her notice or prohibit her from unlawfully practicing medicine. Tasker's due process arguments are without merit. III. Jurisdiction Tasker asserts that DOH has no jurisdiction over tribal land and that she may use her EDT device on sovereign tribal land. Tasker apparently took her EDT device onto Colville Nation tribal land and conducted her EDT testing on tribal land, in order to deprive DOH of jurisdiction. She asserts that tribal entities have the sole and sovereign power over tribal land. DOH argues that the State of Washington has jurisdiction under RCW 37.12.010 because Tasker does not claim to be a Native American and does not claim to be treating Native Americans on the tribal land. It is a general rule that on tribal lands, States have authority over non tribal members, but tribes have authority over tribal members. See Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130, 102 S. Ct. 894, 71 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982); Mont. v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 101 S. Ct. 1245, 67 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1981). Tasker does not assert or provide any evidence that she is a tribal member and therefore the State still had authority over her while she was on tribal lands. She is incorrect that she evaded state jurisdiction by conducting her testing on tribal lands. IV. Rule of Lenity Tasker asserts that because there are two rational readings of RCW 18.71.011 and 18.120.010, under the rule of lenity, we must read the statute in her favor. She asserts that when a statute is punitive in nature, lenity requires any ambiguity to be resolved in her favor. She asserts that the administrative hearing was a \"quasi-criminal\" proceeding and that the rule of lenity therefore applied. DOH counters that the rule of lenity does not apply here because this is not a criminal proceeding. The rule of lenity applies to both criminal and quasi-criminal statutes. In re Discipline of Haley, 156 Wn.2d 324, 347, 126 P.3d 1262 (2006)( citing Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 498-99, 102 S. Ct. 1186, 71 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1982)). Only where a statute is ambiguous does the rule of lenity apply. See State v. Jacobs, 154 Wn.2d 596, 600-01, 115 P.3d 281 (2005). We need not determine if this proceeding is \"quasi-criminal\" and \"punitive in nature\" because, as discussed above, RCW 18.71.011 and RCW 18.120.010 are not ambiguous; therefore the rule of lenity does not apply. Yousoufian v. Office of King County Executive, 152 Wn.2d 421, 98 P.3d 463 (2004); Jacobs, 154 Wn.2d at 600-01. V. Expert Testimony Tasker asserts that the expert testimonies of Harriet Hall and Linda Crider were improper because neither was sufficiently qualified as an expert. A trial court has broad discretion in admitting expert evidence, and we review a trial court's decision to admit expert testimony for abuse of discretion. Philippides v. Bernard, 151 Wn.2d 376, 393, 88 P.3d 939 (2004). A party may introduce expert testimony if the expert is properly qualified, relies on generally accepted theories, and is helpful to the trier of fact. ER 702; Philippides, 151 Wn.2d at 393. An expert may not testify outside the area of his expertise and he must have a sufficient factual foundation for his opinion. Queen City Farms Inc. v. Cent. Nat'l. Ins. Co. of Omaha, 126 Wn.2d 50, 104, 35144-7-II 882 P.2d 703 (1994). A speculative expert opinion lacking adequate foundation is inadmissible. Safeco Ins. Co. v. McGrath, 63 Wn. App. 170, 177, 817 P.2d 861 (1991). Harriet Hall is a licensed medical doctor, received her M.D. in 1970, and serves on the editorial board of The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. She testified that based on her review and evaluation, Tasker was practicing medicine as defined by RCW 18.71.011. Linda Crider is a licensed veterinarian, received her D.V.M. in 2002, and practices veterinary medicine in Spokane and Mead, Washington. She testified that Tasker's practices meet the definition for engaging in veterinary medicine. Both were qualified and gave opinions within their area of expertise. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Hall's and Crider's expert testimony. We affirm. A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered.

[Hide Full Content](#seven-thousand-nine-hundred-fifty-three) [Regulatory Action against \"Nutritionist\" Joyce Tasker](https://quackwatch.org/cases/ag/wa/tasker/summarymotion/) In 2006, the Washington Department of Health ordered Joyce M. Tasker of Coleville, Washington, to stop practicing medicine and veterinary medicine without a license. The department's motion for summary judgment (shown below) stated that Tasker, who had never held a license to provide any type of health-care, had been using electrodermal testing (EDT) to diagnose a wide variety of problems in humans and animals. Tasker appealed to her local trial court and then to the Court of Appeals, both of which upheld the Health Department's decision. EDT is a bogus procedure based on the notion that health problems can be detected by measuring skin resistance to a tiny electrical current.

STATE OF WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ADJUDICATIVE SERVICE UNIT | | In the Matter of the Unlicensed Practice Joyce M. Tasker || | | | | | | | | | | NO. 04-06-B-1079UR UNLICENSED PROGRAM MOTION MOTION The Department of Health Unlicensed Practice Program (Program) moves for Summary Judgment. The motion is based on the supporting memorandum below. MEMORANDUM I. BACKGROUND A. Procedural History This case started in June 2003 when the Department received a complaint from an Oklahoma physician, George M. Cuka, M.D., alleging that Joyce Tasker was practicing medicine without a license based on information on her website. The website information indicated that Ms. Tasker was offering something known as electro dermal testing (EDT). Dr. Cuka found particularly \"offensive and dangerous\" that Ms. Tasker purported to treat both humans and animals by the same type of testing. Department Investigator, Nick Lorentz, in November 2003 filed an Investigation Report after reviewing the website and contacting Ms. Tasker at her home in Colville. Based on the investigation, the Program in March 2005 filed against Ms. Tasker a Notice of Intent to Issue a Cease and Desist Order (NOI), alleging that she was engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. After receiving two extensions, Ms. Tasker in June 2005 filed a timely request for adjudicative proceeding to contest the NOI. The case is set for hearing on February 14, 2006. The Program and Ms. Tasker have filed cross-motions for summary judgment in an attempt to resolve the case without the necessity of a hearing. B. Electrodermal Testing (EDT) West German physician Reinhold Voll developed EDT in the 1950s. Proponents claim that an EDT device measures the \"body's flow of 'electromagnetic energy' along acupuncture meridian\". Practitioners use the device to \"help select the treatment they prescribe, which usually involve homeopathic products.\" They claim that they \"can determine the cause of any disease by detecting the 'energy imbalance' causing the problem.\" EDT devices typically operate as follows: The device emits a tiny direct electric current... that flows through a wire from the device to a brass cylinder covered by moist gauze, which the patient holds in one hand. A second wire is connected from the device to a probe, which the operator touches to 'acupuncture points' on the patients hand or foot. This completes a low-voltage circuit and the device registers the flow of current. The information is then relayed to a gauge or computer screen that provides a numeric readout on a numeric scale of 0 to 100. According to Voll's theory, readings from 45 to 55 are normal ('balanced'); readings above 55 indicate inflammation of the organ associated with the 'meridian' being tested; readings below 45 suggest 'organ stagnation and degeneration.' The size of the number actually depends on how hard the probe is pressed against the patient's skin. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker claims that she bought her first EDT machine (Orion) three years ago, and then upgraded to a new machine ( [Asyra](http://asyra.com/products.html)) which she now uses in her practice. The manufacturer claims that Asyra is the superior EDT device, and makes many extravagant claims, including: - EDT is \"probably more reliable\" than any other form of allergy testing. - \"In clinical practice\" EDT is \"useful as diagnostic supplements to blood tests, radiographic imaging\" and \"characterizing differences between inflammatory and degenerative conditions.\" - \"The integration of reliable bioelectric medical instruments into the clinical setting augments the ability to rapidly evaluate tissues which are difficult or impossible to assess by conventional test procedures.\" - Studies show EDT gender and age do not \"effect\" EDT results, which is \"important for considering in using these measurements for medical diagnosis.\" - EDT measures the \"first level homeostatic, bioelectrical, influences that control through the automatic nervous system, which is responsible for the equilibrium in the internal systems of the body.\" - Conventional medical tests confirm EDT's ability to diagnose tumors. - \"By measuring electrical resistant over time, EDT devices provide clinicians with a dynamic profile of ... oscillatory patterns, [holding] great promise for the early diagnosis of significant disease states and for earlier and more effective treatments. - EDT research found a \"relation to diagnosed heart disease and electrical resistant of tissues connected through a meridian pathway.\" - EDT has \"shown that acupuncture point bears a direct relationship on the anatomical structure or physiological function in the body.\" - Studies show that EDT is a \"beneficial adjunct\" to a physician in prescribing remedies to their patients. While citing purported scientific studies to support its extravagant claims, the Asyra manufacturer refuses to provide copies of the studies because doing so would be \"far to [sic] time consuming.\" C. Efforts To Prevent Use Of EDT Under the Consumer Protection Act, the State of Washington brought an action in King County Superior Court against EDT practitioner Monte Kline. From clinics in Bellevue and Spokane, Kline used an EDT device to assess clients' health and to prescribe remedies. One of the State's claims was that Kline's use of EDT constituted the unlicensed practice of medicine. On summary judgment, the State in June 2005 prevailed on the claim, and the court enjoined Kline from continuing to use EDT, and fined him $1 million. The Department filed its own injunctive action against Kline in King County Superior Court. The action was consolidated with the Consumer Protection action, and the Court granted the Department's request for an injunction against Kline. The Department also filed an NOI against one of Kline's employees, Patsy J. Mattfeld, who administered EDT. Ms. Mattfeld recently settled the case by agreeing to a permanent cease and desist order and by paying a $2,000 fine. In a filing with the Presiding Officer, Ms. Tasker noted that in 2003 and 2004 the Program failed to take action against two other Kline employees. Ms. Tasker accurately stated in no uncertain terms that her EDT work involves \"exactly the same thing\" as performed by Kline's employees. Thus, the Kline determination directly relates to this case. In May 2004, the Medical Quality Assurance Commission disciplined a Yakima physician, Williams Ames, for using an EDT device to treat allergies since the device was \"inefficacious.\" Additionally, in People v. Rogers, 249 Mich. App. 77, 641 N.W.2d 595 (2001), the court upheld a criminal conviction for practicing EDT without the required medical license. In U.S. v. Century Clinic, 75 F.Supp.3d 1127 (D.C.Nev.1998), the court approved a consent decree to prevent a physician from practicing EDT, and then found him in contempt for violating the decree. Many other regulatory actions have been taken against EDT practitioners. The Program is not aware of any case in which a court or government agency has ruled in favor of an EDT practitioner. Given the one-sided litigation history, in her deposition, Ms. Tasker admits that it would be \"absolutely asinine\" for her to try to defend the merits of EDT. D. Purpose of Unlicensed Practice Law RCW 18.130.190 authorizes the Department to issue Cease and Desist Orders against persons who engage in the practice of various health care professions, including medicine and veterinary medicine, without having a required license to do so. The provisions in RCW 18.30 (Uniform Disciplinary Act) are intended to \"assure the public of the adequacy of professional competence and conduct in healing arts.\" RCW 18.130.010. Licensing is a constitutional \"exercise of the state's police power and is reasonably related to the public health, safety, and welfare\" by preventing the \"inadequately trained and uneducated from practicing in areas in which competency is lacking.\" Griffith v.Department of Motor Vehicles, 23 Wn.App. 722, 730-31, 598 P.2d 1377 (1979). Licensing assures that practitioners providing health care treatment to the public are qualified to practice and adhere to certain standards in conducting their practice. Unlicensed practitioners, of course, are not subject to any regulation. The danger is that unlicensed practitioners will: (1) offer care that is harmful to a customer's health because they lack expertise; (2) cause persons not to seek needed health-care advice from qualified professionals; and (3) defraud customers by providing worthless treatment in exchange for the customer's money. As explained below, all three dangers exist in Ms. Tasker's unlicensed practice of medicine. II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD The Department's Presiding Officer may rule on \"motions.\" WAC 246-10-602(2)(e). The Program brings a Summary Judgment Motion. No statute or rule specifies the criteria for the Presiding Officer ruling on a Summary Judgment Motion. Thus, the Presiding Officer should apply the \"best legal authority.\" WAC 246-10-602(3)(b). The best legal authority is the test in C.R. 57(c), which states that summary judgment should be granted when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" III. ISSUE The issue in this case is whether, in performing EDT, Ms. Tasker has engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. If so, the issue under RCW 18.130.190(3) becomes the language of a Cease and Desist Order and the appropriate amount of a civil fine against Ms. Tasker. IV. ARGUMENT A. A Person May Not Practice Medicine Or Veterinary Medicine Without A License To Do So Ms. Tasker acknowledges that she is not licensed to practice medicine or veterinary medicine. Under RCW 18.71.021, a person without a license may not \"practice medicine,\" as that term is defined in RCW 18.71.011. Under RCW 18.72.070, a person may not \"practice veterinary medicine,\" as that term is defined in RCW 18.72.010. B. Ms. Tasker's \"Disclaimer\" Does Not Exempt Her From An Unlicensed-Practice Violation On her website, Ms. Tasker posts a boilerplate \"disclaimer\" that she is not offering medical care or veterinary care. Nothing in either the medicine (RCW 18.71) or the veterinary medicine (RCW 18.92) statute allows a person to avoid the licensing requirement simply by making a disclaimer. Otherwise, persons could do anything they wanted as long as they said they were not practicing medicine. The licensing requirement would be so easy to avoid that it would become meaningless. Instead, whether Ms. Tasker is practicing medicine or veterinary medicine, within the meaning of the statutes, depends entirely on what she actually does and offers to do. In this case, the Presiding Officer - not Ms. Tasker through a simple boilerplate declaimer - will determine through an examination of the evidence whether her activity falls within the practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. C. Ms. Tasker Is Engaged In The Practice of Medicine Under RCW 18.71.011, the \"practice of medicine\" (for which is license in required) occurs whenever a person: (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise, or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain, or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any means or instrumentality; (2) Administers or prescribes drugs or medicinal preparations to be used by any other person; As discussed below, Ms. Tasker clearly is engaged in activity encompassed by the board language in both subsections (1) and (2) and therefore is \"practicing medicine\" in violation of the law. 1. RCW 18.71.011 Does Not Distinguish Between \"Alternative\" Medicine And \"Traditional\" Medicine. First, throughout this case, Ms. Tasker has insisted that the activity described in RCW 18.71.011(1) does not apply to her EDT practice. First, it is interesting that Ms. Tasker admits she performs \"alternative medicine\" or \"drugless healing.\" Both terms imply that she engages in activity encompassed by RCW 18.71.011(1). The definition plainly does not differentiate between \"alternative\" and \"traditional\" forms of medicine. Instead, the statute covers all activity that fits the description within the broad definition of offering/providing health advice and care. Significantly, RCW 18.71.030 contains 14 different exemptions from the medical licensing requirement, none of which exempt the practice of \"alternative medicine,\" drugless healing,\" or EDT. Clearly, the law does not exempt \"alternative medicine\" from the definition of the \"practice of medicine.\" 2. Ms. Tasker's Website Shows That She Is Offering To Practice Medicine. RCW 18.71.011 defines the practice of medicine to occur whenever a person \"offers\" to engage in the described activity. An \"offer\" may occur even if a person does not actually engage in the offered activity. During the investigation, Ms. Tasker presented the Investigator with a fancy certificate dated September 2001 from the \"Educational Board of The American Institute of Energy\" conferring on her the \"Professional Title of Technician of BioEnergetic Medicine and Electro Dermal Screening.\" Ms. Tasker's title clearly suggests that she practices some form of medicine. More importantly, Ms. Tasker maintained a website advertising her EDT activity. As explained below, the material from the website, as well as the statements made by Ms. Tasker in her deposition, clearly show that she has \"offered\" to practice medicine. On her website, Ms. Tasker explains in very authoritative and medical-sounding terms how EDT works: CEDS is an electrodermal testing device which works by measuring electrical resistance and polarization at meridians. When a cell is injured by infection, toxins, trauma, etc., swelling occurs. This swelling causes a resistance to the flow of electrons across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm of the cell. This can be measured by an ohm meter when the resistance reading in higher than a cell in a health state, it is an indication of inflammation. As cells begin to die, scar tissue, the resistance (impedance) begins to drop until it reaches zero... The meridian energy flow carries with it information about internal organs that can be used in diagnosis. This is the basis is Computerized Electrodermal Screening (CEDS). The device is used in the CEDS is an electrodermal screen device, which works by measuring the electrical resistance and polarization at acupuncture points and meridians. Through these safe, skin-level measurements, it is possible to analyze the bio-energy and bio-information produced by internal organs and systems. CEDS is one of the most thorough, powerful, and promising modern, holistic medical/diagnostic methodologies. CEDS addresses the body holistically for a number of reasons: A standard CEDS examination enables the operator to quickly and safely collect information on 40 different individual systems. In other words, all of the body's individual parts are covered in an examination. The bio-information signal read by CEDS is a very direct and true description of the condition of the body because it is created by the body. The meridian network regulates or at least participates in every time of bodily function, so naturally it is a very good means by which to monitor the function of the whole body. Product testing allows the operator to test any and every type of medication on the individual patient, including those made from herbs, metals, nosodes, or sarcodes. This allows the operator to explore all available treatment. Computerized Electrodermal Screening identified pathogens, toxins, organ, and emotional dysfunctions even before the symptoms manifest. It determines the correct dosage for maximum effect, using dilutions of energy from over 60,000 homeopathic, herbal, diakra, allopathics, & more. CEDS is non-evasive, inexpensive, effective. It is an undispensible tool with which to maintain or achieve health or wellbeing. Our CEDS balancing system is done with the state-of-the-art Orion System. Dog Patch tests and balances more pets with this spectacular technology than any other system in the world. Of course, unlicensed persons legally may simply talk or write about whatever medical theory they want. The unlawful \"offer\" to practice medicine occurs at a precise point: when Ms. Tasker on her website solicits customers to either come to her in person or to mail her samples of their blood or saliva for EDT testing. The cost for the testing is $150 for humans. The unmistakably \"medical\" nature of Ms. Tasker's activity is underscored even further by the health history form that customers fill out prior to testing. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker explains how she diagnoses through EDT. She tests for \"electromagnetic energies\" that are not tested by physicians. According to Ms. Tasker, the test identifies \"electromagnetic signature, the immaterial electromagnetic signature of all kinds in their bodies, whether it's Parkinson's or something else.\" She thinks that these electromagnetic signatures \"pile up in the body\" like \"worms in a computer.\" She concedes that \"it's a very complicated process (that) even the most brilliant physicists do not yet understand.\" She further explains: You know my testing is for electromagnetic signatures. And so if I see the electromagnetic signatures of, let's say a pituitary tumor, then if a person's question is 'could that be physical,' then I would have to tell them what some of the physical indications would be, but it isn't telling them that they have the physical problems. It's just indicating to a person that these are the physical things that they would notice if it was - if it was a physical thing. But I don't know, because I test for electromagnetic signatures. So if a person comes in and they have an electromagnetic signature, and the [EDT] computer says it's the electromagnetic signature as whatever it may be, say porphyria or whatever, then there is an electromagnetic signature match. A critical component of the business is that Ms. Tasker uses the EDT results to prescribe various remedies or \"tinctures\" to improve the client's health. Indeed, EDT practitioners typically use testing as a marketing gimmick to sell remedies. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker attempted to explain the mystifying process of identifying the correct tincture for the customer: Q: Can you describe what a tincture is? A: The tincture is water and alcohol, or it is a commercial homeopathic preparation, and the recording of the electromagnetic field is imprinted into that tincture. Q: The record being? A: The electromagnetic fields that are detected in the client and stored in the computer and then essentially downloaded into a tincture. And the animal is either given that tincture, or the person, if it happens to be a person, takes their own electromatic fields by taking it imprinted into the tincture. Q: Okay. And what is the form that the downloaded energy takes? I mean, how is it imprinted? How does that work as a matter of mechanics or physics? A: It is all\u2014it's all\u2014let me see what would be the right word. All of the signatures are stored, just like all the information in a computer, in zeros and ones. And each electromagnetic signature has its own pattern of zeros and ones, and that's how it's stored onto the computer. And the computer just imprints the frequencies or the force fields of those patterns that are - than come from the client, imprints it into the tincture. Q: And how do you do that? A: I put the\u2014if I'm using a commercial homeopathic, then I put that homeopathic on the DCM. Q: What is that DCM? A: The digital conductance meter. And it would then - the digital conductance meter then detects the electromagnetic fields in the tincture, the prepared homeopathic tincture, the over-the-counter kind you buy at the store. It would detect those electromagnetic field, and the computer would compare those electromagnetic fields to the electromagnetic fields from the client that the stored in the computer. And the closer the match, then that tells me that a tincture, if it's a close match, that a tincture is similar to the electromagnetic fields in the client. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker claims that she \"gives away\" the homeopathic remedies. However, her listing of remedies includes prices. Frankly, it is hard to believe that Ms. Tasker would provide these medications to her customers for free. As an important marketing tool, Ms. Tasker's website contains numerous glowing testimonials from satisfied customers. The most elaborate testimonial comes from \"JM\" in the form of a letter to her doctor. JM states that she underwent 7-8 hours of EDT testing by Ms. Tasker, and learned the following: That I had the energy signatures of Alzheimer's, Epstein Barr virus, Chronic Fatigue syndrome, and amazingly: my brain was burdened by energy signatures of heavy metals, aspartame, formaldehyde, and many other chemicals, including those used in bio-warfare, and Joyce believed, many used in prescription drugs (like HRT, etc.). Ms. Tasker advised JM to discontinue three of her five doctor prescriptions, and instead take eight different homeopathic remedies. Subsequently, Ms. Tasker diagnosed JM with a benign tumor and Parkinson's. According to JM, her homeopathic remedies help her \"with these newly diagnosed problems.\" JM told her physician that she did not want to take her prescriptions because of her Alzheimer's diagnosis and because they were \"poisoning\" her. The website has contained additional testimonials. S.M. had a thyroid condition and stomach pains, and after EDT experienced immediate relief of \"long-term severe cramping.\" For the first time in 30 years, after undergoing EDT, R.G.'s psoriasis does not \"break out\" when he goes off his medication. J.T. was cured of porphyria, chemical sensitivity, and kidney/gall bladder cancer. K.V. suffered from diabetes and a stroke. His physician gave him only nine months to live, but Ms. Tasker \"proved them wrong.\" Her EDT treatment allowed K.V. to gain improved circulation, increased mobility and weight loss, and to discontinue most of his medications. J.R. claims that his physician confirmed the results of Ms. Tasker's \"liver lab workup.\" His dramatically-improved blood-test results are even posted on the website. J.W. experienced better \"oxygen levels.\" After treating her cat, N.B.D. states that Ms. Tasker treated him for a \"really bad\" lymph system and thyroid. L.M. claims that Ms. Tasker's \"Orion balancing\" improved his \"thinking\" and made it easier to walk when he woke in the morning. Ms. Tasker identified L.M.'s \"pituitary tumor\" and then he stopped urinating too frequently because of the \"balancing.\" The treatment also cured L.M.'s multiple chemical sensitivity and his pain \"in the area of the gallbladder.\" Ms. Tasker treated D.B., a seriously-ill cancer patient. She treated S.N., who is bi-polar and apparently was suicidal after having her upper teeth extracted. She treated S.G. for a virus on the optic nerve. Clearly, Ms. Tasker posts these testimonials in an attempt to attract new customers by presenting herself as nothing short of a miraculous healer and as a supplement or alternative to a real doctor. Based on the foregoing information, there is no doubt that Ms. Tasker is \"offering\" to \"practice medicine\" as that term is defined in RCW 18.71.011(1). 3. Ms. Tasker Is Actually Practicing Medicine. The RCW 18.71.011 definition relates to an \"offering\" or \"undertaking\" to practice medicine. The discussion above relates to what Ms. Tasker \"offers\". The evidence further shows that she has \"undertaken\" to practice medicine in the sense of actually conducting the activity. To verify this fact, the Program conducted discovery on Ms. Tasker to obtain her records related to EDT. Ms. Tasker responded that she did keep the names of clients or client records. When pressed, Ms. Tasker produced a sheet of paper with the names and e-mail addresses for seven clients. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker stated that she would not divulge the names of customers whose body fluids she allegedly tested in her car on an Indian reservation on the (mistaken) assumption that doing so allow her to engage in unlicensed practice free from the restrictions of state law. In Prehearing Order No. 12, the Presiding Officer ordered Ms. Tasker to produce (1) client computerized records on all customers and (2) financial records of customer check deposits. Ms. Tasker simply ignored the Order and never produced the material. The record is clear that the Program's right to discovery was substantially thwarted by Ms. Tasker's refusal to provide documents other than a one-page list of seven hand-picked persons who allegedly received her services. It makes a mockery of discovery when one side produces only the evidence that it wants the other side to have. In any event, the Program attempted to contact the seven customers, and was able to contact only two of them. Both were interviewed by the Attorney General's Office. Both were not available to sign a declaration. However, the interviews took place in the presence of an AGO paralegal. Exhibit 18 is a declaration of the paralegal about the two interviews. These interviews confirm that Ms. Tasker has provided medical advice and care. Customer \"A\" had multiple health problems when she contacted Ms. Tasker for help. These problems included Alzheimer's, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, Sjorgrens, autoimmune problems, \"head tumors which showed a network of dead brain cells\", and she was forgetful. She felt she had \"nothing to lose\" by seeking treatment from Ms. Tasker. Her treatment was in-person, and she describes how the \"computer automatically imprints energy into the tinctures.\" \"A\" credits the \"energy infusion that... goes into the tincture\" for her improved health. She states that Ms. Tasker told her that her improved energy was consistent with her EDT that show \"significantly fewer meridians in distress.\" The other customer, \"B\", states that she learned about Ms. Tasker's services through a flyer. Thus, it is now known that Ms. Tasker advertises her services in more ways than just on her website. \"B\" states that she sought help for \"sciatic pain.\" \"B\" sent blood and saliva to Ms. Tasker for testing about four times, and also has appeared in person. According to \"B\", Ms. Tasker has provided \"homeopathic tinctures infused with my own energies.\" She was charged $150 for the \"infusion.\" She states that she \"continues to have a lot of sciatic discomfort\" despite the treatment. Finally, of course, the fact that Ms. Tasker's actually provides services is further validated by the numerous testimonials on her website. 4. Expert Opinion Supports The Program's Allegation That Ms. Tasker Is Practicing Medicine. Exhibit # 19 is a declaration from Harriet Hall, M.D., stating her professional opinion that Ms. Tasker has engaged in the practice of medicine. Dr. Hall bases her opinion on the fact that Ms. Tasker: (1) solicits customers with health problems and offers treatment; (2) interprets test results and identifies illnesses through an \"electronic signature\"; (3) advises customers to follow her advice and provides them with medicinal preparations; (4) conducts follow-up visits and adjusts medications; (5) claims that her customers receive a health benefit from her services; and (6) holds herself out as an \"alternative\" health care provider. D. Ms. Tasker Is Engaged In The Unlicensed Practice Of Veterinary Medicine. The NOI also alleges that Ms. Tasker has engaged in the unlicensed \"practice of veterinary medicine.\" The issue is whether Ms. Tasker's activity falls within the RCW 18.92.010 definition of the practice of veterinary medicine. 1. Ms. Tasker's Activity Falls Within The Practice of Veterinary Medicine As Defined By RCW 18.91.010(1). RCW 18.92.010(1) states that the practice occurs whenever a person: By... statement... represents his or her ability or willingness to diagnose or prognose or treat diseases, deformities, wounds, or injuries of animals. On her website, as discussed above, Ms. Tasker offers EDT services. According to the website, Ms. Tasker's services are available for animals, as well as for humans. Ms. Tasker makes no attempt to differentiate between them, except that she charges less for animal testing ($115) than for human testing ($150). As with humans, Ms. Tasker posts testimonials on her website related to her health-care treatment of animals in order to entice new customers. She states or implies that she has diagnosed/treated cats and dogs for a variety of conditions, including: (1) \"Severe candida problem brought on by Thimersal (Vaccine Additive) (Tasha); (2) Growing hair on bald spots \"motor function\" after a \"major bi-lateral a \"lump in the groin area (Finnigan); (5) Improved mobility (Finnigan); (6) Weaned off codeine (Finnigan); (7) Binge eating (Mia); (8) Hyperactivity (Mia); (9) Improved liver enzymes (Shasta); (10) Improved disposition (Katie); (11) Restored health (Ella); (12) Migranes (Gabe); (13) Back pain (Gabe); (14) Emotional Problems (Gabe); (15) Restored energy (Kaiya); (16) Weight gain (Emerald); and (17) Kidney failure (Emerald). Based on the information on her website, it is clear that Ms. Tasker made statements of her \"ability and willingness to diagnose or treat animal diseases.\" Thus, her activity constitutes the \"practice of veterinary medicine\" as defined by RCW 18.92.010(1). 2. Ms. Tasker's Activity Falls Within the Practice of Veterinary Medicine As Defined By RCW 18.92.010(3)-(4). RCW 18.92.010 states that the \"practice of also means to: (3) ... diagnose or prognose animal diseases, deformities, defects, wounds, or injuries, for hire... (4) ... prescribe or administer any drug, medicine, treatment, method or practice, or apply any apparatus or appliance for the cure, amelioration, correction, or modification of any animal disease, deformity, defect, wound or injury, for hire... Clearly, Ms. Tasker's offer of services, as described above, meets the criteria of this statute, The question is whether Ms. Tasker is actually conducting a service described in subsections (3) and (4) actually conducting the service that she offers to provide. In her deposition, although not disclosing names of owners, Ms. Tasker admits she has tested up to 50 pets. In her declaration, Ms. Collier states that Ms. Tasker tested her dog's blood and saliva. The testimonials also prove that Ms. Tasker has treated animals for a variety of health issues. The Asyra manufacturer indicates that testing in done on humans rather than on animals. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker explained that when she sees an animal, the testing is performed by placing the probe in the hand of the owner, who acts as a \"surrogate for delivering the animal's electromagnetic fields into the computer. The other question related to the applicability of subsections (3) and (4) is whether Ms. Tasker is charging for her services, as the services must be \"for hire.\" As stated, Ms. Tasker advertises her animal testing for $115. 3. Expert Opinion Supports the Program's Allegation That Ms. Tasker Has Engaged in the Practice of Veterinary Medicine. Exhibit 20 is a declaration by Linda Crider, DVM, stating her professional opinion that Ms. Tasker has engaged in the practice of veterinary medicine. Dr. Crider stresses that Ms. Tasker purports to treat animal health problems that commonly are treated by veterinarians, and does so through a method (EDT) that has no proven validity, thereby jeopardizing the health of animals she treats. E. Ms. Tasker May Not Conduct Her Unlicensed Activity Under The Guise Of Conducting Biofeedback. In her deposition, Ms. Tasker claimed that she simply uses EDT as a \"biofeedback\" device in order to \"relax\" the customer. It is true, as explained by Dr. Hall, that some EDT machines are Class II FDA-approved devices for biofeedback use. As further explained by Dr. Hall, biofeedback is a legitimate form of therapy used by many licensed health care professionals. According to Dr. Hall, the device measures \"galvanic skin responses,\" and the results may assist trained therapists in improving a patient's health by helping them to learn to \"modify their physiological process over time.\" However, no information on Ms. Tasker's website even implies that she offers biofeedback services. More importantly, as Dr. Hall states, biofeedback simply does not remotely involve identifying \"electromagnetic signatures\" in order to assess a person's health and then to prescribe homeopathic medicines. What Ms. Tasker does is patently not biofeedback. Ms. Tasker's claim to be offering biofeedback is completely disingenuous. In reality, Ms. Tasker uses her galvanic skin response device in a manner not intended by the FDA when it approved the device. In any event, Ms. Tasker lacks the qualifications and the licensure necessary to treat patients through biofeedback. Of course, simply because a device is FDA-approved for a specific purpose does not mean anyone (licensed or not) may use the device. V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF A. Cease And Desist Order RCW 18.130.190(3) allows the Presiding Officer to enter a Cease and Desist Order upon a final determination that a person \"has engaged or is engaging in unlicensed practice.\" Based on the foregoing, the Presiding Order should enter a Cease and Desist Order based on a determination that Ms. Tasker has engaged in the unlicensed practice of medicine and veterinary medicine. If the Presiding Officer determines to issue a Cease And Desist Order, the issue becomes identification of exactly what activity Ms. Tasker should be prohibited from doing. In considering this issue, the Program submits that the Presiding Officer should consider the King County Superior Court Kline case. As previously stated, the Department applied for an injunction against Kline. The allegations in the injunctive application show that Kline's activity closely mirrored Ms. Tasker's activity: both were using EDT to diagnose conditions and to prescribe medications. In fact, as previously pointed out, Ms. Tasker has accurately observed that she does \"exactly the same thing\" as Kline's employees. In granting the Department's application for injunction, the Court imposed the strict conditions set forth in the Partial Summary Judgment Order obtained by the State in the Consumer Protection Action. The Presiding Officer should do likewise for Ms. Tasker. Below in italics is the Program's recommended language. Joyce Tasker is prohibited from doing the following within the State of Washington, including on Indian reservation land: 1. Without obtaining a license to practice medicine under RCW 18.71: a. Offering (through verbal or written statements, a website, flyer, or any other means) to use or using on a person any instrumentality (including any type of galvanic skin response or EDT device) in order to diagnose, treat, assess, test for or identify any human disease, ailment, injury, deformity, pain, or other condition, physical or mental, real or imagined This prohibition shall include, but not be limited to, using an instrumentality in order to identify pathogens, toxins, organ or emotional dysfunctions, \"energy imbalances\", or \"electromagnetic signatures\" within a human body. The prohibition applies whether or not the service is offered or performed in return for compensation. (This language prohibits Ms. Tasker from conducting activity within the scope of RCW 18.71.011(1).) b. From offering any service prohibited under Paragraph 1 in order to prescribe drugs or medicinal preparations, including, but not limited to, homeopathic remedies. This prohibition applies whether or not the medications are offered or provided in return for compensation. (While this language covers activity prohibited by Paragraph 1, it also expressly prohibits Ms. Tasker from conducting activity within the scope of RCW 18.71.011(2).) 2. Without obtaining a license to practice veterinary medicine under RCW 18.92: a. Offering (through verbal or written statement a website, flyer, or any other means) to use on any animal any instrumentality (including any type of galvanic skin response or EDT device) in order to make known or pretend her ability or willingness to diagnose, prognose, or treat diseases, defects, wounds, or injuries of animals This prohibition shall include, but not be limited to, using an instrumentality to identify pathogens, toxins, organ or or \"electromagnetic signatures\" within an animal's body.. This prohibition applies whether or not the service is offered in return for compensation (This language - relating strictly to offers - prohibits Ms. Tasker from conducting activity within the scope of RCW 18.92.010(1)-(2).) b. Prescribing or administering any drug, medicine (including homeopathies), treatment, method, or practice, or perform or conduct any operation, or manipulation, or applying any apparatus or appliance (including any type of galvanic skin response or EDT device), or diagnosing or prognosing, for the cure, alleviation, correction, or modification of any animal disease, deformity, defect, wound or injury. This prohibition shall include, but not be limited to, using any method or device to identify pathogens, toxins, oral or emotional dysfunctions, \"energy imbalances\", or \"electronic signatures\" within an animal's body. This prohibition does not apply if the service is performed without any direct or indirect compensation. (This language - relating strictly to actually providing services - prohibits Ms. Tasker from conducting activity within the scope of RCW 18.92.010(3)-(4).) 3. Otherwise engaging in any other activity which constitutes the unlicensed practice of a health care profession in violation of RCW 18.130.190. B. Civil Penalty In addition to entry of a Cease and Desist Order, RCW 18.130.190(3) authorizes the Presiding Officer to \"impose a civil fine in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars for each day upon which the person engaged in unlicensed practice.\" Ms. Tasker became \"certified\" in 2001. She admits acquiring the Orion device in 2002. She has maintained a website advertising her services since at least 2003 when the Department received the complaint against her. She admits to having offered and provided services to humans and animals. Under the statute, the maximum penalty is $365,000 for each year of operation. The Program requests a far lower fine of $10,000 against Ms. Tasker, with $3,333 suspended on condition that she timely pay $6,667 and refrain from any future unlicensed-practice violation. The Program believes that the fine should be paid within sixty (60) days, unless the Presiding Officer \"for cause\" allows Ms. Tasker to make installment payments over a reasonable period of time. The recommended amount of the fine is by no means too large for the following reasons: 1. Ms. Tasker engaged in the violation for a long period. Her \"certificate\" indicates that she started EDT in 2001. 2. The $10,000 fine is far less than allowed under law. 3. Ms. Tasker's violations were egregious, as her website made sweeping and unsupportable claims about her ability to treat humans and animals, and she specifically targeted people who were very ill. 4. Ms. Tasker in fact did treat people with very serious illnesses. 5. Ms. Tasker, as shown in JM's case, advised customers to follow her medication advice over the advice of their licensed physicians. 6. Ms. Tasker used a device that the Medical Quality Assurance Commission has found inefficacious. It hard to believe that Ms. Tasker actually believes the device, given her choice not to defend EDT on the merits and given her admission that she does not understand how it works. The fact that EDT is not a legitimate health-care device is a factor favoring imposition of a high penalty against Ms. Tasker. 7. Ms. Tasker undertook to treat ill people even though she has no health-care degree or work experience. 8. Ms. Tasker charged for her services. 9. Ms. Tasker ignored the Presiding Officer's order to produce patient records and financial records. 10. While it is not known how many customers she has tested - she refuses to say - Ms. Tasker in fact aggressively marketed her business. The evidence is that at the very least she maintained an elaborate website and distributed flyers. 11. The fine will provide a measure of just punishment and hopefully serve as a deterrent to Ms. Tasker and to other unlicensed EDT practitioners who may be operating in the state. Deterrence would not be achieved if the civil fine is so low that it is nothing more than a \"slap on the wrist.\" 12. It is a very serious violation of the law when an unlicensed and totally unqualified person, like Ms. Tasker, undertakes to treat seriously-ill people since sickness or death could result. Her conducts deserves a substantial fine. VI. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Unlicensed Practice Program respectfully requests the Presiding Officer grant its motion for summary judgment, as material facts are not in dispute and the Program is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. What makes this case particularly appropriate for summary judgment is that factually the Program's motion relies on material from Ms. Tasker's website and on statements from her deposition. Hence, there are no material facts in dispute. As the court recognized in Kline, the issues involved in unlicensed EDT practice are susceptible to resolution on summary judgment against the practitioner. In granting the summary judgment, the Program respectfully requests that the Presiding Officer enter the recommended Cease and Desist Order and impose the recommended fine.

[Hide Full Content](#seven-thousand-nine-hundred-fifty-four) [Appeals Court Issues Mixed Ruling in Kline Case](https://quackwatch.org/cases/ag/wa/kline/appeal/) The Washington Court of Appeals has issued a mixed ruling (shown below) in the case of Monte Kline and his clinics. In 2005, a King County Superior Court Judge ordered Kline, who prescribed dietary supplements and other products based on the results of electrodermal testing (EDT), to pay nearly $2 million in penalties and attorneys fees for violating the State of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The judge also ruled that Kline and Pacific Health Center (PHC), of Bellevue, Washington, were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture without a license and ordered them to stop doing so. The Appeals Court concluded: We agree with the trial court's ruling that, although the defendants use alternative practice methods and terminology, their actual practices fall under the statutory definitions ... The Washington Court of Appeals has issued a mixed ruling (shown below) in the case of Monte Kline and his clinics. In 2005, a King County Superior Court Judge ordered Kline, who prescribed dietary supplements and other products based on the results of electrodermal testing (EDT), to pay nearly $2 million in penalties and attorneys fees for violating the State of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The judge also ruled that Kline and Pacific Health Center (PHC), of Bellevue, Washington, were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture without a license and ordered them to stop doing so. The Appeals Court concluded: We agree with the trial court's ruling that, although the defendants use alternative practice methods and terminology, their actual practices fall under the statutory definitions of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. But practicing any of these disciplines without a license is not a per se CPA violation. The State failed to prove defendants did not have the level of competence they represented to the public or that any member of the public was even potentially injured by their actions. As such, the State did not prove a violation of the Act. Because the State did not prove defendants violated the CPA, the trial court also erred in imposing penalties under that statute. The Appeals Court ruling wiped out the huge penalty award and instead required the state to pay Kline's attorneys fees in defending against the charge that he had violated the Consumer Protection Act. However, Kline subsequently announced that he would close his Bellevue clinic because the \"unlicensed practice\" ruling barred him from doing EDT. IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON |STATE OF WASHINGTON, | PACIFIC HEALTH CENTER, INC., a PUBLISHED OPINION Filed September 25, 2006 AGID, J. \u2014 The trial court granted the State's motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that the defendants violated the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) because their alternative health care practice, based primarily on electrodermal testing, constituted the unlicensed practices of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. The defendants appealed both the trial court's ruling and the penalty it imposed, arguing the award was excessive. We agree with the trial court's ruling that, although the defendants use alternative practice methods and terminology, their actual practices fall under the statutory definitions of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. But practicing any of these disciplines without a license is not a per se CPA violation. The State failed to prove defendants did not have the level of competence they represented to the public or that any member of the public was even potentially injured by their actions. As such, the State did not prove a violation of the Act. Because the State did not prove defendants violated the CPA, the trial court also erred in imposing penalties under that statute. We affirm in part and reverse in part. FACTS Monte Kline and his close corporation, Pacific Health Center (PHC), have operated a health care practice in Washington for over 15 years. They advertise through brochures, radio, the internet, and seminars. Their practice consists primarily of using electrodermal testing (EDT) to detect imbalances in \"Qi\", the Oriental medicine concept of energy flow in the body.1 Essentially, EDT uses a computerized, signal- emitting galvanic skin response (GSR) device to measure changes in electrical conductance at acupuncture points on a person's hands. Based on the imbalances detected during EDT, PHC employees recommend and provide various remedies including dietary changes, nutritional supplements, homeopathic mixtures and herbs. 1Kline explains this energy flow as follows: \"In terms of Oriental medicine theory, there is an assumption that there is an ideal energy flow level on the different acupuncture meridians that correlates with optimum health. And when you have an imbalance which could be characterized as an overenergized or underenergized meridian, that creates a disturbance which . . . ultimately could create a specific health problem.\" On the opening page of their website, PHC asks \"Are you sick & tired . . . of being sick & tired?\" They claim they can help with a variety of conditions, including candida, high cholesterol, allergies, and immune deficiencies. They describe EDT as follows: This revolutionary analysis technique . . . was pioneered by renowned West German physician, Reinhold Voll, M.D. in 1953. Various methods of Electrodermal Testing are currently used by over 40,000 medical doctors in Europe and by an increasing number of health practitioners in the United States. Electrodermal Testing involves taking simple, painless, electrical resistance readings on the surface of the skin at acupuncture points on the finger. The subtle differences in the electrical resistance detected by the sophisticated testing instrument determines specifics such as nutrient deficiencies, food and environmental sensitivities, toxicities, . of various foods, environmental substances, nutrients, toxins, etc. [to] change the skin resistance readings, indicating a 'yes' or 'no' relative to a particular test. These filters, originally in test vials, are now recorded electronically in the computer for simpler testing. The computerized Electrodermal Testing allows the practitioner to test vitamins, minerals, enzymes, herbs, and homeopathic remedies for their \"balancing effect\" on the body, measured by their improving previously poor test readings. Thus, the guesswork of nutritional programs is eliminated. Electrodermal Testing has been described as a method of \"conducting an electronic interview with the human body.\" Not too unlike the electronic measurements of Dr. McCoy of \"Star Trek\" fame, we believe Electrodermal Testing is the health care of the 21st century. PHC offers a money-back guarantee. They also provide clients a form called a \"Superbill\" that lists various \"Diagnostic Categories\" including allergy, P.M.S., fibromyalgia and multiple vitamin deficiencies. PHC's radio program, seminars, and website expressly state that Kline is not a physician or naturopath and that his Ph.D. and expertise are in holistic nutrition.2 They provide prospective clients with a letter stating that PHC is a \"non-medical, complementary health practice\" which primarily uses EDT, which \"measures the body on a different level than conventional medicine tests[.] . . . It is considered an investigational technology. . . . We encourage our clients to have regular physical examinations and appropriate conventional tests from their medical doctor.\" At the first appointment, the client signs a disclosure/authorization form stating that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the GSR device to assess \"nutritional deficiencies, food allergies, the presence of toxins, Candida, Epstein-Barr virus, or weakness of organs or glands.\"3 It also states: I understand that the staff of Pacific Health Center are not medical or naturopathic physicians. I understand that Electrodermal Testing does not fall under state licensure requirements, and the staff of [PHC] function as nutritional consultants, as allowed by law. I do not seek nor have the [PHC] staff offered medical diagnosis, cure, advice, or treatment for any particular disease[,] ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain, or other physical or mental condition. I understand that [PHC] staff will not administer or prescribe any drugs or medicinal preparations. Rather, I understand this program focuses on building health through nutritional balancing, desensitization and detoxification.4 No one at PHC holds any Washington health practice licenses. 2Kline's Ph.D. is a correspondence degree based on a volume of work he submitted over a number of years. 3(Emphasis omitted.) 4(Emphasis omitted.) The State began an action against PHC and Kline on September 29, 2003, alleging violations of the Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW, in three separate counts. Count one alleged appellants made unsubstantiated claims about what EDT could do, count two alleged they misled the public into thinking they were physicians practicing medicine, and count three alleged that the GSR device was deceptive because the FDA had not approved it for their chosen use. On February 7, 2005, the Department of Health (DOH) alleged in an administrative action that PHC and Kline engaged in the unlicensed practices of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. On March 1, 2005, the State amended its complaint to delete the FDA-related count and add three new CPA counts, one for each of appellants' alleged unlicensed practices. DOH's administrative action was stayed, and on August 10, 2005, DOH filed an action for injunctive relief in Superior Court. After the trial court consolidated the State and DOH actions, the State moved for partial summary judgment on the three alleged unlicensed practice-related CPA violations. At the hearing on the State's motion, the State said it was not asking the court to decide whether EDT was a valid modality, but only whether appellants were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and/or acupuncture. The court granted the motion, ruling that appellants violated the CPA by engaging in the unauthorized practices of medicine, naturopathy and acupuncture. The trial judge specifically found a violation of the CPA based on the Bowers decision.5 5Bowers v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., 100 Wn.2d 581, 675 P.2d 193 (1983). \"Let me just state also for the record, just so that it's addressed specifically, and anybody reviewing this understands that under Bowers I do believe that this court's determination that there has been a lawyer's practice is a violation of the Consumer Protection Act.\" She said her ruling was a narrow one: I didn't think there were any factual questions as to what the practices of the defendants were. So there [were] no factual questions. The sole question that came before me today is: Are those practices then required to be licensed under the statute? And the three statutory provisions that the State cited were ones, as we all know, governing certain practices, either of medicine, naturopathic medicine or acupuncture. I found those acts, as a matter of law, fall under those statutes. I didn't go further than that. And I honestly don't know what's left of the complaint. She \"found as a matter of law, because of the type of practices, that it was a violation of the Consumer Protection Act. We did not go any further than that in making any determination or assessment about the validity or treatments of these tools or modalities.\"6 The court granted injunctive relief enjoining appellants' unlawful actions, but permitted appellants to operate as nutritionists as allowed under RCW 18.138. It ordered a civil penalty of $1 million and restitution in the amount of $701,630.11.7 On November 29, 2005, the court entered a final judgment amount of $1,997,011.40, including civil penalties, restitution, costs and attorney fees. 6At the end of the hearing, after the parties discussed the proposed order, the court confirmed that she was not ruling on the validity of EDT as a practice method: I never reached the merits of this machine in terms of whether it was effective or not, whether it was science-based or not. That was not the issue. The issue was simply were his practices as he prescribed the materials the unlicensed \u2014 or the practice, frankly, within the three statutes \u2014 are [they] actions that should be licensed under those three statutes? That is the sole basis for the decision. . . . 7The court found appellants had committed 9,426 separate violations within the statute of limitations' allowable period on the State's claim. It awarded slightly more than $100 per violation. On September 30, 2005, the court amended the order specifying the terms of the consumer restitution payment, and on October 11 the court entered an order clarifying that it had granted DOH's request for injunctive relief as part of the original summary judgment ruling. DISCUSSION I. Practice of Medicine, Naturopathy, and/or Acupuncture8 We review summary judgment orders de novo, making the same inquiry as the trial court.9 Summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue about any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.10 We consider all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.11 Questions of fact may be determined as a matter of law when reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion.12 8The State has moved to strike portions of appellant's reply brief, asserting that the \"legislative facts\" appellants cite are not facts at all and this court should not take judicial notice of them. They have no bearing on our decision, so we deny the State's motion to strike. The State has also moved for sanctions under RAP 10.2(i) and RAP 18.9 because PHC mailed its reply brief late. RAP 18.9 provides that we may order a party to pay sanctions for failing to comply with appellate rules. The postal date stamp on the reply brief is April 27, 2006, two days after the April 25, 2006 extended deadline. Appellants argue they put the envelope in the mail on April 26, which was still one day late. But the State does not contend that it was harmed by the short delay, and we decline to impose sanctions for such a minor transgression. 9Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., 146 Wn.2d 291, 300, 45 P.3d 1068 (2002). 775, 698 P.2d 77 (1985) (citing La 85 Wn.2d 154, 531 P.2d 299 (1975); Balise v. Underwood, 62 Wn.2d 195, 381 P.2d 966 (1963)). The first question this court must answer is whether PHC practices medicine, naturopathy, and/or acupuncture as the Washington Legislature has defined those professions. Statutory interpretation and the question whether a statute applies to a particular set of facts are issues of law we review de novo.13 When interpreting statutes, our primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.14 We begin with the statute's plain language and ordinary meaning, but also look to \"the applicable legislative enactment as a whole, harmonizing its provisions by reading them in context with related provisions and the statute as a whole.\"15 If the statute remains susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning, it is ambiguous and we may resort to construction aides.16 13State v. Jackson, 91 Wn. App. 488, 491, 957 P.2d 1270 (1998) (citing State v. Tatum, 74 Wn. App. 81, 86, 871 P.2d 1123 (1994)), review denied, 137 Wn.2d 1038 (1999). 14Quadrant Corp. v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Hearings Bd., 154 Wn.2d 224, 238, 110 P.3d 1132 (2005) (citing King County v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd., 142 Wn.2d 543, 555, 14 P.3d 133 (2000)). 15Id. at 239 (citing King County, 142 Wn.2d at 555, 560). 16State ex rel. Citizens Against Tolls v. Murphy, 151 Wn.2d 226, 242-43, 88 P.3d 375 (2004). In Washington, anyone practicing medicine, naturopathy, or acupuncture must have a valid current license.17 DOH may obtain an injunction preventing a party from practicing without a license.18 To determine whether PHC's practice falls under any or all of the three licensed practices at issue, we have to determine what EDT is and how PHC uses it. Like the trial court, we do not reach the merits of EDT as a health care modality, but instead only consider whether PHC's practice falls under the statutes. client's initial appointment takes about an hour and half and typically costs $395.19 The client fills out a confidential client information form that asks, among other things, what \"health complaints\" the client seeks help with, whether he has seen \"other doctors\" for \"this condition(s),\" and for current and past prescription medications. During the EDT procedure, the client sits across a desk from the \"tester\" who attaches the GSR device to the client and stimulates acupuncture points on the client's fingers with a Piezo stimulator. The tester takes an initial reading with nothing in the circuit, and then adds many different homeopathic dilutions consisting of foods, environmental substances and toxins to the circuit to determine if the client has energy imbalances or blockages. The client holds \"the negative probe (a brass rod) of the instrument while [the] tester touches the positive probe to the [client's] opposite hand. Correct reading is based upon proper location of the acupuncture point, probe angle, probe pressure, probe stroke and smoothness of the reading.\" The tester then adds various nutritional supplements to the circuit \"to determine if they are prone to re-balance or restore energy flows.\" A consultant does the second half of the testing, \"reviewing the client's health concerns, testing Other Disturbances, Energetically Weak Organs, Toxins, checking specific supplements to design a program, and explaining the program to the client.\" Positive EDT readings are recorded in writing on three different forms. There is a $99 follow-up appointment that lasts about an hour and involves all the same testing but does not include all the explanations. 19Our description of PHC's practice, including EDT, is based largely on their responses to the State's interrogatories. Based on the EDT results for a given client, PHC employees fill out an \"Electrodermal Test\" form listing various specific deficiencies, such as vitamins, minerals, toxins and \"other disturbances,\" including depression, stress and autoimmune problems. They fill out a \"Food Avoidance List\" checklist form listing the foods a client should avoid based on his EDT test. They also give the client a \"Supplement Schedule\" listing vitamins, minerals, herbs, digestive aids and homeopathic remedies the client should take based on his EDT results. PHC employees make the homeopathic dilutions themselves and sell clients supplements and homeopathic remedies. A. Practice of Medicine PHC argues the trial court erred by ruling that they practice medicine. Under RCW 18.71.011, a person practices medicine if, among other things, he or she (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any means or instrumentality; [or] (2) Administers or prescribes drugs or medicinal preparations to be used by any other person. No person may practice or represent himself or herself as practicing medicine without first having a valid license to do so.20 The legislature passed Chapter 18.71 as an exercise of the police power to protect the health and well-being of the people of Washington.21 20RCW 18.71.021. 21RCW 18.71.003(1)(2). PHC asserts that they do not diagnose physical or mental conditions when they use EDT to determine the effects of particular substances on a person's energetic balances. They urge us to interpret the statute to exclude holistic, non-invasive health care, contending that a literal interpretation of the statute would cover virtually any service related to the human condition and would nullify related statutes' protections for oriental medicine, herbology, and nutritional counseling. The State argues that PHC's actual practices plainly fall within the statutory definition of practice of medicine. It contends there is no indication the legislature intended to cover only invasive diagnostic and treatment methods used for traditional western biomedical conditions when it regulated medical practice. No cases interpret RCW 18.71.011(1), but an older Washington case provides useful analysis, and several other jurisdictions have grappled with issues similar to ours. In State v. Greiner, the State charged a chiropractor with practicing without the necessary certificate.22 At that time, it was a misdemeanor for any person to practice \"medicine and surgery, osteopathy, or any other system or mode of treating the sick or afflicted in the state of Washington\" without a certificate.23 Grenier had the complaining patient \"remove her street clothing . . . she diagnosed the patient's ailments with the aid of a vibrator; she manually manipulated the supposedly diseased parts; she prescribed a dietary for the patient; she collected a fee; and advised the patient to return for further manipulation.\"24 Grenier argued that her methods were \"adjustments\" rather than \"treatments\" and that chiropractic science was not a subject for State regulation. The court held her explanation was a \"mere play upon words,\" and that chiropractic science was clearly a mode of treating the sick and afflicted. As such it is, by all authority, subject to regulation. To call the method of treatment \"chiropractic\" and the treatments given \"adjustments\" does not change its nature. If the practice has any beneficial purpose at all its purpose is to heal the sick and afflicted, and to regulate the practice of healing the sick and afflicted is unquestionably within the acknowledged powers of the state.25 2263 Wash. 46, 114 P. 897 (1911). 23Id. at 49 24Id. at 51. 25Id. at 51-52. In People v. Cantor, the California Court of Appeals considered whether a hypnotist practiced medicine.26 The relevant statutory components were \"practicing or attempting to do so, or advertising or a holding out as practicing, any system or mode of treating the sick or afflicted, or diagnosing, treating, or prescribing for any ailment, disease, disorder, or other mental or physical condition of any person.\"27 Cantor advertised and told clients he would help with their headaches and weight problems. He tried to hypnotize them, put his hands on their heads in an attempt to relieve their conditions, and gave them instructions for self-hypnosis. He told them he was not a doctor. The court held that the evidence showed the defendant was \"advertising,diagnosing and treating[.]\"28 It further stated: It is our considered opinion that, in the light of the record in this case, the practice of hypnotism as a curative measure or mode of procedure by one not licensed to practice medicine, amounts to the unlawful practice of medicine. While it may be that one day the use of hypnotism may be recognized sufficiently to warrant the Legislature to license that practice, to date it has not done so. To the extent that appellant employed or attempted to practice his hypnotic powers, he was practicing medicine within the meaning of [the statute].29 26198 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 843, 18 Cal. 363 (1961). 27Id. at 845. 28Id. at 849. 29Id. at 850. In People v. Amber, the New York Supreme Court had to decide whether acupuncture fell within the following statutory definition of the practice of medicine: \"diagnosing, treating, operating, or prescribing for any human disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical condition.\"30 Amber argued that acupuncture was a unique treatment method not contemplated by the law and that only \"Western allopathic medicine\" fell within the statute.31 The court described acupuncture in detail based on a treatise provided by the defendant and acknowledged that it was a method and theory quite different from typical western medical treatment. But the court held that \"a statute intended to regulate, limit or control the diagnosis and treatment of ailments must necessarily be broad enough to include the gamut of those known, whether or not recognized and even those not yet conjured.\"32 It stated that it found nothing in the pertinent provisions of the [statute] which exclude, directly or by implication, any manner of diagnosis or treatment which is not embraced within the definition of \"Western allopathic medicine\". . . . Whether actions constitute the practice of medicine is dependent upon the facts and not upon the name of the procedure, its origins or legislative lack of clairvoyance.33 3076 Misc. 2d 267, 268, 349 N.Y.S.2d 604 (1973) (quoting N.Y. Education Law \u00a7 6521). The statute had retained its broad language since it was enacted in 1907. Id. at 269. 31Id. at 273. 32Id. 33Id. Importantly, the court noted that despite the defendant's detailed description of acupuncture, he had scrupulously avoided [ ] the fact that a patient is necessarily involved and that such patient seeks treatment, not out of curiosity but only because he is suffering pain or other physical ailment; that before he, the patient, can expect the anticipated relief from the harmonious workings of the dual forces of Yin and Yang, a diagnosis must be made, if not to recognize a \"Western\" disease, then at least to determine the existence of a disharmony brought about by the disequilibrium of Yin and Yang; that a proper diagnosis or determination necessarily involves an expert ability to palpate the 12 pulses in order to read the condition of the 12 organs and thus determine which of the 12 meridians must be used to convey the Yin and Yang to the seat of disharmony with the object of restoring the vital essence of \"ch'i\", which is described as an harmonious mixture of Yin and Yang. . . .34 The court concluded, \"[i]t may be, in fact, that acupuncture as a separately licensed healing modality is an idea whose time has come. It is not, however, for this court to declare its arrival. That task is for the Legislature.\"35 34Id. at 274. 35Id.. at 275. Accord, People v. Roos, 118 Ill. 2d 203, 514 N.E.2d 993 (1987). In People v. Rogers, defendant alternative health practitioner hooked clients up to a Phazx machine, a computer-based machine which used electrical impulses with attachments secured with Velcro.36 The defendant assessed the conditions of various organs based on the machine's readings and recommended various dietary and exercise changes, along with remedies which she sold to the clients, based on the conditions the machine indicated. Michigan defined the \"practice of medicine\" as the \"diagnosis, treatment, prevention, cure or relieving of a human disease, ailment, defect, complaint, or other physical or mental condition, by attendance, advice, device, diagnostic test, or other means, or offering, undertaking, attempting to do, or holding oneself out as able to do, any of these acts.\"37 Rogers argued only that Michigan's statutory definition of \"practice of medicine\" was overbroad and void for vagueness. There was no question her conduct constituted the practice of medicine under the statute. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that previous court decisions had narrowed the statute sufficiently to make it constitutional.38 36249 Mich. App. 77, 641 N.W.2d 595 92 (quoting MCL 333.17001(1)(d)). 38Id.at 101. PHC mentions that there are obvious constitutional issues in this case, but cite the Rules of Appellate Procedure limitations as the reason why they provide no supporting argument. As in these cases, under the plain language of the statute, PHC employees do practice medicine. They offer services to people with various afflictions and tell them they can help them feel better. Appellants maintain that they merely identify and treat energetic, or \"Qi,\" imbalances rather than actual physical or mental conditions. But they represent that they can help people with arthritis, immune deficiencies, high cholesterol, and other physical conditions. They say in their brochure that they can help with \"problems\" such as candida, headaches, depression, PMS, infections, and osteoporosis. They use EDT to test for nutrient and mineral deficiencies, energetically weak organs, toxicities, and food and environmental sensitivities. EDT is the \"means or instrumentality\" they offer and use to find and advise on these conditions. Based on the EDT results, appellants fill out a checklist identifying a client's conditions, not the client's \"Qi\" levels. They then suggest, mix, and sell remedies intended to help relieve or cure those conditions. As appellants describe it, \"Qi\" is inextricably linked with physical and mental conditions. Further, the \"Superbill\" appellants provide clients includes a section titled \"Diagnostic Categories\" that lists various conditions and ailments including allergy, P.M.S., fibromyalgia, and multiple vitamin deficiencies. These conditions are assigned codes that correspond to classification numbers used by medical professionals when billing insurance companies. PHC's terminology may differ from that of mainstream Western medicine, but ultimately they offer and use EDT to determine, or \"diagnose,\" physical conditions or potential conditions, and then they suggest and provide remedies to address, or \"treat,\" those conditions. They may diagnose conditions by analyzing energy levels, but they still diagnose conditions. As the Amber court stated, \"[w]hether actions constitute the practice of medicine is dependent upon the facts and not upon the name of the procedure, its origins, or legislative lack of clairvoyance.\"39As in Amber, PHC's clients, or \"patients,\" come to them for treatment because they suffer pain or discomfort or some other physical or mental manifestation, not because their \"Qi\" is out of balance. Before those clients can obtain the relief expected from a balanced \"Qi,\" PHC employees must make a diagnosis, if not to recognize a \"Western\" condition, then at least to determine the existence of an imbalance brought about by various sensitivities or deficiencies. 3976 Misc. 2d at 273. Nothing supports PHC's view that the statute is intended to cover only diagnoses of serious conditions or invasive biomedical advice. Nor does anything demonstrate that the legislature intended to include only traditional Western medicine practices in its definition of \"practice of medicine.\" We acknowledge appellants' concern that the statute's plain language could allow the State to regulate many practices the legislature could not have intended to regulate, such as elementary school teachers instructing students on health and hygiene or a Pilates instructor advising a client to hold in her stomach to prevent lower back pain. But those situations are not before us. Using EDT as an instrumentality to determine, or \"diagnose,\" medical conditions in a patient and then recommending and selling specific remedies to that person to address those conditions, are practices that unquestionably fall within the valid police power the legislature exercised when it regulated the practice of medicine. PHC argues that even if their actions fall under the plain language of the statute, related statutes and trends in public policy indicate the legislature could not have intended to require that they be licensed.40 They contend the legislature intended that citizens have the freedom to choose alternative medicine practices. The State points out that Washington does so by licensing various \"alternative\" practices, including naturopathy, acupuncture, and massage. As the State argues, the legislature chose to license alternative health care to protect consumers from deceptive or harmful practices. 40Appellants cite various papers and declarations extolling the virtues and validity of EDT. But the validity of EDT is not at issue in this case. RCW 18.71.030 enumerates 14 exemptions to the statute, including some activities which constitute the practice of medicine, such as dentistry and naturopathy, but which may be performed under another license.41 No one at PHC is licensed in any discipline, so this provision does not apply to them. RCW 18.36.050 lists four exemptions from the practice of naturopathic medicine, including the \"practice of oriental medicine or oriental herbology, or the rendering of other dietary or nutritional advice.\"42 But those exemptions only apply to the identified practices and do not exempt other practices, such as EDT, from licensure requirements. The same logic applies to the acupuncture statute, chapter 18.06 RCW, which excludes from acupuncture licensure requirements dietary advice based on oriental medical theory provided it is not given in conjunction with certain listed techniques.43 But, again, PHC is not merely giving dietary advice. PHC also cites the Dietitians and Nutritionists statute, chapter 18.138 RCW, which excludes health food stores from licensing requirements.44 But the same problem arises because PHC is not merely operating a health food store. Simply because some of their practices taken alone, would not require a license, does not mean they may engage in other activities which require \"idea whose time has come is to allow alternative providers to provide health care for those who increasingly want it without being hampered by regulation.\" They point to other states that have enacted legislation allowing alternative providers to practice without a license provided their actions are not invasive. But our legislature has not yet embraced that policy. Even if EDT as a separately licensed, or even unregulated, health care modality is indeed an idea whose time has come, we must leave that decision to the legislature. PHC's actions constitute the practice of medicine under RCW 18.71.011. B. Practice of Naturopathy The legislature passed the naturopathy act, chapter 18.36A RCW, because it found it \"necessary to regulate the practice of naturopaths in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\"45 The legislature defines the practice of naturopathy broadly to include manual manipulation (mechanotherapy), the prescription, administration, dispensing, and use, except for the treatment of malignancies, of nutrition and food science, physical modalities, minor office procedures, homeopathy, naturopathic medicines, hygiene and immunization, nondrug contraceptive devices, common diagnostic procedures, and suggestion . . . .46 Nutrition and food science \"means the prevention and treatment of disease or other human conditions through the use of foods, water, herbs, roots, bark, or other natural food elements.\"47 A license is required to practice naturopathy.48 As noted above, the statute exempts the practice of oriental medicine or herbology, or rendering other dietary practice consists primarily of nutritional counseling and oriental medicine. But they prescribe and mix specific homeopathic remedies based on a specific client's EDT results. They intend that those remedies will prevent and treat the particular conditions EDT indicates are present. They also put together food avoidance lists based on the EDT results. Because they do more than simply recommend homeopathics or render nutritional advice, PHC employees practice naturopathy under RCW 18.36A.040. C. Acupuncture The legislature defines \"acupuncture\" as a \"health care service based on an Oriental system of medical theory utilizing Oriental diagnosis and treatment to promote health and treat organic or functional disorders by treating specific acupuncture points or meridians.\"50 Acupuncture includes, among other things, the \"[u]se of electrical, mechanical, or magnetic devices to stimulate acupuncture points and meridians,\" and \"[d]ietary advice based on Oriental medical theory provided in conjunction\" with certain techniques including electrical stimulation of acupuncture points and meridians.51 Acupuncturists PHC argues they do not practice acupuncture because they do not use EDT to treat anything. They acknowledge that they use a \"Piezo stimulator\" in the EDT process to mildly, non-invasively stimulate acupuncture points and meridians. But because this stimulation merely awakens the points and meridians for measurement purposes rather than treatment, it is not as professional acupuncture. However, the plain language of the statute requires only that the electrical devices \"stimulate acupuncture points and meridians\" to qualify as acupuncture. It does not require that the electrical device actually treat anything.53 PHC employees practice acupuncture under RCW 18.06.010. 53RCW 18.06.010(1)(b). II. Consumer Protection Act The CPA prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices.54 Where there is no dispute about what a party does in its trade or business, whether those actions constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the CPA is an issue of law this court reviews de novo.55 Conduct need not be intentional to be unfair or deceptive aslong as it has \"the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public.\"56 The legislature has explicitly stated which statutory violations are per se CPA violations.57 The unlawful practice of medicine is not a per se violation of the CPA.58 54RCW 19.86.020. 55Robinson v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., 106 Wn. App. 104, 114, 22 P.3d 818 (citing Leingang v. Pierce County Med. Bureau, 131 Wn.2d 133, 150, 930 P.2d 288 (1997); Sign-O- Lite Signs, Inc. v. DeLaurenti Florists, Inc., 64 Wn. App. 553, 560, 825 P.2d 714, review denied, 120 Wn.2d 1002 (1992); Grayson v. Constr. Co., 22 Wn. App. 143, 148-49, 589 P.2d 283 (1978), reversed on other grounds, 92 Wn.2d 548, 599 P.2d 1271 (1979)), review denied, 145 Wn.2d 1004 (2001). 56Bowers, 100 Wn.2d at 592 (citing Haner e.g., RCW 19.190.030(3) (a violation of the Commercial Electronic Mail Act constitutes \"an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce . . . for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act.\"); RCW 19.146.100 (a violation of the Mortgage Brokers Practices Act is a CPA violation); RCW 19.178.110 (a violation of the Going Out of Business Sales Act is a CPA violation); RCW 19.16.440 (collection agencies operating without a license or committing acts prohibited by the governing statute violate the CPA). 58See State v. Schwab, 103 Wn.2d 542, 548-49, 693 P.2d 108 (1985) (violations of statutes promulgated in the public interest do not constitute per se CPA violations) (citing Haner, 97 Wn.2d at 761-63). In Bowers v. Transamerica Title Insurance Co., the Washington Supreme Court held that Transamerica's closing agents' preparation of certain closing documents constituted the practice of law, and that by preparing the documents the closing agents represented that they had the legal competence to do so.59 The court held that [p]otential clients might readily and quite reasonably believe that Transamerica's closing agents were qualified to provide the expertise that could be expected from a lawyer. Such a belief, though reasonable, is not well founded. In fact, the record is clear that the closing agents possessed no such expertise. Transamerica's conduct was therefore unfair and deceptive.60 The Bowers plaintiffs were damaged because Transamerica's unauthorized practice of law induced them to close real estate transactions without consulting legal counsel, who could have informed them of dangers inherent in the transactions.61 59100 Wn.2d 581, 675 P.2d 193 (1983). 60Id. at 592. 61Id. The State maintains that it does not allege a per se violation of the CPA. Rather, it argues that PHC violates the CPA by engaging in practices limited by law to licensed health care professionals. It also contends PHC has the capacity to deceive the public because, like the defendants in Bowers, they engage in practices for which they represent they have the expertise and training that only licensed professionals possess. PHC argues that even if their actions constitute the practice of medicine, that does not necessarily mean what they do has the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public. The trial court relied on Bowers in ruling that PHC violated the CPA. Appellants represented themselves as being skilled in EDT and providing remedies based on EDT results. The State essentially argues that claim alone has the capacity to deceive consumers if the party's actions constitute the practice of medicine. In other words, when an unlicensed entity claims to and does perform some act covered by the practice of medicine statute, he or she is inherently less skilled than was represented to the public. This, the State asserts, is by definition a deceptive practice. But that does not account for people who, although unlicensed, have represented what they do correctly. The State effectively asks this court to adopt a per se rule that any unlicensed person who represents himself as skilled in a health practice modality violates the CPA if that modality constitutes the practice of medicine, regardless of whether his actual skill level matches his representations. That is not what Bowers held. The defendants in Bowers represented that they were skilled in preparing closing documents, which constituted the practice of law, when in fact they were not. The crucial point for our CPA analysis is not simply that they were unqualified to practice law, but rather that the record demonstrated they were, in fact, not skilled in preparing the very closing documents they held themselves out as qualified to prepare. It was not their unlicensed practice of law itself that violated the CPA, as that would be a per se violation, but instead their lack of skill in preparing and advising clients about the meaning of those documents. Here, PHC employees used EDT to diagnose and treat conditions. This constitutes the practice of medicine, but the State has not proved they were in fact not skilled in using EDT. To prove a deceptive practice, the State must demonstrate that PHC employees were not skilled in doing what they represented to the public they could do. Instead, the State relies solely on the fact that appellants were not licensed as proof that they misrepresented their skill level. Bowers is not broad enough to support the State's position. Bowers held that by preparing closing documents, the defendants had represented to the public that they were competent to prepare those documents when they were not. Their false representation of their level of competence was the deceptive practice for CPA purposes, not their unauthorized practice of law. Competence to perform a particular act and being licensed to perform that act are two different things. A party practicing law or medicine without a license does not deceive the public if they do not claim to be licensed and are, in fact, competent or skilled in doing what they represent they can do. Someone who practices law or medicine without a license is not necessarily incompetent to perform the service that constitutes the practice of law or medicine. Under Bowers, the issue is whether that person in fact misrepresented his or her level of competence. PHC represented to the public that they were skilled in EDT and could help people with various problems and maladies. They specifically said they were not medical doctors and did not claim to be licensed to practice any discipline. To prove a CPA violation, the State had to show that PHC employees were not skilled in using EDT or helping people in the manner they represented. This the State failed to do. In fact, the record is replete with evidence that PHC's clients believed its employees were competent at what they did. Further, although the State need not present evidence that PHC's practices actually caused harm, it has failed to produce any evidence that there is even a reasonable possibility of harm. PHC has practiced for over 15 years in Washington. In that time, the State has not received any consumer complaints. Indeed, the only input from citizens has been outrage that the State was prosecuting PHC. The State must at least demonstrate that appellants' actions have a reasonable possibility of causing harm. Because it has not done so, its CPA claim cannot stand. The trial court erred by ruling that appellants violated the CPA. Thus, it also abused its discretion by ordering penalties under the CPA. ATTORNEY FEES We award appellants reasonable attorney fees and costs because they are the prevailing party in the CPA action.62 62 The prevailing party in a CPA action may, in the discretion of the court, be awarded attorney fees and costs. RCW 19.86.040. We affirm the trial court's ruling that appellants engaged in the practices of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. We reverse the trial court's ruling that appellants violated the CPA and its award of penalties under the CPA. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. _________________________ WE CONCUR: _________________________ _________________________ This page was revised on September 5, 2007.

Performance report on Arizona homeopathic licensing board published. The Arizona Auditor General has released it 2007 [performance audit and sunset review](http://www.homeowatch.org/reg/arizona_sunset_2007.pdf) of the Arizona Board of Homeopathic Examiners. The report said that if the state legislature chooses to continue the Board, three steps should be taken to address three issues that limit public protection: - The Board appears to allow conduct that the state medical and osteopathic boards consider unsafe or unprofessional. For example, it has allowed two physicians to continue to practice although their other licenses have been revoked. The Arizona legislature should consider forming a study committee to determine the best way to help ensure that one board's actions do not negate another board's actions. - Consumers may be confused by a physician holding both a homeopathic and a medical or osteopathic license. As a result, they may not know whether the treatment being provided is standard or nontraditional. To ensure that patients know they are receiving nontraditional treatment, the legislature should require homeopathic physicians to obtain informed consent. - The board's name should be changed to reflect the fact that it authorizes acupuncture, chelation therapy, and several other nonstandard practices that have nothing to do with homeopathy. Because the homeopathic board was actually formed to enable maverick physicians to practice dubious treatments, the recommended measures would offer little consumer protection.

DIVISION OF REGISTRATIONS BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS STATE OF COLORADO Case No. CH 2006-0003 FINAL BOARD ORDER IN THE MATTER OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS REGARDING THE LICENSE TO PRACTICE CHIROPRACTIC IN THE STATE OF COLORADO OF TAMEA SISCO, D.C., LICENSE NO. CHR-2835, Respondent. This matter came before the Colorado State Board of Chiropractic Examiners (the \"Board\") for review of the Initial Decision of Administrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer (the \"ALJ\") issued in the above-captioned case on December 26, 2006. That decision is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. On March 5, 2007, the Petitioner filed a Designation of Record. On March 23, 2007, Petitioner filed Petitioner's Exceptions to the Initial Decision. Respondent did not file a Designation of Record. On April 6, 2007, Respondent filed a Response to Petitioner's Exceptions to the Initial Decision. On May 10, 2007, the Board considered the Initial Decision of the ALJ and the subsequent pleadings filed by the parties as noted above. Conflicts Counsel from the Office of the Attorney General was present during deliberations to advise the Board. After consideration of the record as defined in the Petitioner's Designation of Record, the Initial Decision, and the pleadings filed by the parties, the Board unanimously entered its Final Board Order pursuant to C.R.S. \u00a724-4-105, as follows: 1. The Findings of Fact of the ALJ are affirmed and adopted. 2. The ALl's Discussion and Conclusions of Law are affirmed and adopted, except as follows: a. The section entitled \"Sanction\" on pages 9 through 1 \u00b0 is hereby stricken and replaced with the following language: Upon violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7 12-33-117, C.R.S., the Board may issue a letter of admonition, or may revoke, suspend, grant probation on terms and conditions set by the Board, or otherwise discipline a licensee as provided by the Chiropractic Practice Act. Section 12-33-119(8), C.R.S. In lieu of license suspension, the Board may impose a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars. Section 12-33-117(1.5), C.R.S. The Board finds that a sanction of revocation of Respondent's license to practice chiropractic is appropriate. Respondent has engaged in multiple violations of the Chiropractic Practice Act. Respondent practiced outside the scope of practice for a chiropractor by administering IV treatments to her patients at Excel. Respondent's documentation of acupuncture treatments rendered to her patients at Excel was minimal to nonexistent, to the point where she herself could not determine from those records whether acupuncture had been performed. Respondent used her chiropractic license to promote a nonchiropractic enterprise. Further, Respondent has a disciplinary history with the Board. It took Respondent seven years to complete a one-year period of Board-supervised probation. Imposing sanctions is a discretionary function of an administrative agency, and the Board is afforded wide discretion in determining the appropriate sanction. See Colorado Real Estate Commission v. Hanegan, 947 P.2d 933, 936 (Colo. 1997). In determining an appropriate disciplinary sanction, the Board shall first consider sanctions that are necessary to protect the public. See C.R.S. \u00a7 12-33-101, et seq. The Board finds that Respondent's actions exhibit a lack of professional judgment and an inability to be regulated. The Board finds that the number and severity of Respondent's violations of the Chiropractic Practice Act demonstrate a failure and unwillingness to respect or adhere to the generally accepted standard of practice. The Board finds that the sanction of revocation is necessary to protect the public. 3. The paragraph following \u00b7the heading \"Initial Decision\" on page 10 of the Initial Decision is hereby stricken and replaced with the following language: Respondent violated \u00a7 \u00a7 12-33-1 17(1)(b), (t), (w) and (ee), C.R.S., of the Chiropractic Practice Act. For these violations, the Board revokes Respondent's license to practice as a chiropractor in the state of Colorado. THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the license to practice chiropractic of Tamea Sisco, D.C., is REVOKED. This decision becomes final upon mailing. Any party adversely affected or aggrieved by any agency action may commence an action for judicial review before the Court of Appeals within forty-five (45) days after such action becomes effective.

[In the other case](http://www.casewatch.net/doj/stearns_levine/indictment.pdf), chiropractors William Stearns and Steven Levine allegedly used false codes to bill for more than $1.8 million for VAX-D, for which they received more than $1 million. They also billed improperly for more than $1.5 million and collected about $817,000 for use of a Hako-Med device. Hako-Med devices are claimed to provide pain relief by administering electrical impulses to the skin. The indictment states that after Stearns and Levine began using VAX-D, they typically applied Hako-Med after each VAX-D treatment. Levine is also charged with money laundering. In March, [Berkowitz pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $2,450,364 for restitution](http://www.casewatch.net/doj/ascn/berkowitz_plea.pdf). The cases against the others remain pending. In 2006, [two chiropractors received 34-month prison sentences](http://www.casewatch.net/doj/topel/indictment.shtml) for using CPT Code 64722 to improperly collect nearly $2 million from Georgia BlueCross BlueShield. Spinal decompression device manufacturer raided. The Tampa Tribune has reported that FBI agents have raided Florida-based Axiom Worldwide and carried boxes and bags to a large van parked nearby. They said nothing about the investigation or what they were confiscating. [Morelli K. [FBI raids medical supply business](http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/newswire/story/fbi-raids-medical-supply-business/). Tampa Tribune, March 8, 2007] Axiom's flagship product is a back-pain traction device that is similar to VAX-D and promoted with nearly identical claims. Chiropractic board member's credential use questioned. The Sacramento Bee has reported that chiropractor Franco Columbu was ordered in 2004 to stop marketing himself as a Ph.D. in nutrition because his \"credential\" did not come from an accredited school. Columbu, a former bodybuilding champion, was appointed to California's chiropractic licensing board in 2006 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time friend with whom he trained. The Bee also noted that Columbu was best man at Schwarzenegger's wedding. Columbu's \"Ph.D.\" is from Donsbach University, a now-defunct school that was never accredited. [Barrett S. [Stay away from Donsbach University graduates](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/donsbachuniversity.html). Quackwatch, April 12, 2007] Two legislators have urged Columbu and three other Schwarzenegger appointees to resign. [Yamamura K. [Board member still claims Ph.D.: Schwarzenegger friend on chiropractic panel got a cease-and-desist order](http://www.sacbee.com/391/story/153688.html). Sacramento Bee, April 12, 2007] Despite the board's warning, Columbu's Web site continued to mention his \"Ph.D.\" on a page promoting his $200 \"personalized nutrition program.\" However, his entire site was taken down shortly after the Bee article was published. Acupuncture not proven effective for smoking cessation. The Cochrane Collaboration has updated its review of studies that tested whether acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy, or electrostimulation can help people stop smoking by reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. After evaluating 24 randomized trials, the researchers found \"no consistent evidence that acupuncture is superior to no treatment, and no evidence that the effect of acupuncture was different from that of other anti-smoking interventions, or that any particular acupuncture technique is superior to other techniques.\" [White AR and others. [Acupuncture and related interventions for smoking cessation](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab000009.html). Art. No.: CD000009. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000009.pub2] The reviewers also stated that further research is justified because \"there is not enough evidence to dismiss the possibility that acupuncture might have an effect greater than placebo.\" However, such research would be a poor investment of scarce research dollars because (a) the underlying theory is implausible and (b) more cost-effective smoking-cessation methods are available.

Hinson, Esq., 900 17th St., N.W. #900, Washington, DC 20006-2596 INITIAL DECISION This proceeding was initiated on January 11, 1991, when the Postal Service filed a Complaint alleging that the Respondents named in the caption are engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. Specifically, the Complaint, as amended, alleges in paragraph 8 that Respondents falsely represent, directly or indirectly, in substance and effect, whether by affirmative statement, implication or omission, that: (a) SST Super Stories is a talk show that regularly features and reviews products and is not a program length commercial; (b) Oncor is recommended by impartial health professionals who are independent from the distributor of the product; (c) Oncor can cure or treat impotency; (d) Oncor can increase sexual desire in men; (e) Oncor is recognized by the medical community as an effective drug for the treatment of impotency; (k) Oncor is safe and non-habit forming for all users; (m) Oncor is recommended by someone who has no reason to be biased. After the hearing, the Complaint was amended to delete subparagraphs (f)-(j) and (l) as duplicative, and to amend (m) as above. In timely filed Answers, as amended, Respondents deny that they make the false representations alleged in the Complaint or that they have otherwise violated the statute. A hearing was held by the Administrative Law Judge on June 12, 1991, in Phoenix, Arizona. All parties were represented by counsel and afforded full opportunity to be heard, adduce relevant evidence, and examine and cross-examine witnesses. Complainant presented the testimony of Thomas H. Stanisic, M.D, Marvin Dean Crothers, M.D., and Postal Inspector Joseph Beyers. Respondents presented the testimony of John Charles Reed, M.D., Tariq Kuraishy, J. Dudley Chapman, D.O., and Peter Spiegel. All parties presented documentary evidence. Both parties presented additional documentary evidence after the hearing, all of which is rejected as untimely. At the conclusion of Complainant's case, Respondent moved to dismiss and the Administrative Law Judge reserved judgement on the motion and asked Respondent to put on its case (Tr. 109). In view of the conclusions reached herein, the motion is denied. During the hearing, Respondent presented the testimony of Dr. Chapman concerning a study that he conducted. However, Respondent did not notify Complainant of this study prior to the hearing in accordance with the Order requiring prehearing witness summaries. Accordingly, that testimony is hereby stricken. (It is also noted that Respondents TWP and the McIlvennas replied to Complainant's pretrial discovery request for medical studies by saying the latter were \"irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\") Notwithstanding this ruling, all of Chapman's testimony has been considered by the Administrative Law Judge in making this decision, and it does not change the result reached herein. On August 9, 1991, the parties filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law which have been duly considered. To the extent indicated below, proposed findings and conclusions have been adopted; otherwise, they have been rejected as irrelevant or contrary to the evidence. The findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below are based on the entire record herein, including observation by the Administrative Law Judge of the witnesses and their demeanor, the briefs, stipulations, exhibits, and other relevant evidence adduced at the hearing: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. P.O. Box 29012, Phoenix, AZ is controlled by Respondent Sergio and Spiegel Television for Oncor, Inc. (\"SST\"), a direct response advertising agency (Stip., Tr. 7-8). SST is a Nevada corporation with a registered office at 821 Riverside Drive, Reno, Nevada 89503 and a business address of 2714 Pico Boulevard, Suite 200, Santa Monica, CA 90405 (Complaint ##2, 3; SST Ans.). 2. Peter Spiegel is the chief executive officer of SST (Tr. 227). Mr. Spiegel and his partner, William Sergio, specialize in the production of program length television commercials known as \"infomercials\" (Tr. 227-229, CX-7). Respondent William Sergio is both a director and president of SST. Messrs. Sergio and Spiegel direct and control the activities of SST (Compl. #3; SST Ans.). 3. Taylor-Wright Pharmacals, Inc. (\"TWP\") is a Delaware corporation registered in California as a foreign corporation. Its principal place of business is 1023 Edwards Road, Burlingame, CA (Complaint #4; TWP Ans.). 4. Respondent Robert T. McIlvenna is president and secretary of TWP. Respondent Winnie O. McIlvenna is vice president and treasurer of TWP. They direct and control the activities of TWP (Complaint #5; TWP Ans.). 5. The product Oncor is a homeopathic drug which contains avena sativa in the strength \"1-X.\" 6. The scheme to market Oncor was a joint enterprise undertaken by SST and TWP. Their contract provided, inter alia, that TWP was responsible for manufacturing, assembling, packaging, and labelling the product; providing two professional endorsements of the product, at least one of which was to be from a medical doctor licensed in the United States; and providing at least 10 strong customer testimonials (CX-7, #4). 7. The contract provided, inter alia, that SST would draft a production script for a 28 minute \"television show in the format of an infomercial,\" employ a celebrity host, secure a professional television studio, edit the show, pay expenses of persons appearing on the commercial, develop a direct response advertising program for Oncor, analyze all advertising media, and select those media most suitable for direct response advertising of Oncor (CX-7, ## 2, 3). SST would also provide a written estimate of projected sales and inventory requirements to TWP, provide a merchant credit card account, and create a logo and package design for the product. SST retained the exclusive right to the name. 8. Both Spiegel and Sergio participated in drafting the script for the Oncor commercial (Tr. 253-254). SST would not be compensated unless the show went on the air and sales of the product Oncor were profitable (Tr. 237). 9. Under the contract, TWP was obligated to provide legal review of the program. SST hired Kirkpatrick Dilling, Esq., for this purpose and paid for his services with the understanding that TWP would reimburse SST. Mr. Dilling kept both parties advised of potential legal problems with the program (Tr. 235). Also, Mr. Speigel kept TWP advised of Mr. Dilling's advice (Tr. 248). Mr. Dilling ultimately advised them that the program in question was in compliance with applicable law (Tr. 238; SST Ex. A-E). Mr. Dilling's employment was terminated by SST on January 28, 1991 (Tr. 250). 10. TWP provided the individuals who gave testimonials in the Oncor commercial. 11. Proceeds were distributed in accordance with the contract (Tr. 259). Oncor was sold for $49.95, and consumers were directed to either (a) mail a check payable to Oncor to P.O. Box 29012, Phoenix, Arizona 85030, an address controlled by SST, or (b) authorize a charge to a credit card account over the telephone. All credit card sales were made through SST's merchant credit card account. Pursuant to formulas set forth in the contract, SST shared a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of Oncor with TWP (CX-7, ## 10-11; Tr. 7, has produced an infomercial on the Bahamian diet and is working on one for the Malibu cookie diet (Tr. 250-251). It produced one for Push Button Weight Loss which was never aired (Tr. 251). Although SST did not produce it, an advertisement for SST, drafted by Mr. Sergio, takes credit for an infomercial for another homeopathic product impotency called Y-Bron (CX-13; Tr. 252). n1 n1 CX-13 was received for the limited purpose of rebuttal of Mr. Spiegel's testimony that SST did not produce the Y-Bron program; however, Mr. Spiegel's testimony on this point is credible, and the exhibit has not otherwise been considered. Respondent's post-trial motion to strike this exhibit is untimely and is denied. Complainant's Expert Witnesses 13. Thomas H. Stanisic, M.D., has been a professor of surgery/ urology at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center since 1977 (Tr. 12). After graduating from Northwestern University Medical School summa cum laude in 1969, he subsequently became Board Certified in urology. He is currently involved in patient care and research, with a specialty in male sexual dysfunction and impotence (Tr. 13). For the past 10 years a large portion of his practice has been in impotence (Tr. 21). He has published on the subject of pharmacologic treatment of impotence in geriatric medicine (Tr. 14; CX-1). He is trained in traditional medical practice, and has no experience with homeopathic medicine (Tr. 14-15). He is a well-qualified expert in sexual dysfunction and his testimony was both forthright and credible. 14. Dr. Stanisic is very familiar with the world literature in the treatment of diseases of male sexuality (Tr. 26). He performed in depth research in medical journals and text books on the product in issue, and found no reference to this drug as a remedy for impotence (Tr. 21). He finds that avena sativa or oat plant is not recognized in traditional medicine or urology as a drug for impotence (Tr. 22, 24). 15. Impotence is usually caused by either physical or psychological problems (Tr. 23). The latter individuals are treated with psychotherapy or behavioral therapy by a sex therapist or a psychologist skilled in sexual dysfunction (Tr. 23). Physically impotent persons are diagnosed only after sophisticated testing. They may have hormone deficiencies, a problem with blood supply to the penis, or a need for a permanent penile prosthesis (Tr. 24). 16. Dr. Stanisic believes the product in issue is dangerous since a person might delay getting effective treatment for the cause of their problem, which may be multiple sclerosis or prostate cancer (Tr. 27). Also, some people may actually be dissuaded from seeking any other treatment since Oncor is not effective for the treatment of impotence (Tr. 43). 17. Dr. Stanisic's opinions herein are in accord with the informed medical consensus among urologists (Tr. 28). 18. Marvin Dean Crothers, M.D., is a physician in private practice specializing in homeopathic medicine and family practice, and has treated patients for impotence or sexual dysfunction (Tr. 47-48, 52). After receiving his M.D. degree in 1973, he began his formal training in homeopathy in 1976, and started teaching homeopathy in 1980 at the International Foundation for Homeopathy in Seattle, Washington. He is also Treasurer of the Council on Homeopathic Education, which is an accrediting agency for homeopathic courses in the United States (Tr. 48). He is a past president and current member of the board of directors and trustees of the American Institute of Homeopathy (Tr. 48-49). The latter is a national organization of medical doctors and dentists similar to the American Medical Association. Dr. Crothers is a well-qualified expert in homeopathic medicine and was a credible witness. 19. Homeopathy is based upon the \"law of similars\", i. e. that if a medicine produces certain symptoms in a healthy person, that the same medicine will cure diseases which produce the same symptoms (Tr. 50). A typical homeopathic medical examination entails examining all physical and mental complaints of the patient, medications taken, and family medical history (Tr. 51). Factors affecting the symptoms in question are reviewed. Thereafter, reference is made to traditional homeopathic texts such as Materia Medica to ascertain the one medication which most closely matches all of the patient's symptoms (Tr. 51). In view of this approach, the best match for a patient complaining, in part, of impotence may be a medicine which is not even listed as a cure for impotence (Tr. 53). Only one medicine is given since a second medicine might complicate what happens to the patient (Tr. 62). 20. There is very little information about avena sativa in the homeopathic texts, and it is not frequently used (Tr. 53). It has been listed as a cure for \"impotency\" in the Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica, Boericke (9th Ed.) (Tr. 64-66), and for \"irregularities of the male sexual system\" (among other symptoms) in Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica, Clark. These are both authoritative homeopathic reference works. However, the texts also list at least 30 other medicines for impotence, and it is the job of the homeopathic physician to evaluate the total picture of that person's symptomatology to find the one medicine that is likely to work. In Dr. Crothers' opinion, giving a single medication like avena sativa to every patient with impotence would not be effective (Tr. 57). 21. It follows that the mere listing of avena sativa in any of the standard, authoritative homeopathic reference works as being indicated for impotence, does not establish that the substance will be an effective remedy for that disease. 22. Homeopathic products are sold over the counter for acute conditions with recent and sudden onset or self-limiting conditions (Tr. 79, 82). Since impotence or sexual dysfunction is chronic rather than self-limiting and is potentially dangerous, it is inappropriate to market a product through the mail without medical supervision (Tr. 56, 82). 23. Also, Dr. Crothers thinks that the product is dangerous since it is likely to be ineffective, and the patient is unlikely to seek appropriate homeopathic care which could be effective (Tr. 56-57). 24. Dr. Crothers' testimony is in accord with the informed consensus among reputable homeopathic practitioners (Tr. 59-60). Respondents' Expert Witnesses 25. John Charles Reed, M.D., is a licensed homeopathic doctor. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1970, he had the equivalent of a residency in family practice and thereafter entered the Public Health Service until 1974. He was a family physician until 1982 in a pre-paid health plan. Thereafter he has been in private practice focusing on chronic pain and stress-related disorders. He uses acupuncture, oriental medicine, homeopathy, nutrition, and psychological therapies (Tr. 111). He is a member of the American Institute of Homeopathy and the National Center for Homeopathy (Tr. 113). He is also a member of the Arizona State Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners and is a past president of the board (RX-1). 26. He notes that the Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica, Boericke (9th ed.) (RX-3), which is used as a reference work by homeopathic practitioners (Tr. 117), lists avena sativa as a medicine for \"sexual debility\" and \"spermatorrhea: impotency; after too much indulgence.\" The Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica, Clarke, lists it for \"irregularities of the male sexual system.\" Dr. Reed considers those references to be \"indications for the use of avena sativa in those conditions\" (Tr. 119-120). 27. Tariq Kuraishy is a consultant to manufacturers who market homeopathic products. He has a master's degree in pharmaceutics from the University of London, England. He is an expert in the actual manufacture and formulation, and the purity of extractions (Tr. 131). He was vice president of the American Association of Homeopathic Pharmacists (Tr. 133). In his opinion, the product Oncor complies with the guidelines of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), a compilation of standards for source, composition, and preparation of homeopathic drugs (Tr. 134; RX-6, p. 2).n2 Drugs listed in the latter publication have specific criteria for their production and manufacture. The term 1-X applied to avena sativa indicates one tenth of the product weight per volume of the active ingredient to the final form. The oat plant is extracted one part with nine parts of alcohol/water solvent (Tr. 135). He was a consultant to Taylor-Wright Pharmacals when they produced the product in issue (Tr. 137). n2 According to FDA Compliance Policy Guide 7132.15, a product's compliance with requirements of the HPUS does not establish that it has been shown by appropriate means to be safe and effective for its intended use (RX-6, p.3). 28. Joseph Dudley Chapman, D.O., is a gynecologist, teacher, author, editor, and sex therapist. He is an expert in sexual dysfunction (Tr. 150). After receiving his B.S. from Roosevelt University of Chicago, he attended the College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery in Des Moines, Ohio. He later received a Ph.D. from the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, where he is now on the faculty (Tr. 139-140). He is also a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Ohio University (Tr. 140). He has written two books, \"The Feminine Mind and Body\" and \"The Sexual Equation,\" presented many papers before professional groups, written about 100 articles on a broad range of subjects including many on gynecology and obstetrics, and has given many lectures and media appearances on sexuality because of his intense convictions about the subject (Tr. 141; RX-7). 29. He participated in an informal study designed by Dr. Loretta Haroian, Research Director for the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (CX-4, p. 3; Tr. 155), in California on a homeopathic product containing avena sativa. He performed his part of the study in Cleveland, Ohio. The study began with a questionnaire on sexual history including questions about difficulty obtaining erections (Tr. 156). The people who identified themselves as dysfunctional, including men who had trouble obtaining erections, were asked to participate in a double blind cross-over study (Tr. 157). He had about 60 women and about 28 men as subjects (Tr. 161). Twelve of the original 40 men dropped out early because \"it was not working\" (Tr. 166-167). He does not know how many persons Dr. Haroian studied (Tr. 165). 30. Dr. Chapman has never known what amount of avena sativa was given the subjects in his group (Tr. 171). In fact, he allowed his subjects to vary the amount that they took indiscriminately (Tr. 191). At first, he used avena sativa in a dry, powder form, which he told the subjects to mix with orange juice. Later, he switched the subjects to a liquid form of avena sativa (Tr. 172). By talking with his subjects, he determined that a large segment of the men were starting to have enhanced sexual desire and function (Tr. 143-144, 183). Then he asked these men to participate in a hormone study, which was his primary interest (Tr. 144, 167). Dr. Chapman theorizes that avena sativa enhanced male sexual desire and erectile function by interfering with the binding of sex hormone binding globulin with testosterone (Tr. 146-147), thereby increasing testosterone levels in men (Tr. 176-177). He concluded that the amount of free testosterone increased in all of the final 28 subjects, but that avena sativa did not help about 35% of the original 40 male subjects (Tr. 182, 184). However, Dr. Chapman admits that the improvement in sexual dysfunction may have been due to the placebo effect (Tr.185). Finally, although he maintained written data, Dr. Chapman has never put his findings into the form of a report because he says \"it's still confusing, and I need more research\" (Tr. 173). Dr. Haroian has never made a written report of her findings (Tr. 202). 31. Based on his study, Dr. Chapman believes that Oncor is indicated for impotency, sexual debility, spermatorrhea and nervous exhaustion (Tr. 147). However, when he gave this opinion at the hearing, he was not even aware of the dosage level of the Oncor product (Tr. 188). He does not believe the dose makes any difference, although he says that a \"dropper-full\" daily is the minimum dose (Tr. 190-191). However, the dosage of homeopathic preparations and the frequency of repetition must be individualized to the patient (RX-5 at 38). Dr. Chapman's study lacks credibility and his opinion regarding Oncor's effectiveness is not persuasive. The False Representations 32. In their television commercial, Respondents make the representations set forth in subparagraphs (a)-(e), (k) and (m) of paragraph 8 of the Complaint. The language of the program length commercial which makes these representations is set forth under the representations quoted below. Each of these representations is materially false. (a) \"SST Super Stories\" is a talk show that regularly features and reviews products and is not a program length commercial. 33. Respondent's \"SST Super Stories\" is presented in the format of a typical television talk show. The \"host\" of the show, Chad Everett, interviews \"guests\" while an audience watches attentively and claps at appropriate times. The show consists of three segments, each of which is followed by a commercial with a toll free number to order the product, plus a fourth segment consisting of closing comments and disclaimers. The juxtaposition of material in television advertisement format with material in talk show format reinforces the impression that \"SST Super Stories\" is a talk show rather than a paid advertisement (CX-3). 34. The impression that \"SST Super Stories\" is a regularly scheduled show is made by the name of the show and by several references to Oncor being the topic of the day, implying that the show appears on other days with other topics (CX-4, lines 5, 26-27, 35-38, 528-529). 35. As previously stated, the \"show\" consists of four segments, with a standard television commercial for Oncor appearing after each of the first three segments. The first and fourth segments each have two references to the fact that the program is a paid advertisement. However, viewers tuning in after the first commercial could see two segments and two more commercials with an opportunity to order the product through a toll free number, and they would not see or hear the \"paid advertisement\" language. Even if they saw the disclaimer in the last segment, they may have already ordered the product. The second and third segments do have words appearing on the screen for a few seconds stating \"Results may vary from individual to individual,\" which is a type of advertisement disclaimer; however, many viewers would fail to see this language or would still not realize that the program is a paid advertisement. 36. Thus the above disclaimers are insufficient to dispel the overall impression that the program is a talk show. Since the Oncor program is a program length commercial, Representation (a) is false. The representation is material because it enhances the credibility of the representations made regarding the effectiveness of the product, and makes the statements made by the doctors and audience members appear independent and objective. (b) Oncor is recommended by impartial health professionals who are independent from the distributor of the product. 37. The program contains numerous endorsements of the product by Dr. Dudley Chapman, Dr. Loretta Haroian, and one by Dr. Marguerite Rubenstein. Dr. Chapman received a Ph.D. from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (\"Institute\") and is a member of the Institute's faculty. Dr. Haroian is Dean of Professional Studies at the Instutute, and Dr. Rubenstein is both Director of Practicum Studies and a member of the Institute's Board of Directors. 38. The program conveys the impression to the ordinary viewer that these health professionals were selected to be on the show by the producer and that they are impartial. Accordingly, the program makes Representation (b). 39. The representation is false since each of these professionals is closely tied to Respondents Robert and Winnie McIlvenna, who direct and control TWP. Robert is president and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute. Winnie is the Comptroller and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute (CX-9; CX-11; CX-12 at 29-30). The representation is material since their alleged impartiality tends to enhance the credibility of the product and induce its purchase. (c) Oncor can cure or treat impotency. 40. The program clearly makes Representation (c) by statements such as the following: So today we're gonna take a look at the subject of male impotence, or lack of sexual desire, or of sex drive, and an exciting homeopathic product called ONCOR, which is helping victims of this problem by stimulating their sexual desire. This product is recommended for men who are impotent, as well as for men who may need a little extra something in their sex life. (CX-4, lines 35-42; see also lines 5-9). 41. In addition, the \"host\" and many guests on the show stated or implied that Oncor was effective for impotence (CX-3). 42. Representation (c) is false. The active ingredient in Oncor is avena sativa (CX-5), and the traditional medical community does not consider that substance to be an effective treatment for impotence (Tr. 21-22, 24). This conclusion is in accord with the informed medical consensus (Tr. 28). 43. Furthermore, although avena sativa is one of a number of substances that a reputable practitioner of homeopathic medicine might prescribe for impotence, the substance is not always a proper treatment. A homeopath does not attempt to cure or treat a single symptom such as impotence in isolation. Instead, he treats the patient as a whole. A typical homeopathic medical examination entails examining all physical and mental complaints of the patient, medications taken, and family medical history (Tr. 51). Thereafter, reference is made to traditional homeopathic texts such as Materia Medica to ascertain the one medication which most closely matches all of the patient's symptoms (Tr. 51). In view of this approach, the best match for a patient complaining, in part, of impotence may be a medicine which is not even listed as a cure for impotence (Tr. 53). 44. There is very little information about avena sativa in the homeopathic texts, and it is not frequently used (Tr. 53). It has been listed as a cure for \"impotency\" in the Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica, Boericke (9th Ed.) (Tr. 64-66), and for \"irregularities of the male sexual system\" (among other symptoms) in Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica, Clark. However, the texts also list at least 30 other medicines for impotence, and it is the job of the homeopathic doctor to evaluate the total picture of that person's symptomatology to find the one medicine that is likely to work. It is the informed consensus among reputable homeopathic doctors that giving a single medication like avena sativa to every patient with impotence would not be effective (Tr. 57, 59-60). Accordingly, Representation (c) is materially false. (d) Oncor can increase sexual desire in men. 45. This representation is made during the program by statements such as the following: So today we're going to take a look at the subject of male impotence and lack of sexual desire or of sex drive and an exciting homeopathic product called \"ONCOR\" which is helping victims of this problem by stimulating their sexual desire. (CX-4, lines 5-9; also 38-40) . . . It seems to enhance in three areas: the first is libido, or sexual desire; the second is sexual performance, or the ability to have an erection; and the third is sexual sensation, or the feeling of pleasure. (CX-4, lines 118-121) 46. Representation (d) is materially false for the same reasons stated above with respect to Representation (c). (e) Oncor is recognized by the medical community as an effective drug for the treatment of impotency. 47. The program makes this representation through the statements of Doctors Haroian, Chapman, and Rubenstein, who are introduced as medical experts. Dr. Haroian states that \"According to the Homeopathic Materia Medica, the active ingredient in ONCOR is indicated in situations of impotence, sexual debility, and nervous exhaustion.\" Dr. Chapman states: Anyone who is impotent or can't get an erection can try it before he tries more dramatic measures. If there isn't some physical reason (as I said before), any man who suffers from lack of sexual desire or lack of sex drive can try \"ONCOR\" to get things going again. [CX-4 at 245-249; see also 291-308] 48. Dr. Rubenstein, described as a leading sex therapist, states: And I can see Oncor as a product that, for some people, can make a difference. It can enhance your sexuality, your orgasms, erections, arousal, it can increase libido, it can make you feel good about your sexuality again. And that's a lot to say about a product. Oncor is a good product and I'm going to continue to recommend it. 49. For the reasons stated above with respect to Representations (c) and (d), Representation (e) is materially false. (k) Oncor is safe and non-habit forming for all users. 50. This representation is made by the language \"Oncor is a male potency formula that, taken as directed, can be a safe and effective approach for some forms of non-organic impotence\" (CX-4, lines 175-177). Moreover, the representation is implied in such an advertisement for a medical treatment. 51. Representation (k) is materially false since many users of Oncor would not be helped, and taking the drug would cause them to delay seeking help for the cause of their problem. Some of these people may have serious conditions such as diabetes, prostate cancer, or multiple sclerosis (Tr. 27, 43, 56-57, 90). However, since Dr. Stanisic is not an expert in alcoholism, his opinion that 20 drops twice a day of the product, which contains alcohol, would be a problem for an alcoholic, is rejected. Since there is no credible evidence that Oncor is habit forming, Representation (k) is only partially false. (m) Oncor is recommended by someone who has no reason to be biased. 52. One of the primary \"guests\" on the program is Ray McIlvenna, who is portrayed as an ordinary consumer who has had a positive experience with the product and who highly recommends it to viewers. He was seated on stage with the medical experts. The program gives the impression that Ray McIlvenna has no reason to be biased in favor of the product. 53. Representation (m) is materially false. Ray McIlvenna is a close relative of Respondent Robert \"Ted\" McIlvenna, the manufacturer of the product, and they are both on the Board of Directors of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (CX-11, CX-12 at 30; Tr. 255-257). Thus Ray McIlvenna is not an ordinary consumer and the program should have disclosed that he has a reason to be biased. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. (a) The meaning of an advertisement is to be determined in light of the probable impact of this material on a person of ordinary mind. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178, 189 (1948); Peak Laboratories, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 556 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1977). The statute is intended to protect the gullible, naive, and less critical viewer, as well as the more sophisticated, wary viewer. Fields v. Hannegan, 162 F.2d 17 (D.C. Cir. 1947), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 773 (1947); M.K.S. Enterprises, Inc. v. Service, F. Supp. 1180, 1184 (E.D.N.Y. [P.S. Docket No. 19/185](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1986deci/19-185.htm) (P.S.D. July 10, 1986). Express misrepresentations are not required. It is the net impression which the advertisement is likely to make upon individuals to whom it is directed which is important, and even if an advertisement is so worded as not to make an express representation, if it is artfully designed to mislead those responding to it, the false representation statute is applicable. G.J. Howard Co. v. Cassidy, 162 F. Supp. 568 (E.D.N.Y. 1958); See also, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). (b) Where an advertisement is ambiguous or capable of more than one meaning, if one of those meanings is false, the advertisement will be held to be misleading. Rhodes Pharmacal Co. v. F.T.C., 208 F.2d 382, 387 (7th Ralph J. Galliano, [P.S. Docket No. 19/15](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1985deci/19-15.htm) (P.S.D. May 2, 1985 at p. 9). It is not difficult to select words that will not deceive. See, United States v. 95 Barrels of Vinegar, 265 U.S. 438 (1924). (c) An inconspicuous disclaimer is not sufficient to dispel the effect of false representations. [redacted], supra; Gottlieb v. Schaffer, supra. (d) The Administrative Law Judge can determine whether the representations are made, their effect on the ordinary mind, and materiality without the assistance of lay or expert testimony. Standard Research Labs, [P.S. Docket No. 7/78](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-78.htm) (P.S.D. Oct. 27, P.S. Docket 16/120-121, 31, F. Supp. rev'd on other grounds, 256 F.2d 681 (2nd Cir. 1958). 2. Applying the foregoing standards, I find that Respondents' advertisements make the representations alleged in ## 8(a)-(e), (k), and (m) of the Complaint. The language and other matter contained in the television program which directly or impliedly makes these representations is described in the findings of fact. 3. As set forth in the findings of fact, the representations set forth in subparagraphs (a)-(e) and (m) of paragraph 8 of the Complaint are false. Representation (k) is partially false. 4. Complainant established through the credible and forthright testimony of Drs. Stanisic and Crothers that the informed consensus among both allopathic and homeopathic doctors is that Oncor is ineffective for the treatment of impotence and lack of sexual desire. Accordingly, it is encumbent upon Respondents to produce persuasive evidence proving the consensus to be in error. Standard Research Laboratories, [P.S. Docket No. 7/48](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-48.htm) (P.S.D. April 4, 1980). Respondents have failed to produce such persuasive evidence. Respondent's expert, Dr. Reed, did not even testify as to the effectiveness of the product, but merely noted that the homeopathic texts \"indicated\" the use of avena sativa for impotence and \"sexual debility.\" As stated previously, the testimony of Dr. Chapman about his \"study\" has been rejected due to the failure of Respondents to inform Complainant of this study prior to the hearing. However, even if this testimony were considered, it would not persuade the Administrative Law Judge that the informed consensus is in error. In this regard, the study was neither reliable nor scientific, and Dr. Chapman was not a credible witness. 5. The fact that Respondents may have relied upon the advice of counsel is not a defense to an action under 39 U.S.C \u00a7 3005, where it is not necessary to prove scienter, or an intent to deceive, to establish a violation of the statute. Lynch v. Blount, 330 F. Supp. 689, 693 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). 6. The representations made by Respondent are material because they have a tendency to persuade viewers to order and pay for Respondent's product. 7. Since the Respondents Taylor Wright Pharmacals, Inc. and Sergio and Spiegel Television for Oncor, Inc. were in a joint venture for the sale of Oncor, and remittances were solicited through the mail, the jurisdiction of the Postal Service under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 is established for all respondents connected with the scheme, including the principals of the corporations. 8. Complainant has established its case by a preponderance of the reliable and probative evidence of record. S.E.C. v. Savoy Industries, Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1978). 9. Respondents are engaged in the conduct of a scheme for obtaining remittances of money through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. 10. Accordingly, the attached False Representation Order and Cease and Desist Order should be issued. This page was posted on April 19, 2007.

Dubious \"nutrition\" activities questioned. Quackwatch has posted a report about how bogus tests are used to prescribe expensive dietary supplement and herbal products sold by Standard Process Laboratories of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The report, based on documents collected over a 35-year period, concludes: Standard Process Laboratories products have been promoted with preposterous claims for more than 40 years. After the company and its founder were prosecuted for criminal misbranding, the claims gradually became less traceable to the company and now appear to come from independent sources. The products were\u2014and still are\u2014promoted for many conditions that are outside the legitimate scope of the practitioners (mainly chiropractors) who sell them. I advise people to avoid both the products and anyone who sells them. [Barrett S. [The shady history of Royal Lee and Standard Process Laboratories]. Quackwatch, March 29, 2007] Leading \"NICO\" proponent gets five years' probation. Wesley R. Shankland, II, D.D.S., who operates the Central Ohio Center for Facial Pain in Columbus, Ohio, has settled charges against him by entering into a consent agreement under which (a) his dental license will be suspended for six months; (b) he must complete 300 hours of continuing dental education that includes at least 40 hours in ethics, (c) he must not utilize any \"alternative\" dental or medical treatment without informing the patient that the procedure is nonstandard, (d) his ability to prescribe narcotics and psychiatric drugs will be restricted during 2008, and (e) his records must be available for review and monitoring by a physician or dentist who is experienced in the management of chronic pain. Shankland is a leading proponent of [\"neuralgia inducing cavitational osteonecrosis\" (\"NICO\")](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cavitation.html) and improperly advises that [amalgam fillings](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mercury.html) and [root-canal-treated teeth are problematic](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/holisticdent.html). The dental board's complaint not specify whether any of its concerns are related to these nonstandard theories and practices. Shankland publicly represents himself as having earned a masters degree in human anatomy from Ohio State University in 1994 and Ph.D. in human anatomy in 1997. His Web site and various other publications do not indicate where he obtained the \"Ph.D.\" However, a curriculum vitae filed in a recent court case identifies the source as \"Summit University of Louisiana.\" This entity, a correspondence school that operated from about 1993 through 2000, was never accredited, had no legal or academic standing, and certainly did not require the amount of knowledge and effort that reputable universities require for doctoral degrees. A 1999 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education described Summit as a \"diploma mill\" located in a \"converted bedroom\" in a small house on the outskirts of New Orleans. ]Selingo J. [Louisiana tries to close loopholes that allow suspected diploma mills to thrive](http://www.collegedegrees.com/news2/html/body_louisiana_to_close_diploma_mil.html). Chronicle of Higher Education, May 14, 1999, p A40] Intercessory prayer research blasted. Medscape General Medicine has published a brilliant commentary calling for an end to wasting scarce research dollars on studies of remote prayer. Its key points include: - Research into \"intercessory prayer\" are attempts to study whether miracles (extraordinary events manifesting divine intervention in human affairs) exist. - One very simple experiment that would leave little or no doubt could involve the regeneration of an amputated limb. The investigators could use as many universities and people as possible\u2014all the willing believers in the country, if necessary\u2014to pray every day for a year that at least one amputee would have a limb regrown and then examine all the thousands of amputees for signs of regenerating limbs. - \"Complementary and Alternative\" procedures such as acupuncture and herbal supplements are at least based on something physical, a substance and/or a process, and, as strange as many of these procedures may seem to be, they are still within the testable universe of physical science. Intercessory prayer is another matter entirely, and should not command the attention and resources of science. [Gaudia G. [About intercessory prayer: The scientific study of miracles](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/552742). Medscape General Medicine. March 20, 2007] Arkansas rejects antivaccination bill. The Arkansas Senate Committee on Public Health, Welfare and Labor has rejected [SB911](http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/ftproot/Bills/2007/public/SB911.pdf), which would have lowered the amount of mercury in the vaccines for children under 8 and for pregnant women by August 1, 2008. It was introduced by a Senator who apparently believes that the tiny amount of thimerosal (a preservative that contains mercury) in flu vaccine might trigger autism or other neurologic disorders. Several health care professionals testified at a hearing that there is no proven health hazard and said the bill would discourage some people from receiving vaccinations that can be life-saving. [Lyon J. [Committee rejects bill to reduce mercury in vaccinations](http://www.arkansasnews.com/archive/2007/03/27/News/341460.html).

It includes energy work (see \"vibrational medicine\"). Its theory posits \"wisdom\" of body, mind, and hand-mediated energetic healing (HMEH, HMEH approaches, HMEH traditions, hand-mediated healing modalities): Group of \"healing\" methods characterized by the belief that the practitioner's hands are agents of the transfer or interchange of something that feels like \"energy.\" HMEH encompasses acupressure, external qigong (Qigong therapy), Healing Touch, Jin Shin Jyutsu, Polarity (Polarity Therapy), reflexology, Reiki, shiatsu massage, Therapeutic Touch, and Touch for Health. hand psychology: Form of scientific palmistry. Its postulate is that one's hands reveal vast psychological information. Hand psychology features dermatoglyphics: the study of fine ridges on fingertips and palms. hand reflexology: Form of reflexology whose focus is the hand. It is one of the two basic modes of zone therapy. Harmonics: \"Transformative\" and \"curative\" mode of chanting developed and practiced by Tibetan monks. Proponents associate particular sounds with specific bodily \"energy centers.\" Harner Method Shamanic Counseling (HMSC): Admixture of classic shamanism and the work of anthropologist and author Michael Harner, Ph.D., founder and director of The Foundation for Shamanic Studies, in Mill Valley, California. The purported thrust of HMSC is problem-solving by divination. Supposedly, practitioners (\"ordinary reality HMSC counselors\") serve merely as facilitators, and sacred teachers in reality\" are the \"real\" counselors. hatha yoga (hatha, yoga): Method akin to kundalini yoga. It involves pranayama and the adoption of various bodily postures (asanas). The word \"hatha\" combines two Sanskrit words: ha, which means \"the breath of the sun\" (prana), and tha, \"the breath of the moon\" (apana). Hawaiian bodywork: Mode of massage originally practiced only by kahunas (see \"kahuna healing\"). It purportedly releases \"old patterns\" at the cellular level.\" Apparently, Hawaiian bodywork is a variation of, or identical to, lomi-lomi. Hawaiian Temple Bodywork (lomi bodywork, music, the hula (a Polynesian dance), and breathing exercises for raising mana (the \"life force\"). head reflex massage: Form of reflexology characterized by purported stimulation of \"reflex points\" on the head, for example, by pulling hair or by lightly \"pounding\" the entire head with fists. Healing Heart Meditation: Alleged \"Healing tool\" that purportedly \"re-connects\" people with their \"spiritual roots.\" It includes \"guided meditation.\" Apparently, one of its principles is that people are unconditional love. healing light kung fu (healing hands kung fu): Apparently, a combination of cosmic energy chi kung and Five Finger Kung Fu. Healing Love (Healing Love meditation, Healing Love practices, Seminal and Ovarian Kung Fu, Taoist Sexology and Practice): A foundational component of the Healing Tao System. It is a mode of sexual intercourse that purportedly \"cultivates,\" conserves, and transforms \"sexual energy\" through the \"Microcosmic Orbit,\" an alleged major \"energy channel.\" For men, Healing Love involves the \"power draw\": sex without ejaculation. Healing Tao (Healing Tao Practices, Healing Tao System, Healing Tao Warm Current Meditation, international healing Tao system): System of \"Body-Mind-Spirit discipline\" promoted by the Healing Tao Co., in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It is an alleged means of developing a \"solid spiritual body.\" Its purported ultimate goal is transcendence of physical boundaries. Healing Tao theory posits a soul and a spirit in \"man.\" \"Healing the Heart\" workshop: Psychospiritual component of a \"healing\" program run by cardiologist Stephen Sinatra, M.D. In 1995, the program included meditation and a \"visualization\" involving patients' requesting guidance from believable \"spiritual powers.\" Healing the Skin from Within: \"Complete skin care program\" developed by dermatologist Michael R. Bilkis, M.D. It allegedly affects skin problems on three levels: body, mind, and spirit. Healing Touch (HT): Variation of Therapeutic Touch and Non-Contact Therapeutic Touch whose purported design is to restore balance to the client's \"energy system.\" Healing Yoga: Technique developed by Kelly Piper. includes \"chakra opening\" and visualization (see \"creative visualization\"). Healtheology: One of the fields of study offered by the American Institute of Holistic Theology, a nonaccredited correspondence school in Youngstown, Ohio. The institute defines \"Healtheology\" as \"a theological science of health, espousing the concept that health and theology have a common ground.\" Healtheology encompasses acupressure, angelic healing, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, breathwork, home opathy, Prayer, transpersonal psychology, vibrational healing (vibrational medicine), and yoga. Its theory posits a soul with a threefold purpose: to experience, learn, and express itself. Practitioners are called \"Healtheologists.\" Health Harmonics: \"Technology\" that purportedly enables determination of the sound frequency one needs for \"balance\" and \"harmony\" of body, mind, and spirit. Health Kinesiology: Offshoot of applied kinesiology created by psychologist Dr. Jimmy Scott. Its theory posits the Five Elements (Five Phases), a \"meridian system,\" and \"reflex points\" for the Five Elements in the area of the navel. \"Corrective treatments\" may include \"remedies.\" HealthWatchers Analysis: Purported test of urine and saliva physical and emotional frequency\" Biological Immunity Analysis to weight management. Its centerpiece is the HealthWatchers Analysis. HealthWatchers System\u00ae, a mail-order house in Scottsdale, Arizona, defines: (a) \"Stress Pattern\" as \"the resistance created by People, Places, Circumstances and Events attracted to you because they are opposed to your Soul Pattern\"; (b) \"Soul Pattern\" as \"the pattern inherent in your Soul.the point-of-view from which you are able to see and express life when you are free from your Stress Pattern\"; and (c) \"Soul\" as \"the immortal, spiritual, moral or emotional nature of a human being.\" Heartwood massage: \"Holistic\" form of bodywork taught by the Heartwood Institute, in Garberville, California. It apparently encompasses breathwork, energy balancing, hypnotherapy, guided imagery, neo-Reichian massage, Polarity Energy Balancing, Swedish/Esalen massage, Swedish massage, and Zen Shiatsu. Hellerwork: Combination of massage, \"movement education,\" and dialogue invented in 1978 by aerospace engineer Joseph Heller, the first president of the Rolf Institute (see \"Rolfing\"). It stems largely from Rolfing and Aston-Patterning. Its theory posits \"masculine energy\" and holds that the body is a \"vehicle,\" \"hologram,\" or channel for \"life energy\" through which \"self-expression\" can \"radiate.\" Hemi-Sync\u00ae: \"Brain-integrating\" audiotape system developed by Robert A. Monroe (author of Journeys Out of the Body, Far Journeys, and Ultimate Journey) and promoted by The Monroe Institute, in Faber, Virginia. The institute claims that particular Hemi-Sync tapes can control pain, increase strength, lower blood pressure, reduce appetite, weaken addictive behavior, hasten recovery from illness or surgery, enhance recovery of speech and motor skills after a stroke, and control the metabolism of food by either maximizing or minimizing \"the caloric value retained.\" Hemi-Sync DEC training exercise: Derivative of Hemi-Sync purportedly designed for healing oneself and sending \"healing energy\" to others. \"DEC\" stands for \"Dolphin Energy Club.\" The Hemi-Sync DEC training exercise uses the dolphin as a symbol of intelligent \"universal energy.\" Hemi-Sync HCA test, herbal identification, Herbal Tracer Test): Pseudodiagnostic method developed by Prof. George Benner, a \"Master Herbologist\" and the author of Herbal Crystals as Curative Patterns (1979). Reportedly, Benner's primary inspiration was a method of botanical identification developed by occultist Rudolf Steiner in the 1920s (see \"anthroposophical medicine\"). Steiner's method involved crystallizing the sap of botanical specimens with a solution of copper sulfate. The result was a crystalline fingerprint of the herb. Benner similarly processed saliva. He decided that the resultant salivary configurations correlated with the configurations of herbs useful, according to folklore, against the donors' health problems. Allegedly, the number of specimens of a single herb that match a saliva specimen is a barometer of the donor's need for that herb: the more matches, the greater the need. herb cupping: Variation of the water cupping method wherein the practitioner puts into the water an herb that supposedly helps to improve blood circulation and expel \"wind evil.\" High Touch: Part of BRETH. High Touch is a purported way of touching on an \"energetic\" or physical plane and an alleged means of \"soul-to-soul contact.\" Hippocrates health program (Hippocrates program): Variation of Nature developed by \"wholistic health educator\" Dr. Ann Wigmore (1904-1994), author of Be Your Own Doctor, The Healing Power Within, The Hippocrates Diet and Health Program, Hippocrates Live Food Program, Recipes for Longer Life, The Sprouting Book, The Wheatgrass Book, and Why Suffer?. Wigmore founded the Hippocrates Health Institute in 1957. The Hippocrates program encompasses brushing the skin, deep breathing, enemas, food combining, the Hippocrates Diet (see \"Living Foods Lifestyle\"), and exercises such as squatting. Its theory holds that \"integration of body/mind/spirit\" is central to health. In Belief: All There Is (1991), Brian R. Clement, codirector of the Hippocrates Health Institute, in West Palm Beach, Florida, asserts: \"[B]elief can bring you anything that you desire\" (p. 41). He further states that death is a \"sham\" (p. 67). holistic dentistry (holistic general dentistry): Form of general dentistry that may include acupuncture, biofeedback, CranioSacral Therapy, and/or homeopathy. holistic gynecology: Purported \"natural\" approach to women's health. It includes \"vitamin and herbal therapies\" and visualization (see \"creative visualization,\" above). holistic nursing (wholistic nursing): Form of nursing that exalts intuition and may include AMMA Therapy, biofeedback, guided imagery, Healing Touch, homeopathy, iridology, massage therapy, Oriental medicine (especially acupuncture), psychic healing, tai chi, and/or Therapeutic Touch. Its purported goal is integration of body, mind, and spirit. Holistic Palpate Energy Therapy: Form of aura balancing. holistic psychiatry: Form of \"psychiatry\" that may include biofeedback, bodywork, energy healing (see \"vibrational medicine\"), and homeopathy. holistic psychotherapy: Approach to psychotherapy promoted by Russian-born Reiki practitioner Katya Salkinder, M.A. Apparently, it is a purported means of releasing \"energy blocks\" created by \"unresolved emotional conflicts.\" holistic reiki: Variation of Reiki founded by ministers Marla and Bill Abraham. Holoenergetic healing\u00ae (Holoenergetics\u00ae): Psychotherapeutic form of energy healing (see \"vibrational medicine\") christened and advanced by Leonard Laskow, M.D., author of Healing with Love (Harper, 1992). The expression \"Holoenergetic healing\" means \"healing with the energy of the whole.\" The method's premises include the following. (a) Separation is illusory. (b) Maintenance of this illusion requires \"energy.\" (c) Often, physical or mental ill ness or stress is symptomatic of such consumption of \"energy.\" (d) Releasing oneself from the illusion of separation liberates tremendous \"energy.\" (e) Healing is the gradual elimination of the illusion of separation. Holoenergetics comprises four stages: (1) the recognition phase, wherein the patient purportedly identifies the source of his or her illness; (2) the resonance phase, wherein the patient allegedly comes to terms with the aforementioned source; (3) release, wherein the patient supposedly releases the \"disharmonious energetic pattern\" associated with the source; and (4) the reformation phase, wherein, according to Laskow, the patient replaces the \"dysfunctional\" pattern with an image symbolizing \"the positive life-force intentthe energy that's aligned with the natural order and harmony of the inherent healing process of the body.\" hologramic hypnotherapy: Method promoted by Donna Michel of New York City. It includes guided visualization (see \"creative visualization\" and \"guided imagery\"). Holographic Repatterning: \"Modality\" developed M.A. theory holds that the \"physical body\" is a \"frequency of energy\" and that human replaning: \"Technique\" promoted by author Dina Levine. It is a purported access to and means of transforming and eliminating \"spiritual blocks.\" Its postulate is that \"spiritual blocks\" are the key to physical, mental, and emotional problems and cause pain, sickness, and unworkable relationships. Holotropic Breathwork developed in the 1970s by Czechoslovakian-born psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, M.D., and his wife, Christina Grof, author of The Thirst for Wholeness. It involves breathwork (hyperventilation), sound technology (mainly loud music), and the drawing of mandalas (aids to meditation), and it may include \"focused bodywork.\" Holotropic Breathwork is an alleged access to one's \"natural healing energies.\" It purportedly can induce \"transpersonal experiences,\" which, according to Dr. Grof, can provide information about any \"aspect\" of the universe in the present, past, and future. homeoacupuncture: Injection of \"homeopathic solutions\" into acupoints. homeopathy (homeopathic medicine, homeotherapeutics, homoeopathy): Form of energy medicine (vibrational medicine) developed by German physician Samuel Christian Friedrich Hahnemann (1755-1843). Hahnemann coined the word \"dynamis\" to refer to the \"vital force.\" His final theory held that the \"vital force\" is the source of all biological phenomena, that it becomes deranged during illness, and that appropriate homeopathic \"remedies\" work by restoring the \"vital force.\" The major principles of homeopathy include the following. (a) A substance with specific effects in a healthy person can cure a person with similar symptoms. (b) The process of repeated dilution and vigorous shaking of harmful substances renders them \"medically active\" yet \"free of side effects.\" (c) Each body has only one soul; thus, a person has only one core problem at a time, and only one remedy is necessary for a \"curative action.\" (d) Proper selection of a remedy requires taking into account numerous minutiae about the patient's situation. (e) \"Mind symptoms\" usually are more important than physical symptoms. (f) Humans are \"soul energy\" vibrating in an \"energy pattern\" (the so-called physical body). (g) Cures involve interaction of the soul and cogitative, affective, and physical processes. Usually, \"inner peace\" is the first response to a remedy, \"better energy\" the second, and \"physical\" cure the last. homeovitic detoxification: Phase of homeovitics Contemporary Kratz, Pharm.D., and promoted by HoBoN, a \"pharmaceutical Florida.
