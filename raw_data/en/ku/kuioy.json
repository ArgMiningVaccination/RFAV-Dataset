Her work has helped so many people I know\". Daniella, South London. How does Distance Healing Work? Merran uses the [BodyTalk system](https://www.bodytalksystem.com/learn/bodytalk/session.cfm) with [MindScape](https://www.bodytalksystem.com/learn/mindscape/), a scientifically proven and structured technique that enables her to drop into an 'alpha state' of mind and access a higher state of awareness and intuition. Once 'in the zone', she can connect with her client's energy field, intelligence system and mind-body complex. A technique called neuromuscular biofeedback (muscle testing) is then used to help her establish a yes/no response. This technique is then applied to various [BodyTalk Protocol and Procedure charts](/bodytalk-protocol-chart) that map the entire mind-body complex. From here, Merran can find out very specifically, in priority order - exactly what part of her client's mind-body complex requires balancing. Using her knowledge of the BodyTalk system and her training as a naturopath, she then draws upon her knowledge of many other healing modalities, tools and techniques. Pulling all resources together, Merran can then effectively facilitate in fixing, balancing, clearing and repairing thousands of possible priority imbalances across the mind-body complex.
