Being safer around methamphetamine If you are going to use, before you do: - make arrangements for children to be cared for by someone who is not using - eat well for energy reserves - clean your teeth - use soap and water or alcohol swabs to clean your hands. When using: - use chewing gum to minimise tooth grinding - sip water as your mouth will get dry, but not too much - avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks which dehydrate you - avoid driving as your judgement will be impaired - avoid mixing with other drugs or medication - if you have sex, use condoms and lube and practice safe sex. After using: - catch up on fluids, food and sleep the next day - avoid driving as you will be tired. Method of use Taking any type of speed, including methamphetamine, orally is generally safer than smoking, injecting or snorting because your stomach can handle acidic and foreign substances better than your lungs, veins or nose. Swallowing methamphetamine in empty pill capsules or wrapped in cigarette papers and drinking plenty of water reduces potential harm. The vapour produced from smoking methamphetamine can damage your lungs and smoking is more addictive than snorting or eating. If you do smoke, use a shatterproof Pyrex pipe. Other pipes (or glass) can get too hot or give off toxic fumes. Avoid using broken or cracked pipes. Damaged pipes can lead to burns, cuts and infections. If you snort methamphetamine, ensure it is finely chopped with a razor or knife and use alternate nostrils. Also, avoid sharing straws for snorting. Blood and mucus left on the straw can cause the spread of blood-borne viruses, such hepatitis and HIV. Injecting methamphetamine increases your risks of HIV, hepatitis and sepsis, a bacterial infection of your injecting wound, if you share needles (and other equipment). There is also a risk of skin abscesses and collapsed veins. Using a wheel filter can help to remove impurities that cause infections. Injecting also increases your risk of stroke and heart attack. If you are injecting, you can access needles, syringes and other equipment to support safe injecting practice and reduce risk of health-related complications through the [Needle Exchange Programme(external link)](http://www.nznep.org.nz/about-us). Needle exchanges also provide for the safe disposal of used needles "}
