This is the Light that shines in our heart. CHANDOGYA UPANISHAD I am the first and the last. I am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore, and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin. I am the mother and the daughter....I am she whose wedding is great, and I have not taken a husband....I am knowledge, and ignorance. -THUNDER, PERFECT MIND, Gnostic poem, 100 A.D. Surrounding each image is a 5 x 10.5 foot arched frame specifically designed for the Sacred Mirrors. The frames feature a sculptural relief of the history of the universe, from big bang cosmogenesis through biological and technological evolution, providing a philosophical framework in which to view the Sacred Mirrors.
