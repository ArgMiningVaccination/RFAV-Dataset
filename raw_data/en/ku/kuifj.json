Therefore, vaccination is an effective way to protect your baby against certain vaccine-preventable diseases. A number of vaccinations are required in the first few years of a child's life, and it is important that your baby receives their vaccinations on time so that they can achieve maximum protection. The Department of Health and Ageing's National Immunisation Program (NIP) outlines the recommended vaccinations for babies and when they are due. Vaccinations listed in the NIP are free, and include vaccination at birth, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. 2,3 The schedule then resumes at 4 years, and again at adolescence (12-16 years). The NIP includes the following vaccinations for babies in their first 18 months: |Age||Vaccination| |Birth|| | |2 months|| | Additional vaccine available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants and medically at-risk children (from 1 July 2020): |4 months|| | Additional vaccine available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants and medically at-risk children (from 1 July 2020): |6 months|| | | | Additional vaccine for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (QLD, NT, WA, and SA) and medically at-risk children: Additional vaccine available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants and medically at-risk children (from 1 July 2020): |12 months|| | Additional vaccine available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants and medically at-risk children (from 1 July 2020): |18 months|| | | | Additional vaccine for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (QLD, NT, WA, and SA) and medically at-risk children: Commonly asked questions Babies are given a variety of vaccines within their first 18 months of life. Under the National Immunisation Program (NIP), vaccines are provided for free at birth 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 months. The primary series of vaccinations are given at 2, 4, and 6 months. The gap between the doses of vaccines is to make sure that each dose has time to work effectively. At birth, generally within the first 24 hours and definitely within the first seven days, babies are given a vaccination for hepatitis B. The next vaccination time is at 2 months of age, but the vaccinations can be given from 6 weeks of age. Vaccination is a single injection for a combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), hepatitis B, polio, Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), an injection for pneumococcal disease and oral drops for rotavirus. At 4 months of age, babies are given their second dose of those vaccines given at 2 months of age. Giving additional doses of the same vaccine allows a baby's immunity to slowly build up over time and allows full immunity at the end of the dosing regimen. At 6 months, the third dose against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), hepatitis B, polio and Hib is given. Three vaccinations are given at 12 months: meningococcal ACWY, pneumococcal and a combined injection for measles, mumps and rubella. At 18 months, three vaccines are given - a combined injection against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chicken pox), the fourth dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine and a vaccine for Hib. Additional vaccinations are given to children who have certain underlying medical conditions and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Check with your doctor if you think your child may be eligible. Yes. All vaccines listed on the National Immunisation Program (NIP) are free. However, your healthcare provider or GP may charge you a consultation fee. There are additional vaccines that are not provided free as part of the NIP, which your GP may recommend, for example, those against influenza, vaccines against different types of meningococcal strains and travel vaccines. Your GP or practice nurse will be able to advise you about the benefits and risks of these immunisations for your baby. In addition, children with certain medical conditions may be eligible for additional vaccines for free. Speak with your GP or practice nurse for more information. You can visit your healthcare provider or GP who will determine if your child is eligible for a catch-up immunisation. This means your child may then follow a slightly different schedule to the National Immunisation Program (NIP). The National Immunisation Program (NIP) includes vaccination at birth, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The schedule then resumes at 4 years, and again at adolescence. In addition to the NIP, you may wish to protect your child against other diseases - particularly if you are travelling. Some of these vaccines may be required at different ages. Your healthcare provider or GP will be able to advise you about the benefits and risks of these immunisations for your child and when they should be given. No. If your child is otherwise healthy and medically stable, infants can be vaccinated according to the usual schedule recommended by the National Immunisation Program (NIP), without correcting for their premature birth. However, it is advisable to check with your healthcare professional. Sources & Citations - Australian Government. Department of Health. Why get immunised?
