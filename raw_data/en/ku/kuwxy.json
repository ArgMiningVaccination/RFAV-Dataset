However, 15 the isomeric compounds are rarely disting uished due to inability of MSI to differentiate isomers in the probing area. 16 Coupling tandem mass spectrometry with MSI can facilitate differentiating isomeric compounds. Here we apply 17 MALDI -TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry imaging approach to revealing th e spatial distributions of isomeric di- 18 saccharides in plant tissues. First, the MS/MS imaging analysis of disaccharide -matrix droplet spots demonstrated the 19 feasibility of distinguishing isomeric species in tissues, by measuring the relative intensity of sp ecific fragments. Then, 20 we conducted tandem MS imaging of disaccharides in onion bulb tissues, which indicated that sucrose and other un- 21 known non -sucrose disaccharides exhibit heterogeneous locations throughout the tissues. This method enables us to 22 image disaccharide isomers differentially in biological tissues, and to discover new saccharide species in plant. This 23 work also emphasizes the necessity of considering isobaric compounds when interpreting MSI results. 24 Keywords : MALDI -TOF ; tandem mass spectrometry imaging; disaccharide isomer bulb; sucrose; 25 3 Introduction 26 Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has becom e more and more popular in visualizing metabolites (Banerjee, Feider, Klein, Rosenberg, 28 Brodbelt, & Eberlin, 2018 ) and even nanomaterial s (Chen, Xiong, Liu, Wan, Hou, He, et al., 2015 ; Xue, Liu, Chen, Xiong, Zhan, Sun, et 29 al., 2018 ) in biologic al sample s, including plant tissue s (Liao, Fu, Zhou, Rao, Zeng, & Yang, 2019 ). The distribution of biomolecules can 30 provide valuable information on the growth and physiological status of plants (Peukert, T hiel, Peshev, Weschke, Van den Ende, Mock, et 31 al., 2014 ; Shroff, Vergara, Muck, Svatos, & Gershenzon, 2008 ). However, there is a significant issue in MSI analysis that isobaric species 32 in the same position could not be diffe rentiated , which may cause the misinter pretation of location and function of isomer s. This limitation 33 could be overcome by coupling MSI with approaches capable of resolving the isobaric molecules, such as ion mobility (Nagy, Velickovic, 34 Chu, Carrell, Weston, Ibrahim, et al., 2019 ; Sans, Feider, & Eberlin, 2018 ) and 35 Amusant, Duplais, et 2018 For example, MS/MS imaging of lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) 34:3 in the maize leaves showed 36 that isomer ic lipids PG (18:3/16:0) and PG (18:2/16:1) have divergent locations , which might be neglected in MS imaging (Duenas, Klein, 37 Alexander, Yandeau -Nelson, Nikolau, & Lee, 2017 ). The observation that isomeric molecules have different distributions was also found 38 in other plant tissue . For instance, MS images of m/z 1319 was drastically different from the MS/MS images of 13191247 and m/z 39 1319995 in Populus tissue (Lunsford, Peter, & Yost, 20 11). However, most of the tandem MS imaging aims at eliminat ing the interfer- 40 ence from matrix, thus facilitating the target and quantification analysis of small molecules (Porta, Grivet, Kraemer, Varesio, & 41 Hopfgartner, 2011 ). Moreov er, tandem MS imaging would be practicable only in the case that the MS/MS of isobaric precursors generat e 42 different fragment ions. Unfortunately , some isomers are not easily discriminated by tandem mass spectrometry as a standalone methodol- 43 ogy, such as glycan and lipid isomers. Carrying out chemical reaction with isomers before MS2 can be helpful for discriminating them in 44 the tandem mass spectra . Recent efforts in coupling special reaction to tandem mass spectrometr y imaging have succeeded in discriminat- 45 ing isomeric lipid s in the same probed tissue s, such on-tissue Paterno -Buchi et ). 47 Another strategy to tackling the isomeric issue in MSI is to separat e isomers before sampl ing, that is, utilizing structure -specific derivatiza- 48 tion methods to modify one of the isomers . For example , the linkage -specific in situ derivatization of sialic aci d have been performed be- 49 fore MSI to separate the 2,3 -sialyllactose and 2,6 However, structure -specific reac tions are rarely available. 51 Mapping the disaccharide over time and space provide import ant implications for unders tanding the adaptive and stress response 52 (Guendel, Rolletschek, Wagner, Muszynska, & Borisjuk, 2018 ). Moreover, the distribution of carbohydrates can serve as indicators for the 53 flavor of fruits. One MSI study found that sucrose are mainly distributed in the upper side of cortical and pith tissue, whic h indicated top 54 side are sweeter than bottom si de of strawberry (Enomoto, Sato, Miyamoto, Ohtsuka, & Yamane, 2018 ; Guendel, Rolletschek, Wagner, 55 Muszynska, & Borisjuk, 2018 ). In some reports, the disaccharides in some plant tissue s were merely assigned to sucrose , such as Medica- 56 go (Ye, (Li, Hansen, Jorgensen, 57 Kannangara, Bak, al., 2013 ), and soybean seeds (Sagara, Spengler, & Vollmann, 2020 ). However, other disaccharide isomers 58 4 should also be considered. For example, only sucrose was identified in Medicago in a previous MSI study (Ye, et al., 2013 ), while both 59 sucrose and malto se were detected in Medicago by our recent MS/MS study (Zhan, Xie, Li, Liu, Xiong, & Nie, 2018 ). 60 In this work , we demonstrate that MALDI -TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry imaging can reveal the divergent distribution of disac- 61 charide isomers in plant tissue s. In our previous work, we showed that disaccharide isomers can be differentiated and relatively quantified 62 by the characteri stic fragments produced by MALDI -TOF/TOF in the negative mode. We further extend this approach to monitor ing the 63 fragments of disaccharide -chloride adduct [M+Cl]- throughout the plant tissue. We showed that MS/MS imaging can distinguish sucrose 64 and non -sucrose disaccharides within the same plant tissue and lead to discovering new disaccharide specie s in onion bulb. 65 Materials and Methods 66 Chemical and Materials 67 Chemicals. N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) and maltose were purchased from Louis, 68 MO, U.S.A.) . Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) , ethanol (HPLC grade) and methanol (HPLC grade) were obtained from Thermo Fisher. 69 The water was prepared using a Milli -Q water purification system (Millipore, MA, USA). The disaccharides isomaltose w as ob- 70 tained from TCI (Tokyo, Japan). Cellobiose was from J&K (Beijing, China). Melibiose was purchased from Aladin (Beijing, Chi- 71 na). All the disaccharide standards were dissolved in water at 100 \u00b5mol/L. 72 Plant tissues 73 Plant samples were purchased from local supermarket in Beijing. First, the plants, that is purple onion, white onion, purple grape 74 and green grape, were flash -frozen in liquid N 2, and then incubated in -20\u00b0C refrigerator for several hours. Next, the plant samples 75 were section ed at 20 m thickness using a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) at 20\u00b0C and 76 thaw mounted onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides . Extracts of onion bulb tissue was prepared in 50% water/methanol 77 for 8 hrs. 78 Mass spectrometry imaging 79 For MS and tandem MS imaging, NEDC (6 mg/mL) in 50% ethanol/water prepared was sprayed onto the tissue section s using au- 80 tomatic matrix sprayer (ImagePrep, Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The key parameters of ImageP rep in these experiments are as 81 follows: number of cycle, 35; spray power, 62%; spray on, 1 s; incubation, 20 s; dry time, 75 s. MS and 82 MS/MS imaging were performed on an MALDI -TOF/TOF mass spectrometer Bruker Daltonics, Germany) a smartbeam Nd:YAG laser source (355 nm, 2 kHz). The MS and tandem MS imaging were operated in the negative 84 mode. The laser power was set at 40%, repetition rate was 1 kHz. MS and MS/MS imaging spatial resolution were set to 200 m. 85 Each pixel was accumulated of 200 laser s hots. Regions of imaging were defined by using the optical image and MSI data image. 86 For tandem MSI, LIFT spectra of m/z 377 (selection window was set at \u00b13 Da) were monitored across the whole tissue. The imag- 87 ing data were acquired and processed using FlexImaging 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). 88 Results and discussion 89 5 Tandem MS imaging for differentiating disaccharide isomers 90 Coffee ring effect is a common phenomenon found in dried droplet spot (Hu, Chen, & Urban, 2013 ), which can cause trouble for 91 the quantitati ve analysis of biomolecules by MALDI -MS. In our previous report, we successfully quantif ied the disaccharide iso- 92 mers in a binary mixture based on the ir characteristic fragment ions (Zhan, Xie, Li, Liu, Xiong, & Nie, 2018 ), and applied this 93 method to the detection of honey adulteration recently (Qu, Jiang, Huang, Cui, Ning, Liu, et al., 2019 ). However, a n important pre- 94 requisite proposed that the coffee ring or sweet spot phenomenon would not affect the performance of quantitati ve analysis , which 95 means that the ratio s of characteristic fragments are very similar throughout the whole dried spot. There was very little variation of 96 fragment ratios between measurement s of eight different probed position s within one spot (Zhan, Xie, Li, Liu, Xiong, & Nie, 2018 ). 97 To test this hypothesis, we performed MS/MS imaging of precursor ion m/z 377 ([M + Cl]-, M is the molecule of disaccharide and 98 has a mass of 342 ) of four dried droplet spots of disaccharide isomers cellobiose, maltose and melibiose) with ma- 99 trix. As shown in Figure 1 a, we observed that most signals of fragment m/z 281 were found in the rim of spot when the ion image s 100 were not normalized. However, w hen the image s were normalized to total ion current (TIC), we found that fragment m/z 281 ([M- 101 H-60]-) formed homogeneous distribut ion in th ose spots, as shown in Figure 1b. Based on these observation, we can see that the 102 relative intensity of m/z 281 are stable across different positions within the whole spot. It's worth noting that the \"relative intensity \" 103 we used here doesn 't mean exact relative intensity of a fragment compared to most intensive peak in one mass spectrum , because of 104 the normalization method in MSI (Deininger, Cornett, Paape, Becker, Pineau, Ra user, et al., 2011 ). We normalize the ion image to 105 TIC in this work . Because we only monitor the fragments of ion m/z 377 in this work, most ions appeared in spectra are fragments 106 of disaccharides and thus TIC is summation of all fragment ions in all probed positions . The color of a fragment in normalized 107 MS/MS images can rep resent its fraction in all fragments. Meanwhile, all four disaccharide -matrix spots show ed similar phenome- 108 non by comparing the images after two data processing methods, as shown in Figure 1a and 1b. Moreover, the diverse colors of ion 109 images of four disaccharide isomer spots indicate d that the relative abundance of m/z 281 were different in these tandem mass spec- 110 tra, and thus could also be used to differentiate the se isomers. The representative MS/MS spectra in the center (up panel ) and rim 111 (down panel) of the maltose -matrix spots are displayed in Figure 1c. The signals (ordinate value) of fragments were much stronger 112 in the rim than that in the center region , due to the \"coffee ring effect\". Though there are significant difference between the absolute 113 intensity of fragment ions in these regions, we found no obvious difference between their fragment pattern s. These results demon- 114 strate d that the MS/MS imaging can be used to reflect the diverse distribution of disaccharide isomers , by comparing the relative 115 intensity of certain fragment ion , despite that they have same fragment species . To further validate the method , we prepared mixture 116 of isomaltose and maltose in different ratios and imag ed the droplet spots in the MS/MS mode. As shown in Figure S1, the color of 117 ion images of m/z 161 changed gradually with increasing quantity of maltose. When the ratio of isomaltos e to maltose changed 118 from 5:1 to 1:5, the ion images of m/z 161 changed from blue (Figure S1a) to red (Figure S1d) . Meanwhile, the ratio of m/z 161 to 119 179 in the extracted mass spectra changed from 11:100 (Figure S1a) to 100:83 (Figure S1d) . This observation is consistent with our 120 previous measurements (Zhan, Xie, Li, Liu, Xiong, & Nie, 2018 ). 121 6 122 Figure 1 MALDI -MS/MS imaging of disaccharide -matrix mixture spots. The ion images of fragment m/z 281 of disaccharide isomers 123 were cellobiose, maltose, melibiose, respectively . The images were as a) no normaliza- 124 tion and b) normaliz ed to TIC . c) Representative MS/MS spectra of maltose in the center (up) and rim (bottom) of the dried spot . 125 MS and MS/MS imaging of purple onion bulb 126 Disaccharides are important energy sources (carbohydrate energy storage molecule) utilized by biological systems, for ex ample 127 sucrose for plant and trehalose for microorganisms (Ye, et al., 2013 ). Moreover , some disaccharides have particular bio-functions, 128 other than energy storage (Jensen, Peters, & Bhuvaneswari, 2002 ; Paz-Alfaro, Ruiz -Granados, Uribe -Carvajal, & Sampedro, 2009 ). 129 To better understand the roles of disaccharides in plant, w e investigate d the spatial distribution of disaccharides in various plants, 130 including onion and grape , by recording the TOF/TOF spectra of m/z 377 throughout the tissue . Before that, we have applied mass 131 spectrometry imaging to mapping the distributions of some biomolecule s within purple onion bulb tissue. The MSI result indicated 132 that some compounds exhibit distinct locations within onion bulb cross section, as shown in Figure 2. The optical photo of onion 133 bulb tissue is displayed in Figure 2a, indicating the outer epidermis with purple rim. For while in the outer epidermis cells (Figure 2c) . It revealed that the 136 compounds in the outer epidermal cell and inner epidermal cell of purple onion ( A. cepa ) bulb are different , which had also been 137 7 demonstrated by single cell mass spectrometry analysis (Gong, Zhao, Cai, Fu, Yang, Zhang, et al., 2014 ). Our MSI results is con- 138 sistent with the single cell MS measurements, indicating that inner epidermis has more glycans than outer epidermis cells. Moreo- 139 ver, the single cell analysis estimated the sucrose concentration to be 20 -50 mM, but the authors did not take other disaccharid e 140 isomers into consideration. 141 142 Figure 2 Mass spectrometry imaging of purple onion (A.cepa ) bulb cross section . a) Optical photography of the onion cross -section. b) Ion 143 images of m olecules accumulat ing in the inner layer of onion revealed by MSI . c) Ion images of m olecules accumulated in the outer layer 144 of onion are revealed by MSI. 145 Next, we monitor ed the fragments of disaccharide chloride adduct [M+Cl]- (m/z 377) throughout the onion bulb tissue in the 146 TOF/TOF imaging mode . The normalized ion images of several fragments were displayed in Fig ure 3b and 3c. Obviously, the 147 product ions m/z 215 ([M-C6H10O5+Cl]-) and 341 ([M-H]-) are accumulated in inner epidermis of onion bulbs (Fig ure 3a and 3c), 148 while fragment ions m/z 251 ([M-H-C6H12O6]-), 179 ([M-H-C6H10O5]-) and 221 ([M- 149 H-C4H8O4]-) are main ly found in the middle epidermis region (Figure 3b). The phenomenon observed in the non -normalized images 150 were similar with that in the normalized ones (Figure S2). In our previous report, we confirm ed the existence of sucrose from the 151 diagnostic peaks of m/z 215 and 341 (Zhan, Xie, Li, Liu, Xiong, & Nie, 2018 ). In this work, we also assigned these peaks to the 152 presen ce of sucrose in onion bulb, which have also been determined by GC (gas chromatography) and LC (liquid chromatography) 153 (Benkeblia, Shiomi, ; Davis, Terry, Chope, & Faul, 2007 ; Downes & Terry, 2010 ). However, identifying other 154 disaccharide isomers is not easy because the possibility of coexisting multi -isomers. We suggest that chemical derivatization cou- 155 pled with GC-MS and LC -MS could identify these disaccharides , by comparing them with disaccharide standards as possible can- 156 didates (Liu, Lou, Ding, Li, Qi, Zhu, et al., 2013 ; Pokrzywnicka & Koncki, 2018 ). The representative tandem mass spect ra of di- 157 saccharides in the middle and inner epidermis region were shown in Fig ure 3d and 3e, respectively. Clearly, the ir mass spectra were 158 different from each other , especially the relative abundance of m/z 179 ([M-H-163]-) and 341 ([M-H]-). Based on above discussion, 159 the difference of fragmentation pattern indicate d the different composition s of disaccharides in these regions. To validate these ob- 160 servation s, we cut the onion bulb into halves and extracted carbo hydrates with 50% methanol solution . The tandem mass spectra of 161 disaccharides in the extract s are shown in Fig ure S3. The MS/MS results were in accordance with that in the TOF/TOF imaging , 162 8 indicating that there was no or few delocalization of glycans during sectioning bulb tissue. The lateral resolution s of these images 163 are relatively lower than some published animal tissue, due to intrinsic characters of plant tissue, such as complex texture , low lipid 164 and high water content (He, Guo, Luo, Sun, Lin, & Cai, 2019 ; Li, Zhang, Ge, Liu, & Li, 2018 ). Since most studies of the disaccha- 165 ride in onion was on sucrose (Benkeblia, Onodera, Shiomi, 2004 ; Pohnl, Schweiggert, & Carle, 2018 ), our finding s demonstrated 166 the presence of other disaccharide isomers and they exhibit ed distinct distributions within onion bulb . The observation here was 167 also found in another purple onion bulb tissue (Figure S4), exclude the possibility of artificial results. In a previous report, the dis- 168 tribution of linkage and anomeric isomers of disacch aride was investigated in a tripartite symbiosis system of moss, cyanobacteria, 169 and fungus in the positive mode (Velickovic, Chu, Carrell, Thomas, Pasa -Tolic, Weston, et al., 2018 ). We believe that our method 170 can also be applied in the bio-system of plant -fungus symbiosis . 171 -TOF/TOF of disaccharide isomers in purple onion bulbs . a) optical photography of onion bulb tissue , outer 173 epidermis is in left bottom with red edge ; b) the ion images of fragments derived from non-sucrose disaccharides; c) the ion images of 174 fragments m/z 215 and 341, which derived from sucrose; d) the representative mass spectrum of region with dominant non-sucrose disac- 175 charides; e) representative mass spectrum of region with dominant sucrose signals. The ion images were normalized to TIC . All the ion 176 images have same full intensity threshold in color bar. 177 MS/MS imaging of disaccharides in other plant tissues 178 Furthermore, we performed the tandem mass spectr ometry imaging analysis of disaccharide s in other plant tissue, namely, white 179 onion and grape . We compared the MS imaging and MS/MS imaging results of white onion bulb cross section, as shown in Fig ure 180 4. From the ion image of m/z 377, we found that the distribution of disaccharides was homogenous across the tissue , without an 181 9 obvious uneven distribution in different regions of bulb tissue . However, ion images of fragment m/z 161 show distinct distribution 182 in the bulb cross section, implying that non-sucrose disaccharides accumulate in the outer epidermis region. 183 184 Figure 4 Comparison of the MS/MS imaging and MS imaging of disaccharides in the white onion bulb cross section. MS imaging reveals 185 a homogenous distribution of disaccharides, but the MS/MS image shows that sucrose relatively accumulated in the inner layer. The yel- 186 low arrow points from inner epidermis to the outer epidermis. MS/MS image was normalized to TIC. Different maximum intensity thresh- 187 olds were applied in these two images. 188 When compar ing the ion images of fragments m/z 215 and 161, we observed an interesting phenomenon that the relative intensity 189 of m/z 215 and 161 gradually changed across the tissue . It indicates that t he proportion of sucrose (m/z 215) in total disaccharides 190 decreased gradually from inner epidermis to outer epidermis region, as shown in Fig ure 5a. On the contrary, the proportion of non- 191 sucrose disaccharide isomer (m/z 161) increased gradually from inner epidermis to outer epidermis regions (Figure 5b). We divided 192 the tissue into three parts, region of interest (ROI) 1 to 3 , from left to right . The representative mass spectra of three ROIs are 193 shown in Figure 5c, d and e, respectively. We found that t he ratio of m/z 179 (or m/z 161) and 215 increased gradually from ROI 1 194 toward ROI 3 . We observed a similar trend of fragment patterns in the ion images without normalization, as shown in Figure S5. 195 This observation was slightly different from that in purple onion bulbs. A repeated experiment on another white onion bulb tissue 196 show ed similar phenomenon (Figure S6). In order to validate such distribution of disaccharide isomers, we have cut the white onion 197 bulb and acquired the MS/ MS spectra, in a same way with purple onion. The results also showed that inner epidermis have higher 198 fraction of sucrose (Figure S7). Moreover , we also observed heterogeneous distribution of disaccharide isomers in purple (Figure 199 S8) and green grape (Figure S9) cross sections . 200 10 201 Figure 5 MALDI -TOF/TOF imaging of disaccharides in white onion; a) ion images of m/z 215; b) ion images of m/z 161; representative 202 mass spectra of ROI were shown in c) ROI 01, b) ROI 02, e) ROI 03 . ROI 01 was in the inner epidermis while ROI 03 was in the outer 203 epidermis. The ion images are normalized to TIC. Different maximum intensity thresholds were applied in these two ion images. 204 In conclusion, we developed a tandem mass spectr ometry imaging approach to map the distribution of disaccharide isomers in 205 plant tissues. We demonstrated that isomers can be dist inguished in the same tissue via MALDI -TOF/TOF tandem MSI. The exper- 206 iments on plant tissue indicat ed the distinct distribution of sucrose and non -sucrose disaccharides . Such a distinct distribution of 207 disaccharide isomers may suggest their diverse biological function, such as serving as carbon source, regulating protein function 208 and so on. Infrared -based microspectroscopic method have also been utilized in visualizing sucrose distributio n in the cereal crop 209 barley and Arabidopsis , but Muszynska, & Borisjuk, 2018 ). Comparing with the recent report utilizing liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) -ion mobility 211 mass spe ctrometry in imaging (Nagy, et a l., 2019 ), MALDI -TOF/TOF imaging is superior in lateral resolution 212 and convenience , which could facilitate the study of bacteria -plant interaction in more details. However, for better interpreting the 213 observation, we may need to include other analytical approaches (such as GC, LC and electrophoretic techniques) to identif y the 214 disaccharide isomers , by comparing the disaccharide standards and the disaccharides in plant extracts (Pokrzywnicka & Koncki, 215 2018 ). We believe that the plant physiologist and food chemist can benefit from our findings. For example, t his method can be ap- 216 plied to investigate the effect of storage condition on distribution of saccharide within onion s (Benkeblia, Onodera, & Shiomi, 217 2004 ). Recently, one study combining combined on -tissue chemical derivatization and tandem mass s pectrometry imaging has re- 218 vealed distinct distribution of steroid structural isomers in human adrenal glands (Takeo, Sugiura, Uemura, Nishimoto, Yasuda, 219 Sugiyama, et al., 2019 ). This work suggests t he significance of tandem mass spectrometry imaging in differentiating isomers of 220 biological tissue s. Our work also remind s of the mass spectrometry imaging community that even though fragment species of iso- 221 mers are same, we can differentiate them in tissue by using relative intensity of definitive fragments. 222 Acknowledgments 223 11 This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21625504, 21827807, 21675160, 224 and 21790390/21790392 ), and Chinese Academy of Sciences. 225 Conflict of Interest Disclosure 226 The authors declare no conflict of interest. 227 12 REFERENCES 228 Banerjee, S., Zare, R.
