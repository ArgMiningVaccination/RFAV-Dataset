James David Ford, D.D., offered the following prayer: As we meditate on all the circum\u00ad stances that have touched our lives and attempt to measure the values that have been our heritage, we are grateful, 0 God, for our families that have given us life and nurtured us along the way. Make us aware of the spiritual gifts of those who have cared for us and whose patience and love has been our support. In gratefulness and praise, 0 God, we offer this prayer of thanksgiving. Amen.

Mr. Speaker, due to previously scheduled activities in my district, I was unable to vote to ap\u00ad prove the Journal of October 31, 1989, taken this morning, November 1, 1989, my vote would have been recorded as \"yea.\" PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the Delegate from American Samoa [Mr. FALEOMA\u00ad VAEGA] please come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance? Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA led the Ple~ge of Allegiance as follows: D This symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g., D 1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26789 I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub\u00ad lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Mr. Hallen, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate had passed a joint res\u00ad olution and a concurrent resolution of the following titles, in which the con\u00ad currence of the House is requested: S.J.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on Civil Service of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service may be permitted to sit while the House is reading for amend\u00ad ments under the 5-minute rule on Thursday, November 2, 1989.

APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 2742, LIBRARY SERV\u00ad ICES AND CONSTRUCTION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1989 Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill <H.R. 2742) to extend and amend the Library Serv\u00ad ices and Construction Act, and for other purposes, with Senate amend\u00ad ments thereto, disagree to the Senate amendments, and request a conference with the Senate thereon. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? Mr. LEWIS of California.

PRESIDENT VETOES WAR ON DRUGS (Mr. CHAPMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute, and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CHAPMAN. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend the District of Columbia broke a rather dubious record. The record was 369 murders committed in the District in 1988. There are 60 days left to go in 1989, and it appears that perhaps there will be additional murders daily. We read that 80 percent of these murders are drug related. Last Janu\u00ad ary our President said that this scourge of drugs will stop in America and declared war on drugs. The Dis\u00ad trict of Columbia, through our newly appointed drug czar, became the test bed to fight this war. Congress has responded in our ap\u00ad propriations bill with $32 million for antidrug emergency initiatives, 700 new police officers for the District, prison facilities to hold the dealers and the murders, $1.8 million for drug prevention programs in our public schools in the District, and $1.3 mil\u00ad lion for after school activities for our children in the District. Now the President has vetoed the District Appropriations bill. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, did you really mean to veto the war on drugs? ORTEGA, A MENACE TO PEACE <Mrs. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.> Mrs. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, to the surprise of no one except the easily duped liberals, Daniel Ortega has suspended the cease-fire in Nicara\u00ad gua. He is afraid of open and fair demo\u00ad cratic elections and is laying the groundwork to take the next step, which is to suspend the election. The time has come to renew military aid to the Contras fighting for a free Nicara\u00ad gua. 0 1030 Mr. Speaker, Ortega has not fulfilled the agreements of the accord which called for a cease-fire. He disrupted a peaceful and fruitful summit of Presi\u00ad dents from many countries this week\u00ad end in Costa Rica. His was the only sour note, as symbolized by the mili\u00ad tary fatigues which he wore there. Mr. Speaker, this little man is a menace to peace in our hemisphere. How many more accords must he ignore? How many more promises must he break? How many more meet\u00ad ings can he disrupt before we wake up to the fact that Daniel Ortega's forces must be met at the battlefield if the polling places close? BUSH'S VETO MAKES MOCKERY OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AS A MODEL FOR THE ANTIDRUG EFFORT <Mrs. BOXER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Speaker, Presi\u00ad dent Bush and his drug czar, William Bennett, claim they want to make the Nation's Capital a model for the na\u00ad tional antidrug effort. The Bush veto makes a mockery of this model. The Bush veto puts the bag of crack the President held up on his TV speech back on the streets of Washington, DC. The Bush veto strikes out $32 mil\u00ad lion for the drug emergency initiative for our Nation's Capital. The Bush veto strikes 700 new police officers on the streets of our Nation's Capital. In addition, the Bush veto strikes hiring eight additional judges plus support staff to alleviate a terrible backlog in the court system in our Nation's Cap\u00ad ital. The Bush veto delays two new prisons needed to house as many as 1,800 criminals behind bars. Mr. Speaker, this is the second veto in 2 weeks because Mr. Bush wants to intercede in people's lives. THE SEQUESTRATION TIME BOMB IS TICKING <Mr. CONTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.> Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, while we while away the time in this historic Bi\u00ad centennial Congress, a time bomb is ticking. Sequestration, that automatic across-the-board cut in spending, has 26790 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 been in effect since October 16, divert\u00ad ing funds from the war on drugs that we will debate today, diverting funds from the air traffic controllers we de\u00ad bated yesterday, from the earthquake relief we debated last week. Sequestra\u00ad tion is ticking away because Congress has yet to move on deficit reduction legislation that was called for last April. That legislation, known as reconcili\u00ad ation, holds the key to the future. If we cannot pass a reconciliation bill, then our budget process is not just sick; it is mortally wounded. Reconcili\u00ad ation was meant to bring automatic entitlement spending under control. If we cannot pass a bill to make $14 bil\u00ad lion of sham savings and gimmicks, agreed to as part of a \"see-no-evil , hear-no-evil \" budget resolution, how will we ever get real, uncontrollable spending under control? Mr. Speaker, the time bomb of se\u00ad questration is ticking away-tick, tick, tick. Vital human needs are going unmet, while we wallow in inactivity on reconciliation. Let's get moving. Tick, tick, tick, tick. PRESIDENT BUSH IS HUNG UP ON ABORTION <Mr. SMITH of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the President seems to be hung up, and what he is hung up on is abortion. Because of that hangup he is now not only going back against what he has pronounced before as his raison d'etre, as his philosophical approach to gov\u00ad ernment, but he is also going against what he said he wanted to do most this year. Mr. Speaker, President Bush vetoed the D.C. appropriations bill because they, with their money, collected in the District of Columbia, wanted to fund, under Medicaid, abortions for young women who have been victims of rape or incest, or in the case of the life of the mother being threatened. The President says, \"Huh uh.\" Now before he said, \"local control,\" folks. \"I believe in States' rights and local rights.\" Now he says, \"you can't spend your own money,\" and now he says to them, \"the 700 policemen I told you you could have, you're not getting them.\" Mr. Speaker, the crime rate; let it go up. The murders; let them continue. Is that what we want from a President of the United States? I think not. LET US PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS <Mr. BURTON of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I find it perversely amusing that some of my colleagues are sur\u00ad prised that Daniel Ortega has started the shooting war in Nicaragua again. What did you expect? He is a Commu\u00ad nist dictator who continues to receive massive supplies of Soviet military equipment. He has seen the United States has no resolve in dealing with Noriega of Panama-and we have cut off military aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. He doesn't think we will do anything but pass resolutions condemning him-and he is probably right. We'll show him! We'll kill him with paper. But help the Contras fight the war machine the Soviets supply? Never. We talk freedom and democra\u00ad cy. But if we really mean it, we must put our money where our mouth is. THE D.C. APPROPRIATIONS BILL <Mr. FROST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a serious question. What is President Bush waiting for? The homi\u00ad cide rate in the District of Columbia, primarily as a result of drug traffick\u00ad ing, has already surpassed last year's deadly total. Schoolyards are poisoned with dealers peddling to children. Par\u00ad ents are selling crack cocaine from their bedrooms. Babies are born drug\u00ad addicted before they take their first breath. Is President Bush waiting for it to get worse? If so, how bad must it get? How many more must die? How many more families will be destroyed? Our streets in the District are not safe in broad daylight anymore. And yet President Bush has vetoed the D.C. appropriations bill. He is pre\u00ad occupied with the abortion issue, and meanwhile his veto has canceled the 700 officers that would increase police visibility on the streets and provide the extra manpower to close down open-air drug markets. Doesn't the President want security for the fami\u00ad lies of the District of Columbia? His veto tells us he doesn't. He has proven that he really is not committed to drug war. These funds are not a luxury for the District of Columbia. They are a necessity. ORTEGA IS AFRAID OF FREE ELECTIONS <Mr. DOUGLAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. Speaker, the in\u00ad spirational leader of the Nicaraguan Government is Mao Tse Tung. Mao Tse Tung said that all political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, and Daniel Ortega this morning made that very clear. He is afraid of free elec-tions in his own dictatorship. He knows the polls show him at 28 per\u00ad cent, and Violetta Chamorro, at 40 percent. She is a woman whose hus\u00ad band was killed by Somoza, whose newspaper was part of the original Sandino coalition and who is now run\u00ad ning against that little punk dictator down in Nicaragua. And the wimp wing of the Democratic Party is going to sell out the resistance once again. The white flag wing of the Democrats will not vote for aid to the Contras. They know his game. Wipe out the Contras now. Steal the election in Feb\u00ad ruary. RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE (Mr. GLICKMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GLICKMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the minimum wage, but, before I start, I say to the gentle\u00ad man from New Hampshire CMr. DOUG\u00ad LAS], \"before you start talking about the wimp wing of any party, you might ask the Chief Executive of this country about this issue that you just talked about. I don't see him calling for military aid to the Contras at all.\" Mr. Speaker, my message today has to do with the compromise on mini\u00ad mum wage. That is the message that I would like to give. Today we take up that compromise, which is $4.25 over 2 years. While the bill is not perfect, I believe that the American people are grateful to Speaker FOLEY for his te\u00ad naciousness and his persistence in making sure that the minimum wage is raised to levels which are compas\u00ad sionate and which are fair. Working for a living and living in poverty are no longer mutually exclusive condi\u00ad tions. More than 1.1 million families cannot escape poverty, and most of those are on the minimum wage. More than 45 percent of minimum wage workers are heads of households or working women. Many others are col\u00ad lege students who need those jobs just to pay tuition. Mr. Speaker, the last time the mini\u00ad mum wage was raised was in 1981, when it was raised to its present level of $3.35 an hour. Had it kept up with inflation, it would now stand at $4.68. We are raising it to $4.25 over 2 years. Over 85 percent of the American people, according to a Washington Post poll, support an increase in the minimum wage. This is not an abstract issue to make political gain. It is a life and death issue for millions of Ameri\u00ad cans so that they can survive economi\u00ad cally. D 1040 THERE HE GOES AGAIN <Mr. BALLENGER asked and was given permission to address the House November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26791 for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BALLENGER. Mr. Speaker, well, there he goes again, the Marxist dictator Daniel Ortega is showing his true colors by unilaterally halting the cease-fire in place since the signing of the Sapoa accords in March 1988. Daniel Ortega has signed agreement after agreement and made countless promises to the Nicaraguan people, yet he doesn't believe he is bound to uphold his oath. Another day, another lie. As if calling a halt to the cease-fire isn't enough, now, Daniel Ortega is threatening to cancel the February elections. A remarkable 1.8 million Nicaraguans have registered to vote in the upcoming elections, and polls show Daniel Ortega's support may not be there. Now, if you were a military dic\u00ad tator and threatened with your own defeat, would you want to hold those elections? I think it is time this coun\u00ad try stopped trusting habitual lying military dictators. MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE <Mr. BRENNAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENNAN. Mr. Speaker, the minimum wage bill before us today is the best we can do given the Bush ad\u00ad ministration's indifference to the working poor. This bill will raise the minimum wage to $4.25. Because the current minimum has not been increased since '1981, this raise is but a pittance. Could we in this Congress maintain our sense of worth and our hope for a better life if, after 10 years, we were given a raise of only 90 cents an hour? Granted, this modest hike will make life a little better for America's work\u00ad ing poor, but it ignores the greater need: The need to be able to feed and clothe a family, to pay the rent. Worse, this stingy increase ignores the respect for the dignity of the working poor. This House has voted many times to help our more fortunate members of society, most recently with a capital gains tax cut for the wealthy. And what is really bizarre is that, with all the problems we have in America\u00ad drugs, the deficit, nuclear plant clean\u00ad up, our faltering education system\u00ad the top priority of the Bush adminis\u00ad tration is to give a tax break to the su\u00ad perrich. I will support this minimal minimum wage increase today. It is better than nothing. DANIEL ORTEGA HAS BLUNDERED AGAIN <Mr. LAGOMARSINO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Speaker, it should be no surprise that Daniel Ortega has blundered again. Just when you might think he has finally learned how to project the image of a statesman, he shows himself to be nothing more than what he is: a Com\u00ad munist military dictator leading his band of Sandinista incompetents. What Ortega needs is some good advice on how to conduct public rela\u00ad tions. On occasion, in the past, there have been any number of my col\u00ad leagues who have counseled Ortega on what he should do to help influence the outcome of the debate in Congress on United States policy toward Nicara\u00ad gua. I would urge those same Members now to use their influence on Ortega to reverse his decision to cancel the cease-fire with the Contras. If they truly want a political solution to the crisis in Nicaragua, canceling the cease-fire is not the way to accomplish it. EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO DAVID A. BRODY <Mr. CLEMENT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLEMENT. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to pay tribute to David A. Brody for his many years of service to the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith and to his country. Mr. Speaker, my wife, Mary, and I in August had the pleasure of traveling to Israel with David and his wife, Bea. I can attest to David's value as a re\u00ad source for information. David's partici\u00ad pation in the trip helped enormously to better our understanding of the fas\u00ad cinating history and complex politics of this strategically vital area of the world. The trip also allowed me to become a friend to the Brodys. And let me confirm what many of my colleagues already know-both David and Bea are warm, friendly, and unpretentious in\u00ad dividuals. It is clear that their rela\u00ad tionship with Members of Congress is based on the strong personal friend\u00ad ship that develops as much as it is based on philosophy or political ideol\u00ad ogy. David Brody's commitment to civil rights and civil liberties is evident when one talks with him. While he has earned a fine reputation for work\u00ad ing hard on behalf of issues of concern to our Nation's Jewish-American com\u00ad munity, it is his unyielding commit\u00ad ment to the rights of all Americans for which he is best known and most widely respected. The Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith has been well-served during David's stewardship as execu-tive director. Although he retired last February, David continues to be ac\u00ad tively involved in public affairs. Mr. Speaker, many of us here in this institution have come to rely on David Brody's considered judgment and counsel. I know that David's contribu\u00ad tion to the public debate of policy is great. For more than 40 years, he has participated in the deliberations of many of our Nation's greatest civil rights policies. I hope that his partici\u00ad pation continues for the foreseeable future. His insight and wisdom, as well as his warmth and friendship, make him an invaluable guide over the treacherous path that is often before us. Accordingly, it is with great pleasure that I join my colleagues in expressing gratitude to such a distinguished indi\u00ad vidual-David A. Brody. THE NEED FOR QUICK FINAL ACTION ON MEDICARE CATA\u00ad STROPHIC COVERAGE ACT <Mr. MACHTLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MACHTLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today calling for quick final action on the Medicare Catastrophic Health Care Act. We have voted to repeal cat\u00ad astrophic health care, and now we need to end it once and for all. We need to end this unpleasant chapter in our history. I realize that Congress has many im\u00ad portant and difficult issues before it, but the elderly in my district are con\u00ad stantly asking, \"When will you end this process? When will you put an end to this unfair taxation?\" Mr. Speaker, I ask the leadership that controls the agenda to make sure that we complete this action and end catastrophic health care before we recess this year. A NEW PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE <Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, over the past 10 years the working poor had a pledge that goes like this: I pledge allegiance to the minimum wage and all the hardships and misery for which it stands; no raises under Reagan, with food stamps and welfare for all. And that is about how it has really gone. Think about it, 37 million with\u00ad out health insurance, marriages that end up on the rocks, they cannot own a home. Today they are saying to Con\u00ad gress, \"We don't want a handout. We want a hand-up,\" and it is time for a new pledge that goes like this: I pledge allegiance to a new minimum wage and the hope for which it stands, an 26792 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 increase under Bush and Hawkins, with dig\u00ad nity and opportunity for all. Think about it. DANIEL ORTEGA'S FEAR OF FREE ELECTIONS (Mr. DREIER of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DREIER of California. Mr. Speaker, the prospect of seeing Violeta Chamorro and Virgilio Godoy, repre\u00ad sentatives of the 14-member union of Nicaraguan opposition, an opposition which ranges from the Communist party all the way to the most conserv\u00ad ative, the threat of their victory has led Daniel Ortega to some of the most incredible statements this morning imaginable. Listen to what he said, Mr. Speaker. He said that George Bush is supporting terrorism in Nicaragua. Now, last June I stood over the larg\u00ad est cache of weapons that Ortega has sent into El Salvador, and he is now accusing George Bush of supporting terrorism in Nicaragua. He said, \"The United States of America is attempting to put another star on our flag with Nicaragua.\" And he said when looking at the prospect of an election next February 25, he had not decided whether or not it will take place. He said, \"It is up to the Yankee President and the Yankee Congress.'' Well, this kind of rhetoric cannot go unchecked, Mr. Speaker. We have got to recognize that we are the ones who are supporting democracy. We have got to hold Ortega to the fire. THE ARMY'S \"QUICK LOOK PROGRAM\" <Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speak\u00ad er, I rise today to bring to the atten\u00ad tion of my colleagues some informa\u00ad tion about a special orientation pro\u00ad gram provided for Members by the De\u00ad partment of the Army. It is the Army's Quicklook Program which is sponsored by the Secretary of the Army to have Members of Congress see firsthand the capabilities of our Army to meet a threat and better un\u00ad derstand the needs of our Army in Germany and throughout Europe. It was a great experience for me and I encourage my colleagues to participate if they have not done so already. Our officers, noncommissioned offi\u00ad cers, and soldiers are doing a great job meeting many of the challenges posed by serving overseas. The training I saw in Grafenwohr was exciting, realistic, and effective. In the border town of Hof, cavalry soldiers were doing a great job executing their border sur-veillance mission. The maintenance of equipment and facilities is being better managed and accomplished through the use of up-to-date computer equip\u00ad ment and sound management princi\u00ad ples. I saw this in Germersheim where our storage facilities and military equipment are stored. I also visited our military community of Hanau which supports a population of over 30,000 soldiers and their dependents. Today I would also like to say a spe\u00ad cial thanks to those who had a major role in making my trip such an inform\u00ad ative one and I would like to share their names with my colleagues: Lt. Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Deputy Commander in Chief, U.S. Army Europe and 7th Army. Brig. Gen. John H. Tilelli, Jr., Com\u00ad manding General, 7th Army Training Command. Brig. Gen. James R. Harding, Assist\u00ad ant Division Commander, 3rd Armored Division. Brig. Gen. Johnnie E. Wilson, Deputy Commanding General, 21st Theater Army Area Command. Col. John E. Counts, Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Berlin. Col. Leonard D. Holder, Command\u00ad er, 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment. Lt. Col. Thomas A. Dunn, Headquar\u00ad ters, Combat Equipment Group Europe. Lt. Col. Larry E. Fuege, Commander, General Support Center Germer\u00ad shelm. 1st. Lt. Bjorn Anderson, Headquar\u00ad ters, U.S. Army Berlin. Mr. Speaker, this was an excellent trip that has certainly given me a better understanding of our Army's European mission, our soldiers, and the difficult challenges they face espe\u00ad cially when serving overseas. THE NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS <Mr. GOSS asked and was given per\u00ad mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GOSS. Mr. Speaker, this morn\u00ad ing's news about Daniel Ortega and his plans to scuttle both the cease-fire in Nicaragua and the upcoming elec\u00ad tions does not surprise me, and I doubt it surprises many of my colleagues. Now we have heard that the recent election polls show UNO candidate Violeta Chamorro leading, and Daniel Ortega is worried. He is playing high stake games. He is now pulling out his wild cards to forestall democracy's chances. Several months ago I introduced in this House and this House passed the Goss amendment to the foreign aid bill, which talked about standards for free and fair elections in Nicaragua. Many of our colleagues have traveled to Nicaragua these past few months to observe the process, and I think were encouraged by the progress being made. Democratic activities were be\u00ad ginning to flourish, but now the whole world can observe clearly how un\u00ad trustworthy Ortega really is. He is a totalitarian dictator. He is a self-pro\u00ad claimed Marxist, and none of us should forget that. If the spots on the leopard cannot be changed, then perhaps it is time to change the leopard. D 1050 HEARINGS ON WORKPLACE LITERACY (Mr. PRICE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PRICE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Science Committee's Science, Re\u00ad search and Technology Subcommittee, chaired by Representative DouG WAL\u00ad GREN, conducted a hearing on science and mathematics education and work\u00ad place literacy. The hearing focused on H.R. 3122, the Science and Technolog\u00ad ical Literacy Act of 1989, legislation I introduced with bipartisan cosponsor\u00ad ship last summer. A key strength of the American economy is its work force. Unfortu\u00ad nately, there is clear evidence that the technical abilities of the work force are falling below the technical needs of the economy. This shortage of skilled workers is emerging as a criti\u00ad cal barrier to economic progress and our competitiveness in the global econ\u00ad omy. The economic health of this country depends on our ability to train our people for the offices, factories, and laboratories of tomorrow. In order to meet this need for a skilled work force that can read, write, analyze, operate a computer or read a technical manual, the U.S. education system must be re\u00ad tooled. Our hearing was effectively opened with a forceful and insightful state\u00ad ment by our former North Carolina Governor, Jim Hunt. Federal agency representatives described programs al\u00ad ready underway to improve science and math education and work force training, but I believe that their testi\u00ad mony left most of us convinced of the need for intensified efforts and for im\u00ad proved coordination and collaboration among agencies. We also heard from people on the cutting edge of science education and workplace literacy training, and discussed the importance of disseminating more widely the ap\u00ad proaches and materials developed in programs like theirs. Business leaders from across the country spoke of their own training needs, the steps they had taken to fill them, and the need to im\u00ad prove the capacities of our community colleges for technical training. This bipartisan effort in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee is November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26793 complemented by the work underway in the Education and Labor Commit\u00ad tee led by Representative TOM SA WYER, who participated in our hear\u00ad ing yesterday. The initiatives taken by these committees are highly encourag\u00ad ing, suggesting a widely felt need in this body to close the ominous gap be\u00ad tween what the workplace requires and the skills and training our people are bringing to the workplace. I very much hope that we can continue to progress toward enacting legislation that will upgrade and improve the Federal contribution to this effort. TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE JAMIE WHITTEN <Mr. BROOMFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, Congress will have been the beneficiary of 48 full years of the vigor and vision of one of its finest Members. JAMIE WHITTEN, the dean of the Mis\u00ad sissippi delegation, the dean of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the dean of the entire U.S. Congress, will celebrate 48 years of distinguished service. JAMIE has contributed to the flesh and blood struggles that have pro\u00ad duced almost a half-century of legisla\u00ad tion. Without the kind of institutional experience that men and women like JAMIE offer, we simply couldn't cope with the vast array of issues that come before us. JAMIE has been a real leader. He has gained the respect of his fellow Mem\u00ad bers through his hard work, his pene\u00ad trating mind, and his gracious person\u00ad ality. This great House has been fortu\u00ad nate to have him. I wish him many more years of service and good health. TEAR DOWN THE BERLIN WALL <Mr. APPLEGATE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. APPLEGATE. Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud President Bush and Secretary Gorbachev for meeting in December, and I think this is good. But no summit? Just to get to know each other a little bit better? That is nuts. I think they ought to get together and talk about substance. They have already met several times, so they know each other. Secretary Gorbachev knows that the Soviet Union's economic structure is on the brink of disaster, and he needs the United States' help, and he wants support, but not to the degree that they should be talking that we are going to give away the store as hap\u00ad pened over the last 8 years with the Japanese. If Mr. Gorbachev wants to show good faith, wants to talk about peres\u00ad troika and glasnost, talk about free\u00ad dom for his people, then let him tear down the Berlin Wall. That is the thing that he ought to be talking about. That is the substance of this meeting. Show good faith: tear down the Berlin Wall. OILSPILL BILL STRIPS AWAY FUNDAMENTAL STATES RIGHTS <Mr. SMITH of Vermont asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Vermont. Mr. Speak\u00ad er, I come from the State of Vermont, where for as many years as I can re\u00ad member the environment has been our most precious national trust. For that reason alone, under other circum\u00ad stances I would be standing here ap\u00ad plauding the oilspill bill we have before us today. It is badly needed, and it is long overdue. What is not needed, however, is Fed\u00ad eral legislation that takes away the rights of individual States to set their own stricter standards. What is good for Vermont is not necessarily good for any other State, and the Federal Government should not stand in the way of States to make judgments about whether stricter environmental protections are in order. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is very similar to a bill which I introduced earlier this year, but I cannot support the preemption position in the bill before us. It strips away the funda\u00ad mental rights of States to establish standards that may be far better and more badly needed, and not uninciden\u00ad tally it also strips away an avenue of action which many States have begun to take to band together for stronger environmental standards, and in so doing move this Congress to long-over\u00ad due and badly needed action. THE MINIMUM WAGE <Mrs. UNSOELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. UNSOELD. Mr. Speaker, al\u00ad though the President vetoed the mini\u00ad mum wage package passed by Con\u00ad gress, he thought a pay raise was urgent for high-level Government offi\u00ad cials. He said the pay of senior Gov\u00ad ernment officials has eroded signifi\u00ad cantly. Mr. Speaker, I ask that the Presi\u00ad dent be reminded that since January 1981 the minimum wage has remained frozen, contributing to the scandalous neglect of hard-working Americans, the working poor, and the working homeless. In 1987, 8.4 million Americans worked for a living, but lived in pover-ty. The U.S. Conference of Mayors es\u00ad timated that last year 22 percent of the homeless people actually held full\u00ad time or part-time jobs. I support the minimum wage com\u00ad promise before us today although it will not even bring the working poor up to that level that inflation has robbed them. The President's appre\u00ad ciation for working America unfortu\u00ad nately extends no further. DO NOT LET ORTEGA MAKE FOOLS OF AMERICA (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, Daniel Ortega and his gang of thugs are again thumbing their nose at the cause of democracy and peace in this hemisphere. He has made fools out of the left wing of the Democratic Party, and we should not let him make fools out of America. Whether there is peace in Central America or freedom in Nicaragua should not be based on the good will of a man who is willing to give up peace as he has done and to attack his enemies with military might as he has proclaimed he will do. What progress has been made toward democracy in Nicaragua has been won by those who have been willing to fight for their freedom; namely, the Contras, the freedom fighters, and with Daniel Or\u00ad tega's announcement, the United States should seriously consider re\u00ad suming military aid to those freedom fighters if we are to have peace and freedom in Central America and this hemisphere. Let us not let Daniel Ortega make fools out of America. THE 1990's ARE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY <Mrs. SCHROEDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, it is November 1. There are only 2 months left in calendar year 1989, which means we are almost to the 1990's, and fiscally we are already there. I think the 1980's all swirled around the window of vulnerability. The ad\u00ad ministration said there was a window of vulnerability, we must run out and procure every kind of weapon, do any\u00ad thing, ask no questions, pay any price, this is what we must do. I think the 1990's are whirling around a window of opportunity. It ap\u00ad pears to be open. I am very pleased that President Bush and Secretary Gorbachev will be meeting this De\u00ad cember, but I hope it is more than a 26794 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 getting-to-know-you meeting. I hope it is something of where we go in the 1990's, to really lower the level of nu\u00ad clear terror on the planet, to lower the level of weapons and confrontation, to figure out how we get our economies back on course. Let us look at this new window that is open and let us hope that the Presi\u00ad dent is much more creative with many more ideas than we have seen in the past. Does the President know that the infant mortality rate has increased over 50 percent in the first half of the year because of drug abuse amongst pregnant girls and women? Why then, would a President who says he values human life above all else veto funds for a program to treat pregnant ad\u00ad dicts and provide for their unborn children. I ask, is the war on drugs for real, or will the President let politics rule? ORTEGA: FOUL SUBSTANCE D 1100 FLOATING IN THE PUNCH- D.C. APPROPRIATIONS VETO- BOWL OF LIBERTY THE PRESIDENT ACTED ON <Mr. DORNAN of California asked PRINCIPLE and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DORNAN of California. Mr. Speaker, there he is, Ortega, a foul substance floating in the punchbowl of liberty. One of my Democratic colleagues said that this man must be a secret Republican, because every time his Democratic friends try to help him out he kicks them in the face. I can assure the Members he is no Republican. To paraphrase our courageous Presi\u00ad dent, he is a foul odor at the garden party of freedom. He is the Noriega of Nicaragua. There he is, Ortega, el Nor\u00ad iega y Nicaragua. When are we going to do something to squish this ugly substance in our hemisphere, Boy Scout uniform not\u00ad withstanding? D.C. APPROPRIATIONS VETO <Mr. RICHARDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I am very puzzled by President Bush's recent veto of the D.C. appropriations bill. President Bush and his appointed drug czar, William Bennett, told us they wanted to free our streets of the scourge of drugs. And that they wanted to start right here in the Na\u00ad tion's Capital. President Bush said he wanted Lafayette Park drug free. Why would he vetd a bill which in\u00ad cludes $32 million for the war on drugs in the Nation's Capital? Why did he veto 700 additional police officers, ad\u00ad ditional judges, and support staff? President Bush says he wants the rap\u00ad ists and drug pushers in jail, but he vetoed legislation which would build two new prisons to put as many as 1,800 criminals behind bars. President Bush, the education Presi\u00ad dent, vetoed $1.8 million for drug pre\u00ad vention programs and $1.3 million for a far reaching program to enhance and expand after school activities for school children growing up in our Na\u00ad tion's Capital. Is this what an educa\u00ad tion President does? <Mr. SMITH of New Jersey asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. SMITH] misspoke this morning when he suggested that taxpayers' funds are used in the District of Co\u00ad lumbia to pay for abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother. The fact of the matter is D.C. funds, which are appropriated by Con\u00ad gress, pay for abortion on demand; that is a fact. I would also say to my friend from Florida, President Bush is not hung up, as he put it, on the issue of abortion. The President is deeply committed to protecting and preserv\u00ad ing human life. He is acting on princi\u00ad ple, and I respect that. Mr. Speaker, the President is com\u00ad mitted to saving the lives of children from the abortionist's scalpel. As more Americans discover the gruesome methods of abortion, including literal dismemberment and chemical poison\u00ad ing, they will applaud the President. Abortion on demand, Mr. Speaker, is child abuse; it kills children. The President was correct to veto the D.C. appropriations bill. JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS-THE FAULT LIES WITH THE CON\u00ad GRESS <Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, yester\u00ad day during these opening remarks an\u00ad other Member, whom I like very much, blamed former President Reagan for the fact that the Japanese bought Rockefeller Center and many other United States businesses and property. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully disagree. The fault lies with the Congress. It is the Congress that has become too lib\u00ad eral, that has run up our huge deficits and national debt. It is the Congress that has refused to balance the budget and even come close to holding the line on Federal spending. We have recently passed ap-propriation bills giving various depart\u00ad ments 13, 15, 18 percent increases. Federal spending has run three or four times the rate of inflation over the last 8 years because the Congress has tried to be all things to all people. Really we have ended up hurting the very people we are trying to help. Our deficits and the huge national debt have kept our interest rates 5 or 6 percent higher than any other devel\u00ad oped nation. When you give someone a 5 or 6 percent head start in business, you have given them the whole ball game. Really it is a wonder to me that for\u00ad eign companies have not bought more American businesses and properties. I hope that we will try to bring down our interest rates so that we can level the playing field and allow our people to compete on equal terms with those from foreign countries. END OF THE CEASE-FIRE IN NICARAGUA <Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thought Halloween was over, but it sure looks like the trick is on us, again. Once again, Daniel Ortega has intro\u00ad duced us to his brand of commitment to peace in Central America by declar\u00ad ing the Sandinista truce with the Con\u00ad tras ended. I don't like to think what this means for the elections scheduled for Febru\u00ad ary, but it must surely be plain to ev\u00ad eryone now how little faith can be placed in the word of Daniel Ortega. By outrageously announcing his planned end of the cease-fire at last week's peace summit, he unmistakably showed the world his arrogant disre\u00ad gard for the long-sought peace in the region-a peace desperately desired not only by the United States, but by his neighbors: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras. Mr. Speaker, Daniel Ortega has played yet another card from his deck of deceit and this time if another elec\u00ad tion is stolen from the people in Cen\u00ad tral America, the United States will have missed its golden opportunity to roll back communism in our hemi\u00ad sphere. Yes, the trick most certainly is on us. ORTEGA'S UNILATERAL DECI- SION TO RESTART WAR AGAINST NICARAGUAN PEOPLE <Mr. COX asked and was given per\u00ad mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26795 Mr. COX. Mr. Speaker, this morning at 6 a.m. in Managua, left-wing dicta\u00ad tor Ortega shocked the world when he announced that he will enforce his rule upon the Nicaraguan people by literally murdering the opposition. Ortega's unilateral decision to re\u00ad start his war against the Nicaraguan people flies in the face of the Sapoa accord that he signed only last year. Obviously Commandante Ortega has become jealous that nearby narco-dic\u00ad tator Manuel Noriega has become the most hated figure in Latin America. He is bidding, himself, for this title. And I think this morning's outrageous action probably is sufficient to win it for him. Ortega's blatant disdain for the peace process was evident last week when he ruined the hemispheric summit hosted by Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias. The Arias peace plan now is in a shambles. Ortega obviously has been reading the Gallup polls which show him losing badly to Violeta Chamorra. Just like Noriega, Ortega has decided to call off democracy. In his inaugural address last year, President Bush said that the day of the dictator is over. That should be the case, that Danny Ortega's day is over. DANIEL ORTEGA HAS DOUBLE\u00ad CROSSED US AGAIN <Mr. GEKAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, yes, Daniel Ortega has double-crossed us. Not just the Ameri\u00ad can people, not just the Congress of the United States, not just the world community, but he has double-crossed the people of Nicaragua, themselves. And they soon will realize what has happened. But what is worse in this whole scene of betrayal on the part of Daniel Ortega is the fact that he gains en\u00ad couragement for his acts from the well of this very House, from the House of Representatives, from the Congress of the United States. Why? Because speaker after speaker over a period of 7 or 8 years now has encour\u00ad aged Ortega by saying that the Con\u00ad gress will not support his political op\u00ad position in the country of Nicaragua, will not allow us to support the con\u00ad tras who want to resist the kind of di\u00ad catorship which these very same speakers say that the President was wrong in defying in Panama. These very same proponents, sup\u00ad porters of Ortega on the floor of the House. RECEDING AND CONCURRING IN SENATE AMENDMENT 136 TO H.R. 3015, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELAT\u00ad ED AGENCIES APPROPRIA\u00ad TIONS ACT, 1990, WITH AN AMENDMENT Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, by direc\u00ad tion of the Committee on Rules I call up House Resolution 276 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol\u00ad lows: H. RES. 276 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider a motion, if offered by Representative Whit\u00ad ten of Mississippi, or his designee, to recede and concur in Senate amendment numbered 136 to the bill <H.R. 3015) making appro\u00ad priations for the Department of Transporta\u00ad tion and Related Agencies, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1990, and for other purposes, with the amendment print\u00ad ed in the joint statement of the managers accompanying the conference report on H.R. 3015, and all points of order against said motion for failure to comply with the provisions of section 302(f) of the Congres\u00ad sional Budget Act of 1984, as amended <Public Law 93-344, as amended by Public Law 99-177) are hereby waived. The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mr. DERRICK). The gentleman from Texas [Mr. FROST] is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, for pur\u00ad poses of debate only, I yield the cus\u00ad tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from California [Mr. PASHAYAN] pend\u00ad ing which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 276 makes it in order for the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Representative WHITTEN, or his desig\u00ad nee to move to recede and concur with an amendment to Senate amendment No. 136 to H.R. 3015-the Department of Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1990. The rule waives section 302<0 of the Congressional Budget Act against the motion. Mr. Speaker, the motion to be of\u00ad fered under the provisions of this rule will permit the House to vote on rec\u00ad ommendations of the conferees to pro\u00ad vide for additional funding for the war on drugs. The drug package contained in the motion to be offered by the chairman of the Appropriations Com\u00ad mittee would add nearly $3.2 billion in additional funding for the war on drugs for fiscal year 1990. Additional funds under the package are to be available for programs under the De\u00ad partments of Justice, Interior, Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Veterans' Affairs to fight the scourge of the illicit drug trade. Because a number of the programs funded under the bill are not in the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Transportation and were not anticipated in the alloca\u00ad tion given to the subcommittee, the motion would cause the subcommit-tee's section 302(b) allocation of budget authority to be exceeded for fiscal year 1990. Section 302(f) of the Budget Act would prohibit the consid\u00ad eration of Chairman WHITTEN's motion because it does not comply with the subcommittee's allocation of budget authority and therefore the waiver contained in this rule is re\u00ad quired. Mr. Speaker, the emergency drug funding package recommended by the conferees is deficit neutral. All new budget authority contained in the package is offset by reductions in other categories of spending. Mr. Speaker, the package has wide\u00ad spread bipartisan support. The rule is necessary to permit the drug funding package and the Transportation Ap\u00ad propriations bill to move forward. I urge adoption of the rule and of Chairman WHITTEN's motion. 0 1110 Mr. PASHAYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con\u00ad sume. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 276 is a rule that makes in order a motion under which the House can complete action on $3.2 billion in budget author\u00ad ity for emergency antidrug funding. The rule makes in order a motion to recede and concur in Senate amend\u00ad ment 136 to the Department of Trans\u00ad portation Appropriations Act, H.R. 3015. The rule provides a waiver of section 302<0 of the Budget Act against con\u00ad sideration of the motion, which will be offered by the chairman of the Com\u00ad mittee on Appropriations, the gentle\u00ad man from Mississippi, Representative WHITTEN or his designee. Mr. Speaker, this rule will be neces\u00ad sary if the House shall complete action on the pending conference report and send it to the Senate for final action. Mr. Speaker, the House agreed yes\u00ad terday to the conference report on H.R. 3015. When the time came for a motion to concur in Senate amend\u00ad ment 136. The gentleman from Minnesota, the ranking Republican member of the Committee on the Budget, Mr. FREN\u00ad ZEL, then made a point of order, which the chair sustained, that the funds provided in the emergency drug sup\u00ad plemental appropriations caused the Transportation Subcommittee to exceed its section 302(b) allocation for discretionary budget authority. Mr. Speaker, no one disputes the fact that providing new budget au\u00ad thority for antidrug spending within the Department of Transportation Ap\u00ad propriations Act is a highly unusual way for the Congress to react to an emergency situation. No one disputes the fact that section 302<0 of the Budget Act is a mecha-26796 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 nism whereby the House can enforce the budget priorities it has set in the budget resolution, by holding the vari\u00ad ous Appropriations Subcommittees to discretionary spending limits set in ac\u00ad cordance with section 302<b> of the Budget Act. Mr. Speaker, this rule is yet another recognition that the Budget Act is not flexible enough to accommodate timely action by the Congress on ur\u00ad gently needed spending for national priorities. Mr. Speaker, this rule will permit House consideration of the conferees recommendation for $3.2 in emergency drug funding. This level is $900 million more than the President's request, and increases this year's annual outlays for antidrug efforts by $1.2 billion. The conferees recommendation in\u00ad creases funding for education, preven\u00ad tion, and treatment by $800 million and law enforcement by $100 million above the President's request. Mr. Speaker, the conferees also rec\u00ad ommend specific reductions in each of the regular appropriations bills in order to offset the $3.4 billion increase in budget authority for antidrug fund\u00ad ing. Mr. Speaker, the conferees have de\u00ad veloped a responsible funding package for antidrug spending, and the House deserves the opportunity to vote on the package. Adoption of the rule is the necessary first step. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, for pur\u00ad poses of debate only, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Budget, the gentle\u00ad man from California [Mr. PANETTA]. Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, yester\u00ad day the House adopted the conference report on the bill H.R. 3015, providing funds for the Department of Trans\u00ad portation and related agencies. Addi\u00ad tionally, a point of order was sustained against consideration of amendment No. 136 which provides emergency drug funding, with some offsets, of $3,012 million in budget authority and $1,073 million in outlays. The point of order on section 302(f) of the Budget Act was sustained because with adop\u00ad tion of emergency drug funding the Transportation Subcommittee would exceed its 302<b) subdivision by $2,113 million in budget authority and $293 million in outlays. The Appropriations Committee has since received a rule waiving this Budget Act point of order. I believe this was the proper procedure to take and I support the waiver. Mr. Speaker, although adoption in emergency drug funding under amend\u00ad ment No. 136 would cause the subcom\u00ad mittee to exceed its subdivision, there are several legitimate reasons for this. First, the Transportation Subcommit\u00ad tee was scored for $1 billion in disaster assistance provided in the second con\u00ad tinuing resolution. I supported allow-ing these additional funds because of their emergency nature. It is also my understanding and ex\u00ad pectation that appropriation confer\u00ad ence reports already enacted, coupled with emergency drug funding as part of this conference report, and the dis\u00ad cretionary spending contained in other appropriation conference reports not yet considered; namely, Defense, Agri\u00ad culture, and Foreign Operations, ex\u00ad cluding disaster assistance, will result in the House Appropriations Commit\u00ad tee's overall allocation for discretion\u00ad ary budget authority and outlays to be met. In making this determination, I have compared the current 302(b) sub\u00ad divisions with the status of conference reports already adopted, this confer\u00ad ence report with the adoption of the emergency drug funding amendment, the expected amounts for remaining - conference reports, and the disaster assistance provided in the second con\u00ad tinuing resolution. The result of this calculation shows the House Appro\u00ad priations Committee will be well under its section 302<a> allocation for discre\u00ad tionary budget authority and exactly on target for discretionary outlays. In light of these considerations, I urge my colleagues to support the nec\u00ad essary Budget Act waiver for this amendment. Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude by saying, as I have said time and time again, we are going to face these prior\u00ad ities, if not now, in the future, wheth\u00ad er it is drugs, whether it is disaster as\u00ad sistance, whether it is defense, wheth\u00ad er it is education, whether it is health care, we are a Nation that is starving for resources right now. Until we con\u00ad front the principal issue of how we re\u00ad store those resources, whether it be through revenues, whether it be through additional cuts in spending, until we face those tough choices, we have very little alternative but to con\u00ad tinue to provide these kinds of waiv\u00ad ers. [In millions of dollars] Current House status over ( +) under (-) 302(b) subdivisions Current House Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolu\u00ad tion. The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. MOTION OFFERED BY MR. WHITTEN Mr. WHITTEN. Mr. Speaker, pursu\u00ad ant to House Resolution 276, I off er a motion. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. WHITTEN moves that the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate numberd 136 and concur therein with an amendment, as follows: In lieu of the matter proposed by said amendment, insert the following: TITLE IV-EMERGENCY DRUG FUNDING CHAPTER I DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES For carrying out efforts at National Drug Control and the President's initiative to combat violent crime, $10,261,000 to en\u00ad hance drug and criminal law enforcement efforts with special emphasis on improving drug law enforcement efforts among the various Justice Department agencies and on expedited deportation proceedings of con\u00ad victed criminal aliens.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. For the text of Senate amendment No. 136, see proceedings of the House of Tuesday, October 31, 1989, at page H 7790, H 7791, and H 7792. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. WHITTEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their re\u00ad marks and include therein extraneous material on the disposition of Senate amendment No. 136 to H.R. 3015, and that I be permitted to include tabular and extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mr. DERRICK). Is there objection to the re\u00ad quest of the gentleman from Mississip\u00ad pi? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. WHITTEN] will be recognized for 30 minutes, and the gentleman from Mas\u00ad sachusetts [Mr. CONTE] will be recog\u00ad nized for 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. WHITTEN]. Mr. WHITTEN. Mr. Speaker, amendment No. 136 now before Mem\u00ad bers is deficit neutral. We provided, in order to conform to the budget agree\u00ad ment before the leadership and the executive and to not violate the deficit target for fiscal 1990 that sufficient cuts are made elsewhere to offset ex\u00ad penditure provided here. I say this, advising my good friend, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, and he is a friend, his state\u00ad ment reminds me of an old story I read in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in which it said, \"So let your life be ordered by each docu\u00ad mented fact and die of malnutrition but with arteries intact.\" So we can have a balanced budget and a whole lot of other things, but if this is at the expense of destroying our own country and our economy, what have we ac\u00ad complished? I point out since 1974 when we passed the Budget Act and started trying to deal with appropria\u00ad tions and not dealing with the income and other things, entitlements and back door spending has increased 4. 7 times. We on Appropriations have tried to live within what is left. We have been below the budget. I have pointed out repeatedly that since 1945 our appro\u00ad priation bills have been $187 billion below the recommendations of the Presidents. Not only that, but under President Reagan we were $16 billion below. D 1120 We are reaching the point now, where it is being insisted that we stop things that are vital to our country in order to have a balanced budget and all the other things demanded under present rules. May I say again, we have lived with that in this bill, because it is deficit neutral. We have provided for suffi\u00ad cient cuts it is deficit neutral. We have provided for sufficient cuts to cover the outlays that will result from the anti-drug funds provided in this bill. Mr. Speaker, this drug business is far more dangerous, in my mind, than anything we have ever faced in our country. It is destroying our country. Everyday we read in the papers about murders in the city of Washing\u00ad ton. We read about it all over the country. It reaches every crossroad. As a prosecuting attorney with a dis\u00ad trict attorney background, I have in\u00ad sisted from the start that we cannot handle this matter until we go to work on the cause, the origin of it. NEED FOR A PLAN AND A COORDINATOR WITH AUTHORITY I pointed out in 1986 we appropri\u00ad ated a $1.6 billion supplemental before there was any authority. Of course, in the appropriation of it we provided the authority. But that was also before we had any recommendation from the President and before we had any change in law. In fact in section 107 of Public Law 99-464 we had di\u00ad rected them to use $100,000 to come up with a plan and to provide that plan no later than January l, 1987. We are still waiting for that plan. That language follows: DRUG COORDINATION PLAN SEC. 107. Pending the enactment of the Omnibus Drug Supplemental Appropria\u00ad tions Act of 1987, contained as Title II of the fiscal year 1987 Continuing Appropria\u00ad tions Act of 1987 <H.J. Res. 738), the Presi\u00ad dent or his designee shall, out of the $1,200,000,000 made available for drug abuse prevention programs by House Joint Reso\u00ad lution 738 and continued by this resolution and in the regular appropriations bills for 26800 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 the fiscal year 1987, with the cooperation of those presently engaged in this effort in the executive departments, Members of Con\u00ad gress and others experienced in the field of law enforcement, use $100,000 to develop an overall drug abuse prevention plan that co\u00ad ordinates the government's efforts in com\u00ad bating the widespread use of illegal drugs: Provided, That this plan shall be presented to the Congress no later than January 1, 1987. Last year, in support of the funding for the drug plan I pointed out: In fiscal years 1986, 1987, and 1988, we provided a total of $9.5 billion to meet what perhaps is the greatest danger to happen to this country. Not only that, but the first $1.6 billion that we appropriated as a supplemental in fiscal year 1987, we did before we had an authorization and in the process made it authorized. At that time we called on the President to use $100,000 of available funds to come up with a plan. Mr. Speaker, I say again that we owe a lot to all the people that got together to bring this about, but it does point out that we have to have a plan of procedure because 41 different Government agencies are in on the money that we have appropriated, and it took a great effort on the part of those who authorize those programs to get together on this bill. NEED FOR COORDINATION PLAN The problem is not simply lack of money or organizations dealing with the problem. Increased funding has been appropriated to 41 Federal departments and agencies and their respective components since fiscal year 1980 when just under $1 billion was available. In fiscal years 1986, 1987, and 1988, the Committee and Congress provided a total of over $9.5 billion in funding Gov\u00ad ernment wide to address the drug problem. But this is war, and to fight a war effec\u00ad tively, we must have an overall plan which includes organizing the available programs and resources to meet an overall goal. The departments and agencies responsible for those multiple programs have done as well as they can, but the overlapping Federal, State, and local jurisdictions need to effec\u00ad tively coordinate activities to reduce the supply of, and the demand for, drugs in this country. NEED FOR A COORDINATOR WITH AUTHORITY An overall coordinator is necessary to deal with this national emergency. The investi\u00ad gative staff report describes how there is no single person or organization to insure that a coherent, coordinated Federal plan is de\u00ad veloped and carried out. The National Drug Policy Board has developed its nine imple\u00ad mentation plans, but it does not have the authority to cut across jurisdictional lines to ensure that these, or any other plans are carried out. Without an overall plan and a coor\u00ad dinator to make sure the plan is carried out, we have no guarantee that all the programs that can contribute to an agreed upon na\u00ad tional policy are in place and working to\u00ad gether to best satisfy that policy goal. For example, increases in law enforcement fund\u00ad ing for the FBI, DEA, and the Customs Service have resulted in greater numbers of cases for prosecution. Yet, we have short\u00ad ages of U.S. attorneys to prosecute those cases and significant shortages of prison space to house those convicted. As a short\u00ad term fix, we see tr c recent proposal to fine those guilty of possession without criminal prosecution, . Earlier this year, in the dire emer\u00ad gency supplemental <Public Law 101- 45) in order to strengthen Federal do\u00ad mestic drug law enforcement at the local level, $71,000,000 was appropri\u00ad ated for: Additional assistant United States at\u00ad torneys, deputy United States marshals and other agents, including necessary equipment and supplies; initiate plans to acquire avail\u00ad able military facilities for use as prisons or Civilian Conservation Corps type use for drug offenders, speed up planning for not less than three prisons in areas where most needed; and to expedite the purchase of automatic data processing equipment to im\u00ad prove the exchange of information, . And $4,000,000 for fees of jurors and commissioners. Mr. Speaker, may I say this: The money that we have here, that is so es\u00ad sential, if we are to do anything about the problem. NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED We have 41 departments and agen\u00ad cies that have a share of the jurisdic\u00ad tion. Not only that, but we have 50 States that want to get in on the money, and may I say every bit of it is needed. It will be well used. But this money here does nothing that would in any way stop and cor\u00ad rect the causes and get us to where we want to be. We need to give our atten\u00ad tion to establishing a detailed plan and carrying out that plan if we want to get anything done about the problem. Mr. Speaker, our committee had the hearing where we had the so-called crime czar, who calls himself a direc\u00ad tor testify. Not only that, but we also had the Attorney General and the Budget Director present at that hear\u00ad ing. We do not have a czar. He calls him\u00ad self a director. He can issue statements and he can make a wonderful contri\u00ad bution, but is without any experience or background in the area of enforcing the law. Until we have someone in charge, who can cut across lines, we will continue to be slow in making progress. SENATE AMENDMENT NO. 136 Mr. Speaker, this deficit neutral amendment provides $3,183,240,000 for emergency drug funding, which, when added to the $6.5 billion that has been or will be provided in the regular ap\u00ad propriations bills, provides a total of $9.8 billion in fiscal year 1990 to try to get a handle on one of the greatest problems that our Nation or any nation in the history has ever faced\u00ad the scourge of drug abuse. The country is faced with a break\u00ad down in law and order. We are up against what I think is one of the most dangerous situations in the history of the world. Illegal drug use has reached every crossroad in the country. It has gone beyond the cities. There is no way to satisfy those who are request\u00ad ing funds to fight the problem. Grant\u00ad ed, they use it well, and the need is there, but until there is a detailed plan, it may do nothing toward cor\u00ad recting the cause or the source of the problem. The problem is not simply lack of money or organizations dealing with the problem. It is lack of a plan, as we have tried to point out in 1986, 1987, 1988, and in 1989. May I digress a little bit and say that in order to deal with the damages caused by the earthquake that we had in California and the hurricane in the Carolinas, we stepped in and realized that we had to pull together or else we would have any efforts to take care of those disasters divided between so many committees and jurisdictions that we would be 2 or 3 years getting authorized to take care of it. But this is war, and to fight this war effectively we must implement an overall plan. The 41 Federal depart\u00ad ments and agencies responsible for those multiple programs have done as well as they can, but the overlapping Federal, State, and local programs to reduce the supply of and the demand for drugs in this country requires a central control, with authority to cross jurisdictions. We need more than coordination. We need operational ability in law en\u00ad forcement, though education must follow with strong leadership and cen\u00ad tral authority to carry out the plan. We must guarantee that all the pro\u00ad grams that can contribute to an agreed upon national drug policy are under a central control if we are to reach our goal. In addition, it is important to stress, and they have not done it despite the fact that we provided for it and direct\u00ad ed it in our supplemental appropria\u00ad tion bill, the use of available military facilities for use as provisions, or, as proposed in H.R. 1591 and Public Law 101-45, the 1989 dire supplemental, for use as Civilian Conservation Corps\u00ad type camps for .drug offenders. I point out again, that is the one place before this where we provided for paying jurors, assistant prosecuting attorneys, specifically for drug related law en\u00ad forcement at the local level, and all those other things that are essential if we are going to handle this problem. Mr. Speaker, let me repeat, in my opinion, with my background, and I have pointed this out 3 or 4 straight years, we are going to have to look where the source comes from, which means the big money in it. We saw in the paper and on televi\u00ad sion that $10 million was found in California. They could look to see when that left the Bureau of Engrav\u00ad ing and Printing. They could see where it was sent. They could see what Federal Reserve Bank asked for it. They could trace that money all the way to where it was finally distributed. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26801 Unless we persuade the executive branch and the Congress to come up with a plan, as we have tried for 3 or 4 years, we will continue to dish out money trying to deal with the end re\u00ad sults. And, we must continue doing that. This money will be well spent, but it does not do anything toward stopping what is going on. Mr. Speaker, I repeat, this amend\u00ad ment is deficit neutral. We are re\u00ad quired under our rules to cut suffi\u00ad cient things to take care of it, and that is peanuts, compared to the danger that this country faces. This problem is destroying our morals. It is destroy\u00ad ing life in Washington, DC, and set\u00ad ting an all-time record for murders. We see it on television here, and they do not show one-tenth of it. Mr. Speaker, I say again, we are doing our very best to meet this, but I call again, as I have for 4 years, on the executive branch to come up with a detailed plan. We had before us the Attorney Gen\u00ad eral of the United States. We had the Budget Director. We had Mr. Bennett. Mr. Bennett in his testimony says he is not a czar, he is a director, and is doing a good job within the limits of his authority. But anyone that has to deal with 41 departments and agencies has got to have authority to cut across jurisdictions, or 4 years from now we will be in the same fix we are in now, trying to deal with it after it happens. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, the House con\u00ad siders a most topical and critical piece of legislation addressing the scourge of drugs that lays waste to our Nation. This legislation, contained in title IV of this appropriations bill, is Congress' first, but hopefully not last, response to the President's national drug con\u00ad trol strategy, announced on Septem\u00ad ber 5. Let it be clear that this first congres\u00ad sional response to the first national drug control strategy is not about what we should be doing, but about how much more to spend. And spend we will do. This is no paltry, penny\u00ad pinching response. This legislation takes the President's proposed $1.8 billion increase for drugs and $400 million for the crime initiative, and ups it by $1 billion. When combined with the antidrug money in the 13 regular appropria\u00ad tions bills, not all concluded as of yet, our total spending for fiscal year 1990 will fall between $9 and $10 billion. That is compared with $6.6 billion in fiscal 1989, and $1.1 billion a mere 9 years ago at the outset of the Reagan administration in 1981. But let me also say, particularly for Members on my side of the aisle, that we have also won the battle to insure at least a measure of fiscal responsibil-ity. Of the $3.2 billion in this bill, about $1.2 billion will be spent in fiscal 1990, and that $1.2 billion has been offset by reducing spending in the 13 regular appropriations bills by a like amount. So, for this year it is deficit neutral. And future year spending will have to conform to future budget reso\u00ad lutions and targets. We are reprioritiz\u00ad ing Federal spending for the war on drugs, let there be no mistake about it. And I, for one, am proud that the battle on offsets for additional spend\u00ad ing, which has been ongoing through\u00ad out this Congress, has been won on this battlefield. Since we are talking money, and not strategy, let's look at where this addi\u00ad tional spending is taking our drug con\u00ad trol policy. The $3.2 billion in this bill includes $1.9 billion for law enforcement. There is $1 billion for building new Federal prisons, $1 billion. Think of it. There is $300 million additional for State and local law enforcement grants, bringing the appropriation to $470 million, compared with $180 mil\u00ad lion last year. A huge increase. Additional funding for treatment, prevention, and education amounts to $940 million, about $550 million more than requested. It includes: A large in\u00ad crease, $415 million, for the block grant; at least $25 million for treat\u00ad ment for pregnant addicts; $40 million in funding for a new HHS division on improving treatment services; $7 mil\u00ad lion additional for salaries for all of ADAMHA, and $1 million for national youth sports, which I might say is a very good program, for which we get a tremendous bang for our buck. A lot of money is going out very fast for these programs, but I think even these large numbers underestimate the extent of our commitment to this war on drugs. I think that a hard look at the Federal budget would show we spend hundreds of millions, maybe bil\u00ad lions, more. In HHS, the \"official\" drug spending totals include none of the money spent for medical treat\u00ad ment. In the Health Care Financing Administration, it is estimated we spend $277 million under Medicare and Medicaid for antidrug abuse ac\u00ad tivities, not counted. In the Defense Department, as much as $118 million in demand reduc\u00ad tion is not counted for drug screening, testing, and treatment of service mem\u00ad bers. Throughout the Government, some 20 agencies and subagencies have begun drug testing. That is not ac\u00ad counted for. Nor is treatment, employ\u00ad ee assistance plans, health insurance costs. In Justice, we estimate how much is spent on drug prosecution, interdic\u00ad tion, and incarceration. What about all the crimes committed by people on drugs? We need to get a better handle on exactly what we are spending on the war on drugs. And I have put that re\u00ad quirement into this bill. Furthermore, we are spending these funds without having a good idea of what works and what doesn't. We have built an armada of plans, balloons, radar, you name it, to block air ship\u00ad ments, spending billions of dollars with unconfirmed results. In fact, the GAO has recommended that we spend no further money until we figure out what we're getting. Yet there's more money in here. Mr. Skeen and I discovered an entire complex that was being planned and built without consulting Congress. We got on top of that one fast. With all this money going out so fast, there is a great danger of spending inefficiently, if not abusively. Therefore, I sponsored bill language requiring the drug czar to assess each program that we fund, and make a de\u00ad termination of what each of them ac\u00ad complishes. We need to know what we get when we spend a dollar, and where a dollar is best spent. That is my biggest disappointment in the evolution of the debate over this first national drug contol strate\u00ad gy. We haven't debated strategy, we've debated dollars. Not what should we be doing, but how much are we spend\u00ad ing. If spending money will win the war on drugs, then we're doing it. But money alone can't win a war. It takes determination, commitment, participa\u00ad tion, and, yes, strategy. There is a commitment on the part of the leader\u00ad ship to bring out the separate drug au\u00ad thorization legislation. I trust that will occur with speed. Let me finish by saying that I hope, against hope, that this legislation will make a dent in the tragedy of our na\u00ad tional drug problem, which destroys lives, futures, families, innocent chil\u00ad dren, neighborhoods. Say yes to this bill. Say no to drugs. 0 1130 Mr. WHITTEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. ALEXANDER], a membe.r of the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam Speaker, I rise in enthusiastic support of the drug provisions of this conference report. We have been losing our children, control of our streets, schools and workplaces to the drug lords. Simply put, we have been losing the war on drugs. Today, however, we have the chance to bring more ammunition to the front by approving $3.2 billion in funding for antidrug abuse programs. This amount, when added to amounts already provided in fiscal year 1990 appropriations bills, brings 26802 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1~ 1989 the total antidrug funding to $8.8 bil\u00ad lion-$900 million more than request\u00ad ed by President Bush. In order to make a dent in the flood of mind-destroying drugs, we must attack both the supply and demand side of the problem-and attack it with the full force and might of the Nation. As long as there is demand, there will be supply. We only need to re\u00ad member our history-to recall the days of prohibition to prove this case. In order to reduce demand, we must better educate our population to the dangers of drug abuse. For those who insist on continuing to supply this death dealing merchan\u00ad dise, we must have police to appre\u00ad hend them, prosecutors to prosecute them and jails in which they can be thrown to do their time. Let the word go forth to the drug subculture in our country-we in Con\u00ad gress are serious about the war on drugs and you are in our sights. Congress recognizes that in the war on drugs we are dealing with a serious question of national security, address\u00ad ing a plague which threatens our Nation more seriously than any exter\u00ad nal enemy. I also view the funding called for in the report as an investment in the future-the future of our young people. Madam Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. CONTE] that, while there is need for improvement to be made in the Presi\u00ad dent's plan and policies, that on bal\u00ad ance we are making progress. When the President comes forward with a plan, with a national strategy. For the first time we are seeing one in this fight against drugs, and it is certainly necessary to implement that plan with real money to provide additional en\u00ad forcement, additional prosecution, ad\u00ad ditional prisons, additional treatment and additional education. Ms. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of title IV of the conference report on H.R. 3015, the Department of Trans\u00ad portation appropriations for fiscal year 1990. Congress is finally acting to address the most pressing social problem in this country: drugs and drug-related crime. Title IV provides an additional $3.2 billion in funding for anti-drug abuse programs. The funding increase includes an additional $752.8 million for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs within the Department of Health and Human Services. The majority of this new funding goes to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA). With this addition, total ADAMHA anti-drug funding is more than $2 billion. This almost 50 percent increase over 1989 funding will provide States like Rhode Island greater opportunity to implement proven treatment programs, such as in patient rehabilitation services for teenagers as well as adults. The increased ADAMHA funding will help proven institutions like Talbot House in Providence, Caritas House in Pawtucket and Tri-Hab in Woonsocket to expand and improve their services. This bill will also provide for $183.5 million in additional fiscal year 1990 funding for drug abuse prevention and education programs within the Department of Education. $170 mil\u00ad lion of this money will go to the Drug Free Schools program, which has proven to be an etfective program to help States, local educa\u00ad tion agencies, and schools in developing local projects to reduce student drug use. A few weeks ago, I saw firsthand some successful local initiatives such as the Brown University Drug Free Schools and Community Program. I visited the Fox Point Elementary School in Providence, which is a participant in this pro\u00ad gram and was very pleased to see a dedicat\u00ad ed staff working with concerned parents and enthusiastic students. It is clear that the very best way to fight drug use is to stop it before it starts. Title IV also satisfies President Bush's re\u00ad quest for additional funding for law enforce\u00ad ment and the judiciary. H.R. 3015 represents prompt action from the legislative branch in response to Presidential leadership. This bill provides well-balanced funding for treatment, education, and law enforcement. I urge my colleagues to support this timely funding bill. D 1140 Mr. CONTE. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITTEN. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the motion. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mrs. BoxER). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Missis\u00ad sippi [Mr. WHITTEN] to recede and concur the amendment of the Senate numbered 136, with an amendment. The motion was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. AUTHORIZING THE CLERK TO MAKE CORRECTIONS IN EN- GROSSMENT OF HOUSE AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT NO. 136 TO H.R. 3015, DEPARTMENT OF TRANS\u00ad PORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1990 Mr. WHITTEN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the en\u00ad grossment of the House amendment to the Senate amendment numbered 136 to the bill <H.R. 3015) making appro\u00ad priations for the Department of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1990, and for other purposes, the Clerk shall be authorized to make any necessary technical corrections in spelling, punctuation, cross ref erenc\u00ad ing, and section numbering, and to cor\u00ad rect a typographical error in the amendment as printed by changing the amount under the heading SPR Petroleum Account from $145,125,000 to $147,125,000. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? Mr. FRENZEL. Reserving the right to object, Madam Speaker, it is not my intention to ultimately object to the unanimous-consent request. I did want to have a chance to say following the point of order made yesterday that I was well-aware that the bill was going to go to the Rules Committee and come back. I made my point yesterday, so I saw no need to request a vote on the rule, nor a vote on the bill today, because we had one yesterday. The House had a chance to express its will. I do, however, for a moment wish to reiterate some of the statements I made yesterday. The first is that in this appropriation, we have paid for the outlays of the drug war by assess\u00ad ing other accounts a small percentage, I believe .43. That took care of only the outlays and that is part of the reason, about $1.1 billion, why we are over in budget authority over the 302 allocation in this particular bill. So the committee, in my judgment, cheat\u00ad ed on the numbers by taking care of the outlays and not the B.A. The other billion dollars that they are over the 302 occurs by reason of the Highway Aid Account on account of the earthquake. That is a billion dollars. My statement, Madam Speaker, is that these are going to be passed, but at some date the piper has to be paid. My guess is that there will be strong efforts to have to pay the piper in the reconciliation bill, and every place the Appropriations Committee and this House carries us over the 302's and carries us over the bipartisan budget agreement and our own budget resolu\u00ad tion, we are going to have to make it up in another way. I simply want House Members to un\u00ad derstand that. Madam Speaker, I had intended to offer an amendment to H.R. 1465 which would require that all amounts spent from the new oilspill li\u00ad ability trust fund created in this act, be subject to annual appropriations action. This amend\u00ad ment was presented to the Rules Committee and its consideration has not been precluded since the bill was granted an open rule. However, it is my understanding that the chairman of the Merchant Marine Committee will be offering an amendment to H.R. 1465 which provides that amounts spent from the oilspill liability trust fund will be subject to annual appropriations except for emergency removal costs which are capped at $30 mil\u00ad lion. Natural resource damage and civil penal\u00ad ty payments will also be available without fur\u00ad ther appropriations for Federal response and removal actions in this amendment-at a cost of approximately $1 million according to an in\u00ad formal CBO estimate. Since the committees November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26803 with jurisdiction over these matters have de\u00ad cided to limit direct spending to truly emergen\u00ad cy situations where an oilspill has occurred and must be cleaned up, I have decided not to offer my amendment and to support the compromise approach. Although I would prefer to remain true to the budget process and not allow any new direct spending which was not provided in the fiscal year 1990 budget resolution, I recognize the need to have some funds available imme\u00ad diately to the Federal Government if an oilspill occurs. Mr. WHITTEN. Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield to me? Mr. FRENZEL. I yield to the distin\u00ad guished gentleman from Mississippi. Mr. WHITTEN. May I say to my col\u00ad league, Madam Speaker, that I did not oppose his point of order yesterday, but I would call attention to the fact that another point of order, in my judgment, would have applied; that is, our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol put a new appropriation bill into an appropriation bill that had al\u00ad ready passed the House and, in viola\u00ad tion, in my judgment, of the old rule that all appropriation bills originate in the House. In this instance, they added a drug package-appropriations and legislation-to the Transportation appropriations bill which, as I say, in effect, avoids the general rule that money bills originate in the House. So, there was another ground on which a point of order could well have been made, in my judgment. I think the gentleman has rendered a service in making his point of order. Mr FRENZEL. Further reserving the right to object, Madam Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. Often his committee is put in an impossible catch-22 situation by actions of the other body. I think the gentleman and I would both prefer to follow the regular order at all times, and I appreciate the gen\u00ad tleman's contribution. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my res\u00ad ervation of objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPRO\u00ad PRIATIONS ACT, 1990-VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESI\u00ad DENT OF THE UNITED STATES CH. DOC NO. 101-105) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the further con\u00ad sideration of the veto message of the President on the bill <H.R. 3026) making appropriations for the govern\u00ad ment of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for the fiscal year ending Sep\u00ad tember 30, 1990, and for other pur\u00ad poses. Mr. DIXON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the veto mes\u00ad sage of the President together with the accompanying bill <H.R. 3026) be referred to the Committee on Appro\u00ad priations. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. GENERAL LEAVE Mr. DIXON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of the veto of the bill, H.R. 3026. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 3072, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1990 Mr. MURTHA. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill <H.R. 3072) making appropriations for the Depart\u00ad ment of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1990, and for other purposes, with Senate amend\u00ad ments thereto, disagree to the Senate amendments, and agree to the confer\u00ad ence asked by the Senate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Speaker will appoint conferees on his return to the chair. MOTION TO CLOSE CONFER\u00ad ENCE COMMITTEE MEETINGS ON H.R. 3072, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1990 WHEN CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFOR\u00ad MATION IS UNDER CONSIDER\u00ad ATION Mr. MURTHA.

FAIR LABOR STANDARDS AMENDMENTS OF 1989 Mr. WHEAT. Mr. Speaker, by direc\u00ad tion of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 278 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol\u00ad lows: H. RES. 278 Resolved , That at any time after the adop\u00ad tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause l(b) of rule XXIII, de\u00ad clare the House resolved into the Commit\u00ad tee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill <H.R. 2710) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage and for other purposes, 'and the first read\u00ad ing of the bill shall be dispensed with. After general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and which shall not exceed two hours, to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendments now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute, consisting of the text printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five\u00ad minute rule and said substitute shall be con\u00ad sidered as having been read. No amendment to said substitute shall be in order. At the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions, if offered by Repre\u00ad sentative Michel of Illinois, or his designee. D 1210 The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. WHEAT] is recog\u00ad nized for 1 hour. Mr. WHEAT. Mr. Speaker, for pur\u00ad poses of debate only, I yield 30 min\u00ad utes to the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. QUILLEN], pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 278 is a closed rule providing for the con\u00ad sideration of H.R. 2710, a bill amend\u00ad ing the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The resolution provides for 2 hours of debate to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Com\u00ad mittee on Education and Labor. The rule makes in order an amend\u00ad ment in the nature of a substitute printed in the report of the Rules Committee accompanying this resolu\u00ad tion, as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. The substitute shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule and the substitute shall be considered as having been read. Under the rule, no amendments to the substitute are in order. At the conclusion of the consider\u00ad ation of the bill for amendment, the committee shall rise and report the bill with such amendments as may have been adopted to the House. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and any amend\u00ad ments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit, with or without instruc\u00ad tions, by and if offered by Representa\u00ad tive MICHEL of Ii.i.inois. Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the importance of this legislation. It has been 12 years since Congress and the President last approved an increase in the minimum wage. The last adjust\u00ad ment, made 9 years ago, brought the minimum wage to $3.35 an hour. Since that adjustment, the real value of that wage has declined by 30 percent. Earlier this year, the members of this body supported the adoption of H.R. 2 which would have raised the minimum to $4.55 over the next 3 years. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that measure. Since that veto, members of both sides of the aisle have worked assiduously to come up with minimum wage adjustments that all interested parties could agree to. H.R. 2710 is the product of that bi\u00ad partisan effort. It provides for a more modest increase in the minimum wage and establishes a subminimum wage for 16-to 19-year-olds. H.R. 2710 is a measure of vital im\u00ad portance to workers all over this coun\u00ad try, but particularly to the 4 million who labor for the current minimum wage of $3.35 an hour. This bill repre\u00ad sents this body's commitment to an honest day's pay for an honest day of work. I urge that the Members adopt this resolution so that we may proceed to consideration of this measure. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we all share the goal of a fair minimum wage. Finding that fair rate is not always easy. If the rate is set too high, then unemployment is increased because those people whose labor is not worth the minimum wage lose their jobs. If the rate is set too low it does not provide adequate pro\u00ad tection for those least able to bargain for themselves. The issue is further complicated because it costs more to live in some parts of the country than it does in others. The best way to try to solve such a difficult problem is to include repre\u00ad sentatives of the Congress and the ad\u00ad ministration in the negotiating process from the beginning. The majority in Congress passed a minimum wage bill earlier this year, but the President vetoed it because he felt it would in\u00ad crease the unemployment rate by too much, among other reasons. This time the administration has been included in the negotiations. In the Rules Com\u00ad mittee last night, a representative of the administration assured me that the minimum wage bill made in order by this rule is satisfactory to the ad\u00ad ministration. Now Mr. Speaker, I understand that not everyone is happy with the com-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26805 promise, and that is true of any com\u00ad promise. Each one of us does not get everything he or she wants. But on balance, I think this is about the best we can do at this point. In the Rules Committee yesterday, we were told that both organized labor and the ad\u00ad ministration had signed off on this particular package. It requires a deli\u00ad cate balance to achieve that result. Even though I would ordinarily fight for an open rule, in this particu\u00ad lar case I think it is better to give the House an up or down vote on this care\u00ad fully balanced package, because this is one that can be signed into law. Mr. Speaker, with one exception I think the text is satisfactory. There is a difficulty on section 10 of the meas\u00ad ure, and I understand that negotia\u00ad tions are now underway to eliminate section 10 altogether by unanimous consent or at least have a motion to recommit which will achieve that result. I hope it can be worked out before final passage of this measure so that there will be no disagreement. I call the attention of every Member to section 10. Read it; it is not right and should be stricken. I will note that the rule does provide for a motion to recommit with or with\u00ad out instructions, if offered by the gen\u00ad tleman from Illinois CMr. MICHEL]. I am confident any motion he might off er would not jeopardize the chances of this bill becoming law. Mr. Speaker, I support the rule and I hope that the negotiators will solve the difficulty on section 10 without further delay. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York CMr. SOLO\u00ad MON]. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SOLOMON. I yield to the chair\u00ad man of the subcommittee. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I first want to say that the Committee on Education and Labor, and Chairman HAWKINS has worked extremely hard to bring us to this point. We therefore are in support of the rule. However, I would like to make a unanimous-consent request that sec\u00ad tion 10 of the proposed bill, now the substitute for the bill, be totally stricken from the consideration of the measure when we go into the Commit\u00ad tee of the Whole. The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from Pennsylvania CMr. MURPHY] wish the gentleman from Missouri CMr. WHEAT] to yield to him now for the purpose of making a unanimous\u00ad consent request? Mr. MURPHY. Yes, I do, Mr. Speak\u00ad er. The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Missouri CMr. WHEAT] yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MURPHY] for that purpose? Mr. WHEAT. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the chairman of the subcommittee for purposes of proposing a unanimous\u00ad consent request. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my unani\u00ad mous-consent request that section 10 be stricken from the amendment in the nature of a substitute submitted by the Rules Committee for consider\u00ad ation before the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. SOLOMON. I thank the Speak\u00ad er. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member for yielding me this time. Let me say that what just happened here vastly improves this bill so that many of us can support a raise in the minimum wage, which in my opinion is long overdue. I think there is one other area which does concern me and, I think, concerns many Members of Congress who rep\u00ad resent rural districts that have small dairy farms in their districts. D 1220 Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the chair\u00ad man of the subcommittee, the gentle\u00ad man from Pennsylvania [Mr. MURPHY], would engage in a short col\u00ad loquy with me? Mr. MURPHY. If the gentleman will yield, I will be happy to engage in a colloquy. Mr. SOLOMON. The gentleman knows that we, on both sides of the aisle, have some concern about small dairy farms and how they are affected by this legislation. I would like to know whether or not, if the gentleman could explain to me, how 16-to 19- year-old teenagers are affected by this bill, if they work on family dairy farms. Mr. MURPHY. If the gentleman will continue yielding, it is my understand\u00ad ing that a person has to be a full-time farm employee to be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act in the first place, and a person has to have 500 employment hours in any given farm, so it means an equivalent of about 7 employees. That, of course, does not apply to any members of the family who are employed in a farm. They are already exempted from the minimum wage section of the Fair Labor Stand\u00ad ards Act. It is my understanding that the question of the gentleman is whether or not a teenager, 16 to 19, may be paid the subminimum wage under the youth subminimum clause that has been worked out, am I correct? Mr. SOLOMON. Yes, in this legisla\u00ad tion, the gentleman is saying that they would qualify for the subminimum wage, if they meet all the criteria laid out in the legislation? Mr. MURPHY. If the gentleman will continue yielding, so long as they are not a migrant worker, and so long as they are not a seasonable worker under the seasonable and migrant workers' law. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me just say further, then, under the exist\u00ad ing law, and it does not seem to spell it out in this legislation, there is present\u00ad ly an exemption for agricultural em\u00ad ployees 16 years of age and under who work on hand harvest labors alongside their parents on the same farm, and would receive the same piece rate as other employees over the age of 16 on that same farm, your legislation does not change that? Mr. MURPHY. If the gentleman will continue yielding, that section is not affected, no. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I would say that we still have somewhat of a problem as far as the seasonable worker is concerned. I think legislative intent is spelled out here so that the American farm boy is protected. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GEKAS]. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, the last time around I voted in favor of the in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage according to the proposal advanced by President Bush. It was one that was noninfla\u00ad tionary, one that would cost a mini\u00ad mum of new jobs because a minimum wage rise always costs jobs, and it would have, in balance, been appropri\u00ad ate for the time. It still is. Under the framing of this particular rule, we will never have a chance to vote on that same proposal for the in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage as pro\u00ad posed by President Bush originally. What we now have before Members is a closed rule that prohibits any debate except on the compromise reached by these very same individuals and enti\u00ad ties that were in opposite extremes the last time we voted on this. I want to vote for the increase of minimum wage as originally outlined over a 3-year period. It is the best way to mix in with the present economy and to cause the least possible infla\u00ad tionary impact on this present econo\u00ad my. The other part that bothers me is notwithstanding the colloquy that was just now conducted between the gen\u00ad tleman from New York and the gentle\u00ad man from Pennsylvania, the word \"seasonal\" as now in the language means to me that that 16-to 20-year\u00ad old youngster who can be hired by a farmer cannot be hired under the training wage. 26806 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 Now, notwithstanding the legal in\u00ad tents that the gentleman from Penn\u00ad sylvania has tried to outline here, a clear reading of the language makes that individual, 16 to 19, hireable only at the minimum wage. I think that that is such an important facet of this debate that we need to def eat the rule, vote against the previous question on this rule, so that we can clear up that language. We will not have another opportunity to do so if we allow this rule to stand. The farm community is in dire straits if this passes, and our economy as now constituted will suffer a blow, which will make Members all reconsid\u00ad er an action that they contemplated today. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illi\u00ad nois [Mr. PORTER]. Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, it is good to get differences resolved. It is good to get the business of the House completed. This legislation, of course, contains an increase in the minimum wage, and that whole concept where some people get more money, more dollars, but others get a pink slip in order to pay for it, which is really government-cre\u00ad ated unemployment, is a concept that has been, from the very beginning, bankrupt. While it niay make good politics, it makes for bad economics. On the other hand, the bill contains a provision for a teenage training wage, and perhaps to get this provi\u00ad sion adopted, it may be worth support\u00ad ing the entire legislation. Many teen\u00ad agers in America drop out of school, they go on welfare. They never have, Mr. Speaker, a work experience of any type. They\u00b7 never learn to earn their way in our economy. Some advance, in the face of organized labor's opposi\u00ad tion to it, would come through having the teenage training wage that the legislation contains. The young people of this country need the work experience, they need the job training that this would pro\u00ad vide, and this legislation would give something to them even in the face of hostility by organized labor to this provision. Having the provision in the bill, is in my judgment, enough to secure my support for it. I will support the legis\u00ad lation, but only because it contains a very good provision on a teenage train\u00ad ing wage. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHEAT. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has no further requests for time, I think I should point out at this time that the compromise that has been reached that we will consider today is a compromise not only of both sides of the aisle in this body, it is a compromise with the other body, and it is also a compromise that I un-derstand has been reached with repre\u00ad sentatives of the executive branch; that, in fact, the President now sup\u00ad ports the compromise bill that we are going to consider. The rule that we are considering at this time allows for fair and expedi\u00ad tious consideration of the bill that all sides have now agreed to, with thor\u00ad ough debate and time for examination of all the issues. It is not a perfect bill in the sense that any one side won all of the points that we wanted to win in putting together this bill. However , it should be remembered, Mr. Speaker, that the real winners will be the 4 mil\u00ad lion people who now work for mini\u00ad mum wage at $3.35 an hour, who will receive a modest increase over the next 2 years if the bill passes. Mr. Speaker, I have no further re\u00ad quests for time, I yield back the bal\u00ad ance of my time, and I move the previ\u00ad ous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mr. MURTHA). Pursuant to House Resolu\u00ad tion 278 and rule XXIII, the Chair de\u00ad clares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2710. 0 1229 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair designates the gentleman from Washington [Mr. SWIFT] as chairman of the Committee of the Whole and requests the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. TRAXLER] to assume the chair temporarily. IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 2710) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage, and for other pur\u00ad poses, with Mr. TRAXLER <Chairman pro tempore) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore . Pur\u00ad suant to the rule, the bill is considered as having been read the first time. Under the rule, the gentleman from California [Mr. HAWKINS] will be rec\u00ad ognized for 1 hour, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GOODLING] will be recognized for 1 hour. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California [Mr. HAWKINS]. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MURPHY], the chairman of the subcommittee, who has done a magnificent job of keeping the issue of a minimum wage alive and bringing it to this point. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Chairman, first I want to thank my chairman, the gen\u00ad tleman from California [Mr. HAW-KINS] for his tenacity in keeping the minimum wage issue alive, and par\u00ad ticularly for his willingness to compro\u00ad mise some items that a year or two ago seemed as though there was no com\u00ad promise in sight. For that I think all Members owe a great debt to the gen\u00ad tleman for being willing to be big enough to back off some of the posi\u00ad tions that he felt so strongly about that brought us to this point. Mr. Chairman, may I also commend the Speaker of the House, Mr. FOLEY, and the people on the White House staff who met last Friday and again on Monday of this week, that brought us to this point today where instead of controversy on something that is so important to the lower income Ameri\u00ad can workers, that it has brought us to the point where I am sure we will pass this measure today and it will be sent to the White House before Thanksg'iv\u00ad ing. Mr. Chairman, it has been 9 years, 1981, since the last increase in the minimum wage to the poor working class of our country. We talk about them as the working poor, because when you are working for $3.35 an hour, you are among the working poor. It is to those people that we must address our attention. During those 9 years there has been no in\u00ad crease. The measure that was put together in the last few days by our committee, by the White House, by the House leadership will provide that as of April 1 next year, the rate will go from $3.35 an hour to $3.80 per hour, a 45-cent\u00ad per-hour increase. It will provide that 1 year hence, April 1991, it will go from $3.80 to $4.25 per hour, only a 2-step increase, 45 cents, in those 2 years. Basically what we can say to the workers that we have been struggling to meet the needs of is that it will be a period of 17 months from today that we will have that two-step increase. So we consider that a victory, and we thank the President for his willingness to sign that two-step increase in the span of 17 months. What we had to relinquish was that there will be a subminimum training wage paid, but only to teenagers . Those persons under the age of 20 who are first entering the work field may be paid at 85 percent of the minmum wage. We have already established that in the law part-time workers who are full-time students can now be paid 85 percent of the minumum wage. So we are carrying that one step over into the first time employed who are teen\u00ad agers, to encourage teenage employ\u00ad ment. We go one step farther to please the requests of the White House in that we allow an additional 3 months train\u00ad ing for teenagers , persons under 20 for November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26807 an additional 3 months, providing they are in an actual training program, a program that is set up by an employer to train those young people who have had no schooling beyond where they dropped out either in junior high or in high school. This will not apply to any worker over the age of 20. To answer those Members, and I in\u00ad clude myself, who are concerned with small farms, I would like to say, and I know that the gentleman from Penn\u00ad sylvania knows this as well, if not better than I, small farms are exempt. If you have fewer than seven full-time employees you are not covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Some say they should be, but they are not. So no matter what they pay, wheth\u00ad er to a student or to an adult on a small farm, they are not covered under the minimum wage law. They may pay them what the going rate will demand. If they are a member of the family of that farm, they are exempt from the minimum wage law and may be paid at whatever rate they can negoti\u00ad ate with the farmer. If you have more than seven full\u00ad time employees on a farm and you are therefore covered under the minimum wage law, the training wage may be paid to any new hire, first hire, for the period of 3 months, and a program is put into place for an additional 3 months, as, say, an equipment opera\u00ad tor, a hay baler, whatever he may want to do. However, this does not apply as the gentleman well knows, to seasonal and migrant workers. It does apply if you are on a regular farm basis employ\u00ad ment for the teenager entering his first employment. All in all, we believe that by striking section 10, which was rather contro\u00ad versial and was not recognized as that until about 24 hours ago, by striking that section, by meeting the needs of the White House for a training wage for the youth, by meeting our request for a raise in 17 months of 90 cents an hour, we have met what we believe are the concerns of all sides, at least for the time being. I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support this very important measure for America's working poor. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. PETRI]. Mr. PETRI. Mr. Chairman, a year and a half ago I offered in subcommit\u00ad tee and full committee a compromise approach to the minimum wage issue. That compromise approach combined a large increase in the earned income tax credit [EITC] with a modest in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage. That kind of compromise was stoutly resist\u00ad ed all through last year. However, 4 weeks ago, under the leadership of DAN ROSTENKOWSKI and TOM DOWNEY' this House passed the first part of that compromise-a substantial EITC increase adjusted for family size. Today we will pass the second part\u00ad an increase in the minimum wage. The EITC increase that we've actu\u00ad ally passed is somewhat smaller than I originally proposed, and the minimum wage increase that we will pass today is somewhat larger. But we're moving in the right direction. And our combi\u00ad nation of EITC and minimum wage, if enacted into law, will provide more help to working poor people who need help than any minimum wage bill alone. Under our combination approach, by 1991 a low skilled worker with three children capable of earning only the minimum wage, will receive a wage of $4.25 per hour plus EITC equivalent to an additional $1.19 per hour, for a total of $5.44 per hour. A worker with two children will receive a combina\u00ad tion worth $5.28 per hour. In my own State of Wisconsin, which adopted a State EITC just last summer, those two workers will receive extra State EITC amounts that will bring their total effective wages to $6.34 per hour and $5.58 per hour, respectively. Now of course market forces are per\u00ad fectly capable of raising wages, includ\u00ad ing entry level wages, as the productiv\u00ad ity of our economy increases. That is happening today, to the extent that right now there are almost no non\u00ad tipped family heads earning as little as the current minimum wage. And by 1991, as these forces continue to oper\u00ad ate there will probably be few non\u00ad tipped families heads earning as little as the new minimum wage. That is, the minimum wage increase will be ir\u00ad relevant to them. But the EITC increase that we have passed will not be irrelevant to them. It helps family heads all the way up to the income scale to $10.50 per hour. In fact, the EITC part of the combina\u00ad tion approach we are passing is the far more powerful tool for really helping the working poor. Unlike a minimum wage, it has no bad economic side ef\u00ad fects in the form of inflation and lost jobs. And it is extremely efficient. It is targeted precisely and only to those who need help, and in proportion to their level of need. So, Mr. Chairman, I hope that the kind of debate we have had on this issue over the past 2 years is the last of its kind. I hope that the next time we talk about how to help the working poor we focus from the beginning on how best really to achieve the objec\u00ad tive, and use the modern and efficient tool-the EITC. Next time let's put to rest the time-honored and well-mean\u00ad ing, but crude and counterproductive attempts to help people by fixing prices in an otherwise competitive market. All over the world, even in Russia, China, and Eastern Europe, politicians are discovering that that kind of approach simply does not work. It's goals may be wonderful, but it just doesn't work. Therefore as we look beyond today's actions, as we look to the future, let us take the advice of the chief economic policy advisor to the Dukakis-Bentsen Presidential campaign, Robert J. Sha\u00ad piro. He said: Over ther increased . . . in order to finally lift the families of all full time workers out of pov\u00ad erty. At that point, the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history. So, with due deference to hoary po\u00ad litical tradition, let us go ahead today and pass this half of the compromise approach to helping the working poor. But as we do so, let's recognize that while we all agree on the goal, we are using yesterday's discredited tool. Let's move beyond this futile exercise in the future. 0 1240 Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. HAYES]. Mr. HAYES of Illinois. Mr. Chair\u00ad man, I rise today to again express my support for an increase in the mini\u00ad mum wage. I rise today on behalf of the American worker-the hard-work\u00ad ing, low-wage earners across America. Since the beginning of the lOlst Congress, and before, strong efforts have been put forth to bring about a viable minimum wage increase bill-an attempt to give the working poor their first pay raise in more than 8 years. Our efforts have been undermined each time by the Reagan and Bush ad\u00ad ministrations, standing as the only ob\u00ad stacle to a minimum wage increase. I understand that the President, in keeping with his \"kinder and gentler\" message, today offers a compromise measure which raises the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over the next 2 years which allows employers to pay new teenage workers just 85 percent of the minimum wage for the first 3 months of employment. While I certainly feel compelled to support this compromise measure so that our Nation's workers can finally receive an increase in their pay, I would however be less than honest if I did not express my dismay and con\u00ad cern about the alleged training wage provisions in the bill. I have some very real concerns about the precedent that will be set because of the subminimum training wage. We have come a long way over the last 50 years in terms of fair wages for our Nation's work force, and I am fearful that we will be taking a giant step backward when we adopt provisions which will pay a new sub\u00ad minimum wage. So, while I support the bill before us, H.R. 2710 and the compromise agreement, it disturbs me in that these measures do not go far enough. We should be providing even more of an 26808 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 increase in mm1mum wage, and we should not implement a so-called training wage which merely short\u00ad changes workers. An increase of 90 cents an hour still leaves minimum wage earners with a purchasing power that does not bring their families out of poverty. It will still be impossible for them to give their children a decent quality of life. However, we have waited too long to address the needs of working men and women and that is why today I must support these measures. In closing I would like to commend my chairmen, Gus HAWKINS and AUSTIN MURPHY, for their continued perseverance concerning a minimum wage increase. I know that sincere ef\u00ad forts have been made to work with the Bush administration to bring about a workable minimum wage bill. I encourage my colleagues to sup\u00ad port this modest, but very much needed minimum wage increase. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. GUNDERSON]. Mr. GUNDERSON. Mr. Chairman, I want the RECORD to show that I almost missed my chance to speak be\u00ad cause I was consulting with the Demo\u00ad cratic staff, for whatever that is worth. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GUNDERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I have been working for 15 years to get this corrected. It is a Democrat staff, a Democrat Party; a Republican Party, not a Republicanic Party. Get it right. It is a Democrat Party, a Democrat staff. M-:.-. GUNDERSON. Mr. Chairman, I want the RECORD to show I stand cor\u00ad rected. Mr. Chairman and Members, when\u00ad ever we deal with a compromise, we come to a situation where no one is happy, and anyone who will talk to the players in the minimum wage debate will find it quickly evident that no one is happy with the compromise that is here today. Many on the other side of the aisle have objected strenu\u00ad ously for the last 8 to 9 years during the decade of the eighties to any kind of a training wage, and it is fair to say that Members on my side of the aisle are not very happy with the dynamics of the training wage that is before us today. Yet, Mr. Chairman, I have said for some time that we can agree on the concept of the numbers involved in this minimum wage dispute, and we have done that. We made an April im\u00ad plementation rather than a January 1, and we have worked it out over a 2- year, rather than a 3-year, period, as many on my side, myself included, sug\u00ad gested. The real debate over the last year has focused on whether we would or would not include an opportunity for training wages for those people who otherwise, because they are at the margins, would not get a job. It is my conclusion that, albeit not a good com\u00ad promise, this is the best chance we have to try the concept of a training wage. D 1250 The reality is that 85 percent of the people at the minimum wage in today's society are covered by the lan\u00ad guage which says, \"Up to age 20.\" I have pointed out so often in discus\u00ad sions throughout my district that let us understand the minimum wage in 1989 is not typically talking about the head of a family. It is talking about that single part-time student who hap\u00ad pens to be working part time in addi\u00ad tion to their studies. We are not talk\u00ad ing of the head of a household; and yet as I think as I talk to my col\u00ad leagues on the Republican side of the aisle and as I talk to those small busi\u00ad ness people who are concerned about whether we should or should not make any kind of an increase in the mini\u00ad mum wage, the reality is that when you have the full implementation of the bill in front of us, $4.25 times 40 hours a week, you get a weekly pay of $170. Multiply that times 52 weeks a year, and this person will have a gross pay of $8,840. Today the poverty line for a family of four in America society is $12,100. We do not solve that problem yet today, but we make a step in the right direction on the minimum wage. We make a real commitment to see wheth\u00ad er a youth opportunity is or is not a good concept. So albeit none of us are happy about it, this is an effort worth trying. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GAYDOS], a member of the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. GAYDOS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MURPHY], my colleague from the adjacent congres\u00ad sional district, for the work he and his committee on both sides of the aisle have put into this very essential legis\u00ad lation. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2710, The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989. President Calvin Coolidge, one of our most conservative Presidents, once said, \"Work is honorable; it is entitled to an honorable recompense.\" Unfortunately, some do not agree and, as a result, the American worker working at the minimum wage in 1989 is not being compensated fairly or honorably for his or her efforts. This was not always the case. During the 1960's and 1970's, a person who worked full time at a minimum wage job could earn slightly more than the amount required to keep a family of three out of poverty. Today, however, the earnings of that same full-time minimum wage worker is more than 29 percent below the pov\u00ad erty line for a three-person family-a mere $134 per week, a net income of $6,968 a year. The only type of family that minimum wage barely keeps out of poverty is a single individual living alone. Even two people living on a minimum wage salary would be at 10 percent below the estimated poverty level for 1988. Most minimum wage workers do not support only themselves. Almost half are 25 years or older, and one in four is the head of a household. It has been more than 8 years-in 1981-since we last raised the mini\u00ad mum wage, to $3.35 per hour. Since then, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has decreased by 36 percent. Everyone knows that $3.35 today buys a whole lot less than it did 8 years ago. It buys about $2.40 in 1981 dollars of groceries, medicine, or hous\u00ad ing. Mr. Chairman, we have been fiddling around with this issue for too long. We waited 12 years to introduce and pass legislation. We passed H.R. 2 back in March of this year, and President Bush vetoed it. In May, this body came back with a compromise-the conference report-and met the Presi\u00ad dent part way. That too, unfortunate\u00ad ly, was vetoed by Mr. Bush's kinder and gentler pen. H.R. 2710 is as far as this body can afford to budge. This bill would in\u00ad crease the minimum wage from the current $3.35 per hour by a mere 45 cents to $3.80 on April 1, 1990. An\u00ad other modest increase of 45 cents on April 1, 1991, would increase the mini\u00ad mum hourly wage to $4.25. With this legislation, I believe that we have met the President more than halfway. We have caved in to his demand for a subminimum training wage. H.R. 2710 provides for such a wage for all first-time teenage employ\u00ad ees whose total work experience equals 90 days or less until 1993. We have also expanded the current small business exemption to include even more American businesses and work\u00ad ers. So, this will have to be our best, a pitiful best because we are still going to hurt too many people at the bottom of the earnings ladder. Even with the passage of H.R. 2710, we are not really being fair to those 8 million Americans who work at the minimum wage. Had we kept the minimum wage at pace with inflation since the 1981 in\u00ad crease, it would be a whopping $4.68 per hour. We cannot guess when mini-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26809 mum wage workers will be seeing that kind of money, because in 1992, even if this legislation is passed and signed, they still will be making only $4.25 per hour. So for now, those workers will have to be satisfied with earning less than enough to get them above the poverty level. They will have to forget about honorable compensation. They will have to be content with surviving from paycheck to paycheck. This is a bitter pill to swallow, Mr. Chairman, but I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. RIDGE]. Mr. RIDGE. Mr. Chairman, many people deserve very special recognition today, and at the risk of offending those who I do not identify, I would like to point out the particular contri\u00ad bution of the chairman and the vice chairman of this committee. The gentleman from California [Mr. HAWKINS] and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GOODLING] have helped keep our focus on the ultimate resolution of a very difficult political issue. The gentleman from California [Mr. HAWKINS] and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GOODLING] have reminded us that if we are truly interested in reaching out and affect\u00ad ing in a positive way the lives of the 3 or 4 million people who live and work on the minimum wage, that some\u00ad where along the line we are going to have to put the political posturing aside and work toward a final solution, even if it means compromising things that for a long time and very good rea\u00ad sons individual members may have held dear to themselves. So I con\u00ad gratulate them for keeping the Cham\u00ad ber and our colleagues' eyes on the target to do something in a significant way with the minimum wage. Mr. Chairman, today we have the opportunity to do the right thing. We could have let politics override our effort to reach an agreement on the minimum wage. I am sure that there are colleagues among us on both sides of the aisle who would have preferred no compromise. I am sure there are some who thought they could have used the failure to reach a compro\u00ad mise, to reach an accommodation, to their political advantage. Fortunately, once the political rhet\u00ad oric and the charges and accusations and proposals and counterproposals were put aside, both sides decided to do something real about increasing the minimum wage, to submerge those political differences, and to work toward a common goal. We have cer\u00ad tainly done that. Mr. Chairman, I know there is some resistance on both sides of the aisle in supporting this particular measure. I know some of my colleagues on the Democratic side find particular fault with it because the increase is not great enough. The $4.25 does not keep pace with inflation. The $4.25 is not a figure they think is appropriate. They think that the minimum wage should be raised substantially more than the compromise provides. To my friends who feel strongly and use that as an excuse to vote no, I would remind them that in spite of their good intentions, their wish, hope or preference for a higher minimum wage will not buy another loaf of bread, will not buy another pat\u00b7 of shoes. The fact of the matter is that $4.25 is an increase, a modest increase and one that these people need and de\u00ad serve. I would encourage them to sub\u00ad limate that feeling that the House should have done more. I implore them not to go back home and say, \"Well, I wanted to give you $4.50 or I wanted to give you $5, or I wanted to give you $5.25.\" That is simply not the package we have before us. We are not going to see this issue again in the near future. If those who pref er a higher minimum wage are interested in doing something to help these people, then $4.25 is it. Remember, the people you seek to help cannot buy more bread or put another pair of shoes on their young ones with your good intentions. To my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, I know that many of them just do not want to raise the minimum wage ever. My remarks di\u00ad rected to them will not be terribly meaningful. There may be some of my colleagues who are still somewhat un\u00ad decided, and I would like to share a couple of thoughts with you. We can all remember when we were very much involved in the campaign when George Bush said he was going to raise the minimum wage. Earlier this year he said he would raise it to $4.25. Today we have an opportunity to help our President deliver on that campaign promise. He made the prom\u00ad ise and we want to give him the oppor\u00ad tunity to deliver on that promise, and I think it is incumbent upon Republi\u00ad cans to do so. As I said before, I think there are probably some of my colleagues who just could not vote for a minimum wage increase regardless of the level, but to them I would say that I pref er George Bush's kinder-and-gentler world. This is the level our President said he could support, and I think it is incumbent upon us to support him. I think what we see, Mr. Chairman, is the welcome conclusion of the politi\u00ad cal debate over dollars, over submini\u00ad mum wages, over commissions; that political debate is behind us. We have resolved those issues. That debate is over. What I think we need to do today as Republicans and Democrats is make a statement, not about dollars and cents and subminimums, but a statement to those men and women who work on minimum wage or supplement their meager incomes on minimum wage, that Republicans and Democrats alike unite on this issue. D 1300 Republicans and Democrats today must make a joint statement that we, as their elected Representatives, ap\u00ad preciate the contribution that these men and women are making to our country. They are working. They are working very hard in many instances, and once we peel away the political debate, what Republicans and Demo\u00ad crats should join together today in saying is that there is considerable value in their work. We must be cer\u00ad tain that these men and women under\u00ad stand that it is important to us as a country that they do work, that we ap\u00ad preciate their contribution to this economy and to this country by work\u00ad ing at the minimum wage, that there is true value in their work no matter what they do and in the absence of any increase over the past 8 years, we, as Republicans and Democrats, say, \"Thank you,\" and raise that minimum wage. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage both sides of the aisle to support it. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. PERKINS], a member of the committee. Mr. PERKINS. Mr. Chairman, dis\u00ad tinguished colleagues, it is with diffi\u00ad culty that I stand before the Members today addressing a topic in a fashion that I wish I did not have to, and cer\u00ad tainly in a fashion that I am sure a number of others feel similar feelings toward. It is a real problem, the bill we have before us today. It is anathema to me not to be able to vote for a minimum wage increase. The pain, the suffering that people across this country have gone through in the last 8 years without having any value added to what their work prod\u00ad uct was, indeed, more than they should have undertaken in this coun\u00ad try during that time period, but I want to say, despite the fact that we are get\u00ad ting an increase, and it is desperately needed, of any sort for the working people of this country with this legis\u00ad lation, let there be no doubt about it that what we are doing here today is the creation of a two-tier system whereby workers can be employed in a fashion at wages that undercut any in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage for the workers of this country. What we are doing here today is putting in place a system that bodes ill for the future of the American workers and the Ameri\u00ad can workplace. What we are doing here today, let there be no doubt about it from those who support the 26810 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 laborers and the workers of this coun\u00ad try, is a travesty for the future that we have here in America. There is no way that I, as an individ\u00ad ual, despite what my leadership may say, despite what the labor movement may say, can in conscience support the legislation that we have in front of us today. Indeed, what we are talking about from my perspective can be de\u00ad scribed in no less terms than a sellout to the President of the United States, who has, indeed, gotten his victory. There is no victory for the American working people by this legislation. Let there be no doubt that this is a def eat. They are suffering. Mr. Chairman, my friends, my col\u00ad leagues, this, I know, was done with good intentions, but what we have before us today is not going to solve the problem in the short term and much more so in the long term. We are presenting a system that is going to create problems for the American worker as long as the labor laws of this country are in place, because we are seeing the door open; the cracks in the labor field are showing to all who are looking there. I think this is wrong. I would ask that people consider closely their vote on this legislation, because what we are talking about today is a step backward for the Amer\u00ad ican worker and for all those who be\u00ad lieve that work should be rewarded in America. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. COLEMAN], a distin\u00ad guished member of the committee. Mr. COLEMAN of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, the debate here today seems that the compromise that we are going to be voting on shortly satis\u00ad fies few people that are purists. We have to recognize that we, as members of the legislative branch, are involved with the art of the possible, and this compromise that is before us, I think, is a true compromise, where there are many winners and, frankly, not as many losers as might be brought forth here in the speechify\u00ad ing, a compromise in the sense of the number of years it takes to phase in the increase, a compromise over the training wage, and I want to point out that the training wage is very impor\u00ad tant to employers who are being asked to increase their minimum wage pay\u00ad ments to people in many cases who do not have experience or the training to fulfill a position. This gives them an incentive to hire these, especially young people and sometimes older people, in order to provide a minimum wage for them. I think that in many parts of the country, frankly, the increases in the minimum wage are a moot point. There are signs all over every fast-food franchise and many businesses of help wanted. Young people are being hired at $5 and $6 an hour in many cases, not in all parts of the country, and I think this bill will help establish those other parts of the country to provide that opportunity. I see this as not the best bill, but I see it as a true compro\u00ad mise. I think it deserves the support here of our House. It keeps the President's promise. I want to remind my colleagues on this side of the aisle that the President has agreed to this compromise. He cam\u00ad paigned on increasing the minimum wage. I believe he has gotten a fairly good bill, and we ought to provide sup\u00ad port in a bipartisan fashion for this compromise. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Montana [Mr. WILLIAMS]. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, there are not very many people who are embracing this piece of legislation, certainly not mini\u00ad mum wage workers who have now waited longer for an increase in the minimum wage than any other mini\u00ad mum wage workers in the history of the United States, certainly not the Republicans in the White House who really would rather have had much more compromise than is in this bill. Mr. Chairman, this bill is not being embraced by a majority of Democrats, including myself, although I will be among the majority who vote for it. We believe that the compromises are far too great, and that we really are not doing enough for workers who labor at the minimum wage. The re\u00ad sults of this bill certainly are not going to be embraced by America's 17-, 18-, and 19-year-old workers. These are not kids, these 18-and 19-year-olds. They are young adults. They are trying to get together enough money to make that new marriage of theirs work or they are trying to earn enough money to meet the extraordinarily rapid rise in the cost of tuition and books and board and room at America's colleges. They are not going to be happy with this bill, because we are putting them, for the first time in American history, on a subminimum wage. They are going to make less than their counter\u00ad parts who are 20, 21, 22 years old. Mr. Chairman, there are not very many smiles about this legislation today. But a fellow out my way in Montana once wrote a book. The title of the book was, \"I May Not Be Much, Baby, But I'm All I Got.\" So I guess that is where we are with this legisla\u00ad tion today. Let me share with the Members a couple of problems I have with this bill, but because it is all we got, I am going to vote for it: When Jerry Ford was in office, the minimum wage was $2.30 an hour. Since former President Ford left off ice, inflation has gone up 110 percent. That means that the min-imum wage today ought to be $4.85 an hour if it just kept up with inflation, which means no increase, just kept up with inflation. This bill is $1.50 below that. It does not even keep up with in\u00ad flation. The standard for minimum wage in this country has always been that it should be set at about one-half the av\u00ad erage salary in America, that is, the salary for people who work but are not managers, are not supervisors. It should be half of that average annual salary in the United States. In the 1950's and the 1960's, it was half, and more, than the average annual wage. D 1310 In the late 1970's it fell to about 44 percent of the average annual wage, and today it is less than 35 percent of the average annual wage. It would have to be not $4.25 2 years from now, as this bill ~ccomplishes. Rather the minimum wage would today have to be $4.87 an hour to meet that 50 percent target that has been set. This bill represents a major compro\u00ad mise, too great for some of us, on the wage, and too great a compromise on a two-tiered system, the subminimum. We are now going to say to young people in this country they are in a different class and they have to work at a subminimum wage for perhaps as long as 120 days. Breaking that down into summer employment, Members can see that for 2 or 3 years these young people are going to be required to work at less than the minimum wage. No, no one is embracing this legisla\u00ad tion. There are no smiles about this bill. Probably nothing in this decade has more symbolized the stagnant nature of the ability of the White House and the Congress to work together to pass dramatic, meaningful legislation for working, low-income Americans than this bill. For some reason, I suppose due in part to a divided government, a Republican White House, a Democrat\u00ad ically controlled Congress, those two branches are simply not pulling the oars together and setting sail in a dra\u00ad matic way to make a real difference in the lives of low-income workers. This bill will help some, but not much. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. RoUKEMA], who has worked hard on this issue for a long time. Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Chairman, in my view the biggest policy question we have faced in the debate over the in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage has not been the wage rate itself, but the du\u00ad ration and scope of a training wage. I for one am happy to endorse this com\u00ad promise-finally we are getting beyond November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26811 nickel and diming the level of the hourly wage and directs our attention to a policy breakthrough; namely, the training wage. The compromise we are presented with today represents the acknowledgment of two fundamental precepts I have consistently advocat\u00ad ed: that a training wage is sound public policy and that in order to be effective, such a training wage must not unfairly penalize those who work at the minimum wage. My training wage proposal, the basics of which are incorporated in this compromise, takes into account the fact that we are facing critical shortages in skilled labor that can be met, in part, by providing new en\u00ad trants into the work force and inexpe\u00ad rienced workers a chance for genuine on-the-job training. My proposal placed a reasonable limit on the time period during which an employee may be paid a training wage. Simply stated, new entrants into the job market could be paid a training wage for 90 days. If, and only if an employee did not have 90 days experience in an oc\u00ad cupation, an employer could pay the training wage for one additional 90 day period. In no case would any em\u00ad ployee be paid a lower rate for more than 180 days. Contrary to the train\u00ad ing wage provision in the compromise, my proposal did not call for Depart\u00ad ment of Labor certification or paper\u00ad work. Instead, the initiative laid with the employer to inquire as to an em\u00ad ployee's previous work experience in order to pay the additional 90 day training wage for inexperienced em\u00ad ployees. Perhaps most importantly, the employer had to provide on-the\u00ad job training for the period of time the employee is paid the training wage. I believe it is time we on both sides of the aisle exercise some intellectual honesty and admit that an increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. With a fair and workable training wage, we are taking an important op\u00ad portunity to use the Fair Labor Stand\u00ad ards Act not merely as a wage floor, but as a tool to improve the quality and prospects of the American work force. This \"new hire\" provision for teen\u00ad agers is not a complete or even nearly perfect provision but does represent a realistic first step toward creating on\u00ad the-job training at an apprentice wage. Between 1988 and 2000, nearly 43 million workers will enter the labor force. Service-producing industries will account for almost all the 18.1 million growth in jobs. Three service-produc\u00ad ing industries-retail trade, health services, and business services-will ac\u00ad count for half of this growth. Workers with low educational attainment are likely to continue to be at a disadvan\u00ad tage in competing for better paying jobs. For this reason it is essential that we retain the entry level jobs that pro\u00ad vide many workers their first exposure 29-059 0-90-15 (Pt. 19) to the workplace. I need not remind my colleagues that minority and youth unemployment are directly re\u00ad lated to a lack of training and educa\u00ad tional opportunity. It truly stretches the outer boundaries of common sense to argue against a realistic training wage that would mitigate some of the effects of educational disadvantage. We recently appropriated $4 billion for the financing of the Job Training Partnership Act in the coming fiscal year. We included $2 million for the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Train\u00ad ing to begin a series of pilot projects to test the feasibility of applying the ap\u00ad prenticeship concept of training to a disadvantaged and discouraged youth population. While I will not contest that this is money well spent, I would like to remind my colleagues that all over this country, in thousands of small businesses and large, the con\u00ad cept of apprenticeship is being applied to young people who are getting their first jobs, or taking part-time jobs while in school. What I am advocating here is nothing less than what already exists-all I am saying is, a training wage will retain these first job oppor\u00ad tunities while giving employers addi\u00ad tional encouragement to hire and train workers. And it doesn't require Federal revenues-it simply acknowl\u00ad edges and encourages what is already going on in the workplace. And we have a long way to go: The youth unemployment rate this past July was 10. 7 percent. The rate of job\u00ad lessness for black youths for July was 22.8 percent. Now, we can be more cer\u00ad tain that young people will not be cut out of jobs when the minimum wage increases. Indeed, we have saved jobs because of the enactment of a fair and sensible training wage. The current wage rate includes an 85 percent wage for full-time students. This comprise proposal has ample precedent in terms of how we have ap\u00ad proached the training wage issue in the past. Let's face it, there is a limit to how much employers can afford to pay those with only limited job skills and work experience. As a worker's skills and experience increase-so does the value of their labor which trans\u00ad lates into increased compensation. An increase in the basic wage rate alone will not address the problems of pover\u00ad ty and the need for improved educa\u00ad tion and job training. Neither will a training wage. But this is not a prob\u00ad lem that has a single unifying solu\u00ad tion. Instead, we must use all the tools at our disposal to create Federal poli\u00ad cies which assist job growth and reten\u00ad tion, and the training and develop\u00ad ment of our work force. While this compromise will not save as many entry-level jobs as my proposal would have because it limits the training wage to teenagers, I believe that un\u00ad employed young people will ultimately reap the benefit of seeing job opportu-nities increase, and not diminish along with the increase in the basic wage rate. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con\u00ad sume. Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the bipartisan compromise version of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989 (H.R. 2710) to in\u00ad crease the minimum wage to $4.25 in 2 years. I recognize that this measure represents only a partial victory. I hope that the next administration will work with Congress to increase the minimum wage rate to more equitable levels, and that we will never again allow a decade to elapse with no action. This bill does not fully restore the eroded purchasing power of the minimum wage, which would be at least $4.90 in 1990 if adjusted for infla\u00ad tion. However, this bill deserves our vote not only because it provides a long overdue increase to low-wage workers and accommodates the con\u00ad cerns of business and the administra\u00ad tion, but also because it will benefit the economy and enhance our nation's competitiveness. This minimum wage increase is good for the economy because it provides consumers with increased earning and purchasing power. These workers will be able to buy more goods, and those extra dollars will flow back into our economy. An adequate minimum wage is good for the economy because it serves as the wage stabilizer in our Na\u00ad tion's free market system. Except for the wage floor established by the Fed\u00ad eral minimum wage law, all other wage rates in our national economy are set by the free market system. The minimum wage serves as an anchor to steady wage levels in this free market system with its inevitable periods of economic downturns and upswings. Also, you should support H.R. 2710 in order to increase our international competitiveness. By not allowing the minimum wage rate to even partially keep pace with inflation, this Nation has been subsidizing the low-wage em\u00ad ployers and inefficient businesses by encouraging these firms to remain competitive solely at the expense of their employees. Businesses can save money through depressed labor costs and have less incentive to improve their management, products, or serv\u00ad ices in order to better compete in the world economy. It is the responsibility of businesses to pay decent wages for work performed by their employees\u00ad not the responsibility of Government to play an even greater role in \"making up the difference\" between an individuals' earned income and a basic standard of living through in\u00ad creased transfer payments and other programs. This long overdue and mod\u00ad erate increase will not only help work\u00ad ers but will also benefit our economy 26812 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 and our international competitiveness. I urge you to support H.R. 2710. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. SMITH]. D 1320 Mr. SMITH of Vermont. Mr. Chair\u00ad man, I would first like to thank the chairman and the vice chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, on which I have the privilege of serving, for the long and hard work they have done over the life of this legislation in this session of Congress . It has not always been easy or enjoy\u00ad able, but they have persisted and as a result we have today clearly a compro\u00ad mise but still a strong piece of legisla\u00ad tion for the working men and women of the United States of America. It constitutes a victory for working men and women, I believe, for a number of reasons. First, though some would wish it had happened not at all and others would wish it had happened sooner with more money, we can now admit that for 8, 9, 10 years waiting for an increase in the base wage rate of this country has simply been a wait that is too long and too hurtful and too pain\u00ad ful for too many people. I voted for the first increase in the minimum wage to pass this House, and I intend to support this one also. I think beyond an agreement and an increase in the base wage rate of this country this debate has brought two additional and important ideas to the floor of the Congress as legitimate policy items. First is the idea of the refundable earned income tax credit or, as I would call it, a living wage policy for Ameri\u00ad cans who earn less. than $10.50 an hour. The fact of the matter is that first introduced in the minimum wage con\u00ad text, now that living wage proposal has life in the child care proposal that currently rests before the two bodies of this Congress, and I hope that before we go home for Christmas we will also have been able to tie a bow on another Christmas present for Ameri\u00ad can parents and American families and American children, and that is the child care package with the living wage or earned income tax credit in\u00ad volved. Second is the subminimum wage provision: Controversial as it is and as great as my concerns are about poten\u00ad tial abuses, I take some confidence from the statement of Mr. Lane Kirk\u00ad land of the AFL-CIO, who says that he thinks the abuses can be controlled. And I also remember over the last 8 to 10 years the pleas of several big-city mayors in the United States of Amer\u00ad ica who have an employment problem or an employability problem with many teenagers in their cities, simply saying that a subminimum wage, done well, free of abuse could in fact very likely open the doors to opportunity to young men and women which have been closed for too long. For these and for the simple fact that it is high time that we got to $4.25 in the minimum wage, I intend to support this bill. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. TRAFICANT]. Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Chairman, all through the Reagan years we asked the working poor to bite the bullet. It was not just that, they had to later on eat part of that bullet because many times they did not have much else in the house to eat. I think it is a sad day in America when people work 8 hours a day and still qualify for food stamps and hous\u00ad ing vouchers. Today we have working poor families that number about 37 million people with no health insur\u00ad ance. What a crime. Today $3.35 an hour does not even buy the food that was priced in 1955. Now I hear Members all the time really complaining about the cost of living down here in the District of Co\u00ad lumbia, talking about the need for more money or more per diem. How could a family of four buy a home or even rent a place to live, provide decent food and shelter and clothing for their children on that meager wage? What we are doing here today is not the best, but it is the only thing we can do, and it is right for us to do it. By not doing it, we subsidize American industry by allowing full-time workers for certain companies to go out and get taxpayer subsidies. That is foolish. So I want to rise here today and say to Chairman HAWKINS, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. GOODLING, Mrs. ROUKEMA, espe\u00ad cially Chairman HAWKINS: \"You de\u00ad serve an awful lot of credit. You hung in there against a couple of Presidents. You have done the job.\" Hopefully we will not have to over\u00ad ride any vetoes, that Republicans and Democrats alike will do what is right, period, because it is a crime for people to work 8 hours a day and then qualify for food stamps. Think about it. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. FAWELL]. Mr. FAWELL. Mr. Chairman, with all the compromise bills being thrown around to increase the minimum wage, joined today with this so-called bipar\u00ad tisan bill, I think we in Congress seemed to have convinced ourselves that we are giving these raises, spend\u00ad ing our own money. I believe it is worth stating from the outset that whether or not you are for an in\u00ad crease, we are not giving away money from the Federal Government. It is the business payrolls of America that once again will finance this congres\u00ad sional mandate we design today. It does not matter who supports or writes the bill. A rapid increase in the minimum wage will hurt those who need help the most, those seeking entry-level jobs, not the working poor. All economists, the CBO, the De\u00ad partment of Labor, almost all edito\u00ad rialists of our major newspapers, re\u00ad gardless of political bent, agree on two things that are certain to occur with an increase in the minimum wage. You have heard it before, but it bears re\u00ad peating. Guaranteed job loss and increases in inflation. The estimates range from 125,000 lost jobs to 800,000; with a 2- year phase-in we will simply see those job losses sooner that we would with a 3-year phase-in. Of course, there will be, and this is not mentioned very ofter, the ripple effect, boosting union wages and in\u00ad creasing inflation even more. When positions change on the mini\u00ad mum wage legislation, it does not change the people who will be affected by an increase to $4.25. It is not the working poor who are affected, be\u00ad cause we know that relatively few min\u00ad imum wage earners are under the pov\u00ad erty line. When one subtracts the 1 million workers who earn tips that put them considerably over the minimum wage, when one subtracts all of those earn\u00ad ing commissions, when one subtracts 90 percent of minimum wage workers who earn minimum wage because they have chosen to only work part-time, when one subtracts all of those stu\u00ad dents who work at minimum wage jobs who still live at home, one has to ask who is left out of roughly 3 million on minimum wage today? Who are we talking about? The minimum wage increase is sup\u00ad posed to help the working poor. Mr. Chairman, why is it then that Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands all resist a mandated in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage or at least advocate restrictions so that the increases will not have the full effect upon the island economies? The argu\u00ad ment is that their economies are too poor to support such a wage increase. Is that not the same thing as saying that this minimum wage increase will hurt the poor? Mr. Chairman, this compromise, which was written over\u00ad night, contains a minimum wage that is supposed to mitigate the job losses. I do not know of anybody here, and anybody who has read this bill raises their hand. I do not think anyone has. It is one of those bills that has been put on us all of a sudden. We have a subminimum wage that is supposed to mitigate job losses faced by young workers who need those first job experiences. However, the training wage, for all practical purposes, is only November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26813 3 months in length. It is a lifetime limit of only 6 months. If anybody wants to get through all the bureau\u00ad cratic jungle to get to the next 3 months, that is. It vanishes completely, it is gone in 3 years. An unskilled worker who hap\u00ad pens to be over 20 years old would not get the same opportunity to gain expe\u00ad rience while receiving a training wage. In addition, the criteria in the bill that must be met in order to pay their training wage are once again compli\u00ad cated, bureaucratic, and as unworkable as the current subminimum wage al\u00ad ready in place, seldom used by employ\u00ad ers. 0 1330 Mr. Chairman, let Members not fool ourselves that the face of this legisla\u00ad tion will change the bottom line. Hun\u00ad dreds of thousands of jobs lost, infla\u00ad tion, and not helping the people who need the help the most. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair \u00b7an\u00ad nounces that the gentleman from Cali\u00ad fornia [Mr. HAWKINS] has 33 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GOODLING] has 33% minutes remaining. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. KENNELLY]. Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2710. The bill is not as strong as I would like, but I am pleased that we have arrived at a compromise which will provide at least some relief to the working poor in this Nation. Ours is a country which believes in the work ethic. We have said that \"he who does not work shall not eat.\" There is some justice in that, but the flip side of the old adage should be true as well. \"He-or she-who does work must be assured of a decent standard of living.\" We are told that very few of those who work at minimum wage are from poor families. Opponents of an in\u00ad crease would paint a picture of teen\u00ad agers working after school to earn money for superfluous items like stereos and clothes. In reality that is a very small part of the picture. When it gets right down to it, the minimum wage is an issue of equity between men and women. Sev\u00ad enty percent of minimum wage work\u00ad ers who are over 25 years old are women. Eighty percent of those over 25 who make less than minimum wage are women. Almost half of these women are not married, which means they are not merely earning a second income to supplement that of their husbands. Instead they are desperate\u00ad ly trying to feed their families and themselves on a completely inad\u00ad equate income. And even those who are bringing in a second income are not doing it for kicks, but because their families des-perately need that added income. There can be no excuse for paying an unfair wage to these workers. This desperately needed increase in the minimum wage is a compromise. It is a compromise which works within the boundaries of what President Bush has claimed to be an acceptable wage. I urge my colleagues to join me in strong support of this long-overdue measure. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. UPTON]. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the legislation that is being offered this afternoon. I note that nei\u00ad ther side, neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are necessarily jump\u00ad ing up and down about this bill. My Democratic colleague and friend from Kentucky a few minutes ago called it a sellout to President Bush. Let me tell Members, some of my Republican colleagues are saying the same thing, except not to President Bush, but to big labor, as well. I have always supported a modest in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage if it was tied to a training wage, particularly to help those that are entering the job market for the first time so that they can get their job skills and work ethics developed particularly at an early age. That is exactly what this bill does. Last spring, I joined with a number of my colleagues to sustain President Bush's veto on the minimum wage bill because it was too high, and it was not the $4.25 raise that we see this after\u00ad noon. Instead, it was a much higher rate, $4.55. To President Bush's credit, he came down from the 6-month train\u00ad ing wage he was insisting on last spring. He came down, in essence, to the 3-month training wage. He also came down from a 3-year to April 1991 when this will kick in fully. I think that was a major compromise. I applaud the President for what he did, and I support the action this afternoon. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. APPLEGATE]. Mr. APPLEGATE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, but with some reservations. There are no win\u00ad ners in this. It is a modest raise of 90 cents per hour over 2 years. The work\u00ad ing people, the working poor of the country are still going to be very poor. Those who oppose, and I have heard this argument before, say there is going to be a loss of jobs, there is going to be more drugs, there is going to be more inflation. That is baloney. Let those people struggle to exist on $3.35, let alone $4.25. It is very diffi\u00ad cult to be able to sustain a quality of life, to be able to buy the food, the clothing, and shelter, to be able to have health insurance. A person will not get it on that. If a person has a family, it makes it even more difficult. In 1981 $3.35 was too low. Inflation\u00ad let me tell Members about inflation. If this will cause inflation, there has been inflation since 1981, and there has not been any increase. Inflation has eroded the dollar bill by 40 per\u00ad cent. That makes the 1981 wage on today's market only worth $2. Try living on that. Well, 15 million people are, and the taxpayers are subsidizing them. Yes, at best it is modest. However, in the subminimum wage, 16-to 19-year-olds, actually reduces the minimum wage to below the mini\u00ad mum wage of $3.35. They will only get $3.25 an hour. They say there will be more unemployment. Well, if this logic stands, why do we not just reduce it to $1 an hour, then we can eliminate all of the unemployment possibilities. That is just as ridiculous. More drugs? Well, let me tell Mem\u00ad bers this: Most parents, in making $4.25, both parents have to work, and in some instances they have to work more than one job, which means there is less time at home. The kids are at home by themselves. They are watch\u00ad ing TV. They are listening to all the violence. They are out on the streets committing crimes. They are getting more drugs. There is more sex, more pregnancies. Then who ends up paying for that? The taxpayers pay for that, too. I think this is a very modest bill, but these low-income people, they only want to earn a decent living, and they are not going to get it with this, a quality of life that they have not had. They would like to have just a piece of it. They will get less than that. There are 25 million people working who do not have any health insurance at all. The rich are getting richer and the rest are getting less. Let Members give them just a little bit more. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. BALLENGER]. Mr. BALLENGER. Mr. Chairman, I have from the very beginning been against the idea of a minimum wage, and if it were not for the training wage in this bill and the fact that EITC has been at least brought for\u00ad ward with the possibility of being used this time, I probably would have voted against it. However, what I love about this bill, and nobody has talked about it yet, is the fact that Congress is fi\u00ad nally going to get under the Fair Labor Standards Act, in operation of their body here. For those Members who have never been on the outside world with workers and so forth to apply, I want Members to recognize that Members will have to start keep\u00ad ing time on their employees, and will have to decide which ones are clerical, secretarial, computer, case workers, and all others not excluded, under the executive, administrative, or prof es\u00ad sional exemption, and those people 26814 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 the Members will have to keep time on because if a person works them over 40 hours a week, we are going to have to pay time and a half. I can see where the midnight oil and the nights over in our office buildings may be not burning as late in the future because we have finally sacri\u00ad ficed ourselves on the benefits we force on our fell ow man that produce in the country. Let me say we will have to have veri\u00ad fiable time sheets. I think it would be nice if we had timeclocks at the door of every office in the legislature so that we will then be able to keep records and be honest in paying our employees what they truly deserve. If Congress actually employs this law the way that business has to do outside of this body, there will be a lot of people that will find out they run very sloppy offices, and if some of their employees would like to sue them, I will be glad to help them any way I can, since I have been sued by my employees. I would like to see where the money will come in every Member's budget to pay the time and a half that will have to be paid. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. KLECZKA]. Mr. KLECZKA. Mr. Chairman, one of the first bills I introduced as a new Member of Congress was an increase in the minimum wage. Now, some 4 years later we are final\u00ad ly going to see that dream I had some\u00ad time ago finally come true. It would behoove Members to bestow extreme gratitude on the chairman, the gentleman from California [Mr. HAWKINS], and also the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Penn\u00ad sylvania [Mr. MURPHY], who have stuck by their guns and fought long and hard for this compromise, even though I join the litany of my Demo\u00ad cratic colleagues and indicate that I will today hold my nose and vote for this bill, which has a lot of shortcom\u00ad ings. 0 1340 We are told that tht=: minimum wage will now be applied to a lot of people who are not heads of households. I say that is not really accurate for many people who have a minimum wage job are the head of a household. However, we also have to recognize that there are many two-family earners, the second of which, the spouse, has a minimum wage job. I guess if we leave it to the same people who say this bill is more than adequate, they will tell us that the second spouse is working for either pocket money or vacation money, and clearly that is not the case. They are working to pay the mortgage, to pay utility bills, to send their children to college. The teenage wage contained in this bill I believe is a very sad proposal. Again, the opponents of the bill would have us believe that these children are just working a couple of hours a day for some spending money, whereas, when you are 18, 19, and 20 years old, these are the dollars that are going to put you through college or pay for your room and board at school. By the time the training wage period is over, the teens are back to school and have not raised sufficient funds to pay for even a small part of their education. Another item that has not been talked about much in the bill is the in\u00ad crease in the tip credit. I assume that most people believe that tipped employees, be they bar\u00ad tenders, waiters, or waitresses, make $3.35 an hour. However, that is not the case. Under current minimum wage law, this individual makes $2.01 an hour. Because of the changes in this legisla\u00ad tion, the total increase for a tipped employee will go from $2.01 an hour to $2.09 an hour in 1 year. This is one penny a year since the last minimum wage increase. When fully phased in, that employee will get $2.13 an hour. So when Members leave the session today, and for those who happen to go to a restaurant, do not wait with baited breath for that tipped employ\u00ad ee to say thank you for supporting this bill, because initially it is going to have the effect of raising their wages from $2.01 to $2.09. However, we do finally increase the base minimum wage. That increase takes us to $4.25 an hour. So, Mr. Chairman, I will vote for this piece of legislation, because it is better than nothing. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. HENRY]. Mr. HENRY. Mr. Chairman, let me simply say that sometimes life within the four walls of this Chamber gets a bit bizarre. It is a little interesting to hear debate where the right criticizes the bill because it goes too far, the left criticizes the bill because it does not go far enough, and yet each side comes in and says they reluctantly support it. I may be the odd man out, and I think this is a healthy compromise. I believe our chairman, even though he has concerns with this bill and would like to set it go further, and I know the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GoonLING] has some concerns, wishing we could have refined to greater perfection some of the train\u00ad ing wage initiatives, I happen to think it really finally moves us forward. We have been at loggerheads at this for several years and have made no progress. I really believe we should be celebrating the fact that at least we are off our duffs, as it were, and have done something which first of all ad\u00ad dresses the problem of reflecting changes in the wage base, while at the same time not doing so in such a way which drives inflation up in the wage base, that becomes counterproductive by creating job elimination to those most vulnerable to job loss because of lack of employability. I believe this is a defensible compro\u00ad mise. It is not only honorable, but I believe it is good for the working people of this country and also some\u00ad thing which is not in the least adverse to the business interests of this coun\u00ad try. Mr. Chairman, I am here relatively without qualification, and not upset with the compromise. I would give credit to the President, who got both sides down to the bargaining table to reach an agreement that would strike the proper balance in the Congress. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. HEFNER]. Mr. HEFNER. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the debate on this bill and listening to the rhetoric about minimum wage. I have gotten some lit\u00ad erature out from back when the last minimum wage was brought up for a vote on this House floor, and that the debate went something like this: If you pass this minimum wage, it is going to cause massive unemployment; it is going to drive inflation right out of the ceiling; it does not help that many people. Mr. Chairman, let me tell Members some of the people it does help. If Members go to their district office, I am assuming that a lot of them are not unlike mine all over this country. We have people coming in where maybe the husband has got a terminal illness and has had to leave his job, and the wife has no job skills and has to go into the market to try to make enough money to buy the medicine to fill these prescriptions working on minimum wage. These people have got a little Social Security check coming in and she has to work on a minimum wage. This is who it is going to help. Members say it is not going to help a lot of people. Do we make all of our determinations on the numbers of people that get help? I do not believe that is the way we should operate around here. The argument has been made it is only going to help a lot of youngsters who are not heads of households, that are just part of families, not having to support a wife or child. What is wrong with that? Maybe they are going to take this money to help pay their way through school. Maybe they are going to help these parents that are just barely getting by, maybe to buy them that automobile that they want. What is wrong with that? November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26815 Mr. Chairman, we are long overdue on this. There are Members on this side that talked about this training wage. I always have supported a training wage. But for 6 months they talk about this as too short. This is too long. Let me tell Mem\u00ad bers what can be done in 6 months. I was watching a documentary the other night. Our FBI agents do not get 6 months training. That is a pretty spe\u00ad cialized job. You can learn to drive an M-1 tank and be sent overseas in less than 6 months. You can learn to fly an F-16 in less than 6 months. So we have a bill that I am going to support, but I think we would have been much better off to have had a shorter training period. It is going to help a lot of people. For those that say it does not help the right people, I would challenge them, and I would ask Members to do this: Members that are critical of this bill, go to their district of fices. Spend some time there and talk to these people that are coming in, that are trying to make a living and stay on the work roles on minimum wage. You just cannot make it. I want to congratulate the chairman for hanging to his guns. This is not as much as we would like. I come from a district that has a lot of textile work\u00ad ers that are trying to keep their jobs. This minimum wage is going to be some help to the people in my district. Let me just finish with this: The only people that I have had calls from urging me to vote against the mini\u00ad mum wage are people that are making salaries in excess of six digit figures. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con\u00ad sume. Mr. Chairman, first of all I would like to clear up a couple of misconcep\u00ad tions that I thought I heard being of\u00ad fered during the debate. First of all, the youth training wage cannot be below $3.35. It was men\u00ad tioned this could be $3.21 or some\u00ad thing of that nature. It cannot be. It must be at least $3.35. Second, I think it is important to un\u00ad derstand this is new hire we are talk\u00ad ing about, not a first hire. A couple of times I heard that interchanged. It is new hire when we are talking about a training wage, not a first hire. The third thing I would like to cor\u00ad rect, I think it was mentioned that if an employee happens to be a tipped employee he might make as low as $2.01. You cannot make below $3.35 in present law, because if you do not get the tip to get that far, you must be paid the $3.35. So I think it is impor\u00ad tant to clarify those three. Let me now just talk about a couple of other issues very briefly. I plead with those Members who seem to believe that the sky is going to fall in if we have a youth opportunity wage. Folks, stop living in the past. The past is gone. We have 25 million illiterates in this country today, illiter\u00ad ate adults. We have another 50 million functional illiterate adults in this country today. Fifteen years ago these people could have gotten a job and you would have never known the difference. That is gone forever. Somebody has to help them. Just having a subminimum wage to help train those who have no available skills, very little education, is not going to get us there totally. We are going to have to have some kind of tax credits, et cetera, I am sure to get in\u00ad dustry to help us to do that job. 0 1350 However, Mr. Chairman, my col\u00ad leagues live in today's world and to\u00ad morrow's world, and we are telling 75 million Americans that we do not care about them, we are not going to do anything to help them get an employ\u00ad able skill, to help them get some addi\u00ad tional education. It is today we are talking about, and tomorrow, so that the sky is not going to fall, but in fact we are going to help those people join many of us who enjoy the privilege \u00b7of working and the income that comes from it because we are going to help train them, and we are going to help educate them. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that we are only talking about those who are less than 20 years of age because, my colleagues, millions of those people fall in that 20-to-30-age bracket, that 20-to-40-age bracket, no salable skill, very little education and no one out there to help them become trained\" so that they can be part of the work force, and, if my colleagues want to think selfishly, how are we going to be competitive if we do not do something about those 75 million people? No one is there to do the job. Mr. Chairman, I do have one other concern. I have discussed this with the subcommittee chairman on several oc\u00ad casions, and that is that concern that we have left the word \"seasonal\" in this bill in relationship to any submin\u00ad imum wage for those who are age 16 to 20, not seasonal, migrant workers. We are talking about neighbors who come to someone and ask, \"Would you give me a job for the summer on this farm?\", and then we are saying to the farmer, \"You are different than any other employer. You don't have an op\u00ad portunity to give them, a youth, the opportunity wage because you're a farmer.\" Now, as I calculate it, one could very quickly with four employees on a farm, a fruit farm particularly, very quickly use up their 500 man-days in a previous quarter and, therefore, they could not offer a subminimum wage to that 16-year-old kid who lives down the street from them or down the lane from them if they are a farmer. It is discrimination, it seems to me, to the farmers in this country. Mr. Chairman, as many others have said, no one got what everyone wanted, and I have never seen a bill pass the House of Representatives where that is true. It seems to me by the unanimous consent today that was taken care of, the most unbelievable thing that no one caught until last night when we questioned it, and ap\u00ad parently just opposite of what the gentlemen from the other body wanted to include, but the way it was written it would have included those of us here in the Congress of the United States in relationship to com\u00ad puter operations. Everyone in my office operates the computer, and I would assume the way the gentlemen had it written that it would have meant that everyone in my office had to be at least $59,000 or 6112 times the minimum wage. Mr. Chairman, that would have created havoc here, but think what it would have done throughout this entire country in an industry that is trying to be very, very, very competitive, and it is very diffi\u00ad cult for them to be with the rest of the world. My colleagues, no one got exactly what they wanted. I think we have the best we can get at this particular time. I would hope that we could continue to talk about that seasonal youngster out there, as far as farm work is con\u00ad cerned, and I would hope again that those who think the sky is falling come into this century and realize that we have a big job to do with at least 75 million functionally illiterate adults in this country. So, Mr. Chairman, I would encour\u00ad age all to support what we now have. It is the best we could do. No one is a winner. That must mean that every\u00ad one out there that we are writing the bill for is a winner since no one thinks they are a winner here in the Congress of the United States. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. CARPER]. Mr. CARPER. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin my remarks by compliment\u00ad ing the chairmen of the committee and subcommittee, the ranking Re\u00ad publicans and each of those who have worked to draft this compromise before us today. It is a long overdue compromise. I think for the most part it is one worth waiting for. Mr. Chairman, the price of few things in our country have remained unchanged during the course of the last 8 years. The price that we pay for our food, the price that we pay for our clothing, the price that we pay for transportation, the price that we pay for health care, all have risen. For the 26816 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 most part, they have risen apprecia\u00ad bly. In this body, our salaries have been raised over the last 8 years. In the ex\u00ad ecutive branch, cabinet officials have seen their salaries raised over the last 8 years as well. The salaries we pay our Federal judges, in fact, the wages of most people in this country, have gone up over the last 8 years. Mean\u00ad while, the minimun wage has re\u00ad mained $3.35 per hour. The disparity could have been even greater. During the last year alone we have had a President who recommend\u00ad ed that our salaries and those of cabi\u00ad net officials and Federal judges rise by another 51 percent. During the past year, we have seen a majority of our colleagues in this body support a cap\u00ad ital gains tax break adding tens of thousands of dollars in new income to some of the wealthiest people of our Nation. Before us today we have a delicately crafted compromise that seems to give a modest boost to the lowest paid in this country. It is delicate because on the one hand we need to raise the min\u00ad imum wage high enough to encourage those who do not now work to work, high enough to encourage people who may be on welfare to exchange that welfare check for a pay check and high enough to enable adults with families to support to begin to climb out of poverty. However, Mr. Chairman, while we want to raise the minimum wage high enough to make a difference for those people, we do not want to raise it so high that we further undermine our Nation's competitive position, and we do not want to raise the minimum wage so high that we cause employers to lay people off in large numbers. Mr. Chairman, I especially want to commend those who have worked on this compromise for addressing what I thought was a major deficiency in the President's proposal. That proposal stipulated that a person of any age who would take a minimum wage job could work at a subminimum wage for 6 months, move to work for a different employer at a subminimum wage for another 6 months, still another em\u00ad ployer for another 6 months, and on and on. That was neither fair nor equi\u00ad table, and I particuarly commend those who have worked this compro\u00ad mise out on that score. Let me finally say that, when we couple this modest increase in the minimum wage with the increase in the earned income tax credit, the com\u00ad bined effect for the working poor is significant. I want to commend my col\u00ad league, the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. PETRI] for the work he and the gentleman from New York [Mr. DOWNEY] have done in this regard. When we combine this modest in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage with the increase we have approved earlier in this body in the earned income tax credit, we have in the aggregate done something that will make a difference for, not just for tens of thousands of adults and teenagers in this country, but for hundreds of thousands, even millions, of workers and their families. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. PENNY]. Mr. PENNY. Mr. Chairman, after months, in fact years of bickering, today we finally agree to increase the minimum wage in a way that reflects concerns for the working poor as well as the concerns expressed by small business owners. Under the provisions of the compromise agreed to by Presi\u00ad dent Bush and the democratic leader\u00ad ship, the minimum wage will be in\u00ad creased in two yearly steps to $4.25, beginning April 1, 1990. The agreement also provides that employers could pay a subminimum\u00ad or \"training\" -wage for 90 days to workers under age 20. Further, upon certification by the Department of Labor, an employee could be paid this training wage for an additional 90 days, provided the teenage worker is engaged in an on-the-job training pro\u00ad gram. During the \"training\" period, an employer would be authorized to pay 85 percent of the applicable minimum wage, and under the compromise, the training wage expires on April 1, 1993, unless reauthorized by law. In addition to the minimum wage in\u00ad crease and the compromise training wage, the agreement reached dropped the provision in the original bill pro\u00ad viding for a Minimum Wage Review Board, provides for an increase in the small business exemption from $362,500 to $500,000, extends the rights and protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act to employees of the House of Representatives, and in\u00ad creases the \"tip-credit\" in two-steps from the current 40 percent to bO per\u00ad cent effective April 1, 1991. Mr. Chairman, this compromise, like all compromises, is not perfect. I would have preferred smaller incre\u00ad ments of increase in the basic mini\u00ad mum wage spread over 3 years. But we compromised. I would have preferred a larger small business exception. But we com\u00ad promised. I would have pref erred no submini\u00ad mum wage at all, but we compromised. In the best spirit of bipartisanship and concern for America's working poor, we all compromised. No one on this floor today got all they wanted in this agreement. But we did the right thing in this agreement by addressing the legitimate concern for working Americans as well as the concerns of America's small employer community. I want to congratulate Speaker ToM FOLEY. Chairmen Gus HAWKINS and AUSTIN MURPHY of the Education and Labor Committee, and all the other parties involved in putting this com\u00ad promise together. As a result of your efforts, we will take the first step in 10 years to increase the minimum wage. You have the gratitude of American workers for your diligence. I urge a yes vote. D 1400 Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. STAGGERS]. Mr. STAGGERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the minimum wage increase, and I commend the chairman of the committee for his hard work. Mr. Chairman, when our constituents tune in the news this evening, I believe that they will hear Dan Rather and his colleagues report that the Congress asserted its moral courage today and voted a few nickels for the hardest working Americans, while still deadlocked over the President's proposal to give a capital gains tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. A few nickels for the men and women who sweep the floors of the Stock Exchange; a few billions for those who speculate there. We stand here day in and day out, encouraging people to work hard and save more, and then we pass laws that say, \"You worked hard today, here's a nice shiny nickel for your trou\u00ad bles.\" Mr. Chairman, when we do things like this, real working people laugh, but their laughter comes through the tears that well in their eyes because they know its going to be another year of struggle. I appreciate the long, hard work my col\u00ad leagues have put into getting even the nickels, and I thank them for it. Something is always better than nothing. But to our tough talking President, who likes catchy phrases and will soon ask to be re\u00ad elected, I have a few slogans that I offer to you free of charge. When you campaign to American working families, try one of these: Tell them: \"No new school clothes.\" Or try, \"No new braces.\" Or the ever popular, \"No new chances.\" Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. HOAGLAND]. Mr. HOAGLAND. Mr. Chairman let me start by thanking the gentleman from California for yielding me some time so I can address the House on this issue. Let me say that it is clearly time for us in this Nation to raise the minimum wage. It has been since January 1981, as others have indicated, way back then the minimum wage went to $3.35 an hour, and there has been substan\u00ad tial depreciation since. I think the facts speak for them\u00ad selves in terms of the need to take this action. Let me just recite some of those facts, if I can. If the minimum wage had kept pace with the rate of inflation since January 1981, it would not be at $4.57 an hour. This bill, of course, provides an increase of only November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26817 $4.25 an hour, not to go into effect for a year and a half. I think quite a few of us were disap\u00ad pointed at that relatively low figure. The minimum wage traditionally has run at about one-half of the average wage for non-supervisory workers in the private sector. Recently it has de\u00ad preciated to about 34 percent of that wage. Finally, in the sixties and seventies, the minimum wage would barely keep a family of three above the poverty line. Now the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour is 29 percent below the pover\u00ad ty line for a three-person family. So there is really no question that it needs to be raised. I think a lot of us would like to see it raised to a higher amount, that in fact would have kept pace with inflation. But due to re\u00ad markable resistance, resistance that I cannot fathom from the White House, we are having to settle now for a figure which I do not think really is adequate, but at least it is something. There is one saving grace in this bill, and that is that this training wage, which has some merits maybe, not a whole lot, at least has a sunset in 4 years. Let me just make this final point, and that is that one saving grace of this bill which does not go high enough, in my opinion, does not even keep pace with inflation, and it is at least this crazy training wage concept sunsets after 4 years. The fact that it sunsets after 4 years might mean to our working men and women friends out in the audience, it might mean that we will be back in 4 years from now instead of 12 years from now to address this issue again, because you will recall that it was 12 years ago when we last passed a minimum wage bill, the last increment of which went into effect 9 years ago. Now at least maybe with this 4-year sunset provision we are going to see an ability by this House to readdress this issue sooner, rather than later. So I will reluctantly support this bill. I think a lot of us feel it should be higher than it is, but at least it is something for the working men and women of this Nation as we approach the Thanksgiving season. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California [Mr. LAGOMARSINO]. Mr. LAGOMARSINO. Mr. Chairman, I sup\u00ad port the bill before us. It is a good compro\u00ad mise. It is about time the House got around to fighting poverty with good policy rather than bad politics. The workers of America should have had a 27-percent raise in their hourly wages months ago when the President first offered to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 hour. That's almost an extra $150 a month that laborers working for the minimum wage could have been bringing home. What kept that extra money out of workers' pockets? Congress rejected the President's proposal and instead sent him a bill that would have cost 100,000 to 200,000 more lost jobs and job opportunities than the President's propos\u00ad al. How does that bad politics help the Ameri\u00ad can worker? Legislation that would raise the minimum wage should be aimed at helping low-income workers bring home more money, not helping politicians bring home more votes. In June I cosponsored the \"Living Wage Act.\" This bill, again, attempted to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour. It also included an increase in the earned income tax credit. This proposal would give aid to those who are most in need of aid. For a family with four pre-school chil\u00ad dren, the credit would be equivalent to an extra $2.08 in hourly wages. A minimum wage worker getting the maximum credit would be bringing home more than $6.25 per hour. That is good policy that helps the American work\u00ad ing poor break the poverty cycle. During the last 8 years, over 19 million new jobs have been created, and the number of workers earning the minimum wage has been almost cut in half. Americans have more jobs and are earning more in those jobs than they did at the beginning of this decade. We cannot afford to stop this growth with a mini\u00ad mum wage bill that does not give employers adequate flexibility to recruit and train new employees. Almost 60 percent of those indi\u00ad viduals earning the minimum wage are be\u00ad tween the ages of 16 and 24 years old. Over one-third are teenagers! Should the low\u00ad income working adult suffer the loss of jobs and job opportunities so that this majority of minimum wage earners can get a raise? For this reason, it is clear that any minimum wage legislation proposal does include a reasonable training period in which an employer can pay a sub-minimum wage. I urge my colleagues to consider these points in our debate on the minimum wage. We need good policy that will help those who most need help, the working poor. Further, we cannot pass a minimum wage bill without a reasonable training wage to minimize the loss of job opportunities for young Americans just entering the work force. A responsible mini\u00ad mum wage bill can help those in need without slowing our current economic growth. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. BOEHLERT]. Mr. BOEHLERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the measure before us. Quite frankly, I was disap\u00ad pointed when a better measure that we approved earlier in the year was vetoed by my President, but a compro\u00ad mise has been worked out. We cannot always get everything we want. This, I think, is a good solid compromise. I think in the final analysis, we all end up winners. It is going to be the first time in nearly a decade that the wage earners, who are the lowest paid in our society, will have an increase. Who else can say that? It has been nearly a decade. It is long overdue. The increase on April 1, 1990, from $3.35 to $3.80 and then a further in\u00ad crease on April 1, 1991 up to $4.25 is long overdue. Mr. Chairman , I want to commend the leadership on both sides of the aisle, and I want to commend our President, because he first indicated in the campaign of 1988 that we needed an increase, and we do. He has ful\u00ad filled a commitment, and so have we. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman , I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MURPHY]. <Mr. MURPHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re\u00ad marks.) Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the impact that a minimum wage increase will have on the Medicaid Program. Almost one half of Medicaid dollars are spent on long\u00ad term care, mostly for the elderly. However, an increase in minimum wage will affect all health care providers. Nursing homes, in particular, employ a large number of minimum wage workers, most of whom are nurses' aides who provide direct, hands-on care to nursing home patients. These salaries are the largest component of Medicaid reimbursement-in fact, all labor costs account for about 72 percent of all nurs\u00ad ing home costs. A federally mandated in\u00ad crease in labor costs must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in Medicaid pay\u00ad ment rates for these labor costs. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee which has jurisdiction over the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA], I have a strong interest in the impact of a minimum wage in\u00ad crease on the nursing home industry. Under the Medicaid Program, individual States have rate-making authority for nursing home care with limited supervision from the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] of the De\u00ad partment of Health and Human Services. Con\u00ad gress must ensure that States increase Med\u00ad icaid nursing home reimbursement rates to take into account changes in the FLSA that will increase labor costs. The Education and Labor Committee recog\u00ad nized in its committee report on H.R. 271 O that a minimum wage increase will have an impact on Medicaid rates paid to long-term care providers. The report language clarified that under title XIX, States are required to pro\u00ad vide assurances to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that their rates are \"rea\u00ad sonable and adequate.\" Section 1902(a)(13) of the Social Security Act requires that States take into account the costs that nursing homes must incur to provide care and serv\u00ad ices in conformity with all applicable State and Federal laws. Although the FLSA is not re\u00ad ferred to specifically in that section, the com\u00ad mittee wishes to emphasize that the wage levels required by the FLSA are among provi\u00ad sions of Federal law which must be taken into account by the States in setting their Medicaid rates. The committee also believes any adjust\u00ad ment made to State Medicaid rates reflect this statutory change and must be done in a timely manner to insure these facilities are receiving the increased rate at the same time they are incurring the increased costs. The nursing home industry is on record as supporting an increase in the minimum wage, 26818 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 but they have requested that we recognize the special cost burden imposed by such in\u00ad creases in this industry, where reimbursable costs are extensively regulated. Major nursing home reform was passed by Congress in 1987 as a part of the Omnibus Budget Recon\u00ad ciliation Act [OBRA], Public Law 100-203. This act required significant changes in staff\u00ad ing and training requirements, quality of care, patient services, and enforcement of new nursing home standards, at an estimated cost of $1.73 billion over 5 years. Because Con\u00ad gress was concerned about the ability of the nursing home industry to absorb costs of this magnitude, special language was included to ensure that the Medicaid reimbursement system adequately accommodated the OBRA 1987 cost increases. The special language adopted in OBRA served to emphasize continuing congressional concern with adequate nursing home reim\u00ad bursement. The payment standard mandating an increase in Medicaid nursing home rates to take account of the new costs that will result from this legislation is already contained in sect.ion 1902(a)(13) of the Social Security Act. These cost increases are costs which must be incurred by facilities in the provision of care and services to Medicaid beneficiaries. Consequently, each State's nursing home re\u00ad imbursement rates must be appropriately in\u00ad creased to take account of these costs. I would hope that congressional oversight will ensure that States adequately and appro\u00ad priately adjust their Medicaid reimbursement rates to reflect higher minimum wage levels mandated in our compromise. Mr. Chairman, I include the following corre\u00ad spondence: .AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL OR\u00ad GANIZATIONS, Washington, DC, November 1, 1989. Hon. AUSTIN MURPHY, Chairman , Subcommittee on Labor Stand\u00ad ards, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington , DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MURPHY: The AFL-CIO wishes to convey to you our support for the long-overdue agreement on the minimum wage issue between the Bush administration and the Congress that will be offered today as a substitute to H.R. 2710, the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989. After nearly nine years without an adjust\u00ad ment, America's minimum wage workers, so often women, minorities and single heads of households, have suffered economic stagna\u00ad tion far too long. The prompt enactment into public law of this modest increase for America's lowest\u00ad paid workers is essential, along with the drafting and implementation of regulations to strictly govern the training wage compo\u00ad nent for 16-through 19-year-old workers, which will expire in April 1993. The AFL\u00ad CIO believes the provision for a training wage contains adequate safeguards so the youth are not exploited and older workers are not displaced. We urge your colleagues to join you in the passage of H.R. 2710, as amended by the agreement's language. Sincerely, Ro BERT M. McGLOTTEN, Director, Department of Legislation. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. I do that because I would certainly be remiss if I did not say \"thank you\" to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. PETRI], who probably has done more in the last couple years to help the working poor than any hundred people in the Congress of the United States. It was he who carried the EITC battle. It is that particular part in the child care bill that is really going to help the working poor, and I want to pay tribute to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. PETRI] at this time. Mr. DREIER of California . Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Murphy substitute amendment to the bill (H.R. 2710) before us today to increase the Federal minimum wage. I was pleased to vote to sustain President Bush's earlier veto of a minimum wage in\u00ad crease, and I will vote against the Murphy substitute amendment and against final pas\u00ad sage of H.R. 271 O for the same reasons which I opposed the previous minimum wage proposal. Mr. Chairman, instead of creating new jobs and greater opportunity for our Na\u00ad tion's 3.9 million minimum wage earners, this legislation will destroy jobs and job-producing activities. Like H.R. 2, this so-called minimum wage compromise calls for an increase in the Fed\u00ad eral minimum wage to $4.25 per hour effective April 1, 1991. This increase amounts to a nearly 29-percent rise over the next 2 years. Although opponents of a mandated Federal increase in the minimum wage gained some ground with the inclusion of a training wage, this new wage will only apply to workers under age 20 and for just 90 days under a single employer. Since California's minimum wage is current\u00ad ly $4.25 per hour, the increase in the Federal minimum wage is not expected to effect Cali\u00ad fornia minimum wage earners directly. Howev\u00ad er, this increase would have a significant neg\u00ad ative impact on workers in those States with weak labor markets or strong service-oriented economies. Instead of increasing the Federal minimum wage, Congress should give States the flexi\u00ad bility to tailor their minimum wage laws to meet distinct dynamics of the Nation's region\u00ad al economic markets and work force. An addi\u00ad tional increase in the Federal minimum wage will obviously distort those markets, and its negative effects will fail disproportionately on workers in depressed areas. The Murphy substitute amendment does not make sufficient changes in H.R. 271 O to negate the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs expected to be realized by its enactment. As amended by Murphy or as re\u00ad ported by the House Education and Labor Committee, H.R. 2710 will hurt the working poor we purportedly are trying to assist by in\u00ad creasing the Federal minimum wage. Mr. Chairman, Congress is saying to these Americans that, despite the evidence to the contrary, an increase in the Federal minimum wage will benefit them. However, many of these Americans understand that we are really costing them the opportunity to gain or secure a better job. Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2710, the Fair Labor Stand\u00ad ards Amendments of 1989. Once again we stand in this chamber to debate the issue of raising the minimum wage, and over such minute changes from the first bill. The current proposal calls for the Federal minimum to be raised from its current level of $3.35 per hour to $4.25 over the next 2 years and allows employers to pay certain employ\u00ad ees a subminimum wage for up to 2 months. Since the establishment of the current mini\u00ad mum wage in 1981 , its purchasing power has decreased by 36 percent. The earnings of a full-time minimum wage worker for a 3-person family has dropped to 29 percent below the poverty level. Two thirds of the 600,000 American women who maintain a family and work at minimum wage are in poverty. Of this group, three quar\u00ad ters of the black female-headed households live in poverty. Why do we continue to ignore statistics. Let us not forget that there are real people behind these numbers that need our help. I must ask my colleagues: Do we remember the purpose of a minimum wage? Historically, the goal is to give workers the opportunity to earn money to support themselves and their family. An effective minimum wage allows new people to join the workforce at a sufficient income to survive and moves them toward as\u00ad suming a positive role in a complex inflation\u00ad ary society. By setting an adequate pay scale for entry level positions, we convey ideas that encourage the public to join the workforce and realize that benefits do result from hard work. Or-we can continue to subject them to in\u00ad sufficient pay and an introduction to the world of poverty, crime and despair. Today, as a result of consistently rising inflation and a min\u00ad imum wage that has not changed, we are pointing them toward the latter course. How long can we allow this declining situation to exist? I find it disturbing that the President, who advocates a \"kinder and gentler America\" vetoed past minimum wage legislation for those who need this compassion the most. And why? For a mere 30 cents discrepancy. Then Mr. Bush adamantly advocates the pas\u00ad sage of a capital gains tax cut, which benefits those with incomes of over $100,000. Do we realize that an income of $100,000 a year is at least 14 times the salary of a minimum wage earner? Tax cuts as the capital gains are supposed to trickle down to the poor, yet for all of Amer\u00ad ica's economic good fortune over the past 8 years not one cent has gone for a minimum wage increase. But inflation continues to flow down the ladder. America, the land of opportunity: How do we expect hard working Americans to realize these opportunities when they cannot afford the basic necessities of food, clothing and shelter if we do not pay them enough? A below-poverty level pay scale will never allow them to satisfy basic needs and intro\u00ad duce them to the productive side of our econ\u00ad omy. They will never enjoy quality medical care and child care if we do not act. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26819 The earlier, progressive version of minimum wage legislation passed by the House would have done more for the working poor than what we discuss today. We were forced by the President to consider this weaker compro\u00ad mise version, which will not be a panacea for the ills that effect the lower class. There are those who still must live in homeless shelters and accept welfare for survival. Are we offer\u00ad ing too little too late? We were elected to represent all facets of American society. Let us not neglect those who need our help. I urge my colleagues and the President to support this measure. Mr. MFUME. Mr. Chairman, today we are here to discuss the Fair Labor Standards Act H.R. 2710, or the minimum wage bill. It has been 12 years since Congress last enacted revisions for a minimum wage increase. Eight whole years have gone by since the hard working men and women of America had an increase beyond $3.35. Individuals and families earning minimum have had to survive off of $3.35 while their overall purchasing power decreased by 36 percent. Had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation, the wage rate would be $4.57 per hour. For the 4 million American workers who earn the minimum wage and the other 8 million who will be effected by this legislation, I believe that it is time to provide the econom\u00ad ic relief that will help enable these individuals to better realize their dreams and aspirations. Opponents of the minimum wage bill are quick to point out that teenagers are the per\u00ad sons who primarily work at entry level, un\u00ad skilled minimum wage jobs. However, the sta\u00ad tistics produced by the Federal Minimum Wage Commission indicates that approximate\u00ad ly 69 percent of all minimum wage workers are adults over the age of 20 with women dominating the largest demographic category. Eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds make up the remaining 31 percent of minimum wage earn\u00ad ers. Mr. Chairman, when we look at the cost of living expenses in the greater Baltimore area, I am truly amazed that anyone can survive on $3.35. The President realizes this fact as well, which may be what prompted him to compro\u00ad mise yesterday on an increase to $3.80 over one year and $4.25 by the year 1991. Mr. Chairman, I call upon our colleagues today to vote in favor of the minimum wage bill to increase the earnings of those house\u00ad holds who depend on minimum wage salaries for their daily bread. Mr. ESPY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in sup\u00ad port of the Federal minimum wage increase agreed upon by the Congress and administra\u00ad tion. This is the first and long overdue minimum wage increase for the working men and women of America in almost 1 O years. This bill essentially seeks to offset the devastation inflation has had on the purchasing power of the minimum wage for the past 7 years. The measure has been carefully crafted to incor\u00ad porate the needs and concerns of small busi\u00ad nesses, the provisions which exempts small businesses with gross sales under $500,000, allows a subminimum wage for teenagers, and increases the tip credit from its present 40 percent to 50 percent clearly ir1dicate a com-mitment to the continued enhancement of small businesses. I strongly support these measures. In reference to the concerns of farmers that the legislation outrageously and unfairly ex\u00ad cludes agriculture from the training wage pro\u00ad visions: this applies to seasonal employees who work approximately four months, thus failing to qualify for the 6 months subminimum wage requirement. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this non-partisan legislation. It is both compassionate and common sense. Mr. DELAY. Mr. Chairman, we've heard an awful lot of rhetoric here on the floor today about how this bill is going to help the poor and lift them out of poverty. We've heard rhet\u00ad oric about how this bill is the best way to ensure that low skilled and unskilled can re\u00ad ceive a dignified, respectable wage. However, we should remember that the last time Congress enacted a minimum wage in\u00ad crease which was phased in between 1977 and 1981, we destroyed 644,000 jobs accord\u00ad ing to the Minimum Wage Study Commission. Mr. Chairman, I sincerely doubt that those workers who were thrown out of their jobs ap\u00ad preciated their new dignified wage. Congress needs to closely look at the facts. According to a study by the American Enter\u00ad prise Institute, 93 percent of minimum wage workers are not heads of households. Eighty percent of families with a minimum wage earner live above the poverty line, according to estimates by the Council of Economic Advi\u00ad sors. In fact, over 70 percent of the families live above 150 percent of the poverty line. Keep in mind that the history has demon\u00ad strated that a competitive and flourishing economy provides the best help to all work\u00ad ers. Since we have held the line on minimum wage increases, our economy has generated over 19 million new jobs. Yet during that same period of time we have actually cut the number of minimum wage workers in half. Competitiveness creates good jobs. According to the U.S. Chamber of Com\u00ad merce, it has been estimated that 53,715 jobs would be lost in the State of Texas alone out of the more than three-quarters of 1 million people who will be thrown out of work by this bill. An estimated 4,059 jobs would be lost in my district alone. The majority of workers who will lose their jobs are youths who will be turned out onto the street to idle the hours away. I suspect that soon after this increase takes effect next year, Members of the House will be calling for more funding to fight the drug problem plagu\u00ad ing our Nation. And what's more, is that they'll be blaming youth and minority unemployment as one of the leading causes. No, Mr. Chairman, I'm not ready to throw these people out of work. No, Mr. Chairman, I'm not ready to tell my constituents they must face a new round of inflationary price in\u00ad creases. Don't tell the people that you're here to help the working poor. Don't tell the people that you're here to help the minorities. Be\u00ad cause this bill just won't do that. Be honest with your constituents. Tell them you support increasing unemployment, espe\u00ad cially among the poor and minorities because they will be hurt the most by this legislation. Mr. HOUGHTON. Mr. Chairman, President Bush has fulfilled his commitment to the American people by working with the Con\u00ad gress to reach a compromise so that the mini\u00ad mum wage will at long last be raised. This action, together with the increase in the earned income tax credit which we ap\u00ad proved as part of the budget reconciliation act, will help deprived Americans who have suffered from the delays in approving these changes. Speaking from my prior life, there are not too many people here who have been in busi\u00ad ness-had to meet a payroll-look into the face of a wage increase. One can usually handle such a move unless of course there is an economic disaster. But it can only be done gradually. The average profit margin of busi\u00ad ness in this country is less than 5 percent this is not a lot to play with. The compromise here gives time, permits the job producers to adjust their cost structure. It is a good bill. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I wish to expess both my support for H.R. 2710, the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989, and my understanding of the implications this legislation would have on nursing homes reim\u00ad bursement under the Medicaid Program. Medicaid is the Federal-State entitlement program that buys basic health care services for certain categories of poor people, including the low-income elderly. About 30 percent of all Medicaid spending goes toward the pur\u00ad chase of nursing home services. Nursing homes, in turn, employ large numbers of mini\u00ad mum wage workers; most of these are nurse aides, who provide the bulk of the hands-on care to nursing home residents. H.R. 271 o will increase the salaries of these workers. Current Medicaid law requires that the rates which States pay to nursing homes for serv\u00ad ices to Medicaid-eligible residents be \"reason\u00ad able and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economi\u00ad cally operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applica\u00ad ble State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards.\" Clearly, the Fair Labor Standards Act is an \"applicable Federal law,\" and the wages of nursing home workers are costs \"which must be incurred by efficiently and economically op\u00ad erated facilities in order to provide care and services.\" As chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, with legisla\u00ad tive and oversight jurisdiction over the Medic\u00ad aid Program, I want to affirm the obvious: Cur\u00ad rent Medicaid law requires States to adjust their nursing home reimbursement rates to ac\u00ad commodate the increased costs that nursing homes incur in complying with the increase in the minimum wage. Of course, the Federal Government, through Medicaid matching pay\u00ad ments, will participate in payments for these increased costs. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2710, the Fair Labor Standards Act. I urge my colleagues to sup\u00ad port this measure to provide working families in the United States legitimate economic op\u00ad portunities to fully support their families by ac\u00ad cepting a long overdue increase in the mini\u00ad mum wage. 26820 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 The minimum wage has not been increased since 1981 , the longest duration the wage has remained at the same level. In that time, the actual buying power of the wage has de\u00ad creased by 38 percent. In that same period, we have documented the largest !ncrease in our homeless popula\u00ad tion among the working poor, and an increase in the number of single-parent families. These are people who are striving to earn a living for basic survival-to house and feed themselves. How can we expect these families, struggling to make ends meet, to pay rent, clothe and feed themselves when the current minimum wage will put a family of three 29 percent below the recognized poverty level? Nearly 4 million Americans work at jobs that pay the minimum wage or less. Close to an\u00ad other 4 million earn slightly above the current minimum wage. According to the Department of Labor, 70 percent of these individuals are adults. At least 25 percent of those earning the minimum wage are heads of households and two-thirds of them are women. The large majority of these women are pri\u00ad mary wage earners for their families. Ten mil\u00ad lion American households are headed by women today, an increase of 80 percent since 1980. We must recognize the significance of this situation. Working women must be given the legitimate economic means to fully sup\u00ad port their families. The minimum wage must reflect a livable standard for an American family. I oppose the training wage and would prefer a bill which has no provision for such a con\u00ad sideration. I urge my colleagues to support a mo:\u00b7e eq\u00ad uitable rate of pay, critically important to our Nation's working women and working poor. Action is urgently needed to restore the pur\u00ad chasing power of the minimum wage. Mr. FAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that after several years, we have been able to forge a bill to raise the minimum wage. This Nation's work ethic has centered on the belief that hard work deserves adequate compensation and that every American war\u00ad rants a wage high enough to achieve a decent standard of living. Unfortunately, we have failed to live up to that commitment. The last time the minimum wage was in\u00ad creased was in 1981, when it was raised to $3.35 an hour. Today it remains at that level, yet its purchasing power has decreased by 36 percent. In 1981 dollars, it is worth only $2.46. The minimum wage provides a real boost to the working poor, many of whom are single mothers. An adequate minimum wage is also vital to the many students who must put them\u00ad selves through college and depend on mini\u00ad mum wage jobs. These individuals are not looking for handouts, just a decent wage for the work that they do. An increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. It will benefit almost 8 million hourly minimum wage workers and 2 million salaried workers who pay per hour is near the mini\u00ad mum wage. As a matter of economic justice and as a signal that we value these workers, it is time we raise the minimum wage. Ms. SNOWE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the bipartisan substitute to H.R. 2710. I believe this substitute provides a rea\u00ad sonable compromise between the need to in-crease the minimum wage and the fears that such an increase would ultimately result in job loss, inflation, and hurt small businesses. I am pleased that the House was able to work out its differences with the administration on this issue. This substitute provides an ef\u00ad fective way to meet the goal we all hold-that of improving the lives of American workers. I believe that the $4.25 wage will provide assistance to the minimum wage workers without the large job loss associated with a more sizable increase. The Department of Labor has estimated that increasing the wage to $4.25 instead of $4.65 would save 400,000 jobs. Also, the buying power for a minimum wage worker has fallen 36 percent since 1981. This 90-cent increase will help close that gap. Since the minimum wage was enacted in 1938, it has consistently been half the aver\u00ad age wage for nonsupervisory workers in the private sector. It i:::: currently 34 percent below this average. The increase to $4.25 provided by the substitute would place the wage back in its historic range. Today we have the opportunity to return the minimum wage to its intended place in our economy. I believe this substitute provides a substantial yet responsible increase in the minimum wage, one which improves the earn\u00ad ing power of workers while not hampering small businesses from job creation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the meas\u00ad ure. Mr. WEISS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to express my support of this bill raising the mini\u00ad mum wage. While I plan to support today's proposal, I do so with great reluctance. We are in the un\u00ad fortunate position of choosing between a very small increase, $0.90, in the minimum wage or nothing. President Bush has vowed to veto an increase above this $4.25 level. We are told that the President has agreed to support today's proposed increase in the minimum wage. This is hardly grounds for joy. While this is certainly a welcome develop\u00ad ment, I must admit, I have some trouble un\u00ad derstanding the President's logic. A few months back, the President vetoed a 3-year increase in the minimum wage to $4.55. He said the proposal would raise un\u00ad employment, particularly among young people, and cause inflation. Interestingly, today's bill would raise the minimum wage at the same rate as the previous bill, but for only 2 years, not 3. I don't remember the President telling us in his veto statement that the minimum wage could be increased for 2 years, not 3. He didn't say that he thought businesses could afford the first two yearly increases in the min\u00ad imum wage. It was just that third year that was going to wreak economic havoc. Obviously, the President was playing poli\u00ad tics. The President's objections to our last bill were not, in fact, substantive. His principled stand against the minimum wage was nothing more than an effort to act aggressively with Congress. At least now we know that Presi\u00ad dent Bush understands that, yes, our econo\u00ad my can afford to pay the least well-off workers a little more. Welcome aboard, Mr. President. It's good to have you along. In the past, I have supported much more substantial increases in the minimum wage. Over the past 1 0 years, the real value of the minimum wage has decreased dramatically. In fact, if the minimum wage had merely kept pace with inflation over this period we would be raising it this year to over $4.60. The original version of minimum wage legis\u00ad lation, which I supported, included a provision which would have increased the wage to $4.65 over 3 years, giving businesses a chance to adjust to the increase, and thereaf\u00ad ter index the minimum wage to increases in the average wage. Unfortunately, this provi\u00ad sion was dropped in the effort to accommo\u00ad date the President's objections to the legisla\u00ad tion. However, I still believe that the only way to avoid the type of deterioration that has oc\u00ad curred over the past decade in the value of the minimum wage is to enact an indexing provision. In addition, this legislation includes a sub\u00ad minimum wage for certain classes of teen\u00ad aged workers for the first time. I have always opposed this type of wage scale and I contin\u00ad ue to do so. However, the legislation allows for the expiration of the subminimum wage in 1993, unless Congress votes to continue it. I hope that we will learn in the next few years that a subminimum wage is unfair, unneces\u00ad sary, and discriminatory and will choose to discontinue it when the opportunity arises. Further, I believe that today's bill, while called a compromise, reflects the concerns of the Bush administration to a far greater extent than it does those of the labor movement and low-income workers in general. This is an un\u00ad fortunate political circumstance. The real losers are people who try to work their way out of poverty, but due to the political calcula\u00ad tions of the Bush administration, will be unable to do so. Finally, this legislation expires in 1991. I sin\u00ad cerely hope that Congress will revisit this issue as soon as possible. Only then will we be able to give the lowest paid workers a fair, indeed reasonable minimum wage. Mr. FRENZEL. Mr. Chairman, this matter is a foregone conclusion. The President and the Congress and the chief interest group backers of the bill have come to a compromise agree\u00ad ment. The bill will be promptly passed, signed, and enacted. I have no desire to prolong the debate, nor to fall on my sword for no good result. Never\u00ad theless, I shall vote against this compromise juggernaut. The arguments against raising the minimum wage, or against having a minimum wage, have not changed. Raising the minimum will cause the least skilled and unskilled employ\u00ad ees, and new entrants to the labor market to lose jobs or opportunities to get jobs. At a higher wage employers will employ slightly more skilled workers. With higher wage costs, employers will pare payrolls. In my district, the State minimum is higher and the entry level wage is even higher still. The increased minimum will not make any dif\u00ad ference there. My vote is simply a mild protest against well-intentioned, make-believe eco\u00ad nomics. The minimum wage makes those who vote for it feel good, but its effects on the economy November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26821 are negative overall. It will happen but it won't help. Mr. POSHARD. Mr. Chairman, by taking fa\u00ad vorable action on the minimum wage, we're living up to a commitment we have to an untold number of hard-working Americans who are trying to make a go of it under very difficult circumstances. We can draw a lot from their daily example of courage, perseverance, and pride. We're giving them a very well-deserved salute for their efforts. We're saying to the working poor of Amer\u00ad ica that their contribution to our economy and our community is worth something. It's valued, it's important, and we appreciate their desire to work for a living, support their families, and send their kids to school. I know a lot of this debate over the wage increase deals with newly hired employees, teenagers, and other specific categories of workers. Those groups are important. But I want us to really consider what we are and are not doing for the men and women who are trying to make a living on the minimum wage. I have to say it's disappointing we could not do more. The compromise we have been forced to reach, in truth, does not go far enough. We've come up 30 cents short of what we wanted for the top end wage. That's a big difference when you add it up over the long, long period of time these workers will be obligated to work under for years to come. If our success this time at raising the wage, an act of fairness and compassion if ever there was one, is any indication of the attitude toward people who want to work in this coun\u00ad try, then we have a real ways to go. I have to tell my colleagues I wish we could have done more. We should have done more. And we cannot shrink from our obligation. And this does not get us off the hook for good. The original bill that would have raised the wage to $4.55 an hour at the top end would have made a big difference in our ability to help the working underclass of this Nation. This compromise makes up some of the ground, but leaves a lot of road for those workers to walk on their own. We've also slowed down the process under which we're providing this increase. That too is part of a compromise, better than nothing, but waiting for the increase to begin in April instead of at the new year means more pre\u00ad cious time lost. The best thing I can say about the training wage is that at least it's scheduled to expire after 3 years. But even on this issue we've lengthened the time limit on how long that wage can be paid. I see help wanted signs in abundance out here-and read about how many employers have to pay well above the minimum wage to attract workers. That's not the case in my dis\u00ad trict. Because of a downturn in the agriculture, coal, and oil industries, my district has taken a real economic hit. We're doing everything we can, believe me, to turn that around, but our area needs jobs, and our workers need a better wage for the jobs they already hold. Despite all of the drawbacks, in the final analysis we have at least taken some action to assist working America. We're saying to the minimum wage breadwinners we care enough to raise your standard of living at least some\u00ad what, and appreciate your dedication to stay\u00ad ing off welfare and in the work force. We must not be complacent and suggest we have done all we can for this sector of American society. Please let us commit our\u00ad selves to developing this vast and wonderful resource for all of us. And let me thank my chairman, the great gentleman from California [Mr. HAWKINS], for his unswerving leadership on this issue. The families living on the minimum wage in south\u00ad ern Illinois know they have a great leader on their side. Mr. SYNAR. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of the new minimum wage compro\u00ad mise bill, but I do so with a great deal of hesi\u00ad tation. As we all know, the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in order to codify the ideal that a good day of work deserved adequate payment. The real value of the minimum wage has dropped so much since 1977 that it now buys only $2.56 worth of goods and services in the marketplace. Unfortunately, this legislation does little to restore the value of the minimum wage, and sends the wrong signal to our country about the value we in Congress place on our mini\u00ad mum wage earners. While I have come to expect the implacable opposition of the Bush administration to a meaningful increase in the minimum wage, I am also disappointed by the opposition of small businesses, who would benefit as minimum wage earners spent their new earnings on main street. I am most troubled by the training wage provisions included in the compromise. These provisions, which cover all workers under the age of 20, will make access to higher educa\u00ad tion even more difficult for our children. At the same time, these provisions give incentives to businesses to replace older workers with workers whom they can pay at the lower, sub\u00ad minimum training wage. These are only two examples of the discriminatory nature of the training wage provisions. I support this legislation because it is the least we can do for those who must work in jobs at or near the minimum wage. However, we can and should do better for those Ameri\u00ad cans, and I am afraid we will have missed our chance with this, another compromise of our commitment to raise the minimum wage. Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I am in strong support of H.R. 2710, the fair labor standards amendments-the bill authorizing an increase in the minimum wage. Mr. Chairman, I believe the Committee on Education and Labor has more than engaged the spirit of compromise which is necessary between the Congress and the White House when a bill has been vetoed and is then brought to the floor of this body for the second time. The President objected to raising the mini\u00ad mum wage to $4.55 which was authorized in H.R. 2. The President vetoed H.R. 2 for that reason. He also wanted a lesser amount, $4.25 as the maximum minimum wage, but he wanted to spread this slight increase over a 3- year period, instead of 2 years. The commit\u00ad tee's new bill, H.R. 2710, bows to the Presi\u00ad dent's wish for the lesser amount of $4.25 per hour-but would still allow those minimum wage workers to receive the maximum amount in 2 years time, rather than 3 years time. That is a fair compromise and one the President finally acknowledged. Mr. Chairman, the subminimum training wage for youths, which the committee bill once again would hdve kept at 60 days, and only for new hires, has been changed as well-again in a spirit of compromise. The change, as agreed to, would permit a subminimum training wage for youths between the ages of 16 and 19 years of age, for a 90- day period. An extension of an additional 90 days can be granted, provided the job is truly a training ground for future employment, and provided the Secretary of Labor so certifies. The subminimum training wage for youths would still sunset, but would do so in 1993 rather than 1992. The effective date for the increase in the minimum wage is April 1, 1.990, rather than in January of next year. Other provisions in the bill, concerning the small business exemption and the \"tip credit\" are in agreement with the Presidents wishes. Mr. Chairman, in 1938 the first minimum wage law was enacted, and would begin to pay workers for the first time in our history a minimum of 25 cents per hour. In the 50 years since, the minimum wage, if enacted at the recommended level of $4.25 per. hour, will have risen by only $4 in a half century. If that statistic isn't sad enough-consider then that the rise in the minimum wage over the past 50 years has amounted to only 8 cents per year. If you consider this hard to be\u00ad lieve, or impossible to imagine in the richest country on Earth-you have only to stop a moment and look around you and let it dawn on you, if it hasn't already, that we are here again today solely because the President vetoed a bill that would have allowed workers to earn the vast sum of $4.5 an hour over the next 2 years. And finally, if those statistics-those facts\u00ad aren't enough to tax your imagination-then consider that we are back again today, giving the President what he demanded-a measley $4.25 per hour as the maximum wage tilat hourly workers can earn-workers who are heads of households, raising children who need food, shelter, medical care, and educa\u00ad tion in today's world of ever-increasing living costs. And lest we forget-nearly two-thirds of today's minimum wage earners are women who are also, in many cases, heads of house\u00ad holds. The last time the minimum wage was raised was in 1977 -when Congress increased it from $2.30 to $2.65 per hour beginning in 1978, eventually reaching the current $3.35 per hour in 1981. Since 1981-9 long years ago-hourly workers earning minimum wages have lost purchasing power amounting to 36 percent compared to other workers. Had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation, it would today stand at $4.57 per hour-or 2 cents more than our original legislation, which the Presi\u00ad dent vetoed, and which we failed to override. 26822 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 Today, a person working full time at mini\u00ad mum wages is earning 29 percent below the official poverty line for a three-person family Mr. Chairman, I hope the bill, H.R. 271 o, is passed today by an overwhelming majority of the Members of the House. Today, we send a signal to the nearly 8 mil\u00ad lion Americans who work for an hourly wage, and who could potentially benefit from an in\u00ad crease in the minimum wage, that this is our modest beginning toward a reversal of the ne\u00ad glect they have suffered over the past 8 years, indeed over the last half century. Let us all pray that this modest increase will enable those minimum wage earners who are teetering on the brink of homelessness to remain sheltered for yet a while longer; will enable them to provide adequate nourishment for their families; will permit them to seek health care when necessary; will grant that they may clothe themselves against the cold winds of winter; and, God willing, obtain at least a modicum of the necessities of life that so many of us take for granted. This bill before is indeed a minimum wage bill-and it is the least we can do in every sense of the word. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to lend my support, with some reservations, to passage of the compromise version of H.R. 2710, the fair labor standards amendments. I support this bill to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 per hour over a 2-year period, partial\u00ad ly restoring the purchasing power of the mini\u00ad mum wage lost since the last increase in 1981. However, the increase is simply not enough. It does not even restore the minimum wage to its 1981 value after inflation. Had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation, it would now stand at $4.68 an hour. Therefore, if we were to vote to increase the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour immediately, we would in effect be approving a cut of 43 cents an hour in the minimum wage. In other words, despite the fact that we vote to increase the minimum wage today, we are still endorsing a cut in the minimum wage from the 1981 level. I think this is disgraceful. The overall cost of living has risen 39.8 per\u00ad cent since 1981; the cost of shelter has risen 46.6 percent; cost of food up 27.5 percent; cost of medical care up 64.2 percent; and per\u00ad sonal and educational costs up 77 .2 percent. In the 1970's, a full-time worker, paid the mini\u00ad mum wage, earned enough to keep a family of three above the poverty line. Today that worker's earnings fall 30 percent below the poverty line for a three-member family. Work\u00ad ing families living near or below the poverty line need an incentive to keep working rather than seek public assistance. Mr. Chairman, this compromise proposal has other serious problems, primarily a train\u00ad ing wage provision that would allow an em\u00ad ployer to pay a subminimum wage for 90 days to employees under the age of 20, and pro\u00ad vides for an additional 90-day period in which a second employer can pay the subminimum wage if he certifies that the workers are re\u00ad ceiving actual job training. This would permit teenage employees to be paid at less than the minimum wage for a full 6 months. It is shameful to treat our young people in this way, as second-class citizens. While I strongly object to these provisions, I believe that raising the minimum wage is so important that I will still vote for passage of this bill. Mr. GOODLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HAWKINS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN.

REVIEW OF CERTAIN ACQUISI\u00ad TIONS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF AIR CARRIERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu\u00ad ant to House Resolution 275 and rule XXIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the fur\u00ad ther consideration of the bill, H.R. 3443. 26826 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 0 1435 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the further consideration of the bill <H.R. 3443) to amend the Fed\u00ad eral Aviation Act of 1958 to provide for review of certain acquisitions of voting securities of air carriers, and for other purposes, with Mr. ECKART <Chairman pro tempore) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, October 31, 1989, the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Bosco] had been disposed of and the bill was open for amendment at any point. Are there further amendments to the bill? Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, as debate proceeded yesterday on the Airline Financial Se\u00ad curities Acquisition Act, it became quite apparent just from discussions with Members on both sides of the aisle that Members are fed up with the reduction of numbers of air carri\u00ad ers, the restricting of competition, the serious concerns raised for airline trav\u00ad elers by the buyouts that load up air carriers with heavy amounts of debt, and that they want something done that is substantive, real, effective. This legislation, this fine tuning of the fit\u00ad ness authority by the Secretary of Transportation paralleling the actions he has already taken in the Northwest Airlines case is the kind of legislation we ought to have in place. We have a good bill. We want to keep it a good bill. My purpose in bringing this legisla\u00ad tion to the floor is not to make a state\u00ad ment but to put something into law that will benefit air travel, that will benefit competition in the airline in\u00ad dustry, that will benefit air travelers and the communities served by these airlines. I think if we keep this bill clean, we are going to have a bill the President can sign into law. I say that because I want to explain in advance that I am opposed to all the other pending amendments as I was to the single amendment yesterday that was adopt\u00ad ed in the Committee of the Whole. The only thing that amendment proved is that Frank Lorenzo is prob\u00ad ably the most unloved person in the airline business and it was a statement on Mr. Lorenzo, not upon the bill. So as we begin the debate this after\u00ad noon, I hope to set a tone for all those who participate and for all the subse\u00ad quent amendments that are going to be offered: They are well intentioned, they seek to address a particular issue of concern to the Members who will be offering those amendments, but in each instance I think we can say we have already covered, in this legisla\u00ad tion, the concerns addressed by these amendments. If yesterday's amend\u00ad ment had never been adopted, the Sec\u00ad retary of Transportation would still have had adequate authority to deal with the issue covered by that amend\u00ad ment. Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield to the gen\u00ad tleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. CLINGER. I thank the gentle\u00ad man for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gen\u00ad tleman on his statement and wish to associate myself with his remarks. I think our objective in a very biparti\u00ad san way is to enact a bill here that can be signed into law. I think we have the prospect of being able to do that. We have a good bill as it is. I think it does take into account the various conflict\u00ad ing views. It is a well-balanced bill. I think it is important that we keep it that way, and therefore, I join with the gentleman in indicating up front that I think it is going to be necessary for us to oppose all amendments, as the gentleman says, as well inten\u00ad tioned as they may be, in the interest of getting a bill that I think is really going to address a serious problem in this country, we need to keep it the way it is. Mr. OBERSTAR. I thank the gentle\u00ad man. Mr. Chairman, there will be amend\u00ad ments, we will have a lively debate, a useful, constructive debate, and I look forward to it, on those several amend\u00ad ments. And I hope that at the end of the day we will have a good bill to send on to the Senate. 0 1440 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. DE FAZIO Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. DEFAZIO: Page 5, line 3, strike \"or\". Page 5, after line 3, insert the following: \"(4) that the acquisition would result in a major reduction in wages, benefits, or number of employees of the air carrier which is not agreed to by the employees and is required primarily as a result of added costs arising out of the acquisition; or Page 5, line 4, strike \"(4)\" and insert \"(5)\". Mr. DEFAZIO <during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the amendment be consid\u00ad ered as read and printed in the RECORD. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, last July 13, I introduced the first bill in the House dealing specifically with the leveraged buyouts of airlines, because of my concern about the future of this industry and the competitiveness and the productivity and the safety of this industry in America. Several weeks ago we began hearings in a markup of the Subcommittee on Aviation from the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. It became clear as we worked through and rewrote the bill that it could be improved from the version I intro\u00ad duced, and it was. Unfortunately, there is one improve\u00ad ment that we neglected to add in the committee, and I would ask my col\u00ad leagues to join me in adding this sec\u00ad tion in the House. The glaring omis\u00ad sion is one that would extend the same coverage that this bill extends. The bill requires the Secretary of Trans\u00ad portation to review these takeover deals and determine whether or not they would jeopardize the future safety of productivity or competitive\u00ad ness of the airline because it would re\u00ad quire massive shedding or sale of gates, airplanes, hangers, and other assets. Unfortunately, what we do is we leave naked the one last major ex\u00ad pense that our airlines have, and that is of the 480,000 people who work for airlines in America. These people are the ones that determine whether or not our airlines fly safely. These people are the ones who determines whether or not the airline will be pro\u00ad ductive, competitive, and profitable into the future. These people certainly have a vested interest, and should have some consideration during these takeovers. It was Mr. Crandall, the chief execu\u00ad tive officer of American, who was com\u00ad menting on the United deal when he said: Imposing extraordinary levels of debt on a airline, particularly without the active coop\u00ad eration of both management and employees will not serve the long-term interests of anyone. We need the cooperation of the em\u00ad ployees in the deal, and they should be given some attention in a takeover process. The Secretary is now going to have to review the business plans which lay out whether or not assets will be sold, and determine whether that should be allowed. The same criteria should be applied to labor, to human capital in this in\u00ad terest. We have heard that this amendment or other amendments would cause a veto. Well, we have in hand three let\u00ad ters from the administration stating unequivocally they will veto this bill without any amendments. Then yes\u00ad terday we were told that if we adopted the Bosco amendment the President will veto the bill twice, and we will be here today, if we adopt my amend\u00ad ment, that that bill bring a third veto down on this bill, perhaps the one that finally does it in. The point is, we are legislators, and we are here to legislate November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26827 and send forward the best bill possible to conference with the Senate, and that bill should include some modicum of consideration for those 480,000 em\u00ad ployees, and whether or not they are going to be the ones who are made to suffer in future buyouts. This is an important amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I reluctantly oppose this amend\u00ad ment. I am sympathetic to the need to prevent acquisitions which would so weaken a carrier financially that the carrier would be required to make major reductions in wages, benefits, or numbers of employees. However, I be\u00ad lieve that these acquisitions would generally fall within one of the other grounds for disapproval in our bill. In the interest of gaining widespread sup\u00ad port for the bill, which may be neces\u00ad sary in view of administration opposi\u00ad tion and the possible need to override a veto, I am urging my colleagues to keep this provision and other contro\u00ad versial provisions out of the bill. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word, and I rise in opposition to the amendment. This bill is intended to protect the public from potential adverse effects of airline leveraged buyots. It is de\u00ad signed to ensure that public safety is not undermined by huge debt levels that may be incurred to purchase an airline. We should be careful about ex\u00ad panding its scope beyond that. I recognize that employees can be adversely affected by a leveraged buyout. But I believe that their inter\u00ad est can be adequately protected by other provisions in this bill. Provisions in the bill designed to block a breakup of the carrier should minimize the impact of the acquisition on employ\u00ad ees. Moreover, a provision that would regulate the wages, benefits, and number of employees goes too far. That intrudes into areas that should clearly be left to labor-management negotiations. Any additions to the bill such as this one are bound to cause problems for this bill in the Senate and with the ex\u00ad ecutive branch. It would be unfortu\u00ad nate if we were to go to all this trouble to develop a good bill only to see it die because of the addition of this amend\u00ad ment. I recognize that the administration has stated its intention to veto this bill. However, I remain hopeful that if we present the President with a good bill, he can be convinced that it should be signed into law. But if we add con\u00ad troversial provisions such as this one, all hope for the eventual enactment of the bill would be lost. This amendment goes beyond the purpose of this bill, is overly intrusive, and is likely to add unnecessary con-troversy to the bill. Therefore, I oppose it. Mr. BOSCO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, a rather interesting phenomenon has occurred in the dis\u00ad cussion of this bill, despite the very good intentions of all who have worked on it, and it is a fine piece of legislation. However, we have gone into the realm now of fortune telling, and most of that having to do with the President's veto. The White House has made it clear that the President is against this piece of legislation. Yesterday, the House passed an amendment that I offered, presumably that will not only make the President veto the bill but perhaps lift it up, as well. Now we are being told that the gentlemen from Oregon, Mr. DEFAzIO's amendment is in the same category. So perhaps that Presi\u00ad dent will veto the bill, rip it up, and burn it, but let Members get down to the best thing is our responsibility to do for Members and that is, I think, to protect the American traveling public. Today in the Wall Street Journal Sec\u00ad retary of Transportation Skinner said that he does not need any of the powers that this bill will grant him, to protect the public from the financial disasters that will happen. He says he already has that power. Well, the question is, why has the Secretary of Transportation not, in the past, used that power? The fact is, because we have not been specific enough in giving him a direction on what criteria to use. The gentleman from Oregon, Mr. DEFAZIO's amendment is simple, and that is that we treat people in the same categories in the bill that we do assets, that we make as one criteria for the Secretary of Transportation to use in determining whether or not to ap\u00ad prove these major transactions. The one criteria should be the effect that it has on working men and women. Now, when we go to get into an air\u00ad plane and when everybody else buys his or her tickets and gets on the plane, one of the major considerations that a person makes, in addition to the safety of the aircraft, is about the per\u00ad sonnel on that airplane, from the pilot to the flight attendants to the me\u00ad chanics who have worked on it. If those people are confident, if they have a sense of purpose in their work, then it only stands to reason that the public will be treated better and that the safety of these aircraft will be im\u00ad proved. I do not think we should separate the value of assets versus the value of people. All are important in this indus\u00ad try. I think it is perfectly appropriate for the Secretary of Transportation to take both into account in making his determination. One of the sad aspects to this take\u00ad over mania we have had in the airline industry is the effect that it has had on people who work for the airlines and their families. In fact, I would be willing to venture a guess that that is the reason so many Members of Con\u00ad gress are interested in this legislation is because they have workers in their district that are being displaced by these takeovers. D 1450 We have had Members from all over the country who have heard from their constituents on the proposed American Airlines takeover. We have had many, many hundreds of pilots and flight attendants from Eastern Airlines who have been displaced, who have lost their health plans, their pen\u00ad sion benefits, because of that takeover. If it is not because of these people that this legislation is offered, then I would like to know why it is. So I think it is perfectly appropriate that Mr. DEFAZIO should offer this amendment. I support this amend\u00ad ment, and I commend it to the Mem\u00ad bers's attention and hope they will support it. Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and rise in opposition to the amendment. All this amendment does is require, in an area in which I have very deep concerns about in the bill, the Secre\u00ad tary of Transportation to do certain things, that he has no options. We say we are giving him more power and more leverage, but at the same time we are saying what he has got to do. This will require the Secretary of Transp~rtation to disapprove of an ac\u00ad quisition if in fact to salvage the com\u00ad pany they have got to dismiss person\u00ad nel. We are making it so that a company that is in trouble cannot dismiss per\u00ad sonnel under this amendment. We are making it so the company cannot sell off its assets to salvage itself. This amendment would insure bank\u00ad ruptcy as the only alternative. If that is what we want to do, then we should pass this amendment. Mr. DELAY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I do not really know whether to be for this amendment or against this amendment. If we pass this amendment, then I think this bill will be so loaded down that the Presi\u00ad dent will have to veto it. That being the case, and, since I am against the bill, maybe I should be for Mr. DEFA\u00ad zrn's amendment. But in real con\u00ad science, I have to stand up and oppose it. Members already know what this bill is all about. The bill is to protect large airlines, in particular, any takeovers of United and American. That is what generated this bill in the first place. 26828 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 Today we bring to the floor an amendment to protect big labor unions from any sort of hit in the ac\u00ad quisition of airlines. That is what this amendment is designed for. Have we forgotten that quality is not a function of whether you belong to a labor union or not? Quality of work is not a function of being a labor union. Just recently, if Members will re\u00ad member, our own Members' dining room became privitized, which I thought was a good move, but in privi\u00ad tizing we protected the employees and said you could not fire any employees. You could not alter or discuss their wages. You could not do anything. Members, did service improve in the Members dining room? Not at all. That same thing will happen here. We will not get better quality, nor safer airlines. the end result will be no acquisition, no efficiencies of scale. Nothing will happen, and we will shut down the airline industry. We might as well nationalize the airlines and let the Secretary of Transportation run them by passing this amendment. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, would the gentleman yield? Mr. DELAY. I will be glad to yield to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman read the amendment, he is familiar that it is going to do the same in terms of disposition of aircraft and other items of the airline. It says, \"major reduction in wages, benefits, or number of employees.\" It says because of the acquisition of additional debt, not a mere efficiency move, not to con\u00ad tinue operation of an airline attempt\u00ad ing to make itself profitable. When you are talking about a lever\u00ad aged buyout situation, someone going out and acquiring massive new debt and acquiring an airline with it. If the only people left to make the debt pay\u00ad ments are the employees, yes, it is di\u00ad rected at that. It is not directed at effi\u00ad ciencies. It would not tie the airline's hands. Mr. DELAY. Mr. Chairman, reclaim\u00ad ing my time, the gentleman did not read the original bill. The bill does not just address leveraged buyouts. It ad\u00ad dresses all acquisitions, all streamlin\u00ad ing, that amount to 15 percent or more in affecting the assets of an air\u00ad line. Plus the gentleman's amendment does not define what \"major\" is. What is major? Major could be to the Member maybe lowering wages by 15 percent. Maybe that is a major move as far as he is concerned. To me that is not major. But in the bill, and in this amend\u00ad ment, major is ill-defined. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DELAY. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, if we look at the others, we are leaving in this bill a great deal of discretion to the Secretary of Transportation, and my amendment purposely leaves the same amount of discretion that is left in the other section. He is to look at the selling of the assets and gates, only if it would have a major impact on the airline. Mr. DELAY. Mr. Chairman, reclaim\u00ad ing my time, we saw the same sort of thing in the deregulation of trucking. In trying to protect the workers, em\u00ad ployees and benefits of employees and their jobs, many companies went bankrupt. Many of those trucking companies that were held to certain standards in maintaining wage, bene\u00ad fits and jobs went bankrupt. I remember serving on the Commit\u00ad tee on Public Works. We had an over\u00ad sight hearing on deregulation of truck\u00ad ing. The Teamsters Union fellow testi\u00ad fied before the committee and talked about all the bankruptcies in the trucking industry. I asked him, out of all those bank\u00ad rupt companies, how many were union? Everyone of them was a union company, because there was no give or take in wages, benefits or positions in those particular companies to allow them to compete. What we are doing is putting it in law and saying there will not be any. Therefore, there will not be any, and not only do we have bankrupt airlines, we have no acquisition of airlines, good or bad. Mr. MINETA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, the important legisla\u00ad tion which we are considering today addresses many of my concerns about the leveraged buyouts of airlines and the Federal role in such LBO's. One area, however, which this fine bill does not address is the treatment of airline employees in the event of a leveraged buyout. The legislation before us requires that the Secretary of Transportation, when reviewing a proposed LBO, con\u00ad sider many conditions, including com\u00ad petitiveness, foreign control, treat\u00ad ment of assets, debt, and safety. But it does not require the Secretary to con\u00ad sider the most important factor in safety-the human factor. As we all know, many airline em\u00ad ployees have been hit especially hard by the sweeping changes in the air travel industry. The impact on em\u00ad ployees and their ability to do their jobs must be considered. In too many cases, buyers of airlines have treated airline employees as a commodity; some raiders have even squeezed employees as a resource toward paying off debts, and employ\u00ad ees at that time are vulnerable with the potential threat of no job or having to settle for a job at a reduced rate of pay. I am extremely concerned about the unfairness these employees endure, and I worry about the resulting impact on the smooth operation and safety of air carriers. Safety can be compromised not just by disgruntled workers, but by fa\u00ad tigued employees, over-worked em\u00ad ployees, worried employees. Work\u00ad place stress and harassment have no place in the air travel industry. It is not only fair but good common sense for the Secretary, in reviewing a proposed leveraged buyout, to consider the personnel component in judging the proposal. And so, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the amendment of the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I come from an area that has lost an awful lot of jobs. As a member of the Committee on Public Works I have great respect for the chairman of the committee, the ranking minority member, the subcommittee chairman. But let me tell Members something: If part of a legislation that is good for the American worker is going to cause a bill to be vetoed, then veto this sucker. And if we are not going to stand here, and I mean this, and make sure that all precautions are taken to protect the interests of the American worker, what are we doing here? D 1500 Mr. Chairman, my district is a micro\u00ad cosm of Congress' policies in this regard. This calls for any major reduc\u00ad tion. It gives tremendous discretion. Mr. Chairman, let me tell my col\u00ad leagues that a lot of these people come in, and they are buying these compa\u00ad nies out, making paper transactions, and they do not care what happens to the American worker, and let me tell my colleagues what. The American worker, who is an endangered species anymore, happens to be the American consumer. And what we have right now is people working an 8-hour-a-day jobs, busting their humps for people who are selling the company out for paper profits, losing their benefits, and they end up working for some for\u00ad eign interest. Man, we have got some problems. Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand how in God's name Congress would stand by on the threat of a veto and not look at this type of broad, vague language that at least tells the Ameri\u00ad can worker, \"Look, we know that you're going through some rough times; we're at least going to give you some token consideration,\" because we are not giving them any meat and po\u00ad tatoes. Man, we are not giving them any meat and potatoes, and we are still laughing about this. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26829 Rockefeller Center. Today Boeing is in trouble. They want to build the largest airliner in the world. They are looking for Japanese investors, and I heard Mitsubishi is coming in. What about the men and women who work at those airlines? Mr. Chairman, I am fed up with this deregulation. I ask my colleagues, \"If deregulation is so great, how come they can't find our luggage?\" Mr. Chairman, we have got the American business world in chaos. We have got management preying upon workers. We have got workers looking for politicians to bail them out. Do my colleagues know what we have in this country? We have the chapter 11 ringing its bell in the Cap\u00ad itol so loud that the bubble is going to burst right here. Look. The gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO] has come with a very modest amendment that says, \"This ain't going to do a whole lot. We give the secretary all this discretion.\" This is an insult to Congress that this will be called for a vote. It should be accepted, and that is not to deni\u00ad grate the intentions, the integrity or abilities of our chairman and ranking people. Mr. Chairman, I am for the amend\u00ad ment of the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO], and I am urging Con\u00ad gress to vote for it. At least let the American worker know that we consid\u00ad er him occasionally. My colleagues, the rice paddy on the east lawn of the White House is not too far off. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Oregon CMr. DEFAZIO] is a very valua\u00ad ble member of our subcommittee. He is diligent in attending the hearings and is a very thoughtful member of our subcommittee. He has devoted considerable time and attention to aviation issues. Indeed he did intro\u00ad duce legislation early this summer to deal with the airline financing issue and buyouts of airlines, and I want to compliment the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO], and I fully sympathize with his deep concern for working people. Mr. Chairman, it is not hard to speak on behalf of an amendment of this kind. This is easy to do. Equity for American workers, that is where I have stood all my life. However, Mr. Chairman, this bill is not the National Labor Relations Act Amendments of 1989. This bill is not the National Railway Labor Act Amendments of 1989. This legislation is to deal with a very specific, narrow\u00ad ly focused concern that we have in aviation, to deal with the buyout, the acquisitions of air carriers. Mr. Chairman, we cannot cover, I think, in legislation every specific con\u00ad cern in a direct and precise way. We did try to deal in a generic way with broad issues of public concern, of public policy concern, in a bill that was very carefully crafted. Mr. Chairman, the amendment of the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DE\u00ad FAZIO] proposes to protect wages, ben\u00ad efits and numbers of employees in an airline buyout situation, and it would require the secretary to turn down, to reject, the buyouts if any of those would be reduced for the purpose of a buyout. Now the secretary would have that authority, should he choose to use it, under the broad generic lan\u00ad guage of our bill. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield to the gen\u00ad tleman from Oregon. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, it is qualified in that it only applies to major reductions and only in such a case when they are required primarily as a result of adding costs arising from the acquisition. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFA\u00ad zi;oJ is correct. There is that qualifica\u00ad tion, but just in the same vein is the legislation crafted to require turndown of a buyout if the secretary finds that the carrier will have to dispose of a substantial portion of aviation-related assets in order to meet its financial ob\u00ad ligations. There are a number of provisions in the bill under which the secretary can and will take into consideration the impact of the buyout on the people af\u00ad fected in that airline. That is what we are trying to get at. We are trying to see that there is a carrier in place. Now, if the secretary reviews the transaction and finds that this thing is so heavily loaded with debt that the carrier is not going to be able to con\u00ad tinue to buy aircraft, meet its safety obligations, compete in this highly cutthroat business, he is going to have to turn it down. That will inure to the benefit of the workers because, if they cannot buy aircraft, if they cannot meet their safety obligations, if they cannot do all those other things be\u00ad cause they are so heavily loaded with debt that they are going to have to consider asking employees to reduce wages and benefits and to take cuts in numbers of employees, that is not going to be a good airline. The Secre\u00ad tary is going to have to turn that deal down, ask them to restructure it. Mr. Chairman, that is what we want to get at, this broad issue of how well\u00ad financed the resulting carrier is. Is it going to be able to compete? Mr. Chairman, if we have strong, competitive carriers, they will have strong employee work forces, they will have well-paid employees, they will have good benefits for their workers, and what we are trying to do is to make sure that the marketplace is ade\u00ad quate in numbers of airlines and in terms of competition in the air carrier industry and financing of those carri\u00ad ers. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not needed in this bill. We have ad\u00ad dressed this issue in the broad terms of the language of the bill itself, and the bill can stand on its own, and the Secretary can protect workers' wages, benefits, and numbers of employees under the authority of this legislation, and I urge def eat of this amendment. Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment which would add labor protection provisions to the leveraged buyout bill. The lan\u00ad guage which the gentleman has of\u00ad fered would mandate an airline acqui\u00ad sition to be disapproved if the Secre\u00ad tary found there would be a major re\u00ad duction in wages, benefits, or the number of employees. There are those who would argue that this legislation intrudes too heav\u00ad ily into the internal affairs of the cor\u00ad poration. The gentleman's amendment would force the Secretary of Trans\u00ad portation to involve himself in the de\u00ad cisionmaking of a company which clearly should be part of labor/man\u00ad agement relations. The proposal by the gentleman gets the Government into the business of trying to decide a very subjective kind of question as to what constitutes a major reduction in wages, benefits, or employees. It would put the Govern\u00ad ment in the position of being a referee between labor and management. Clearly the Government is not quali\u00ad fied to fill nor should it fill such a po\u00ad sition. Further, there may be instances where a reduction in wages or employ\u00ad ment might very well be in the public interest. The amendment as presently structured would prevent that reduc\u00ad tion occurring at all. Of course, we can envision situations where a company may be unable to operate under its current structure necessitating a reor\u00ad ganization in employment. This amendment may, in fact, encourage in\u00ad efficiency in an airline. The amendment also may have the unintended effect of jeopardizing em\u00ad ployee supported acquisitions, such as the United buyout proposal which re\u00ad cently fell apart. In the United situa\u00ad tion, one employee group endorsed wage and benefit reductions while an\u00ad other employee group opposed reduc\u00ad tions. This certainly would place the Secretary in the untenable position of disapproving a deal supported by a substantial number of employees. 0 1510 Unquestionably, this type of decision should be left for labor and manage-26830 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 ment in the collective bargaining con\u00ad text. Finally, it has been alluded to that the fact is this will invite a veto, but more importantly, in my view, it will get a veto which will not be able to be overridden, so I urge all my colleagues, certainly my colleagues on this side of the aisle, to vote against this amend\u00ad ment. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Chair\u00ad man, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the committee, I am in strong support of this amendment. This is a good, appro\u00ad priate and necessary amendment. There is nothing radical or extreme about this amendment. With this amendment, my colleague is calling on the Secretary of Transportation to consider the effect that leveraged buyouts will have on airline employ\u00ad ees. This amendment would help human\u00ad ize leveraged buyouts. Our concern for the welfare of airline employees should be just as strong as our concern for the security of airplanes, gates, and computer reservation systems. If we are going to maintain a viable air\u00ad line industry, we must agree that human capital is the most important capital of any airline. We have an opportunity with this amendment to demonstrate to our Na\u00ad tion's airline employees that we care about them as much as we care about their companies. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requi\u00ad site number of words. Mr. Chairman, I would hope that we would support the DeFazio amend\u00ad ment. I think it is very important that as we take into consideration the con\u00ad ditions under which airlines are al\u00ad lowed to be transferred from one party or another or to be merged, that we also take into consideration the people who are working for those airlines. We have got to come to understand that the corporate body in this country is more than just management and shareholders. It is also the workers. One of the things that very often makes these airlines attractive is the fact that people believe they have great potential for profit because of their workforce, because of their pilots, because of their flight attend\u00ad ants, because of the machinists, the baggage handlers. Now for people to come along and decide they want to buy this airline from Mr. Trump or Mr. Goldsmith or Mr. Icahn or Mr. Lorenzo, if they want to buy the airline, let them pay for it, but do not let them give away some\u00ad body else's vacation, somebody else's sick pay, somebody else's wages, some\u00ad body else's pay raise. If they are so rich, let them pay for it. Why should they be able to deci\u00ad mate the hours and the wages and the conditions that workers have built up over many years when those workers are not even at the table to be able to accept that or to reject that? This is not a notion of where work\u00ad ers are going to be unreasonable, to throw their jobs away. The gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO] has in his amendment that if the workers agree to these reduc\u00ad tions, they are fine, but this prevents one party from just overwhelming the workers and throwing them out. A lot of lipservice has been given today on this floor on the debate on the minimum wage of the value of American workers. Well, we have al\u00ad ready screwed the low wage earner in this country with the minimum wage a few minutes ago. Now we are talking about highly skilled people with many years of seniority, that because of bat\u00ad tles between airlines that have not proven out to give us better service, to give us better competition, to give us cheaper fares, but because of the bat\u00ad tles so that people can put their names on the tails of airplanes, we are now telling these people that they simply have to be victims of that economic cannibalism. That cannot be the policy of this country. That cannot be the policy of this Congress. We have got to protect these people. These people are part of the corpora\u00ad tion that made up this airline, which\u00ad ever airline it is. They are the ones who are promoting the passenger serv\u00ad ice. They are the ones who brought the passengers there. Fortunately, we still have a little time left where we can pick and choose between airlines, so if the workforce is not cooperative, you can take airline B. When these people get done, you will not be able to do that, and at the same time they get to deci\u00ad mate the workers. You know, for Members of Congress who almost every weekend go out and get on an airplane and fly across this country or to the middle of this coun\u00ad try or up and down the east coast, for us to suggest that we can do this to the American workers, the people who we rely on to keep these planes safe, to keep them in working order, to keep them on time, to make our little ac\u00ad commodations when we are running a little late to National Airport or we are running a little behind, coming from a town meeting and we pick up the phone and say, \"This is Congress\u00ad man so-and-so. I'm on my way. Could you hold the plane?\" All those things we ask. Now you are telling the very same people that they do not count. You cannot be that hypocritical in this body. At least put them in the equa\u00ad tion so that they can be considered and their rights can be protected. Mr. JONES of Georgia. Mr. Chair\u00ad man, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the DeFazio amendment. I commend my colleague for his work in crafting this amendment and in bring\u00ad ing this amendment to the floor. I would also like to commend the distin\u00ad guished chairman of the Aviation Sub\u00ad committee, Mr. 0BERSTAR, for bringing this important legislation to the fore\u00ad front of our legislative agenda. But I believe that this amendment strength\u00ad ens the bill by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to look at the impact a takeover will have on the human capital of an airline. As we heard in committee hearings, the record is clear that, when acquisitions are highly leveraged, two things are most likely to occur to offset the in\u00ad creased debt-the disposal of physical assets and a reduction in the work\u00ad force and/or in wages and benefits. Employment policies regarding work\u00ad ing conditions and compensation have a tremendous effect on that carrier's ability to maintain established safety standards. This bill already includes provisions to protect aviation-related assets from sale by quick-buck artists. This bill should also reflect our under\u00ad standing that employment policies can impact safety by destroying morale and failing to provide sound working conditions. This amendment regards the employee as an essential compo\u00ad nent in maintaining a safe, competi\u00ad tive airline. Besides the safety considerations, should we not also safeguard the air\u00ad lines most valuable resource, its people, from raiders who consider a man's contribution to the success of an airline as nothing more than num\u00ad bers on a page in a bottom-line analy\u00ad sis? There are more than 480,000 people who work in the U.S. airline in\u00ad dustry, and their input is worth as much consideration as the planes, gates, and maintenance facilities. Taking control of an airline is not the same thing as spinning the Wheel of Fortune. It is certainly not a game to the people who work in the industry. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment, and I urge my col\u00ad leagues to support it and pass it. D 1520 Mr. PERKINS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, distinguished col\u00ad leagues, my good friends, the chair\u00ad man, subcommittee chairman on the Committee on Public Works and Transportation and, of course, on the other side, I commend everyone on the piece of legislation that they brought for this body. I certainly think they have done some wonderful things with November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26831 what they are dealing with in moving this in the right direction. I would like to comment briefly upon the amendment that is before us today that the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO] has presented to us. Certainly I think that the gen\u00ad tleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO] has attempted to equate what we are dealing with in terms of the issues to the human side as well. The people we are having in the air\u00ad line industry are certainly as impor\u00ad tant as those physical things that we have to deal with. I think it is terribly important that if we are going to pass this legislation that we try to make sure that the people who are affected at the airlines are not going to lose their jobs, are not going to take all sorts of negative revisions in pay scale that are disadvantageous to them. When one reads this amendment language, it is really relatively simple, that the acquisition would result in a major reduction in wages, benefits, or number of employees of the air carrier which is not agreed to by the employ\u00ad ees and is required primarily as a result of the added cost arising out of the acquisition. All we are asking in this particular legislation and this particular amend\u00ad ment is that if the employees do not agree to a takeover in a leveraged buyout, simply that the Secretary con\u00ad sider what will happen to them as something of importance. I think it is important that we take the employees into consideration when this type of situation comes up. It is not right for the leveraged buyouts that occur to occur on the backs of the employees of this coun\u00ad try. I think that is wrong. Indeed, if we are going to have leveraged buyouts, let us try to take the employ\u00ad ee out of that equation. Let us try to say that we are going to give them a certain measure of protection from all the buyouts that go across this coun\u00ad try. It is all right if they want to do the buyout, but do not make the employ\u00ad ees suffer. That is all this amendment says. That is all this amendment does. I think we should stand and support this amendment, because it is an aid to the American laborer. It does some\u00ad thing that is positive. It helps people and, indeed, it humanizes a system that could sorely use some humanity. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentle\u00ad man from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO]. The question was taken; and the chairman announced that the noes ap\u00ad peared to have it. RECORDED VOTE Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered.

The result of the vote was an\u00ad nounced as above recorded. Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in sup\u00ad port of the DeFazio amendment. Yesterday, I declared my support for another amendment to this bill, an amendment which if adopted and passed, would require the Transportation Secretary Skinner to refuse any acquisition when a would-be buyer, who already controls one airline, has shown a history of filing more than one chapter 11 bankruptcy. What we are all concerned about here is the health and fitness of our Nation's airlines. Thus far, however, we have talked only about 26832 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 the physical and the fiscal aspects of our air\u00ad lines. In our discussion we have not, however, fo\u00ad cused on the most valuable asset of our air\u00ad lines-the thousands of devoted and hard working men and women who work for the air\u00ad lines. We must consider the impact of these leveraged buyouts or acquisitions on the in\u00ad dustry's labor force in addition to the impact on the physical assets. This amendment con\u00ad siders those folks who so rightly deserve our concern. Surely we all are aware of the number of mergers and acquisitions that have taken place in the airline industry in recent years. The acquisition of Eastern Air Lines by the Texas Air Corp., and the subsequent chapter 11 filing, should provide us with ample illustra\u00ad tion of the need for heightened scrutiny of buyouts. Eastern's labor force has been deci\u00ad mated. Allow me to illustrate my point. Since Texas Air Corp. purchased Eastern in 1986, the ad\u00ad versarial position of labor and management has worsened, causing an atmosphere of anx\u00ad iety among many Eastern employees. During hearings my subcommittee held in 1987 and 1988, I heard from a score of pilots, flight at\u00ad tendants, mechanics, and other Eastern per\u00ad sonnel who were legitimately concerned about their futures with the company. For example, in October 1987, the IAM and Eastern began negotiations on the renewal terms of their col\u00ad lective bargaining agreement. Management asked for pay cuts of 30 to 40 percent in return for a job retraining program which would enable baggage handlers to become mechanics whom Eastern subsequently might hire at the then prevailing mechanic pay scale. Eastern later moderated its demand, offering a 20 to 28 percent wage cut, coupled with a 4-year wage freeze. The IAM voted over\u00ad whelmingly to reject this offer. Meanwhile, Texas Air Corp. was devising a rather cynical strike contingency plan, which would essentially create a scab airline. In oversight hearings held on this matter, my subcommittee learned that Eastern contracted with a little-known cargo carrier called Orion Air to lease and fly some of its airplanes should Eastern's pilots support the IAM in a future strike. Rather than delaying operations until replacement flight crews were trained, this arrangement would have permitted the carrier to operate without interruption. Ultimately, the situation was resolved by a preliminary injunction issued by District Court Judge Barrington Parker who ruled that East\u00ad ern airplanes could not be flown by Orion pilots or any pilots not in the Eastern seniority list. Judge Parker also ruled that Eastern had to maintain the status quo until a hearing was held to address the complaints of the Airline Pilots Association [ALPA] ALPA has other cases before Judge Parker regarding the transfer of Eastern assets. They claim these transfers are intended to under\u00ad mine Eastern's unions as well as Eastern by taking away from the union operation and giving it to a nonunion entity. That argument may indeed have merit. At the same time Eastern was attempting to cut wages, it was selling its computer reservation system-an airlines' most valuable asset-to its parent company, Texas Air. Eastern must now pay about $120 million a year plus a $1.85 per passenger booking fee to the new subsidiary. The point here is that the wheeling and dealing of the \"big boys\" (e.g., Frank Lorenzo and Carl Icahn) creates an uneven playing field, that puts hundreds of jobs in peril. To expect that these situations can be fairly re\u00ad solved at the bargaining table is, I think, naive. We must protect the workers. Mr. Chairman, there was a time when airline industry employees could work in a relatively secure, regulated environment that they once enjoyed. It would appear that the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 put an end to that. I seriously doubt that we anticipat\u00ad ed that effect. Deregulation fostered a com\u00ad petitive environment. It created a Pac Man syndrome of larger carriers devouring their smaller competitors. In that atmosphere of the restructuring of the airline industry employees have been left exposed and unprotected. In an environment in which carriers have felt the necessity to trim down to a leaner operating condition, downsizing has become a necessi\u00ad ty. Too often we have witnessed layoffs, de\u00ad motions, and transfers, as well as the integra\u00ad tion of seniority rosters, work-rule practices, and wage schedules. Before its demise, the Civil Aeronautics Board routinely imposed labor protective pro\u00ad visions to deal with these side effects/byprod\u00ad ucts of mergers, route sales, asset transfers, and similar transactions. These labor protec\u00ad tive provisions would typically include dis\u00ad placement, dismissal, relocation allowances; severance pay; continuation of benefits, the integration of seniority lists, and wage sched\u00ad ules. Passage of the Airline Dregulation Act marked the beginning of the end for these labor protection practices. The Government has played a more limited role in the airline in\u00ad dustry, preferring instead to protect airline em\u00ad ployees from the effect of mergers via the col\u00ad lective bargaining conducted by the con\u00ad cerned parties. Since adopting this position, the Department of Transportation has not conditioned approval of any merger or similar transaction on the acceptance of Govern\u00ad ment-imposed labor protective provisions. Perhaps some will view the amendment as an attempt to regulate the industry. I do not view it in that way. Rather, I urge you to think of it as the least we can do to protect and show our support for the thousands of men and women who have dedicated many years of service to building and ensuring a safe, secure, comfortable, and reliable airline indus\u00ad try. PERSONAL EXPLANATION Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, on roll call 325 I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present I would have voted \"aye\" in favor of the DeFazio amend\u00ad ment. length before as we have debated this bill. One of the major flaws of this piece of legislation, in my judgment, is that it mandates the Secretary of Transportation as to what he must do. Yesterday in our debate on this piece of legislation the author of the legislation, the chairman of the sub\u00ad committee, whom I am privileged to work with and certainly respect, made the comment and statement that it is important for the Secretary to have an opportunity to see and to review a buyout proposal before it takes effect. I agree with that. That would be very good. But it does not give the Secre\u00ad tary, then, the latitude and the oppor\u00ad tunity to make a decision as to wheth\u00ad er the buyout is a worthy buyout or not. He is mandated under the terms of this legislation to make a decision if certain findings are found. The chairman also indicated and stated today that he wants a bill that will keep the few airlines that we now have, which incidentally is eight, eight American airlines, to keep them in ex\u00ad istence, and certainly this bill will do that. It will truly protect those that are now in existence. But it will, at the same time, prevent any new airlines from being formed. Thus, in my judg\u00ad ment, it will significantly stifle compe\u00ad tition in the future. It will protect those that exist be\u00ad cause it will not permit anyone to sell off or create new airlines and certainly no new airlines, without spinning off existing airlines, will be able to come in and begin. So to me it is re-regulation, even though we do not regulate routes, we do not regulate rates, and we do not regulate hubs. But it does regulate who can continue to operate as an air\u00ad line and who cannot. Essentially it closes out all future competition, and the eight that now exist will be without competition. They have already worked out an agreement where they each have their own hub, where they each have their own routes, and they pretty well work on the rates. So regulation is the end result whether it be by government regulation or by the private sector. We in this legislation are simply locking those eight into existence in perpetuity and not allowing any new airlines to form. That is an anticompetitive bill, in my judgment. The thing I object to the most and what my amendment does is that the bill, in the bill itself, I read, \"The Sec\u00ad retary of Transportation shall disap- AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR.

Mr. Chairman, we fore they are redundant and unneces\u00ad have discussed this matter at some sary. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26833 But it does require the Secretary of Transportation to reject a takeover or a buyout if it would require the air\u00ad line, or if it is the intent of an airline, the purchasing airline, to sell off assets. With the amendment that just passed, where you cannot reduce per\u00ad sonnel, you cannot reduce personnel's benefits or wages, and you cannot sell off assets, how does a troubled airline survive, where can it go to be able to remain in business? We have guaranteed by the amend\u00ad ments that have now passed and by the language of this bill, we have guar\u00ad anteed bankruptcy for a troubled air\u00ad line with no opportunity to work themselves out of it through a buyout process. This amendment would simply give the Secretary of Transportation, truly give him discretion rather than token discretion, by saying, \"You must review the case,\" the buyout propos\u00ad als, \"but if you find certain things, you must deny the buyout proposal.\" That is not discretion. I would sug\u00ad gest this would allow this bill to sur\u00ad vive. There is no way it will survive the process and get the President's signa\u00ad ture with the amendments as they are now existent unless we are able to give the Secretary of Transportation some discretion in determining whether a buyout is a good proposal or a poor proposal. D 1550 Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. PACKARD. I yield to the gen\u00ad tleman from Minnesota. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman said, where does a troubled airline go for financial help if it cannot reduce wages, benefits, and number of employees, and certainly, the Secretary would have the author\u00ad ity under our bill without the last amendment that the Committee of the Whole just approved, to look at those issues. However, I want to say to the gentleman that it is not the trou\u00ad bled airlines that are the subject of ac\u00ad quisition. An existing carrier can reduce the wages and benefits without having Secretarial approval. Under the amendment just adopted, which I opposed, the only condition for a situ\u00ad ation in which wages, benefits, and number of employees would be the subject of review of the Secretary would be in an acquisition. If an exist\u00ad ing carrier wanted, or the manage\u00ad ment of an existing carrier felt that it is necessary to reduce wages and bene\u00ad fits and number of employees, they could negotiate that with their work\u00ad ers or take whatever other action is necessary without Secretarial review.

It is also de\u00ad signed to stop transactions that would result in a foreigner taking control of the airline. In such situations, the DOT Secretary would be required to disapprove the transaction. This amendment would undermine the purposes of this bill by allowing the Secretary to approve transactions that would have the sort of negative effects I just described. Under this amendment, a transaction that would lead to a deterioration in safety could be approved. The Secretary would have the discretion to do that. Now I do not believe that a Secre\u00ad tary of Transportation would allow such a safety problem. But I see no reason to give him such discretion here. It is important that this bill reas\u00ad sure the public that we will not allow leveraged buyouts that will lead to a deterioration in safety in any case. To the extent that the Secretary needs additional discretion, it has al\u00ad ready been provided by the amend\u00ad ment that I offered, and that was ap-I urge a \"no\" vote. Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words and I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment which would make the Secretary's authority to dis\u00ad approve an airline acquisition discre\u00ad tionary rather than mandatory. The gentleman has argued that the Secretary does not have sufficient dis\u00ad cretion in deciding whether or not to permit an airline acquisition to go for\u00ad ward. I disagree with the gentleman's analysis of the legislation. According to the provisions in the bill, the Secretary is directed to disap\u00ad prove a buyout if the Secretary finds that it would weaken the carrier finan\u00ad cially so as to substantially impair its ability to operate safely or its ability to compete effectively. Also, in certain cases in the downsizing of a carrier's size could trigger a disapproval. If the Secretary makes the finding that there is no adverse effect on the carrier then the acquisition could take place. This process provides ample dis\u00ad cretion to permit these buyouts to go forward if they are in the public inter\u00ad est. There is no requirement in the 26834 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 legislation that all buyouts be disap\u00ad proved. As I have mentioned, one factor trig\u00ad gering disapproval involves the inabil\u00ad ity of a carrier to operate safely. In my opinion it would be ill advised for Con\u00ad gress to provide discretionary author\u00ad ity to the Secretary to approve an ac\u00ad quisition if he made the finding that safety would be adversely effected. It seems to me that the best approach is to prohibit the transaction from occur\u00ad ring if safety is at risk. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate an important protec\u00ad tion from the bill and I urge my col\u00ad leagues to vote against it. 0 1600 Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I join in expressing respect and admiration for the gentleman from California [Mr. PACKARD], my col\u00ad league on this committee and the author of this amendment, who has contributed greatly to the work of this committee, and is a very thoughtful and constructive member. But in the gentleman's former profession, before being elected to Congress, the gentle\u00ad man was a dentist. He knows how to pull teeth. What the gentleman would do with this amendment is to pull the teeth of the bill. I would hope that we would not have a dental operation here this afternoon, because we need some spe\u00ad cific, targeted, directive authority to the Secretary as we have put in this bill to require certain actions at cer\u00ad tain times. I think as Chairman ANDERSON said earlier in debate, maybe some Secre\u00ad taries would come along and not use the discretionary authority. I think as the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, to substitute \"may\" for \"shall\" provides too much discretion. We are trying to narrow down, and fine tune the authority of the Secre\u00ad tary to remove the mandatory feature of this legislation would make it virtu\u00ad ally worthless. We would not be pro\u00ad tecting anything. Mr. Chairman, for that reason I oppose the amendment and urge Mem\u00ad bers to vote against the amendment, which strikes at the heart of this bill. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chair\u00ad man, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I rise in strong oppo\u00ad sition to H.R. 3443. Does Government tinkering in the marketplace, does bureaucratic regula\u00ad tion or Federal intervention bolster enterprise, growth, and expansion in America? No way. Do congressional at\u00ad tempts to stablize Wall Street and pro\u00ad tect the corporate establishment hurt our economy? Absolutely. In fact, it is probably true to say that most of the stock market's recent erratic behavior stems from fear of Government action and not from the economic condition of the country. Mr. Chairman, the 1980's have been the decade of marketpower over state power. As a result, our people have en\u00ad joyed unprecedented economic growth and prosperity. The message of the 1980's is simple-government regula\u00ad tion and interference, whether in the U.S.A. or the U.S.S.R., does not work. Freedom and competition work. Yes, some do not fare well in an en\u00ad vironment of enterprise and competi\u00ad tion. Management teams that cannot manage, corporate executives who cannot lead or make decisions are left behind-as they should be. Companies that overdiverify or work nowhere near their potential come under in\u00ad creasing pressure-as they should. Contrary to all the whining from complacent management, the pressure on corporate owners and managers has been a boon to our economy. As econo\u00ad mist Robert J. Samuelson recently wrote, \"Even the distant threat of an unwanted takeover prompts compa\u00ad nies to streamline.\" Why is Congress afraid of that? Why are we trying to protect incompetent management, overbloated executives, and poor in\u00ad vestment decisions. Let's quit listening to the whining and start hearing the hum of competitive industry, and new investment-which is the byproduct of investment freedom in this country. The fact is that the appropriate management structure for an airline or any business is best determined in the marketplace and not in the Halls of Congress or the office of the Secre\u00ad tary of Transportation. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3443 would give the Department of Transportation new authority to disapprove transac\u00ad tions involving air carriers, would pro\u00ad vide new bases for rejecting transac\u00ad tions, and would require carriers to wait as long as 50 days before consu\u00ad mating transactions. And this legisla\u00ad tion goes even further. H.R. 3443 would in effect stop all airline acquisitions-whether lever\u00ad aged buyouts, straight cash purchases, or any other kind-good and bad alike. Allegedly designed to protect the safety of air carriers, the bill will, in time, bring down a premier American industry-protecting it into stagna\u00ad tion, mediocrity, and complacency. Nothing could be worse for the air\u00ad lines than isolating their management from the marketplace. Nothing could be worse for our economy with this kind of precedent. Mr. Chairman, this bill is more ap\u00ad propriate for the Soviet airline, Aero\u00ad flot-not the American airline indus\u00ad try. Why are we here today sending this kind of signal to the investment world. Why are we considering legislation that will turn a gleaming competitive American industry into a rusting hulk? This bill is nothing more than pro\u00ad tection for special interests and the privileged, protection of entrenched management and inefficiency. As a recent article from Policy Review mag\u00ad azine concluded, \"Public policy should not be in the business of protecting corporate executives at the expense of their companies' shareholders and cus\u00ad tomers.\" For example, during a Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing: Japanese management puts new technology to work more effi\u00ad ciently. Mr. Chairman, this bill is opposed by the Secretary of Transportation. It is opposed by the President of the United States. It is also opposed by the financial community. I urge my colleagues to defeat this economy de\u00ad stroying legislation. Let us continue the free enterprise policies of the 1980's so we can have economic growth in the 1990's. I insert the following article for the RECORD. [From Policy Review magazine] IN PRAISE OF CORPORATE RAIDERS-JUNKING THREE FALLACIES ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS <By Amar Bhide) Many leading businessmen would agree with Peter Drucker that corporate raiders threaten the legitimacy of free enterprise and that \"hostile takeovers are exceedingly bad for the economy.\" A study I conducted of all 47 contested tender offers of over $100 million in 1985 and 1986 suggests otherwise. Hostile takeov\u00ad ers are in fact an example of capitalism at its best. The typical raider breaks up un\u00ad wieldy conglomerates into their more sensi\u00ad ble constituent businesses-without sacrific\u00ad ing the long term, firing good managers, or inflicting great pain on rank-and-file em\u00ad ployees. DISMANTLING CONGLOMERATES Acquiring large diversified companies and selling off their constituent units has en\u00ad abled corporate raiders to accomplish what must be any reasonable entrepreneur's goal-to make a large profit in a short time with little risk. Consider Ronald Perelman's acquisition of Revlon. Once the undisputed leader in the cosmetics industry, Revlon had, since the death of its founder in 1975, used the cash flow from its core business to fund acquisi\u00ad tions in health care. Following a contested tender offer, Perelman acquired the firm for $1.8 billion in 1985, and within six months sold off five health care units for nearly $2 billion. The raider gained a $200 million cash profit as well as ownership of Revlon's core cosmetics business, worth about $700 million. He thus proved that the company was more valuable broken into its constitu\u00ad ent parts. Irwin Jacobs pulled off much the same trick in his hostile takeover of AMF, a con\u00ad glomerate whose holdings ranged from bowling alleys to electric relays and tire equipment to liquid filtration products. Jacobs won control in the fall of 1985 and by May of the following year recovered his entire purchase price of $560 million by sell\u00ad ing off eight of AMF's units, keeping the company's boat, sporting goods and energy operations as a reward for his pains. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26835 This pattern of buying diversified compa\u00ad nies and selling off constituent businesses is found in a majority of hostile takeovers. Three-fifths of all contested tender offers undertaken in 1985 and 1986 were followed by significant divestitures. In those offers made by independent raiders, excluding hos\u00ad tile attempts by mainstream companies, the proportion of bust-ups rises to over 80 per\u00ad cent. The attractions of a bust-up takeover from a raider's point of view are obvious: The enterprise can attract capital as a result of the raider's deal-making abilities, but does not require operating skills and ex- . perience, which is usually not his strongest suit. The payback to raiders is quick, and the economics of a bust-up can be estimated without recourse to the target's internal data, which are unavailable in an unfriendly transaction. But what of the public interest? Critics' claims that bust-ups destroy valuable syner\u00ad gies do not appear consistent with the facts. In the overwhelming majority of divesti\u00ad tures that followed the hostile takeovers of 1985-1986, the units separated served dis\u00ad tinct markets with distinct products, making the loss of economies of scope or scale un\u00ad likely. Indeed, the speed with which most divesti\u00ad tures were accomplished-usually within 18 months of the takeover-suggests that the linkages between the separated businesses were probably not great. It seems unlikely that the units could have been acceptably parceled off to buyers if there were exten\u00ad sive sharing of facilities or coordination of sales. Further, the overwhelming majority of businesses put on the block after a contest\u00ad ed takeover had themselves been acquired by the raider's target. As Michael Porter and other researchers have shown, corpora\u00ad tions generally do such a poor job of inte\u00ad grating the businesses they acquire into their existing operations that most are eventually divested. Raiders do not destroy synergies. They merely telescope into a short period the divestitures that would have taken place in the normal course of events. In addition, my research shows that raid\u00ad ers bring much greater focus to the enter\u00ad prises they split up. In 31 percent of the spin-offs that fol\u00ad lowed the 1985-1986 hostile takeovers, the buyers were investment groups or the unit's managers who intended to operate the busi\u00ad ness as a stand-alone entity. In 41 percent of the divestitures, the buyers were single-business companies in the same <or closely related> industry as the divested unit. In the remaining 28 percent of the cases, the buyers were companies that were fol\u00ad lowing diversification strategies similar to those undertaken by the targets being split up. And, it is interesting to note, within the next year and a half, a third of these buyers-including Goodyear, Bell and Howell, and Harcourt, Brace, and Jovano\u00ad vich-were themselves being courted by un\u00ad welcome suitors. We need not belabor the advantages of fo\u00ad cused, single-business firms here-the ineffi\u00ad ciencies of unrelated diversification is as close to a settled issue there is in the field of management. Almost every known a1 .i.ly\u00ad sis-from Tom Peters and Robert Warter\u00ad man's case studies of \"excellent companies,\" to D. Ravenscraft and Frederick Scherer's statistics on the post-merger performance of 5,000 acquisitions, to Michael Porter's survey of the acquisition record of blue-chip companies over a 36-year period-points to the general superiority of firms that stick to their knitting over those that diversify through acquisitions. THE ROLE OF JUNK BONDS The importance of junk-bond financing in helping raiders dismantle overly diversified corporations should not be underestimated. Until junk-bond financing became avail\u00ad able for takeovers in 1984, significant acqui\u00ad sitions could be undertaken only by profes\u00ad sional managers of established companies that could raise debt or equity financing in their own names. Consequently, diversifica\u00ad tion into unrelated businesses was an impor\u00ad tant objective in most takeovers, as it ex\u00ad panded the size of the managerial empire while reducing its vulnerability to the mis\u00ad fortunes of any one business. Corporate eti\u00ad quette discouraged bust-up takeovers, how\u00ad ever, so professional managers had little in\u00ad centive to reduce the size of their peers' cor\u00ad porations. Around 1984, the junk-bond market al\u00ad lowed entrepreneurs and deal-makers to play the takeover game. A Ronald Perelman or an Irwin Jacobs could finance takeovers through thinly capitalized partnerships or shell companies because junk-bond inves\u00ad tors were willing to provide funds backed by the targets' assets. MYTH OF UNDERVALUATION Junk-bond financing has not only made the bust-up takeover possible, it has also re\u00ad strained raiders from undertaking acquisi\u00ad tions, out of hubris or recklessness, that do not have demonstrable economic merit. Consequently, hostile takeovers have not produced the dire consequences that critics claim they do. One common myth is that hostile takeov\u00ad ers displace managers of well-run companies whose stocks happen to be temporarily mis\u00ad valued by an irrational stock market. In ac\u00ad tuality, the targets of hostile takeovers are not particularly cheap. On average, contested tender offers in 1985-86 were made at nearly three times the targets' long-run price-earnings ratio, over two times book value, and at a 40 percent premium to the lowest price reached in the year before the bid was made. Value Line, one of the rare stock-picking services that appears to consistently outperform the market, had deemed only 7 percent of all target stocks to be an attractive purchase shortly before takeover bids were made. Nor were most of the targets stellar per\u00ad formers-70 percent of them had signifi\u00ad cantly lower five-year returns on equity than comparable firms. According to re\u00ad spondents in a Fortune survey, four-fifths had below-average management. There is a good reason why raiders don't pick on good companies with temporarily depressed stocks. Junk-bond investors wouldn't finance raiders just to pick under\u00ad valued stocks for them; besides, it is unrea\u00ad sonable to expect to buy an entire company at throwaway price after paying an acquisi\u00ad tion premium and incurring considerable legal expenses. MYTH OF INVESTMENT CUTBACKS A second myth about hostile takeovers is that the long term is sacrificed for short\u00ad term profits-raiders have to cut back spending on capital equipment, research and development, and new product develop\u00ad ment in order to meet onerous interest pay\u00ad ments. This criticism, to, has little basis in logic or fact. Only a fifth of the firms that were targets of hostile takeovers in 1985 and 1986 showed any investment cutback-in capital outlays, R&D, or advertising. Furthermore, in only three cases did the evidence suggest that investment cutbacks Were induced by takeover attempts; in all other cases, the cuts were consistent with industry experience and would probably have occurred with or without a tender offer. For example, Unocal and Phillips Pe\u00ad troleum did reduce exploration expendi\u00ad tures after they were attacked by T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn, but their cuts were of the same magnitude as those implement\u00ad ed by other firms in the oil industry. Significant investment cuts due to hostile takeovers are unlikely because raiders pick on mature, low-growth firms. More than four-fifths of all targets in 1985 and 1986, for example, had chronically reinvested fewer funds in their operations than they generated. Only a fifth reported any R&D spending at all. Raiders could not easily make a case to their investors for acquiring high-growth, high-investment businesses even if they wanted to. Growth firms are difficult to value because their stock prices are heavily weighted by profits that may be realized in the very distant future. Besides, the value of such firms is often tied to the motivation of a few key employees, which may be jeop\u00ad ardized in a hostile takeover. In fact, high\u00ad growth firms are much more likely to be swallowed by corporations that wish to di\u00ad versify into a fashionable industry and for whom price is no object. Nor can one sustain the argument that raiders are forced to slash investment be\u00ad cause of the heavy debt burden they incur. Junk-bond financing in hostile takeovers is used as short-term bridge financing that is paid off as quickly as the individual busi\u00ad nesses of the target are sold off-a course followed in all but three junk-financed take\u00ad overs in 1985 and 1986. Unlike investors in a leveraged buyout, investors in a takeover need to be convinced they will be paid off quickly; they usually have been. ON WORKERS' BACKS? A third myth that raiders' profits are achieved at the expense of the targets' em\u00ad ployees, appears on the surface to have some basis. I did find evidence of layoffs, plant closings, and other \"redistributive\" ef\u00ad fects following about two-thirds of hostile takeovers in 1985 and 1986. And altogether different picture emerges, however, when the circumstances and extent of the apparent penalties imposed on target employees are examined. First, large companies in the United States began reducing jobs about two to three years before raiders became a serious threat. Thanks to a severe recession in 1982 and a rising dollar, employment in Fortune 500 companies fell by 6 percent from 1981 to 1986. Companies such as AT&T, Exxon, and General Electric shed tens of thousands of jobs in the absence of any takeover threat. Like other large firms, targets had been shrinking their payrolls-on average by 7 percent between 1981 and 1985-before they came under attack. Second, in about half of the cases where layoffs followed the takeover attempt, the evidence suggests that employment would have continued to decline with or without a change in control, because the targets and the industries they belonged to were facing severe profitability problems that bore no relation to the activities of the raiders. 26836 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 D 1610 CBS, for example, was being squeezed (along with ABC and NBC) between rising costs and declining viewership and revenues. Uniroyal was suffering, along with other U.S. manufacturers, from excess capacity and foreign competition. The breakdown of pricing discipline within OPEC was hurting Unocal and Phillips and everbody else in the oil industry. Targets and non-targets alike in these in\u00ad dustries were responding to adversity by cutting employment and capacity in 1986 and 1987. Exxon, for example, which has never faced the hint of a takeover threat, instituted a sweeping early-retirement pro\u00ad gram, while many private wildcatters shut down operations altogether. The link be\u00ad tween hostile takeover attempts and job losses in companies like Unocal, Phillips Pe\u00ad troleum, Crown Zellerbach, and Uniroyal therefore seems tenuous. In nine targets, an argument may be made that job losses arose out of <rather than fol\u00ad lowed> takeovers, but their magnitude bor\u00ad ders on the trivial. In almost every case, the terminations involved a relatively small number-about a few hundred per target\u00ad of corporate and administrative staffs rather than the more numerous line or pro\u00ad duction employees. The absence of extensive job cuts, too, is not a happenstance. Raiders are not in the rescue business, and do not seek to turn around troubled companies by cutting costs or wages. Assessing the probability of suc\u00ad cess of rescuing distressed firms is a risky proposition under any circumstances-rescu\u00ad ers usually find problems they had not ini\u00ad tially anticipated. Attempting a turnaround through a hostile transaction, where the raider does not have access to the target's books, would be an extraordinary gamble. Furthermore, the average raider does not have the operating experience necessary to convince investors of his ability to pull off a rescue. POLICY IMPLICATIONS Although raiders have completely restruc\u00ad tured several targets, their overall impact has not been great. The bust-up takeover re\u00ad mains a perilous, expensive exercise that only a handful of raiders have the compe\u00ad tence and credibility to undertake. And while some diversified corporations have sold unrelated businesses in order to pre\u00ad empt hosUle takeovers, the much-heralded divestiture wave is not significant in historic terms. Meanwhile, the flood of friendly di\u00ad versifying mergers proceeds unabated-the Kodaks continue swallowing the Sterling Drugs and the Philip Morrises continue ac\u00ad quiring the Krafts. Whatever small influence raiders have had on managers may well decline in the future if current trends in public policy on takeovers persist. Astute lobbying by corpo\u00ad rate-level executives-the only group ad\u00ad versely affected by raiders-is putting the squeeze on bust-ups. The state of New Jersey, for example, has passed a law that prohibits raiders from selling assets to pay back debt incurred in takeovers. Critics of hostile takeovers, for example Lloyd Cutler, have also called for federal legislation to limit the interest de\u00ad duction for debt used in takeovers. And there have been suggestions that the owner\u00ad ship rights of \"new\" shareholders be re\u00ad stricted so that raiders would find it diffi\u00ad cult to gain control of target companies. This trend, the record shows, runs counter to the needs of a healthy and dynamic in\u00ad dustry structure. Public policy should not be in the business of protecting corporate executives at the expense of their compa\u00ad nies' shareholders and customers. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentle\u00ad man from California [Mr. PACKARD]. The amendment was rejected. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. PACKARD Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, I off er an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. PACKARD: Page 4, strike lines 14 through 24. Page 5, line 1, strike \"(3)\" and insert \"(2)\". Page 5, line 4, strike \"(4)\" and insert \"(3)\". Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, the argument was given on the last amendment that giving the Secretary of Transportation discretion would weaken the safety features of this piece of legislation. That is a very dif\u00ad ficult argument to debate against, be\u00ad cause none of us are interested in weakening the safety of our airlines. I am persuaded, however, that the Secretary of Transportation would never approve of an acquisition, even having the discretion to do so, that would compromise safety in our air\u00ad lines. Be that as it may, in an effort to protect the safety mandates of this piece of legislation, which brought about most of the arguments against the last amendment, this second amendment is to allow those provi\u00ad sions to remain intact within the piece of legislation, but to strike those provi\u00ad sions that would mandate the Secre\u00ad tary from disapproving an acquisition if an airline were to down size or sell off assets. This is all this amendment would do, is keep the safety features in this piece of legislation, delete those f ea\u00ad tures where the Secretary would be under requirement and shall disap\u00ad prove of an acquisition based upon the desires of an acquired airline to down size or to sell off assets. That is all this does. I believe this is a good amendment. I did not call for a record vote on the last amendment. I intend to do so here because I believe this will clean it up, but still preserve the safety features, of which we heard a great deal about on the last amendment. Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I oppose the amendment. The provi\u00ad sion which this amendment would strike requires diapproval of an acqui\u00ad sition if the intent of the acquiring party is to make a major reduction in the size of the air carrier. The report\u00ad ed bill would permit the Secretary to approve an acquisition of this nature if there would be ovuriding public benefits. However, if there are no overriding public benefits, there is no reason to allow a corporate raider to come in and dismantle an air carrier. Accordingly, I urge defeat of this amendment. Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment which would strike from the legislation authority to disapprove an acquisition if such acquisition would lead to a major reduction in the size of a carrier. I agree with the gen\u00ad tleman that there may be situations where a reduction in the size of a car\u00ad rier could improve competition or the company's economic health. However, an amendment which we adopted in committee eliminates any potential problems by providing the Secretary with sufficient flexibility to permit downsizing to occur if the Sec\u00ad retary finds that it would be in the public interest. This is a very broad ex\u00ad ception to the general rule and gives the Secretary ample flexibility to ap\u00ad prove the reduction in size which may be necessary for safety or efficiency. The gentleman's amendment would strip away one of the important pro\u00ad tections in this legislation. The pur\u00ad pose of this bill is to give the Secre\u00ad tary authority to review airline acqui\u00ad sitions which may result in the dis\u00ad mantlement of companies purely for profit reasons. Given the small number of remaining air carriers, we should not foster continued concentra\u00ad tion of the industry by permitting cor\u00ad porate raiders to sell off assets of com\u00ad panies which provide important public benefits. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. CLINGER. I yield to the gentle\u00ad man from California. Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, the provisions that we are striking from the bill in this amendment would be those that are not hostile takeovers, those that are the reputable airlines that are operating without normal buyout opportunities and proposals and would generally not fall in the category of the distressed or the trou\u00ad bled airlines. It is not true that normal selling off and buying of assets is a natural and normal process within the business in the corporate world today? Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, I would certainly agree. The only addi\u00ad tion I would make is, as we have argued for the whole purpose of this bill, is that we have other consider\u00ad ations that come in when we are talk\u00ad ing about in effect the public carrier. We do have safety involved in this, but I think the point is that I think the gentleman's amendment is unneces\u00ad sary because the Secretary now has the authority to allow that normal process which he alludes to to go for- ward. \u00b7 Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLINGER] will continue to yield, November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26837 under much more strict regulations, I think, under the provision of this bill. Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, I would grant that it is a stricter regula\u00ad tion, but I would urge the Members to vote against this amendment which I think adds unnecessary limitations on the Secretary's flexibility. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, the point that the gentleman from California CMr. PACK\u00ad ARD], the offerer of the amendment, made both in subcommittee and full committee and here on the floor in support of his amendment was one of genuine concern. It was a genuine con\u00ad cern for various conditions under which airline acquisition transactions may take place. There were concerns similarly expressed and perhaps even first expressed by the other gentleman from California CMr. Coxl who said in the course of our committee debate that there may well be circumstances where we have a carrier that may be subject to being split in two to provide more competition rather than less. Good point, valid point. The gentleman from Arkansas CMr. HAMMERSCHMIDT], and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLINGER], and I thought this over, and we agreed that there could be a way in which this could be addressed in the bill, and so we agreed on language which now is in the bill that provides for a condi\u00ad tion under which probable downsizing of a carrier can be approved where such disposal of assets would be in the public interest. It is clear in our com\u00ad mittee report that we intend this very type of situation where such downsiz\u00ad ing would increase competition. We have accommodated the concern of the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. PACKARD] in the bill already. We need not further refine, and define and deal with it in the way that the gentleman's amend\u00ad ment would do because it is already ac\u00ad commodated in the legislation. Mr. Chairman, I urge a no vote on the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentle\u00ad man from California CMr. PACKARD]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE Mr. PACKARD. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were-ayes 107, noes 306, answered \"present\" 1, not voting 19, follows: Archer Armey Baker CRoll No. 326) Cox Crane Dannemeyer De Lay De Wine Dickinson Dornan <CA> Douglas Dreier Emerson Fawell Fields Frenzel Gallegly Gekas Goodling Goss Gradison Grandy Grant Hancock Hansen Hastert Hiler Ackerman Akaka Alexander Anderson Andrews Annunzio Anthony Applegate Asp in Atkins Au Coin Barnard Bates Bruce Bryant Buechner Bustamante Byron Campbell <CO> Cardin Carper Carr Chapman Clarke Clay Clement Clinger Coleman CMO) Coleman <TX) Collins Condit Conte Cooper Costello Coughlin Coyne Crockett Darden de la Garza De Fazio Dellums Derrlc;k Holloway Hopkins Hunter Hyde Ireland James Kasi ch Kolbe Lagomarsino Paxon Petri Wylie (FL) Dicks Hochbrueckner Dingell Horton Dixon Houghton Donnelly Hoyer Dorgan <ND) Hubbard Downey Huckaby Duncan Hughes Durbin Hutto Inhofe Dymally Jacobs Dyson Jenkins Early Johnson (CT) Eckart Johnson (SD) Edwards (CA) Johnston Edwards <OK> Jones Engel Jones Gallo Hoagland Meyers Mfume Miller CCAl ta Mollohan Montgomery Moody Morella Morrison Mrazek Murphy Murtha Myers Nagle Natcher NealCMAl <NC> Oakar Oberstar Rangel Ravenel Ray Regula Richardson Ridge Rinaldo Ritter Robinson Roe Ros-Lehtinen Rose Rostenkowski Vento Visclosky Volkmer Walgren Walsh Watkins Waxman Weiss Weldon Wheat Whitten Wilson Wise Wolf Wolpe Wyden Yates Young<AK> ANSWERED \"PRESENT\"-1 Berman Brooks Conyers Courter Davis Florio Garcia NOT Hertel Mavroules HEFLEY, Mrs. ROS-LEH\u00ad TINEN, Mr. DUNCAN, Mrs. MARTIN of Illinois, and Messrs.

AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE OFFERED BY MR. COX Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment in the nature of a substi\u00ad tute. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Cox: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the following: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION I. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL A VIA\u00b7 TION ACT OF 1958. (a) REVIEW PROCESS.-Title IV of the Fed\u00ad eral Aviation Act of 1958 <49 U.S.C. App. 1371-1389) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section: 26838 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 \"SEC. 420. REVIEW OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS OF VOTING SECURITIES OF AIR CARRI\u00b7 ERS. \"(a) GENERAL RULE.-No person shall, di\u00ad rectly or indirectly, consummate the acqui\u00ad sition of any voting securities of a major air carrier or person who controls a major air carrier, unless the acquiring person has filed timely notification pursuant to the rules under subsection (c), and the Secretary has not entered a stop order covering such ac\u00ad quisition under subsection (b)- \"<l) if such acquisition is of 15 percent or more of the voting securities of the acquired person; or \"(2) if, before such acquisition, the acquir\u00ad ing person holds less than 15 percent of the voting securities of the acquired person and, as a result of such acquisition, the acquiring person would hold 15 percent or more of the voting securities of the acquired person. \"(b) STOP ORDER OR DISAPPROVAL.-The Secretary may enter a stop order against the consummation of a proposed acquisition of voting securities subject to this section pending further review for a period of up to 20 days, or may enter a final order of disap\u00b7 proval of such acquisition, if the Secretary finds- \"( 1 > that the acquisition is likely to weaken the acquired person financially to such an extent- \"<A> that a deterioration in the ability of the air carrier to comply with its established safety procedures would occur; \"CB> that the air carrier would be unable to take the steps necessary to continue to operate with the highest degree of safety; or \"CC) that the air carrier would be required to dispose of a substantial portion of its aviation-related assets in order to meet its financial obligations; \"(2) that the acquisition would result in a person who is not a citizen of the United States having power to exercise control over the air carrier; or \"(3) that the acquiring person has not provided or is not providing, in a timely manner, the documentary material and in\u00b7 formation required by the Secretary under subsection <c>. \"(c) FORM OF NOTIFICATION.-Any person who seeks to acquire, any voting securities of a major air carrier shall file with the Sec\u00ad retary, at the same time such materials are required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/ or the Depart\u00ad ment of Justice, such disclosure documents as are presently required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Ex\u00ad change Act of 1934, as amended, and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts of 1976, as amended, in connection with such acquisition. \"(d) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION.-Any in\u00ad formation or documentary material filed with the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be exempt from disclosure under sec\u00ad tion 552 of title 5, United States Code, and no such information or documentary mate\u00ad rial may be made public, except as may be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent disclosure to Con\u00b7 gress or to any duly authorized committee or subcommittee of Congress. \"(e) COMPUTATION OF VOTING SECURITIES.\u00ad For purposes of this section, the amount or percentage of voting securities of a person which are acquired or held by another person shall be determined by aggregating the amount of percentage of such voting se\u00ad curities held or acquired by such other person and each affiliate thereof. \"(f) DEFINITIONS.-As used in this sec\u00ad tion- \"( 1) MAJOR AIR CARRIER.-The term 'major air carrier' means an air carrier with annual revenues of more than $750,000,000. \"(2) VOTING SECURITIES.-The term 'voting securities' means any securities which at present or upon conversion entitle the owner or holder thereof to vote for the elec\u00ad tion of directors of the issuer or, with re\u00ad spect to unincorporated issuers, persons ex\u00ad ercising similar functions.\". (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.-The portion of the table of contents contained in the first section of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 relating to Title IV of such Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new item: \"Sec. 420. Review of certain acquisitions of voting securities of air carri\u00ad ers.\". Mr. COX (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment in the nature of a substitute be considered as read and printed in the RECORD. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, the amend\u00ad ment that I have offered is in the nature of a substitute. The current bill, despite its good in\u00ad tentions, is overboard. It applies to all transactions. It applies to good trans\u00ad actions, to bad transactions, debt-fi\u00ad nanced transactions, cash-financed transactions. Thus, the bill throws out the baby with the bath water. Moveover, the bill's purpose is to protect airline safety and guard against excessive foreign ownership, but, in fact, H.R. 3443 would require the Secretary of Transportation to dis\u00ad approved for a number of reasons other transactions. The bill under con\u00ad sideration would require the Secretary of Transportation to disapprove trans\u00ad actions for a number of other reasons unrelated to safety or foreign owner\u00ad ship, including a rather vague stand\u00ad ard of competitiveness. Frankly, gov\u00ad ernment bureaucrats probably will not be very good judges of competitive\u00ad ness. My amendment would do the follow\u00ad ing two things: First, it would give the Department of Transportation stop order authority comparable to that al\u00ad ready possessed by the SEC, and that stop order authority would empower the Secretary of Transportation in ad\u00ad vance to stop transactions that would concern safety or foreign ownership. Other pref ectly sound transactions, however, would not automatically be impeded for up to 50 days as is the case under the present bill. Second, the Secretary of Transporta\u00ad tion would judge transactions in ad\u00ad vance on the basis of their effects on airline safety and current laws against foreign ownerhsip. In short, my amendment accom\u00ad plishes those things that the sponsors of H.R. 3443 say that we must do, halt unsound leveraged buyouts, protect airline safety, and prevent excessive foreign ownership. The amendment accomplishes these goals, however, without the needless disruption of our free and efficient capital markets that will be caused by the bill in its current form. Mr. Chairman, I ask, therefore, that the House, please, join me in support\u00ad ing this more workable substitute to H.R. 3443. D 1640 Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The amendment would weaken the procedures established by the commit\u00ad tee's bill and would also weaken the substantive authority which we have given the Secretary. With respect to substantive author\u00ad ity, the amendment eliminates several of the grounds established in the bill for the Secretary to disapprove an ac\u00ad quisition. The committee bill permits acquisitions to be disapproved if they would financially weaken a carrier to such an extent that there would be a substantial deterioration in the carri\u00ad er's ability to compete in providing air transportation. The committee bill also requires disapproval when there would be a major reduction in the size of an air carrier and there are no over\u00ad riding public benefits. The amendment now before us would eliminate these grounds for disapp:roval. I believe that there are sound public policy reasons for disapproving an acquisition which would substantially weaken one of the few major carriers now remaining in the industry. For this reason alone the amendment should be defeated. The amendment also weakens the procedures established by the commit\u00ad tee bill. Under the committee bill, the Secretary of Transportation may re\u00ad quire an acquiring party to file what\u00ad ever information the Secretary needs to evaluate an acquisition and see whether it meets the tests established by this bill. The amendment would ap\u00ad parently limit the Secretary to infor\u00ad mation filed for other purposes with the Securities and Exchange Commis\u00ad sion and the Department of Justice. The amendment is also confusing about whether the acquisition can be carried out before the Secretary has had a reasonable opportunity to review it. In short, Mr. Chairman, the amend\u00ad ment would weaken the bill, and I can't see any advantages to the new procedures established by the amend\u00ad ment. Accordingly, I urge defeat of the amendment. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is to be commended for his efforts to 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26839 prove this bill. However, I must oppose this amendment. Currently, the bill lists several fac\u00ad tors that the Secretary must consider in deciding whether to disapprove an airline acquisition. This amendment would eliminate several of those fac\u00ad tors. For example, the bill now requires disapproval if the debt load will lead to a substantial deterioration in the airline's ability to compete. This amendment would eliminate that pro\u00ad vision. In my view, this provision should not be eliminated. Recent hearings before our Aviation Subcommittee raised con\u00ad cerns about the state of competition in the airline industry. Given the high degree of concentration that already exists in the airline industry, it is im\u00ad portant that DOT do all it can to ensure that healthy competition con\u00ad tinues. This should include turning down acquisitions that could lead to the loss of a competitor in the event of a recession. In addition, this amendment would eliminate the provision that protects against the breakup of a carrier. The elimination of this provision is also a mistake. There are cases where the parts of an airline may actually be worth more than the whole. This amendment would allow a corporate raider to take advantage of that and buy an airline simply to sell off its assets. Breaking up a carrier should be permitted only when that is in the public interest, as is now provided for in this bill. Another problem with this amend\u00ad ment is that it changes the informa\u00ad tion that must be submitted by the ac\u00ad quiring person. The current bill gives DOT the authority to decide what in\u00ad formation it needs to evaluate a pro\u00ad posed acquisition. This amendment would require DOT to use the inf or\u00ad mation now submitted to the SEC and Justice Department under different laws. However, the analysis that DOT must make is different than the analy\u00ad sis required of SEC and Justice. There\u00ad fore, the information DOT would re\u00ad ceive under this amendment may not be relevant. The current bill, which allows DOT to establish its own infor\u00ad mation requirements, is the better ap\u00ad proach. For these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this amendment. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California, the off eror of the amend\u00ad ment, has considerable experience in the business world, and in the field of law, and in the area of financial trans\u00ad actions of the nature covered by this bill, and I respect the very honest effort the gentleman has made throughout our subcommittee hearing and through markup to propose some constructive, thoughtful amendments. This one, however, does shift the focus of the bill. We provide for prior review, which Secretary Skinner said he needed, to deal with such transac\u00ad tions before they are consummated in this legislation, which in effect says stop, look and listen for a definitive period of time, very limited in the bill. It gives the Secretary certain grounds under which transactions must be re\u00ad viewed, and if necessary rejected, whereas this amendment does go for\u00ad ward with the transaction unless DOT then raises some yield signs, caution signs, or halt flags. The deal could be consummated, all wrapped up, as the gentleman from Arkansas said, before the Department has time to act, and I do not think that is wise. The Secre\u00ad tary of Transportation did not think that it was wise and thought that we needed some advance warning, and in fact what our bill does is put the burden on the parties, whereas the gentleman's amendment puts the burden of action on the Secretary. Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield to the gen\u00ad tleman from California. Mr. COX. Just a point of clarifica\u00ad tion, Mr. Chairman. The amendment does make it clear, and in fact it is the purpose of the amendment that the Secretary of Transportation will have authority in advance to look at these transactions. That is one purpose of the amendment. Mr. OBERSTAR. I recognize that, but what I am concerned about is the way in which it provides this authority and shifts the responsibility for action. I think the bill as reported and as pending before the Committee of the Whole provides the Secretary with ex\u00ad actly the authority that is needed, not more, not less. This amendment would undermine that authority, and I urge a \"no\" vote. Mr. CAMPBELL of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requi\u00ad site number of words and I rise in sup\u00ad port of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that this bill and this amendment will not be written on a blank slate, but rather on the background of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act already gives to the Department of Justice and the FTC 40 days and then followed by 30 days to spend in evaluation of the competitiveness of any merger of this size and any effect on competition, and that is the standard that would be applied in such evaluations, is to stop a merger with advance notice if there is any substantial lessening of compe\u00ad tition. The 40 and 30 is more than ade\u00ad quate, more than is provided for in the bill itself, so the only additional ele\u00ad ment necessary would be for the safety considerations, which would not perhaps otherwise be picked up by Hart-Scott-Rodino, which is essential\u00ad ly devoted to competition and anti\u00ad trust. For the safety considerations, while that same 40-and 30-day clock is run\u00ad ning, the amendment of my colleague from California provides adequate op\u00ad portunity for the Secretary of Trans\u00ad portation to evaluate if the acquisition would cause a problem from the safety point of view. So I believe the problem that was identified by the last gentle\u00ad man is indeed accurate, but is already taken care of by the Hart-Scott\u00ad Rodino Act and its provisions for a time period for waiting during which an injunction can be sought. Let me also emphasize that this entire approach is quite unique in set\u00ad ting up mergers in the airline industry for a different standard of treatment than is accorded any other industry. We can have mergers in cement, in steel, in vital industries, indeed in in\u00ad dustries of importance for national se\u00ad curity, without an advanced time period in addition to the Hart-Scott\u00ad Rodino Act. Only in this one area does this bill provide for an additional time period. Truly I believe the burden of proof has not been met that this area re\u00ad quires that special treatment if we adopt the admendment offered by my colleague from California. So in conclusion, I rise in favor of this amendment. I believe it provides the additional waiting period neces\u00ad sary for the safety considerations, whereas we already have adequate waiting periods for the competitive sit\u00ad uation. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chair\u00ad man, I move to strike the requisite number of words and to speak in favor of the amendment. Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. ROHRABACHER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, I note in conclusion the following: The bill before us, H.R. 3443, while it seeks to give additional authorities to the Sec\u00ad retary of Transportation, is in fact op\u00ad posed strongly by the Secretary of Transportation. D 1650 It is opposed by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is also opposed by the President's Economic Policy Council. The bill in its current form will, to a certainty, be vetoed. While there is no certainty that this amendment, if adopted, will be ap\u00ad proved by the President, will be signed into law, it has a much better chance. If it is our effort here to seek to pro\u00ad tect airline safety, to seek to give the Secretary of Transportation advance authority to look at transactions 26840 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 which because of their finances might threaten airline safety or violate rules concerning foreign ownership, then we ought seriously to consider doing it this way, with stop-order authority that parallels what the SEC has, ad\u00ad vance authority for the Secretary that does not interfere with all deals but strikes out only at those which are fi\u00ad nancially shaky. It gives him the tools that he needs to attack leveraged buyouts, if leveraged buyouts in fact threaten airline safety. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this amendment.

Mr. Chairman, the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee on Ways and Means, which I chair, held a hear\u00ad ing last week to look at mergers, acqui\u00ad sitions, and leveraged buyouts in the air transportation industry. This hear\u00ad ing was in followup to hearings held by the full committee earlier this year on LBO's. During the subcommittee's hearing there were pension issues raised which are appropriate to share with the House at this time. We received testi\u00ad mony from the Pension Benefit Guar\u00ad anty Corporation, the PBGC, which insures the defined benefit pension plans of over 40 million American workers. Any financial restructuring, including mergers, acquisitions, and le\u00ad veraged buyouts, can effect the PBGC's exposure to claims. The PBGC testified that a number of large firms in the air transportation indus\u00ad try have underfunded pension plans, totaling approximately $2 billion. PBGC has filed a claim in Eastern's bankruptcy proceeding for $1.1 billion, and SEC filings indicate that Pan Am's pension plans are underfunded by over $550 million. We have learned from experience that financially strained companies\u00ad not just airlines-have funded their defined benefit pension plans at a min\u00ad imum level or not at all. During a merger, acquisition, or leveraged buyout, a company exchanges equity for debt, which may increase the chance that an airline will fail and in\u00ad crease the PBGC's risk of loss. Now, not all corporate restructuring is bad, some are beneficial to the Govern\u00ad ment's pension insurance system. But, PBGC's testimony before the subcom\u00ad mittee clearly indicates that, at this time, there is $2 billion in underfund\u00ad ed pension liability in the airline in-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26841 dustry which may need to be assumed by the Federal Government. The Con\u00ad gress needs to be aware of this fact during deliberation of the amendment and H.R. 3443. There were other tax issues dis\u00ad cussed at the subcommittee's hearings on airline buyout activity which I would like to submit for the RECORD at this time. The subcommittee looked at wheth\u00ad er the tax treatment of debt versus equity, and the tax rules governing leasing expenses, net operating loss carryforwards, investment tax credit carryforwards, employee stock owner\u00ad ship plans, and depreciation, are con\u00ad tributing to the volume of takeover ac\u00ad tivity in the airline industry. The De\u00ad partment of the Treasury testified that the Tax Code provides no greater impetus for a takeover in the airline industry than it does in other indus\u00ad tries. Therefore, it may be that the ways and means provisions in the rec\u00ad onciliation bill which deal with overall leveraged buyout activity could have a positive effect on the growth of buyout activity in the airline industry. Now, the contention is made that the Tax Code is not primarily being used to finance mergers, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts. That may or may not be the case. But I am certain that airlines would be less attractive to LBO's if we did not allow net operat\u00ad ing losses and investment tax credits to be carried forward for 15 years, or if we did not allow 7 years, double declin\u00ad ing, depreciation on airplanes. In addi\u00ad tion, companies in general would be less attractive if we did not allow the deduction of interest on junk bonds; or if we did not allow the deduction up front of certain transaction and loan fees, which are enormous; and, if we did not allow the deduction as interest of the discount on certain original issue discount bonds. Further, I think something should be done about for\u00ad eign ownership of our airlines and it may be that changing the taxation of these investments is one answer. These are some of the things Con\u00ad gress could do, in some measure or to some extent. To not do anything and let the marketplace run its course is unrealistic, and not practical. Hopeful\u00ad ly the administration will provide some leadership on these matters. And, I hope that our committee could produce some bill which has a positive bearing on the buyout activity. I truly believe that we cannot sit back while airlines and other transportation com\u00ad panies, our national assets, take on bil\u00ad lions of dollars in debt. The risks are too great. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, because of the com\u00ad mitments I have made in my role as ranking Republican member of the Public Works Committee, I am going to vote in favor of the bill. However, I do so without great en\u00ad thusiasm. I am very disappointed that we have loaded the bill up with extra\u00ad neous and special interest provisions and am very pessimistic about its future. Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota, the distinguished ranking member and chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation. Mr. OBERSTAR . Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I share the gentleman's dismay that the two amendments adopted in the Com\u00ad mittee of the Whole found such a large vote. They were unnecessary and address issues already provided for in the bill. There is adequate authority for the Secretary to do all those things. But the bill is basically a good vehi\u00ad cle to address the issue of leveraged buyouts and adequacy of competition in the airline industry. I think those matters will undoubtedly be addressed and revised in conference with the Senate, and we will await another day to deal with them. I do urge a strong vote in favor of this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. HAM\u00ad MERSCHMIDT] for his participation and cooperation in every step of the way in this legislation and for the very valua\u00ad ble contributions the gentleman has made in every detail of this legislation, as well as the gentleman from Penn\u00ad sylvania [Mr. CLINGER]. This has been a truly constructive bipartisan effort to reach a bill that is not just a state\u00ad ment, but a bill that is signable and workable and effective. I want to thank the gentlemen for their partici\u00ad pation. Mr. STANGELAND. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong opposition to this bill. Mr. Chairman, with great reluctance, I must oppose H.R. 3443 in its current form. The bill thrusts the Secretary of Transportation into the inappropriate role of second-guessing business decisions, sends the wrong signal to the marketplace, and gets us closer to reregu\u00ad lating the airline industry. I appreciate the hard work and sincere ef\u00ad forts of my colleagues. The committee leader\u00ad ship is responding to a growing concern about leveraged buyouts and their potentially ad\u00ad verse impact on safety and industry competi\u00ad tion. I have no problem with their intent to ensure airline safety. That is one of this com\u00ad mittee's fundamental purposes and obligations to the public. However, I do have a problem with legislating in areas that in my view are best left to the private sector. As recently stated by the Secretary of Transportation, H.R. 3443 would send the wrong message to the investment community, carriers, foreign governments, and the public. In many ways, our bill signals a retreat from deregulation, which has benefited consumers significantly over the years. Current law al\u00ad ready provides the Secretary with authority to review safety, competition, financial fitness and citizenship requirements. I also have concerns about some of the bases for the Secretary to veto proposed ac\u00ad quisitions. We may be straying too far from our traditional areas of concern when we ad\u00ad dress the sale of aviation-related assets. Like the administration, I believe we should as a general rule encourage the free flow of capital among countries and allow marketplace dy\u00ad namics to determine the financial structure of airlines. While opposing the bill, I do recognize some legitimate safety concerns may be involved in selected transactions. As H.R. 3443 moves through the legislative process, I will work with my colleagues to increase the Secretary's flexibility and provide a better balance be\u00ad tween intervention into the marketplace and continued passenger safety. Mr. MINET A. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill offered by my good friend and es\u00ad teemed colleague, the chair of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation's Sub\u00ad committee on Aviation, the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. OBERSTAR]. I commend him for his prompt action and leadership in bring\u00ad ing this bill before us today. I would also like to congratulate Mr. ANDERSON, Mr. HAMMER\u00ad SCHMIDT, and Mr. CLINGER for their role. This bill is most timely. The shape of the air travel industry in the United States is changing day by day. If you don't believe me, read the business section of your local newspaper from just about every day these last few months. Most of the changes are occurring on Wall Street-not in technology, or services, or even in route structure. Make no mistake about it: The financial wheeling and dealing surround\u00ad ing the ownership of air carriers will have a far greater impact on air travelers than any other factor we will face in the next decade. A phrase often heard in the Aviation Sub\u00ad committee is that when we deregulated the airlines, we did not deregulate safety. Our intent was to strengthen our air travel industry. I am certain that other proponents of deregu\u00ad lation would agree with me that we would not have supported deregulation if we thought the changes it might cause would include de\u00ad creased safety, fewer air travelers, or a weak\u00ad ening of the airline industry. So far, we have not seen such deteriora\u00ad tion. However, as we watch the changes taking place in the air travel industry, we have a re\u00ad sponsibility to review the impact of deregula\u00ad tion, and its interaction with other factors in the industry. We have a responsibility to review and a responsibility to act, when nec\u00ad essary, to keep this key economic and strate\u00ad gic component strong. The hearings we held in LBO's of airlines proved that we had cause to be concerned about this phenomenon. My strongest interests are in assuring that the DOT has the appropriate tools needed to do the job, that the decisions made in review\u00ad ing a proposed LBO are consistent, and that 26842 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE they are not reliant upon the philosophy or in\u00ad terpretation of the Secretary of Transportation, whoever that may be. The hearings also made apparent that it is both good policy and in the interest of fair\u00ad ness that any determination to approve or dis\u00ad approve an LBO should be made before the deal is final. Yet prior approval is not required under current law. H.R. 3443 mandates prior approval and cre\u00ad ates consistent standards by which proposed LBO's will be judged. This legislation will strengthen our air carriers and serve our Na\u00ad tion's air travelers. I urge my colleagues to vote yes for H.R. 3443. Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Chairman, the issue before us today is one of basic fairness to the airline workers of this country. The 1980's have become the years of huge, leveraged buyouts, where profits are the bottom line and other considerations are secondary. In this game, American workers and their skills are traded like playing cards, assets to be bought or sold. The human consider\u00ad ations-meeting family needs, health insur\u00ad ance, paying for food and an education for their kids-fall by the wayside as superprofits and possession of companies take priority. But in the end, it is the workers who are laid off, their ranks diminished, their benefits cut, their salaries slashed, while the top executives sit back in their leather chairs and count the profits. The DeFazio amendment will force those buying and selling companies to take into con\u00ad sideration the human side of a takeover. It would require the Transportation Department to take into account during a proposed stock acquisition the effects that the takeover would have on the wages, benefits, and number of airline employees. Too infrequently the con\u00ad sideration of the workers comes last, and it is their skill and training that ensures that Ameri\u00ad can flights are safe for the flying public. This amendment is a much-needed part of this legislation. There is no end in sight to these huge leveraged buyouts and junk bond takeovers, but with this amendment, there will at least be greater consideration given to those whose lives depend on the health and viability of their company. I urge my col\u00ad leagues to strongly support the DeFazio amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. D 1720 Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempo re [Mr. NAGLE] having assumed the chair, Mr. LEATH of Texas, Chairman of the Com\u00ad mittee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consid\u00ad eration the bill <H.R. 3443) to amend the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to provide for review of certain acquisi\u00ad tions of voting securities of air carri-ers, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 275, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Commit\u00ad tee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is or\u00ad dered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the committee amend\u00ad ment in the nature of a substitute adopted by the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment.

The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mr. NAGLE). Is there objection to the re\u00ad quest of the gentleman from Califor\u00ad nia? There was no objection. PERSONAL EXPLANATION (Mr. VENTO asked and was given permis\u00ad sion to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VENTO. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 327, the Cox amendment to H.R. 3443, a bill relating to the review of the leveraged buyouts of airline companies, I am recorded as having voted \"aye.\" I intended to vote \"no\" on the Cox amend\u00ad ment and wish the RECORD to reflect this fact. AUTHORIZING THE CLERK TO CORRECT ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3443, REVIEW OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS OF VOTING SE\u00ad CURITIES OF AIR CARRIERS Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk be authorized to correct section numbers and cross-references in the engross\u00ad ment of H.R. 3443, the bill just passed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 2991, DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPRO\u00ad PRIATIONS ACT, 1990 Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill <H.R. 2991) making appropriations for the Depart\u00ad ments of Commerce, Justice, and 29-059 0-90-16 (Pt. 19) State, the Judiciary, and related agen\u00ad cies for the fiscal year ending Septem\u00ad ber 30, 1990, and for other purposes, with Senate amendments No. 53, 171, and 191 thereto, disagree to the Senate amendments, and request a further conference with the Senate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object, could I ask the gentleman from Iowa what the three issues are that we are going back to conference on? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. WALKER. I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, amendment No. 53 had to do with the formula for distribution of State and local assistance grants; amendment No. 191 had to do with not appropriat\u00ad ing funds to the State Department and the U.S. Information Agency before the conference is completed on the authorization bill; and amendment No. 171 had to do with repealing eco\u00ad nomic sanctions on Argentina. Mr. WALKER. Further reserving the right to object, there will be some concern in this House given the fairly large vote we had the other day on the formula change. Can the gentleman advise us where we are? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. If the gentle\u00ad man will yield further, I am advised everybody is satisfied with the com\u00ad promise that the Senate made. Mr. WALKER. The authorizing committee in the House is satisfied with that particular provision? Mr. SMITH of Iowa. I have been ad\u00ad vised that is so. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I withdraw my res\u00ad ervation of objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Speaker will appoint conferees upon his return. PROVIDING FOR CONSIDER- ATION OF H.R. 1989 Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, by direc\u00ad tion of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 277 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as fol\u00ad lows: H. RES. 277 Resolved, That at any time after the adop\u00ad tion of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause l<b> of rule XXIII, de\u00ad clare the House resolved into the Commit\u00b7 tee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill <H.R. 1465) to establish limitations on liability for damages resulting from oil pollution, to es\u00ad tablish a fund for the payment of compen\u00ad sation for such damages, and for other pur\u00ad poses, and the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. After general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and the amendments made in order by this resolu\u00ad tion and which shall not exceed two and one-half hours, with forty minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the chair\u00ad man and ranking minority member of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisher\u00ad ies, with forty minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation , with forty minutes to be equally divided and con\u00ad trolled by the chairman and ranking minori\u00ad ty member of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and with thirty min\u00ad utes to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendments now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of the bill <H.R. 3394), as modified by the amendments printed in section 1 of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule, said substitute, as modified, shall be considered for amend\u00ad ment by title instead of by section and each title shall be considered as having been read, and all points of order against said substitute, as modified, for failure to comply with the provisions of sections 302(c) and 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended <Public Law 93-344, as amended by Public Law 99-177> and with the provisions of clause 7 of rule XVI and clause 5(a) of rule XXI are hereby waived. It shall be in order to consider en bloc the amendments printed in section 2 of the report of the Committee on Rules, if offered by Representatives Studds of Massachusetts or Miller of California, and said amend\u00ad ments en bloc shall be debatable for not to exceed one hour, equally divided and con\u00ad trolled by the proponent and a Member op\u00ad posed thereto. and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. At the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment. the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopt\u00ad ed, and any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopt\u00ad ed in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in order by this resolution. The prevhus question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan [Mr. BoNIOR] is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, for pur\u00ad poses of debate only, I yield 30 min\u00ad utes to the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. QUILLEN], pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, 7 months ago, on March 24, the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, dumping over 10 mil-26844 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 lion gallons of crude oil into one of America's most pristine waterways. It was the largest oilspill in U.S. his\u00ad tory. After the first few days, the horror of the devastation began to sink in. Thousands of dead fish, sea otters, and fowl washed ashore in toxic muck. By anyone's standards , the cleanup effort was a complete disaster. Indeci\u00ad sion, slow response, and inadequate equipment plagued the operation from the beginning . To date, Exxon has spent more than $1.3 billion-and the amount is still climbing. We were told safe oil drilling was compatible with protection of the en\u00ad vironment. We were told an oilspill wouldn't happen-and if it did, an elaborate contingency plan was in place to handle the mess. We were not told the truth. Exxon cared more about profits than protecting the environment. But the days of corporate insensitiv\u00ad ity to the environment are numbered. Today, after 15 years of deadlock, we have an opportunity to finally pass comprehensive oilspill legislation that makes polluters pay. Alaska's beaches are still black; wild\u00ad life continues to die. I hope this vote will show that the lessons learned are enduring. We will pass this legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support, greatly enhancing our ability to pro\u00ad tect the environment in future spills. H.R. 3394, together with the amend\u00ad ment by Congressmen MILLER and STunns which protects the right of States to enforce their own oils pill laws, will be an even better bill than the one passed by the Senate, 99-0. Mr. Speaker, I feel a strong personal commitment to passage of this legisla\u00ad tion. My district in Michigan borders Lake St. Clair and Lake Huron, and their connecting waterways. The beauty and fragile balance of nature's waters are evident in our daily lives. The Great Lakes serve as a vital freshwater resource for communities and commerce, and are especially vul\u00ad nerable to toxic spills. After witnessing the tragedy and de\u00ad struction in Alaska, it doesn't take much imagination to see what an oil\u00ad spill would do to our way of life in the Great Lakes. In Alaska, the casualties were wild\u00ad life and soiled beaches. In the Great Lakes region, whole communities would be devastated. The contamination of drinking water, the threat to a dense popula\u00ad tion, and the huge economic costs caused by a major spill on the Great Lakes would make the Alaska disaster pale by comparison. The tides and cur\u00ad rents that helped disperse Alaskan oil are not present on the Great Lakes. As a result, effective response time would be sharply reduced. H.R. 3394 would establish an unlim\u00ad ited oilspill fund financed through a tax on oil companies. Damages covered include harm to natural resources , injury to real and personal property , as well as profits and earning capacity. Liability limits would be raised on tankers and facilities, and penalties for oil discharge would be increased. H.R. 3394 would expand Federal au\u00ad thority in the event of a major spill, and require the President to ensure ef\u00ad fective and immediate removal. Most importantly , seven regional strike teams to remove oil would be placed around the country-including one in the busy Great Lakes. Pilot error was responsible for the wreck of the Exxon Valdez. Over the last 2 years, there have been 10 report\u00ad ed shipping accidents on the Great Lakes traced to pilot error. All it takes is a moment of careless\u00ad ness to ruin our environment for gen\u00ad erations. As a further safeguard, this legislation toughens standards for pilots on the Great Lakes and stiff ens penalties for violators. I thank the gentleman from Louisi\u00ad ana [Mr. TAUZIN] and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. DAVIS] for their help on this matter. Today represents a victory for the American people-a victory against the incompetence and insensitivity of corporations who choose short-term profits over the priceless heritage of America 's lands and waters. The polluter must pay and the envi\u00ad ronment must be protected. Exxon's mistakes cannot be repeated . Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 277 provides for consideration of H.R. 3394 to improve oilspill prevention and re\u00ad sponse. The rule is an open rule providing for 2112 hours of general debate. Forty minutes are to be equally di\u00ad vided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries; 40 minutes by the Public Works Committee; and 40 minutes by the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. An additional 30 minutes of debate will be controlled by the In\u00ad terior Committee. The bill shall be considered under the 5-minute rule. The rule makes in order H.R. 3394 as original text to be considered by titles. H.R. 3394 includes an amendment by Congressman MILLER of California printed in section 1 of the report ac\u00ad companying this resolution. It pro\u00ad vides special safeguards against spills of Alaskan oil. Section 302<c> of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consider\u00ad ation of legislation from a committee that has not filed its 302(b) budget al\u00ad locations, is waived. And section 302(0, prohibiting subcommittee levels from being exceeded, is also waived. In addition , the rule waives clause 7 of rule XVI prohibiting nongermane amendments, and clause 5(a) of rule XXI prohibiting appropriations in a legislative bill. The rule makes in order en bloc amendments printed in section 2 of the report, if offered by Representa\u00ad tive STUDDS or MILLER of California. The en bloc amendments are not sub\u00ad ject to a demand for a division of the question. Debate on the en bloc amendments shall be limited to 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by a proponent and a Member op\u00ad posed. Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. House Resolution 277 is an open rule and imminently fair. I urge the adop\u00ad tion of this rule so we may proceed to consideration of this important matter. D 1750 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may use. Mr. Speaker, I would like to com\u00ad mend the majority and minority lead\u00ad ership of each of the five committees that worked on this complex legisla\u00ad tion. We all share the common goal of preventing oil pollution and ensuring prompt and adequate cleanup of any spills which do occur. As is often the case, it is easier to agree on the gener\u00ad al goal than on the specific measures to be employed. And when we get down to discussing the procedure under which the legislation will be considered the problem can become even more difficult. In this case the Rules Committee has provided an open rule, but under this rule one amendment turns out to be more equal than the others. The amendment which received special treatment is one to be offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. MILLER]. The rule provides that the Miller amendment will be considered en bloc, even though it consists of four distinct amendments to four different sections of the bill. During the Rules Committee meeting on this bill, Mr. Speaker, I offered a motion to strike the language providing for en bloc consideration of the amendments. Un\u00ad fortunately, the effort was rejected by a vote of 3 yeas to 6 nays. The vote was split along party lines. So as a result, the Miller amendment enjoys a slightly more advantageous position than other amendments. I am aware that amendments may be offered to strike individual parts of the Miller amendment, but I still think that amendment should not have been given any advantage. It should have November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26845 been treated just like any other amendment. For my colleagues who are con\u00ad cerned about waivers of the Budget Act, I should also note that there are two waivers of the Budget Act includ\u00ad ed in this rule. The Miller amendment which is given special treatment under this rule is designed to eliminate the State li\u00ad ability preemption provision from the bill. Mr. Speaker, elimination of the State liability :preemption provision from the legislation we are considering would be a major setback to our ef\u00ad forts to combat oilspills and would make it extremely difficult to achieve the goals of the bill. This much needed comprehensive oilspill bill would replace the present crazy quilt of State laws with a single Federal regime for liability and com\u00ad pensation. This will be a very strong, very effec\u00ad tive piece of legislation-if we pass it in its present form without crippling amendments. The public would be pro\u00ad tected by a Federal compensation fund providing full, fair, and swift compen\u00ad sation for everyone injured by oilspills. And the States would have an impor\u00ad tant, positive role in oilspill response. It establishes, for the first time, an unlimited Federal compensation fund-involving no Government moneys, but funded entirely by the companies that receive oil by water. The fund ensures that every claim\u00ad for cleanup costs, environmental damage, or for economic injuries-will be paid in full down to the last dollar. This is a tough bill-tough on the oil spillers and especially tough on the grossly negligent. The bill doubles and, in some cases, quadruples oilspill liability from the highest levels previ\u00ad ously considered by the House. These increased limits provide plenty of mo\u00ad tivation to operators to take extra care to prevent spills. But there's no liability limit at all for those who are grossly negligent. And that includes operators who failed to report a spill or who did not comply with a Clean Water Act abatement order. The bill also addresses the concerns of the States to protect their shores, to clean up spills and to compensate citizens for any economic damage. For one thing, it ensures that residents of States will be fully compensated for all economic damages much faster than is possible through State courts. That's true even if the spiller cannot be found, denies liability or is finan\u00ad cially unable to pay damages. In addi\u00ad tion, the Federal fund will compensate States for all taxes and royalties lost due to an oilspill. Nevertheless, the Miller amendment would subject oil transport companies and other oil handling facilities to un\u00ad limited liability under State laws as well. If the proponents believe that will prevent oilspills and protect the environment, they've got another think coming. The amendment could be a death sentence to many responsible opera\u00ad tors-companies that may never have had an oilspill-literally forcing them out of business to be replaced by less responsible firms with fewer assets. Sky's the limit liability under a mul\u00ad titude of inconsistent State laws could make the risks of waterborne oil trans\u00ad portation unmanageable and uninsur\u00ad able. Granted shipping operations have been going on under State liability laws for a number of years. But after the Valdez spill, it's another ball game. In the past, the costliest spill on record was less than $150 million and insurance was readily available to cover damages. But now firms are faced with multibillion dollar costs and no readily available insurance. Even the largest companeis would be betting the farm every time one of its tankers goes to sea. Another potentially devastating result of the Miller amendment is that it would also expose oilspill response organizations to unlimited liability\u00ad disregarding the tradition of good sa\u00ad maritan laws in this country that pro\u00ad tect those who respond to accidents. Consider the consequences, without reasonable, reliable limits on liability, such organizations would have to weigh the economic risks of respond\u00ad ing quickly and eff ectivley to a spill. As a parallel, what community would be able to maintain its volunteer fire department, without reasonable liabil\u00ad ity protection? Let's hold the spillers responsible for the damage they cause and compen\u00ad sate those who suffer economically from a spill. But let's not sacrifice the Nation's ability to respond quickly and effectively to oilspills with unreason\u00ad able and counterproductive liability provisions. By facing up to the need for preemp\u00ad tion of redundant State liability laws, Congress can provide the Nation with a comprehensive, effective and envi\u00ad ronmentally sound oilspill law. D 1800 Mr. Speaker, since the rule provides en bloc consideration for the Miller amendment, I feel that gives the Miller amendment an unfair advan\u00ad tage. Mr. Speaker, I request a \"no\" vote on the rule. Mr. BEILENSON. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only I yield 2 min\u00ad utes to the gentleman from California [Mr. ANDERSON]. Mr. ANDERSON. I thank the gen\u00ad tleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant sup\u00ad port of the rule. It does not include everything we on the Public Works Committee wanted. On balance, however, it does provide the opportunity to address a very im\u00ad portant issue facing the Nation. We need to move ahead on oilspill legislation. It is long overdue and this rule affords us that opportunity. I strongly urge support for the rule. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ar\u00ad kansas [Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT]. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. I thank the gentlman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi\u00ad tion to the rule provided for H.R. 1465, the Oil Pollution Act of 1989. As ranking Republican on the Com\u00ad mittee on Public Works and Transpor\u00ad tation, I feel that the Committee on Rules was unjust in making in order a package of en bloc amendments to this bill. The leadership of all the committees having original jurisdiction over this bill-Merchant Marine and Fisheries; and my own committee, Public Works and Transportation-testified before the Rules Committee stating our op\u00ad position to waiving the points of order against en bloc amendments. Yet, the Committee on Rules ignored our testi\u00ad mony, and went ahead and specifically made in order a package of en bloc amendments to be offered on preemp\u00ad tion and other issues. The reason the entire leadership of the involved committees opposed waiv\u00ad ing the points of order against en bloc amendments that include the preemp\u00ad tion issue, was that we believe that this issue was so important, that it should be voted on, on its own merits, independent of the other issues con\u00ad tained in the en bloc amendments. We felt that including the preemp\u00ad tion issue with other issues en bloc, might simply complicate the issue. This rule reduces the importance of the preemption issue. In addition, I might point out that the rule is also a self-enacting rule. It incorporates an amendment from the gentleman from California [Mr. MILLER] as original text even though this amendment was never reported by the Interior Committee. In my view, this is inappropriate. The bills that come to the floor should be bills that are reported by committees. With this self-enacting rule, the House leader\u00ad ship and the Rules Committee are get\u00ad ting into the bill-writing process. This is wrong. It severely undermines the authorizing process. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col\u00ad leagues to oppose this rule. Mr. BEILENSON. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield 2 min\u00ad utes to the gentleman from New York [Mr. NOWAK]. Mr. NOWAK. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. 26846 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 Mr. Speaker, I too join in support of the rule, but I do so with some reser\u00ad vation. The time provided by the rule for general debate may not be adequate and its distribution could be different. In addition, I am concerned that some very important issues are to be han\u00ad dled in the form of one en bloc amend\u00ad ment. However, this rule does make it pos\u00ad sible to move this important piece of legislation. We must act quickly so we can resolve differences with the Senate, and have the bill become law this year. The last thing we need is another disaster without a comprehensive oil\u00ad spill liability program in place. Mr. Speaker, this rule is not what ev\u00ad eryone wants, but I urge its passage so we can move on to an expeditious reso\u00ad lution of this longstanding issue. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. WALKER]. Mr. WALKER. I thank the gentle\u00ad man for yielding. \u00b7 Mr. Speaker, I guess we should be grateful this is an open rule, and I guess I should be grateful for the fact that I got some time under it as the ranking member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology . But I have got to tell you there are some things in this rule that anybody who serves on a committee of jurisdic\u00ad tion in this House has to be very con\u00ad cerned about. First of all, if you are on the Budget Committee, you had better be very, very concerned about the fact that this waives the Budget Act. It does not waive the Budget Act in mere techni\u00ad cal areas; it waives section 302(b) and section 302<0 and then throws out the germaneness rules of the House with regard to prohibiting appropriations in a legislative bill. Those are fairly serious violations of the process around here by which we spend money. Second, and I think this is a very se\u00ad rious issue, the Rules Committee has said that there is an amendment that ought to be included in the bill that was not passed out of any of the com\u00ad mittees of jurisdiction. The Rules Committee just took it upon them\u00ad selves to include it in the bill. It is not a minor amendment. In fact, if you look in their report, it is 10 pages of legislative language that all of a sudden are slipped into the bill at the Rules Committee regardless of the fact that the committees of juris\u00ad diction had not done any work in this regard. Now, is that the kind of legislating we are supposed to do around here? It is an open rule. That is an amendment that could have been brought to the House floor and could have properly been debated on the House floor. But, no, what we did, we just slipped it into the rule. Under the aegis of the Rules Com\u00ad mittee, we now have a brandnew bill on the floor that did not come out of any of the authorizing committees. That is wrong. That is not a process that we should be countenancing on the floor of the House of Representa\u00ad tives. Finally, I agree with the gentleman from Tennessee who pointed out that yet another amendment was given spe\u00ad cial and preferred treatment under the bill. The Miller amendment that will be offered en bloc was singled out for preferential treatment despite the fact that it is an amendment that the com\u00ad mittees of jurisdiction find very, very troublesome. For that reason I would suggest to all Members who are concerned about the status of committees in this House anyhow and the way in which the power of committee chairmen and those who work daily in committees is being usurped by various powerful committees around the House, you should take a very good look at what is going on here. You are being done in with this rule, and I would suggest that you vote \"no.\" I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. BEILENSON. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield 6 min\u00ad utes to the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. TAUZIN]. Mr. TAUZIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me first say that I think we have got a good product for the House to debate tomorrow. I wish that the rule were just a little bit fairer on the pro\u00ad cedures by which we are going to debate this important bill. The committee which I chair, the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation, and the full Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries have spent many long hours on the bill. I think we have produced a good prod\u00ad uct for you together with the Commit\u00ad tee on Public Works and Transporta\u00ad tion and input of other Members of this body. I think we are going to produce a bill stronger than the Senate bill, which in fact puts in place an extraordinary, I think, regime for the protection of the American waterways and harbors, inlets and bays and sounds to which and through which oil products are transmitted. D 1810 However, let me complain a bit about the rule. Unfortunately, I think the rule does something that Members ought to be aware of when they cast this vote. I intended to cast a no vote on the rule for this particular reason: The en bloc amendments that are per\u00ad mitted under this open rule, otherwise open rule, do, in fact, give preferential treatment to the so-called Miller amendment. Now, the Miller amendment deals primarily with the issue of preemp\u00ad tion, not the old preemption we used to debate on this floor, but a new kind of preemption. We do not preempt the State funds at all. They can decide how to spend their own money in the State funds, and decide to spend their money on prevention or cleanup or on paying claims, if it wants. We do not preempt the funds, but simply in the bill provide for a single liability regime. A single set of liability laws, so that all claim amounts will be working under the same set of rules so that the Federal fund we collect which could be well over a billion dollars would be paid out under the same set of rules for all the citizens of this country. That makes sense. However, there are people who debate that, and would like to change that. I recognize and sympathize with the fact that there are differences of opinion on that. Un\u00ad fortunately, as we debate this preemp\u00ad tion issue, the Miller en bloc amend\u00ad ment will carry with it three other amendments, which the Committee on Rules has not allowed Members sepa\u00ad rate votes on, three other amendments which when we vote on preemption, Members will also be swallowing the fact that one amendment will be saying, for example, that the State courts, not the Federal courts, will de\u00ad termine these issues of Federal liabil\u00ad ity under the Federal regime. One of these amendments will say that there can be an additional local fund collect\u00ad ed, presumably in a municipality around the coast, and additional clean\u00ad up funds that municipalities will have. That will not be preempted under the bill. A third amendment will allow something I think Members really ought to think about. Under the bill we will present to Members tomorrow, it says that the Coast Guard, in con\u00ad sultation with the State, will deter\u00ad mine when the funds are finally used up to complete the cleanup. Under this amendment, it will say the State has the joint authority to say when the Federal funds have been used up sufficiently to provide cleanup. Now, that is a pretty serious change in our procedures. All I am saying to\u00b7 Members is the fact that the rule does not give Members a right to vote indi\u00ad vidually on these issues, and that is wrong. I simply wish the Committee on Rules gave Members that right. Without that right I am obliged to cast a \"no\" vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle- man from Massachusetts [Mr. STUDDS]. Mr. STUDDS. Mr. Chairman, let me point out to the gentleman that he is correct. The rule allows the offering of that en bloc, and deals with four sepa\u00ad rate aspects, whether or not to pre-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26847 empt States in various fields related to this. However, let me say to the gentle\u00ad man that the amendment, although offered en bloc, is amendable under the rule, and if a Member objects to one or more parts, an amendment to strike that part would be in order. Mr. TAUZIN. Mr. Speaker, I under\u00ad stand, but there is no other amend\u00ad ment that is protected in this manner in the rule, only the Miller amend\u00ad ment. It does not just deal with pre\u00ad emption. The last part of this amend\u00ad ment, en bloc, which we will have to vote on altogether, the last part of it does not deal with preemption at all. It deals with the decision of whether or not we will have a Coast Guard in charge of the spill cleanup, making a decision in consultation with the States as to whether the Federal funds have been used efficiently to clean the products up, or whether the States are going to make that decision for the Federal funds. That is a pretty different issue than preemption, of whether or not a State can have its own funds and its own li\u00ad ability system. My point to the gentle\u00ad man is that we have included in the Miller en bloc amendment a number of issues, other than the simple issue of whether or not the State liability system ought to or ought not to be preempted. Whether we ought to have one system of liability or multiple system of liabilities. Let me point out the only reason we have a bill is to end the system of all the separate funds and separate liabil\u00ad ities, all the separate controls that produce the product we had in Valdez when no one was in charge of the spill. The reason we have a bill is to put one fund out there, with one liability system. If Members do not like that and want to change that with a pre\u00ad emption vote, I understand that, but lumping all the other things together I think is unfair. I think for that reason I oppose the rule. Mr. STUDDS. If the gentleman will continue to yield, this is the time to argue the merits of the substance, but if the gentleman is unhappy, as it sounds as if he is, with the fourth part of the en bloc amendment; namely, the subject on the section on the rules of standards, the gentleman is perfect\u00ad ly free to move to strike that. Procedurally, the gentleman's rights are protected. Substantively, we can argue the merits tomorrow. Mr. TAUZIN. It is not the same pro\u00ad cedural rights as guaranteed other amendments on the floor. What the gentleman has done in the Committee on Rules is presented an en bloc situa\u00ad tion where we vote for all those at one time. All we can do is move to strike one or the other, but we do not have the right on the floor to guarantee Members to have a separate vote on each. We have to win that right on the floor. The Committee on Rules could not give Members that right. The Committee on Rules treated every other amendment separately, in giving preferential status to the Miller amendment and the committee finds it objectionable, and asked the Commit\u00ad tee on Rules not to do it. But never\u00ad theless, the Committee on Rules decid\u00ad ed this single amendment, combining four issues, State jurisdiction as well as others, would be lumped together. I find that objectionable. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. PURSELL]. Mr. PURSELL. Mr. Speaker, I think from a point of timeliness, I think this bill is warranted. The disasters such as Valdez, was something that made Members historically look at the fact that we have not worked with the co\u00ad ordination of the oil companies to do preventive medicine in terms of the next spill, whether it be in the Great Lakes or anywhere else in our conti- nental boundaries. \u00b7 Having said, that, the rule, be that as it may, as crafted, is an open rule. However, I would like to suggest also, we have a financial disaster in terms of the budget here, and I parallel it to this disaster. We have jumped on this issue. I think the jurisdictional com\u00ad mittees have appropriately looked at some strong provisions in this bill and will debate the amendments-the Miller amendment and others inde\u00ad pendently. However, generally, the bill is well timed. It is appropriate for this Nation to address the oil disaster, and I think it is appropriate, that hopeful\u00ad ly, we can get some coordination by developing a single account or trust fund with so much per barrel, whether it be 1.3 or 1.5, as is determined by the reconciliation committee to work out a resolution, to set aside some funds by the companies so that the polluters and those causing these accidents, can clean up and have an envirorunen- \u00b7 tally sound country. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Min\u00ad nesota [Mr. STANGELANDJ. Mr. STANGELAND. Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief and rise in strong op\u00ad position to the rule. I support the bill. I rise in opposition to the rule for the reasons stated by the gentleman from Tennessee, the gentleman from Arkansas, and the gentleman from Louisiana. I want to make the point that the title VIII that is added to this bill has not passed an authorizing committee of this House. It also is pro\u00ad tected from a point of order against germaneness, which I think is unfair. I question whether or not it is germane, but is protected. For those reasons, I urge a no vote on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill which is the subject of the rule in question. I also note that the rule is basically an open rule as I and the other members of the leadership of the Public Works Committee and the Merchant Marine Committee requested. However, the rule also specifically rejects the express wishes of our two committees by providing for an en bloc amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. STuoos]. Our committees realized that the preemp\u00ad tion issue would be a very controversial issue that the Members of the House would need to carefully consider and address. We had hoped that this body would be given the opportunity to debate this very complicated issue without a lot of excess baggage. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee has elected to disregard our wishes and allow a complex amendment which unnecessarily complicates the preemp\u00ad tion issue. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to defeat the rule. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. CHANDLER]. Mr. CHANDLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule for H.R. 1465, the Oil Pollution, Prevention, Response, Liability, and Compensation Act of 1989. It is an open rule that by its nature allows consideration of several important amendments. But for rea\u00ad sons cited by the gentleman from Ten\u00ad nessee, I must oppose its adoption. Tomorrow, I will be offering two amendments to help ensure that all large oil tankers entering Puget Sound and heading north to Vancouver, Brit\u00ad ish Columbia have a tugboat escort. Under Washington State law, tug\u00ad boat escorts are currently required for tankers heading to Washington ports. But when they are bound for Vancou\u00ad ver, BC, and travel between Vancouver Island and the San Juan Islands\u00ad Haro Strait-no such requirement exists-even though U.S. shoreline is endangered in the event of a spill. The waters of this area and the San Juan Islands comprise one of the most beautiful and precious resources in the United States. It is unthinkable that we would do anything less than abso\u00ad lutely minimize the risk of damage by an oilspill. I also would like to express my strong support for the Miller-Studds amendment which would strike provi\u00ad sions in the current bill preempting State oilspill laws. Vital national envirorunental legisla\u00ad tion has traditionally recognized the principle of allowing States to set their own laws, and govern themselves without Federal instrusion. This was the case in the Clean Air Act, the su\u00ad perfund bill, and Clean Water Act. State laws should not be preempted in this legislation. I also want to express my support for a mechanism to ensure that oil tankers in the future will have double\u00ad bottom hulls. The Coast Guard estimates that 25 to 60 percent less oil would have spilled in Prince William Sound if 26848 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 there has been a double bottom on the Exxon Valdez. In a previous study of vessel ground\u00ad ing incidents in U.S. waters, the Coast Guard concluded that double bottoms would have prevented penetration of the inner bottom-thereby preventing a spill-in 96 percent of the cases stud\u00ad ied. With the appropriate changes, this bill can do much toward limiting damage from future spills and pre\u00ad venting countless others. D 1820 Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. SAXTON]. Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule. I would just like to say that I understand the objec\u00ad tions of those who have spoken against the rule, and I understand the issue of fairness, and sometimes the lack of it. Sometimes it seems to those Members on the minority side of the aisle that there is a good deal of un\u00ad fairness that happens around here. But in this case, tonight, we are on the eve of a vote that we have been waiting for for years. I have served in the House now for 5 years, and for 5 years the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries almost unani\u00ad mously has stood together in favor of an oilspill liability bill. Tonight we have the opportunity to put in place the rule that will permit us to hopefully adopt a bill to provide for that tommorrow. On the issue of unfairness in terms of the en bloc amendment, let me just point out, as the gentleman from Mas\u00ad sachusetts [Mr. STunnsJ did a few min\u00ad utes ago, that this four part amend\u00ad ment which provides for the striking of the preemption language, the strik\u00ad ing of the preemption language that has to do with State courts, the estab\u00ad lishment of financial responsibility, that Members may feel one way or an\u00ad other about, and the determination as to who determines when the cleanup is finished, are all very valid issues. The fact of the matter is if Members want a vote on any of those issues sep\u00ad arately, they can have it. All they have to do is when we have the debate on the en bloc amendment, is rise to amend the amendment any way they want to. So far as any unfairness is con\u00ad cerned, I believe that while Members may not like the way it is written ex\u00ad actly, given the alternatives that we have tonight, we certainly ought to move forward and adopt the amend\u00ad ment. Mr. Speaker, let me talk to my Re\u00ad publican friends for just a minute. Shortly after the Valdez incident a group of Republicans got together and drafted an oilspill cleanup bill. This bill has almost every provision that we wanted. We were interested in regional strike forces to beef up the oilspill cleanup capacity. It is in this bill. We wanted federally approved train\u00ad ing. That was a Republican idea. It is in this bill. We wanted the equipment on hand to be subject to periodic tests. It is in this bill. We wanted periodic drills, unan\u00ad nounced, supervised. We proposed that periodic drills be made available, be mandated, and it is in this bill. We asked that all this be funded, not by the taxpayers, but by the industry, and it is in this bill. Finally, we asked that there be a computerized network of equipment, personnel, and expertise made avail\u00ad able so that when an oilspill occurs, we can get into that computerized inven\u00ad tory and get equipment that is neces\u00ad sary immediately to perform the cleanup, and it is in this bill. So while Members may feel off ended because there is an en bloc amend\u00ad ment here that we do not like, or at least some Members do not like parts of it, it seems to me that on balance, we ought to move forward and vote in support of this rule tonight and end up adopting sometime tomorrow the provisions that are in the bill that we proposed, that I believe go a long way toward improving the situation with regard to incidents such as that that occurred in Valdez, AK. The SPEAKER, pro tempore (Mr. NAGLE). The Chair informs the gentle\u00ad man from Tennessee [Mr. QUILLEN] he has 6 minutes remaining, and the gen\u00ad tleman from California [Mr. BEILEN\u00ad soN] has 15 minutes remaining. Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to urge Members to vote no on this rule be\u00ad cause of the unfair advantage given to the Miller amendments and als:> be\u00ad cause of the Budget Act waivers. In conclusion I believe we should def eat the rule, and I urge the membership to vote no on the Miller amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal\u00ad ance of my time. Mr. BEILENSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. HUGHES]. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would urge my col\u00ad leagues to support the rule. I think that the authorizing committees have a legitimate complaint. I sympathize with this complaint. Mr. Speaker, we have been debating oilspill compensation and liabilities since I arrived in Congress almost 15 years ago. We still have not put the ball across the goal line. This is an im\u00ad portant piece of legislation. The gentleman from Louisiana [Mr.TAUZIN] has done a remarkably good job in improving the legislation over the years. We have a product now that all Members can be proud of. We do not have in place the protections we need. Not just the Valdez, but just this summer on the Delaware we found that we did not have the tech\u00ad nology, we did not have the leader\u00ad ship. Nobody was in charge. We were using pitchforks to try to clean up heavy oil in the Delaware River that threatened the lower Delaware Bay because we did not have the mecha\u00ad nisms, the equipment. We did not have an inventory of what vessels were available. We did not have the know\u00ad how. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is going to enable us to respond to spills of the magnitude of Valdez and the spill in the Delaware and enable us to do a far better job than we have done in years past. I would say to my colleagues, we can complain about the rule, but the rule is not that bad. It is not that unfair. If Members have complaints about the four amendments en bloc, they can move to strike the three provisions in there. I do not know how we can be any more fair than that. Mr. Speaker, I support the rule. Mr. BEILENSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and move the previous question on the res\u00ad olution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. NAGLE). The question is on the resolu\u00ad tion. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. BEILENSON. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Evi\u00ad dently a quorum is not present. The Sergeant at Arms will notify absent Members.

OIL POLLUTION ACT OF 1989 <Mr. JONES of North Carolina asked and was given permission to ad\u00ad dress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks and in\u00ad clude extraneous material.) Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, tomorrow the House will consider the Oil Pollution Act of 1989. The rule will make in order as original text the provisions of the bill, H.R. 3394, a composite bill which is the combined product of three House committees. In addition, the rule con\u00ad tains language proposed by Mr. MILLER of California as a new title 8 to H.R. 3394. I am placing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at this point a section-by-sec\u00ad tion analysis 3394, THE OIL POLLUTION ACT OF 1989 Sec. 1-Short title and table of contents. This section provides the short title of the bill, the Oil Pollution Act of 1989, and a table of contents. TITLE I-OIL POLLUTION LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION Sec. 1001-Definitions. (1) \"Act of God\" is defined as an unantici\u00ad pated grave natural disaster or other natu\u00ad ral phenomenon, the effects of which could not have been prevented or avoided through due care or foresight. (2) \"Claim\" is the description of a demand for compensation brought directly against a responsible party, a guarantor, or against the Fund. It is distinguished from a cause of action, which is a demand for compensation pursued through the judicial system. <3> \"Claimant\" refers to any person, as de\u00ad fined in section 1001(23) who represents a claim for compensation under this Act. (4) \"Damages\" is defined as injury to, de\u00ad struction of, or loss of natural resources in\u00ad cluding the reasonable cost of assessment of those damages, and also damages for certain economic losses specified under section 1002(b) of the Act. The Committee believes, however, that using the commercial value of these resources to determine damages may be inappropriate and could therefore result in an underestimate of the extent of the damages. <5> \"Discharge\" is intended to describe any type of release of oil, other than natu\u00ad ral seepage. It is used in connection with the definition of \"incident\" in paragraph (11). <6> \"Exclusive economic zone\" refers to the zone established by Presidential Procla\u00ad mation number 5030, which extends 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured. <7> \"Facility\" is broadly defined to include any structure or group of structures, equip\u00ad ment or device used to explore, drill, produce, store, handle, transfer, process, or transport oil. Facilities include motor vehi\u00ad cles, rolling stock, or pipelines, but do not include vessels. <B> \"Foreign offshore unit\" is defined as a structure or group of structures located in whole or in part in the territorial sea or on or over the continental shelf of a foreign country. The definition includes all types of units used for exploring for, producing, or transporting oil from the seabed beneath the foreign country's territorial sea or from the country's continental shelf. (9) \"Fund\" refers to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, established by section 9509 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. <10) \"Gross ton\" means tonnage measured in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Meas\u00ad urements of Ships, 1969. (11) \"Guarantor\" describes any person who provides evidence of financial responsi\u00ad bility required for vessels, offshore facilities, 26850 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 and oil carried in bulk as cargo on a vessel under section 1016. This evidence is to be provided in the form of insurance, surety bonds, guarantees, letters of credit, qualifi\u00ad cations as a self-insurer, or in other forms acceptable to the Secretary. (12) \"Incident\" includes any occurrence or series of occurrences involving vessels or fa\u00ad cilities which result in the discharge or sub\u00ad stantial threat of discharge of oil. \"Inci\u00ad dent\" includes events which directly threat\u00ad en, as well as those which result in, oil pol\u00ad lution. An incident is the event which trig\u00ad gers the designation and advertisement pro\u00ad visions of section 1014. Depending upon the event involved, an incident will also trigger the appropriate procedural requirements of section 1014, as well as removal action under other laws such as the Federal Water Pollu\u00ad tion Control Act, the Intervention on the High Seas Act, or the Deepwater Port Act of 1974. <13) \"Indian tribe\" means any tribe, band, or other organized group or community rec\u00ad ognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indi\u00ad ans. The term does not include Alaska Native corporations. <14) \"Lessee\" is defined as a person hold\u00ad ing a leasehold interest in an oil or gas lease on lands beneath the navigable waters or on submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf, granted or maintained under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. (15) \"Mobile offshore drilling unit\" <MODU) is defined as a vessel other than a self-elevating lift vessel that is capable of use as an offshore facility. The definition is important for the purpose of allocating li\u00ad ability between the responsible party for a MODU and a lessee. This becomes signifi\u00ad cant in the event of an oil pollution incident involving the operation of a MODU on an area leased under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The allocation of liability in these circumstances is described in sec\u00ad tion 1004(b)(2). <16> \"National contingency plan\" refers to the plan published under section 31l<c> of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or revised pursuant to section 105 of the Com\u00ad prehensive Environmental Response, Com\u00ad pensation, and Liability Act. This plan pro\u00ad vides for action to minimize damage from oil and hazardous substance discharges, includ\u00ad ing containment, dispersal, and removal of oil and hazardous substances and describes the manner in which Federal officials will respond to releases of oil or hazardous sub\u00ad stances into the environment. <17) \"Natural resources\" refers to living and nonliving resources, whether or not pos\u00ad sessing commercial value, which are within the jurisdiction of the United States Gov\u00ad ernment, including the resources of the ex\u00ad clusive economic zone, or any State, local, or foreign government. (18) \"Navigable waters\" means the waters of the United States extending seaward to the limits of the territorial sea, as defined in <31) below. (19) \"Offshore facility\" includes oil han\u00ad dling or exploration structures or groups of structures, located on lands beneath the navigable waters, as defined in section 2(a) of the Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C 1301, on the Outer Continental Shelf, or licensed under the Deepwater Port Act. The defini\u00ad tion includes all types of units for exploring for, drilling for, producing, or transporting oil from areas leased under the Outer Conti\u00ad nental Shelf Lands Act, including pipelines. The. definition does not include self-elevat\u00ad ing lift vessels. (20) \"Oil\" encompasses all petroleum, in\u00ad cluding fractions and residues of crude oil. It does include nonpetroleum oil or products such as whale or vegetable oil, nor does it include gases such a butane or propane, which do not pose any threat of causing oil pollution. (21) \"Onshore facility\" means any facility, any portion of which is located in, on, or under any land within the United States, other than submerged lands. (22) \"Owner\" is defined to include those persons who hold title to a vessel, facility, or oil carried in bulk as cargo on a vessel and those who, in the absence of holding a title, possess some equivalent evidence of owner\u00ad ship. It does not include certain persons pos\u00ad sessing indica of ownership <such as a finan\u00ad cial institution) who, without participating in the management or operation of a vessel or facility, or the transportation of oil, hold title either to secure a loan or in connection with a lease financing arrangement under the appropriate laws, rules, or regulations. For example, a financial institution which holds title primarily to secure a loan but also received tax benefits as the result of holding title would not be an \"owner.\" For purposes of assessing liability under this Act, the owner, along with the operator, is considered to be the responsible party for oil discharges from any vessel or facility. (23) \"Person\" includes individual and busi\u00ad ness associations and grnups, as well as all other commercial, legal, or governmental entities. <24) \"Permittee\" means a person entitled pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to conduct geological exploration on the Outer Continenta l Shelf. (25) \"Public vessel\" is a subclass of vessel that performs governmental functions for Federal, State, or local units of government. It is a significant definition for purposes of ascertaining liability. Public vessels are ex\u00ad empted from the liability provisions in sec\u00ad tion 1002 and preexisting law continues to apply. A vessel owned and operated by a governmental entity, however, is not neces\u00ad sarily a public vessel under this definition. A government-owned or operated vessel en\u00ad gaged in commercial service is not included in the definition and would be subject to the provisions of this Act. \"Commercial service\" means all types of trade or business involv\u00ad ing the transportation of goods or persons but excludes those vessels performing serv\u00ad ice as combatant vessels. (26) \"Remove\" or \"removal\" refers to re\u00ad moval of the oil from the water and shore\u00ad lines, or taking such other actions as neces\u00ad sary to minimize damage to the public health or welfare, including damage to fish, shellfish, wildlife, and public and private property, shorelines and beaches. The term encompasses \"response\" type actions to con\u00ad tain, disperse, or dispose of spilled oil. If the injury to, or destruction of, fish and wildlife resources can be averted or reduced by a co\u00ad ordinated mitigation effort, the Committee intends for such an effort to be undertaken as part of the removal to minimize or avoid the environmental damage that ultimately results from the discharge. (27) \"Removal costs\" are those costs in\u00ad curred in cleaning up or arresting substan\u00ad tial threats of oil pollution. These include the costs of all reasonable measures taken to remove the discharged oil and prevent oil pollution from occurring, including those costs incurred by the Federal government under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Intervention on the High Seas Act, or the Deepwater Port Act. Removal costs are recoverable under section 1002(b). The Committee intends that this provision be in\u00ad terpreted liberally, and that only measures which are clearly extravagant, clearly and predictably ineffectual, frivolous, or grossly out of proportion to the actual or threat\u00ad ened pollution should be excluded. Costs in\u00ad curred by a State or local government seek\u00ad ing to ameliorate pollution damage caused by tar balls washing up on a beach used for recreational purposes, for example, would ordinarily be included within this defintion. <28) \"Responsible party\" is the term used to identify the person or persons who them\u00ad selves, or whose guarantors, may be held liable for damages caused by oil pollution. It is a term which may include more than one person. For example, it encompasses both the o\\vner and operator of a vessel or a pipe\u00ad line. With respect to a deepwater port, the responsible party will be the licensee. With respect to an onshore facility, a distinction is made for those which are located on lands owned by a Federal agency, State, munici\u00ad pality, commission, or political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body. In those instances, when the owner has transferred possession and right to use the property to another person by means of a lease, assign\u00ad ment, permit, or other similar agreement, the responsible party is that person or per\u00ad sons to whom such property has been trans\u00ad ferred by agreement. In other instances, the responsible party for an onshore facility is any person owning or operating the facility. With respect to an offshore facility <other than a deepwater port), the responsible party normally will be the lessee or permit\u00ad tee of the area in which the facility is locat\u00ad ed. However, the holder of a right of use or easement granted pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for the con\u00ad struction or maintenance of a facility will be the responsible party for oil pollution damage when such holder is a different party from the lessee or permittee of the area in which the facility is located. Where more than one party holds an interest, other than a security interest, in a lease, permit, or right of use or easement, all such parties will, as a unit, be considered the re\u00ad sponsible party and under section 1002 of this Act and be considered strictly, jointly, and severally liable. Where the vessel or fa\u00ad cility has been abandoned, the responsible party is the person who would have been re\u00ad sponsible immediately prior to the abandon\u00ad ment. <29) \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. (30) \"Tank vessel\" has the same meaning as the term has in section 2101 of title 46, United States Code. <31) \"Territorial sea\" means the belt of sea measured from the line or ordinary low water along that portion of the coast in direct contact with the open sea and extend\u00ad ing seaward a distance of 12 nautical miles. this provision describes the territorial sea of the United States and does not define the territorial sea of a foreign country. This def\u00ad inition is consistent with the proclamation issued by President Reagan on December 27, 1988, and its major effect under this Act is to expand the geographic area in which a spill occurs in the U.S. for which a foreign country may file claims. (32) \"United States\" and \"State\" are used in a broad sense to cover government juris\u00ad dictions, including other territories and pos\u00ad sessions over which the United States has jurisdiction. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26851 <33) \"Vessel\" has the same meaning given that term in title 1 of the United States Code. Sec. 1002-Elements of liability. Subsection (a) establishes the basic statu\u00ad tory liability and cause of action for remov\u00ad al costs and damages. The responsible party for a vessel or facility from which oil is dis\u00ad charged, or which poses a substantial threat of discharge, is jointly, severally, and strict\u00ad ly liable for removal costs and damages specified in subsection <b>. In addition, the owner of oil carried in bulk as cargo on a vessel is secondarily liable for these removal costs and damages. The responsible party and the owner of the oil are liable only for removal costs and damages which directly result from a dis\u00ad charge, or the substantial threat of a dis\u00ad charge, of oil. Thus liability may exist if a vessel were aground and actions were taken to prevent the vessel from breaking up and spilling oil. No liability would result, howev\u00ad er, from the presence of tanker traffic alongside waterfront property resulting in reduced property values because of a per\u00ad ceived potential for an oil spill. Subsection <b> identifies the removal costs and damages which are compensable under the Act, and the claimants who may recov\u00ad er. The Committees intend that this subsec\u00ad tion will be interpreted so that speculative costs and damages will not be permitted. Subsection <b><l> provides that removal costs incurred by the United States, a State, or an Indian tribe must be not inconsistent with the national contingency plan to be re\u00ad covered. Costs incurred by others must be consistent with the national contingency plan. This distinction affects the burden of proof for demonstrating which costs are compensable under the Act. For govern\u00ad ment agencies, the burden lies on the re\u00ad sponsible party <or the Fund) to demon\u00ad strate that a cost is not consistent with the national contingency plan. However, other claimants must demonstrate that the costs are consistent with the national contingen\u00ad cy plan. Compensable damages are addressed in subsection (b)(2). Damages are defined as injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing those damages. This category of damages may be recovered only by a named trustee for the resource. Subsection (b)(2)(B) allows recovery for injury to or economic losses resulting from harm to real or personal property by a person who owns or leases the property. A separate recovery for loss of subsistence use of natural re\u00ad sources is provided under subsection (b)(2)(C) for those claimants who are unable to use natural resources for subsist\u00ad ence as a result of a discharge of oil. When injury to real or personal property occurs and the injury causes a reduction in tax revenues, royalties, rents, fees, net profit shares, or other means of income de\u00ad rived from that property, the Federal gov\u00ad ernment or a State or local government may assert a claim for that lost revenue. Finally, subsection <b><2HE> allows recovery for loss of earnings due to injury to property or nat\u00ad ural resources. The claimant need not be the owner of the property or resources to bring the claim for lost earnings, as required by common law. This means, for example, that an employee at a coastal motel may have standing to make a claim for damages even though the employee owns no property which has been injured as a result of an oil spill. There is concern about the recovery of un\u00ad justified \"speculative\" damages, particularly with regard to lost profits and earning ca\u00ad pacity. Some documentation of prior profits and earnings should be evidenced to support a claim. Of course, the Committees recog\u00ad nize that for new businesses such informa\u00ad tion will not be available; therefore, a basis other than prior profits and earnings must be used. Subsection <c> specifically excludes from coverage by this Act discharges of oil which are authorized by a permit issued under Federal, State, or local law and discharges from a public vessel. Subsection (d) provides that if a responsi\u00ad ble party or the owner of oil can establish that a discharge of oil and the resulting re\u00ad moval costs and damages were caused solely by an act or omission of a third party, the third party is treated as a responsible party for the removal costs and damages. This sec\u00ad tion is used in conjunction with section 1003<a><2>, which provides a third-party de\u00ad fense to liability for responsible parties. However, third parties are not liable for re\u00ad moval costs and damages resulting from simple negligence, when the party acted at the direction of or under contract to the President in a removal action. In this case, the responsible party would be charged for those removal costs and damages attributed to the third party. Subsection (d)(2) provides for a limitation on the liability of third parties. If the third party is the owner or operator of a vessel or facility, the third party's liability is subject to the limitations of liability under section 1004 of the Act. In other cases, the limit of liability for the third party is the limit which would have applied to the responsible party of the vessel or facility from which the discharge actually occurred. Sec. 1003-Defenses to liability. Subsection <a> exonerates the responsible party or owner of oil from liability imposed under section 1002 if the responsible party or owner can prove that the oil pollution in\u00ad cident resulted from an act of God, an act of war, hostilities, civil war, or insurrection. This defense is not available to a responsi\u00ad ble party who failed or refused to report the incident where required by law in cases where he or she had reason to know of the incident. A responsible party or the owner of oil may also escape liability if the responsible party can prove that the incident was caused solely by an act or omission of a person other than a responsible party, an employee or agent of a responsible party, or one whose act or omission occurs in connec\u00ad tion with a contractual relationship with a responsible party. Again, failure or refusal to report the incident where required to do so will prevent a responsible party or owner from invoking this defense. Subsection (b) partially exonerates a re\u00ad sponsible party as to a particular claimant where the claimant has been negligent. This will encourage claimants to mitigate dam\u00ad ages. Sec. 1004-Limits on liability. In certain instances, the liability of the re\u00ad sponsible party or owner of oil is limited to specified levels under this section. The limi\u00ad tations apply to liability for removal costs and damages under section 1002, and any re\u00ad moval costs incurred by or on behalf of the responsible party. This provision will pro\u00ad vide an incentive for the responsible party to immediately begin cleanup activities, which should result in a reduction of other potential damages. For tank vessels, the liability for each inci\u00ad dent is limited to: $1200 per gross ton, but not less than $10 million for vessels larger than 3000 gross tons, or $2 million for ves\u00ad sels of 3000 gross tons or less. For other types of vessels, the limits of liability are $600 per gross ton, but not less than $500,000. For offshore facilities <except deepwater ports>, liability is limited to all removal costs plus $75 million. Finally, for other facilities (including a deepwater port), the limit is $350 million. For tank vessels, a special rule applies which imposes secondary liability on the owner of the oil carried in bulk on the vessel as cargo. The Committees intend to ensure greater care in the selection of the trans\u00ad porter of, and greater interest in the safe transportation of, oil by owners of oil. For oil carried on tank vessels, liability is split between the owner or operator of the tank vessel and the owner of the oil, with the owner or operator of the vessel liable for the first 50 percent of the applicable amount of liability, and the oil owner liable for the remainder. It must be noted that the vessel or facility must expend an amount equal to their limit of liability before the owner of the oil is required to commence contribution. When the owner or operator of the vessel is not entitled to a limit of li\u00ad ability under subsection (a), and thus liable for the full amount of removal costs and damages under section 1002, the owner of oil is liable for all uncompensated removal costs and damages, if any. However, this li\u00ad ability is still limited to 50 percent of the amount of liability which would have ap\u00ad plied to the tank vessel, as calculated under section <a><l>. Subsection (b)(2) contains prov1s1ons which apportion liability for discharges of oil on or above the water among the various parties engaged in activities pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Sub\u00ad paragraph <A> contains the general rule that the owner or operator of a mobile off\u00ad shore drilling unit <MODU) is liable for oil pollution incidents where the source of the pollution is above the surface of the water. Under these circumstances, a MODU used as an offshore facility is treated as a tank vessel. Under subparagraph <B>. if the re\u00ad moval costs and damages from any incident described in subparagraph <A> exceed the responsible party's limit of liability, the MODU shall be treated as an offshore facili\u00ad ty for the excess liability. The limitation on liability is reduced by the amount for which the responsible party is liable under sub\u00ad paragraph <A>. The limits on liability in this section do not apply if the incident was proximately caused by gross negligence or the willful misconduct of the responsible party, or if the responsible party <or an agent or em\u00ad ployee) violates an applicable Federal safety, construction, or operating regula\u00ad tion. The \"proximate cause\" requirement is particularly important regarding the appli\u00ad cable Federal safety, construction, or oper\u00ad ating regulations. For example, the fact that a shipboard fire extinguisher did not bear a current inspection certificate or if one of the life preservers on board was of a design which no longer met inspection re\u00ad quirements would not be sufficient cause to breach a responsible party's limit of liability if neither of the examples could have been the proximate cause of a spill. In addition, the limits of liability do not apply if the responsible party fails or re\u00ad fuses to report an incident when required by law, when the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident. The limits also do not apply if the responsible 26852 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 party fails or refuses to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested by a responsible official in connection with cleanup activities. A final \"break\" for a limit of liability is a failure to comply, with\u00ad out sufficient cause, with an oil pollution abatement order issued under section 3ll(e) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Under subsection (d), the Secretary is au\u00ad thorized to adjust the limits of liability for onshore facilities by regulation, from a max\u00ad imum of $350 million to a floor of $8 mil\u00ad lion, taking into account the factors speci\u00ad fied. The Secretary is also directed to study the relative risks to the environment of oil transported to deepwater ports, and submit a report to Congress on these findings within a year. If the Secretary concludes from this study that the use of deepwater ports poses a lower risk of oil pollution than the use of other ports, the Secretary is di\u00ad rected to lower liability limits for both the deepwater ports and the vessels associated with the ports, as the Secretary determines appropriate. Liability limits for deepwater ports may be reduced from a maximum of $350 million to a floor of $50 million. In addition, the Secretary must report to Congress on the general advisability of re\u00ad ducing liability limits within six months of the date of enactment of this Act. Sec. 1005-Interest. This section imposes liability on responsi\u00ad ble parties for interest on amounts paid in satisfaction of claims under this Act over and above the limitation of liability involved under section 1004. Under section 1005, the responsible party or guarantor is liable for interest on the amount paid in settlement of a claim starting 30 days after the claim was presented, and running to the time when the claim is paid. However, when the re\u00ad sponsible party or guarantor offers an amount equal to, or in excess of, the amount finally settled upon, and the offer is made within 60 days of the date upon which the claim was presented, there is no liability for any interest other than for the period between the time that the offer was accept\u00ad ed and the time the claim was paid. For a similar offer made after the pertinent 60- day period, the responsible party or guaran\u00ad tor will, in addition, be liable for interest for the period between the time the claim was asserted and the time the offer was made. Paragraph (3) provides for an exclusion of liability for interest for any period during which a claimant is not paid due to reasons beyond the control of the responsible party, if it would not serve the interests of justice to include that period. The interest involved under this section is to be calculated at the commercial rates specified in paragraph (4). Sec. 1006-Natural resources. This section concerns liability for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural re\u00ad sources. Damages for injury to and destruc\u00ad tion or loss of natural resources may be claimed by Federal, State, or foreign govern\u00ad ments and Indian tribes for natural re\u00ad sources within the their respective jurisdic\u00ad tions. The jurisdiction of the Federal gov\u00ad ernment specifically includes resources over which it has exclusive management author\u00ad ity, such as those covered by the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. The President shall designate the Federal officials who shall act as public trustees for natural resources under the Act. The Com\u00ad mittees intend that the Federal trustees of natural resources designated in the national contingency plan (issued pursuant to section 3ll(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Con-trol Act and section 105 of the Comprehen\u00ad sive Environmental Response, Compensa\u00ad tion and Liability Act of 1980) or any subse\u00ad quent revision also shall act as Federal trustees for natural resources under this Act. The Governor of each State shall desig\u00ad nate State and local officials who may act as public trustees for natural resources under the Act, and shall notify the President of those designations. Indian tribes shall also designate trustees and inform the President of the designation. Foreign governments may also exercise this authority. Trustees shall assess damages to natural resources under their trusteeship, and shall develop and implement plans for the resto\u00ad ration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acqui\u00ad sition of equivalent natural resources under their trusteeship. Federal trustees may also assess damages to natural resources under a State's trusteeship, upon request and reim\u00ad bursement from the State. Plans must be developed and implemented after public notice, opportunity for a hearing, and con\u00ad sideration of all public comment. The Com\u00ad mittees recognize that in designating Feder\u00ad al trustees, the President may also choose to have the Environmental Protection Agency act as an advisor to the trustees and as a co\u00ad ordinator of long-term restoration efforts. Subsection (d) establishes the measure of damages for natural resources. The funda\u00ad mental measure is the cost of restoration, replacement, or acquiring the equivalent of the damaged natural resource and the dimi\u00ad nution in value of those resources pending restoration. This standard is the one reflect\u00ad ed in the recent D.C. Circuit Court decision, Ohio versus Department of the Interior, No. 86-1526 (July 14, 1989). The basic goal is to restore the resources damaged by an oil spill. However, restoration may take several years to complete, and in the meantime, so\u00ad ciety has lost the use of those natural re\u00ad sources. By pending restoration, the Com\u00ad mittees intend to encompass the time be\u00ad tween the date the damage occurs and ending on the date the resources are fully restored. Where full restoration is not possi\u00ad ble, the measure of damages shall be the lost value of the natural resources, discount\u00ad ed to present value. Subsection <e> authorizes the President to issue regulations for the assessment of dam\u00ad ages to natural resources. The President has two years from the date of enactment of the Act to promulgate these rules, and should consult specifically with Federal natural re\u00ad source trustees on the content of these reg\u00ad ulations. Other interested persons and State trustees should have an opportunity to par\u00ad ticipate in the rulemaking as well, as would be expected under the Administrative Pro\u00ad cedure Act. This provision is intended to su\u00ad persede, to the extent of its inconsistency and with respect to a discharge or substan\u00ad tial threat of a discharge of oil, section 301<c> of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Under this provision, the President delegat\u00ad ed to the Secretary of the Interior the task of preparing regulations to assess damages to natural resources for both oil spills and releases of hazardous substances. A success\u00ad ful challenge to these regulations was re\u00ad cently sustained, and the regulations re\u00ad manded in part in Ohio v. Department of the Interior. The measure of damages reflected in H.R. 3394 mirrors the holding of the court in that case. In accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, any assessment of damages to natural resources made by a trustee in ac\u00ad cordance with the new regulations issued by the President is entitled to have the eviden\u00ad tiary effect of a rebuttable presumption on behalf of that trustee in any administrative or judicial proceeding to recover damages under this Act. Subsection (f) provides for the use of sums recovered by a trustee for damages to natu\u00ad ral resources. The sums are to be retained by the trustee, are available to be expended without further appropriation, and are to be expended only to pay the costs of conduct\u00ad ing damage assessments or restoring dam\u00ad aged resources in accordance with subsec\u00ad tion <c>. Amounts in excess of these pur\u00ad poses are to be deposited in the Fund. The concept that recovered monies should be di\u00ad rectly available to the trustees is one enu\u00ad merated in section 107 of the Comprehen\u00ad sive Environmental Response, Compensa\u00ad tion, and Liability Act, as amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendments and Reau\u00ad thorization Act. The purposes for which the trustees are able to retain the funds are lim\u00ad ited to those which they are otherwise au\u00ad thorized to conduct under this Act. The Committees expect these monies to be re\u00ad tained by the trustees in separate accounts and not, in the case of Federal trustees, de\u00ad posited into the U.S. Treasury as general re\u00ad ceipts or into the Fund, unless they are clearly excess. Unless the recovered money is made available to the trustees, they cannot implement their responsibilities to conduct damage assessments and perform restoration. This has been a particular prob\u00ad lem for the trustees in implementing similar responsibilities under CERCLA and one that the Committees do not expect to be re\u00ad peated in implementing this Act. Subsection (g) authorizes the assessment of a civil penalty in those cases in which the damaged natural resource cannot be fully restored, replaced, or rehabilitated and for which no equivalent can be acquired. This approach is consistent with that recom\u00ad mended by the Administration and reflects the Committees' view that responsible par\u00ad ties should be penalized for lost or injured natural resources in those cases in which restoration is not possible. The civil penalty authorized by subsection (g) is intended to be separate from the measure of damages for loss of natural resources and not to du\u00ad plicate these damages. The maximum amount of a civil penalty is the greater of one-half of the amount for which the person otherwise may be held liable under section 1002 of this Act of $1 million. The penalty shall be assessed by the Presi\u00ad dent in consultation with the appropriate trustees. The bill enumerates those factors which the President must take into account in determining the amount of the penalty, including the person's culpability and the extent of efforts taken to prevent the spill or mitigate damages. The President is au\u00ad thorized to compromise, modify, or remit any civil penalty and, if necessary, to refer the penalty to the Attorney General for col\u00ad lection. State and Indian tribe trustees may also request collection assistance through the Attorney General. The limitation of liability under section 1004 is waived for the assessment of a civil penalty under this title. The sums received from the assessment of civil penalties under this subsection are to be deposited in the Fund and made avail\u00ad able for the general enhancement of the ecosystem of which the destroyed natural resource was a part. Sec. 1007-Recovery by foreign claimants. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26853 Under section 1007, foreign claimants are given rights comparable to United States claimants, provided they meet certain condi\u00ad tions. A foreign claimant is a person who re\u00ad sides in a foreign country, the government of a foreign country, or any agency or politi\u00ad cal subdivision of a foreign country. To be eligible to recover under this section, a for\u00ad eign claimant must first seek compensation for damages from the International Fund, when available; the claimant must not have compensated through some other means for his or her loss; and recovery must be au\u00ad thorized by treaty or executive agreement, or the country involved must provide a com\u00ad parable remedy for United States claimants in similar situations. In the case of oil being transported from the Trans-Alaska pipeline to a port in the United States, a Canadian resident may assert a claim under specified, less stringent conditions. This provision sub\u00ad stitutes for a similar provision in section 204<c> of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authori\u00ad zation Act, which is repealed by this Act. Foreign claimants may recover only if the discharge of oil was from a facility, a vessel in the navigable waters of the United States <which includes the 12-mile territorial sea>. or from a tank vessel that carried oil origi\u00ad nally received at the Trans-Alaska pipeline terminal and the incident occurred prior to delivery to a U.S. port, resulting in the pres\u00ad ence of oil in or on the territorial sea, inter\u00ad nal waters, or adjacent shoreline of a for\u00ad eign country. Sec. 1008-Recovery by a responsible party or a cargo owner. Section 1008 allows a responsible party or the owner of oil carried on a tank vessel to assert a claim for removal costs and dam\u00ad ages if the responsible party can show a de\u00ad fense to liability under section 1003, or if he or she has reached a limit of liability under section 1004. In the latter case, the responsi\u00ad ble party's or owner's right to compensation is restricted to the excess cost incurred above the limit to which he or she is enti\u00ad tled. The purpose of this provision is two-fold. First, it removes any disincentive to under\u00ad take the cleanup of an oil spill based on con\u00ad cerns of potential liability; and, second, it serves as an encouragement to continue cleanup activities, even after the limitation of liability has been reached, by affording a basis for compensation of the cost of clean\u00ad up in excess of the limitation. A guarantor would have the same rights as subrogee to the responsible party or owner of the oil. Sec. 1009-Contribution. This section authorizes causes of action for contribution for any removal costs or damages against any person who is liable or potentially liable under the Act. An action for contribution under this subsection must be brought within three years after the date a court judgment is entered for recovery of removal costs or damages, or within three years of the date of entry of a judicially ap\u00ad proved settlement with respect to removal costs or damages. Sec. 1010-Indemnification agreements. Section 1010 provides that a party may not transfer the liability imposed under this section to any person from serving as an in\u00ad surer or guarantor, pursuant to this Act, nor would it prevent a party who is held liable from taking appropriate legal action against any person whose negligence caused or con\u00ad tributed to the incident which resulted in that liability. This subsection also makes it clear that the prohibition against transfer\u00ad ring liability by agreement does not pre\u00ad clude agreements in which another person may agree to pay for all or part of the liabil\u00ad ity to which a party may be subject. Subsection <a> preserves to parties subject to liability under this Act all rights which they may have, under any other law, to pro\u00ad ceed against any third party. This provision insures that a party will not be barred from recovering against a third party whose neg\u00ad ligence actually caused the incident which resulted in liability being imposed under this Act. When a guarantor is involved, the guarantor would succeed, through subroga\u00ad tion, to the rights of the party for whom he or she has provided evidence of financial re\u00ad sponsibility. Third parties under the direc\u00ad tion of the President, or under contract to the Federal government, who are involved in cleaning up a spill, may not be sued by a responsible party unless the third party was grossly negligent or engaged in willful mis\u00ad conduct. Sec. 1011-Consultation on removal ac\u00ad tions. Section 1011 ensures that the appropriate trustees will be consulted on removal ac\u00ad tions to be taken in connection with an oil pollution incident. Removal actions shall be considered complete when so determined by the Secretary in consultation with the gov\u00ad ernors of affected States. Sec. 1012-Uses of the fund. Subsection <a> enumerates the purposes for which money can be expended from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund <Fund> estab\u00ad lished by section 9509 of the Internal Reve\u00ad nue Code. The Fund is directly available to the President for seven categories of activi\u00ad ties. By \"directly available,\" the Committees intend only that these uses can be paid from the Fund prior to the presentment and pay\u00ad ment of a claim under section 1013 of this Act. Appropriations from the Fund must still be made for these uses. The seven categories include: < 1 > the pay\u00ad ment of removal costs <and monitoring) in\u00ad curred by Federal authorities; (2) the costs incurred by Federal, State <or Indian) trust\u00ad ees in assessing damages to natural re\u00ad sources and for developing restoration plans; <3> the payment of State officials for their removal costs up to the limits estab\u00ad lished in subsection (c); (4) the payment of removal costs and damages from oil dis\u00ad charged by a foreign offshore unit; <5> the payment of administration, personnel, and enforcement expenses, including several re\u00ad ports and studies authorized by the Act, and the research program in title VII of the Act; <6> payments to the International Fund; and (7) all otherwise uncompensated removal costs and damages. This last category must necessarily involve the claims procedures found in section 1013 of the Act. In providing that the Fund can be used for the payment of removal costs, a term de\u00ad fined in the bill to include costs incurred under subsection (C), (d), <e>. or <1> of sec\u00ad tion 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Committees specifically intend to permit the Fund to be used to pay for: the establishment and maintenance of at least seven Coast Guard strike teams, in\u00ad cluding the reestablishment of the Atlantic Strike Team at Elizabeth City, North Caro\u00ad lina, and one in the Great Lakes; systems designed to help prevent spills such as the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service Sys\u00ad tems; and government-sponsored research and development to improve upon existing spill prevention and cleanup technology. The Committees intend, by paragraph (2), to provide Federal, State, and Indian trust\u00ad ees ready access to Fund for the reasonable costs of assessing natural resource damages and for the development of restoration plans. A major impediment to trustees car\u00ad rying out their responsibilities under the ex\u00ad isting Clean Water Act as well as the Com\u00ad prehensive Environmental Response, Com\u00ad pensation and Liability Act has been the lack of up-front funding for damage assess\u00ad ments. This provision is intended to remedy that problem, at least with respect to oil spills. Subsection <a>C7) provides that the Fund is otherwise available for the payment of claims for removal costs and damages which have not been paid through the claims pro\u00ad cedures of section 1013. Thus, if a spiller or owner or oil refuses or is unable to pay a cost for which it is otherwise liable under the Act, the Fund is the back-up remedy. In this way, claimants will be made whole. Subsection (b) recognizes a defense to li\u00ad ability for the Fund. The liability of the Fund is reduced to the extent that the inci\u00ad dent or loss is caused by the negligence of the claimant. Under subsection (c), the President may promulgate regulations designating Federal officials who may obligate the Fund for au\u00ad thorized purposes. Under subsection (d), the President may also delegate the authority to obligate the Fund or to settle claims to State officials operating under a cooperative agreement with the Federal government. Subsection <d> directs the President to pub\u00ad lish proposed regulations within six months of enactment of this Act outlining proce\u00ad dures to be used in obligating the Fund. Final regulations must be published within three months after the close of the regula\u00ad tory comment period. In accordance with these regulations, the Governor of each State, or the Governor's designee, is author\u00ad ized to obligate the Fund for up to $250,000 for removal costs not inconsistent with the national contingency plan, which are re\u00ad quired for the immediate removal of oil pol\u00ad lution. The Governor must notify the Presi\u00ad dent within 24 hours of obligating the Fund. Pursuant to subsection <e>, the United States Government acquires, by subroga\u00ad tion, all rights of claimants who receive pay\u00ad ment from the Fund to recover the payment from the responsible party. Subsection (f} requires the Comptroller General to submit to Congress a complete audit report on the Fund one year after the enactment of the Act, and later as appropri\u00ad ate. Subsection (g) provides that claims against the Fund for removal costs must be presented within three years of the comple\u00ad tion of removal action. Claims against the Fund for damages must be presented within three years of the date the loss and its con\u00ad nection with the discharge were reasonably discoverable, or in the case of natural re\u00ad source damages, the date (if later> on which final regulations are promulgated under sec\u00ad tion 1006<e> of the Act. Subsection Ch) prohibits double payment from the Fund for any removal costs or damages paid from the Fund. Finally, subsection (i) requires that any obligation of the Fund be in accordance with the plans for natural resource restora\u00ad tion, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisi\u00ad tion required to be developed by trustees under section 1006. This requirement does not apply in situations requiring immediate action to preserve natural resources. Sec. 1013-Claims procedure. Removal costs and damages may be com\u00ad pensated by payment from a responsible party or guarantor, or from the Fund. Sub\u00ad section <a> provides that claims shall be pre-26854 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 sented first to the responsible party, the owner of the oil <where appropriate), or their guarantors; except in those situations described in subsection (b). In accordance with subsection (b), claims may be presented directly to the Fund when the Secretary has advertised the claims pro\u00ad cedure under section 1014<c>. This would occur under three circumstances: < 1 > when the responsible party and guarantor deny the source designation made by the Secre\u00ad tary; (2) when the discharge was from a public vessel; or (3) when the source of the discharge is unknown. Claims may also be asserted directly against the Fund by the re\u00ad sponsible party qualified under section 1008. This means a responsible party may assert a claim for removal costs directly against the Fund, either when he or she has successful\u00ad ly asserted a defense to liability or when claiming removal costs which, taken with other claims, are in excess of the responsi\u00ad ble party's limitation of liability. Claims for removal costs incurred by a State may also be presented first to the Fund, as well as claims for removal costs and damages in\u00ad curred by a U.S. claimant resulting from a discharge from a foreign offshore unit. Subsections <c> and (d) provide for a second means of obtaining compensation. Subsection <c> allows for claims against the Fund when attempts to reach a settlement with the responsible party were unsuccess\u00ad ful. The preconditions for this second means of compensation are: < 1 > the denial of all liability for the claims by the person to whom the claim was presented; or (2) the passage of 90 days after presentation of the claim or advertisement by the Secretary, whichever occurs later. At this point, the claimant may elect to commence an action in court, but once having decided to pursue the claim in court, the claimant cannot come back and assert a claim against the Fund while the legal action is pending. Subsection <d> also permits a claim against the Fund when claimants are not adequate\u00ad ly compensated by the responsible party, the owner of oil carried in bulk as cargo on a vessel, or their guarantors. Failure to re\u00ad ceive full compensation could occur for a number of reasons. First, the responsible party or owner of oil may have successfully invoked a limit of liability under section 1004 and the claim exceeds that limit. The balance would be recoverable against the Fund. Second, for some other reason, such as insolvency, the responsible party, the owner of the oil, or their guarantors may not be able to satisfy all claims. Uncompen\u00ad sated claims could, therefore, be brought against the Fund, which serves as a backup for such situations. Subsection <e> directs the President to promulgate regulations to govern the pres\u00ad entation, processing, settlement, and adjudi\u00ad cation of claims against the Fund. These regulations should prescribe documents to be transmitted to the Fund in support of a claim first presented to a responsible party and subsequently to the Fund. These regu\u00ad lations should also establish procedures and standards for the prompt appraisal and set\u00ad tlement of claims against the Fund. Since the primary purpose of this Act is to guar\u00ad antee that claimants will receive rapid and equitable compensation for economic losses suffered as the result of an oil spill, the Committees expect that the claims settle\u00ad ment procedures established by the Presi\u00ad dent will be formulated with this purpose in mind. Particular care should be taken to avoid unnecessary procedural delays or overly complicated bureaucratic processes. Claimants should be afforded from the be\u00ad ginning a clear idea of their rights and obli\u00ad gations, and the administrative process es\u00ad tablished should recognize that severe hard\u00ad ships may result for some claimants if there are delays in the settlement of claims. Sec. 1014-Designation and advertisement. This section sets out the procedure for claims that arise from an oil pollution inci\u00ad dent. The first step in the process is the dis\u00ad semination of information about the inci\u00ad dent. The first person likely to have knowl\u00ad edge of an oil pollution incident is the person immediately responsible for the op\u00ad eration of the vessel or facility. Thus, the person in charge, or employer of the person in charge, must under existing provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act immediately notify the Secretary of an oil pollution incident. Failure to give that notice subjects the person to the criminal penalty provided for in that law. Upon receiving information from the person in charge or from any other source, the Secretary, under subsection (a), initiates the claims process by designating the source of the discharge and by notifying the re\u00ad sponsible party and guarantor involved of the designation. The source designation is important, because the responsible party and guarantor of the designated source will incur certain responsibilities under subsec\u00ad tion (b) if, within five days, he or she does not deny the Secretary's designation. The Secretary is required to designate the source of the discharge \"where possible and appropriate\". This means that there may be some instances where it would not be appro\u00ad priate for the Secretary to designate a dis\u00ad charge source and, by so doing, to set in motion the advertising requirements of this section. Those instances would occur when the nature of the discharge is such that, in the judgment of the Secretary, there is no possibility that any damages from the dis\u00ad charge will be sustained by any potential claimant. If the responsible party does not deny the designation made under subsection (a) by the Secretary, subsection (b) requires the responsible party or guarantor of a desig\u00ad nated source to initiate advertisement of the designation and the procedures by which claims may be asserted. The failure to deny a designation does not preclude a later denial of liability. It merely makes the responsible party or guarantor of the desig\u00ad nated source responsible for setting into motion the applicable claims procedure. Failure to carry out the advertisement properly may result in the Secretary under\u00ad taking that task at the expense of the re\u00ad ponsible party or guarantor. Where there has been no denial of desig\u00ad nation and the responsible party or guaran\u00ad tor advertises properly, claims may be as\u00ad serted against them under this Act. The purpose of subsection <c> is to provide for those instances when the Secretary must notify potential claimants of the procedures by which claims may be brought directly against the Fund. Those instances are situa\u00ad tions when the responsible party and the guarantor have denied a designation, when the Secretary has determined the source of the incident was a public vessel, or when the source of the incident is unknown. Sec. 1015-Subrogation. Subsection <a> provides a right of subroga\u00ad tion for anyone who compensates a claim\u00ad ant for costs or damages compensable under section 1002. If the Fund pays a claimant for damages asserted under section 1002, then the Fund will stand in the shoes of that claimant and may assert any rights that the claimant has under the Act. Very often, this will mean that the Fund will pay off a claim that is asserted against a respon\u00ad sible party and it will then be up to the Fund to recover from the responsible party. The result is to relieve a private claimant from protracted negotiations and litigation with the responsible party, and thereby ex\u00ad pedite the compensation of an injured claimant. Subsection (b) directs the Attorney Gen\u00ad eral, at the Secretary's request, to pursue a cause of action on behalf of the Fund to re\u00ad cover compensation paid from the Fund, in\u00ad cluding costs incurred by the Fund in con\u00ad nection with the claim, interest, and attor\u00ad ney's fees. Actions may be brought against any responsible party, owner of oil carried in bulk as cargo in a vessel, guarantor, or any other person who may be liable for the costs and damages paid from the Fund. In the case of discharges from foreign offshore units, the cause of action shall be initiated against the responsible foreign government or other responsible party. Sec. 1016-Financial responsibility. Another major feature of the Act is the requirement that there be adequate funds immediately available to compensate in\u00ad jured parties. Since the primary responsibil\u00ad ity to compensate victims of oil pollution rests with the person responsible for a pol\u00ad lution source, that person is required to es\u00ad tablish his or her capability to meet poten\u00ad tial liability. Subsection <a> imposes on the parties re\u00ad sponsible for tank vessels over 300 gross tons using U.S. waters or ports, or for tank vessels using the waters of the exclusive eco\u00ad nomic zone to transship or lighter oil des\u00ad tined for a port or place subject to U.S. ju\u00ad risdiction, the requirement that they have insurance, surety bonds, qualify as self in\u00ad surers or have other evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their liabil\u00ad ity up to the level of the limitation available under section 1004. This requirement to maintain evidence of financial responsibility is imposed on all vessels <except a public vessel or non-self-propelled vessel that does not carry oil as cargo or fuel), including for\u00ad eign vessels using navigable waters of the United States or calling at offshore facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, as covered by the Act. Each vessel must carry on board at all times a certifi\u00ad cate, issued by the appropriate U.S govern\u00ad ment agency, evidencing financial responsi\u00ad bility. If a responsible party owns or oper\u00ad ates more than one vessel, evidence of finan\u00ad cial responsibility need to be established only to meet the maximum liability limit of the largest of the vessels. Subsection (b) requires the owner of oil carried in bulk as cargo on a vessel also to establish evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum level of li\u00ad ability the owner may be subject to under section 1004. This requirement is necessary to ensure that the owner of oil, even though secondarily liable after the owner or opera\u00ad tor of the vessel on which the oil is shared, will have the funds to pay the owner's share of the claimed removal costs and damages. Subsection (c) provides the necessary sanctions for enforcing the financial respon\u00ad sibility requirements. Failure to comply with subsections (a) and (b) will result in a termination of the right to engage in trade by triggering a refusal of necessary clear\u00ad ances by the Secretary of the Treasury under customs laws, and may result in the denial of entry or detention of noncomply-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26855 ing vessels by the Secretary of Transporta\u00ad tion. In addition, paragraph (3) subjects any vessel and any oil carried as cargo on the vessel to seizure, if the vessel is found in the navigable waters without evidence of finan\u00ad cial responsibility. Comparable requirements to maintain evi\u00ad dence of financial responsibility are placed on the responsible parties for offshore fa\u00ad cilities. All offshore facilities, except deep\u00ad water ports, must establish necessary evi\u00ad dence of financial responsibility of $150 mil\u00ad lion. This figure represents the Committee's best estimate of liability based on a limit of $75 million plus all removal costs, as provid\u00ad ed in section 1004(a)(3). When the responsi\u00ad ble party is responsible for more than one offshore facility, evidence of financial re\u00ad sponsibility need be established only to meet the maximum liability applicable to the largest of those facilities. In the case of deepwater ports, whose limits of liability may be reduced by the Secretary based on the study required under section 1004(d)(2), financial responsibility must be established to meet the maximum of liability under section 1004(a)(4), or if re\u00ad duced, under 1004(d)(2)(C). To provide claimants with a full range of options for pursuing their claims, subsection (f) authorizes direct action against anyone providing financial responsibility, as re\u00ad quired by this section, for a responsible party. The defenses provided to persons pro\u00ad viding financial responsibility are limited to facilitate prompt recovery by claimants. The person providing financial responsibil\u00ad ity can assert rights and defenses that the responsible party could have asserted, and can invoke the defense that the responsible party caused the incident through gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addi\u00ad tion, the Secretary may authorize other policy terms and defenses which are found to be necessary or unacceptable in establish\u00ad ing evidence of financial responsibility to foster a continuing market for providers of financial responsibility. No guarantor shall be liable in excess of the amount of finan\u00ad cial responsibility which the guarantor has provided. Subsection (g) modifies the preceding sub\u00ad section to make it clear that the liability of the guarantor under this Act is limited to the amount that guarantor has provided as evidence of financial responsibility. Subsection <h> provides for a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of violation for failure to comply with the requirements of this section or with any orders or regula\u00ad tions issued under this section. The Secre\u00ad tary may request the Attorney General to proceed in district court to secure compli\u00ad ance with the requirements of this section. To avoid undue administrative burdens, the Committees expect that wherever possi\u00ad ble the regulations for financial responsibil\u00ad ity for vessels will be consolidated with those under other Federal statutes. In this manner, only one certificate would be re\u00ad quired for vessels to meet the requirements for financial responsibility for the statutes consolidated by this Act, and other pollu\u00ad tion laws such as the Comprehensive Envi\u00ad ronmental Response, Compensation and Li\u00ad ability Act of 1980. This unified certificate is intended to simplify administrative proce\u00ad dures only. Certification under one statute by a guarantor would not necessarily result in certification under another statute. Sec. 1017-Litigation, jurisdiction, and venue. This section provides that judicial review of any regulation promulgated under this Act may be had only if the action is filed within 90 days of promulgation in the Cir\u00ad cuit Court of Appeals for the District of Co\u00ad lumbia. The United States District Courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over con\u00ad troversies arising under the Act. Claimants need not assert any particular amount in controversy for Federal jurisdiction to attach, nor do they have to assert diversity of citizenship to obtain Federal jurisdiction. Under subsection (c), venue lies in the dis\u00ad trict either where the incident, injury, or damages occurred or where the defendant resides or is found, has his or her principal office, or has appointed an agent for service of process. The Fund and the International Fund, for purposes of this section, shall reside in the District of Columbia. Subsection <d> states that nothing in the Act shall affect an action commenced prior to the Act's enactment. Subsection <e> sets forth the periods of limitations under the Act. Actions for dam\u00ad ages must be commenced within three years after the date on which the loss and its con\u00ad nection with the discharge in question were reasonably discoverable with due care, or in the case of damages to natural resources, if later, the date on which regulations are pro\u00ad mulgated under section 1006(e) of the Act. Actions for recovery of removal costs must be commenced within three years of comple\u00ad tion of the removal action. However, an action under section 1002 may be com\u00ad menced at any time after costs have been in\u00ad curred. Actions for contribution for removal costs or damages must be brought within three years of either the date of judgment under this Act for recovery of such costs or dam\u00ad ages, or the date of entry of a judicially ap\u00ad proved settlement with respect to the costs or damages. Similarly, subrogation actions under this Act must be commenced within three years after the payment of the claim. Sec. 1018-Relationship to other law. Subsection (a)(l) provides that, except as provided in this Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act <including the leaking under\u00ad ground storge tank provision), action arising out of a discharge, or substantial threat of a discharge, of oil from a vessel or facility may be brought in any court of the United States or of a State. Accordingly, lawsuits to recover damages for either removal costs or damages can only be brought under this Act in Federal court. However, actions for wrongful death and personal injury are exempt from this restriction and may be brought in any court under applicable State law. The exception for personal injury or wrongful death includes the preservation of State workers' compensation laws. There is no intent to affect the rights or obligations established under workers' compensation statutes. Subsection (a)(2) provides that nothing in this Act or in sections 4611 or 9509 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, affects the ability or authority of any State to either establish or continue in effect an oil spill fund or account, or to require any person to contribute to that fund or account. Subsection (b) provides for the continued authority of the United States or any State or political subdivision to exact fines or pen\u00ad alties for any violation of law relating to an oil spill incident. Subsection <c> indicates that the Act of March 3, 1851, also known as the Limitation of Liability Act, does not apply to incidents covered by this Act. Sec. 1019-Financial responsibility. This section provides that any responsible party or owner of oil who establishes and maintains evidence of financial responsibil\u00ad ity in accordance with this Act, is not re\u00ad quired to maintain or establish any other evidence of financial responsibility under State or local law, rule, or regulation. Fur\u00ad thermore, States must accept evidence of compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of this Act in lieu of any other requirement of financial responsibility which may be imposed by the State in con\u00ad nection with liability for the release of oil. A State may, however, enforce on the naviga\u00ad ble waters subject to the jurisdiction of that State the requirements for evidence of fi\u00ad nancial responsibility as set forth under sec\u00ad tion 1016 of the Act. Sec. 1020-Effective date. Provisions set forth in title I apply with respect to an incident occurring only after the date of enactment of this Act, but no payment shall be made from the Fund before the commencement date, as defined in section 4611(f)(2) of the Internal Reve\u00ad nue Code of 1986. TITLE II-CONFORMING AMENDMENTS Sec. 2001-Intervention on the High Seas Act. This section amends the Intervention on the High Seas Act to make the Fund avail\u00ad able to the Secretary for intervention proce\u00ad dures authorized by that Act. Sec. 2002-Federal Water Pollution Con\u00ad trol Act. This section amends section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The amendments serve numerous purposes. The first two amendments are to section 3ll(c)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Their effect is to modify the national contingency plan for removal of oil and hazardous substances reflecting the continued operation and further enhance\u00ad ment of a system of surveillance and notice designed not only to provide notice of spills but also to help safeguard against the likeli\u00ad hood of spills. This system is similar to the Vessel Traffic Service System currently op\u00ad erated by the United States Coast Guard at only four sites in the U.S., a number which is inadequate in comparison to the need for improved vessel traffic monitoring. The amendments also authorize reimbursement from the Fund for reasonable costs in re\u00ad moving discharges of oil under the national contingency plan. Subsection (d) of section 311 is amended to delete a clause made unnecessary by this Act. Subsection (e) of section 311 is amended to confer upon the President the authority to issue orders or seek injunctive relief to compel persons to clean up oil spills. This authority is to complement the two other ways that the Act authorizes cleanup activi\u00ad ties: voluntary cleanup activities financed by the responsible party and Fund-financed cleanups. The Act also provides that the At\u00ad torney General may bring an action to en\u00ad force a cleanup order against a responsible party, may assess a civil penalty of no more than $25,000 per day for each violation, and may assess treble damages if the responsible party refuses without sufficient cause to comply with an order. Lastly, the district courts of the United States are given juris\u00ad diction to grant relief under this authority. Subsections (f), (g), <h>. and {i) of section 311 are clarified to be inapplicable to any in\u00ad cident for which liability is established under this Act. Subsection (j) of section 311 is amended to delete clauses made unnecessary by this Act. 26856 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 Subsection (k) of section 311 is repealed and any amounts remaining in the fund cre\u00ad ated under section 311<k> are deposited in the general account of the Treasury. The newly established Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund shall assume all liability incurred by the section 311(k) fund. Subsection m of section 311 is repealed because it sets out liability standards for vessels that are superseded by this Act. A new subsection <s> is added to section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide that the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund shall be available to carry out the provisions of section 311 <c>, (d), m, and (1), as those subsections relate to discharges of oil. It is important to note that following en\u00ad actment of this Act, liability and compensa\u00ad tion for petroleum oil pollution damages caused by a discharge from a vessel or facili\u00ad ty will be determined in accordance with this Act. The Fund implemented by this Act, however, will be available to Coast Guard and other government agencies for immediate removal of spills of all types of oil from all sources in the same manner as the fund established by section 311(k) is presently available to respond to those spills. Sec. 2003-Deepwater Port Act. This section amends the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 by repealing various subsections pertaining to oil pollution liability and com\u00ad pensation which are superseded by this Act. This subsection also provides that amounts remaining in the Deepwater Port Liability Fund shall be deposited in the Fund imple\u00ad mented by this Act. The Fund will assume all liabilities of the Deepwater Port Liability Fund. Finally, this section makes it clear that civil penalties for discharges from a deepwa\u00ad ter port or from a vessel in a deepwater port safety zone can be assessed only under sec\u00ad tion 18 of the Deepwater Port Act, thereby eliminating overlapping and conflicting cov\u00ad erage of deepwater ports for civil penalties. Sec. 2004-0uter Continental Shelf Lands Act. This section ,makes similar provisions for the assets and liabilities of the Offshore Oil Pollution Compensation Fund established under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978. Title III of that law which established the Offshore Oil Pol\u00ad lution Compensation Fund, is repealed in its entirety. Sec. 2005-Effective Date. This section establishes the effective date of various provisions in this title as the com\u00ad mencement date provided in section 46ll(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. TITLE III-IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS Sec. 3001-Definitions. This section provides that the terms de\u00ad fined in this title have the same meaning as defined in the International Convention on Civil Liability, 1984. Further, the section de\u00ad fines Convention. This section states that when the Civil Li\u00ad ability Convention and the Fund Conven\u00ad tion are ratified, liability shall be deter\u00ad mined in accord with those Conventions. Subsection (b) provides that the Oil Spill Li\u00ad ability Trust Fund must indemnify and defend the responsible party in actions brought under any law <including State law> for any incident covered by the Civil Liabil-ity Convention. In this case, the Fund acts as the defendant, and, after payment to the claimants, may collect reimbursable costs from the shipowner and the International Fund, as provided under the Conventions. Sec. 3003-Recognition of International Fund. This section provides that the Interna\u00ad tional Fund is recognized as a person under U.S. law and that the Fund Director is the legal representative of the International Fund. The Secretary of State is the Fund's agent for service of process. Lastly, the Fund and its agents are exempt from all direct taxation or assessment of duties in the United States. These exemptions have their basis in paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 34 of the International Fund Convention. This section requires that the Internation\u00ad al Fund be served a copy of any complaint and any subsequent pleading filed in any action brought in the U.S. under the Civil Liability Convention. It also entitles the Fund to intervene as a party in any such ac\u00ad tions. Sec. 3005-Contribution to International Fund. This section provides that the Fund shall be responsible for the payment of annual contributions to the International Fund. The Secretary is granted the authority to require persons making contributions to the Fund to furnish all necessary information regarding oil received by a U.S. port or place. Sec. 3006-Recognition of foreign judg\u00ad ments. This section requires United States courts to recognize decisions made under one of the International Conventions by a court of any nation which is a party to that Conven\u00ad tion. Sec. 3007-Convention financial responsi\u00ad bility. This section provides the financial respon\u00ad sibility requirements needed to implement the Civil Liability Convention and provides sanctions for failure to observe those re\u00ad quirements. This section also establishes a civil penalty to up to $25,000 per day for vio\u00ad lation of the requirements of this section. Lastly, the section provides for the waiver of United States sovereign immunity with respect to any controversy arising under the Civil Liability Convention and relating to a ship owned by the United States and used for commercial purposes. Sec. 3008-Regulations. This section provides the Secretary with authority to issue rules and regulations nec\u00ad essary to implement the two International Conventions. TITLE IV-PREVENTION AND REMOVAL Sec. 4001-Definitions. < 1 > \"Tank barge\" is defined as a non-self propelled vessel constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk as cargo. <2> \"Tanker\" is defined as having the same meaning the term has in section 2101 of title 46, United States Code; that is, a self-propelled tank vessel constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil or hazardous substances in bulk in the cargo spaces. Subtitle A-Prevention Sec. 4101-Review of alcohol and drug abuse and other matters in issuing licenses, certificates of registry, and merchant mari\u00ad ners' documents. This section is intended to give the Secre\u00ad tary additional information on the back\u00ad ground of applicants for licenses, certifi\u00ad cates of registry, and merchant mariners' documents. The purpose of this section and sections 4102, 4103, and 4105 is to ensure that the Coast Guard has a greater ability to identify vessel personnel with vehicle of\u00ad fenses related to the use of alcohol and drugs. Abuse of these substances may have an unsafe effect on vessel operations, lead\u00ad ing to additional accidents and oil spills. This section is intended to provide an ad\u00ad ditional tool in the effort to promote a drug\u00ad and alcohol-free workplace in the maritime industry. The voluntary efforts that the in\u00ad dustry has undertaken to improve the safety of marine transportation through testing and rehabilitation of the work force are recognized and encouraged. Subsection (a) of this section amends sec\u00ad tion 7101 of title 46, United States Code, to require applicants for licenses or certificates of registry to provide access to information contained in the National Driver Register <NDR). Subsection (b) extends this require\u00ad ment to applicants for a merchant mariner's document or endorsement under section 7302 of title 46, United States Code. The NDR is a national compilation of ve\u00ad hicle offenses voluntarily reported by States and maintained by the Secretary of Trans\u00ad portation under 23 U.S.C. 401 note. Under current law, locomotive operators or those seeking a position may provide access to the NDR to a prospective employer. This bill is intended to expand and strengthen this practice for vessel personnel, given the rel\u00ad evancy of alcohol or drug infractions involv\u00ad ing a motor vehicle to safe vessel navigation and the need for drug-and alcohol-free vessel operation. Subsection <a> also requires the Secretary to conduct a review of the criminal record of an applicant for a license. The Coast Guard currently checks Federal Bureau of Investi\u00ad gation records. This amendment to section 7101 of title 46, United States Code, codifies existing procedure. There is no intent that the Coast Guard unnecessarily delay issuing a license. Sec. 4102-Term of certificates of registry and merchant mariners' documents. Subsection <a> amends section 7107 of title 46 to provide a five-year term for certifi\u00ad cates of registry, with a five-year renewal period. Subsection (b) amends section 7303 of title 46 to provide a five-year term for merchant mariner's documents with a five\u00ad year renewal period. Subsection <a> and <b>. Subsection <d> provides termination dates for existing certificates of registry and mer\u00ad chant mariner's documents, calculated as though the amendments made by this sec\u00ad tion were in effect on the date the certifi\u00ad cate or document was issued. This will pro\u00ad vide for a staggered renewal period. Provid\u00ad ing an automatic five-year renewal period will allow the Secretary to ensure that vessel personnel are continually qualified to operate a vessel safely. Subsection <e> re\u00ad quires the Secretary to review the criminal records of an individual who weeks to renew a license. Sec. 4103-Suspension and revocation of licenses, certificates of registry, and mer\u00ad chant mariners' documents for alcohol and drug abuse. Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary to request a person holding a license, certifi\u00ad cate of registry, or merchant mariner's doc\u00ad uments to provide all relevant information contained in the National Driver Register to the Secretary. This subsection also gives the Secretary new authority to temporarily sus\u00ad pend a license, certificate, or document if the individual performs a sensitive function on a vessel and there is probable cause to believe there are grounds for suspension. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26857 The grounds for temporary suspension are: (1) that a holder has performed the sensi\u00ad tive function while under the influence of, or while using alcohol or a dangerous drug; (2) has been denied a driver's license for cause within the five-year period immediate\u00ad ly before the temporary suspension; and (3) has been convicted of an offense for which a license, certificate, or document can be sus\u00ad pended or revoked under sections 7703(2) or 7703(3) of title 46. This subsection also re\u00ad quires an expedited hearing within 15 days of the temporary suspension. Subsection (b) expands the bases for sus\u00ad pending or revoking a license, certificate, or document by adding two new grounds: (1 > the holder is convicted of an offense that would prevent the issuance of the license, certificate, or document; or (2) if the holder is convicted of an offense described in sec\u00ad tion 205<a><3)(A) and <B> of the National Driver Register Act, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or dangerous drugs, reckless driving, or leaving the scene of an accident, within the five-year period imme\u00ad diately before the suspension or revocation. Subsection <c> adds a new requirement to existing law for reissuance of a license, cer\u00ad tificate, or document that has been revoked. Under subsection (c) the former holder must provide satisfactory proof that the bases for revocation are no longer valid. For example, if the basis for revocation concerns abuse of a dangerous drug, the former holder might show that the holder has suc\u00ad cessfully completed a drug treatment pro\u00ad gram and is involved in a substance abusers support group. Sec. 4104-Removal of master or individ\u00ad ual in charge. This section requires the two most senior licensed officers on a vessel to relieve tem\u00ad porarily the master or individual in charge of a vessel when the master or individual in charge is under the influence of alcohol or a dangerous drug and is incapable of com\u00ad manding the vessel. Once the master or in\u00ad dividual in charge is relieved, the next most senior officer shall take command of the vessel, make a detailed entry in the vessel log, and report the incident by the most ex\u00ad peditious means available in writing after reaching port. Sec. 4105-Access to National Driver Reg\u00ad ister. This section amends the National Driver Register Act to authorize any person hold\u00ad ing or applying for a license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariner's document to request the chief driver licensing official of a State to send to the Secretary current in\u00ad formation on that person's driving record contained in the National Driver Register. It also requires the Secretary to make that information available to the individual for comment before the information can be used as a basis for denying or otherwise af\u00ad fecting that person's license, certificate, or document. Information more than five years old, unless relating to sanctions still imposed, may not be transmitted. Sec. 4106-Manning standards for foreign tank vessels. This section requires the Secretary to evaluate the manning, training, qualifica\u00ad tion, and watchkeeping standards for tank vessels of foreign countries on a periodic basis and after a casualty involving a for\u00ad eign tank vessel to ensure that those stand\u00ad ards are equivalent to those of the United States or customary international law and that the standards are being enforced. The Secretary must deny entry to the United States for any foreign tank vessel that does not meet the equivalency and enforcement requirement, except that provisional entry for these vessels may be authorized if the vessel's owner or operator satisfies the Sec\u00ad retary that the vessel is not unsafe or a threat to the environment or that entry is necessary for the safety of the vessel or in\u00ad dividuals on the vessel. The United States has not ratified the International Convention on Manning, Training, Qualification and Watchkeeping Standards. Standards under current United States law are more stringent than those contained in the Convention and those of many other nations. Enforcement of stand\u00ad ards equivalent to those of the convention should be considered as the minimum stand\u00ad ard for meeting the requirement of this sec\u00ad tion, so long as customary international law recognizes standards less stringent than those of the United States. According to a study recently completed for the Coast Guard, the number of foreign tankers calling at United States ports has increased by more than 50 percent in the last three years. As the United States grows more dependent on foreign sources of oil and petroleum products, increased scrutiny of the growing foreign tank vessel traffic is necessary to protest the safety and the envi\u00ad ronment of United States ports. Sec. 4107-Vessel traffic service system. Subsection <a> amends the Ports and Wa\u00ad terway Safety Act to require mandatory participation in vessel traffic service <VTS> systems by appropriate vessels. It provides that no appropriation is to be made for a project to construct, operate, maintain, im\u00ad prove, or expand a VTS system unless it is approved by a resolution adopted by the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. This subsection also requires the Secretary to transmit to Congress a report on propos\u00ad als concerning any VTS system. Subsection <c> requires the Secretary to study whether the Secretary should be given additional authority to direct the movement of vessels and to determine and prioritize the United States ports and chan\u00ad nels that are in need of new, expanded, or improved VTS systems. This subsection also requires the Secretary to submit a report to Congress within one year on the results of this study, along with recommendations for implementation. Sec. 4108-State authority to require state pilotage for tankers. The section amends subsections 8501(d) and 8502(d) of title 46, United States Code, to clarify the general prohibition against States requiring State pilots and levying pilot charges on coastwise vessels. This ex\u00ad emption applies only to coastwise tankers whose Federal pilot's license is not endorsed for that State's waters; it does not include other coastwise vessels, such as barges. Current law permits tankers and other vessels in coastwise trade, unlike foreign vessels, to operate without State pilots. These vessels instead may rely upon Federal pilots to control the vessel in and out of ports of call. This section authorizes the States to require State pilots on coastwise tankers whose Federal pilot's license is not endorsed by the Secretary for that State's waters, and to levy charges for this service. This is a restatement of the status quo. Sec. 4109-Great Lakes pilotage. Section 4109 of the Act corrects a gap in existing pilotage laws for the Great Lakes to improve operational safety on the largest source of fresh water in the world. Under current law, pilots are required on all U.S. vessels operating on register and on all foreign vessels in the Great Lakes. How\u00ad ever, the Canadian government will grant \"B certificates\" to operate on undesignated Great Lakes waters to masters who have only traversed the the Lakes three times in a two-year period. This is a much lower standard than the United States imposes on its licensed pilots under sections 7101(c)(2) and 9303 of title 46. In addition, the \"B cer\u00ad tificate\" is not consistent with the require\u00ad ment of equivalency in section 9302(b) in title 46, United States Code. Section 4109(a) of the Act will establish the U.S. standard as the minimum for any pilot on the undes\u00ad ignated waters of the Great Lakes. The United States has been working with Canada to eliminate the use of these \"B cer\u00ad tificates\", but progress has been extremely slow. In addition, subsection <b> excludes tank vessels carrying oil or hazardous substances from the class of vessels for which a pilot\u00ad age exemption may be granted, except when the vessel or its cargo is in distress or jeop\u00ad ardy. Subsection (c) provides that a vessel can be liable in rem for the costs associated with Great Lakes pilotage service. Finally, subsection (d) increases the penalties for violations of the Great Lakes pilotage re\u00ad quirements, consistent with other penalties under title 46, United States Code. Sec. 4110-Study on tanker navigation safety standards. A comprehensive assessment of tanker navigation safety standards is needed. This section sets out a detailed scope of review for a study of these standards due one year after enactment of this legislation. Subsection <a> requires the Secretary to review existing laws and regulations to de\u00ad termine if they are adequate to ensure safe navigation of vessels transporting oil and hazardous substances on the navigable waters and the exclusive economic zone. Subsections (b)(l) through (b)(3) require specific examination of issues related to tanker crews. Areas to be examined include: appropriate crew sizes, qualification and training of crewmembers, and the emergen\u00ad cy response capabilities of crews in the event of a spill. There are concerns that the size of the crew and fatigue of the crew fol\u00ad lowing cargo loading may have contributed to the Exxon Valdez and Presidente Rivera groundings. These concerns and many others including the Exxon Valdez oil spill are under investigation by the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Without making a judgment on these specific points, a thorough, indus\u00ad try-wide examination of crew and manning standards must be undertaken. The result\u00ad ing findings will greatly contribute to Con\u00ad gressional consideration of international conventions and agreements, as well as legis\u00ad lative and regulatory actions that may be needed to improve the safety of tanker navi\u00ad gation. Subsection <b><4> and (b)(5) require specif\u00ad ic examination of issues related to naviga\u00ad tion. Areas to be examined include the ade\u00ad quacy c,f navigation equipment on tankers <including sonar, electronic chart display, and satellite technology) and the adequacy of navigation procedures (including those relating to speed, daylight, presence of ice, tides, weather, and other conditions). Satel\u00ad lite technology offers great potential for im\u00ad proving both tanker navigation and tracking of tanker movements. In the examination of navigation equipment, these technological innovations should be considered. On the 26858 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 other hand, existing tanker navigation equipment have been cited as potential con\u00ad tributing factors to tanker accidents; there\u00ad fore, potential hazards of existing equip\u00ad ment should be examined. For example, the Coast Guard should evaluate whether alarms for automatic pilots would be desira\u00ad ble. Navigation procedures have also been cited as potential contributing factors to unsafe tanker operations. The Coast Guard should undertake a broad assessment of navigation procedures, including an analysis of existing requirements for personnel on the bridge, in engineering compartments, and at watch stations during pilotage tran\u00ad sits. In addition, this study should review traffic separation schemes , tug escorts, and vessel speeds, among other things. Subsection (b)(6) requires an evaluation of whether certain areas of the navigable waters and exclusive economic zone should be declared \"tanker free zones,\" areas where tanker movement should be limited or pro\u00ad hibited. Precedent for such zones exist now. Canada, for instance, has established tanker free zones to minimize the exposure of its sensitive shoreline areas to potential con\u00ad tamination from discharges of oil or hazard\u00ad ous substances. The Coast Guard should act expeditiously to consider prohibiting tank\u00ad ers from the channel between Montauk Point, New York and Block Island, Rhode Island. The channel is extremely narrow and shallow and has been the site of numer\u00ad ous accidents. In this instance, the Coast Guard should evaluate the advisability of declaring the Santa Barbara Channel off the coast of Southern California a tanker free zone, given the location of a national marine sanctuary in the area. The Secretary should give the particular attention to areas where oil and gas leasing, exploration, or development are prohibited by legislative action. Subsection (b)(7) requires an evaluation of vessel design and construction criteria to reduce the likelihood of a discharge. This element of the study should consider tank capacity, tanker tonnage, barge tonnage, double hulls and double bottoms on tankers and barges, the vacuum method of tanker design or similar technology, overfill and tank pressure monitoring devices, and other vessel features. The Coast Guard should consider other factors, such as vessel hull plating thickness to deal with ice hazards in colder climates in light of the fact that the Exxon Valdez veered off course to avoid ice hazards in shipping lanes. There is considerable interest in a thor\u00ad ough evaluation of the safety benefits and cost effectiveness of requiring double hulls or double bottoms on tankers and barges. Subsection (b)(7) requires consultation with naval architects, tanker operators, salvors, environmental protection organizations, economists, States and communities along tanker routes, and other appropriate per\u00ad sons. The Coast Guard already has a study underway; its scope could be broadened to make it consistent with the requirements of this subsection. Subsection (b)(8) requires an evaluation of the adequacy of tanker inspection require\u00ad ments, including standards for vessel hull plate gauging. Adequate inspection of tank\u00ad ers could be the most effective element in preventing spills. Unfortunately , the Coast Guard does not have the resources to in\u00ad spect on an annual basis every vessel enter\u00ad ing certain harbors. For instance, the Coast Guard was able to inspect only 58 percent of foreign vessels entering New York Harbor in one recent year. Of those vessels inspected, a significant percentage had defects that warranted remediation . The Coast Guard should report to Con\u00ad gress on its ability to conduct annual vessel inspections , the resources required to con\u00ad duct those annual inspections, and the oil spill prevention and removal benefits of the inspections. The Coast Guard should also review inspection standards in general and determine if the frequency of inspections should be increased. Subsection <b><9> requires that the Secre\u00ad tary review and incorporate the findings of past studies, including those by the Coast Guard and the Office of Technology Assess\u00ad ment. Subsection (b)(10) directs the Coast Guard to evaluate computerized simulators for training bridge officers and vessel pilots. These simulators are already in limited use now, and the Coast Guard should consider the potential benefits of greater use of these simulators. Subsection (b)(ll) requires the Secretary to evaluate and test a program of remote al\u00ad cohol testing for masters and pilots aboard tankers carrying significant quantities of oil. Subsection <c> requires the study findings, together with implementation recommenda\u00ad tions, be transmitted to the Congress not later than one year after the date of enact\u00ad ment of this Act. Sec. 4111-Dredge modification study. The Committees are aware that modified dredges have been used successfully in oil recovery operations both in the United States and in Europe. This section requires the Secretary of the Army to study the fea\u00ad sibility of modifying dredges operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to make them usable in moving discharges of oil and hazardous substances . Subsection <b> re\u00ad quires the plementation recommendations, be trans\u00ad mitted to the Congress within one year of enactment of this Act. Sec. 4112-Use of liners. This provision requires the President to report to Congress on the utility of liners or other secondary containment means to pre\u00ad vent leaks, leaching, or spills from on-land oil storage tanks. The need for secondary containment was well illustrated by the Ashland Oil Co. tank, which ruptured and spilled 700,000 gallons of diesel oil into the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers in January, 1988. Following the completion of the study, the President must implement any study recommendations. Subtitle B-Removal Sec. 4201-Federal removal authority. This section amends section 311<c> of the Clean Water Act to require the President to ensure an effective and immediate removal of oil or hazardous substances from U.S. navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, and the exclusive economic zone in accordance with the national contingency plan and other contingency plans. This section clari\u00ad fies the President's responsibilities , and ex\u00ad pands the President 's options in responding to a spill of oil or hazardous substances. Amended section 31l(c)(l)(A) requires the President to ensure an effective and imme\u00ad diate removal of discharged oil or hazardous substances on the navigable waters, adjoin\u00ad ing shorelines, the exclusive economic zone, or if the discharge affects natural resources of the United States. This section makes it clear that the President has an affirmative duty to make certain that a spill is cleaned up promptly, whether it is accomplished by the Federal government or the responsible party. In addition, the section requires the President to make sure that cleanup activi\u00ad ties are accomplished in accordance with the National Contingency Plan, and other contingency plans required by law, such as local, vessel, and facility plans under section 311(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Con\u00ad trol Act. Section 311Cc)( l)(B) continues the Presi\u00ad dent's authority to remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge. The first option that is available is for the President to take charge of cleanup activities using the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to pay expenses : Under this option, the President need not first wait to determine that the responsible party is conducting inadequate cleanup, but may initiate action immediately . This re\u00ad sponds to the concerns expressed by several members of the Committees that precious time could be lost while waiting for the spiller to marshal its cleanup forces. In ad\u00ad dition, because the full resources of the Fund would be available to finance Federal cleanups , the President should not be reti\u00ad cent about using this option. Section 31l(c)(l)(B) also authorizes the President to direct all Federal, State, and private actions to remove a discharge. The Committees recognize that there may be in\u00ad stances when complete Federal control is not necessary, but it is necessary for the Federal government to play a more signifi\u00ad cant role than merely monitoring cleanup activities. In this case, the Federal govern\u00ad ment would assume command of some or all of the cleanup activities and would direct and coordinate removal activities carried out by responsible parties and others. This authority could be used in a more limited way. This section also recognizes a final option that the President may simply monitor re\u00ad moval activities . Section 311<a)(l}(C} allocates the primary risk of liability arising from removal and cleanup activities to the responsible party rather than to those persons cleaning up the spill under the direction of or as re\u00ad tained by the Federal government. The Committees intend to ensure immediate re\u00ad sponse to oil and hazardous substance spills and believe this provision is necessary in light of the substantial financial risks and liability exposure that would otherwise deter vessel operators, spill cooperatives, and spill contractors from providing active assistance. To avoid paralysis of remedial actions, this paragraph provides that those per\u00ad sons-other than responsible parties-who are retained or directed by the President to participate in a cleanup action will not be liable for removal costs or damages as de\u00ad fined in this legislation, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct . This limitation of liability does not affect li\u00ad ability for wrongful death or personal injury. It does not diminish the liability of those responsible for the spill nor the amount of compensation available to claim\u00ad ants. This limited protection is intended to encourage individuals to assist in cleanup operations. Section 31l(c)0)(D) requires the responsi\u00ad ble party to act in accordance with the na\u00ad tional contingency plan, other applicable contingency plans, and as otherwise directed by the President. This provision is also in\u00ad tended to underscore the fundamental obli\u00ad gation that the responsible party has to be prepared at all times and to take immediate and effective action in the event of a dis\u00ad charge. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26859 Section 311(c)(l)(E) provides that the li\u00ad ability of the responsible party is not affect\u00ad ed by the Federal authorities delineated in this section. When the President directs cleanup actions under new section 311Cc)(l), the responsible party is not excused from payment of removal costs and damages. Section 420l(b) amends the definitions in section 311 of the Clean Water Act. The def\u00ad inition of \" 'remove' or 'removal' \" in the Clean Water Act is expanded to include con\u00ad tainment, dispersal, disposal, and other re\u00ad sponse actions. \"exclusive economic zone\" as well as \"responsible party\" are added. Sec. 4202-Contingency plans. Section 4202 amends section 311(j) of the Clean Water Act. New section 31l(j) codifies and expands requirements presently exist\u00ad ing for local contingency plans and facility contingency plans, and institutes a new re\u00ad quirement for vessel contingency plans. The Committees intend that contingency plans be prepared under the Clean Water Act, be\u00ad ginning with the national contingency plan, and leading down to local plans and then in\u00ad dividual vessel and facility plans. All plans must be coordinated to ensure an immediate and effective removal of a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance. The level of detail will increase as the plans move from the general national plan to the specific vessel and facility plans. The Committee intends that the existing plans be examined and modified if necessary to comport with the new requirements of the Act, to save time and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. Section 31l(j)(3HA> mandates the Presi\u00ad dent, within six months of enactment of this Act, to designate areas for which new or improved local oil and hazardous sub\u00ad stance contingency plans must be prepared, and to specify the Federal, State and local officials required to prepare the plans, in consultation with affected parties. The Committees note that numerous spills have occurred in the Long Island Sound, New York Harbor, and Hudson River regions. In light of the number of spills, and environ\u00ad mental and economic damage these spills have caused, the President shall designate the Long Island Sound, New York Harbor, and Hudson River region as one of the areas for which a new or improved local contin\u00ad gency plan must be prepared. The Commit\u00ad tees also recognize that preparation of these plans, especially in areas where no earlier plan existed, will require time and money from all levels of government. The Commit\u00ad tees do not intend that local governments, whose resources are often the most limited, be required to spend unduly large amounts of money in preparing these plans. The fi\u00ad nancial burden should be shared. Section 31l(j)(3)(B) requires the President to consult with appropriate State and local officials and the public in determining the areas to be designated. The President must consider certain factors in determining des\u00ad ignated areas, including the likelihood of a discharge, the likelihood that the discharge would result in severe economic or environ\u00ad mental damage, and the adequacy of exist\u00ad ing local plans. Because State and local offi\u00ad cials will be implementing the plans under this section, it is imperative that their input and cooperation be obtained. Section 311(j)(3)(C) requires local plans under this section to include a description of the area, including areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be damaged; a description of the responsibil\u00ad ities of Federal, State, and local agencies, and the responsible party for responding to a discharge or threat of discharge; a list of equipment and personnel available to ensure an immediate and effective removal of a discharge; and any other information the President requires. Section 311(j)(3)(D) requires that local plans mandated under this section be sub\u00ad mitted to the President within six months after the local areas requiring plans are des\u00ad ignated. The President is required to promptly review each plan and require amendments to a plan that does not meet the necessary requirements. There is no re\u00ad quirement that the President approve each plan. Section 311(j)(3)<E> requires periodic review of plans by the President and up\u00ad dates, if necessary. Section 311Cj)(3)(F) authorizes the Presi\u00ad dent to provide technical assistance in the preparation of local contingency plans. Section 311(j)(4)(A) requires owners or op\u00ad erators of certain vessels and facilities to prepare contingency plans not later than eighteen months after the enactment of this Act. A plan is required for a vessel oper\u00ad ating on the navigable waters or exclusive economic zone and carrying oil or a hazard\u00ad ous substance in bulk as cargo. A plan is also required for an offshore or onshore fa\u00ad cility that could reasonably discharge into or on the navigable waters, the adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone. Section 31l(j)(4)(B) requires that vessel and facility plans be consistent, and ensure compliance by the owner or operator, with the national contingency plan, and any local contingency plan. The effective dates in subsections (j)(3)(A) , (j)(3)(D) , and (j)(4HA> are staggered to insure that there will be an opportunity for orderly preparation and co\u00ad ordination of the various plans. Section 311(j)(4)(B) also requires that con\u00ad tingency plans for vessel and facilities meet other important requirements. Plans must be timely submitted ; be available for review by State and local officials, and the public; identify the individual having authority to implement a removal action, and to require immediate communications between that in\u00ad dividual and the appropriate Federal official and cleanup personnel; describe the specific actions that will be taken to remove a dis\u00ad charge; identify and ensure the availability of personnel and equipment that will be necessary to remove a discharge; include a program of personnel training, equipment testing, and periodic unannounced drills; de\u00ad scribe the conditions under which disper\u00ad sants may be used; include provisions for the safe disposal of recovered materials and waste; and be updated periodically. The Committees recognize that vessels will face challenges in complying with this section given the fact of their mobility. Since vessels transit through various ports, the Committees envision that the owner or operator of a vessel will make available to the master or other person in charge of the vessel the necessary information concerning the resources in specific ports that can assist the vessel in complying with the re\u00ad quirements of this subparagraph in the event of a discharge. Therefore, it will not be necessary for the vessel to have on board all the personnel and equipment required to respond to a discharge, but the personnel aboard the vessel must immediately contact persons on shore who can respond rapidly. Private contractors will play an important part in enabling vessels to meet their re\u00ad sponsibilities under this Act. Section 311(j)(4)(C) prohibits a vessel or facility from handling , storing, or transport-ing oil unless a contingency plan has been submitted, has not been rejected, and the vessel or facility is operating in compliance with the plan. Section 311(j)(4)(D) requires the Presi\u00ad dent to review the plans and reject or re\u00ad quire amendments to them as appropriate. There is no requirement for the plans to be approved. Section 31l(j)(4)(E) authorizes the Presi\u00ad dent to exclude a class of vessels or facilities from preparation of a contingency plan if the requirements have been met under other law, such as the Comprehensive Envi\u00ad ronmental Response, Compensation, and Li\u00ad ability Act. Section 311(j)(5) requires the President, not later than one year after enactment of the Act, to insure periodic inspection of con\u00ad tainment booms, skimmers, vessels, and other major equipment used to remove dis\u00ad charges. The President must also ensure that vessels operating on the navigable waters carry appropriate removal equip\u00ad ment that employs the best technology compatible with the safe operation of the vessel. The Committees are particularly in\u00ad terested in an evaluation of whether oil con\u00ad tainment booms should be carried abroad vessels and if they can be safely deployed by the crew in the event of a discharge. Section 311(j)(5) also requires the Presi\u00ad dent, through the Secretary, to conduct periodic drills of removal capability in major ports under local contingency plans and vessel and facility contingency plans. The drills must be coordinated with Feder\u00ad al, State, and local agencies, the owners and operators of vessels and facilities in the area, and private industry. The Secretary is required to publish reports assessing these drills and detailing the changes made to remedy any shortcomings. Sec. 4203-Strike teams. This section requires establishment of at least seven continuously staffed oil and haz\u00ad ardous substance regional strike teams under the National Contingency Plan. The President should consider siting strike teams in Alaska, Hawaii, the Pacific coast, the Gulf of Mexico, the South Atlantic coast, the North Atlantic coast, and the Great Lakes. This will provide complete and timely response capacity to all areas of the United States. In setting up the teams, consideration is to be given to existing Federal, State, local, and provide response resources that are available. For instance, there is the possibil\u00ad ity that the Regional Response Centers, which have been proposed to be established by the Petroleum Industry Response Orga\u00ad nization <PIRO), may be able to provide suf\u00ad ficient equipment and personnel to respond immediately and effectively to spills. If these centers are established, the Coast Guard strike team could be colocated with the PIRO center and not require a full scale Federal contingent of personnel and equip\u00ad ment. Sec. 4204-Coast Guard vessel design. The Coast Guard is preparing vessel de\u00ad signs for a much-needed buoy tender re\u00ad placement program. The existing buoy tender fleet is 45 to 50 years old, expensive to operate and maintain, and inadequate for the multi-mission responsibilities they are expected to perform. Buoy tenders are sta\u00ad tioned at strategic port and channel loca\u00ad tions around the country. If properly outfit\u00ad ted, the replacement buoy tenders can be readily available to remove oil and hazard\u00ad ous substance from U.S. waters. This section requires replacement Coast Guard buoy 26860 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 tenders be equipped with oil skimming sys\u00ad tems. Sec. 4205-Removal resource inventory. This section requires a computerized in\u00ad ventory of all public and private oil and haz\u00ad ardous substances removal resources, in\u00ad cluding equipment and personnel. Such an inventory was operated by the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment prior to 1985, but fell victim to budget cuts. Funding for this critical tool would come from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund established by section 9509 of the Internal Revenue Code, as an adminis\u00ad trative expense. The information in the in\u00ad ventory would be available to Federal, State, and local governments, private orga\u00ad nizations, and responsible parties. The Sec\u00ad retary should use the vessel identification system under chapter 125 of title 46, United States Code, to keep track of information on vessels for this purpose. The President is also directed to encour\u00ad age appropriate international organizations, such as the International Joint Commission , to establish an international inventory of emergency removal resources. Subtitle C-Miscellaneous Sec. 4301-Increased penalties. Section 4301Ca)(l) amends section 311Cb) of the Clean Water Act by expanding its notice requirements. If the Coast Guard or other appropriate Federal agency is notified of a discharge of oil or a hazardous sub\u00ad stance into the navigable waters, the agency must immediately report the discharge to a State reasonably expected to be affected by the discharge. The section also increases the existing maximum penalties for violation of the notice requirement from $10,000 and one year imprisonment to $250,000 <$500,000 for an organization) and three years imprison\u00ad ment, with an increase to five years impris\u00ad onment for multiple convictions. Section 4301(b) increases the maximum penalties for the illegal discharge of oil or a hazardous substance under the Clean Water Act. The Coast Guard presently has the au\u00ad thority to assess a civil penalty of $5,000 for each offense. This authority is extended to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the penalties are in\u00ad creased to $25,000 for each day of the of\u00ad fense. The Administrator is currently authorized to commence a civil action against a person who discharges oil or hazardous substances. Section 430Hc> extends this authority to the Coast Guard as well. In addition, the new penalties are $1,000 per barrel of oil or hazardous substance discharged, or $5,000,000, whichever is less. In the case of willful negligence or willful misconduct, the penalty would be $5,000 per barrel spilled with no cap, instead of the existing penalty of $250,000. All penalties recovered by the United States would be deposited in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Penalties for violations of section 311(j), relating to removal of discharged oil or haz\u00ad ardous substances, local contingency plans, discharge prevention requirements, and vessel inspections, are increased from $5,000 to $25,000. Subsection (e) through (r) amend various sections of the United States Code to make the criminal penalty provisions consistent with the sentencing classification of of\u00ad fenses found in title 18 of the United States Code, and to generally increase the criminal penalties for violations of several Federal laws which affect the operation of vessels and facilities in U.S. waters. Subsection (e) increases the penalties for gross negligence in operating a vessel, in\u00ad cluding operating the vessel while intoxicat\u00ad ed, from $5,000 to $100,000 ($200,000 for an organization). Subsection (f) increases crimi\u00ad nal fines for infractions involving various in\u00ad spection requirements for vessels found in chapter 33 of title 46, United States Code. Subsection (g) increases fivefold the crimi\u00ad nal penalty for willfully violating require\u00ad ments imposed on vessels carrying liquid bulk dangerous cargoes to $250,000 ($500,000 for an organization). Load line re\u00ad quirement violations increased from tions) in subsection <h>. Criminal fines ing to complements of inspected vessels, watches, coastwise pilotage, and crew re\u00ad quirements are increased from $500 to $10,000 in subsections (i), (j), (k), m, and (m), respectively. Finally, subsection (1) in\u00ad creases criminal fines to of foreign commerce pilotage require\u00ad ments. Penalties for criminal violations under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act are strengthened in subsection <n> by increasing both the maximum term or imprisonment and the fine payable. Subsection (o) in\u00ad creases fines for vessel navigation require\u00ad ments relating to safety in marine regattas, marine parades, use of public and volunteer private vessels. The Intervention on the High Seas Act is amended by subsection (p) to increase fines from $10,000 to $100,000 Fines under the Deepwater Port Act are in\u00ad creased to $100,000 ($200,000 in the case of an organization>. Finally, subsection (r) amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which governs the implementation of the International Convention for the Pre\u00ad vention of Pollution from Ships <MARPOL) Protocol, by increasing the maximum proba\u00ad ble prison term to 10 years and the maxi\u00ad mum fine to $250,000. Sec. 4302-Deposit of certain penalties into oil spill liability trust fund. This section provides that the amounts re\u00ad covered by the Federal government for pen\u00ad alties assessed under section 311(b)(6) of the Clean Water Act are to be deposited in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Sec. 4303. Hazardous substances This section clarifies that this title is not intended to affect or modify the obligations or liabilities of a person under any other law for the discharge or release of hazardous substances, or pollutants, or contaminants, as defined in the Comprehensive Environ\u00ad mental Response, Compensation, and Liabil\u00ad ity Act. TITLE V-PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND OIL SPILL REMOVAL Sec. 5001-Short title. This section indicates that this title may be cited as the \"Prince William Sound Oil Spill Removal Act of 1989.\" Sec. 5002-Definitions. This section defines the terms \"arctic waters\", \"Prince William Sound\", and \"tank vessel\", used in this title. Sec. 5003-Tank vessel requirements. Section 5003 requires the Secretary within six months after the date of enactment of this Act, to issue regulations addressing escort vessels for tank vessels traveling within designated areas of Prince William Sound, and the use of Alaska State pilots on those tank vessels. The Committees note that, while reasona\u00ad ble discretion is given to the Secretary, the Committees intend that the Secretary should issue regulations requiring the use of at least one towing vessel or other escort vessel while a tank vessel is in Prince Wil\u00ad liam Sound. The Committees note that rep\u00ad resentatives of the oil industry are now using oil supply vessels as escort vessels, with a crew trained in oil spill removal and with spill removal equipment on board. The Committees believe that the Secretary should investigate this option. When requiring the use of pilots licensed by the state of Alaska, the bill requires that those pilots operate under their Federal li\u00ad censes. This is the current situation in Prince William Sound. The Committees sup\u00ad port this approach because the local knowl\u00ad edge and expertise of State-licensed pilots would be utilized. At the same time, the Committee intends that those pilots be re\u00ad sponsible to a Federal authority. Sec. 5004-Vessel traffic service system. Section 5004 requires the Secretary to pre\u00ad pare and implement a plan modifying sur\u00ad veillance coverage of vessels in Prince Wil\u00ad liam Sound. The Committees note that there is a history of concern over the extent of radar coverage in the Sound, in terms of both the areas of the Sound that are cov\u00ad ered by existing radar installations and the reliability and operational readiness of the radar units. The Committees expect the Secretary to address these problems. The plan under this section must be prepared within four months of the date of enact\u00ad ment of this Act, and implemented within one year. This section fulfills the Vessel Traffic Service System authorization re\u00ad quirement of section 4107 of this Act. Sec. 5005-Equipment and personnel re\u00ad quirements. Section 5005 requires that within 18 months of enactment of this Act, the Secre\u00ad tary must require specific removal equip\u00ad ment and personnel as part of a local con\u00ad tingency plan prepared for Prince William Sound under section 311(j) of the Clean Water Act. As noted above, the Committees have found the existing contingency plans to be wholly inadequate, especially in light of the nearly complete breakdown of remov\u00ad al capability during the first few days of the Exxon Valdez spill. These requirements in\u00ad clude: prepositioning of oil spill removal equipment; establishing an oil spill removal team in Prince William Sound; requiring tank vessels operating in the Sound to have appropriate equipment to remove a dis\u00ad charge of oil and minimize damage to the environment; training in oil spill contain\u00ad ment for local residents and the local fish\u00ad ing industry; and requiring practice exer\u00ad cises to test the effectiveness of the equip\u00ad ment and personnel under the contingency plan. The Committees expect the contingency plan to address matters such as ensuring that equipment is prepositioned at the most critical points of need, as addressed in con\u00ad tingency plans; that equipment must be ready for deployment at all times; and that the equipment be periodically inspected and tested in conjunction with oil spill removal team exercises. In addition, the Committees recognize the concerns expressed by tank vessel operators that deployment of oil spill removal equip\u00ad ment from a tank vessel by that vessel's crew is a dangerous undertaking. Therefore, while the Committees intend that for oil spill removal equipment carried on board tank vessels operating in Prince William Sound, that equipment should be used by an appropriate oil spill removal team. Sec. 5006-Use of local services. Section 5006 requires the Secretary to consult with local residents and local land-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26861 owners of the Prince William Sound area, and to the maximum extent feasible, use local expertise, services, equipment, and fa\u00ad cilities in carrying out the provisions of this title. As is often the case, local residents have intimate knowledge of the geography and ecology of Prince William Sound. Un\u00ad fortunately, little attention often is paid to local knowledge because it does not comport with scientific theories or with the way oil spill removal operations are conducted in other areas. The Secretary should take ad\u00ad vantage of this body of local knowledge to avoid exacerbating existing problems and to increase public support for the Secretary's activities. This is especially true in the case of Alaska Native corporations, which are the significant local landowners in the Prince William Sound area. Sec. 5007-Authority of State of Alaska. Section 5007 clarifies that this title does not change, diminish, or preempt any au\u00ad thority that the State of Alaska may have to regulate tank vessels or provide for oil spill contingency plans in State waters. This section does not provide any new authority to the State of Alaska or any of its political subdivisions; it merely emphasizes that ex\u00ad isting authority is not affected consisterit with legal precedent and court decisions. Further, the Committees recognize that the State of Alaska has imposed regulations on vessel operators in State waters that are similar to the requirements of this Act. In exercising responsibility under title V, the Secretary should examine those State regu\u00ad lations to ensure that, when possible, a single standard is imposed on vessel owners and operators. Sec. 5008-Environmental assessments. Section 5008 requires the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the Depart\u00ad ment of Commerce to spend no less than $5 million per year during fiscal years 1990 through 1992 to assess and monitor the ef\u00ad fects of the Exxon Valdez spill on the living marine resources of Prince William Sound. This section further requires the Secretary of Commerce, when possible, to recover the amounts expended from the owner or opera\u00ad tor of the Exxon Valdez. Any amounts re\u00ad covered are to be credited to the appropria\u00ad tions of the National Oceanic and Atmos\u00ad pheric Administration. In carrying out ac\u00ad tivities under this section, the Under Secre\u00ad tary is expected to consult with local resi\u00ad dents and significant local landowners of the Prince William Sound area; to coordi\u00ad nate monitoring and assessment work with the State of Alaska and the Prince William Sound Science and Technology Institute in Cordova, Alaska; and to utilize local services and expertise. As noted above, local knowl\u00ad edge, especially that of Alaska Native corpo\u00ad rations who are significant local landown\u00ad ers, is often invaluable and should be used to the maximum extent practicable. Sec. 5009-Report. Section 5009 requires the Secretary to report on all oil pollution exercises in the Port of Valdez and Prince William Sound during the operation of the Trans-Alaska pipeline, and any other matters the Secre\u00ad tary may deem appropriate. As a general matter, the Committee recognize that sever\u00ad al of the provisions of this title are much more specific than those in other portions of the Act. Should a conflict exist, the Com\u00ad mittees intend that these provisions should control for Prince William Sound. TITLE VI-MISCELLANEOUS Sec. 6001-Statutory waivers. This section narrows the existing author\u00ad ity to waive navigation and safety laws. The waiver authority would be limited to part B, which deals with inspection and regulation of vessels; part C, which deals with load lines of vessels; part F <except section 8103), which deals with manning of vessels; and part H, which deals with documentation of vessels. The amendment further clarifies that crises warranting waivers are limited to those involving national defense or dis\u00ad charges, or threats of discharges, of oil or hazardous substances into or on the naviga\u00ad ble waters or exclusive economic zone of the United States. This section authorizes the Secretary to grant a waiver on the Secretary's initiative, or at the request of the head of another de\u00ad partment, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government. A waiver granted under this section must state the reason for the waiver and state which requirements of law are being waived. In addition, the waiver must be for a speci\u00ad fied period of time, not to exceed one year, may not be renewed, and must terminate when qualified individuals or vessels are available. Subsection (b) is a conforming amend\u00ad ment that repeals the existing authority for waivers contained in the chapter 1 note of title 46, United States Code. Sec. 6002-Savings clause. This section clarifies that this Act does not affect admiralty and maritime law or the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States with respect to civil actions under admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, preserving to suitors in all cases other reme\u00ad dies to which they are otherwise entitled. This section is intended to clarify that this Act cannot supersede that provision, nor does it change the jurisdiction of the dis\u00ad trict courts under section 1333 of title 28, United States Code (the codified section of the Judiciary Act of 1789). Sec. 6003-Qualified authorizing legisla\u00ad tion. This section provides that this Act meets the requirements of section 4611<0<2><B> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as quali\u00ad fied legislation authorizing the collection of a tax on oil. TITLE VII-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Sec. 7001-0il pollution research and de\u00ad velopment program. <a> Interagency Coordinating Committee on oil pollution research. This subsection establishes an Interagen\u00ad cy Coordinating Committee on oil pollution research to coordinate research, develop\u00ad ment, and demonstration among the Feder\u00ad al agencies, industry, research institutions, and other nations. The Interagency Com\u00ad mittee is established to bring together the capabilities and expertise of the Federal agencies involved with oil spill research, and to ensure that each agency's activities are coordinated with an overall national re\u00ad search program and plan. The Chairman of the Interagency Committee would be ap\u00ad pointed by the President. A research plan would be submitted by the Interagency Committee within 120 days that would iden\u00ad tify agency roles and responsibilities, and re\u00ad search priorities. To provide an independent review of the adequacy of the research plan, section 7001(a)<4><B> directs that the research plan be prepared with the advice and guidance of the National Academy of Science and the National Institute of Standards and Tech\u00ad nology. (b) Oil pollution research and develop\u00ad ment program. (1) Establishment. The Interagency Com\u00ad mittee would coordinate the program estab\u00ad lished in this subsection for conducting oil pollution research and development. (2) Innovative oil pollution technology. New or improved technologies that would be effective in preventing or mitigating oil dis\u00ad charges and would protect the environment would be researched, developed, and demon\u00ad strated. The environmental effects of the use of these technologies to prevent or miti\u00ad gate oil discharges would be researched. The research would be done in consultation with the National Response Team to enhance government and industry ability to respond quickly to oil discharges. <3> Oil pollution technology evaluation. Technologies developed for the purposes of prevention or mitigation would be evaluated for their efficacy. The use of controlled field testing <where appropriate) to evaluate real-world application of oil discharge pre\u00ad vention or mitigation would also be support\u00ad ed through this program. <4> Oil pollution effects research. Re\u00ad search on the short-term and long-term en\u00ad vironmental effects of oil discharges would be performed. Improved models for predict\u00ad ing the fate, transport, and effects of oil dis\u00ad charges would be developed. Areas that are particularly sensitive and at risk to oil dis\u00ad charges would be identified and mapped. Baseline data would be gathered in areas sensitive and at risk to oil discharges to assist determination of effects following an oil discharge. Plans for long-term monitor\u00ad ing of areas sensitive and at risk would be developed for implementation in the event of a major spill. (5) Special studies. This subsection re\u00ad quires the Secretary of Commerce to estab\u00ad lish a 10-year comprehensive monitoring and research program to determine the long-term effects of the oil discharged by the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, and to in\u00ad vestigate the way to protect arctic and sub\u00ad arctic environment from the risk of oil transportation. This subsection also in\u00ad cludes a five-year research program to de\u00ad termine the environmental effects of recent oil spills in Rhode Island, Delaware, and Texas. < 6 > Marine simulation research. This sub\u00ad section provides for research on the greater use and application of geographic and ship simulation models. This research would ben\u00ad efit contingency planning, especially for specific geographic areas; removal and strike team training; and tanker vessel per\u00ad sonnel training. (c) Grants. This subsection allows the agencies represented on the Interagency Committee to enter into contracts and coop\u00ad erative agreements and make grants to uni\u00ad versities, research institutions, and other persons. (d) International cooperation. This sub\u00ad section directs the Interagency Committee to coordinate and cooperate with other na\u00ad tions and foreign research entities in con\u00ad ducting oil pollution research and develop\u00ad ment and demonstration activities, includ\u00ad ing controlled field tests of oil discharges. (e) Annual reports. The Chairman of the Interagency Committee is to submit to Con\u00ad gress at the close of each fiscal year a report on the activities carried out under this sec\u00ad tion in the preceding fiscal year, and on ac\u00ad tivities proposed to be carried out under this section in the current fiscal year. (f) Regional research centers. A minimum of six regional oil pollution research and de\u00ad velopment centers would be established in each of six regions: tropical and subtropical 26862 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 coastal environments of Florida and coastal environments of the Gulf Coast, Atlantic temperate coastal environments, Pacific temperate coastal environments, the Alas\u00ad kan coastline and other arctic and subarctic environments, the Great Lakes, and inland waters. The regional centers would design and implement a research program and strategy for dealing with major oil spills, taking into account the various regional ele\u00ad ments that may affect oil spill effects and response. (g) Funding. There would be authorized $28 million from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to be appropriated annually without fiscal year limitation to carry out section 7001. The bill authorizes $1 million from the Fund for each regional research center, for each of the five fiscal years be\u00ad ginning in 1990. TITLE VIII-PROVISIONS RELATING TO ALASKA OIL Sec. 8001-Trans-Alaska pipeline fund. Subsections (a) and (b) make clarifying amendments to section 204 of the Trans\u00ad Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act <TAPA, 43 U.S.C. 1653). Section 204(b) of TAPA is amended to clarify the liability of pipeline right-of-way holders for oil pollution. Sec\u00ad tion 204(b) currently provides that permit holders who cause oil pollution \"within or without the right-of-way or permit area\" shall be liable for the total cost of removal for a spill occurring anywhere in the world. That clearly was not the intention of this section. Rather, it was intended to cover oil pollution in the vicinity of the pipeline right-of-way or permit areas in Alaska. Sub\u00ad section <b><2> will clarify that the removal liability of the permit holder extends only to activities relating directly to the Trans\u00ad Alaska pipeline. Subsection (b)(3) extends payment of removal costs to those incurred by State officials. Finally, subsection (b)(4) makes the TAPA removal liability provi\u00ad sions inapplicable to those situations where this Act applies. In all other instances, the provisions in TAP A relating to removal costs and liability remain in effect. Section (c) repeals that subsection of TAPA which established a liability and com\u00ad pensation fund for damages caused by oil spills from vessels transporting oil from the pipeline terminus to ports elsewhere in the United States. This repeal does not affect the ability of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Li\u00ad ability Fund <T APLF) to pay any claims outstanding at the date of enactment of this Act. However, after enactment of the Oil Pollution Act of 1989, any discharges of Trans-Alaska pipeline oil into the navigable waters of the U.S., the adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone after the date of enactment of this Act will be cov\u00ad ered by this Act and claims paid through the Fund implemented by this Act. Subsection <c><2><A> defines the term \"damages\" compensable under TAPA, with retroactive application to January 1, 1989. Subparagraph (B) provides that TAPLF will pay a valid claim within 90 days of present\u00ad ment of the claim, including the first $14 million otherwise compensable from the re\u00ad sponsible party for the spill. After payment of the claim, T APLF is subrogated to all rights of any person entitled to recover under TAPA, subject to applicable limits of liability. This provision will provide prompt compensation to those who have been dam\u00ad aged by spills of trans-Alaska pipeline oil, such as those from the Exxon Valdez and Glacier Bay. Subsection <d> directs the President to conduct a study and make recommendations for the disposition of any amounts remain\u00ad ing in TAPLF, after payment of all claims. Subsection (e) preserves all Tucker Act claims for contributors to TAPLF. The Tucker Act gives the U.S. Court of Claims jurisdiction to adjudicate any questions of an unconstitutional taking of property asso\u00ad ciated with the disposition of the TAPLF. Subsection (f) provides that all TAPLF of\u00ad ficers and trustees, both private and public as well as present and former, will not be subject to liability in those capacities except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, TAPLF will indemnify those of\u00ad ficers or trustees for all claims and liabil\u00ad ities, including legal costs associated with any claim or liability. Sec. 8002-Effective date. This section provides that title VIII is ef\u00ad fective on the commencement date, as that term is defined by section 4611(0(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. COMMUNICATION FROM HON. BILL SCHUETTE, MEMBER OF CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following com\u00ad munication from the Honorable BILL SCHUETTE, Member of Congress: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Washington , DC, October 31, 1989. MR. SPEAKER: On August 3, 1989, I notified you pursuant to Rule L (50) of the Rules of the House that I had been served with a subpoena duces tecum issued by the Superi\u00ad or Court for the State of New Jersey. After consultation with the General Counsel to the clerk, I have determined that compliance with the subpoena is consistent with the privileges and precedents of the House. Sincerly, BILL SCHUETTE, Member of Congress. THE PRICE OF IMMIGRATION: IS AMERICA FOR SALE? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from Nebraska [Mr. BEREUTER] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BEREUTER. Madam Speaker, for over a century the Statue of Liber\u00ad ty has stood as a symbol of the United States of America and an expression of freedom to people throughout the world. At the base of the Lady Liberty are the famous lines of Emma Lazarus. These words have come to symbolize America's status as a generous land where those who have suffered from oppression and injustice can come and begin life anew. According to Emma Lazarus: \"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she With silent lips, \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\" Madam Speaker, this Member has carefully examined Emma Lazarus' poem, and nowhere can I find the words \"Give me a million bucks.\" But that is precisely what is being pro\u00ad posed in the other body of Congress. According to Senate bill 358; foreign nationals with $1 million will be enti\u00ad tled to their piece of the American dream. If the other body has its way, 4,800 foreign \"fat cats\" would be per\u00ad mitted to buy their way into American citizenship, contingent upon their em\u00ad ployment of 10 American workers for at least 2 years. As a consolation prize for those who don't quite qualify for \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,\" 2,000 special visas would be granted for those able to plop down one-half million dollars in farming or ranching. If the other body has its way, this Nation will clearly be forced to recon\u00ad sider its status as leader of the free world. In her poem, Emma Lazarus rejected the pretensions and corruption of the Old World with the cry, \"Keep your storied pomp!\" In Senate bill 358 the other body would seem to be saying \"Give us your storied pomp!\"-if they bring plenty of money. Madam Speaker, this is not a trivial matter. This Member believes the issue goes to the heart of what we, as Americans , and our Nation are all about. This Member would deeply regret to learn that our principles, our values, and indeed American citizen\u00ad ship itself, is for sale to the highest bidder. One day soon this body may be asked to make that decision. It is the sincere hope of this Member that we reject the practice of examining an ap\u00ad plicant's wallet size when considering requests for permanent residency. Madam Speaker, I am including an article in the September 4 edition of Business Week. I commend this essay to my colleagues, and urge them to fully consider the implications of the other body's proposal. GIVE ME YOUR RICH, YOUR VERY RICH-A SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL WOULD GRANT SPECIAL PREFERENCE TO MILLIONAIRES <By Douglas A. Harbrecht) Americans have a special reverence for the Statue of Liberty. She has symbolized a fresh start and unbounded opportunity to generations of immigrants, from the waves of Germans and Irish in the 19th century to the millions of illegal aliens granted amnes\u00ad ty by the sweeping 1986 immigration reform bill. Not surprisingly, a U.S. immigration visa possesses a similar talismanic power-a power no one ever thought to put a price on. Until now. If the Senate has its way, getting a U.S. visa could depend on the size of a would-be immigrant's bank account. When Congress returns from its August recess, the House will take up a Senate-passed measure that, for the first time, would let wealthy foreign\u00ad ers buy their way into the U.S. as perma\u00ad nent residents. The price for a chunk of the American dream: a cool $1 million. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26863 RURAL REBATE The bill, crafted by Senators Edward M. Kennedy <D-Mass.) and Alan K. Simpson <R-Wyo.) , would create \"special prefer\u00ad ences\" for 4,800 well-heeled immigrants. They would have to prove that they have the money and promise to invest it in a new business that would employ at least 10 American workers for two years. A discount would be granted to those who would move to a hard-pressed rural area, courtesy of an amendment by Senator Phil Gramm <R-Tex.). It carves out an additional 2,000 special visas for rich immigrants who bring $500,000 with them and promise to put it into raising cattle, growing soybeans, or some other business in a sparsely popu\u00ad lated locale. This curious sort of \"Buy America\" provi\u00ad sion is a little-noted aspect of the first major overhaul of immigration quotas in 24 years. And it stands a good chance of be\u00ad coming law, since the overall measure has broad support. The Senate approved it 81- 17 in July. House passage seems likely some\u00ad time next year. While they disagree widely on specifics , most business and labor groups welcome changes in the quota system, an issue not addressed by the 1986 law. The basic goal is tilting preferences away from the current emphasis on reuniting families toward en\u00ad suring a pool of immigrants with needed skills. The measure creates 150,000 visas over three years, to be awarded under a point system that gives the highest priority to the young, the well-educated, and those trained in such high-demand occupations as science and engineering <table). That's not controversial. But the new spe\u00ad cial visas for millionaires have set off an emotional debate over the trade-off between economic incentives and American values. \"It's disgusting,\" says Garry Turner of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which wants to lower immigration ceilings. Adds Senator Dale Bumpers <D\u00ad Ark.), who led an unsuccessful, 43-56 at\u00ad tempt to kill the provision on the Senate floor: \"We are putting the crassest commer\u00ad cial value on American citizenship I have ever seen.\" But this revulsion isn't shared by the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. and the international business groups that are among the bill's most enthusiastic backers. They see the visa-for-investment swap as a way to enhance U.S. competitiveness at no cost to the taxpayer. \"Hey, we're talking about providing jobs for our country,\" says Polly A. Webber, a San Jose <Calif.) immi\u00ad lawyer who is of the AILA. \"The [newcomers] pledge their alle\u00ad giance to the country, and we give them a stake in their investment. Many states are really desperate for this injection of addi\u00ad tional income.\" MIXED FEELING The Senate action hasn't escaped world attention. American banks are hawking the measure in hopes of luring Hong Kong in\u00ad vestors skittish about the coming Chinese takeover of the colony. But the measure's appeal isn't limited to legitimate capitalists. Despite vehement denials by backers of the measure, critics worry that it will attract drug lords and shadowy pre'er-do-wells to U.S. visa offices. The controversy will soon be taken up in the House, where immigration subcommit\u00ad tee Chairman Bruce A. Morrison <D-Conn.) confesses to mixed feelings. The idea of buying your way into America while the rest of the world waits in line \"leaves a bad taste in my mouth,\" says Morrison. But, he adds, \"there is a lot of foreign investing going on right now. Who do you want, someone who puts down roots or just puts down his money?\" It used to be that penniless immigrants came to America to make their fortunes. Now, the rich may soon be invited to invest them. So much for wretched refuse and huddled masses yearning to breathe free. NEW THINKING ON IMMIGRATION The bill moving through Congress would: Expand the number of visas to 630,000, up from 406,000. Set aside 4,800 visas for immigrants who bring at least $1 million into the country and create new jobs. Reserve 150,000 residency visas for immi\u00ad grants who posses PhDs, will provide rural medical services, or offer other special skills. Grant preference to Chinese students in the U.S. who could face persecution at home. Increase visas allotted to Hong Kong resi\u00ad dents. Ban deportation of immediate relatives of aliens granted amnesty. Guarantee 480,000 visas for immediate rel\u00ad atives of U.S. citizens and residents with permanent visas. 0 1900 INTRODUCTION OF ADMINIS\u00ad TRATION'S HUD REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mrs. KENNELLY). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. GONZALEZ] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GONZALEZ. Madam Speaker, today I have introduced by request, to\u00ad gether with our distinguished ranking minority member, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. WYLIE], and the ranking minority member of the Subcommit\u00ad tee on Housing and Community Devel\u00ad opment, the gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. RouKEMA], the adminis\u00ad tration's legislative proposals to reform the Department of Housing and Urban Development; that is, the Secretary of HUD's reform proposals. It is now known as H.R. 3570. During the past year we have been witnesses to the unfolding of one scan\u00ad dal after another relating to the ad\u00ad ministration of HUD during the 8 years that Secretary Samuel Pierce was the Secretary of HUD. Numerous hearings, investigations, and oversight of HUD have occurred this year. A new HUD Secretary has come into the office intent on reforming the manner in which the Department has been run. Secretary Jack Kemp has appeared before our Housing and Community Development Subcommit\u00ad tee on three occasions thus far this year since taking office in early Febru\u00ad ary, and has been forthright and honest in his assessment of what has gone wrong at HUD. The legislation that I am introduc\u00ad ing today with my Republican col\u00ad leagues embodies Secretary Kemp's recommendations to change the way in which HUD has been operating in the last 8 years. I am introducing this administration's legislative proposal in the same spirit that I introduced President Bush's savings and loan reform package in January of this year. While I am not committed to all of the proposals in Secretary Kemp's package, I am pleased to introduce this administration's proposal so that we on the Committee on Banking, Fi\u00ad nance and Urban Affairs can give it the careful consideration that we gave the savings and loan legislation that the administration submitted actually in February. I believe that all of the members of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and on its Subcom\u00ad mittee on Housing and Community Development share my intention to see that HUD is run by honest and dedicated people. However, legislative\u00ad ly there is not a thing we can do about compelling honesty among administra\u00ad tors. Those portions of the Secretary's reform package that have to do with specific legislative recommendations are what are encompassed in the bill we introduced today. Over 65 percent of the Secretary's recommendations are in areas that he and his adminis\u00ad tration supporting him can bring about administratively without the need for any legislative enactments or bills. I believe that Secretary Kemp's pro\u00ad posal is going to be substantially en\u00ad acted. Some of the members of the Subcommittee on Housing and Com\u00ad munity Development have introduced reform bills. The gentleman from New York [Mr. SCHUMER], the gentlewom \u00ad an from New Jersey [Mrs. RouKEMA], and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. WYLIE], have introduced reform pack\u00ad ages. But we were waiting to have the specific recommendations from Secre\u00ad tary Kemp so that we could evaluate and add to, or in the amendatory proc\u00ad esses of what we call markup of the subcommittee bring about the will of the substantive committee, the legisla\u00ad tive committee, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Develop\u00ad ment. There will be additions, there will be deletions. That is part of our process. Madam Speaker, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Develop\u00ad ment has already commenced its markup consideration of this year's housing authorization proposals that will include recommendations to reform HUD. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. REMARKS BY ARNOLD I. BURNS TO BOYS' CLUB OF AMERICA'S CONGRESSIONAL BREAKFAST The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mrs. KENNELLY). Under a previous order of 26864 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 the House, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. MICHEL] is recognized for 5 min\u00ad utes. Mr. MICHEL. Madam Speaker, Arnold I. Burns, former Deputy Attorney General of the United States, recently spoke on the subject of the importance of Boys Club. I recommend his incisive and touching speech to my col\u00ad leagues. At this point, I insert in the RECORD a speech by Arnold I. Burns, delivered at Boys Club of America's Congressional Breakfast, Washington, DC, September 27, 1989, as fol\u00ad lows: REMARKS BY ARNOLD I. BURNS Good morning. We are gathered here this morning to celebrate and honor five \"Youth of the Year\" finalists. These outstanding young leaders have performed a wide array of valuable services in their Clubs and com\u00ad munities. Anthony, James, John, Felix and Brent-I salute you for giving generously of your time, talents and energy to help family, friends and neighbors. I applaud you for your exceptional dedication to high moral principles. You have distinguished your\u00ad selves among your peers by exhibiting a strong and healthy attitude toward life and work, and your good deeds have made a vital contribution to the improvement of our society. How I wish that all young people had such strong and healthy attitudes! And how I wish that good physical and mental health were characteristic of all American society. Unfortunately, this is not the case. No, I cannot, in good conscience, give a clean bill of health to America. Disease runs rampant in our inner cities. It is a disease of the spirit that cripples and kills. Our inner cities are plagued by crime, drugs and violence. There is an epidemic of illiteracy, illegitimacy, filth and poverty. And poverty spawns hunger, homelessness, frustration, anger and despair. Kids growing up in our cities don't know how to break the cycle of poverty, failure and more poverty. They don't know where to turn for help. They need emergency treatment. But who will cure their ills? Today, I would like to examine the health of America's young people and check their vital signs. As the examination proceeds, I will discuss the symptomology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of our inner city boys and girls. So, if you will bear with me while I put on my doctor's uniform, we'll begin this important examination. Good morning. I'm Dr. Burns, Chief Inter\u00ad nist and Director of Emergency Medicine at D.C. General Hospital. At 2:03 a.m., a 16-year-old boy was admit\u00ad ted to the hospital by a police officer. The officer found the patient wounded on the street after being caught in cross-fire during a drug deal gone sour. The patient spoke mostly in Spanish, and Dr. Carmen Rodriguez, a resident here at the hospital, helped me take a brief history. In taking the history, I learned that the patient has no father and that his immedi\u00ad ate family consists of four brothers and sis\u00ad ters who are being raised by his mother. The patient ran away from home when he was 14. He has spent most of the last two years on the streets and is a member of a street gang. I first examined the puncture wound to the right thigh that the patient received during the gun fight. Bone fragments and tearing of tendons were evident, along with resultant weakness beyond the injury to the lower extremity. As the examination proceeded, I observed needle marks in both ante-cubital fossa and inflammation and excoriation in the nasal passages, indicating heroine and cocaine use. There was also questionable jaundice in the eyes and a fine tremor in the hands. The patient had old scarring on his back and was missing several teeth. Hospital records obtained when the patient was ad\u00ad mitted to the emergency room four years ago indicate that he had been physically abused during childhood. The case had been referred to a social worker at the time, but was never pursued. The patient weighs 103 pounds and is short of stature-only 5 feet, 2 inches tall. He is thin, and loose musculature of the ab\u00ad domen raises the possibility of malnutrition. Hematologic studies indicate an increased MCV <mean corpuscular volume) raising the possibility of ethanol abuse. Chemistries in\u00ad dicate elevated liver enzymes which support this indication and which also strongly sug\u00ad gest hepatitis. I ordered further hematolog\u00ad ic studies to rule out the possibility of AIDS. The patient was then examined by Dr. Greenberg, head of the psychiatric unit, who filed a report indicating severe depres\u00ad sion with suicidal tendencies, extreme anxi\u00ad ety, fear and feelings of inferiority. In Dr. Greenberg's opinion, the patient tried to stifle these feelings by using illegal drugs and alcohol. Use of illegal drugs, in turn, ex\u00ad plains why the patient was shot in cross-fire during a drug deal and, consequently, why the patient has an injury to the right thigh. What, then, is the clinical diagnosis of the various symptoms exhibited by the patient? In summary, the diagnosis I believe to be most inclusive and accurate is acute and abject neglect by family and society. I would like to point out that this diagno\u00ad sis is not unusual among inner city teen\u00ad agers. This case is not at all atypical. Today almost two-thirds of all high school seniors have tried illegal drugs. By the 12th grade, 80 percent of all boys and girls are periodic drinkers. Each year, more than 1 million teenagers become pregnant. Remember, more than 14 million youngsters live in pov\u00ad erty. Acute neglect is a condition that hampers and cripples millions of girls and boys each year. What is my prescription for the ail\u00ad ments afflicting our youngsters? The most successful way to treat them, in my opinion, is memberhip in a Boys & Girls Club. Clubs provide a secure environment for young people at-risk of drug and alcohol abuse, premature sexual involvement and juvenile crime. By providing a safe place for young people to do, Clubs help disadvantaged boys and girls \"beat the streets.\" Clubs give young people a chance to develop self\u00ad esteem and the social skills they need to become productive members of society. Most clubs are located in neighborhoods where drugs, crime and poverty are every\u00ad day facts of life. Who belongs to Boys & Girls Clubs? Sixty-six percent of our mem\u00ad bers come from families earning $15,000 per year or less; 77 percent are from families with three or more children; 51 percent are from minority families; 47 percent are from single-parent families, and 29 percent are from families receiving public assistance. The Club frequently is the only place in the neighborhood where kids can play and learn under the supervision of a trained, profes\u00ad sional adult. Clubs help their members stay out of trouble with the law, and Club staff become \"second parents\" to many boys and girls who often turn to them for advice and guid\u00ad ance. Boys & Girls Clubs serve over 1 mil\u00ad lion boys and 300,000 girls in over 1,100 Club units operated by nearly 600 locally-gov\u00ad erned organizations. A total of 56,434 Board and program volunteers help to make the Boys & Girls Club Movement work, and 15,525 full-and part-time staff members enable Clubs to provide youth development services on a daily basis. The care, concern and understanding that young people re\u00ad ceive from the Club staff foster trust and the development of sound values. Research supports this mode of treat\u00ad ment. A 1986 survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for Boys Clubs of America revealed that nearly 70 percent of all alumni believe they were kept away from drugs and alcohol due to involvement in their Clubs. Three out of four alumni be\u00ad lieve their experience at the Club helped them to avoid difficulty with the law. And nine out of 10 alumni feel that being in a Club had a positive effect on their lives, gave them skills for leadership, helped them get along with others, and influenced their success in later life. Former Club members who felt they had started life with the most obstacles to over\u00ad come-blacks, Hispanics, the economically disadvantaged and those from tough neigh\u00ad borhoods-gave their Club the most credit for their success as adults. Yes, the care, concern and understanding that young people find at the Boys & Girls Club cure many ills of our inner cities. These positive qualities lead boys and girls to the threshold of health and strength of character. What, then, is the prognosis for millions of children suffering from abandonment and neglect? This, my friends, will depend largely upon what we as a nation and as a society choose to do about the situation. The prognosis can be very good if we make the concerns of our young people a national priority. Boys & Girls Clubs already look after 1,300,000 youngsters. By 1991, at the conclusion of our Outreach '91 program, we will be caring for an additional 700,000 boys and girls, bringing the total number of youth served to 2 million. A good prognosis also requires that we practice preventive and holistic medicine. It is truly said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Our top priority is to expand drug prevention education. Some people foolishly think that the drug prob\u00ad lem is a Colombian problem or a Burmese problem or a Laotian problem. It is not. It is an American problem. So long as our citi\u00ad zens are willing to buy and use drugs, we will have drugs reaching our markets. We must-we must-dry up the market. We have got to change our peoples' attitudes about drugs-the way we have about alco\u00ad hol. We've got to take casual users out of the marketplace by arresting and publicly ostracizing them. And we must instill in our children a full understanding of drugs and offer them a viable, exciting, fufilling sub\u00ad stitute for idleness, drugs and then crime. Making our young people healthy again is going to take a massive, collaborative effort on the part of many youth service organiza\u00ad tions, private enterprise, and government at the city, state and federal levels. Some fed\u00ad eral agencies have stepped up to the plate and joined with us in our war on drugs: Terry Donahue of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Dr. Elaine Johnson of the Office of Substance November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26865 Abuse Prevention, and Jane Kenney of the Action Agency. These individuals and agencies have joined and financially supported our efforts in public housing. They have helped provide alternatives, as we convince kids to say No to drugs. The FBI's demand reduction unit has joined forces with Boys Clubs of America to develop after-school initiatives focusing on high-risk youth. We all know this war cannot be won until the demand for drugs decreases. The FBI working with local Boys & Girls Clubs will make a difference. We need a determined effort to stem the epidemic of despair that plagues America's young people. Happily, Americans know how to come to the aid of each other, and we know how to fight disease when it at\u00ad tacks the health and well-being of our chil\u00ad dren. If we band together, we can win the war on drugs, we can win the war on pover\u00ad ty, and we can win the war on crime! Ladies and gentlemen, let me close by re\u00ad minding you that there is more to medicine than just needles, pills and incisions. Love needs to be a fundamental part of the heal\u00ad ing process. How great it would be if every disadvan\u00ad taged boy and girl could receive enough love and affection to restore his or her health and vitality. Remember, our children need us. When just one child suffers, the pain is felt by many people. But when millions of children are hurting, our whole nation is at\u00ad risk. Let us not be afraid to show our love and concern, and let us resolve here and now to give more of our time, our talents and our treasure to help our children recuperate and get back on the road to good health. Believe me, your kindness will be repaid many times over. In this way, you, too, can experience some of the same satisfaction that doctors and nurses feel. For when people help others who are injured and who are in need, they also help themselves and all humanity. Thank you. U.S.S. \"LEXINGTON\" ACCIDEN';r The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from Florida [Mr. HUTTO] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUTTO. Madam Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I address Con\u00ad gress and the Nation regarding the tragedy which occurred aboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Lexington on Sunday, October 29, 1989. Words cannot properly express the sympathy we all extend to the loved ones of the five people who lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families, and I wish a speedy recovery to those who received injuries in that unfortunate incident. The tragic accident occurred when a young pilot based out of the Navy's air station near Meridian, MS, ap\u00ad proached at a wrong angle while at\u00ad tempting his first touch-and-go land\u00ad ing. The training jet, a two-seater T-2 Buckeye, crashed into the ship's su\u00ad perstructure, cartwheeled and then collided with several planes on the flight deck as it burst into flames. At the time, the Lexington was conduct\u00ad ing a training mission in the Gulf of Mexico about 30 miles south of Pensa\u00ad cola. Capt. Flack Logan, skipper of the Lady Lex, and his crew are to be com\u00ad mended for their professionalism in handling the accident. The fire ignited by aviation fuel was quickly contained, and the crew acted promptly and with precision to prevent more extensive damage to the ship. We should all be proud of their exemplary action in the face of adversity. This tragedy occurred aboard a ship which has served her country well for many years. The Lexington was com\u00ad missioned on February 17, 1943, and was responsible for destroying over 1 million tons of shipping and more than 1,000 enemy planes during World War II. Tokyo Rose called the Lady Lex the \"Blue Ghost\" because of nu\u00ad merous reports of her sinking only to return to battle painted a blue-grey color which was different from the camouflage coloring of other naval vessels. Now, it is the Navy's only air\u00ad craft carrier used exclusively for train\u00ad ing. It has been homeported in Pensa\u00ad cola since 1962. During my 11 years in Congress, I cannot recall a serious accident of any kind aboard the Lex until this one. De\u00ad spite thousands of takeoffs and land\u00ad ings every year, the ship maintains an excellent safety record which is a trib\u00ad ute to her crew and the Navy. The five who died in the Lexington accident will be remembered as brave and patriotic individuals. In addition to the pilot, Esn. Steven Pontell of Co\u00ad lumbia, MD, they were Airman Lisa Mayo of Oklahoma City, Aviation Boatswain's Mate Burnett Kilgore of Holly Springs, MS, and Timmy Gar\u00ad routte of Memphis. The fifth was a ci\u00ad vilian maintenance worker, Byron Courvelle, from Meridian, MS. Since damages were not severe, the Lexington is expected to be back in op\u00ad eration in the near future. Although the sorrow of this recent tragedy will linger for some time to come, we look forward to this proud lady, the Lady Lex, returning to the seas and continu\u00ad ing her service to our country as young pilots are trained for the U.S. Navy. ANNEXATION CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE RA\u00ad VENSWOOD-LAKE VIEW HIS\u00ad TORICAL ASSOCIATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from Illinois [Mr. ANNUNZIO] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ANNUNZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise to call to the attention of my colleagues that on October 21, 1989, the communities of Ra\u00ad venswood and Lake View, in the 11th Con\u00ad gressional District of Illinois, which I am hon\u00ad ored to represent, celebrated their 1 OOth year of annexation to the city of Chicago. To mark this occasion, a successful parade was held on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, and Richard C. Bjorklund, cochairman of the annexation cen\u00ad tennial committee, addressP.d the crowd in at\u00ad tendance. I would like to take this opportunity to share Cochairman Bjorklund's remarks regarding this annexation centennial celebration. The text of his timely and cogent remarks follows: CHICAGO AND LAKE VIEW: A CENTURY TOGETHER One hundred years ago we became dual citizens, citizens of the City of Chicago as well as of our own neighborhoods. It was in October, 1889, that the Illinois Supreme Court finally confirmed annex\u00ad ation to Chicago of the City of Lake View, the Village of Hyde Park, the Town of Lake and Jefferson Township, now the vast Northwest Side of Chicago. For residents of Lake View and the other areas, annexation meant improved water fa\u00ad cilities and sewerage, better police and fire protection, consolidated schools and fewer governmental agencies to bicker about. For the City of Chicago, annexation meant taking its place as the nation's second city after New York as well as the opportunity to grow finally into the great\u00ad est city in mid-America. Annexation put the city in closer touch with the workforce that would build its commerce and industry. And not incidental\u00ad ly, annexation provided Chicago with a greater tax base. Annexation gave Chicago a larger, brighter image to present for the World's Columbian Exposition that was to come in 1893, an exposition that lifted the city to world-class status. Scholars call Annexation Day one of the most important events in Chicago's history. We who are here to celebrate the centennial of annexation must agree. There have been great beneficial effects from annexation for the city and for the communities that joined it 100 years ago. Consider that we now have a working, in\u00ad tegrated transportation system that con\u00ad nects all parts of the metropolitan area. Consider that we have an unbroken lake\u00ad front more than 20 miles in length. Consid\u00ad er, too, that we enjoy numerous cultural and recreational advantages of big-city life. We live today in one of the richest resi\u00ad dential and commercial areas in the world. Property values in Lake View, Ravenswood, Uptown and Edgewater (the communities of Lake View Township) are among the high\u00ad est in the nation, thanks in large part to nature and to efforts of good people who lived here before us. In the next century we must make city life work all over again. We must make it work despite daunting challenges. We have an aging infrastructure that must be re\u00ad built. Our housing stock must be improved and maintained. Rusting industries must be replaced by new technology. Our health\u00ad care system must be constantly updated, and it must be extended to all who need it. Schools must be made adequate for the de\u00ad mands of the 21st Century. Social services must be expanded and modified, especially to meet the needs of newcomers among us. And, yes, we have a continuing crime prob\u00ad lem that must be controlled. We can make city life continue to work for us only if we meet the responsibilities of our dual citizenship. We must act in the bold \"I will\" spirit of Chicago to meet problems of the future, and we must do our duty with the sense of compassion that is the heritage of Lake View and all true neighborhoods. 26866 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 PAUL GUERRERO, JR., DAY IN DALLAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from Texas [Mr. BRYANT] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BRYANT. Madam Speaker, Sunday, No\u00ad vember 5, 1989, has been designated \"Paul Guerrero, Jr., Day\" in the city of Dallas and Dallas County, TX. It is an honor that Paul Guerrero, Jr., who would have been 58 on Sunday, richly de\u00ad served. His contributions as a professional musician and educator enriched his audiences in ballrooms, concert halls, living rooms, and classrooms throughout the country. Paul Guerrero, Jr., who died on March 3, 1989, will be honored at a reception, dedica\u00ad tion, and performance at Dallas' new Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, where the west dress circle stairway will bear his name. He was born in New Braunfels, TX, on No\u00ad vember 5, 1931, grew up in Dallas, and grad\u00ad uated from Sunset High School in 1953. As a young man he performed with the family band headed by his father and began playing pro\u00ad fessionally at the age of 14 on live radio broadcasts with recording star Judy Canova. After his military service during which he was a member of the Army Band at Fort Sam Houston, he earned his bachelor of arts, mas\u00ad ter's, and doctorate degrees in music from the University of North Texas. In the early 1960's, Paul Guerrero, Jr., was a founding member of the now-famous One O'Clock Lab Band at the University of North Texas, from which he was selected for an un\u00ad precedented 2 consecutive years as first col\u00ad legiate jazz drummer at the prestigious Notre Dame Jazz Festival. Music and teaching and family were Paul Guerrero's life. He was a nationally renowned jazz drum\u00ad mer. And he played with the best-Woody Herman, Stan Kenton, Henry Mancini, the Fifth Dimension, Vicki Carr, and Dean Martin. The World's Greatest Music was what he called his own band, which lived up to its name in numerous jazz festivals and various Dallas area jazz clubs, including an 8-year stint at the Bagatelle. Paul Guerrero, Jr., was the first jazz drum\u00ad mer to play with the Dallas Symphony Orches\u00ad tra, figuring prominently in its recording of \"The Dallas Sound,\" and served on the sym\u00ad phony's board of directors from 1980 through 1984. In 1975, Paul Guerrero, Jr., joined the staff of Richland College, where he taught percus\u00ad sion and music theory and directed the Rich\u00ad land Jazz Band and the Percussion Ensemble. He served on the Arts Magnet High School Advisory Board and designed its highly re\u00ad garded jazz curriculum. Paul Guerrero, Jr.'s contribution to our Na\u00ad tion's musical heritage and to the education of generations of American musicians is incalcu\u00ad lable. His family, friends, and community will cele\u00ad brate his life and his music with the music he loved, performed by Galen Jester and the Dallas Jazz Orchestra, the Richland Early Brass, and the University of North Texas One O'Clock Lab Band. It is fitting that someone who gave so much of himself and his talents to his community and his country will be honored with a very special observance on a very special day\u00ad Paul Guerrero, Jr., Day in Dallas. VACATION OF SPECIAL ORDER AND REQUEST FOR SPECIAL ORDER Mr. DORNAN of California. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to vacate my 60-minute special order for later on tonight, and ask for a 5- minute special order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. ABORTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tleman from California [Mr. DORNAN] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DORNAN of California. Madam Speaker, last week on the evening of the vote on abortion, where the Presi\u00ad dent's veto of the Health and Human Services appropriations bill was sus\u00ad tained, I had an hour special order. An acquaintance, a news media friend, called and asked if I would cut short my special order so that C-Span cam\u00ad eras that cover this House could divert to coverage of a dinner. I did not know it was a roast, but it was a dinner, a so\u00ad called roast of Bob Novak. And al\u00ad though I would have graciously even gone to that dinner, let alone tried to be courteous, I was told it was for spina bifida, which is a terrible birth defect for young children, and it is cer\u00ad tainly a worthy cause, so I cut my spe\u00ad cial order from 60 minutes down to about 10 minutes or so. But I had not bothered to check with the Members who followed me, and they went ahead with their special orders. So my giving up 50 minutes or so of time was all to no avail. D 1910 Well, I said I would take out a spe\u00ad cial order this week. I have had a lot of pro-life-interested people across the country call and ask me to please finish out that other 50 minutes on a postmortem of what really took place in that vote where 191 Members of this House, far more than was needed-we only needed 146 or one\u00ad third of the House plus 1-to sustain a Presidential veto, or a third of the Senator plus 1, 34. We easily got that in this House, but the debate rages on because the next day, the Friday, the President vetoed the District of Co\u00ad lumbia appropriations bill because my language, the Dornan pro-life lan\u00ad guage, had been taken out of the bill. I came down to this very lectern the day we debated that some weeks ago and read the letter from the President saying that he would veto the District of Columbia appropriations if it ended current law which has been in effect since midyear of 1988, and opened the floodgates to 9 months of abortion on demand in this beautiful Federal city. It was very clear to everybody, to the chairman and all the Members of this Chamber who voted, that the President would keep his word, and he did. Now it is being characterized as somehow or other a vote against poor women or young women who find themselves pregnant. What the Presi\u00ad dent is doing is respecting the view\u00ad point of those in this country who feel that abortion is the killing of innocent human life, the murdering of innocent human life if the conscience is formed in such a way that they personally be\u00ad lieve it is a human being in there but say \"go ahead and kill it, anyway.\" But I always try to use the word \"killing,\" which is a more generic word, because it does not involve con\u00ad science. But it certainly involves medi\u00ad cal fact. Killing an embryo, killing a fetus, killing a near-full-term-delivery child is killing a living person, a living human being. So that if you leave it alone and the continuum takes place, you have a person, an entity, an existing human being. More than, or almost half, the time it is of a different gender from the mother, a different physical struc\u00ad ture. The tiniest of women can be giving birth to a 6-foot-7 potential linebacker or a concert pianist or a lady who is going to become a great research doctor like Madam Curie, and instead of developing radium, could conquer cancer, find a cure for AIDS. We never know what we are doing when we snuff out the potential of that human life in the womb. Well, the President kept his word on the health and human services appro\u00ad priation bill, he kept his word on the D.C. appropriations bill. Now we are meeting in this House trying to figure out where we go from here. Well, may I propose to the rest of my liberal colleagues in the House the following analogy: When you say the initials NRA, which mean National Rifle Association, most liberals are like a bull seeing a red matador's cape. It drives them up the wall. You ask them what they dislike about the NRA, it is not Charlton Hes\u00ad ton's excellent commercials about all the good that the NRA does in teach\u00ad ing gun safety, sponsoring events lead\u00ad ing up to winning gold, silver, and bronze medals in the Olympics. What they see is a group that sometimes, as they see it, and as many conservatives see it, is unreasonable about personal ownership of bazookas, heavy mortars, you name it. November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26867 Actually, the NRA is amenable to law controlling the grossest of fire\u00ad power weapons. But sometimes they dig in their heels under the theory that any law at all in the area of gun control is a foot in the door. Well, what is it about liberals when they see that so clearly that they think any law restricting wide-open abortion on demand for 9 months, why is it that they see that as a foot in the door? So what I will do, Madam Speaker, is continue my special order for 60 min\u00ad utes tomorrow night. I believe I am signed up on the record, so I will con\u00ad tinue then. COMMEMORATIVE INACTIVITY The SPEAKER pro tempore <Mrs. KENNELLY). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Michi\u00ad gan [Mr. UPTON] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, this is Wednesday evening, and a number of us on the congressional reform task force have taken this time every Wednesday since the beginning of September to talk about some of the rules changes that certainly a majori\u00ad ty of us on the Republican side would like to see changed. We have talked about things like the balanced budget amendment, constitu\u00ad tional amendment, we have talked about the line item veto, something that both Mike Dukakis and George Bush support; we have talked about the Committee on Rules and how there are nine Democrats and four Re\u00ad publicans and how that is not exactly the same ratio here in the House. But this evening our topic, and I think we will have a couple of Mem\u00ad bers here this evening, we are going to talk about commemoratives. I guess maybe you could call this evening commemorative inactivity. This year more than 400 different commemorative bills have been pro\u00ad posed. I have a chart here, I do not know if the camera will pick this up or not, but it is interesting to note that this year in the lOlst Congress, through really the end of July, of all the bills that have been enacted by the lOlst Congress, 62 percent of them have been commemorative legislation, 62 percent, almost 2-to-1. Now I have my own rule. Maybe I should call it the Fred Upton Rule, in terms of the commemorative bills that I have cosponsored. That rule is that if a Member of Congress personally comes up to me on the House floor or gives me a call in my office and says, \"Will you consponsor National Neigh\u00ad borhood Crime Watch Day?\" count me in, I am a \"yes,\" if the Member per\u00ad sonally grabs me. Or if a constituent sends me a letter or talks to me at a town meeting and says, \"Will you cosponsor National Di\u00ad abetes Month,\" absolutely, I am de\u00ad lighted to, no problem. But I do not ask my staff nor do I do this myself, thumb through as many as 400 dear-colleagues that we have seen this year looking for things that I feel that are worthwhile so that I can cosponsor them so that we can pass them, often by voice, in this Chamber. It would be a waste of my time. There are many more important things that I need to spend my time on. Some of these commemoratives, and I have rattled off a couple, are very important. I think anyone in their right mind would be delighted to co\u00ad sponsor them. Things like National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day, National Women Veterans Recognition Week, National Diabetes Month, National Glaucoma Awareness Week, End Hunger Educa\u00ad tion Month, National Child Care Week, National Organ and Issue Donor Awareness Week. Last week, of course, my good friend and colleague, PAUL HENRY from Michigan, introduced and was able to pass \"Hostage Awareness Week.\" Many of us wore a little yellow ribbon in our lapels all week to remember the hostages in the Middle East. All those are very worthwhile groups. Many of the organizations in fact trying to fight these diseases, rely on the help that commemorative days, weeks, months often give them. But 400. There are a number of commemora\u00ad tives that just sound silly or at least it does not make sense that Congress should be spending time, valuable time, on these, whether it be ourselves twisting arms, getting Members if they follow the \"Fred Upton Rule\" in terms of cosponsorship or calling Members up on the floor. National Tap Dance Day, National Barbershop Quartet Month, and I hope I do not get those folks mad at me, National Duckling Month, National Weight Loss Month, National Ceramic Tile Industry Recog\u00ad nition Week, Karate Kid Just Say No to Drugs Month, National Headache and Jaw Joint Injuries Week. In fact, when National Dairy Goat Week, a bill I was a proud sponsor of, following the \"Fred Upton Rule,\" I had more letters from my constituents on National Dairy Goat Week than I did on raising the speed limit from 55 to 65 miles an hour. Where are our priorities? In fact, there is a new bill just pro\u00ad posed called \"Interstitial Awareness Day.\" I think it might make the na\u00ad tional spelling contest, i-n-t-e-r-s-t-i-t-i\u00ad a-1. I am not sure anyone really knows what it means. In fact I grabbed my Webster's dictionary before I came over here this evening and looked up interstitial, and it says, pertaining to, containing or existing in interstices. And when you look that word up, after the proper pronunciation, which I probably butchered here, it says, \"a narrow place between things closely set, or crevice.\" D 1920 That is what that is, Crevice Aware\u00ad ness Day. Guess what? I am a cospon\u00ad sor, because the Member of Congress that offered that happened to grab me on the House floor and I followed, using the FRED UPTON rule \"No prob\u00ad lem.\" If it counts to a Member of Con\u00ad gress, to physically ask me, I am hon\u00ad ored. Hopefully, maybe I will have some constituents that will write, too. That is not something that I do not think any Member here in the Cham\u00ad ber this evening or back in their of\u00ad fices would actually go through and say, \"Gosh, that will be for me.\" No, it will take a Member of Congress to grab another Member. The work we have done this year, 62 percent of the work we have done has been with commemoratives such as these. Working Mother's Day. Well, why not Working Parents' Day? In fact earlier this year the L.A. Dodgers, and I am a Cub fan, but we gave con\u00ad gratulations on a World Series victory when we passed on April 5, 1989, that was 7 months late. The Dodgers won last year, in 1988. What are we doing with this in 1989? Well, some might say we cannot pass a budget on time, so maybe we could not congratulate the Dodgers any sooner than we can pass a budget reconciliation. Now, there has been a bill that has been introduced, and I must say there is light at the end of the tunnel, I hope. It has been a bill that has been introduced by my good friend and col\u00ad league, the gentlewoman from Rhode Island [Ms. SCHNEIDER]. Let me tell Members what that bill does. It says that only those proposals with nation\u00ad al appeal and significance which shall be demonstrated by cosponsorship of a resolution or written endorsement, et cetera, may be reported. The following types of proposals shall not be report\u00ad ed: any proposal concerning a commer\u00ad cial enterprise, specific project, or fra\u00ad ternal, political or sectarian organiza\u00ad tion; any proposal concerning a par\u00ad ticular State or political subdivision thereof; any proposal concerning a living person; any proposal which des\u00ad ignates a commemorative day or other period already passed; any proposal providing for recurring commemora\u00ad tives, notwithstanding a proposal pro\u00ad viding for an annual commenorative in each of 2 consecutive years may be re\u00ad ported. Basically what it does is this: It sets up a committee of, hopefully, only a couple of Members, that can make that decision for Members so we do not have to see 435 different Members of Congress supporting their Intersti-26868 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 tial Awareness Day, or National Diary Goat Week, or Tap Dance, Barbershop Quartet, or whatever, taking their val\u00ad uable time on this floor, getting 218 cosponsors. That is, by the way, for those who are listening this evening back in your homes, that is the way that a commemorative gets passed. If someone at home is a C-SP AN junkie, as they say, who does remember some of those bills coming up for debate on the House floor, we did not have a vote, and it did not show up in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. When did we have time to do all the bills? The rule is this: We get 218 cosponsors. That is a magic number, 218 votes on any\u00ad thing wins. It is automatically passed in the House by voice. I suppose some\u00ad one who takes the time to take the debate and it has been done from time to ~i~e, but it is automatically done, so it is sort of a silent process that we go through here. On this bill that I talked about, the gentlewoman from Rhode Island, Ms. SCHNEIDER'S bill setting up a separate committee, it has to go through the committee, and the committee in es\u00ad sence decides what projects are worth\u00ad while, what days are worthwhile and which ones are not. If a person deals with it that way, I have good news. We already have 238 cosponsors, which ~eans if we brought this up for a vote, it. has more than enough today, to\u00ad night, to pass. I think that is very im\u00ad portant. Now, this bill has been referred to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, and in discussion with the subcommittee chairman just this afternoon, my good friend the gentle\u00ad man from Ohio [Mr. SAWYER], he indi\u00ad cated that they are going to start some m.ovement on this bill. In fact, they will have some hearings very soon, and that is important, I think, because all Members, at least 237, have been will\u00ad ing to cosponsor this legislation have provided some impetus, and p~rhaps for a catalyst for getting this bill passed. Now, I want to cite a little story that was in the Washington Post the other day, by Dale Russakoff, and I will read just a couple of passages from the story because I think it will take out some of the frustrations that many Members on both sides of the aisle have with the commemorative issue. '!l_lis is a story about a harmless, public\u00ad sp1rited gesture of Congress that almost ev\u00ad eryone agrees has gotten out of hand Unlike other Washington excesses, it won't bankrupt the Treasury, it doesn't threaten public morality, it doesn't even burden small businesses. ~ut if there is a larger point-and many thmk there is-it is about discipline and how hard it is to summon it in the nation's capital. The House and Senate require that such bills be cosponsored by more than half the chamber-apparently in an effort to enforce discipline. It hasn't worked. \"The most phone calls I get are from other offices asking, 'Do you want to spon\u00ad sor my week?' \" We say no. said an aide to a freshman Democrat \"When the interns come, that's all they do'. You rarely get a call saying, 'We really want you guys ~o go on the minimum wage bill,' or somethmg substantive. \" Let me deviate from the story for a little bit here. I can remember just 2 weeks ago, I got a letter from one of my constituents asking me why I could not cosponsor a particular week for their parochial interests, and obvious\u00ad ly they were asking me to sponsor such legislation, and my response to the constituent was that I would be glad to sponsor that if someone else offered it, but I'll be damned if I'm going to off er that myself and take the time from the duties that we have to go and grab 218-plus Members to cosponsor such a bill. It is ridiculous. It is not why we came here to Con\u00ad gress. We came, all Members I would imagine, came to make a difference in terms of what we do, and these bills which are rather plentiful, we can deal with in a much more efficient manner. I think it is long overdue. Now, the bottom line is that we should not need a Presidential commission to decide these things for Members. We should not have to have tightly restricted rules to govern the process. We, Mem\u00ad bers of Congress, simply must be more responsible and sensible about some of the things that we propose. Now, 2 weeks ago, I was able to say no. However, 400 of the Members here said yes. I think that is ridiculous es\u00ad pecially when we cannot pass a budget on time, that we take time to do some of the things that we otherwise prob\u00ad ably should not. THE NEED FOR THE NUCLEAR FACILITIES OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1989 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. KENNELLY). Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Penn\u00ad sylvania [Mr. GAYDOS] is recognized for 60 minutes. Mr. GAYDOS. Madam Speaker, vir\u00ad tually every 3 or 4 days over the past 6 months or so, the American public has been bombarded with news reports concerning the poisoning of our envi\u00ad ronment or possibility of safety haz\u00ad ards arising from problems at Govern\u00ad ment-owned, contractor-operated plants that produce nuclear materials for our Government's needs. Th~se plants, located in Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Washing\u00ad ton, Colorado, and several other States, are either owned or under the control of the U.S. Department of Energy, which has responsibility for both production of the nuclear materi\u00ad als at those plants and for ensuring environmental and occupational safety and health at them. The news reports I have been read\u00ad ing are not encouraging and they lead me to believe that the DOE either can't or doesn't want to do the job that we believe is its responsibility. Let me just read some headlines. \"Poisoning Workers, Safe From Suits,\" an article in the Wall Street Journal last August, notes that \"nucle\u00ad ar weapons makers must have a finan\u00ad cial interest in the safe operations of their facilities;\" that \"negligence could have consequences,\" but that \"today there are none.\" ' Here is another headline. \"Energy Department Is Faulted on Enforcing Contracts,\" in the Washington Post last month notes that the DOE's own inspector general says the agency has allowed civilian contractors to improp\u00ad erly bill the Government for millions of dollars in costs that could and should have been disallowed. \"Bomb Plants Breaking Law, Report Says,\" is a headline that appeared in the New York Times in July, noting that a preliminary survey by the DOE's field managers revealed 174 vio\u00ad lations and 233 potential violations of various Federal law at the various nu\u00ad clear production plants. Just last week, the New York Times ran a story headlined, \"Chemicals in Hanford A-Plant Create Risk of Ex\u00ad plosion, Study Says,\" which reported that a 1984 study done for DOE by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory found about 140 tons of ferrocyanide are contained in 149 aged waste tanks at DO E's Hanford, WA, nuclear reser\u00ad vation. The study noted that explosive reactions could occur if the ferrocya\u00ad nide was combined with some other substances stored in those tanks. What's most frightening to me is the secrecy surrounding this report. The report was completed in 1984, 5 years ago, but until now, no one outside of the DOE and DOE contractors has been able to read its ominous findings. There's no telling what those 5 years have cost us in terms of human and environmental health. I could go on, Madam Speaker and I can't help but wonder what ~lse is happening at these DOE nuclear fa\u00ad cilities and what grim tidings the next 5 years will bring. I'll bet that the pic\u00ad ture won't be any brighter. Most of the articles I have cited focus on the environmental hazards arising from poor oversight at the DOE plants, but if the people living a;ound the plants are at risk, just con\u00ad sider the impact on the health and safety of the men and women actually working in those facilities. Those workers-tax-paying, law\u00ad abiding citizens-are at risk every day, and no one seems to be paying atten\u00ad tion to their well-being. These men and women are employees of the con-November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26869 tractors at the nuclear production fa\u00ad cilities and are being short-changed. They are not covered by the Occupa\u00ad tional Safety and Health Administra \u00ad tion COSHAJ and cannot count on anyone to enforce health and safety rules and regulations on an impartial basis. As set forth in the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA cannot enforce its health and safety stand\u00ad ards, rules, and regulations in facilities owned and/or operated by other Fed\u00ad eral agencies, including and especially, the Department of Energy. So, Madam Speaker, in effect, we have the fox in charge of the hen house. We have the Department of Energy, which is primarily concerned with production of nuclear materials, also responsible for the health and safety of workers in those production facilities, and we all know that this kind of system rarely works to the benefit of the workers. This spring, the Subcommittee on Health and Safety, which I chair, con\u00ad ducted two oversight hearings on the extent and quality of the worker health and safety programs provided by the Department of Energy to employees at those DOE nuclear facilities, the so-called GOCO's-Government\u00ad owned, contractor-operated plants. One fact continues to appear throughout the hearing record: DOE can't really do what has to be done be\u00ad cause its primary function is produc\u00ad tion. , This isn't something that just sprang to light, however. Ten years ago, in 1979, an investigation by the General Accounting Office CGAOJ concluded that DOE was not ade\u00ad quately monitoring and enforcing its health and safety standards for work\u00ad ers at the facilities it managed. And, things haven't gotten any better. Just this month, a study released by the DOE reports that inadequate ' safety measures at Colorado's Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant have led to conditions where workers could be exposed to potentially lethal doses of radiation. During the 10 years between these alarming reports have been various GAO studies that have indicated that conditions are comparable to what they were before that first GAO report. My concern is that conditions and programs to ensure worker health and safety will not improve at these plants unless we take action-right now, today. That is why I have introduced H.R. 3521-the Nuclear Facilities Oc\u00ad cupational Safety Improvement Act of 1989. The principal aim of this legislation is to put the responsibility for worker health and safety where it belongs\u00ad with OSHA, not the Department of Energy. It will make the system more workable and reliable by transferring DOE staff and dollars to OSHA. Thus, OSHA gets more than just the respon\u00ad sibility. It gets the resources so that it may do the job right. As of July 20, 1989, the Office of Safety, Health, and Quality Assurance in the Department of Energy had a staff of 125-99 professionals, 21 secre\u00ad taries and clerks, and 5 interns. Of the total professional staff, 34 are directly involved in worker health and safety activities and have several years of ex\u00ad perience. Ten, in fact, are on-site resi\u00ad dents permanently assigned to the fol\u00ad lowing facilities: River, SC; CO; Idaho; and Richland, WA; and, in all candor, would continue in those loca\u00ad tions. Further, the recently approved con\u00ad ference report on appropriations for the Department of Energy provides $114.6 million for Office of Environ\u00ad ment, Safety and Health. And under the provisions of my bill, that the por\u00ad tion allotted for worker health and safety would also be shifted from DOE to OSHA. This is not the first time we have faced this issue. In 1977, the Congress created the Mine Safety and Health Administration in the Department of Labor. This new agency was born by transferring then existing mine safety activities in the Department of Interi\u00ad or to the Department of Labor. That transfer was made simply because it was clear the Department of Interior was primarily concerned with produc\u00ad tion and, therefore, was unable to put worker health and safety first. We have the exact same thing hap\u00ad pening at these nuclear plants. DOE has been negligent and reckless in op\u00ad erating its facilities and has let pro\u00ad duction push health and safety out of the picture. Just one example is that DOE operated its reactors at Savan\u00ad nah River for almost 7 years, from 1979 to 1986, at 26 percent higher power than the emergency core cool\u00ad ing system could handle in case of an accident. What this means is we would have had an uncontrolled meltdown\u00ad worker safety finished a poor second to production. Now, I'm not suggesting that Secre\u00ad tary of Energy James Watkins and the personnel of the Department of Energy don't care about worker health and safety. All I'm saying is that no agency can serve two masters effec\u00ad tively-one or the other must suffer and history shows that worker health and safety usually comes in behind production. We have pointed out in the past that such conflicts can and do occur. DOE's objectivity suffers when the choice is between production and safety proce\u00ad dures. During the 1970's, for example, DOE considered closing its Fernald plant in Ohio and, as a result, it did not make necessary capital improve-ments. In the early 1980's, as equip\u00ad ment became obsolete and production goals increased, a strain was put on the plant's resources . This forced man\u00ad agement to chose between production needs and worker health and safety concerns. DOE's own documents show that Fernald's management chose pro\u00ad duction. More recently, we have seen policy statements that on their face appear to contradict other recent policy deci\u00ad sions. On May 17, Peter Brush, the acting Assistant Secretary of Energy for En\u00ad vironment, Safety and Health, ap\u00ad peared before the Subcommittee on Health and Safety and testified to the Department's commitment to compre\u00ad hensive inspections to assure workers that DOE nuclear production facilities were safe. Documents provided by the Depart\u00ad ment show that since the creation of the Office of Environment, Safety and Health in 1986, numerous inspections had been conducted at facilities throughout the country. Just 2 days after Mr. Brush's ap\u00ad pearance, Secretary Watkins an\u00ad nounced a plan that would reduce the authority of that cental health and safety office and return authority for DOE area managers who work most closely with the contractors and whose principal concerns focus on produc\u00ad tion. Keep this sequence of events in mind. On May 17, the subcommittee is told that the Department of Energy is committed to assuring the health and safety of workers at DOE nuclear pro\u00ad duction facilities. But on May 19, the authority for overseeing that health and safety is transferred to the area managers whose primary responsibil\u00ad ity is to ensure that production levels are maintained and increased. Somehow the logic of this decision escapes me-except that I know the real aim of the policy switch has to ar\u00ad range for the reopening of the Savan\u00ad nah River plant-notwithstanding the seriousness of the environmental and occupational safety and health prob\u00ad lems there. On June 9, just a couple of weeks later, the FBI charged that senior DOE officials knew for years about il\u00ad legal and dangerous toxic waste dis\u00ad posal activities at the Rocky Flats nu\u00ad clear weapons facility near Denver. One week later, DOE declared a new policy-a fundamental change of pri\u00ad orities at all 18 nuclear weapons pro\u00ad duction plants, assuring that safety and health was no longer just a factor but the first priority and that weapons production is second unto that. I'll believe it when I see it. There is another system that DOE says it has used as a means of encour\u00ad aging contractors to make health and 26870 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 safety improvements and that focuses on the awared-fee system. Under the award-fee structure, the arrangement, the contractor's fee is based on after-the-fact subjective eval\u00ad uations predesignated areas, in\u00ad cluding health and safety. In theory, it sounds great. In prac\u00ad tice, it is fairly spotty. DOE has 52 management and operating contracts, of which 19 involve nuclear weapons production facilities and 18 others are nuclear related. Of the 52 contracts, 28 operate under an award-fee system, but there is some question as to whether occupational and/or environ\u00ad mental health and safety are among the factors to be considered in each of those 28 contracts. Just last Thursday, for example, the New York Times ran an article head\u00ad lined, \"Atomic Plant Bonuses Stir Second Thoughts\" about some of these awards to the contractors at Rocky Flats and Savannah River. And I quote: The Energy Department acknowledged Tuesday that it might have erred in reward\u00ad ing the private operators of some its nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite serious failings to protect the health and safety of workers and nearby residents. One can see worker health and safety are have not been factors in the older contracts, and most have been in place for several years. We will have to wait to learn if the contracts to be negotiated over the next 2 or 3 years will include health and safety as a factor. Secretary Watkins noted on June 27 that \"not less than 51 percent of the available award will be based on com\u00ad pliance with environmental, safety, and health requirements,\" but, as I just noted, that will ultimately depend on the structure of the individual con\u00ad tracts. Presently, if the provision isn't in the contract, there doesn't seem to be any way to write it in until new con\u00ad tracts are drawn-and signed. Another persistent problem has been getting health data on workers and former workers at DOE nuclear facilities. For years, DOE has classi\u00ad fied these health records, preventing not only the workers, but their physi\u00ad cians from learning the truth. Yes, Secretary Watkins indicated a few months ago that the DO E's policy on releasing that data is going to change, but we have not seen any action yet. So, my bill also would require the Secretary of Energy and the contrac\u00ad tors operating DOE nuclear facilities to cooperate with the Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services during inspections or investigations. DOE would be required to provide full access to all records of injury and ill\u00ad nesses, as well as data on exposures to toxic and hazardous substances, and medical records of current and former employees. For those claiming that outside access to these facilities would threat\u00ad en national security, the bill has a pro\u00ad vision that protects the confidentiality of information at DOE plants. Access may be denied to any person who has not been granted a security clearance or access authorization by the Secre\u00ad tary of Energy. Because of the discoveries and im\u00ad provements in occupational medicine, we know that the risks of occupational diseases and deaths among these work\u00ad ers are real. The threats, however, aren't usually in the form of onsite in\u00ad juries. Rather, the menace is a hidden one and isn't only limited to radiation exposure. Workers at these DOE fa\u00ad cilities are exposed to a wide range of other toxic and hazardous substances. Nuclear workers who develop beryl\u00ad liosis-usually found in the lungs from the inhalation of beryllium fumes or particles-don't get sick right away. The latency periods of nerve disease, kidney disease, and cancer, just to name a few, are in the decades of years-the diseases not arising for as long as 10, 20, or even 40 years after the last exposures. Sometimes, doctors aren't aware of the hazards patients have been ex\u00ad posed to, and therefore, are unable to make the link between the disease and the exposure. In Tennessee, for example, DOE fa\u00ad cility workers were concerned about the possible effects from their expo\u00ad sures to mercury in the 1950's and 1960's. Only through an extensive medical evaluation conducted by the University of Michigan was it discov\u00ad ered that there was neurological damage from mercury exposure among some of these exposed workers some 30 years after they were last ex\u00ad posed. The Nuclear Facilities Occupational Safety Act of 1989 establishes a seven\u00ad member health advisory committee to accurately and fully estimate the extent of the health and safety prob\u00ad lems at DOE facilities. This commit\u00ad tee, chaired by the Secretary of Labor, will be made up of two representatives from NIOSH, two from DOE, and two from the occupational health and safety community. This committee will issue guidlines for baseline health examinations for employees and family members, and for lifetime medical surveillance for current and former employees and their families. The bill also will make sure that em\u00ad ployees are aware of the hazards they deal with on their jobs and receive training in health and safety topics such as personal protective equipment, radiation exposure, decontamination requirements, facility and site safety and health plans, health effects, and hazard communications. As a local supplement to the health advisory committee, every DOE nucle\u00ad ar facility will have a labor-manage\u00ad ment health and safety committee, made up of the senior DOE official, the Government contractor facility manager, and an employee-appointed or elected representative for each labor organization at that site. This committee will meet monthly to review the health and safety policy of that facility. If a committee deter\u00ad mines that the facility's operation is a health and safety hazard to its person\u00ad nel, it has the authority to stop oper\u00ad ations until such time as the hazard is corrected. It's time that we do more than just pay lipservice to the health and safety needs of workers at DOE facilities. The very least that this legislation would do is guarantee these workers the information that all workers de\u00ad serve-a peace of mind about the safety conditions of their workplace. These workers could then be assured their health and their safety would not get second billing to production levels. I know some will point to a recent cooperative agreement between OSHA and the Department of Energy where\u00ad by several safety and health experts in OSHA have been assigned to the De\u00ad partment of Energy to assist in inspec\u00ad tions of nuclear production facilities, as a reason for saying this bill is un\u00ad necessary. In a recent public comment, Secre\u00ad tary Watkins suggested that any laws Congress might pass could \"wreck\" the progress he is making in DOE. He says patience and his current manage\u00ad rial changes will result in better and improving worker health and safety. Based on my own experiences of fol\u00ad lowing the different twists and turns of the Secretary's policies, I cannot agree. The cooperative agreement between DOE and OSHA and the so-called Tiger Teams that have been created are just more icing on a cake that isn't very tasty to begin with. The cooperative agreement does not give OSHA's personnel the authority to act. In this arrangement, they are still subservient to the DOE staff and can be assigned as the DOE deter\u00ad mines. OSHA needs the freedom to assign its personnel in order to determine the necessary actions to protect workers in nuclear production facilities from health and safety hazards. And the workers in those nuclear production facilities deserve the kinds of health and safety protections that can only be provided by an impartial agency that has health and safety not only as its priority goal, but as its only goal-and that agency is OSHA, as it November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26871 determines the needs of workers in nu\u00ad clear production facilities. I urge my colleagues to join me in saying that worker health and safety should never be secondary to produc\u00ad tion. By cosponsoring this legislation, the Members of this House will show that they want to elevate worker health and safety to a higher level and that it should never be an after\u00ad thought. D 1950 DEALING WITH THE PHILLIPS CHEMICAL CORP.'S PASADENA, TX, PLANT EXPLOSION Madam Speaker, I want to deviate from these special orders and take up a few remarks dealing with the Phil\u00ad lips Chemical Corp.'s Pasadena, TX, plant explosion, along these same lines. Madam Speaker, roughly a week ago, an explosion and fire at the Phil\u00ad lips Chemical Corp.'s processing plant in Pasadena, TX, took the lives of 14 workers and injured more than 100 others. There are eight workers whose bodies are still buried-somewhere under the rubble. I know that there are those who would like holding hearings while the ruins are still smoldering, but that is not my style. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Safety, I have tried to function somewhat differently. I have tried to operate, first, to examine those tragedies that have occurred so as to assist the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the De\u00ad partment of Labor in developing better standards and regulations for the protection of the lives of Ameri\u00ad ca's working men and women, and second, by focusing on future prob\u00ad lems that will face American workers. The Subcommittee on Health and Safety was the first congressional body to draw attention to the poten\u00ad tial problems arising from extended use of video display terminals. Just re\u00ad cently, we conducted hearings on po\u00ad tential and real problems in the semi\u00ad conductor industry and the problems arising from the use of diesel-powered equipment in underground coal mines and closed workplaces above ground. As to the focus of tragedies, after having served as chairman of the sub\u00ad committee for some 12 years, I am no stranger to the tears of survivors and families of victims as they try to recov\u00ad er their friends and loved ones. In 1984, a terrible fire in the Wilberg Mine in Orangeville, UT, resulted in the deaths of 27 miners. We could have rushed out and had hearings im\u00ad mediately, but to what purpose? It took several months until the fire was extinguished and the bodies recovered. And this required that the original en\u00ad trance to the mine be sealed and that a new tunnel be dug. The investigations into this tragedy took months. But when we held our subcommittee hearings, we were able to really understand what had hap\u00ad pened and, because of that, we were able to make some strong recommen\u00ad dations in the subcommittee's staff report on that tragedy. Some of those recommendations already have been adopted, and others will be. In April of 1987, 28 construction workers were killed when the building in Bridgeport, CT, collapsed. Yes, there was an immediate cry for sub\u00ad committee hearings there, but I resist\u00ad ed. Six months later, when we held our hearings, we not only learned what had happened in Bridgeport, but we also were given some concrete an\u00ad swers as to what was being and was going to be done. Now, we are ready to again address ourselves to the issue of health and safety in the construction industry and, perhaps as early as next year, we will have more hearings to determine whether OSHA's actions thus far have been effective enough or whether we need to do more, whether administra\u00ad tively or legislatively. I could easily go on. I could talk about the tragedy at Willow Island in St. Mary's, WV, when a cooling tower under construction collapsed killing 51 workers. I could cite the rash of grain elevator explosions that ripped through this country, killing many workers and injuring more. When we held subcommittee hear\u00ad ings on the grain elevator explosions we learned a lot and were able to con\u00ad vince others that something needed to be done. The result was OSHA's grain elevator standard. This is not the time for hearings on the tragedy in Pasadena, TX. Right now we need to let OSHA under its new leadership and the Department of Labor take charge of the investigation, to determine as best as possible what the causes of it were, and then to seek actions to preclude such tragedies from recurring. The time for hearings is later, when we have the kinds of information we need to make thoughtful decisions that will lead to the prevention of needless deaths and injuries among America's workers. REPORT FROM LEBANON The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen\u00ad tlewoman from Ohio [Ms. OAKAR] is recognized for 60 minutes. Ms. OAKAR. Madam Speaker, this evening in the few minutes that we have, I would like to discuss, among other things, the trip that the gentle\u00ad man from West Virginia [Mr. RAHALL] and I took to Lebanon last weekend. I want to say at the outset, Madam Speaker, that we did not go on that trip in any way to embarrass the State Department, or certainly not to try to embarrass any individuals in the ad-ministration. We went on that trip be\u00ad cause we felt that the country of Leba\u00ad non is at a crossroad, that indeed there has been great tragedy in that country and there is a certain move\u00ad ment toward unification, territorial in\u00ad tegrity. Frankly, there is a peace plan on the table that the people of Lebanon will soon be called upon or perhaps be called upon to ratify. We felt that there was a perception, however unreal it may be, that our country has sort of given up on that country. That is why we decided that we would attempt to meet with varie\u00ad ties of individuals who are leaders in that country. We did meet with the two rather outstanding leaders, Gen. Michel 'Aoun, who is the Acting Presi\u00ad dent and leader of the Lebanese Armed Forces, and Dr. Huss. General 'Aoun happens to be a Christian. Dr. Huss is not only an outstanding leader and former Prime Minister, but hap\u00ad pens to be a Muslim in background. D 2000 Before I say a few words about what specifically we did, I would like to just reminisce for a moment about what the country of Lebanon once was and what we hope it soon may become. The country of Lebanon was once known as the Pearl of the Middle East. Beirut was known as the Paris of the Mediterranean. The Government was a type of democracy where they had a form of elections, and in the 1960's and 1970's, Lebanon was called upon to house thousands of Palestinian ref\u00ad ugees from the neighboring areas of the Middle East and, indeed, they did, because they were known as a democ\u00ad racy, and they felt that these people had to have somewhere to go, and so they housed the people. Soon the ref\u00ad ugees became about a third of the pop\u00ad ulation. Shortly thereafter in the 1970's vari\u00ad ous countries, one of which was called upon to come into the country to try to settle an internal dispute, but vari\u00ad ous countries and various cults became present in Lebanon and, unfortunate\u00ad ly, in my judgment, this country is probably one of the most exploited countries in the world. Yes, it is also true that internally the country was undergoing problems as well. There were different factions that arose and had conflicts, and there was a lack of unity among the Lebanese themselves for a period, but perhaps if there were no other foreign sources or infiltrating of various cults, one of which, of course, is a dramatic Iranian radical influence, not that I think all the Ira\u00ad nian people are radicals, not at all, but I think that sort of radical influence the fundamental influence that the Ayatollah had perpetuated, became a real force in that area. 26872 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 D 2010 Prior to this, Lebanon was always one of the most pro-West countries in that region, so much so that General Eisenhower in the 1950's thought enough to come to their aid in 1958 and, indeed, stopped the promotion of an uprising that could have meant the disintegration of what was a very pro\u00ad American, pro-West country. Unfortu\u00ad nately, recently, and I will not go into all the other invasions and so on to\u00ad night, and I will skip through that. But from March to September 1989, recently, there has been a tremendous amount of violence in that area, and there have been almost 1,000 people killed and almost 3,000 individuals who have been wounded. The people themselves are really tired. I think what is interesting about the trip that my dear friend, the gentle\u00ad man form West Virginia CMr. RAHALL] and I experienced was that we saw the people undergoing something that I think is a phenomenon going on throughout the world. The people in that country, it seemed to me from the nonviolent picketing, from the very young to the very old families, common, ordinary, people, not the politicians, not members of the armed forces and so on, but common, ordi\u00ad nary people holding up signs saying, \"We want our country back,\" and I think that turf reclamation is going on, that reclaiming of your own land, if you will, your own quest for free\u00ad dom, your own quest for democracy is really going on throughout the world. It is kind of a world revolution, is it not? It is going on in China; it certain\u00ad ly has gone on and is going on in Poland, is going on in Latvia and Esto\u00ad nia and those wonderful countries that have been captivated against their will by the Soviet Union; the Ukraine; it is going on in East Germa\u00ad ny; and it is also going on in Lebanon . So here we are in a situation where the Arab League has, led by the Saudis and other Arab countries, put together a program of political re\u00ad forms including the promotion of a se\u00ad curity committee, a restructuring of internal security forces, disbandment of all the militia, reduction of powers for the office of the President, in\u00ad crease in power for the office of the Prime Minister, an enlargement of the Parliament from 99 to 108 seats that will be equally split among the Chris\u00ad tians and the Moslems, and they were able to achieve a kind of agreement of the parliamentarians who went to Saudi Arabia and formed this treaty very often known as the Taif treaty. With that backdrop, the gentleman from West Virginia CMr. RAHALL] and I, realizing that one of the things that people need throughout the world is hope, and they look to our country, I mean, and the great thing is that we live in the greatest country in the world. Our country is heralded for its democracy, its freedom of expression; indeed, irrespective of our problems, the fact is that we really are the freest society in the world, and if there is a kind of near perfect society in terms of a government structure, even though we do not always get things done in Congress as expeditiously as we would like, it happens to be our Government that, in my judgment, provides this wonderful opportunity for our citizens in terms of their quest for freedom. We are not only a free society, but we are a superpower, and the fact is the people throughout the world look to us for hope, and they hope that our country will lend a hand and will, at least diplomatically, become involved when they are seeking their own iden\u00ad tity and their own democracy. Unfortunately what has happened in Lebanon at the most critical time is, because there is this opportunity, we are in Lebanon, at least at a crossroads of opportunity, and at the most criti\u00ad cal time the United States Embassy is not present, and that has, to my knowledge, never happened before. I think there are fairly good reasons that the Embassy and the American personnel, most of whom are career diplomats whom I respect enormously, and there are fairly good reasons for their leaving. Much of it, I believe, however, is based on a lack of commu\u00ad nication and a real misunderstanding, a misunderstanding between our Em\u00ad bassy personnel and General 'Aoun, and I think one of the things about General 'Aoun is that while he is not a politician at all; he is respected as a leader of integrity; and I think some\u00ad times because he does not couch his words and is not as sophisticated in political savvy and finesse, he is misin\u00ad terpreted by the press. That is my im\u00ad pression whenever I read articles, par\u00ad ticularly about him here in the Ameri\u00ad can press, particularly having gone there and met the man and been with him a number of hours and having seen him, as it were, in action with his people. Madam Speaker, we went to Leba\u00ad non because we thought, at least I thought, and I know my colleague thought that it was important to show that we cared about those people and that America really values its pro\u00ad west mentality and really does care. We passed a resolution last year in\u00ad dicating that we believed wholeheart\u00ad edly in the sovereign integrity of that country and that we wanted it to suc\u00ad ceed and be able to have free elections. Madam Speaker, we went there to show our concern as a separate but equal branch of government, as Mem\u00ad bers of Congress who vote on foreign issues every day of the week, who have an obligation, it seems to me, to care about what is in the best interests of our country. It is in the best interest of our country that a pro-West democ\u00ad racy in the Middle East survive. We met with General 'Aoun who is the leader, as I mentioned, and head\u00ad quartered in East Beirut. We talked to him. He indicated to us that he was very disturbed and saddened by the Embassy's departure, and that he was sorry that there have been these mis\u00ad understandings, and that he would like to see an American presence back in Lebanon, and would like to see American involvement in what has been some negotiations. The gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. RAHALL] and I also experienced a very moving event for me, and that was the event where we saw hundreds and hundreds of people, men, women and children, meeting in the courtyard outside of the Presidential palace. People had come from miles to hold up signs indicating that they wanted their land back and they wanted their freedom, and yes, they were support\u00ad ing the general in his quest for free\u00ad dom. So that was very, very moving. I felt, and I was not prepared to feel as strongly as I do today, but I felt that the general was a very fine, decent person who has a lot of integri\u00ad ty. He has that reputation. He is not as politically polished at times, but the fact is he has a career of service to that country, and has never exploited it for his own personal gain. That is the kind of person we want in leader\u00ad ship positions anywhere in the world, it seems to me. And there was, I felt, a great desire on his part to unify his people of all religions under one gov\u00ad ernment and to have peace and sereni\u00ad ty. There is one area of this Arab League peace plan that he feels has been omitted, and that is the area that relates to Syrian forces. He knows that they cannot leave or will not leave wholesale from that country, but he feels very strongly that in the docu\u00ad ment there ought to be something that says that the Syrian Army will move outside of the city of Beirut. But he accepts every other provision, ac\u00ad cording to the general and his aides, that is in the Arab League peace plan and he accepts the reforms. In fact, he thought, as he told us, that they were not even progressive enough, and I thought that was positive because there is some room for dialog there, it seems to me. Later on in the evening we met with him in East Beirut, which happens to be the Christian area of Beirut, al\u00ad though there are Muslims who live there as well. It is a very large and beautiful city, even though it has been wracked by war over the years. Later on Congressman RAHALL and I went to meet with Dr. Salim al Huss, who is the Moslem leader and also has had a very distinguished career of gov\u00ad ernment service. He said that he ac\u00ad cepted a qualified support for the November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26873 Arab League peace plan, that he did not like all parts of it, but that he could accept it, and then ultimately decide on some of the reforms after this acceptance of the document took place. So it seemed to me, unlike what I was reading in the American press, and to be honest we really have a lot of freelance writers in the Middle East and that part of the world, but we really do not have full-time members of the press, for good reason, I sup\u00ad pose, because of the problems of safety, but it seemed to me that the individuals involved, with some assist\u00ad ance and some diplomacy from the su\u00ad perpowers, in particular our own coun\u00ad try, may provide for reconciliation. It seemed to me that if General 'Aoun was accepting nine-tenths of the docu\u00ad ment with some provisions of transi\u00ad tion relative to the Syrians, and Dr. al Huss was giving it qualified support, and the two men individually talked about their respect for each other, then indeed they were a lot closer than we are made to believe. But I really feel that they need some assistance, some more verbalization from our country. I would hope that within the framework of what we are able to do, that we restore our Embas\u00ad sy in Lebanon, that we at least send some form of an envoy there. It does not have to be public, but show the in\u00ad terest that we have in this country. I think I would like to see the President speak out more, to be honest. I know he cares about that country. He told me that personally. So I do not doubt that there is an affection there. But I do think that the administration could be much stronger in its appeal to vari\u00ad ous sides to come together for the sake of that nation's integrity and so that it survives. Lebanon, Madam Speaker, could dis\u00ad integrate and become a radicalized state, or it could, it has the potential to once again become a democracy. We are at the crossroads, and hopefully it will choose the path that Robert Frost described as the road less traveled in its quest for peace. Madam Speaker, there are a few more points I would like to make, but before I do I would like to yield to my distinguished colleague and friend, the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. RAHALL] someone whom I have had the pleasure of going at various times to that wonderful area with, and trou\u00ad bled area of the world. I want to thank him for going and for his kindness to me during the course of the trip. I yield to my friend, the gentleman from West Virginia CMr. RAHALIJ. Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding and appreciate her taking this special order so that we may discuss our trip to Beirut over the past weekend. Many of our colleagues have come to us since we have come back and wanted to know how the trip was, what Beirut was like and expressed their concern for our safety, and were relieved that we did return back to them, and we certainly want to ex\u00ad press our appreciation for their con\u00ad cern. Lebanon has been wracked by 15 years of war, needless to say. The whole world is aware of that. In the beginning, the description that it was a civil war may have been accurate. Christians fought Muslims to begin with. As time went on, Chris\u00ad tians fought Christians, Muslims fought Muslims, and it became more than just a civil war. Outside powers, Arabs fighting Arabs, Arabs fighting Israelis, Arabs fighting Palestinians, Palestinians fighting Arabs, the whole outside world looks at Lebanon as a place in which they could seek revenge against their bitter enemies. It is unfortunate that Lebanon was already wracked by the internal fight\u00ad ing, but to those outside powers they saw a ground, they saw a chessboard, if you will, that was ripe for them to move in and pick out their various proxies in order to wage a war that they cannot do face to face with their enemies, but rather could do it through the proxy battlefield of Leba\u00ad non. That has been the situation in recent years in which foreign forces have occupied Lebanon. If they had not occupied Lebanon, they have sup\u00ad plied various militias within that coun\u00ad try, and have fueled the fire that has gone on for so long. Within the country there is a tribal kinship quality to the people that says I will do whatever is necessary to pro\u00ad tect my particular block where my family lives and the surrounding blocks. That comes first to me, in their mentality, and sometimes, sometimes unfortunately above what may come first for the country of Lebanon and its sovereignty. There has been enough corruption over the years in that country. There have been enough militia leaders that make money off of war. There is no doubt about it. But I think that what my colleague, MARY ROSE OAKAR, and myself detected this past weekend was that finally, finally the people are tired of fighting and realize that nobody can win, and to keep playing these games in which their children are dying, and in which the country continues to be devastated is just sheer folly. That was the sense that I got from this trip, and I think it was very im\u00ad portant that MARY ROSE 0AKAR and myself made this sojourn at this par\u00ad ticular time. Of course, to listen to some in the administration, there is no good time to go to Lebanon. We realize that they are legitimately concerned for our safety, legitimately concerned for every American's safety in that country. But we saw this as an oppor-tunity to express to the Lebanese people, Muslims, Christians, all Leba\u00ad nese, that despite the fact that this administration did close down the United States Embassy in Beirut, that we did withdraw our physical commit\u00ad ment, that the United States, and par\u00ad ticularly the United States Congress, has not withdrawn its commitment to secure a peace in the country of Leba\u00ad non. We have seen, for example, Madam Speaker, many of our colleagues over the past 6 to 8 months, a growing number of our colleagues take to the floor of the House of Representatives and discuss their concern for what is going on in Lebanon. 0 2020 That is all very appreciative, and the remarks have been right on target. But what we wanted to do on our trip was to talk to both sides, both rival governments, which we did, General 'Aoun in the east and Dr. Salim al Huss in the west. And we said to both men that we saw this as a historic opportunity for Lebanon to achieve peace, for Lebanon to once again bring together the people of that country to determine their own destiny. The Lebanese are like any individuals, they want to con\u00ad trol their own destiny. They have a love for their families and they just want to be free to control their own affairs. We said to General 'Aoun in our close-to-4-hour meeting with him that in the United States media, often today, he is coming across as saying \"no\" to peace because of his rejection of the Taif agreement, as my colleague explained. We said to him that oftentimes, as we in American politics know, there comes a time when you cannot expect to win 100 percent what you set out to achieve, that perhaps some majority above 50 percent is a victory, that there comes a time when military means has to be set aside in favor of political compromise for peace. Yes, we said to General 'Aoun: You have achieved remarkable successes over the last 8 months, you have stood up the Syrians longer than anybody expected; you have focused world attention on the problems of Lebanon and the presence of Syrian troops therein. You have been very eloquent in your desire to preserve Lebanese sovereignty and to maintain every inch of Lebanese soil for Lebanese people. We com\u00ad mend you for that. We want to see that also. That is of\u00ad ficial policy. It has been for a number of years. It does not become cheap\u00ad ened by continuing to repeat that policy. It is our policy. It is one that we are working toward on a daily basis. But we said to General 'Aoun, who we did find to be a very inspiring indi\u00ad vidual, a man respected by his people, 26874 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE November 1, 1989 respected for his honesty and respect\u00ad ed for his beliefs, but we said that with all of the various segments in Lebanon, all the various Arab states, indeed world opinion and today the five members of the U.N. Security Council endorsing this Taif agree\u00ad ment, that perhaps it is time for him to look at the positive aspects of it, to talk about what he does agree to do. Let us set aside the negative for right now, for this historic opportunity. Time is getting short. The elections are called for by next Tuesday, presi\u00ad dential elections in the country of Leb\u00ad anon. The next few days are going to be crucial for the future of that country. As we pleaded with General 'Aoun then, we say to him again in this collo\u00ad quy on the floor of the House, that sometimes compromises are necessary for the future of his country. Some\u00ad times, as I said to him in our conclud\u00ad ing phone call right before we left the airport, that: You have to do, General, as we in Ameri\u00ad can politics have to do, and that is bite your tongue and just hope that someday perhaps the follies of your enemies catch up with them. But for now, set aside the military ad\u00ad vantage that you seek and seek the political route for peace in Lebanon. And I take this moment to issue a plea once again to General 'Aoun as we enter these crucial next several days to take a hard look at what you want for the country of Lebanon. Give peace a chance in that country, and perhaps there can be some improve\u00ad ment upon this agreement in the months and years ahead. I hope that will happen. But these next few days will be crucial as the parliament decides. They are meeting in various cities around the world, not returning to Lebanon because of Gen\u00ad eral 'Aoun's stance on the agreement that they reached, but rather trying to decide whether they will return to hold a presidential election that is called for in the agreements. And I hope that if they return, that they will return with their security guaranteed, that they will return not to threats of arrest or assassination but indeed to put the country of Leba\u00ad non back together and institute the re\u00ad forms that are so widely agreed upon even by General 'Aoun himself as called for by the Arab peace plan. Ms. OAKAR. I thank the gentleman for his eloquent statement. Madam Speaker, briefly, one area that I thought was noticeably differ\u00ad ent on this trip as compared to other trips was the absence of all the mini\u00ad militias at various checkpoints. It seems to me that the families have put down their guns and there seemed to be one central army, which is very, very important that that happen. And I thought there was more of law and order than I had certainly seen in the past, and that was refreshing because I expected to see a country very mili\u00ad tarized with all kinds of little mini\u00ad armies. But I did not see that. I wanted to make mention of the fact that Members of Congress, of whom NICK and I are a part, have sent a letter to President Bush relative to the United States diplomatic support for peace in Lebanon. More than 53 Members have signed that letter, and we were able to round up those signa\u00ad tures in a matter of minutes. Basically what they call upon the President to do is to pursue the issue of Lebanon vigorously with all the parties interest\u00ad ed in Lebanon, including the Soviet Union, to place Lebanon on the list of regional conflicts discussed during the United States-Soviet meetings and summits and to send a top-level State Department official as a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with the parties in this conflict. I wanted to say that I did not find, personally, General 'Aoun's element of disagreement that radical. I thought what he was asking for was a move\u00ad ment of the Syrians outside of the city of Beirut as a symbol that ultimately all foreign forces would leave that country. I thought that that was something that, hopefully, could be worked out prior to the forcing of an election and the parliamentarians coming home. I certainly hope that General 'Aoun and Dr. Salim al Huss can see if there isn't a little bit of movement that could take place. It seems to me they are so close to getting toward reconciliation that they ought to, as my colleague said, give peace a chance. One other element that I wanted to mention was that Congressman RAHALL and I did raise the issue of the hostages publicly during our press con\u00ad ference. It happened, ironically, when we got there, to be the birthday of Terry Anderson, who is the longest\u00ad held hostage. Here in Washington, throughout the country, and certainly in northern Ohio, where Terry is from, which is the region from which I come, the people are praying for him and the other hostages on a daily basis. Our Congress passed a Hostage Awareness Day on that Friday, Terry's birthday. So we mentioned that at our press conference. We also mentioned that point of the release of the hostages as a kind of a humanitarian human rights issue that would be a wonderful gesture for those captors to put for\u00ad ward, particularly at this wonderful period of hope, hopefully, and both leaders certainly endorsed the idea of releasing those hostages. I think it should be clear to the American people that it is not all the Lebanese who are into captivating in\u00ad dividuals against their will. As a matter of fact, it is a very small seg\u00ad ment that are supposedly Iranian-con-trolled, the radical Iranian-controlled group, not even the mainstream indi\u00ad viduals that happen to share the same religion as the Iranians do. 0 2030 The radical element, a small minori\u00ad ty, that have chosen to deal with this issue, and deal with their complaints, whatever they may be, in a very cow\u00ad ardly way by keeping people against their will. Terry has a 4-year-old daughter that he has never seen. It seems to me that this fine AP correspondent whose mis\u00ad sion is to tell the truth about what is going on, and the mission of other in\u00ad dividuals who are held in captivity should be looked at again. We made a real appeal to those holding them to release the hostages. I yield to my friend, the gentleman from West Virginia. Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, I just want to stress what the gentle\u00ad woman has just mentioned. That is, that the taking of hostages in the country of Lebanon does not mean, contrary to the perception that may exist in America media accounts, does not mean that the Lebanese are re\u00ad sponsible for these outrageous acts. Indeed, many of the Lebanese will say they themselves are being held hos\u00ad tage by the foreign forces that occupy their land. I was asked by a reporter upon my return, \"Does General 'Aoun care about the hostages?\" And I was taken back by the question. He cares about the hostages, and he condemned those hostage takers at our meeting, as strongly as any Member on the floor has. Dr. Huss of West Beirut con\u00ad demned them with the same ferocious\u00ad ness as we in the House of Representa\u00ad tives would do. So the Lebanese are not responsible for these acts of hostage taking. As my colleague said, groups claiming alle\u00ad giance to one of the many foreign ele\u00ad ments in Lebanon, in this particular case, the Iranian Hezbollah, a very real problem in that country, and one that we do not want to see grow. I think just to conclude on this point, the Lebanese should not be per\u00ad ceived as those responsible for taking of hostages. If, indeed, those that are responsible are Iranians, then it should also be remembered that Irani\u00ad ans are not Arabs. I think that is an\u00ad other perception that exists so often in our media when we speak of hos\u00ad tage taking, and when we speak of hi\u00ad jacking, and we speak of terrorisms. As much as we all condemn every such act of that nature, that we have to look at who the real culprits are, and not stereotype all Arabs or all Leba\u00ad nese as terrorists in that same sense. Ms. OAKAR. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for his words, and let me just conclude by saying November 1, 1989 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE 26875 that we are happy to be home. It was a marvelous experience for both of these Members. We certainly felt that we met two men of great integrity who are fine leaders. I myself think if I had to vote, I would try to vote for them to form a coalition government. I really would. I think they have a great deal of respect for each other, and there is no reason why if they can tone down some of the rhetoric, get together for the sake of that country, and ultimately have all foreign countries removed and all cults and all the other people who have preyed upon them all these years, leave the country to let the Lebanese themselves settle their own disputes. Madam Speaker, we pray that our country, also, will become involved diplomatically and will see that this country ought to be a priority for the administration, and ought to be talked about more, and dealt with more forthrightly, and not put on the back burner, because that certainly is the impression that the people have. Frankly, it has been the impression that I myself have had with all due re\u00ad spect to the outstanding diplomats and people at the State Department who have devoted their youth to the service of this country. So as the Leba\u00ad nese say at times, \"In Shallah.\" That means, If God wills it, it will pass. But it will take will power, as well. We will hope that whatever we did accomplish or try to accomplish as a gesture, a symbol of caring and manifestation of peace, played, hopefully, a positive role in that country's formation.
