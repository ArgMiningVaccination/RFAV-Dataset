The announcement was met with swift and biting criticism from health experts and medical professionals. Those critics warn that the move could help unproven, potentially dangerous, and blatantly bogus remedies continue to slink into patient care. The homeopathic dump may ease some of that criticism. But the school still boasts a lengthy menu of other questionable therapies, such as [detoxification](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-dubious-practice-of-detox) (which is only truly useful if you have been poisoned or have liver and/or kidney failure) and [cupping](https://www.statnews.com/2016/08/08/olympic-athletes-cupping/) (which is backed by little evidence). And the removal of homeopathy may anger key donors\u2014billionaires Susan and Henry Samueli. The Samuelis are largely behind the creation of UCI's integrative medicine program, dubbed the Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences. It was established with [a $200 million grant from the couple](https://news.uci.edu/2017/09/18/uci-receives-200-million-gift-to-name-college-of-health-sciences-and-launch-major-integrative-health-initiative/). Henry Samueli, a co-founder of Broadcom, and Susan Samueli are strong proponents for alternative medicines and homeopathy specifically. According to the Samueli Institute, Susan Samueli received a degree from the American Holistic College of Nutrition in 1993 and a certificate in homeopathy from the British Institute of Homeopathy in 1994. She reportedly \"developed an active consulting practice\" dealing with homeopathy, nutrition, and Chinese herbs.Homeopathy is based on the idea that \"like cures like\"\u2014in other words, that diseases and ailments can be remedied by toxic substances that cause similar symptoms or conditions. Practitioners rely on the scientifically implausible idea that extremely diluted doses of those substances can be effective, often diluting to the point where there is no active ingredient left. Yet some claim that water can have a \"memory\" of the substances. Scientists and health experts have repeatedly denounced homeopathy as quackery and noted that any reported benefits are down to nothing more than the placebo effect. Still, fringe doctors and wellness gurus continue to champion the treatments. Up until at least last week, UCI was among those champions. On the UC Irvine Health website, the healthcare provider listed homeopathy [among \"Functional Medicine\" treatments](http://www.ucirvinehealth.org/medical-services/susan-samueli-center-integrative-medicine/functional-medicine). It was sandwiched between \"Herbs and dietary supplements,\" and \"Manipulative therapies.\" But it is no longer present. When and why it was removed are unclear. It's also unclear whether the deletion signals that UCI will wholly abandon the practice or simply refrain from mentioning it publicly. UCI did not respond to Ars' request for comment. Critic Britt Marie Hermes noted that UCI \"naturopath and acupuncturist\" Dayna Kowata still notes homeopathy as her \" [preferred mode of treatment](http://www.sscim.uci.edu/dayna-kowata.asp)\" on her UCI webpage.
