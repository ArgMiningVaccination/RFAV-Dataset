Vaccination is an effective means to prevent and/or reduce the adverse effects of specific diseases in poultry. Poultry: -chicken, turkey, duck, goose, quail, pheasant, pigeon, guinea fowl, fowl, ostrich, emu and rhea. Vaccinate against who? Diseasecausing organisms Vaccinate Vaccination should be considered ifthe flock owner has experienced one or more of the following: 1. Takes birds to poultry shows 2. Buys birds from hatcheries , bird auctions , or other sources and adds them to an existing flock 3. Has had disease problems in the past Vaccines Livevirus vaccines reproduce in the host to increase their numbers. Killedvirus product is dependent upon the number of antigenic units (e.g., virus particles) present in the vaccine dose to stimulate antibody production. -Most poultry vaccines are the livevirus type. -Bacterins bacterial vaccines are live or inactivated preparations of bacteria. Marek's Disease Vaccine Clinical signs: Type of avian cancer. Tumors in nerves cause lameness and paralysis. Tumors can occur in the eyes and cause irregularly shaped pupils and blindness. Tumors of the liver, kidney, spleen, gonads, pancreas, proventriculus, lungs, muscles, and skin Can cause incoordination, unthriftiness, paleness, weak labored breathing, and enlarged feather follicles. Terminal stages: the birds are emaciated with pale, scaly combs and greenish diarrhea Marek's Disease Vaccine Usually administered to chickens at the hatchery on the day of hatch. It is given subcutaneously (under the skin) at the back of the neck. It is best to order chicks already vaccinated at the hatchery. -It only prevents the appearance of Marek's disease tumors and paralysis. -Does not prevent the birds from becoming infected with and shedding the Marek's virus. Marek's Disease Vaccine Susceptibility: chickens 2 to 16 weeks of age (prior to sexual maturity) Marek's disease can occasionally occur in pheasants, quail, game fowl, and turkeys. Newcastle Disease Clinical signs: Three forms of Newcastle disease mildly pathogenic (lentogenic), moderately pathogenic (mesogenic) and highly pathogenic (velogenic). Characterized by a sudden onset of -Hoarse chirps (in chicks) -Watery discharge -Facial swelling -Paralysis -Trembling -Twisting of the neck (sign of central nervous system involvement) Mortality ranges from 10 to 80 percent depending on the pathogenicity. In adult laying birds, symptoms can include decreased feed and water consumption and a dramatic drop in egg production. Newcastle Disease Chickens and turkeys can be immunized against Newcastle disease. Lowvirulence livevirus vaccines are administered by: -Drinking water, intraocular (eye drops), intranasal (nose drops), spray). -Killedvirus oil - intramuscularly, subcutaneously Prior to the onset of egg production. Newcastle Disease Purchasing pullets or mature chickens: -They can be vaccinated with Newcastle disease (B1) vaccine via drinking water, intraocular or intranasal routes. -The more reactive LaSota Newcastle disease vaccine is then given 4 weeks later. Turkeys are often vaccinated against Newcastle disease at 4 weeks of age, and again when the breeders are housed. Infectious Bronchitis Clinical signs: Feed and water consumption declines Chirping Watery discharge from the eyes and nostrils Labored breathing Gasping in young chickens Breathing noises Egg production drops dramatically Eggshells become rough and the egg white becomes watery Infectious Bronchitis This is primarily a respiratory disease of chickens. Modified livevirus vaccines (usually containing the Massachusetts serotype) are administered in young chickens. Vaccines are effective only if they contain the right serotype of virus for a given area. Do not vaccinate during an outbreak. Infectious bronchitis is often combined with Newcastle vaccine in the same vial and given at the hatchery or at 10 35 days of age. Killedvirus vaccines (oil emulsion base) are also available. -Administered by injection (subQ or IM) to breeders from 14 18 weeks of age. Laryngotracheitis Clinical signs Watery eyes Birds remain quiet - difficulty breathing Coughing, sneezing Shaking of the head dislodge exudate plugs in the windpipe Birds extend their head and neck - facilitate breathing Wheezing and gurgling sound Laryngotracheitis Affects both chickens and pheasants. Vaccination is not as successful as for other diseases -An excellent preventive measure for use in outbreaks and in epidemic areas. State approval is required prior to vaccination. Do not vaccinate unless you have a problem on your farm or in your area. All chickens on the premises must be vaccinated , including any new birds that are added later. Yearly boosters are advised. Administered by the eyeor nosedrop method. Birds should be at least 4 weeks old. Foul Pox Clinical Signs Dry form -Raised, wartlike lesions on unfeathered areas -The lesions heal in about 2 weeks. -If the scab is removed before healing is complete, the surface beneath is raw and bleeding. -Unthriftiness and retarded growth -Laying hens: decline in egg production Wet form -Cankerlike lesions p p e r air passage obstruction. Chickens may be affected with either or both forms of fowl pox at one time. Foul Pox Six closely related strains of pox virus: -Fowl pox, pigeon pox, quail pox, canary pox, psittacine pox, and ratite pox. Pox can be prevented in chickens, turkeys and pigeons by vaccination , but there is no effective commercial vaccine against canary pox. Chickens and pigeons are usually vaccinated by the wing web stick method . -An applicator with two slotted needles dipped in vaccine and thrust through the wing web. Turkeys are not generally vaccinated by the wing web route. -Vaccinated by a thighstick method . Foul Pox All domestic chicks and poults can be vaccinated at 1 day of age, pullets at 10 to 12 weeks, and turkeys at 8 to 14 weeks or when moved to range. The virus is spread from bird to bird through the bites of bloodsucking insects or through wounds and scratches by the birds when fighting. If there is a heavy mosquito infestation in an area, small flock owners may consider vaccinating with fowl pox vaccine.Fowl Cholera Clinical signs Usually strikes birds older than 6 weeks Dead birds (first sign) Fever Reduced feed consumption Mucoid discharge from the mouth Ruffled feathers Diarrhea Labored breathing Weight loss Lameness -f r o m joint infections Rattling noises -e x u d a t e s in air passage Abscessed wattles Swollen joints and foot pads Turkeys may have twisted necks Fowl Cholera Affects most birds including domestic fowl (primarily chickens and turkeys), game birds (especially pheasants), ducks, cage birds, wild birds. Two types of fowl cholera vaccines - -live attenuated -Inactivated bacterins Oral vaccine - attenuated administered in the drinking water. Oilemulsion bacterins -series of two injections given at 4 week intervals. Do not vaccinate unless you have had a problem on your area. Avian Encephalomyelitis Clinical signs Signs commonly appear during the first week of life Dull expression of the eyes Progressive incoordination Sitting on hocks Tremors of the head and neck Paralysis or prostration Inactivity Walking on their hocks Feed and water consumption decreases Transitory drop (520 percent) in egg production Chickens which survive may develop cataracts later in life Avian Encephalomyelitis Avian encephalomyelitis (AE) is a viral infection of poultry, primarily chickens, turkeys, pheasants, and coturnix quail. Lifetime immunity is acquired through vaccination or recovery from a natural outbreak. Breeder chickens arevaccinated at 1016 weeks of age. The vaccine is administered in the drinking water. -Pheasants: 510 weeks -Bobwhite quail: 610 weeks Avian encephalomyelitis should not be confused with St. Louis encephalitis. TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL VACCINATION Vaccination of poultry younger than 10 days of age cannot be expected to produce uniform or lasting immunity, even in the absence of parental immunity. -Except for Marek's disease (given on the day of hatch). Rotate vaccine stock. An outdated product may have deteriorated. Each vaccine is designed for a specific route of administration. Use only the recommended route -s e e LABEL Do not vaccinate sick birds (except in outbreaks of laryngotracheitis or fowl pox). TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL VACCINATION Protect vaccines from heat and direct sunlight. Most vaccines are living, diseaseproducing agents. Handle them with care. When using the drinkingwater method of vaccination, be sure the water is free of sanitizers and chlorine . Livevirus vaccines are readily destroyed by these chemicals. After vaccinating, burn or disinfect all opened containers to prevent accidental spread to other poultry.Jonael H. BosquesM\u00e9ndez Small "}
