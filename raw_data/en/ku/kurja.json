Reiki alone can bring peace, light and love to all those looking for its healing qualities. As powerful as Reiki is, several healers have found that adding and mixing various other forms of energy healing enhances the experience for their clients as well as during their own Reiki practice. I myself have added various techniques to my sessions with clients.

Aromatherapy is working with scents, holistically treating ailments with the use of scent for physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. Aromatherapy is no longer used only in massage therapy, but it can be used as a stand-alone practice. I incorporate aromatherapy into my Reiki sessions because as with Reiki, everything is energy and everything vibrates at its own frequency. Each essential oil correlates with our chakras and energy fields to promote healing along with the Reiki. The scents enhance the experience, add ambiance to the environment and can help the client relax, let go and get deeper into the experience. Essential Oils Some clients might be coming in for their first session and will be nervous, anxious about what to expect. The use of essential oils such as Lavender or Eucalyptus can help the client relax. A spritz of sweet orange or peppermint can help slowly bring a client back to the Reiki room after a deeply relaxing session. Certain essential oils correlate with a particular chakra. For example, if a client is coming in to work on their third eye then a blend of lavender with patchouli will work. They gently place it on their third eye, and it will not only relax and ground them but help to bring healing and opening to the third eye. It is very important to understand the use of any essential oil and how to blend them. Never take any essential oil internally, and always blend with a carrier oil as essential oils can cause skin sensitivity on some and should never be applied directly on the skin. With the study of aromatherapy, one can bring about different levels of healing to our clients and to ourselves.
