Herbal medicine, also known as herbalism or phytotherapy (plant therapy), is a medical system based on the use of plants or plant extracts that may be ingested or used topically. Herbal medicine has been used by many different cultures throughout the world to treat illness and to assist bodily function. It is one of the most ancient forms of medicine and pre-dates written history by thousands of years. Seeing a Qualified Practitioner To gain a qualification in herbal medicine practitioners undergo extensive training in the philosophies, principles and practice of herbal medicine, as well as fundamentals of medical science, including anatomy & physiology, pathophysiology (the underlying cause of diseases), differential diagnosis, pharmacokinetics (what our bodies do to the plants) and pharmacodynamics (what the plants do to our bodies). A degree/diploma in Herbal Medicine is accredited by the NZQA which by definition, must be research-based.

Presumably this is due to personal bias (or simply paraphrasing someone else's views that was shared with them at medical school) as there is a plethora of research on herbal medicine demonstrating profound effectiveness. Oftentimes these same practitioners who are so dismissive of natural medicine may want to give someone a certain medication, and they may well say to them stop taking any herbs as it may \"interfere with the drug\". Does this not imply that they do have an effect on the body and its mechanisms? On that note, it is commonly believed by many that because herbs are natural, they are safe. While this is true for the vast majority of herbs, some plants can do harm when used incorrectly. Plus, in this 'chemical age' we live in, herbs can interact not only with pharmaceutical drugs and affect their action in the body, but they can also interact with each other. By consulting a practitioner qualified in medical herbalism you can be assured you are getting: Types of Herbal Medicines Herbal medicines for internal use can be prescribed by a qualified herbal practitioner in many forms, such as tablets, capsules, medicinal teas or as a fluid extract (also referred to as a liquid tonic, liquid extract, fluid extract, botanical extract). Some of the advantages of a liquid herbal formula or tonic are: - The right herb at the right therapeutic dose - Herbs safe for your condition - Herbs which won't interact adversely with your other medications/supplements Types of Herbal Medicines Herbal medicines for internal use can be prescribed by a qualified herbal practitioner in many forms, such as tablets, capsules, medicinal teas or as a fluid extract (also referred to as a liquid tonic, liquid extract, fluid extract, botanical extract). Some of the advantages of a liquid herbal formula or tonic are: - They can be tailored to meet your individual need(s) - They contain no excipients, tableting agents, etc. - Liquids are more easily assimilated by the body - The are highly potentised and much stronger than capsule/tablet form | | Tips on Taking Your Fluid Extract Most importantly, follow the directions supplied by your practitioner. We know your individual case and will provide details on how much and how often to take your herbal tonic, based on your individual requirements. Dosage: In general, your herbal tonic should be taken in a divided dose - most herbs need to be taken at least twice daily to ensure the therapeutic components of the herbs maintain their activity in your body around the clock. In some cases however your practitioner may recommend a single dose at a specific time of day - for example sedative herbs taken just before bed. Always follow the instructions of your practitioner. Dilution: When it comes to herbs, the old adage \"the worse it tastes, the better it is for you\" tends to be true. Most fluid extracts should be taken diluted in water or juice to make them more palatable. Measure the required dosage into a measuring cup and top up with water/juice - in general 20-25ml is sufficient to dilute the herbs. Don't dilute the herbs too much as you will have more unpleasant tasting liquid to swallow. It is best to take the herbs like a 'shot' followed by a 'chaser' of water or juice to remove the taste of the herbs from your mouth.

Shake The Bottle Well Before Use Inadequately shaking the bottle means the active constituents of the herbs may not be consistently dispersed throughout the liquid, so you won't be getting the most benefit from your herbal tonic. Sedimentation may also happen in the bottle over time if the liquid is not shaken properly before every dose. Storage of Herbal Medicines Herbal medicines should be stored away from direct sunlight and below 30\u00b0C. Sunlight and heat will reduce the shelf life of the herbs and deteriorate active constituents. There is no need to store herbs in the fridge. Before or After Food? Your practitioner will advise if your tonic should be taken before or after food. In general, when taken before food herbs will be absorbed into your bloodstream quicker, however in many cases your practitioner will recommend taking the herbs after food to avoid possible irritation of the stomach which may result in nausea. In some cases, such as with bitter herbs prescribed to improve digestion, it is critical to take these on an empty stomach. Safety Guidelines Always follow the instructions provided by your practitioner. Only take as directed - do not exceed the prescribed dosage! Always advise your practitioner of any medications or supplements you are taking; if you become pregnant or if you notice any significant change in your 'normal' bodily function e.g. a change in frequency of your bowel movements. Your prescription is for you only, not to share. If in doubt, contact your practitioner. Making a Medicinal Herbal Tea Medicinal herbal teas may be drunk hot or cold, though in most cases they are most beneficial when hot, especially when the herb contains active volatile oils which are released when hot water is poured on them. There are two types of herbal teas 1) infusions and 2) decoctions. Infusions are used for soft plant parts e.g. flowers, leaves and herb. Decoctions are used for harder, woody plant parts such as roots and bark.

Use a heaped teaspoonful of dried herb or herb mixture per cup of hot water. Pour boiled water (just off the boil) over the herbs and cover with a lid immediately. Covering the herbs traps all the important volatile components of the herbs. Leave it to steep for 5-10 minutes, strain and drink. Giving Herbs to Children The flexibility in dosage and ease in taking liquids make liquid herbal tonics ideal for children - the only potential downside is the taste. To ensure compliance here are a few tips for getting your kid's to take their herbs. - Mix with honey or juice - blackcurrant syrup is particularly good for disguising the taste of unpleasant herbs. - Make into an ice-block, jelly or mix into a fruit salad. - Ask your practitioner for a glycerine extract (glycerite) if available. These are fluid extracts of a botanical or other medicinal substance made using glycerine as the majority of the fluid extraction medium. They have a sweet taste and make it much easier for children or those intolerant to alcohol. "}
