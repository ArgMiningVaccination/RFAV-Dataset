However, people may experience nutrient deficiencies or become weakened due to adverse environmental factors such as improper diets, chemicals laden foods, increased bodily free radicals, stress, sleep deprivation, etc. Such factors can debilitate our immune system, worsen our health, and adversely affect our well-being. What happens when our immune system is weak? A weak immune system cannot effectively defend against viruses, bacteria, and free radicals. Hence, if you experience sickness, fatigue, or tiredness, these may be manifestations of a weakened immune system, which can easily lead to infection susceptibility and severe health issues. Typically, white blood cells, antibodies, lymph nodes, and internal organs contribute to our body's immunity. Therefore, an immunocompromised person will have a high risk of infection, pneumonia, and low immunity due to a weak immune system. Signs and symptoms of a weak immune system The primary symptoms of a person with a weakened immune system can range from mild to severe, depending on an individual's condition. Symptoms may develop slowly but eventually emerge when instigated by precipitating factors such as bacteria, germs, or viruses. As a result, individuals with a weak immune system may find it hard to fend off infections compared with those with a healthier immune system. Common signs of a weak immune system include: - Fatigue, tiredness - Dizziness - Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet - Shortness of breath - Dull or dry skin - Muscle weakness - Forgetfulness Infectious diseases in patients with a weak immune system include: - Pneumonia - Bronchitis - Meningitis - Skin infections Essential vitamins and nutrients capable of boosting the immune system Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients for our body's immune system in defending and protecting our body against disease and free radicals. Foods containing vitamins and minerals are vital in helping boost our immune systems and effectively prevent colds, flu, and other infectious diseases. Regular improper nutritional consumption might supply an inadequate amount of the recommended daily dietary allowances of essential vitamins and minerals. Without crucial vitamins, the red blood cells cannot function optimally, impairing oxygen-carrying capacity. Vitamins and nutrients boosting that immune system include: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) - Vitamin C is an antioxidant that can help protect our cells against COVID-19 infection and reduces its severity. In addition, vitamin C enhances T-lymphocyte function, strengthens our respiratory and systemic infection resistance by improving various immune cell functions, forms blood vessels, and helps absorb iron. Ultimately, vitamin C boosts our immune system, generates collagen in our bones and muscles, and strengthens our body's healing process. - Foods containing vitamin C include citrus, kiwi, lemon, grapefruit, berries, tomatoes, etc. Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) - Vitamin D 3 is the most essential and powerful immune booster. Refer to as a sunshine vitamin, the cholesterol derivative -- 7-dehydrocholesterol -- in the skin forms vitamin D 3 precursor upon exposure to ultraviolet B rays in the sunlight. However, above the 35th latitude, the strength of the UVB spectrum is insufficient to cause the synthesis of vitamin D throughout the day during the winter months. In the tropics, early morning or late afternoon sunlight are insufficient to cause synthesis of vitamin D. - The receptor for the active form of vitamin D 3, 1,25(OH)2D(calcitriol), VDR, is a transcription factor regulating the expression of hundreds of genes. Every type of immune cell has VDR. - Food sources of vitamin D 3 are limited but include oily deep-sea fish such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, and tuna. Many will need to take supplements. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) - N-acetyl cysteine is a precursor to glutathione, an antioxidant that boosts our immune system, inhibits viral replication, and reduces inflammation. - Foods containing N-acetyl cysteine include broccoli, nuts, eggs, cauliflower, fish, chicken, etc. Vitamin B Complex - Vitamin B complex includes all the essential B vitamins that act synergistically to benefit the immune system, nervous system, and organ functions, including the brain, nervous system, cardiovascular system, muscle, skin, etc. - Foods containing the vitamin B complex include eggs, milk, tuna, liver, oysters, mackerel, spinach, kale, etc. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) - Vitamin B6 is a necessary co-factor for diverse biochemical reactions of cellular metabolism. Vitamin B6 is essential for normal brain functions, a healthy immune system, including its maintenance, and the production of new red blood cells for transporting oxygen throughout the body. - Foods containing vitamin B-6 include tuna, salmon, chicken, peas, dark green leafy vegetables, bananas, oranges, etc. Zinc - Zinc is a component of many enzymes that aid the functioning of genes and hormones critical for vision, smell, taste, reproductive function, and boosting the immune system. Zinc plays a vital role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. - Sources of foods that are rich in zinc include lean meat, seafood, yogurts, milk, and hard shell nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, cashews, and oats. Magnesium - Magnesium is involved in hundreds of enzyme systems that support the functioning of the immune system, maintain bone and muscle functions, and sustain overall body function, including brain functions, the heart, and the circulation system while controlling blood pressure and heart rate in the normal range. - Foods containing magnesium include green leafy vegetables, nuts, peas, beans, cereal grains, etc. How to boost your immune system and stay healthy? Health is wealth\u2014the most invaluable asset humans can possess. Living in a state of well-being and health is the most coveted aspiration achievable by adhering to a healthy lifestyle. Eating food with healthful nutrients, participating in regular exercise, and getting adequate sleep can boost and maintain our immune systems. However, a weak immune system from inadequate nutrients can occur, particularly during the Covid pandemic. If you have symptoms of a weak immune system, consult a doctor to assess your condition and receive treatment to regain a healthy immune system\u2014one of the main factors that help us stay strong, prevent infection, and live healthily for good through this pandemic.
