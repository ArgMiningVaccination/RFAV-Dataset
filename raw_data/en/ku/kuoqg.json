GMHHC conducted community stakehol der interviews in partnership with Adventist Health Glendale to obtain input on health needs, barriers to ca re and resources available to address the identif ied health needs. Twenty-three (23) interviews were completed November 2021 to Januar y 2022. Community stakeholders identified by the hospital were contacted and asked to participate in the intervi ews. Interviewees included individuals who are leaders and r epresentatives of med ically underserved, low- income, and minority populations , or local health or other depa rtments or agencies that have \"current data or other inf ormation relevant to the health needs of the community served by the hospital facility.\" GMHHC also conducted a survey wit h community residents to obtai n input on health needs, barriers to care and resour ces available to address the identified health needs. The survey was available in an electronic format through a Surv eyMonkey link. The survey was available in English , Spanish and Armenian and was c ollected from January 17 to February 15, 2022. During th is time, 33 community members completed the survey. Adventist Health conducted seven focus groups from 1/19/22 to 2 /9/22 that engaged 64 persons. The Adventist Hospital Community Wellbeing Director wa s responsible for identifying participants and sc heduling the focus groups. Socia l service providers in the Glendale community were eligible fo r inclusion in the focus gro ups.

Interviews with co mmunity stakeholders were used to gather input and prioritize the significant heal th needs. The following criteria were used to prioritize the health needs: The perceived severity of a heal th or community issue as it af fects the health and lives of those in the community. Improving or worsening of an issue in the community. Availability of resource s to address the need. The level of importance the hos pital should place on addressin g the issue. The interviewees were also aske d to prioritize the health needs according to highest level of importance in the co mmunity. The total score for each significant health need (possible score of 4) was divi ded by the total number of respon ses for which data were provided, resulting in an over all score for each need. Input fr om the community surveys and focus groups were also ta ken into consideration. List of Prioritized Si gnificant Health Needs Mental health, access to care, c hronic disease and COVID-19 wer e identified as priority needs in the service area. Mental health - Frequen t Mental Distress is defined as 14 or mo re bad mental health days in the last month. In the se rvice area, the rate of mental distress among adults was 13.1%. 26.3% of SPA 2 teens and 16.8% of SPA 4 teens needed hel p for emotional or mental health probl ems in the past year. 19.1% of adults in SPA 2 and 24.4% in SPA 4 needed help for emotional-mental and/or alcohol-drug related is sues in the past year. Among those adults who sought hel p, 53.6% in SPA 2 and 55.2% in SPA 4 received treatment. Access to health care - Health i nsurance coverage is considered a key component to ensure access to health care. The Healthy People 2030 objective for health insurance is 92.1% coverage. 90.4% of the civ ilian, non-institutionalized po pulation in the service area has health insurance and 96.4 % of children, ages 18 and yo unger, have health insurance coverage in the serv ice area.

Community stakeholders noted tha t COVID-19 has impacted every s egment of the community. Community residents were also a sked to prioritize the significa nt needs through a survey by indicating the level of importance the hospital shoul d place on addressing these community needs. The percent age of persons who identified a need as very important or important was divid ed by the total number of respo nses for which a response was provided, resulting in an overall percentage score for each significant need. The survey respondents listed the top five community need s as access to health care, senior health, chronic condi tions, COVID-19 and mental he alth. Focus group participants were also requested to identify the priority needs in the community. Mental health, access to care and housing and homelessness were mentio ned by a number of focus groups. Resources Potentially Available to Address Needs Community stakeholders identifie d community resources potential ly available to address the identified community needs.

Followi ng are their comments, which h ave been summarized and edited for clarity: Housing prices have skyrocket ed in the past five years. A one- bedroom apartment used to be $1,450 a month now i t is $1,800 to $1,900 a month. F amilies cannot afford housing anymore in our c ommunity and it is pushing peopl e out and causing homelessness. A high number o f people are double and tripled up in a house or apartment, just trying to make ends meet and that is not health y. That impacts people's mental health. Domestic violence is a big iss ue as well. People are fleeing a busers and that causes homelessness. It is sad to see families with generations of his tory here because they can no longer afford to live here. It is impossible to find housing in our town that is reasonabl y priced so that compounds the issues. And if you a re on the street and not taki ng care of yourself, one issue leads to another. If people lose their income, they lose their house and that is half of the problem. The other half is the mental health issues. And if we do not have w raparound services available and transit ional housing and all th ree of those worki ng together, that creates a bigger problem. A significant number of child ren are unhoused but they don't c ommunicate that to us. We also have many families t hat live in the same apartment and that creates health challenges and mental health challenges. Seniors don't make enough with socia l security and disability checks. They can't afford rent or make ends mee t with other expenses. Many of thes e seniors are in a very precarious position. They tr y to do roommate situations, o r they try to move to the high desert where it is le ss expensive, but they don't want to leave because their pg. 36 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center contacts and doctors are here. If people cannot be directed in th eir mental health care, they end up on the street and that creates a whole new lev el of care and a myriad of chal lenges. We underestimate the number of people who are homeless when we only look at those on the streets. A lot of people are living in their cars, living in shared spaces with many others in the same apar tment, or other dwelling situa tion that is designed for one family, not 3 or 4 crow ded into that same space. Our ho meless challenge is much larger than what our census indicates. In the housing market, you can build luxury or moderate priced housing, but no one can build affordable housing and make it work economically. The bare bones cost of building housing exceeds what peopl e can afford so housing must be subsidized. That is what is driving housing , the amount it costs to build s omething that is modest compared to high end is not that different. About 12% of our city receives financial assistance in their h ousing, which shows the significant need. There was a time that blue collar jobs were s omething that could support a family. But, for many r easons, those jobs have gone a way and we've got ourselves into this bind wit h a $15 minimum wage job. There are many people who are ta king advantage of not having t o pay their rent and I feel bad for landlords w ho have mortgages to pay. The system is built to discrimi nate against people of color an d LGBTQ folks and that all leads to general homelessness and it is something we have t o address on a broad level. Finding housing is a critical final step, but prev enting it is what we all must take on together. We are dealing with people who are tapped out and are chronica lly homeless. Literally, they have no options and are sleeping where it is no t meant for human habitation. Getting someone enough income to sustain themselves and find a living situation they can afford, that is key.

Following ar e their comments, which have b een summarized and edited for clarity: There are too many guns on t he streets and in the wrong hands. We need increased support for law enforcement to address indiv iduals who are breaking laws and cr eating problems. The schools have received a lo t of fake threats, which trigger s mental health issues. People post random fake threats and it is disturbing but we can 't make assumptions of what is real and fake, so we w ork closely with the police an d mental health department to investigate and res earch individuals who post the se threats of violence against the schools. We see financial abuse with our seniors. It is a huge factor in Asian c ountries. Culturally, it is okay to get punishment if you do something wrong. A lot of Asians a re very religious, so we work with a lot of faith leaders to educate on mental heal th, domestic violence and fost er care. A lot of people respect their religious l eaders more than anyone else, a nd rely on them before seeking out a professional. pg. 43 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center We have our share of persons who are homeless and some of them have mental health issues and have engaged in violent behavior. There seems to be more viol ence and more angry people. People are less in control and that manifests itself as viol ence. I'm not sure why it is m ore prevalent, and people are angrier, but one of t he pathways appears to be paren ting and not holding children accountable for their actions. In general, the youth drive ve ry fast here and generally, the youth in this community are not as compliant with rules , whether it be driving or cauti on regarding COVID-19. In general, we don't see as much c ompliance here as we do in ot her communities. Glendale is known for having the mo st expensive driver's insura nce because people drive fast here and pay varyi ng attention to stop signs. Intimate partner vio lence within the LGBT Q population is quite high. And that has really increased during the pandemic. You have people in unstab le relationships locked in together for 1.5 years and there has been a big uptic k in police calls and issues around not having coping mechanisms. There is transphobic murder. I t has been the deadliest year on record for transwomen of color murdered for being who they are. Violence is about early interv ention at schools and churches s o issues are resolved before a person goes down the wrong path. If people do not have the basic skill sets to be employed, the n that limits their options to make money, have a fam ily, and survive. Violence is a multifaceted problem. It can be domestic viol ence and having people in tune to identification of someone who might be a victim a nd having the ability to refer t hem to resources or it can be gang related so people can walk safel y on the streets. T he goal of the police department is to prevent crime. They are not always successful, so there are plenty of opportunities to apprehend peo ple and solve crimes. Crime is changing. We have seen an upswing in violent crimes a nd robberies and auto theft. Addressing people who chronically commit crimes can have a big impact. People are using more drugs to s elf-medicate for their mental health needs and that can lead to more car acci dents, DUIs and overdoses. As people stay at home and isolat e more, domestic violence and child abuse have increased or at least reporting o f them has increased. If the p erson who is the primary abuser was usually at w ork and now they are at home, th ere is no way to escape that abuse. It forces peop le into close proximity and it makes it harder to get away. pg. 44 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Health Care Access Health Insurance Coverage Health insurance coverage is c onsidered a key component to ensu re access to health care. 90.4% of the civilian, non-institutionalized population i n the service area has health insurance.

Community Input - Access to Care Stakeholder interviews identifi ed the following issues, challen ges and barriers related to access to care. Following are t heir comments, which have been s ummarized and edited for clarity: We are a heavily Spanish and Arm enian speaking community. We ne ed translations so pg. 52 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center people are not left out bec ause of language barriers. We do not provide enough informat ion on health care access in schools. A lot of parents in Glendale have limited English skills but their kids speak English, so it is about educating the kids who can then relay that information to their parents. For persons who are poor and homeless there is a misconception that the hospitals are tied to the government and if people come to the hospital, they will get deported or reported for not being here legally. California has done a good job and rolled ou t many health insu rance options. But some segments of our immigran t population do not trust anyone a re still struggling. We must promote the unive rsal health care options. For those who have the resour ces, they can take advantage of t he hospitals in the Glendale area. There is a need for those institutions to find w ell trained and educated health care workers. Due to the diversity of our c ommunity, no one size fits all. W e have Spanish and Armenian speakers and a lot o f young people who feel indestruct ible. The nonprofit community is doing the best they c an, but with mental health is sues, there are so many people and the need is so great, there are not enough serv ices. Parents do not have time to take off their jobs and employers do not accommodate parents to allow them t o go to the doctor. We have three good hospitals. The re is sufficient access to he alth facilities in our community. I don't think our physicians are dedicated to treating or serv ing their patients. The attitude of doctors, it is very negative. There is a challenge for minorit y populations, particularly As ian Pacific Islanders and African American populations. T hey are underrepresented in our city government and, therefore, their voices are not heard regarding their medi cal and health needs. Caucasians and Armenians are we ll heard and represented, but ot her minorities do not have the same voice and pow er and are not a part of these h ealth discussions. A major challenge is a lack of nurses and that is causing burn out for staff who are still working in health care. Getting more resources out ther e in more languages is very imp ortant and can lead to early intervention. Some heal th organizations are hiring mor e physicians and administrators who speak more As ian languages, and that is a hu ge win for our community. When people come back from health care services and say they spoke my language, that is welcomi ng to our community. For dental care, people are f earful, so they just don't addres s dental issues. And the challenge is most people do no t have adequate dent al coverage. There are very few organization s that can provide gender affir ming surgeries. Access to the COVID-19 vaccine was good and we expanded our ca pacity with new medications. But at the same time, those who had less access to care continue to pg. 53 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center have less access to care and ther e are only so many hospital be ds. As there are improvements to trea t those with COVID-19, improving access to care for other issues has gone to the wayside be cause of the focus on COVID-19 . People who are shut-in or have mobility issues are not going t o access care. When people are homeless, they are worried about what they wil l eat, where they will sleep, and are they going to get beat up. As a result, den tal care is not at the forefront of their minds. It is not considered important in the hierarchy of what is important. pg. 54 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Birth Indicators Births From 2014 to 2018, there were, on average, 5,102 births per yea r in the service area.

Following are their co mments, which have been summari zed and edited for clarity: COVID has impacted ev ery segment of our co mmunity, from infants to seniors. Many people do not feel comfortable ge tting vaccinated and it is cau sing issues in our community. All we can continue to do is engage people to use safe practic es and precautions and get vaccinated. Mandates and incentives are only as good as those who are willing to step forward and follo w-through. And we need to make sure our hospitals have the supports they need and t he skilled labor force they ne ed to meet the community's needs. The information is constantly c hanging, and that is triggering mistrust. Many people already do not believe in the vaccine or they think they alread y had COVID-19 so they are protected. And there ar e many parents w ho are unwillin g to have their children vaccinated because of th eir beliefs. Right now, we hav e 91% of our staff who have had at least one vaccine shot. This is after a lot of pushing and vaccine requirements to maintain employment. Information is power and being able to have influencers in the community who are convincing about vaccinations and the value of vaccinations wou ld be instrumental to overcome our low vaccine ra tes; it needs to be nonpolitical. pg. 70 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Educating people to not be afra id and to follow the guidelines , that is the biggest challenge. people do no t understand that they are endangering n ot only their lives but those around them. With the pandemic, the number of people seeking out mental hea lth has gone up and I don't know if the supply can meet the demand. We had an o verstressed system before the pandemic. Now i t is even more challenging to get an appointment and navigate the system because t here are not enough providers to meet our needs. Our shelter has had to quarantin e five or six times in the pas t year because clients or staff tested positive. That i mpacts our services, operations and facilities. That means we cannot assist homeless c lients during that two-week cl osure time, and often it is up to a month, or ev en up to three months. Some of the most vulnerable were provided hotel rooms, but t here were still a lot of people who did not fit that definition and didn't have a place to go. In LA, we have 5,000 emergency hous ing vouchers. But there is never an adequate amount of housing, especially com ing off the rent moratorium wh ere people have now lost their jobs and became hom eless or are facing eviction. So, the homeless rate is going to increase in the next couple of months. The older Armenian popul ation is resistant to following any gu idance on masks, social distancing, testing and vaccinations. It reveals a great er hesitancy to follow and receive guidance, support and educ ation on medical issues i n general. Immigrant families that don't have legal status, they didn't g et any benefits or stimulus checks with the pandemic. T hey usually get paid in cas h, so this has impacted their financial stability , which in turn has impacted their physical and mental health. There is a lot of burnout and pandemic fatigue for clients and health care staff. It has been extremely disruptive to peopl e's wellbeing. We have made s ignificant changes to our salary and time flexibi lity, but it is still difficult t o hire because people are leaving for larger health car e systems and we cannot compete wi th these systems. We learned if we can't meet people and have a relationship and talk to people, it is hard to be a trusted resource. It is hard for others to buy int o what you say. But if you have a relationship with someone who knows someone, or a church or a homeowner's association, t hat is a way to do it. The pandemic has created a whol e host of new needs and issues and problems. But at the same time, it has brought i n new resources. However, non e of the previously existing issues have gone away o r have gotten better because of COVID-19. Non- COVID-19 issues have been deprio ritized and funding has been re duced as a lot of attention, time and money are focused on COVID-19.

Following are their comments, which have been summarized and edited for clarity: Promoting access to primary car e providers is key. For many chr onic diseases, the earlier you find out the better fo r long-term success. Also, st ressing the importance of going to yearly checkups and getti ng ahead of the curve is impo rtant. Obesity is our number one cha llenge that leads to other chroni c diseases as well as poor diet and not receiving en ough education on nutrition. Diabetes and high blood pressure are common with the Armenian population. Most don't go out of their way to cook a variety of foods and eat fr uits and vegetables. They are eating rice and pasta because it is easy but it has al l those carbohydrates. People may not know they have a chronic disease until they are seen by a doctor. And by that time, they probably were already sick for a long ti me and the disease was untreated. As a result, there are more serious health conse quences. With cancer, there was a lack of screenings and so now we are seeing a more advanced disease process. People wi ll come into the ED with a c ancer diagnosis and they need to wait 6 to 8 months to see a specialist. And th e number of specialists that will see uninsured patients is very small, so people will go to local clinics and the waitlist is very long. We see patients wit h diabetes not managing their blood sugar a nd patients with heart disease still smoking. pg. 84 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Chronic diseases are hard to manage and they take time, organi zational skills, and many people don't have t hese self-management skills.

Community Input - Overweight and Obesity Stakeholder interviews identifi ed the following issues, challen ges and barriers related to overweight and obesity. Following are their comments, which hav e been summarized and edited for clarity: Often people can only afford fast food and that leads to diabet es and high cholesterol. We are trying to increase aware ness at food pantries to provide fresh produce. pg. 88 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center When you are in poverty, you cannot afford to go to the gym or buy exercise equipment. They are often not eat ing healthy, rather they are l ooking for what is cheaper and will fill them up. One segment of the population us ed the lockdown time to get mo re in shape and the other half used it to get in wors e shape. Social media puts a l ot of pressure on kids and there is a lot of fat shaming that causes mental health iss ues. We want to avoid that, but still set examples wit h good behaviors and choices. We try to educate people to ea t better to help with their diab etes and high blood pressure. It is not so much obes ity but not eating proper meals and nutrition. It is a financial issue. We have seen an uptick in peopl e who are attending support gro ups about their weight. It shows that people are looking for ways to talk throu gh things and seek advice. We need more education and res ources in people's native langua ges. We need people who look like the communi ty because it builds trust. The y don't trust others who come talk to them because t hey do not look like them. That is why it is so important to have diversity and inclusion in your staffing. If you do not have the financial stability to go grocery shopp ing, it is hard to provide healthy meals for your family. Som etimes it is easier to purcha se fast food and unhealthy items versus fresh produce. Diabetes is a huge illness in Asian communities. With school closures, children di dn't participate in youth spo rts activities. We see a lot of consumption of p rocessed foods. This results i n higher incidences of cardiac cases and diabetes. The challenge is helping people to cook better food and have a ccess to fresh foods and affordable ingred ients and help people acquire a taste for healthy fresh food. For LGBTQ women, being overweig ht and obese is a common issue. We need to find effective treatments and ens ure they have access with insu rance.

Following are t heir comments, which have been su mmarized and edited for clarity: It is a complex issue that is compounded by drug addiction, pov erty, a lack of education, a lack of faith in the system and medical prof essionals. One of the issues is that people are service resistant, they don' t want the help which makes the problem worse. There is plenty of help there, but peopl e don't want it and they don't s eek it out and they are resistant when it is offered to them. The biggest issue is the societ al stigma around mental health. There is a lack of open conversations. People are res istant to getting help. Teen suicides and the relationship between self-medica ting and mental health in our t eens, and the opioid addiction, we need to have more frank conversations around thes e issues. We need to have sufficiently trai ned individuals in the commun ity to meet those needs and the financial support to e mploy them and make that ha ppen. Mental health concerns have increased with the pandemic due to isolation at home and financial insecurity. The mental health crisis is alive and well in our community. Sometimes people don't believe t hey have mental health issues. It can be difficult for a provider to convince them to get a diagnosis so we can help t hem. Culture is a big issue. We hav e a large Armeni an population an d our organization discovered that for many generat ions, mental health is not disc ussed among Armenian families. It is tucked aw ay or chalked up to other fac tors. We've engaged with younger people who are more open and can have a conversati on with their parents and grandparents. How do we e ffectively provide service s as a mental health organization to people wh o do not believe their mental h ealth is an issue and will not use our services? A lot of people who have mental health issues go undiagnosed b ecause they don't know they have an issue, don't w ant to go to the doctor, or don 't want the stigma. Access to mental health care is more difficult because many me ntal health pg. 106 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center professionals are not covered by insurance, or only accept cash payments. And among those in religious or ethni c minority popul ations in our city, mental health still carries a great deal of stigma. Victims of domestic violence ar e often low income and mental h ealth services for low-income individuals often in clude long wait lists. Also, the re is stigma. Victims of domestic violence are often bl amed for their abuse and it can b e used against them in custody issues with children. There is a deficiency in the num ber of mental health providers that are accessible for those who are uninsur ed or underinsured. Pediatric mental healt h has become significantly worse with the pandemic. And access to pediatric mental health beds is impossible; we have children who come here on holds and they wa it for 3 to 4 days getting no care because we don't have a pediatric psychiatrist. Social media has a negative impact on the way youth perceive t hemselves. There is competition to have the perfe ct teen body and the pandemic has exacerbated that reliance on social media for c onversations and social interacti on. The LGBTQ community tends to su ffer more mental health issues and we have higher rates of mental illness. We have lack of resources for me ntal health services. You can hold someone for 72 hours but long-term that is not a solution as people go from th e ED back to the street and the issue repeats itself. We need an urgent care center to deal with intermediate issues, a place to go for treat ment that is consistent. pg. 107 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Substance Use and Misuse Cigarette Smoking The Healthy People 2030 objecti ve for cigarette smoking among a dults is 5%.

Community Input - Substance Use Stakeholder interviews identifi ed the following issues, challen ges and barriers related to substance use. Following are t heir comments, which have been su mmarized and edited for clarity: People are using substances to deal with the pandemic and to fo rget about the difficult times we are going through. I thin k it is particularly impactin g transitional age youth, ages 18-24. We do not do enough to communica te about the long-term impacts from drug use and vaping. There is still a belie f that it is cool and we don' t adequately communicate how quickly people can become addi cted. We seldom hear how seri ous their drug addiction problem bec omes and how it impacts their lives. pg. 111 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center We have devices in our bathr ooms at the schools that sound an alarm if someone is vaping. We have put a lot of sys tems and education and campaign s in place to reduce the desire to vape in school. We see our homeless population self-medicating and they are in need of assistance. One of the issues in Glendale i s that there are not a lot of r esources or education for prevention. If someone needs help, t here is not a lot of inform ation to share. Substance use is difficult because people must want to help th emselves to get treatment. Prior to the pandemic , we used to refer people to th e Glendale Substance Abuse program but it closed a t the beginning of the pandemic be cause it was not sustainable. Many substance us e agencies have closed because of the pandemic and funding issues. A lot of Asian communities do not talk about substance use and misuse. It is typical for people to drink and smoke eve ry day. In Asian countries the re is no difference between heroin, cocaine, marijua na or even Adderall. They all d amage your life and reputation and people j ust don't use them. Our community just lost a 19-ye ar-old male due to an overdose. We have an affluent community that can easily afford to pay for their habits. It ha s drawn some undesirable activities to our borders. Our city council has ref used to legalize marijuana sales in our city, but it is easily available to have it delivered to your home or business. We've noticed that the consumpt ion of alcohol is relatively hi gher, particularly hard liquor. You see smoking here a t all ages. People know it is not healthy but it is very common. Kids are always curious and they don't hear enough about the i mplications of their choices and won't see the implic ations of their choices until m uch later on. There are not LGBTQ identified mental illness or substance abu se homes and inpatient treatment centers in the area. The issue has been people won't go into treatment until they h ave hit rock bottom, lost their job, were arrested , whatever that consequence was to get them into a treatment program. Today, with the changes to the law, people r otate through treatment facilities. The divers ion programs have evaporated. W e must have a system that helps someone get into treatment and help them solv e their problem. That requires funding and some s ort of consequence or ability t o oversee the program. There is a strong tie with subs tance misuse and dealing with u nmet mental health needs. So as there are increasing mental health needs with the pandemic, there is a corresponding increase with people self-medi cating to deal with that. pg. 112 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Preventive Practices Immunization of Children The rate of full compliance wit h childhood imm unizations upon e ntry into kindergarten in Los Angeles County wa s 94.5%.

Following are thei r comments, which have been su mmarized and edited for clarity: Seniors have pretty much been homebound due to the pandemic an d limited resources. Maybe they have a ca se manager that checks in once a week. They often need transportation and help making doctor appointments. A lot of them are alone; they don't have anyone, no t even an emergency contact. There are a lot of innovative se rvices, bringing health awaren ess to people in senior living communities and that has been successful. But having bee n locked up in senior housing and co ncerned about getting sick has triggered m ental health issues for seniors. Many seniors are not being visited by loved ones a nd grandchildren. We will see seniors with 13 diffe rent medications and often 2 of them are the same medication but one is generic a nd the other a name brand and th ey don't know the difference and no one has pointed it out to them. The income of seniors has gone dow n significantly with the pan demic and they are struggling. We are seeing a lo t of families who are no longer a ble to take care of their elderly family member who needs 24/7 care and they are br inging them to the ED or placing them in a nursing home. We are also seeing a lot more dementia. People are often hospitalized and discharged and they end up g oing home and have issues that would easily be helpe d with a visiting home nurse. Often insurance doesn't cover that. A home nurse p rogram would help our communi ty a lot. There are never enough senior r esources for physical or mental health. Many seniors qualify for Medi-Cal or Medicare but they are often afr aid to give their personal information to government al entities or hospitals so t hey don't get the help they need. Seniors on fixed incomes have su ffered the most from the incre ase in rents over the last couple of years. The cost of medicine and medica l care is daunting, even with M edicare. Access is an issue. We've lear ned that the LGBTQ senior popula tion really struggled with isolation much more than th e heterosexual counterparts. LG BTQ seniors don't have children and famili es, and with the AIDS crisis, this is t he generation that was decimated by it in the 1980s and 1990s, so the social networks they formed, many are deceased. It is very common that seniors don't have an emer gency contact or health care proxy because they don't have anyone. We see them s truggle with rebuilding their social networks. Sometimes we see elder abuse , physical, mental, and financial. Seniors have greater needs for so cialization and the COVID loc kdown impacted them more than ot her populations. Before the pandemic, there was dat a showing that more seniors are starting to pg. 116 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center become homeless. It is a subpopulat ion of homelessness that is increasing. Rents are getting so high that senior s are being priced out of housin g. For first time homelessness, statistically it has been somewhere around 30 to 40 years old and they got evicted and they can't aff ord rent. Seni ors are the mo st highly vulnerable homeless. They will have more co morbidities and are prioritized for shelters.

Following are their comments, which have been summarized and edited for clarity: pg. 120 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Glendale does a great job of provi ding awareness of preventive care. We are a strong community with hospitals , numerous nonprofit organizatio ns, health fairs and specialists. We have an adequate supply of vaccines. But it is about reachi ng out to hard-to-get populations and empowering doctors to talk to patients. Antivac cination propaganda makes it harder. We also need to get information out there in a s many languages as possible. People need incentives to mak e informed decisions about their health. And that takes money. We have a significant number o f people in our community that d on't believe in vaccinations and flu shots. That m ay be for religious convictio ns or a lack of information or trust. Preventive health is so import ant but we disregard it. We all know smoking is bad but people continue to smoke. We a ll know physical activity is important, but we still don't make time for it. We need services in the languag es that people trust and listen to like Korean, Armenian and Spanish. Generally, the vaccine has been we ll received and the campaign s have had a good response. But there continue to be those who are resistant. It is not as serious of an issue as others like mental health and homelessness. I think we are doing a pretty good job with it and senior services. Those who were willing to get v accinated have received the vac cine. And those who were not going to get vaccinated continue to refuse the vaccine . Glendale is less vaccinated than other cities. For mammograms and colonoscopies , people are starting to get b ack to that, and now we are seeing more advanced disease processes. The whole idea of preventive e fforts doesn't exist in our Asia n culture. We never prepare for the worst; we don't e ven have that concept in our c ulture. We set up a mega vaccination cl inic that was unsuccessful. We had to shut it down prematurely because people were not interested. Routine health screenings have ta ken a hit. People have put of f elective surgeries because of reduced beds in hospita ls. Surgeries for knee and hi p replacements that increase quality of life are not viewed as urgent and that has taken a toll on people's mental health. We have vaccines and people can get vaccinated anywhere they w ant; you can even go to the drugstore on the co rner. There is no waiting in line, access is excellent. We have come a long w ay from people staying up all n ight on their computers trying to check fo r vaccine availability. pg. 121 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Prioritized Description of Significant Health Needs The identified significant commu nity needs were prioritized wit h input from the community. Interviews with comm unity stakeholders were used to gather input on the significant needs. The following cr iteria were used to prioriti ze the significant needs: The perceived severity of a heal th or community issue as it af fects the health and lives of those in the community. Improving or worsening of an issue in the community. Availability of resource s to address the need. The level of importance the hos pital should place on addressin g the issue. Each of the stakeholder interviewe es was sent a link to an elec tronic survey (Survey Monkey) in advance of the inte rview. The stakeholders were aske d to rank each identified need. The per centage of responses were noted as thos e that identified the need as having severe or very s evere impact on the community, h ad worsened over time, and had a short age or absence of resources available in t he community. Not all survey respondents answered ever y question, therefore, the resp onse percentages were calculated based on res pondents only and not on the entire sample size. Housing and homelessness, COVID-19, acce ss to care and mental health ha d the highest scores for severe and very severe impact on the community. Ment al health and housing and homelessness were the top two needs that had worsened over time. Mental health and housing and homelessness had t he highest scores for insuffi cient resources available to address the need. Significant Health Needs Severe and Very Severe Impact on the Community Worsened Over Time Insufficient or Absent Resources Access to care 81.3% 26.7% 40% 46.7% The interviewees were also aske d to prioritize the health needs according to highest level of importance in the co mmunity. The total score for each significant need (possible pg. 122 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center score of 4) was divided by the total number of responses for wh ich data were provided, resulting in an overall score for each significant need. Mental health, access to care, chronic disease and COVID-19 were ranked as the top four priori ty needs in the service area. Calculations resulted in t he following prioritization of the significant needs: Significant Needs Priority Ranking (Total Possible Score of 4) Mental health 3.94 Access to care 3.88 Chronic diseases 3.75 COVID-19 3.75 Preventive practices 3.63 Substance use 3.38 Overweight and obesity 3.33 Senior health 3.33 Housing and homelessness 3.06 Violence and injury 3.06 Community residents were also a sked to prioritize the significa nt needs through a survey by indicating the level of importance the hospital shoul d place on addressing these community needs. The percent age of persons who identified a need as very important or important was divid ed by the total number of respo nses for which a response was provided, resulting in an overall percentage score for each significant need. The survey respondents listed the top five community need s as access to health care, senior health, chronic condi tions, COVID-19 and mental he alth.

Responses included: People need more educ ation about available health services. Ed ucation needs to be in various languages, like Armenian and Spanish. Issues related to COVID-19 and low vaccination rates. Homelessness impacts entire families. Mental health, primarily for teenagers. Needs for seniors and t he COVID-19 crisis. Access to quick, affordable mental health care. Lack of housing, having perm anent shelter, and mental health s ervices. Mental health and diabetes. Domestic violence. Access to care, insurance and t he difference in quality and ef ficiency of care based on insurance coverage. The idea of getting an annual che ckup is not routine with many cultures. Prevention education is very important. Mental health issues in Asian communities does not exist. Ever yone is fine, no one has a problem. Mental health is very taboo and stigmatized and no one talks about it; it is a family matter. A large portion of our elderly population are immigrants with language barriers. Sedentary lifestyles. We see a lot of smoking in Glendale. There is a lack of prevent ive care that is cultural. Oral health and vaping. Vaping causes a lot of unnecessary adv erse health issues. The youth feel that it is cl ean and clear and n on-odorous and t herefore not harmful. Traffic and safety. Cancer is on the rise. Mental health services, hormone replacement therapy services, STI testing, primary care and substance use and misuse services. Homelessness, mental health issues and substance use. Stemming from COVID-19 and the lockdowns, senior health has be come a primary area of concern. Next, interview participants we re asked what factors or conditi ons contribute to these health issues. Their responses included: Before the pandemic, we were alr eady dealing with chronically homeless families. And now the pandemic has made it wor se. People are experiencing more mental health issues with the pandemic. Thes e are key factors in the p andemic and will impact our ability to bounce back. pg. 131 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center For persons with mental health issues and persons who are home less, it is due to multifaceted issues including pov erty, lack of education, and d rug use. COVID-19, the media, social pressure. Lack of information on the val ue of vaccinations, and some dis trust of institutions like schools, hospitals or city governments. COVID-19 exacerbated mental health challenges. People must nav igate the system and if they do not have insuranc e, the county system gets overw helmed very quickly. It is very challenging on a structural level. And cost is always an issue too. Clients don't know where they c an seek medical services. 95% o f our clients are Medicaid and they do not know wher e to go. So, they typically g o to the ED versus finding a primary care provider fo r issues that do not need eme rgency care. There is a need for more educat ion around mental health servic es and stigma. Culture and linguistics. In the greater LA area, there are 209 Asian Pacific Islander languages and there may be one docto r that speaks that particul ar language. It is hard to find a physician or nurse that speaks that language or understands well enough to speak the medical terms. For our children's mental heal th issues, it is the stay-at-hom e order and the lack of interaction with friends and nei ghbors and community as a whole . The attitude of a car culture, w here everyone drives everywher e and never walks. And technology allows that mor e now with remote meetings; peopl e may never have to get out of their chairs a ll day. Technology can negatively i mpact us. We observe a higher level of alcohol consumption in this commu nity. Also, we see poor diet and nutrition and lifesty le choices. As a result, we see more health conditions and diabetes. With the pandemic, people threw out their hygiene habits. We'v e seen a lot of cavities. Also, on demand access to food and the ability to con stantly eat and snack has resulted in weight issues. Housing insecurity, food insecu rity, lack of being able to nav igate the health care system, and discrimination and st igma as well as financial well being. A few years ago, the laws changed that reduced cr iminal penalt ies for substance use and it wasn't followed by anyth ing that put additional reso urces for treatment. The county jail is the primary treatment moda lity for those iss ues and that is not appropriate. The idea is to get iss ues resolved so people do no t enter the criminal justice system. With mental health, we have em ergency holds, but we lack resou rces in the community to provide lower-level intervention and assistance to people so they don't end up in the ED. Instead, we deal with it as a crisis. For those where the COVID-19 messaging doesn't work, the idea of repeating it louder and louder and more often does not result in higher vacc ination rates. We need to do more culturally com petent outreach and understand if people are coming pg. 132 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center to the conversation with a bias o r health concern or political issue. We need to figure out what speaks to them rat her than dismiss them. Environmentally, persons who ar e homeless are exposed to the e lements and to violence and trauma on the street s. What they are not exposed t o is preventive care and dental checkups. They are not eating well; they tend to eat a lot of junk food or skip meals and they may be using drugs and alcohol. Persons who are homeless have a heightened sense of anxiety and depression and that is e xacerbated by self- medicating and trying to cope. Who or what groups in the communi ty are most affected by these issues? Responses included: Seniors are becoming homeless a nd that is a great concern. It is easier to support a family and increase their income by helping them find employmen t. But a senior who cannot work, there are limitations on their ability for income generation. The cost of living keeps going up. Teenagers. Those who are historically underserved and new immigrants. Seniors and low income to m oderate income families. It is everyone who is impact ed by mental health conditions. Me ntal health does not discriminate. It may be more pre valent among communities that h ave trauma present or a factor in a person' s life may lead to depression a nd anxiety at any time in someone's life. COVID-19 has exacerbated ment al health and diabetes issues for everyone. Low income limited English s peakers. And first-generation Amer icans. We've found that the 2nd and 3rd generation who went to school here from an early age, they understand the concepts and they become more Westernized. First generation immigrant families are the most impacted. Mostly low-income families and families in the lower middle cl ass who have some income but lack health insuranc e coverage and don't have a lot of extra cash to pay for health issues on a regular, preventive basis. LGBTQ, people of color, trans f olks, immigrants with limited E nglish, and women are disproportionately impacted by every health condition. With mental health, no one is e xempt. Some might hide it bette r than others, but mental health concerns impact people across the spectrum of inc ome and class. It is more noticeable with those on the street because they got to a point where it is a significant enough issue that it impacts their ability to work in society in a normal way, sustain their housing and a job, and have positive and hea lthy relationships. Lower income, monolingual, and s eniors are always the groups t hat have the highest levels of needs. They have always had access issues, bu t when the normal population runs into access iss ues as well, for the more vulner able populations, it pg. 133 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center makes it that much worse for them. What health inequities have you obs erved and what solutions do you believe are needed to address those inequities? We need to provide more mental health opportunities. There are not enough services. And those that are a vailable, are not adequately mark eted. For those who are newly homele ss, trying to get back on their feet, with all these new barriers, it is difficult times for them. Barriers created by language an d cultural differences. Access to insurance and the shor tage of health care profession als and paraprofessionals. Workforce dev elopment is something we need t o address. We've seen a lot of housing and food insecurity. Approximately 30% of our college students have indicated hous ing or food insecurity. Access to information in the pr imary language is one way we ca n support efforts to increase equity and social eco nomic challenges. The languages I am referring to are primarily Armenian, S panish, and Korean. People do not have the knowle dge or education about their own health on what is important. Mental health is not something that is addressed as much as it should be and people are not referred as often as t hey should be. We need more educa tion and more referrals for mental health and we need a consolidated place to get information and referrals to help our clients. Access to care, and not being abl e to access mental health ser vices early on. Early intervention is key. We have a system that is set up to be in c risis mode and that creates problems because we don 't not have enough inpatient bed s and facilities in our county. Solutions are more b eds, more staff to handle the w orkloads and improving the way people treat a mental health condition when i t first presents itself. We need a more preventive and proac tive focus versus a reactive system. More overall education on what s ervices are available and ways people can access those treatment options. And fo r the homeless population, it is getting those people engaged and more mindful of their health conditions. There is a direct correlation between what insurance coverage people have to the quality of care they are getti ng and how quickly they are able to be seen. There is skepticism around healt h care and a reluctance to eng age is general with the health care system. There are a lot of long term and s hort-term physi cal and emoti onal health issues that can come up with being a survivor of domestic violence. Dispari ties with women's health is an issue and we need to look at the overall impact of the social determinates of health. We don't a lways look at domestic violen ce with a health care lens and the impact that can hav e on one's health long term. pg. 134 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center The biggest one is a patient's i nsurance. You can come in with the same disease process: uninsured or Medi-Cal o r PPO or Medicare, and your car e is dependent on your insurance and whether you c an easily access a specialist. With the pandemic and people losing their jobs, the first thing they dropped was their health insurance, so we are seeing more uninsured and underinsured. Barriers to language and finding providers that speak those la nguages. And also, because people are uninsured or because of their legal status t hose are barriers. Our aging population may not hav e the financial means to get t he best medical treatment. Glendale is considered unsaf e for biking and walking. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue. We serve a lot of immigrant fa milies and they often come with preconceived notions about how to care for their teet h and their overall health. Peo ple may need incentives to accept preventive care. For instance, it is very difficult to offer free preventive fluoride treatments in the community. But, if you of fer free diapers, they will come. It may be difficult fo r funders to see how free diap ers will help people come for free dental care, but it helps us to break those socia l barriers. There are not enough trans health c are providers in our networ k. Hormone therapy is getting better, but access for surgeries is still difficult. It is very difficult to find LGBTQ affirming specialists, particularly to see transgender pe ople. For people with HIV, it is hard to find specialis ts who are competent in this a rea. To make someone feel safe and be in a trustful env ironment, that is something t hat many patients lack. Finding ways to make sure health care can reach those that nee d it regardless of income is a challenge. How has the COVID-19 pandemic inf luenced or changed the unmet h ealth-related needs in your community? Responses included: It has heightened and worsened the needs in our community. We have a fairly low vaccination rate and our cultur al differences have been compoun ded by COVID-19. People are hesitant to seek adv ice and help from health practit ioners because they fear the vaccines. It had a big impact on mental health and physica l health. A lo t of people used the opportunity to work out. We saw an increase in mental health is sues. It has made jobs harder to come by. hours were cut back or peo ple had to stay at home to take care of the ki ds versus out at work. Those who have access to health care are hesitant to access ca re due to fear of COVID-19. Those who nev er had access, they aren't even trying t o communicate their needs. We have more requests for our nutrition program. We have seen a 200% increase in delivery requests. pg. 135 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Seniors are still not coming ou t of their homes due to fear. A lot of people sought out telehea lth and that was a positive. Lost jobs and financial insecurity are reasons why som eone might develop a mental healt h condition. It has taken a toll on people and their underlying health cond itions have been triggered by the pandemic. A lot of s ervices were closed or it took months to get an appointment. We are more polarized around w hat is science versus political persuasion. The stay-at-home order caused more domestic violence and peopl e were more isolated. As a result, the traum a caused by abuse was often not identified and or related to health, chronic dis eases, and mental wellbeing. That isolation impacted the ability to reach out to a doctor or talk to a friend. It has put them on a loudspeaker , and it has made them more pr evalent. It is common to see a lot of older peopl e with chronic health conditi ons living in cars because the housing situation has gotten worse. People's monthl y checks are not covering basic expenses anymore and people have transitioned to their cars or other alternative places to live. We are seeing this in people who ar e in their 70s and 80s. This is something that didn't happen before. There are more people who began to rely on science and get vac cinated. The influence from the Asian countries , like Korea, positively infl uenced COVID-19 testing. Following the rules and getting vaccinated created a r ipple effect for local immigrants. That is different t han going to a primary care prov ider. Going to a provider and asking for help didn't change, but the whole idea of getting vaccinated and tested, they trusted the science in that. We have been focused on how we keep people safe and vaccinated and getting people their booster shots, doing so cial distancing and revisin g policies on masks. That detracts from stroke aw areness program s and healthy heart programs and how do we create a pedestrian safe net work. We have refocused to mo re immediate things and that has been to the detriment of these other progra ms. There has been more access to tel ehealth care. Many patients h ad access to a visit, but the provider didn't see them, Some people are so terrified to leave their homes. They won't get their preventive care and we are waiting to see what the outcome of all this def erred maintenance will be. Zoom isn't a substitute for face -to-face interaction and expre ssion; people need that connection. It highlighted the unmet needs and it made a lot of things wor se. There are a lot of different needs that have gotten worse since pre-COVID-19. In t erms of access to vaccines, COVID-19 testing and pub lic health information, those have risen to meet the need. But the tide didn't li ft all ships. Some issues like mental health, dealing with a lockdown, uncertainty, and the rise in violent crime are COVID-19 related. But pg. 136 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center resources for COVID-19 were n ot focused on those aspects. A lot of persons who are homele ss got moved out of harm's way because we tried to better house them during COVID . But it took a ton of money and the success of those programs were a drop in the bucket with almost 70,000 hom eless in our county. pg. 137 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Attachment 4: Community Survey As part of the Community Health Needs Assessment, Glendale Memo rial Hospital and Health Center distributed a su rvey to engage community resident s. The survey was available in an electronic forma t through a SurveyMonkey link. The electronic survey was available in English, Spanish and Armenian. The survey link was available from January 17 to February 15, 2022, and during this time, 33 usabl e surveys were collected.

They prevent family members from speaking to doctors. There are not enough doctors. P eople get frustrated and contem plate all measures to get services. Even when you have good insuranc e, the appointment waitlist ru ns for about three months. There seems to be a lack of car ing for those suffering from me ntal issues. Patients with ment al illness need integrated services. Some psychologists will not ta ke insurance, only cash. COVID greatly impacted mental illness. In the Armenian cultur e, many stigmas exist. pg. 152 Dignity Health - Glendale Memori al Hospital and Health Center Alcohol/Drugs Many people are self-medicating with drugs and alcohol. Meth i s destroying our communities and more people are experiencing schizophrenia. Ou r communities need resources to tackle this growing problem. Treatment options are not there, the alcohol/ drugs are! We ne ed treatment centers! About 95% of the people who walk into rehab programs just leav e. We need to provide people equal s ervices with or without insur ance. The wrap- around programs are great in getti ng all the tools to survive a fter addiction, but private insurers will not pay for this. Parents and families do not have the education for their loved ones. Non-English speakers have a bi gger challenge in getting help, they are disenfranchised from the qualit y of care they should get. Homelessness With COVID we saw a shift in hom elessness. Seniors were left o ut of affordable housing and became homele ss in great numbers. Mental illness is a signific ant issue with homeless groups. Some homelessness can be treated with a mental hospital facili ty. "}
