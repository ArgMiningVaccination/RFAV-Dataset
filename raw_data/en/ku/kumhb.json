THINGS TO CONSIDER When treating stains it is always important to consider the type of stain, the type of material affected, the age and severity of the stain. Before treating stains always be sure to test an inconspicuous area for colorfastness. Remove excess debris and liquid before beginning stain treatment and always check manufacturer care instructions before use. Every stain situation is unique, so checking the care instructions of the item is key before deciding on what products and water temperatures should be used for treatment. Regardless, one of the most effective tips for stain removal is getting the item into water before the it sets. When unsure about water temperatures to use starting with room temperature water is a safer bet. TYPES OF MATERIALS Before treating a stain you should first assess the type of material it's affecting. Some materials are resistant to abrasion or can handle stronger cleaning agents while some cannot. Material-type will influence what methods, tools, and ingredients you should or should not use when treating a stain. NATURAL MATERIALS Natural materials include Cotton, Silk, Linen, Wool, Leather, Hemp, Jute, and many others. With an extensive variety of natural materials and fabric types it is important to assess each item individually before cleaning. Refer below to see suggested tools, methods and other important information about common natural materials: Leather: To prevent scratches, avoid scraping or scrubbing stains with sharp tools or hard bristles. Limit water contact and dry throughly when treating stains. Clean and condition leather regularly to maintain its natural luster and durability. Wool: Avoid over washing as it can damage the material and shape. Hand-wash whenever possible. Do not heat dry as this can cause wool to shrink. Cotton (Velvet, Canvas, Chenille, Corduroy): Cotton makes up a variety of fabric types with some being more durable than others. However, cotton can usually handle the majority of treatment methods required for most stains. Jute and Hemp Rugs: These durable natural fibers are beautiful and do best with regular vacuuming in low traffic areas. If stained or dirtied, scrape excess debris with dull knife, blot with white towel to remove excess liquid, or scrub lightly with a soft bristle brush when necessary. Ensure material is kept dry to prevent mold or mildew growth. Silk: Avoid all forms of heat and harsh chemicals when treating stains on and caring for silk fabrics. Check the labels of garments as individual silk items may vary in their recommended care instructions. Linen: Linen is a delicate fabric made with cotton or flax fibers that can become easily damaged by stains. Do not squeeze or press the linen as it can cause the stain to penetrate deeper into the fibers. Act quickly, shake off excess liquid, and gently scrape any debris away with edge of spoon or butter knife if needed. SYNTHETIC MATERIALS Synthetic materials include Viscose/Rayon, Spandex, Nylon, Polyester, Vinyl, Polypropylene, Polyester, Synthetic Leather (PVC or polyurethane plastic), and many others. Synthetic materials are known for their durability, but are often prone to damage from things like hot washing and drying. For synthetic materials is is always best to spot treat stains individually whenever possible, or set on a gentle cycle with warm to cold water temperatures and air dry to avoid damaging plastic fibers from heat.
