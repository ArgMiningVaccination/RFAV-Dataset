Manuel Nolasco Munoz serves as a bilingual patient navigator for the program, assisting with translation, making medical appointments, helping patients understand discharge instructions and plans of care and assisting with filling out forms. He will also work closely with the hospital's Community Health Department to assist at community outreach events and health screenings. \"The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected members of the Hispanic community, underscored the importance of providing culturally and linguistically competent care to improve health outcomes,\" says Tony Cava, President and Chief Executive Officer at RWJUH Somerset. In 2020, the hospital mounted an aggressive bilingual community outreach campaign in collaboration with a variety of community partners to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Efforts included distribution of masks, sanitizers, soaps, educational materials and personal protective equipment, along with promotion of COVID-19 vaccinations and access to them among the Hispanic community. In recognition of these efforts, the hospital was awarded the 2021 NJBIZ Healthcare Hero Award for Public Health and the 2021 New Jersey Hospital Association's Healthy New Jersey Award. The hospital also formed a Latino Advisory Council in 2020 with about 20 representatives from local government, businesses and organizations serving the Latino community as part of its community outreach efforts. As a result of input from the group, the hospital launched a new online health education series in Spanish for members of the Latino community, including webinars on COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine.

His voice slurred as he rushed inside to his wife. \"Call 911 right now,\" he said. The ambulance that quickly arrived whisked Anthony to a hospital nationally recognized for stroke care: Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset, which is certified as a Primary Stroke Center by the Joint Commission and the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, and was recently recognized as \"high-performing\" in the care of stroke patients by U.S. News & World Report. SWIFT RESPONSE The hospital had been alerted that Anthony was on his way, and an expert team sprang into action as soon as he arrived. \"We have a program where if we suspect a patient with a stroke is coming in, we have them quickly assessed by the Emergency Department [ED] doctor,\" says neurologist Srinivasa Potluri, MD, Medical Director of RWJUH Somerset's stroke program and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"If there are significant symptoms, we rush the patient directly to a CAT scan to look at the brain and exclude a brain hemorrhage. If possible, we also look at blood vessels leading to the brain to see if there are any blockages.\" Doctors ruled out a hemorrhage, and Anthony, whose right hand had now grown weak, was quickly given tissue plasminogen activator, an intravenous medication. Known as tPA, the drug helps dissolve blood clots that cause strokes. Anthony Maceiko of Bridgewater had two headaches to deal with when he woke up on February 1, 2021. The first was two feet of snow that the 48-year-old mechanical engineer had to clear. The second was an actual headache. He'd had it the night before, and still had it despite a night's rest. Heading to the garage for his snow- blower, something strange happened. \"I was putting on boots and felt drool coming out the side of my mouth,\" he says. \"In the mirror, the right side of my face was sagging.\" Having had first-aid training, \"I knew these were STRUCK BUT NOT STRICKENTreatment that took 33 minutes from assessment to administration of clot-busting medication cut short Anthony Maceiko's stroke.

Testing revealed Anthony had suffered a tear in one of two carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain. This had made his body form blood clots that in turn interfered with the flow of blood to his brain, triggering the stroke. Anthony quickly began feeling more like himself. \"I was improving by the hour,\" he says. Speech took longer to recover than hand mobility, but everything was getting better. \"Getting clot-busting medication helped with recovery,\" he says. STEADY IMPROVEMENT After four days in the hospital, Anthony went home and continued improving. \"In a week or so, my face stopped sagging and my speech was getting even better,\" he says. \"I was back to work in two weeks.\" People he spoke with on the phone couldn't detect any slurring, he says. With therapy at RWJUH Somerset, Anthony's hand strength and speech continued to improve. \"We conveniently have a physical therapy gym on the neuroscience floor,\" Dr. Potluri says. \"The goal is to have patients seen by rehabilitation services providers such as speech therapists, physical therapists and occupational therapists, usually the same day.\" The hospital also offers services for emotional needs, including a monthly stroke support group. \"It's helpful for patients and families to learn from each other, see what services are available and cope with any long-lasting symptoms of stroke,\" Dr. Potluri says. Anthony continues to see Dr. Potluri regularly and will never forget the outstanding care he received. \"From the ED to rehab, everyone at RWJUH Somerset was very attentive,\" he says. \"They helped me in any way I needed.\" Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

SALUTES FOR STROKE CARE Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset has been recognized for outstanding stroke care even beyond being designated a Primary Stroke Center by the Joint Commission and the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services and being recognized as \"high-performing\" for care of stroke patients by U.S. News & World Report. In September, the hospital received the American Heart Association's (AHA's) Gold Plus Get with the Guidelines\u2014Stroke Quality Achievement Award for its commitment to ensuring stroke patients receive the most appropriate treatment according to nationally recognized, research-based guidelines. RWJUH Somerset also received the AHA's Target: Stroke Honor Roll award, recognizing the hospital's quality measures to reduce time between a patient's arrival and treatment with clot-busting medication. In a third honor, the AHA gave the hospital its Target: Type 2 Diabetes award. To qualify, hospitals must meet quality measures developed with more than 90 percent of compliance for 12 consecutive months for the \"Overall Diabetes Cardiovascular Initiative Composite Score.\" BE FAST TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF STROKE Prompt treatment of a stroke is critical.

Center (ANCC) for the third consecutive time. The designation is the nation's most prestigious nursing honor\u2014one that only 9 percent of hospitals nationwide have achieved. \"The Magnet tenets are embedded in our culture and are something our nurses truly embody every day,\" says Michael Valendo, DNP, RN, NE-BC, CEN, Chief Nursing Officer and Vice President of Nursing, RWJUH Somerset. Tenets include exemplary professional practice, transformational leadership, shared decision-making and an organizational structure that empowers nurses. \"These processes allow us to achieve exceptional patient outcomes, which are significant indicators of nursing care quality,\" Valendo says. Key outcomes reported by Magnet hospitals include higher scores for patient safety, fewer complications and shorter hospital stays. PROMOTING HEALTH RWJUH Somerset's 650 nurses achieved Magnet status even while facing an unprecedented pandemic, continuing to serve a variety of roles throughout the Nurses have been called the backbone of healthcare. At Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset, they not only provide vital care at the bedside but also promote community health, improve patient care, enhance safety, support diversity and inclusion, educate staff, provide leadership and more.

The ANCC gave high marks for the hospital's use of business resource groups (BRGs) such as the Asian Society for Impact and Advocacy Network (ASIAN), Advancing Women through Advocacy, Recognition and Empowerment (AWARE), the Black Professionals Network (BPN) and Service and Advocacy for Latinos United for Development (SALUD). Such groups not only support employees, foster career development and contribute to cultural sensitivity, but also can advance public health goals. In one example, SALUD helped the hospital reach Latino communities especially hard hit by COVID-19. \"In cooperation with our Community Health and Diversity and Inclusion teams, members of the SALUD BRG participated in activities to distribute masks and hand sanitizer, and do community education about hygiene, transmission and social distancing,\" Valendo says. \"They gave away thousands of masks and interacted with thousands of people, and we saw a significant drop in hospitalizations among that population.\" \"It's a remarkable accomplishment for our nurses to be recognized as the best in their profession\u2014not just once, but three times in a row,\" says Tony Cava, President and Chief Executive Officer, RWJUH Somerset. \"We are so proud of our entire nursing team for their dedication to our patients and their commitment to providing the highest quality care.\" Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset's executive team and nursing leadership team celebrate receiving Magnet designation for nursing excellence.

Among them: Exemplary care: Magnet hospitals score well on quality indicators such as catheter- and line-associated infections, hospital-acquired pressure injuries and patient falls. \"Quality care reduces complications, hospital stays and readmissions,\" says Michael Valendo, Chief Nursing Officer and Vice President of Nursing. Efficient service: RWJUH Somerset had low rates of patients leaving the Emergency Department (ED) without care thanks to multidisciplinary collaboration between physicians, nurses, the ED and radiology and inpatient units to keep patient flow high and wait times low. Innovative practices: RWJUH Somerset nurses are empowered to provide ideas, solutions and leadership to improve care. For example, placing or removing an \"M\" on a board to indicate whether people understand a new medication has helped ensure that RWJUH Somerset patients know what drugs they take, why they take them and what side effects to watch for. Stable staffing: Magnet designation helps hospitals attract and retain nurses. \"Even during COVID, we've been able to attract talent,\" Valendo says.

Members of the LGBTQ community are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed as heterosexuals, and a greater percentage are uninsured, affecting their ability to get the medical care they need, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Now TD Bank has awarded a $150,000 grant to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset's Babs Siperstein PROUD Center to improve access to medical care for members of the LGBTQ community, with a focus on HIV prevention and mental health. The grant will also provide funding to help ensure more equitable access for transgender individuals of color who face significant barriers to medical care. About 28 percent of transgender individuals of color have no insurance compared to 8 percent of all U.S. adults. This gap in care contributes to an increased rate of HIV in Black transgender patients compared to overall transgender populations. While mental health issues are a major concern for the entire LGBTQ community, fewer LGBTQ adults of color get diagnosed and treated for mental health issues than the general LGBTQ population. \"The medical needs of an LGBTQ individual are unique, and far too many members of the community face extraordinary barriers to access basic medical care,\" says Michael Carbone, Regional President for Metro Pennsylvania and New Jersey at TD Bank. \"We know the support from TD will help the PROUD Center improve access to care and ultimately improve the well-being of LGBTQ New Jerseyans.\" EXPANDED SERVICES RWJUH Somerset's PROUD Center\u2014the first in New Jersey to offer specialized primary care services for the LGBTQ community\u2014recently expanded its HIV prevention services with the addition of a preexposure prophylactics (PrEP) counselor who provides PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) education, along with HIV risk reduction counseling. A therapist from the hospital's Behavioral Health Services also recently began offering mental health services for PROUD Center patients. In addition, the center's patient navigator works closely with patients to address gaps in care and connect people with hospital and community resources. Funds from the TD Bank grant will help ensure transgender patients of color have access to HIV prevention and mental health services as well as healthcare services associated with the transitioning process, including hormone replacement therapy. The grant will also fund webinars and workshops to educate hospital employees and community members about the unique healthcare needs of the LGBTQ community. \"Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset is committed to addressing healthcare disparities, particularly in the Black and brown and LGBTQ communities,\" said Tony Cava, President and CEO of RWJUH Somerset. \"This grant will help enhance our efforts to ensure that these underserved populations get the quality medical care that they need and deserve.

However, within a few days of birth, Frankie had developed severe blisters on her feet and was losing skin. Even routine screenings now posed a risk, and the baby was vulnerable to life-threatening bacteria entering her body. Her family was afraid to hold her. A diagnosis was needed, right away. Not long ago, genetic testing for infants could test just a few genes at a time, and results took weeks or months to come back. But thanks to a collaboration between Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine and RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH), Level III and Level IV NICUs in the RWJBH system can offer rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS). For medically urgent cases, preliminary diagnoses are available in three to five days. Using a blood sample, rWGS can scan a child's entire genetic makeup for thousands of anomalies. The test results provide vital information that leads to individualized care and fewer costly, invasive procedures.\"Rapid genome sequencing is a game changer,\" says Kamtorn Vangvanichyakorn, MD, Director of Neonatology at CBMC. \"It allows us to provide critical answers and targeted treatment at a time when the therapeutic window is often narrow.\" \"A SENSE OF RELIEF\" The testing revealed that Frankie has a type of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a rare group of diseases that are most often caused by a genetic mutation. Frankie's mother, Jeri Berinato, knew that her own mother lived with a severe form of EB, leading to constant blistering and pain, difficulty swallowing, loss of her fingernails and dental problems. \"As soon as we received the results, I felt a huge sense of relief,\" Jeri says. \"Not knowing what was wrong with my beautiful newborn baby was the worst feeling I've ever had. Now I know that, with proper care from the beginning, Frankie will have a much better quality of life than my mom has.\" In addition to CBMC, rWGS is available to critically ill infants at Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital; the Unterberg Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center; Children's Hospital of New Jersey at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center; and Jersey City Medical Center. The use of rWGS at RWJBH came about through a long-standing partnership between Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, the parent organization of Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, and Children's Specialized Hospital, an RWJBH facility. \"We're proud to be the only health system in New Jersey to partner with Rady Children's to offer rapid genetic testing,\" says William Faverzani, Senior Vice President of Children's Services at RWJBH. \"With this test, our physicians have access to cutting-edge technology, enabling them to intervene quickly to improve the lives of our tiniest patients and their loved ones.\" To learn more about rapid Whole Genome Sequencing at RWJBarnabas Health, visit www.rwjbh.org/pediatricgenetictesting.KAMTORN VANGVANICHYAKORN, MD ADVANCED GENOMIC TESTING RESULTS ALLOW DOCTORS TO BEGIN TARGETED TREATMENT WITHIN DAYS.

The technology for video healthcare visits has existed for decades, but providers as well as patients resisted virtual care\u2014until the onset of COVID-19 and social distancing. \"Before the pandemic, we were doing some virtual urgent care visits, but not routinely doing scheduled visits,\" says Andy Anderson, MD, President and CEO, Combined Medical Group of RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Health. \"However, at the peak of the pandemic we were doing 10,000 scheduled visits weekly, and even today we continue to do thousands each week.\" The increased COVID-19 created challenges that healthcare providers had never experienced in their careers. But the pandemic, while taking a toll on providers and patients alike, has also HOW COVID-19 IS RESHAPING HEALTHCARE ANDY ANDERSON, MD JOHN BONAMO, MD Healthy Together | 10 | Winter 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | AM12/10/21 9:19 AMdemand led to technology upgrades, he says, such as making it easier to have visits that include multiple attendees\u2014patient, family members, other providers or an interpreter if needed. \"Telemedicine has opened up access for patients, who can stay in a home environment to get the healthcare they need, whether it's acute, chronic or preventive, and that will continue,\" Dr. Anderson says. \"We're moving toward a good balance of in-person and remote appointments so patients can receive care more efficiently and effectively.\"2Increased awareness of preventing the spread of disease. In response to the pandemic, healthcare providers have redoubled their efforts to sanitize spaces and even filter the air, and the use of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes has become commonplace. \"We've always been committed to infection control through our system-wide journey to become a high reliability organization,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"We amplified those principles to keep our facilities even safer, such as using new ventilation techniques, employing UV-C lights to clean rooms, paying continued attention to visitation policies and more.\" 3Enhanced teamwork. \"At the peak of the pandemic, the needs were so great that our people began working together much more collaboratively,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"Instead of staying in their own lane and handing off a patient or a procedure to a specialist, providers worked together\u2014respiratory therapists teamed with nurses, primary care doctors worked in intensive care units at the elbow of intensivists, and so on. We learned how professionals can be 'skilled up' and trained to help in a crisis, and that has broken down levels of hierarchy and increased esprit de corps.\" 4An emphasis on mental well-being. \"Mental health has become a bigger issue due to the pandemic. People are afraid of becoming ill, they may have greater financial burdens and they're missing social interaction,\" says Dr. Anderson. \"Our behavioral health providers have been very busy.\" All kinds of healthcare providers are tuning in to their patients' state of mind. \"As doctors, we realize the importance of reaching out to people and asking them how they've been doing during the pandemic,\" he says. \"Everybody has a story, and it's important for us to take the time to listen and, if necessary, become an advocate or a resource for the patient.\" That kind of outreach is equally important for people who work in healthcare, Dr. Anderson says: \"In the RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group, we set aside time each week to text or call people we work with to see if they're doing OK, and provide help or a note of encouragement as needed.\" 5A brighter spotlight on healthcare disparities. \"At RWJBarnabas Health, we've had an ongoing and important system-wide effort in regard to social justice and anti-racism,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"However, the disparity in the rates of COVID-19 sickness and death among people of color was so blatant that it brought many things to the surface and made us, as well as the healthcare industry as a whole, take a closer look. We've realized that saying 'we treat everybody the same' isn't enough because some populations have many more resources than others.\" To learn more about RWJBarnabas Health's Ending Racism Together initiative, visit www.rwjbh.org/endingracism. 6A new flexibility. \"Healthcare is intensely regulated, and because of that we have a tendency to be very prescriptive about what we can do and how we do it,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"The COVID-19 need was so intense that we had to learn to be more flexible. For example, medical-surgical floors were turned into ICUs and we learned, OK, it may not be the ICU we would have built, but we can make this work. A lot of the old regulations were lifted during COVID-19, which enabled us to be flexible, but some of what we had been doing was just a result of old habits. Now we've expanded our horizons and have become much more nimble.\" For resources and information about COVID-19, visit www.rwjbh.org/covid19.

At Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health, your child will get the highest level of expertise and treatment, right here in New Jersey.\" The pediatric hematology/oncology team takes a multidisciplinary approach to providing the most advanced treatments for pediatric cancer and blood disorders, such as complex surgical techniques, precision medicine, immunotherapy and innovative radiation therapy procedures, including the state's only hospital-based proton therapy center. In addition, as New Jersey's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rutgers Cancer Institute offers access to cutting-edge clinical trials and cellular therapies that may not be available at other programs.A HOLISTIC APPROACH The specialists at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBH know that, in addition to treating the body, it's important to pay close attention to the emotional and social challenges of the patient and family. \"A diagnosis of cancer turns a family's life upside down, so we have a robust psychosocial support team to address the needs not just of the patient, but of parents and siblings as well,\" says Dr. Cole. That team includes psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, social workers, nutritionists and educators. \"We're committed to keeping kids on top of their studies,\" says Dr. Cole. \"At Rutgers Cancer Institute, we have a full-time teacher on staff in the building on school days. I'll often sit with our patients and do math problems with them, though I suspect I may enjoy that much more than they do,\" he says with a laugh. He recalls a teenage patient who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common cancer in children but also one of the most curable. \"He had to spend the first month of treatment in the hospital, away from his support network of friends and coaches,\" says Dr. Cole. \"Some of the side effects of his treatment, such as vomiting, were miserable, and he was embarrassed to lose his hair. He was depressed, but he received the support he needed from our psychosocial team. \"I'm happy to report that he's doing much better now. He's back in school on a modified schedule and if he needs any continued support from our team as he fully reenters his routine, we'll be there for him.\" The $10 million in state funding was championed by Grace Eline, a 12-year-old survivor of brain cancer and a childhood cancer awareness advocate, and her mother, Aubrey Eline, in collaboration with the American Childhood Cancer Organization. Grace was treated at Rutgers Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital of New Jersey at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. AN INFUSION OF FUNDS FOR RESEARCH Survival rates for children with cancer have improved significantly in the past 50 years, but pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease among children. It is among the least funded areas of cancer research. Advocates cheered when a $10 million appropriation to support pediatric cancer research at Rutgers Cancer Institute was included in the New Jersey 2022 state budget. \"The funding allows us to expand our ongoing efforts. One of our areas of focus is research in children that will help reduce acute side effects of treatment and the risk of it resulting in long-term organ damage,\" explains Peter Cole, MD, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Embrace Kids Foundation Endowed Chair at Rutgers Cancer Institute, who is also Director, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Cellular Therapies at Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Dr. Cole's laboratory is also supported by the Hugs for Brady Foundation. \"Another area of focus is bringing innovative treatment modalities to children with cancer and blood disorders,\" Dr. Cole says, \"including cellular therapies like CAR T-cell therapy, blood and marrow transplants and immunotherapies, which use the patient's own immune cells to fight cancer.\" JODI CRANDELL PHOTOGRAPHYCENTERS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CARE RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey partner to provide world-class care to New Jersey cancer patients.

Winter is prime time for heart attacks, as research studies show and doctors know all too well. \"It's expected in the hospital community that we'll see a bump in the number of heart attacks coming in during the winter season, especially around the holidays and during the first couple of months of the year,\" says Isaac Tawfik, MD, Chief of Cardiology at Monmouth Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"It's been theorized that if your core temperature is lower because you're outside and not really bundled up, the body's natural response is for arteries to vasoconstrict, or to narrow,\" Dr. Tawfik explains. \"If somebody already has a narrowing or blockage in the artery, it's going to interfere with normal blood flow, and that's the definition of a heart attack.\" Ruptured plaque is another main culprit for heart attacks in cold weather, he says. \"Any exertional work that's heavy and not gradual, like HEADING OFF WINTER HEART ATTACKS ISAAC TAWFIK, MD Healthy Together | 14 | Winter 2022 RWJBarnabas Health | AM12/10/21 9:24 AMshoveling snow, puts stress on coronary arteries. If those arteries have plaque, it may crack or rupture, which can lead to a whole cascade of platelet aggregation and other inflammatory mediators that eventually lead to a heart attack.\" In winter, middle-aged patients\u2014 people in their 40s, 50s, 60s\u2014may be more prone to heart attacks than seniors. \"They feel that they're healthy enough for shoveling snow and other types of outdoor exertion, so they don't warm up first and may not wear warm enough clothing,\" Dr. Tawfik says. Unlike older patients, they may be unaware of their limitations, he notes, and may not understand the possible consequences of existing conditions, such as hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes or tobacco use. The risk of a heart attack increases with every additional risk factor a person has. \"All of this is not to say that shoveling snow is automatically going to give you a heart attack,\" says Dr. Tawfik. \"What we are saying is that if you have known heart disease, or one or more risk factors for heart disease, you should think carefully before going out to shovel snow.\"SAFEGUARD YOUR HEART How can people protect themselves against heart attacks in cold weather? \"Number one, make sure you speak to your doctor so that any risk factors you have are addressed\u2014if you have hypertension, that your blood pressure is well controlled, if you are diabetic, that your blood sugar is under control, if you are a smoker, that you are working on a cessation plan,\" says Dr. Tawfik. Stay warm when you're outside and take frequent breaks to go inside and assess how you feel. \"If you're breathing in cold air, it cools your chest a little bit. You don't necessarily have the burning in the chest that can be a symptom until you go inside,\" he says. \"Do the work in short intervals so you're not outside for hours at a time.\" Be aware of anything different in the way you feel. \"A heart attack symptom doesn't have to be chest pain, because not everybody gets that. If you're nauseous, or if you're more fatigued or breathless than you expected to be, those can be red flags,\" he says. Dr. Tawfik shows his patients images that illustrate their cardiovascular condition\u2014an X-ray, an ultrasound, a CT scan\u2014as a means of helping them grasp their risks. \"If I have a patient who's 60 years old and I can tell him his risk for heart disease in the next 10 years is X versus someone who didn't have those risk factors, they tend to be more compliant,\" he says. Dr. Tawfik advises his patients to consult their primary care physician or cardiologist before undertaking any high-effort physical activity in cold weather. \"It's like driving your car and putting a seat belt on,\" he says. \"It's always best to err on the side of safety.\" Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

Blood flow is restricted and the delivery of oxygen to the heart is reduced. The heart must pump harder to circulate blood through the constricted blood vessels. As a result, blood pressure and heart rate increase. A sudden spike in blood pressure, especially when combined with exertion such as shoveling, can lead to heart attack or stroke. Narrowing of or stress on coronary arteries may lead to plaque rupture and blood clots that block blood flow to the heart. Hypothermia\u2014when body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014affects the workings of the heart, nervous system and other organs.

Colorectal cancer is diagnosed at more than twice the rate of liver cancer in the United States each year and can be detected through widely available screening tests such as colonoscopy, says Eshan Patel, MD, a board-certified hematologist/oncologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset's Steeplechase Cancer Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. What's more, colorectal cancer is becoming more common among younger adults. But liver cancer prevalence has more than tripled since 1980, with death rates doubling in that time, according to the American Cancer Society. Both cancers deserve more awareness as fresh trends emerge, says Dr. Patel. He explains what you need to know about these gastrointestinal malignancies and how they're detected. Why is it important for men and women to detect colorectal cancer early? If you're diagnosed with colorectal cancer in its early stages, you have a high chance of being cured. A colonoscopy can detect growths called polyps that usually develop into cancer but can be removed during the procedure. So by screening early, you're improving your odds of surviving cancer or avoiding it altogether. At what age should people begin screening for colorectal cancer, and why have recommendations changed? National recommendations suggest starting screening at age 45 for those at average risk. For those with a family history, such as a parent or sibling who had the disease, screening should start at age 40 or 10 years prior to the family member's age at diagnosis, whichever is earlier. The recommended screening age changed from 50 to 45 in recent years because data showed many patients were being diagnosed in their early 40s. What are some symptoms of liver cancer? Are there ways to screen for it? In its early stages, liver cancer may not cause any symptoms; nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension usually happen in later stages. There's no screening test for the general population, but for people at high risk\u2014including those with a history of hepatitis, alcoholic liver damage or fatty liver\u2014blood tests and ultrasounds can look for liver cancer. Should any ethnic groups be particularly concerned about colorectal and liver cancers? African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer rates of all ethnic groups, though it's not clear if that's due to biological variations, different access to screening or other factors. Liver cancer is a bit more prevalent in the Asian American population, which has a higher rate of hepatitis infections overall.

Working in partnership with her multidisciplinary healthcare team at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset, Kalyani conquered her cancer with a double mastectomy, radiation therapy and six months of oral chemotherapy. However, she then went a step further. Kalyani decided in June 2020 to participate in a clinical trial that promised to boost her body's immune Kalyani Gadgil of Edison was just past her 40th birthday in 2019 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer after noticing some skin discoloration and changes in the shape of her left breast. A mammogram and other tests found she had stage 2 cancer that already had spread to a lymph node in her underarm. A later biopsy revealed her cancer had reached stage 3. Being so young, with a husband and two children at home, Kalyani had Kalyani Gadgil hopes to continue enjoying family life and exercises like walking and yoga after a clinical trial that followed her treatment for breast cancer.

'I WANTED TO DOEVERYTHING I COULD TO FIGHT THE CANCER' Healthy Together | 18 | Winter 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET RWJUHS_CancerTrials_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 18RWJUHS_CancerTrials_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 18 12/9/21 2:33 PM12/9/21 2:33 and help prevent the cancer from coming back. \"I wanted to do everything I could to fight the cancer and any recurrence,\" says Kalyani, now 42. \"My physician told me that the immunotherapy used in the clinical trial has fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation, so I figured if it's not likely to harm anything and may help prevent the cancer from growing again, I should try it.\" A WEALTH OF TRIALS It was Kalyani's medical oncologist who suggested she consider enrolling in the clinical trial, which was available through RWJUH Somerset's partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Rutgers Cancer Institute currently offers more than 200 clinical trials on a wide range of cancers. RWJUH Somerset is participating in about two dozen of these trials for cancers of the breast, colon, lung, prostate and other organs, says Maria Scibilia, RN, Director of Oncology Research at RWJUH Somerset's Steeplechase Cancer Center. Patients can benefit from participating in clinical trials that test new treatments by gaining access to top-notch medical care and cutting-edge therapies. \"Often cancer patients participating in clinical trials have exhausted standard care options,\" Scibilia says. \"A trial offers them different opportunities.\" In Kalyani's trial, researchers are investigating whether taking the drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae) helps boost immunity and prevent cancer recurrence better than having no additional therapy. Kalyani joins more than 1,100 patients participating in the trial across the United States and Canada. All have been treated successfully for triple-negative breast cancer\u2014a type of cancer that is estrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor and HER2 negative. Triple-negative breast cancer patients do not respond to treatments such as hormone blockers and HER2 blockers that are used in many other breast cancer patients, explains Heather Davis, RN, a research nurse at Steeplechase Cancer Center who has worked with Kalyani. Researchers hope that pembrolizumab\u2014already used in other ways to treat patients with a variety of cancers, including certain groups of breast cancer patients\u2014will be an effective tool for patients like Kalyani who can't benefit from using other breast cancer medications to help stave off a recurrence, Davis says. The trial will follow participants up to 10 years to find out. CONTINUING THE BATTLE During the trial, Kalyani received half-hour intravenous infusions of pembrolizumab every three weeks for about a year at RWJUH Somerset, finishing in June 2021. She experienced some drowsiness and joint pain from the treatment but no discomfort that exercise such as yoga and walking couldn't ease. Kalyani checks in with her doctor every few months and is thankful she had an opportunity to try an approach that may guard her future. \"It was great to participate in the trial,\" says Kalyani. \"Knowing that I was doing something more helped me mentally as well. I liked that I was doing something to keep fighting.\" Two years battling cancer and worrying about the impact on her family had been a nightmare. Now Kalyani says she is feeling great, has her energy back and can fully take care of her kids and home. \"I can enjoy my family again,\" she says.HOW TO JOIN A CLINICAL TRIAL If you're interested in enrolling in a cancer clinical trial, ask your physician if you might be eligible for an available study, advises Maria Scibilia, RN, Director of Oncology Research at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset's Steeplechase Cancer Center. \"Our physicians are very aware of all clinical trials we have to offer and which ones might potentially be best for a patient,\" she says. If your doctor feels you might be a good candidate for a trial, you'll be referred to Scibilia's team, which will further evaluate whether the study is a good fit for you\u2014and vice versa. If you're cleared to participate, the team will advise you on how to get started.HOW CLINICAL TRIALS BENEFIT PATIENTS Participating in clinical trials can offer patients a number of advantages, says Maria Scibilia, RN, Director of Oncology Research at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset's Steeplechase Cancer Center. These include: Contact with top specialists who conduct research, are highly knowledgeable about the latest treatments and can help patients receive optimal care. Access to cutting-edge treatments and protocols not yet available to the general population that may help patients live longer or improve their quality of life. Such therapies may only be available at an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center such as Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, where the necessary expertise, resources and equipment allow clinicians to do groundbreaking research and provide patients access to the most advanced therapies close to home. The satisfaction of not only potentially benefiting directly from an investigative therapy but also being part of a study that could help other patients in the future. Healthy Together | 18 | Winter 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET RWJUHS_CancerTrials_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 19RWJUHS_CancerTrials_Winter22_Final_10.5.indd 19 12/9/21 2:33 PM12/9/21 OFFERS POWERFUL TOOLS FOR MANAGING YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION.In the past, paper medical records were largely inaccessible to patients. Today, healthcare providers often store information such as health history, diagnoses, treatments, medications and billing and payments digitally. This electronic health information can be securely shared, creating opportunities for patients to participate in their own care. In October, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset became the first acute care hospital in the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system to go live with a patient engagement platform called MyChart. Sometimes referred to as a portal, PATIENT PORTAL THE PLUSES OF A Healthy Together | 20 | Winter 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET RWJUHS_Epic_Winter22_final_10.5.indd 20RWJUHS_Epic_Winter22_final_10.5.indd 20 12/9/21 2:37 PM12/9/21 2:37 PMMyChart gives you access not only to information about your individual care but also to powerful tools that can help you learn about and manage your overall health. MyChart is part of an electronic health records (EHR) system called Epic. It will roll out across all of RWJBH in several stages over the next two years so the entire network will be on one EHR system.\"MyChart equips patients with important information at their fingertips,\" says Jill Anderson, RWJBH Vice President, Patient Experience. \"Providing patients with information about their personal health record allows them to feel connected and informed regarding their care. That engagement empowers patients and builds trust so they're more likely to take an active role in their health.\" MANY ADVANTAGES You and your RWJBH medical team share access to your patient health information, making MyChart a hub for your care. Once fully implemented, the platform will provide information about services you receive anywhere in the RWJBH system. Providers will be able to view your entire RWJBH health history and better coordinate your care. \"You don't need multiple accounts or access points,\" says Harshal Shah, RWJBH Digital Experience Manager. \"Everything is centralized in MyChart.\" Created with input from patients and family members through a Patient and Family Advisory Council, MyChart can be navigated in Spanish as well as English. It also allows you to manage care for your children and other consenting loved ones from your own account. Here's what some of MyChart's key features allow you to do: V iew a wide range of health information: Records in your account include visits to clinicians, the names of providers you saw, summaries of what you discussed, diagnoses, prescriptions, scheduled screenings, family history, allergies and vaccinations. You can also edit certain information\u2014for example, updating your family history or adding an immunization you received at a site outside RWJBH such as a pharmacy. Get test results: Rather than waiting for a phone call from your provider, you can see test results as soon as they're available. Even if your doctor explains that lab tests came back normal, you'll get actual numbers that tell you exactly where you stand and allow you to track trends over time. Your account's home page can even be customized to show test results first. Manage appointments and prescriptions: You can request an appointment with a provider in RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group, schedule tests and procedures such as annual mammograms or change appointments already on the calendar. You can also use MyChart to request prescription renewals or report if you've stopped taking any medications on your list. Fill out pre-appointment questionnaires: Instead of filling out forms in your doctor's waiting room, you can fill them out online before your visit. In some cases, you may only need to confirm that the information you input for an earlier visit is up to date. Connect with your doctor: MyChart lets you send messages to your care team and ask nonurgent questions. The platform even allows you to talk face-to-face with providers via telemedicine from your own home. T rack bills and payments: MyChart will show any charges you need to pay and allow you to make credit or debit card payments online as well as ask any questions you may have about billing. \"As a high reliability organization, RWJBH continually strives to offer patients consistent excellence in quality and safety, and always seeks to improve performance,\" says Anderson. \"Launching MyChart meets those goals by quickly and easily putting trusted health information in the hands of patients.\" MYCHART: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Is my privacy protected?
