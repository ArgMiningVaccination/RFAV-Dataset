When you choose to become a patient, we then complete a detailed review of your history and formulate a customized treatment plan. We LISTEN and we look at you as a whole person. You are more than just your symptoms, a diagnosis, or numbers on a lab test. The foundation of our treatments starts with the proven, time-tested power of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

In our experience, optimizing a combination of therapies that address the root cause of your issue means patients typically see more rapid progress for their condition.

Prior to my initial free consultation, Cup of Life provided me with the most thorough health history questionnaire I had ever encountered. Upon arrival at Cup of Life, I felt immediately welcomed by Michael and Satya's caring presence. Within minutes of my first visit, I was given a personalized health plan which included nutritional recommendations, stress management techniques, supplements, and positive visualizations. Although I entered Cup of Life for fertility assistance, I was pleasantly surprised to receive holistic healing from the ground up, far beyond acupuncture! Michael and Satya definitely fulfill their mission to provide affordable care that yields desired results. After 3 months of weekly visits, I received a positive pregnancy test. I continued acupuncture throughout my first trimester, and greatly appreciated the support! My husband and I then moved away from New England, however, we continue to enjoy a healthy pregnancy and are awaiting the arrival of our first baby in December of 2021. We are forever grateful for Michael and Satya. It was a privilege to receive their care. We highly recommend Cup of Life for all manner of healing needs.\" --Emily, 36, M.D., Family Medicine \"My insurance company was not going to pay for my IVF cycle because I could not seem to get my FSH level below 15 and my day 18 estradiol above 100. After a few acupuncture treatments, I have been given the go-ahead because my FSH measured 8, my LH was 24, and my estradiol measured 336 today. Thank you so much.\" ~ S.C., 41, Psychologist \"Wow! I'm blown away by how much acupuncture is helping. My uterine lining measured 11 mm today. I have never had my lining measure above 8 mm, ever.\" ~ E.N., 42, Nurse, patient preparing for an IVF cycle \"I cannot remember when I have bled so little. After the first acupuncture treatment, my bleeding got lighter. After my second acupuncture treatment, I bled even less. I expect after this treatment, it may stop bleeding altogether.\" Mary --Patient with a long-standing history of continuous menstrual bleeding \"If you're looking for relief from pain issues, whether emotional, physical, or mental, this is the place to go! Michael and Trish are an amazing team! When you are with either Michael for acupuncture or Trish for Reiki you feel cared for and totally refreshed and recharged. Thank you both for doing what you do. You are both blessed with such amazing talents/gifts and we are lucky to have you in this community.\" ~ Amy, Small Business Owner \"It was hard to feel hopeful a year ago when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and degenerative autoimmune disease. My rheumatology team at Cheshire Medical is amazing, but my body has not embraced any of the immune suppressants we've tried so far. This past winter, I decided to access prolonged treatment from Michael. After two months of weekly treatments, my legs feel so normal sometimes I forget how much function I had lost. My arms are functioning better than they have since 2006. I have no more fibromyalgia and very little pain. Smaller changes also encourage me. My balance has returned. I no longer groan when doing routine tasks. I am not depressed anticipating more decline. I have hope now that function can be maintained. I owe such a debt of gratitude to Michael, his kindness, his skills. What a treasure his knowledge and abilities are for our community.\" \"Michael is extremely gentle and is entirely committed to making your experience comfortable & healing. He is very skilled at what he does and his treatments are extremely effective! I have been a long-time patient of acupuncture & I find Michael's treatments to be thorough & consistently healing. He also happens to be wonderful with children. My son LOVES coming in for treatments & has been feeling so much better! Michael & his wife Tricia are a gift to our community!!\" --Jennifer - 50 \"I came to Michael with weird belly distress of many weeks that Western medicine could not diagnose. After just a few acupuncture sessions and the appropriate herbs suggested by Michael, I am 95% better, and continuing to heal! The soothing ambiance is an important part of the healing process, in addition to the skilled, professional treatments.\" Susan - 63 - Academic Administrator \"What an AWESOME Healing Center! Tricia (Satya) and Michael greet you like family. They are a great asset to the community and bring healing, relief, and training to so many. Thank you for being a part of all of our lives.\" John - 50 - I.T. Director \"Michael and Tricia (Satya) have each facilitated and supported profound physical and emotional healing journeys for my husband and me. It is a blessing (and a miracle) to have them in our community. I can't thank them enough for the depth of ability and knowledge they offer at Cup of Life.\" ~ Gretchen \"I would highly recommend trying acupuncture and going to Cup of Life Healing Center. Michael is a very gentle and caring person. He is very knowledgeable and skilled in his field. It was my first experience with acupuncture and he made me feel comfortable and welcome.\" Melissa - 38 - Bank Associate \"Working with Michael has been such a critical part of my self-care regime and has made an enormous impact on my welfare. Highly recommend.\" Laura - 32 - Clinical Psychologist Here's How We Help Thousands Every Year With PROVEN, Personalized Holistic Medical Care (And YOU get to choose which therapies you would like to incorporate.) Gentle Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the most powerful ways to naturally stimulate your body's innate healing process. Once stimulated, the healing process begins repairing and restoring all cells and tissues. It is an excellent way to tune in the neuroendocrine system's function of balancing hormone levels and pain. Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal therapy simultaneously cures AND strengthens the body. This dual action is something unique to herbal medicine that makes it very well suited to treat hormonal conditions including thyroid, menstrual disorders, mood problems, sleep issues, and fertility. Nutritional Therapy \"You are what you eat\" is the saying. When your cells, glands, and tissues are fully nourished with the specific nutrients they need, these tissues naturally function at a very high level. This means you feel your best because the body's key systems are optimized. Relaxation and Stress Reduction General life today causes a stress reaction that will cause your endocrine system to go out of balance and cause illness. When your nervous system is calm, the hormonal system, immune system, digestive, and circulatory systems all calm down, too. This means a more focused mind, more resilient immune system, less inflammation, better circulation, and optimal nutrient absorption. Why Is Acupuncture So Popular?

The sterile, stainless steel, single-use needles are extremely thin, and they cause no pain because they are razor sharp and solid as opposed to hollow like a hypodermic needle your would find at your doctor's office. How long will it take to see results? People often feel a shift after the very first treatment. Acupuncture is a very powerful way to regulate the neuroendocrine axis of the body - which is how the brain and central nervous system talk to the endocrine system. And, most patients see significant results within 6 - 12 weeks such as return of regular menstrual and ovulatory cycles, increased libido, and reduction of stress and other potential symptoms of YOUR condition. Where do you place the needles? The needles are placed into strategic points on your body, called \"acupoints\" or \"trigger points\" to stimulate circulation, calm the nervous system, and have effects on various organs and tissues. Most of the points are on the forearms, lower legs, back or abdomen. Is there any risk of infection? We use sterile, single-use needles and we observe \"Clean Needle Technique\" so there is no risk of infection. Will I have to spend a lot of time coming in for treatments? Most of our patients are able to get great results with once-weekly visits. We can discuss this in more detail at your free consultation. Will I have to do some kind of horrible, super-restrictive detox or elimination diet? NO WAY. We are here to set you up for success. We find the 2 or 3 \"key leverage points\" in your diet and work on those. No impossible to follow meal plans or detoxes here. Will I learn self care techniques like meditation and special exercises that will help empower me to heal faster? Certainly. While we want to guide you every step of the way, we also want to empower you for this journey and all those following. Our program is so effective because of its ability to connect the Body, Mind, and Spirit. We feel it is a very important part of every person's healing for any condition.
