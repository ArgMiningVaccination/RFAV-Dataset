[CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) for everyone aged 6 months and older. If your child has not gotten vaccinated yet, talk to his or her doctor about getting it as soon as possible. Vaccines your baby should get During the first months of your baby's life, routine vaccines can help protect your child from a variety of serious or potentially fatal diseases. At 1 to 2 months, your baby should receive vaccines to protect them from the following diseases: 1st dose of 5 A DTaP vaccine is the best protection from three serious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis). All three of these diseases can be deadly for people of any age, and whooping cough is especially dangerous for babies. See Related: [DTaP vaccination](/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/public/index.html) 1st dose of 3 or 4 Hib disease is a serious illness caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Babies and children younger than 5 years old are most at risk for Hib disease. It can cause lifelong disability and be deadly. Doctors recommend that your child get three or four doses of the Hib vaccine (depending on the brand). See Related: [Hib vaccination](/vaccines/vpd/hib/public/index.html) 2nd dose of 3 Hepatitis B is an infectious and potentially serious disease that can cause liver damage and liver cancer. If babies are infected at birth, hepatitis B can be a lifelong, chronic infection. There is no cure for hepatitis B, but the hepatitis B vaccine is the best way to prevent it. See Related: [Hepatitis B vaccination](/vaccines/vpd/hepb/index.html) 1st dose of 4 Pneumococcal disease can cause potentially serious and even deadly infections. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protects against the bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease. See Related: [Pneumococcal vaccination](/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/public/index.html) 1st dose of 4 Polio is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by poliovirus, which can infect the spinal cord and cause paralysis. It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old. Polio was eliminated in the United States with vaccination, and continued use of polio vaccine has kept this country polio-free. See Related: [Polio vaccination](/vaccines/vpd/polio/public/index.html) 1st dose of 2 or 3 Rotavirus can be very dangerous, even deadly for babies and young children. Doctors recommend that your child get two or three doses of the Rotavirus vaccine (depending on the brand). See Related: [Rotavirus vaccination](/vaccines/vpd/rotavirus/public/index.html) Additional protection for your baby during RSV season Babies who are 1 to 2 months old should receive an RSV immunization (if not previously received) to protect them against severe RSV disease. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) 1 Dose RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants and young children. Those infected with RSV can have difficulty breathing and eating and sometimes may need respiratory support or hydration in the hospital. An RSV immunization uses [monoclonal antibodies](/rsv/about/prevention.html) to protect infants and young children from severe RSV disease. This immunization gives your baby's body extra help to fight an RSV infection. Infants younger than 8 months old during RSV season (typically fall through spring) should get a one-dose RSV immunization to protect them against RSV. This dose should be given shortly before or during the RSV season. Care for your child after vaccinations Call 911 if you think your child might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site. Give your child extra care and attention Pay extra attention to your baby for a few days. If you see something that concerns you, call your baby's doctor. - Read the Vaccine Information Sheet(s) your baby's doctor gave you to learn about side effects your baby may experience. - Swaddle. - Offer breastmilk or formula more often. It is normal for some babies to eat less during the 24 hours after getting vaccines. Treat mild reactions Sometimes children have mild reactions from vaccines, such as pain at the injection site or a rash. These reactions, also called side effects, are normal and will soon go away. - Use a cool, damp cloth to help reduce redness, soreness, and/or swelling at the injection site. - Reduce fever with a cool sponge bath. - Ask your baby's doctor if you can give your baby a non-aspirin pain reliever.
