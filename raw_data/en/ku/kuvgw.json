The Digest consists of summaries of all bills and concurrent resolutions enacted by the Sixty-seventh General Assembly at its Second Regular Session ending May 12, 2010. The summaries include the dates bills are approved and the effective dates of the bills. The Digest also includes an alphabetical subject index and several reference tables. The Digest is not a substitute for the text of the bills or for provisions of the Colorado Revised Statutes, but gives the user notice of and summary information on recent changes to the statutes.

H.B. 10-1168 Full compensatio n for injured party - limit on subrogation rights of insurer. Under current law, an insurer that pays benefits to a person who is injured due to an act or omission of a third party may, under some circu mstances, obtain repayment of those benefits out of any recovery paid to the injured party, regardless of whether the injured party has been fully compensated for his or her losses. The act limits the ability of an insurer to obtain a repayment of benefits, through reimbursem ent or subrogation, if the repayment would cause the injured party to not be fully compensated . Additionally, if the injured party has been fully compensated and the repayment is allowed, the amount of the repayment is limited to the amount actually paid by the insurer or, for health care services pro vided on a cap itated basis, 8 0% of the usual an d customary charge for the same service charged by health care providers that provide care on a noncapitated basis in the geographic region. Finally, an insurer must pay its proportionate share of attorney fees and costs incurred by the injured party in obtaining the settlem ent or judgment. However, an insurer may seek repayment of amounts paid for property damage or uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, and such insurers are not required to share in the injured party's attorn ey fees an d costs. If an injured party makes a recovery of an amount that is less th an the total am ount of coverage availab le under any third-party liability insurance policy or uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, the injured party is presumed to be fully compensated . A rebuttable presumption that an injured party has not been fully compensated is created if the injured party makes a recovery that equals the amount of coverage availab le under all third-party liability insurance policies an d uninsured or underinsured motorist coverages. Further, when an injured party obtains a judgment, the amount of the judgment is presumed to be the am ount necessary to fully compensate th e injured party. An injured party who obtains a recovery that is less than the sum of all of his or her damages and who intends to limit an insurer's ab ility to obtain repayment of benefits paid to or on behalf of the injured party must notify the insurer within 60 days after obtaining each recovery, and the notice is to specify the total amount and source of the recovery, any applicab le co verage lim its, an d the am ount of costs ch arged to the injured party. If the insurer disputes the injured party's claim , the insurer may request arbitratio n of the dispute within 60 days after receip t of the notice from the injured party. The parties are to jointly appoint an arbitrato r or, if they cannot agree on a single arbitrato r, each party appoints an arbitrato r and the 2 arbitrato rs together select a third arbitrato r to serve on a panel to resolve the dispute. If the arbitrato r determ ines that the recovery does not fully compensate th e injured party, the insurer has no right to reim bursem ent or subrogation. An insurer is preclu ded from bringing a direct actio n against the at-fault third party for subrogation or reimbursem ent unless th e injured party has not pursued a claim against the at-fault third party by 60 days before the statu te of limitatio ns expires, in which case an insurer may bring a direct actio n against the at-fault third party. The third party cannot add 2010 DI GEST 29 COURTSthe insurer as a copayee on any check or draft in payment of a settlem ent or judgment for the injured party. Insurers can not delay, withhold, or reduce benefits either because the obligation to pay benefits results from the acts or omissions of a third party or as a means to compel reimbursem ent or subrogation. Addi tionally, if an insurer obtains reimbursem ent of benefits paid, the insurer must apply the amount of the reimbursem ent as a credit against any applicab le lifetime cap on benefits co ntained in the applicab le policy or plan. The act d oes not affect: !Statutory liens granted to hospitals th at provide care to an injured party; !Lien rights of the department of health care policy and financing with regard to medical benefits provided under a medical assistan ce program pursuant to the \"Colorado Medical A ssistan ce Act\"; o r !Subrogation and lien rights granted under the \"Workers' Compensatio n Act of Colorado\".

The recommendations of the council to the state board shall reflect a consensus vote, and, for any issue on which the council was unable to reach consensus, the council shall provide to the state b oard the reaso ns it w as unable to reach consensus. On or before September 1, 2011, the state board shall promulgate rules addressin g each of the council's duties and recommendations. If the council fails to make recommendations to the state board by March 1, 2011, the state board shall promulgate, on or before September 1, 2011, rules concerning any of the items with which the council was charged to make reco mmendations. In promulgating rules, th e state b oard shall ad here to the following timeline: !2011-12 school year: The department of educatio n (department) will work with school districts and boards of cooperativ e services to assist with development of evaluation system s based on quality standards; !On or before Jan uary 15, 2012: The state board shall provide to the general assem bly the rules promulgated based on the council's recomm endations; !2012-13 school year: Initial implementation and per the council's recomm endations; !2013-14 school year: Statew ide implementation system per the council's recommendations.

The great teachers and leaders fund is created and authorizes the department to accep t federal grants for the purposes of implementing the provisions of the act. The act allows for moneys to be transferred out of the contingency reserv e fund or state educatio n fund in fiscal years 2010-11 and 2011-12 if $250,000 has not been credited to the great teach ers and leaders fund through federal grants on or before September 30, 2010. A school district board of educatio n or board of cooperativ e services is required to meet or exceed the guidelines estab lished by the state board when creatin g its performance evaluation system . Upon the adoption of the system based on quality standards, one of the standards for measuring effectiv eness shall be directly related to classro om instruction and shall require that at least 50% of a teacher's evaluation be determ ined by the academic growth of the teach er's students. The district accountability committee shall provide input and recommendations concerning the assessm ent tools used to measure student academic growth as it relates to teach er evaluations. For the purposes of measuring effectiveness, expectatio ns of student academic growth shall take into account diverse factors, including but not limited to special educatio n, student mobility, and classro oms with a student population in which 95% of the students meet the definition of high-risk student. Standards are p rovided for a sch ool district b oard of educatio n to use when evaluating principals. Teachers and principals whose performance has been deemed ineffectiv e shall be provided with a remediation plan that includes professio nal development opportunities that are intended to help the teach er or principal achieve an effectiv e rating in his or her next performance ev aluation. The act includes an appeal process for nonprobationary teach ers who object to a rating of ineffectiv eness. At a minimum, a nonprobationary teach er may appeal h is or her rating to the superintendent or his or her designee. If there is no collectiv e bargaining agreem ent in place, following the ruling of the superintendent or his or her designee, the appealin g teacher may request a review by a mutually agreed-upon third party, who shall review whether the decisio n was arbitrary and capricious. The decisio n of the third party shall be binding on both parties. If there is a collectiv e bargaining agreem ent in place, either party may choose to opt into this process. School district accountability committees are given the additional duty of providing input and recommendations concerning the development and use of assessm ent tools for teach er evaluations.

Probationary teach er is redefined as a teach er who has not completed 3 consecutive years of demonstrated effectiv eness or a nonprobationary teach er who has had 2 consecutive years o f demonstrated ineffectiv eness, as d efined by rule of the state b oard. The act requires teach er placem ent by mutual consent of the teach er and the principal of the receiv ing school and with input from at least 2 teach ers employed at the school. Each teach er employment contract shall contain a provision statin g that the teach er may be assig ned to a particu lar sch ool only upon the consent of the receiv ing school. If a teach er is unable to secure a position after 2 hiring cycles, he or she will be placed on unpaid leave without benefits until he or she earns a position, at which time his or her benefits and years of experien ce will be reinstated . Any activ e nonprobationary teach er who was deemed 2010 DI GEST 49 EDUCA TION - PUBL IC SCHO OLSeffectiv e during the prior school year and has not secured a mutual consent placem ent shall be a member of a priority hiring pool. If a nonprobationary teach er is unable to secure a mutual consent assig nment after 12 months or 2 hiring cycles, whichever is longer, the school district sh all place th e teach er on unpaid leave until the teach er is ab le to secu re an assig nment. If the teach er secures an assig nment, the school district shall reinstate the teach er's salary and benefits at the level they would have been if the teach er had not been placed on unpaid leave. The provisions concerning mutual consent placeme nt may be waived in whole or in part for a renewable 4-year period by the state board in certa in situations. Beginning February 15, 2012, probationary and nonprobationary statu s and demonstrated effectiv eness are allowed to be factors in cancellin g employment contracts when there is a j ustifiable decrease in the number of teach ing positions. There will be a gradual phase-in of the system by providing an employing school district, beginning in the 2010-11 school year, with the option to renew a teach er's contract on either a probationary or nonprobationary statu s or not to renew the contract of a probationary teach er who has co mpleted his or her third year o f employment. A probationary teach er who is deemed to be performing satisf actorily in the school years 2010-11 through 2013-14 shall be considered to have performed effectiv ely during the same school years. Beginning with the 2014-15 school year, a nonprobationary teach er with effectiv e ratings who becomes employed by a different school district may provide to the hiring school district evidence of his or her effectiv eness and student academic growth data for the purposes o f retain ing nonprobationary statu s.

Current law allows health insurance carriers offering individual health coverage plans and small group plans, as well as the board of directo rs of the CoverColorado program or carriers providing health benefit plans to CoverColorado particip ants, to offer incentives or rewards to encourage persons covered under the plans to particip ate in a wellness and prevention program.

A \"health risk factor\" is defined to include health behaviors, such as smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, exercise, and exposure to UV radiation, that are known to be associated with increased mortality and morbidity for a number of conditions. Licensed health care providers, community-based wellness programs, employers, and individuals particip ating in an individual health coverage plan are permitted to develop wellness and prevention programs for carriers to consider in determ ining the types of programs to offer to covered persons. A carrier cannot use wellness and prevention programs or incentives or rewards under such programs to increase rates or premiums for any individuals or small groups covered by the carrier's pla ns. Carriers may offer incentives or rewards based upon satisf actio n of a standard related to a health risk factor only if the incentive or reward is offered pursuant to a bona fide wellness an d prevention program and only if the following standards are m et: !The incentive is reaso nably related to the wellness and prevention program and does not exceed 20% of the cost of employee-only coverage under the health coverage or small group plan; !The wellness and prevention program is consisten t with evidence-based research and best practic es, has a reaso nable likelihood of improving the health of or preventing disease in particip ating individuals, contains culturally and linguistically appropriate programs and materials, and is not overly burdensome or a su bterfuge for discrim ination based on a health factor; !The program gives individuals the opportunity to qualify for the incentive at the tim e of enrollment in the plan and at least an nually thereaf ter; !The full incentive is m ade availab le to all similarly situated individuals, an d 2010 DI GEST 166 INSURA NCEthe program allows an individual or his or her health care provider to request a reaso nable alternative standard or waiver of an otherwise applicab le standard for obtaining an incentive if the standard is unreaso nably difficult for the individual to meet due to a medical condition or because it is medically inadvisable for the individual to attem pt to satisf y the stan dard; and !The incentives are provided based on a program or activ ity that is scien tifically proven to improve health , and the carrier does not provide incentives based on an individual's actual h ealth statu s. Prior to offering or providing an incentive or reward, carriers are required to submit proposed incentives or rewards for review and approval by a nationally recognized nonprofit entity that accred its w ellness p rograms. Additionally, current law requires the division of insurance (division) to collect and provide to the health care task force information regarding wellness and prevention programs being offered in the Colorado market.

Existing law creates a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) under which certain electric utilities are required to generate an increasin g percen tage of their electricity from renewable sources, in a series of increm ents from 3% in 2007 to 20% in 2020 and thereafter. The act boosts these RPS percen tages to achieve 30% renewable generatio n by 2020 and requires a portion of the RPS to be met through a subset of renewable generatio n, \"distrib uted generatio n\" act defines terms, increases RPS percen tages, and, within each RPS percen tage, requires an increasin g portion to be derived from DG (which includes customer-sited solar generatio n), of which half must represen t retail DG acquisitio ns. The 2010 DI GEST 222 PUBL IC UTILITIE SColorado public utilities commission (PUC) may reduce the DG percen tages after 2014, upon application by a utility, if it finds that the existing percen tage requirements are no longer in the public in terest an d, if the PUC finds that an increase is in the public interest, directs the PUC to so notify the general assem bly. The existing 1.25 multiplier for in-state renewable electric g eneratio n, as ap plied to DG, is lim ited to wholesale D G only. The PUC is given discretio n to increm entally reduce the existing standard rebate offer (which utilities must pay as an incentive for new customer-sited renewable generatio n facilities such as rooftop solar panels) from $2 per watt to some lesser amount if the PUC finds that market ch anges su pport the change. For large DG facilities of one megawatt or more, the PUC is directed to require registratio n with a regional system for track ing renewable energy generatio n.

VETOED by Governor June 7, 2010 H.B. 10-1342 Electric u tilities - ren ewable portfolio standard - reb ates - cred its - eligibility - community solar gardens. Existing law directs the Colorado public utilities commission (PUC) to adopt rules implementing the renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS) for electric utilities, under which increasin g amounts of electricity must be generated from renewable sources. The current rules provide for standard rebates for the cost of installatio n and renewable en ergy cred its (R ECs) to promote cu stomer-sited solar generatio n facilities. The act directs the PUC to adopt new rules under which standard rebates can apply to solar generatio n facilities that are beneficially owned by 10 or more customers at a shared locatio n, called a \"community solar garden\". This will help customers particip ate in solar generatio n even though solar facilities on their own properties may not be feasib le due to cost, the physical ch aracteristics o f their sites, th eir statu s as ren ters, o r other factors. The act amends an existing legislativ e declaratio n to state that it is in the public interest to allow renters, low-income utility customers, and agricultural producers to own interests in solar generatio n facilities, to make interests in solar generatio n facilities portable and transferable, and to leverage Colorado's solar generating capacity through economies of scale. The act also : !Defines a community solar garden as an on-site eligible solar electric generatio n facility with a nameplate rating of 2 megawatts or less and in which subscrip tions are o wned by 10 or more customers of a qualifying retail utility; !Limits the size of a subscrip tion to 120% of the average annual electric consumption of each subscrib er at the premises to which the subscrip tion is attrib uted; !Allows the creatio n of a community solar garden owned by a subscrib er organizatio n, subject to rules ad opted by the PUC by October 1, 2010; !Specifies that, in their first 3 compliance plan years after the effective date of the act, qualifying retail utilities must purchase the lesser of 6 megawatts, or half their total purchases of electricity from community solar gardens, from gardens that are sized at 500 kilowatts o r smaller; !Limits to 20% the amount of renewable energy credits generated from solar gardens that a utility may use toward the retail d istrib uted generatio n standard in years 2 011 through 2013; !Exempts community solar gardens from the definition of a utility; and !Specifies that the act does not apply to cooperativ e electric associations or municipally owned utilities.

H.B. 10-1365 Electric utilities - conversio n of coal-fired generatio n - natural gas or other low-emitting resources - cost recovery - appropriatio n. In order to meet reaso nably foreseeab le federal \"Clean Air Act\" requirements to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, all rate-reg ulated utilities that own or operate coal-fired electric generatin g units must submit to the public utilities commission (PUC) an emission reduction plan for emissions from those units covering the lesser of 900 megawatts or 50% of the utility's coal-fired electric generatin g units in Colorado. The plans have to give primary consideratio n to replacin g or repowering coal-fired electric generato rs with natural gas and must also consider other low-emitting reso urces, in cluding energy efficien cy. The PUC will provide the department of public health and environment (department) an opportunity to comment on the utilities' plans. The department will determ ine whether the new or repowered electric generatin g units proposed under the plans will achieve emission rates equivalent to or less than a combined-cycle natural gas generatin g unit and whether the plans comply with current and reaso nably foreseeab le requirements of the federal and state clean air law s. The plans are to be implemented by Decem ber 31, 2017. In evaluating the plans, the PUC is to consider the following factors: The pollution reductions to be ach ieved; the increased use of existing natural gas-fired electric g eneratin g capacity ; and the plan's effect on economic development, electricity reliab ility, cost and rate increases, compliance with renewable energy standards, and relian ce on energy efficien cy or other low-emitting resources. The PUC is to approve, deny, or modify the plans by Decem ber 15, 2010. The utilities' actio ns in complying with the plans are presumed to be prudent actio ns, the costs of which are reco verable in rates. The air quality control commission will consider incorporating the emissions reductions derived from the plans into the regional haze elem ent of the state implementation plan. Early reductions of emissions will count as voluntary for purposes of early reduction credits under federal law . On and after January 1, 2012, the PUC may approve interim rates taking effect no later than 60 days after a rate increase filing. A utility will have to rebate the excess if a final rate is lower than an interim rate. 2010 DI GEST 227 PUBL IC UTILITIE SUp to $74,115 and 0.6 FTE are appropriated for implementation of the act from the PUC's fix ed utility fund.
