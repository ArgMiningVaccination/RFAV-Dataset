Title: Chromium and Insulin Action Role: Principal Investigator Funding: $2,166,2 31 This study evaluated the role of chromium picolinate in improving insulin action in vivo in patients wi th type 2 diabetes. The study was a randomized, double -blind study evaluating the role of the nutrient on glycemia, insulin action, and body composition. As a key parameter of study, hyperin sulinemic euglycemic clamps were used to assess insulin action with skeletal muscle bi opsies. The s keletal muscle was analyzed to determine if the nutrient enhances insulin signaling. William T. Cefalu, M.D. 2019 11 Title: Combinatorial Library Screening J This project's overall objective was to develop high throughput screening assays using adult derived stromal stem cells to evaluate promising candidate agents that may have an effect on adipogenesis. Title: Chromium, Cellular Energy Status and Whole Body Energy Balance Role: Principal Investigator Duration: $588,000 This project's overall objective was to perform exploratory studies on the effect of chromium on whole body energy balance, lipid metabolism, and cellular energy status in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize d that, in subjects with type 2 diabetes, Cr will enhance cellular AMP kinase activation resulting in an increase in skeletal muscle li pid metabolism and adipose tissu e function. These findings will be associated with an improved whole body energy balance.
