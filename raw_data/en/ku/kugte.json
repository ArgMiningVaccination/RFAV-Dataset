You've probably heard of mindfulness meditation before. What is it really? Let's break it down. There are two elements to mindfulness. The first is about paying attention, on purpose, to your moment-to-moment experience. The second component has to do with HOW you pay attention. Mindfulness is characterized by non-judgment, curiosity, acceptance, and compassion. Jon Kabat-Zinn defines it this way: \"Mindfulness is awareness, cultivated by paying attention in a sustained and particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment.\" Offerings - Private Meditation Coaching We begin with six sessions to learn the basics of mindfulness meditation as a foundation to build upon. Sessions begin with a short guided meditation for grounding and centering. We then move on to the topic of the session and explore how to apply this our lives, before moving into the longer guided meditation to practice our skills. Once you have the foundation, we then work together to create the life you long for, using mindfulness and meditation as our main tools. - 10 week Introduction to Mindfulness Group COMING SOON This is a great opportunity to build belonging and connection as we learn mindfulness meditation as a group. Each weekly session will be 2 hours long with a short break. "}
