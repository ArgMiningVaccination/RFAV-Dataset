He carried with him into offi ce what biographer Ron Chernow called \"a panoramic vision of a diversifi ed economy that would provide opportunity for people from all walks of life.\"a Th e American War of Independence against Great Britain left us with crushing debts. On assuming offi ce, devising our nation's fi rst tax system was among Hamilton's most urgent and diffi cult assignments. Th is tax system funded the government and paid off the states' Revolutionary War debts, which in turn gave our young, vulnerable nation a chance to prosper. Th anks to Hamilton's foresight and political courage, America's course toward bankruptcy was reversed, we established our creditworthiness, and a strong and successful nation was built. When Hamilton left his post fi ve years later, interest rates in the United States were as low as any in the world. Th is book is about taxes. It poses a simple question: Given that the United States needs more revenue, how should we raise it? Th e answers come fr o m s o m e o f o ur n a ti o n ' s f o r e m o s t tax p o li cy s c h o l ar s an d e xp e rts . Th e Hamilton Project commissioned them to come forward with proposals to address our government's pressing need for revenue under the economic conditions that prevail today. Th e ideas in the chapters that follow focus on the central and most enduring questions about raising taxes\u2014who pays them, what eff ects do they have on the economy, and how much revenue can they raise\u2014questions that have animated our political discourse across three centuries. While every eff ort a. Chernow, Ron. 2006, April. Presentation at the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Inst itution, Washington, DC.2 to raise taxes provokes opposition, principled and otherwise, our current economic circumstances demand we take up those questions again. Th ere are a number of reasons to consider sources for more revenue. First, we have immense fi scal imbalances in the United States. In June, the Congressional Budget Offi ce reported that \"large budget defi cits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels\u2014from 78 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049.\" b Even in today's low interest rate environment, unsound fi scal conditions will at some unpredictable moment in the future constrain the ability of policymakers to address national challenges if the debt grows continuously and today's mix of revenues and spending remains unchanged. Second, these imbalances are driven not by ambitious new spending programs but by previous health care and pension commitments as well as declines in federal revenues. As contributing author William Gal e of the Brookings Institution writes, \"much of the projected increase in spending is due to rising net interest payments\u2014burdens created by defi cits from previous years\" (p. 198). T o be clear, savings in government programs can be derived from thoughtful reforms, and federal budgets must refl ect the necessity of stabilizing our fi scal position in the years and decades to come. Th e yawning gap between spending and income is due in large part to reduced tax collections. As Larry Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury, and Jason Furman, former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, wrote earlier this year, \"the federal government [in 2018] took in revenue equivalent to just 16 percent of GDP, the lowest level in half a century, except for a few brief periods in the aft ermath of recessions. Without the Bush and Trump tax cuts (and the interest payments on the debt that went with them), last year's federal budget would have come close to balancing.\" c Th ird, we cannot get back on track to restore long-term economic growth, address growing economic inequality, provide aff ordable health care coverage, combat climate change, and much more without restoring the nation's tax base. Simply put, we need additional revenues to pay for investments that will make our economy grow and enable more Americans to share in that growth. b. Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO). 2019.

How Washington Should End Its Debt Obsession, \" Larry Summers (blog).3 Fourth, most of these new revenues must come from those best able to pay, especially since tax cuts benefi ting the highest earners account for so much of the declining share of taxes paid at the federal level. Since the late 1960s, the share of federal revenue paid by working Americans in the form of payroll taxes has increased from just over 20 percent to 35 percent. Yet corporate tax collections have plummeted from more than 25 percent to less than 10 percent of revenues, d and the top rate paid by wealthy fi lers has fallen from 70 percent during L yndon Johnson ' s presidency to 37 percent today. e And over the last two decades, Congress has hollowed out the estate tax to such an extent that only 0.2 percent of estates pay any tax at all.f Th is has consequences beyond the bottom line. Th e tax system does far too little to address the concentration of income at the highest levels or fund investments that enhance economic and social mobility for workers and their families. In short, to stabilize our fi scal trajectory, whether to make our revenue system more progressive and growth-friendly or to fund new priorities, there is an urgent need to reconsider our current tax system. In the chapters that follow, we present our contributors' new proposals for a value-added tax, a fi nancial transactions tax, wealth and inheritance taxes, fi xing the broken corporate and international tax systems, and giving the Internal Revenue Service the resources it needs to ensure that tax laws, both old and new, are better enforced and administered and to remove loopholes and unnecessary deductions and shelters. Overall, these proposals are carefully designed and built on the best available evidence and analysis. Each was subject to peer review, independently and in conferences, where we invited authorities in tax policy, economists, and others to exchange their views with the authors. We are grateful to all for contributing their expertise and making each proposal better. Tax policy is enormously complex. Th ere are economic diff erences between\u2014and disparate impacts from\u2014taxes on capital, consumption, and labor. Straightforward computational questions can lead to contentious debates.

W e hope this book evokes an informed debate and prepares policymakers to act. Beyond substance, higher hurdles lie in wait. In every budget and tax debate in which we've participated, some policymakers argue that tax increases will cost jobs and impede economic growth. Others argue that their hands are tied by pledges not to raise taxes signed as they campaigned for elected offi ce. Critics of President Bill Clinton's economic program warned that raising the top rate would wreck the economy and prevent any defi cit reduction from taking place. In fact, the opposite happened: economic growth was strong and surpassed expectations while large defi cits turned into large surpluses. Th is can happen again. Th is volume is about more than raising revenues and stabilizing our fi scal position. It is about preserving our market-based economy and providing for a strong and eff ective government that promotes not only growth but widespread economic well-being and reduced inequality for all Americans. In the coming debate over our nation's future, this is the narrative we hope p o li cym ak e r s an d th e b r o a d e r p u b li c will c h o o s e t o e m b ra c e , s o th a t w e may succeed in our time as Americans did in Hamilton's time, at the dawn of our national life.

S u b s t a n t i a l reforms and changes in tax rates happen every decade: as policymakers propose new ideas, they tend to match them with new revenues or a revised tax code. Th i s v o l u m e c o n t r i b u t e s t o t h a t v i t a l d i s c u s s i o n w i t h p o l i c y options for raising revenue in effi cient and equitable ways. In this vol ume we presen t a series of policy options, authored by leading tax experts and backed by rigorous analysis, to increase federal revenue in ways that are both effi cient and equitable. Th e policies include better tax enforcement, improved corporate taxation, increased taxation of wealth and inheritances, and taxes on fi nancial and other transactions. Some options represent alternatives to each other; these provide informed choices for policymakers tasked with raising federal revenue. But the proposals share the goal of effi ciently raising more revenue in a way that increases the burden on high earners while largely shielding low earners. Th ere are many reasons to raise more tax revenue. For example, the latest budget forecasts suggest that a persistent gap between federal revenue and federal spending will grow over time and thus generate a persistently increasing debt-to-GDP ratio. a Even policymakers comfortable with current debt levels may wish to phase in additional revenue over time to stabilize or slow the increase in debt. Another reason to raise more tax revenue is the anticipated need for increases in federal spending across a range of programs and investments, including retirement and health care, infrastructure, R&D, innovation, and education. As federal discretionary spending has shrunk relative to the size of the economy in recent decades, investments in a wide range of programs have suff ered. a.

Washington, DC: Congressional Budget Offi ce.IntroductionEmily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 6 New economic challenges may also necessitate more tax revenue. For example, our response to climate change\u2014both through mitigation and adaptation\u2014will require increased spending in some areas. Another example is health care, where several policymakers have called for a greater federal role, which would require additional spending. Th us, even those comfortable with the current fi scal picture may have an interest in raising more revenue to fund new priorities. Finally, putting revenue needs aside, the current tax system could be updated to make it more progressive and effi cient. High levels of wealth and income inequality suggest policy options that would raise revenue in ways that increase the progressivity of the tax code. Th is update might require raising revenue from new sources or in new ways. We also focus on reforms that would both support economic growth and raise revenue with minimal distortions. We begin with a chapter by Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh of Th e Hamilton Project that examines how the federal government currently raises revenue and the eff ects that taxes have on the U.S. economy, as well as the considerations that motivate tax policy design. It documents the low level of federal revenue by both historical and international standards as well as the shift from reliance on corporate and excise taxes to payroll taxes, which are more regressive. Th e chapter also examines the distribution of wealth and income in the United States and implications for progressivity of taxation. Th e fi r s t c h a p t e r o f p o l i c y p r o p o s a l s , b y L i l y B a t c h e l d e r o f N e w Y o r k University, argues for the replacement of existing wealth transfer taxes with a comprehensive inheritance tax. Th e following chapter, written by Greg Leiserson of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, is itself a menu of ambitious options for taxing wealth and capital income. Th e next two chapters fi nd progressive and effi cient opportunities to raise revenue by taxing transactions. Antonio Weiss of the Harvard Kennedy School and Laura Kawano of the University of Michigan propose a new fi nancial transactions tax that would raise signifi cant revenue. William Gale of the Brookings Institution proposes a value-added tax (VAT) that would improve on similar taxes used in many other advanced economies and that, when paired with a uniform rebate to households, can implement the VAT in a progressive way.Introduction 7 Th e following two chapters address the corporate and international tax s y s t e m s . Ki m b e r l y C l a u s i n g o f R e e d C o ll e g e p r o p o s e s s h o rt - run r e f o r m s as well as a comprehensive reform to the taxation of multinationals\u2014sales-based formulary apportionment\u2014that raise revenue while reducing the incentive to move production outside the United States. Jason Furman of the Harvard Kennedy School proposes to reorient corporate tax policy in ways that raise additional revenue and increase economic growth. Th e fi nal chapter, authored by Natasha Sarin of the University of Pennsylvania, Lawrence Summers of Harvard University, and Joe Kupferberg of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, proposes a more robust approach to tax enforcement and compliance, pairing this reform with complementary base-broadening measures. Th ere are of course more options to raise revenue than could be included in a single volume. In particular, we exclude proposals for what are known as Pigouvian taxes (see the next chapter for discussion), which address negative spillovers and aim to discourage particular activities. For example, a tax on carbon could raise revenue while mitigating emissions and slowing climate change. Another progressive revenue-raising option, not included in this volume, is a proposal simply to raise marginal tax rates on high earners. Th is could be done by raising the top marginal rates or by creating a new tax bracket at a higher income level. Because these policies involve less fundamental reforms to tax policy, we do not dedicate a chapter to either of them in this volume. Because it would not be advisable for policymakers to implement all these proposals simultaneously, the volume does not include a comprehensive revenue score. For example, a fi nancial transactions tax may be designed diff erently depending on how a VAT is constructed. New wealth taxes may be less desirable if suffi cient reforms are made to taxing the intergenerational transfer of wealth. However, we do include expected revenue increases for several of the individual proposals, as illustrated in table 1 below; some of these proposals c o u l d b e c o m b i n e d t o g e n e r a t e l a r g e r s u m s o f r e v e n u e . I n a d d i t i o n , t h e proposals provide estimates of their distributional impacts. It is important to remember that any of these proposals would likely be implemented as part of a broader tax package, and it is the impact of the overall package o n p r o g r e s s i v i t y t h a t i s m o s t i m p o r t a n t . I n p a r t i c u l a r , a p r o p o s a l t h a t generates some tax burden for lower earners can be off set by other changes (e.g., increases in refundable credits or reductions in regressive taxes).Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 8 TABLE 1.

Other estimates are based on the author's calculations if they were less suited for TPC modeling. Estimates for Weiss and Kawano; Batchelder are for 2020-30. As illustrated in table 1, the proposals involve substantial sums of revenue. Th e fi nancial transactions tax, targeted at a limited sector of the economy, would raise more than $500 billion over a decade. Although reforms to estate taxation would aff ect a small number of households, they would raise $300 billion to $1.4 trillion over 10 years, depending on their design. Wealth taxes (or accrual taxation of investment income) could raise $ 3 trillion over that same period. A VAT could raise nearly $3 trillion over a decade even with a considerable rebate to ensure that the tax is progressive. Corporate tax reform would also generate trillions of dollars in new revenue. And a package of reforms proposed by Sarin, Summers, and Kupferberg\u2014including measures to boost tax enforcement, broaden the tax base, and improve corporate taxation, among others\u2014could raise a combined $4 trillion. (Th is package overlaps with several of the other chapters, such that revenue projections cannot be added.) Th e scale of these estimates makes clear that there exist policy opportunities to substantially increase both federal revenue and the progressivity and effi ciency of the tax code. Th e proposals in this volume constitute important steps toward the improvement of the U.S. tax system. Federal revenue can be increased substantially at the same time that the progressivity and effi ciency of the tax code are improved. A more growth-friendly tax system that places less of its burden on taxpayers with limited means is a vital part of any project to promote broadly shared economic growth.The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 9 The Economics of Federal Tax Policy Emily Moss, The Hamilton Project Ryan Nunn, The Hamilton Project and the Brookings Institution Jay Shambaugh, The Hamilton Project, the Brookings Institution, and The George Washington University Abstract Th e federal government faces increasing revenue needs driven by the aging of the population and emerging challenges. But the United States collects less revenue than it typically has in the past and less revenue than other governments do today. In addition, how the government raises revenue\u2014not just how much it raises\u2014has critical implications for economic prosperity. Th is chapter provides a framework for assessing tax policies and understanding their implications for growth and economic inequality. Introduction At just above 16 percent of GDP in 2018, federal revenues were below the post-war average (OMB 2019b). Th is low level of revenues is particularly striking given the relatively strong state of the economy\u2014when revenues would typically be above average\u2014and substantially refl ects the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017. Looking forward, the federal government faces increasing revenue needs given the aging of the population and the need to address emerging challenges. But how the government raises revenue\u2014not just how much it raises\u2014has critical implications for economic prosperity. Th e other chapters in this volume provide detailed proposals for how to raise revenue in effi cient and equitable ways. Th is chapter provides important background on the current state of federal taxation in the United States and the considerations that inform tax design. Th e current level of federal revenues is not just low relative to its past values, but also relative to the rest of the world. Th e U.S. government raises less in taxes as a share of the economy than nearly every other advanced country. Th is is not simply due to government doing less in the United States. Th e Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 10 federal government does not raise enough revenue to pay for its current and projected spending, making up the shortfall with substantial borrowing. Th e United States relies heavily on payroll taxes and income taxes and raises far less from corporate taxes or estate taxes. In contrast to many other countries, it also has very little direct federal taxation of consumption. U.S. tax rates have come down over the past half century, with the exception of payroll tax rates. Revenue is reduced further by credits and deductions, oft en known as tax expenditures. Th e way we tax has important implications for economic effi ciency. Taxes may discourage particular activities\u2014employment or saving, for example\u2014thus generating economic distortions. Recognizing this, one challenge for policymakers is to tax in ways that minimize distortions\u2014not discouraging activities that should be taking place (i.e., those activities for which social benefi ts exceed social costs). 1 Effi cient taxation can be an important part of a growth-friendly fi scal framework. Tax design also matters for progressivity and the overall fairness of our economic system. Th e guiding principle of progressive taxation is that those with greater ability to pay should contribute a higher share of their resources. Perhaps the most important justifi cation for progressive taxation is that ability to pay is sharply diff erent across people, such that the welfare cost of a dollar in tax payments is much lower for high-income people. Someone with $1,000,000 of income likely derives a smaller benefi t from the last dollar they spend than someone with $10,000 in income. Also, in practice the poorest of the poor simply have extremely limited resources; policymakers' goal is to increase their resources, not reduce them through taxation. Balancing effi ciency and progressivity\u2014and looking for opportunities to enhance both at the same time\u2014is a core task for tax policymakers. Th e current federal income tax system does impose higher tax rates on those with higher income, though state and local taxes and other non-income taxes oft en fall more heavily on the poor, making the combined system less progressive than it might appear based on income tax rates alone (TPC 2019). Th e high levels of both income and wealth inequality in the United States suggest a need to tilt the tax system in a more progressive direction, while doing so in as growth-friendly a way as possible. Th is chapter reviews the economics of taxation and the facts about how the federal government raises revenue today. It makes clear that the current tax system does not raise enough revenue to cover costs or prevent debt levels from rising. Further, given demographic shift s and new public challenges, the need for revenue (possibly including new revenue sources) The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 11 will grow over time. Th e chapter also makes clear that how we raise that revenue will be crucial. Taxes have important economic eff ects and can cause undesirable distortions. Raising revenue in a growth-friendly way is therefore crucial. Finally , we conclude by discussing the high degree of income and wealth inequality in the United States, which strengthens the case for raising revenue in a progressive manner. Trends in Federal Taxation Despite changed circumstances and policy priorities, the federal government's revenue has stayed in a range of 13-20 percent of potential GDP for the past 75 years. 2 However, the ebbs and fl ows of tax revenue have recently intensifi ed: For example, federal revenue as a share of potential G D P d r o p p e d n e a r l y a q u a r t e r , f r o m 2 0 . 1 t o 1 5 . 2 p e r c e n t , f r o m 2 0 0 0 t o 2003. 3 Current federal revenues are lower than the historical average and have been trending downward as a share of potential GDP since 2015 even as the economy continues to grow. In fi gure 1 we plot both revenue and spending as a share of potential GDP. In 2018 federal revenue stood at 16.3 percent of potential GDP, below its 1950-2018 average of 16.8 percent. Typically, federal revenues have grown FIGURE 1.

Note: Revenue and spending data are from the OMB historical tables summarizing receipts, outlays, and surpluses or de cits. Total federal revenue includes the sum of individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, social insurance and retirement receipts, excise taxes, and other federal receipts. Total federal spending includes interest and transfer payments. Estimates of potential GDP are from the CBO. Potential GDP is the maximum sustainable output that can be produced.0510152025 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010PDG laitnetop fo tnecrePRevenue 2018SpendingEmily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 12 during economic expansions (e.g., the mid-1980s, the late 1990s, and the mid-2000s) and dipped during recessions due to both temporary tax relief and falling incomes. Th e recent decline in tax revenues since 2015 despite a growing economy is unusual. In addition, federal spending was 20.1 percent of potential GDP in 2018, driven higher than its long-run average by the aging of the population and the associated rise in retirement and health-care expenditures (CBO 2019a). Th ough today's federal tax burden is only slightly below historical standards, it is historically low relative to federal spending. In addition, federal defi cits have never been this high when the unemployment rate is this low (indicating a relatively strong economy). Th ough largely outside the scope of this chapter, defi cits and accumulated debt are certainly a core consideration when setting the overall tax burden (Gale 2019). Taxes in the United States are also low relative to other advanced economies. In fi gure 2 we show total tax revenue\u2014including subnational and federal revenue\u2014as a share of GDP for each Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country. Ranging from France at 46.1 percent to Mexico at 16.1 percent, diff erent advanced economies have made diff erent choices about revenues and the size of their respective governments. Th e United States sits squarely on the low end of this distribution at 24.3 percent aft er adding state and local revenue to the 15.7 FIGURE 2.

Th e combined U.S. rate is nearly 10 percentage points below the OECD average of 34.3 percent in 2018. WHERE FEDERAL REVENUE COMES FROM While federal revenue as a share of income has roughly remained in its historical range, the key components of federal revenue have shift ed considerably over time (see fi gure 3). Th e United States has historically relied heavily on personal income taxes (including taxes on labor and investment income), raising between 39.9 and 50.6 percent of its federal revenue from that source. What has changed is that the federal government of 1950 also raised a large share of its revenue from corporate income and excise taxes (26.5 percent and 19.1 percent of revenue, respectively). Over time those sources of revenue have declined in comparison to the payroll taxes that fund Social Security, Medicare, and other social insurance programs. 4 Th is shift away from corporate and excise taxation to payroll taxation (and, to a lesser extent, personal income taxation) had signifi cant implications for the progressivity of the federal tax system, as discussed at the end of this chapter. Given that a substantial portion of payroll taxes phases out as incomes rise, payroll taxes are regressive: Low-income individuals pay a higher share of their income than high-income individuals. FIGURE 3. Sources of U.S. Federal Revenue, 1950-2018 Source: Of ce of Management and Budget (OMB) 2019c; authors' calculations. Note: Data are from the OMB historical tables of federal receipts by source. Social insurance tax includes both the employee and employer portions of payroll taxes, as well as employment insur-ance (e.g. disability), unemployment insurance, and other retirement receipts. Excise tax includes federal funds (e.g. alcohol, tobacco) and trust funds (e.g. transportation, airport/airway). Other federal revenue includes estate and gift taxes, customs duties and fees, and other miscellaneous receipts. 0102030405060708090100 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010eunever latot fo 2018Social insurance taxOther Corporate incometax taxExcise taxEmily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 14 Th e revenue raised from a tax is the product of the taxable base and the average tax rate applied to that base. Figure 3 therefore refl ects changes over time in both components. For example, an increase in the share of p e r s o n al in c o m e t ax e s c o ul d b e dri v e n b y ri s in g r a t e s o r ri s in g p e r s o n al income, both of which would tend to raise the revenue generated by that tax. In addition, higher income inequality can raise revenue if more income is earned by those at the top of the distribution where marginal income tax rates are higher. To help illustrate this distinction between rates and the share of revenue raised, fi gure 4 shows changes over time in the statutory top marginal rates of federal personal income, corporate, and payroll taxation (i.e., the highest tax rate applied to income for a given tax). Perhaps the most striking aspect of fi gure 4 is the dramatic decline in the top marginal tax rate on individual income since the 1960s. 5 In part because this decline occurred at the same time that income inequality rose sharply\u2014exposing more income to the top marginal tax rate\u2014the personal income tax has nonetheless maintained and slightly increased its share of federal revenues. 6 Th e decline in the top income tax rate was not uniform. At times, there have been increases in the top rate, but today it is well below its historical average. By contrast, reductions in the corporate income tax rate have been accompanied by a falling share of federal revenues. Increases in payroll tax FIGURE 4.

THE TAXABLE BASE AND ITS CARVEOUTS Having examined how tax rates have evolved, we now examine the taxable base, focusing on carveouts and exceptions in the personal and corporate income tax bases\u2014referred to as tax expenditures\u2014that constrict the scope of taxation relative to total personal and corporate income. 7 Figure 5 shows the annual value of these tax expenditures in fi scal year 2019.8 Some are relatively familiar\u2014such as the deduction for charitable contributions and the child credit\u2014and others are less so, like the exclusion of net imputed rental income and the capital gains expenditure. 9 Most of the largest expenditures are exclusions from the individual income tax base. Of these, most (e.g., employer contributions for medical insurance) do not require the itemization of a personal income tax return because they are not counted as part of income. But many of the smaller individual tax expenditures (collected in the largest bar in fi gure 5) do require itemization and are consequently unavailable to low- and middle-income taxpayers who claim the standard deduction. One way to think about tax expenditures is in terms of the public subsidy they provide for spending on tax-favored activities. For example, the deduction for charitable giving gives a strong incentive for donations, albeit only for those who itemize the deductions on their tax returns, and at a rate FIGURE 5.

Understanding and evaluating a given tax expenditure is therefore partly a matter of deciding whether a particular good or service merits a public subsidy. I n a d d i t i o n t o e x a m i n i n g t a x e x p e n d i t u r e s o n e b y o n e , i t i s u s e f u l t o examine how tax expenditures as a whole aff ect the tax burdens of diff erent income groups. We explore how expenditures aff ect tax burdens by showing the share of fi lers who itemized their deductions before and aft er the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), which dramatically increased the number of taxpayers who take the standard deduction.

For example, of those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000, 63 percent itemized in 20 1 7 and only an estimated 25 percent itemized in 20 1 8. As described above, this decline has implications for public subsidies\u2014lower-earning taxpayers are no longer given a tax incentive to engage in otherwise tax-preferred activities\u2014and renders the distribution of tax expenditures more unequal than before. Aft er the TCJA, virtually no taxpayers with less than $50,000 in gross income receive incentives to engage in tax-preferred activities, since virtually none of them itemizes their tax returns.

For the same deduction, high-income individuals lowered their taxes by a larger amount due to their higher tax rate. But, aft er the TCJA, itemized deductions are now more exclusively the province of the rich. Th e hundreds of billions of dollars of tax expenditures thus substantially reduce the progressivity of the tax code. THE EXTENT OF TAX EVASION Tax expenditures are not the only means by which tax bases can be eroded. Some individuals and businesses simply evade taxes and refuse to pay the legally required amounts. 10 Tax evasion in the United States is substantial: Th e IRS estimates that $441 billion, or 14.6 percent of the estimated tax due (on average each year between fi scal years 2011 and 2013), was not paid voluntarily in a timely manner; this is referred to as the gross tax gap (IRS 2019b). Figure 7a shows the misreporting rate for various components of individual income taxation, including wages, salaries, and tips; capital gains; partnership, S-Corporation, estate, and trust income; nonfarm proprietor income; and rents and royalties. Rents and royalties and nonfarm proprietor income (and to a lesser extent, capital gains and partnership income) have much higher rates of evasion than wage income (which is typically reported on a Form W-2; see also Krupkin and Looney 2017). Driven in large part by misreporting of business income, individual tax evasion is estimated by the IRS to be the largest component of the overall tax gap as shown in fi gure 7b. I t i s i m p o r t a n t t o n o t e t h a t t h e fi gure describes illegal evasion and not legal avoidance. As discussed in subsequent chapters by Jason Furman (2020) and Kimberly Clausing (2020), there are extensive opportunities for corporations to avoid taxation legally, such that 60 of the top Fortune 500 companies owed no taxes in 2018 (ITEP 2019). Th ere are also many opportunities for individual taxpayers, and especially high earners, to shelter their income from taxation. 11 Of course, tax authorities conduct enforcement activities that aim to boost compliance with the tax law. Th e federal government spends roughly $4.7 billion per year on enforcement (IRS 2019a). An extensive system of information reporting (e.g., reports triggered when organizations make payments) allows the tax authorities to detect some noncompliance and to focus their enforcement eff orts. Audits by the tax authorities are an important part of these eff orts to detect and deter evasion. 12Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 18 FIGURE 7A.

The gross tax gap is the sum of the non ling tax gap, underreporting tax gap, and underpayment tax gap.

Th e cost of the tax system is oft en referred to as deadweight loss or excess burden, defi ned as the cost incurred by society above and beyond the revenues raised by government. (See the appendix for an illustration of deadweight loss and tax incidence.) If revenues could be raised without changing the behavior of fi rms or individuals, the tax system would g e n e r a t e n o e c o n o m i c d i s t o r t i o n s . H o w e v e r , w i t h s o m e e x c e p t i o n s \u2014Pigouvian taxes, discussed in box 1, are an important example\u2014taxes tend t o d i s c o u r a g e s o c i all y b e n e fi cial activities and thereby generate costs for society. Another exception relates to what economists call \"economic rents\" (i.e., unearned profi ts oft en generated by profi ts or preferential government regulation). If supernormal returns\u2014that is, returns above the normal return to capital that prevails in the economy\u2014tend to be associated with economic rents, then taxes on those supernormal returns (see Furman 2020 in this volume) would be less socially costly. In the case of personal income and payroll taxation, individuals subject to a tax on their labor earnings will have an incentive to supply less market labor and to spend more time on untaxed leisure. Individual responses to labor taxation can also take the form of reduced human capital investments, given that the return on those investments is diminished by the tax. Such changes in behavior con tribute to the social cost of taxation ( above and beyond the transfer of income from taxpayers to the government). Minimizing these costs and building an effi cient tax system is an important objective for policymakers. Fairness in taxation is just as important as effi ciency. An oft -used taxonomy of fairness concerns includes horizontal equity, vertical equity, and simplicity. Horizontal equity requires that taxpayers of equal means (or in similar circumstances) face the same tax burden. Th is principle is violated when, for example, consumption of certain goods is taxed more heavily than consumption of other goods, causing individuals with diff erent preferences to make diff erent tax payments, or when tax avoidance and evasion allow s o m e t o e s ca p e taxa ti o n . V e rti cal e q ui ty r e q uir e s th a t th o s e wi th gr e a t e r means make greater contributions. Th is can be understood in terms of the progressivity of a tax: the degree to which those with greater resources pay a higher share of their resources. And simplicity makes it easier for taxpayers to understand how they contribute, allowing participation in discussions about appropriate tax policy.Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 20 BOX 1. Pigouvian Taxes For one specifi c type of tax, discouraging the taxed activity is a feature rather than a bug. A Pigouvian tax is applied to activities that have negative social impacts that are not taken into account b y m a r k e t p a r t i c i p a n t s . I n t h e p r e s e n c e o f s u c h a t a x , m a r k e t participants internalize such costs and adjust their behavior accordingly. For example, if a fi rm does not pay for the pollution it generates, it will generally produce too much of a good that generates pollution. To address this problem, policymakers could regulate the pollution directly, or alternatively could apply a tax equal to the social cost of the pollution. With the latter approach, the fi rm faces the true social cost of its activity and engages in the effi cient amount of pollution abatement. In many ways, Pigouvian taxes are the opposite of typical taxes. Instead of seeking revenue with minimal distortions, the point of Pigouvian taxes is in fact to generate changes in behavior. Th ey can still be used to raise revenue, and oft en are, but the point of such taxation is to align social costs and benefi ts. A notable Pigouvian tax under discussion today is a tax on carbon emissions. Economic activities that generate carbon emissions impose costs on society, but, except in jurisdictions with a suffi ciently high carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, those activities do not bear the true social cost of emitting carbon. 14 So-called sin taxes on activities such as drinking and smoking are similar to Pigouvian taxes in that they tax behaviors that have negative spillovers. However, the more important motivation Here we focus on two concepts for understanding excess burden and fairness: the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) and progressivity, respectively. 13 Th e fi rst is a measure of how much taxable income declines as the tax rate rises and is in some circumstances proportional to the social cost of a tax (Chetty 2009; Feldstein 1999). When an ETI is estimated to be higher for one tax instrument than for an alternative, taxpayers are escaping the tax to a greater extent either through shift s in their economic behavior or other forms of tax avoidance. In turn, a high ETI estimate is an indication that the tax is costlier than the alternative.The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 21 for such taxes may be that they are a source of revenue with an unsympathetic tax base. User fees (such as tolls) are also analogous to Pigouvian taxes in that when any one individual uses a road or a bridge, they generate costs for others in the form of wear and tear and congestion. By pricing the use of infrastructure, the tax or fee can realign social costs and benefi ts. Box fi gure 1 shows the sums of revenue raised at the state and local level from taxes with Pigouvian features. A concern with such taxes is that they oft en fall more heavily on the poor, who spend a higher share of their income on cigarettes or gasoline, making these taxes regressive in structure. Th e regressivity of Pigouvian taxes can be off set with either an increase in the overall progressivity of the tax system or through lump-sum rebates. BOX FIGURE 1.

When those with higher incomes face a higher average tax rate, a tax is progressive. Th e two concepts are sometimes in tension and sometimes in agreement. For example, additional tax enforcement could raise the eff ective tax rate on the highest-income households and corporations while reducing taxable income elasticities\u2014Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 22 which would be both effi cient and equitable (Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz 2012). But raising taxes on high-income taxpayers could increase progressivity at the cost of greater excess burden, depending on their response to the increase. We examine the progressivity of the tax code in the fi nal section of this chapter. HOW TAXPAYERS RESPOND TO TAXES At the most basic level, a tax rate increase tends to further discourage whatever is being taxed. Th is takes the form of a substitution eff ect (which means that untaxed activities such as leisure are now more appealing relative to taxed activities such as supplying labor in the marketplace); and an income eff ect (the tax reduces a person's available resources and may lead them to supply more labor). But the exact extent to which a tax discourages something is important for assessing the desirability of that tax. Th ere are reasons why some taxes should, in theory, be more effi cient than other taxes. A land tax should be especially effi cient because the total stock o f l a n d i s fi xed and landowners cannot (in aggregate) escape the tax. A tax on consumption, such as a value-added tax, distorts the labor-leisure decision but does not aff ect the decision to consume today or tomorrow. By contrast, a tax on income (with no deduction for savings) discourages both labor supply and savings. Taxes on capital income tend to lower the attractiveness of deferring consumption and thereby reduce savings and investment. 15 Another relevant consideration is the salience of a tax. Some taxes are especially visible to payers, like an income tax that they must pay explicitly at the end of the year. 16 Other taxes, especially if they are not incorporated into posted prices, may be less salient and will tend to produce a smaller taxpayer response (Chetty, Looney, and Kroft 2009). 17 Economists have extensively explored the empirical eff ects of diff erent taxes (e.g., Gruber and Saez 2002; and Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz 2012). One of the most important eff ects to estimate is the ETI. As mentioned above, the ETI measures how responsive the tax base is to the tax rate. Th e higher the elasticity, the more dramatically the tax base erodes when the tax rate rises, and the less effi cient the tax is at raising revenue. 18 S o m e t a x e s t e n d t o o ff er few avoidance opportunities and consequently have low ETIs. For example, payroll taxes are generally more diffi cult to avoid than income taxes, which results in diminished responsiveness (relative to the income tax) of the earnings base to the payroll tax rate (Lehmann, Marical, Rioux 2013; Saez, Matsaganis, and Tsakloglou 2012). The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 23 Other taxes (at least as currently designed and enforced) are easier to avoid, especially when set at high rates: Recent studies of the United States have tended to fi nd capital gains ETIs in the range of 0.6 to 0.9, refl ecting the fact that people can avoid the tax by not selling assets (Congressional Research Service 2019). Much of the research on taxpayer responses has focused on the individual income tax, given its large role in the tax system and the many opportunities it off ers for avoiding tax burden. In table 1 we present a range of ETI estimates from diff erent researchers. Th e studies featured here focus on diff erent taxpayer populations, apply diff erent methods, and evaluate diff erent tax reforms; it is therefore unsurprising that estimates vary. But recent studies have produced estimates between 0.3 and 0.9, which are smaller than older estimates but still suggestive of considerable taxpayer responsiveness to changes in income tax rates. However, one should not think of the ETI as being an immutable characteristic of a tax: Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz (2012) note that the ETI is to some extent a policy choice, aff ected by the avoidance opportunities off ered in a given tax policy environment, as well as by the enforcement activities undertaken by the tax authority. For example, if evasion is more harshly punished, the ETI will likely be lower than otherwise. Tax expenditures are another such policy choice. When taxpayers have m a n y o p p o r t u n i t i e s t o s h e l t e r i n c o m e f r o m t a x a t i o n ( e . g . , i n c u r r i n g mortgage debt or delaying realizations of capital gains), a marginal tax rate increase tends to yield less additional revenue. Indeed, individuals' use of tax expenditures may be substantially more responsive to the marginal tax rate than their gross income (Hamilton 2018). Th is downside must be balanced against the social objective of subsidizing the tax-favored activity: for example, a tax expenditure exists for charitable donations because policymakers believe it to be in the public interest for charitable activities to be encouraged. When evaluating a tax expenditure, it is important to ask whether the favored activity is worth subsidizing through the tax code. HOW THE ECONOMY RESPONDS TO TAXES Countries have made widely varying choices about the level of their tax b u r d e n s . A s s h o w n i n fi gure 2, revenue as a share of GDP varies from 16.1 percent in Mexico to 46.1 percent in France in 2018.

On the one hand, tax revenue is necessary to fund valuable public goods: infrastructure, social insurance, national defense, and other public priorities contribute to economic output and social welfare more broadly . On the other hand, taxes impose burdens on individuals and families that can be impediments to economic activity. It is therefore an empirical matter whether a small tax increase from a given level would, in the long run, tend to boost or harm economic activity. Macroeconomic eff ects may also vary over the short and long runs. A defi cit-fi n a n c e d t ax c u t , f o r e x am p l e , s e rv e s a s fi scal stimulus and could increase growth over the short run even if it does not increase it in the long run. 19 Figure 8, reproduced from Romer and Romer (2010), shows that an incrementally larger tax burden tends to reduce GDP. Th e authors estimate that a one-percentage-point increase in tax burden (as a share of GDP) reduces GDP by roughly 3.1 percent (relative to a counterfactual in which taxes were not increased) aft er 2.5 years have elapsed. Th ese eff ects are estimated based on exogenous tax changes (i.e., those not driven by chan gin g eco n o mi c co n di ti o ns o r b y th e des ir e t o fun d n ew g o v e rnm e n t spending).

Similarly, a tax cut that generates reductions in crucial investments would likely be a net negative for economic growth. Every tax reform is diff erent. A reform could start from a position of fi scal strength or weakness, could occur in a strong or weak economy, and could make the tax system more or less effi cient. Th e TCJA of 201 7 made sweeping changes to the U.S. tax system and raised projected defi cits by $1 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years (TPC 2019). Box 2 describes estimates and projections of the 2017 law's eff ects on U.S. GDP. Another way that tax reforms diff er is by how they shift the burden across low- and high-income taxpayers. Th e eff ects shown in box fi gure 2 are for the economy as a whole, but do the macroeconomic impacts diff er when tax burdens are changed for low-income versus high-income people? A recent study examining these diff erences found that tax increases levied on the bottom 90 percent of taxpayers are substantially more harmful to GDP, consumption, labor force participation, and employment growth BOX 2. What Did TCJA Do for Growth? Th e name of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 suggests that part of the stated goal of the act was to reduce taxpayer burden and spur employment to increase economic growth. A number of studies have examined the expected impact, with nearly all studies expecting a short-run boost to growth as taxpayers and fi rms received additional aft er-tax income (enabling greater spending) but a minimal long-run impact for economic growth (Mertens 2018; Page et al. 2017). Over time, many of the individual tax cut provisions expire. In addition, as detailed in Furman' s (2020) and Clausing's (2020) chapters in this volume, although the law cut taxes on corporate income, it did not do so in a way that maximized the increase in economic growth. Balanced against the changes to rates are the eff ects of having larger levels of debt and/or smaller levels of government investment due to the $1.5 trillion to $2.0 trillion of reduced revenues (TPC 2019). Furthermore, even the short-run stimulus impact of the law The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 27 may have been minimized if the Federal Reserve already thought the economy was approaching full employment, in which case a tax cut may have simply caused the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster than it otherwise would have. A s s e e n in b o x fi gure 2, most studies expected the level of GDP to be between 0.6 and 0.8 percent higher on average from 2018-20, implying that the TCJA lift e d a n n u a l g r o w t h b y 0 . 2 t o 0 . 4 percentage points over that period. Aft e r 1 0 y ear s, th o ugh , so m e modelers expect that there will be zero impact on the level of GDP; the Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) expects GDP to be 0.6 percent higher, which implies annual growth impacts of roughly 0.05 percentage points.

The TPC estimate for 2027 is zero. than the same tax increases levied on the top 10 percent (Zidar 2019). For consumption in particular, one possible explanation for the diff erence is that lower-income people are more likely to be liquidity constrained, such that a tax increase forces a sharp cut in consumption (Zidar 2019).

For the top 10 percent, the labor force participation rate fell only about one percentage point. Th e pattern evident in fi gure 9 is consistent with a larger body of evidence demonstrating low and stagnant returns to work for low- and middle-wage workers (Nunn, Parsons, and Shambaugh 2019; Shambaugh et al. 2017). Lower returns to work can make labor force attachment more sensitive to changes in taxes. Figure 9 also refl ects the tendency for lower-wage workers to be more exposed to cyclical fl uctuations in the economy. Hence, a tax increase that reduces fi scal stimulus and slows the economy is more likely to decrease the labor force participation of lower-wage workers (Bernstein 2018). Distributional Impacts of Tax Policies Are taxes distributed fairly? Who bears the burden of the U.S. tax system? And how does that tax system ameliorate (or exacerbate) inequality? INCOME IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED BUT FEDERAL TAXATION IS PROGRESSIVE Th e U.S. federal tax code (including government transfers) is progressive, drawing on a larger share of top earners' income than that of lower earners. Comparing the distributions of pretax and posttax income illustrates this The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 29 FIGURE 10.

As many have noted, the period from 1 980 through the present has seen income become much more concentrated at the top. 21 Th e current income distribution depicted in fi g u r e 1 0 s h o w s t h i s h i g h concentration of income. By the Congressional Budget Offi ce's (CBO) estimate, the top 1 percent of the income distribution has an average annual income (before taxes and transfers) of nearly $1,800,000, as compared to $73,000 for the average of the middle quintile. 22 Th ose numbers are reduced to $1,200,000 and $66,000, respectively, aft er adjusting for taxes and transfers. At the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, taxes and transfers boost average incomes from $21,000 to $35,000. Transfers\u2014including the value of government-subsidized health care\u2014explain why income can be higher aft er taxes for those at the bottom of the distribution. In some cases these transfers are not actually cash income but rather access to resources like food (through SNAP) or healthcare (through Medicaid or CHIP). Th e inclusion of the value of health insurance may boost incomes at the bottom of the distribution by a misleading amount if people do not place as high a value on the insurance as it costs to provide it.Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 30 Th e gaps between pretax and posttax income can also be understood in terms of the average tax rates faced by taxpayers in diff erent parts of the income distribution. Figure 11 shows average eff ective federal tax rates, as opposed to top marginal rates, by percentile of the income distribution. Th e individual income tax is the primary driver of overall progressivity, whereas the corporate income tax, aft er it is assigned to individual taxpayers who ultimately bear its burden, makes a smaller contribution to progressivity, and the payroll tax has a regressive eff ect. For the lowest earners, tax burden consists almost entirely of payroll taxes, which for some households can be off set by refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Th e shift over time away from corporate taxation and towards payroll taxation has reduced the progressivity of the tax code, as have the most recent reductions in corporate tax rates and top marginal rates on individual income.

Average effective federal tax rates are calculated by dividing total federal taxes by total income before transfers and taxes in each income group. Income before taxes and trans-fers refers to market income plus social insurance bene ts. Market income consists of labor income, business income, capital income (including capital gains), income received in retirement for past ser-vices, and other nongovernmental sources of income. Social insurance bene ts include Social Security and disability insurance, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation. Income percentile groups are created based on household income before taxes and transfers. Excise taxes are not included in this gure; thus, the sum of the average effective federal tax rates in this gure (individual income, payroll, and corporate income taxes) are not exactly equal to the effective marginal tax rates. -15-10-50510152025 1st to 20th percentile21st to 40th41st to 60th61st percentileIndividual income tax Payroll tax Corporate income taxThe Economics of Federal Tax Policy 31 eff ective rate of 1.7 percent in 2016.24 Total tax burdens, inclusive of state and local taxes, are less progressive than the federal burden alone: most transfers to low-income households are funded at the federal level and state and local governments oft en rely heavily on sales tax or other taxes that can be regressive. When assessing the distributional impacts of taxes, it is important to be aware that the statutory incidence of tax instruments\u2014the distribution of actual payments made to the government\u2014is sometimes diff erent from economic incidence, which falls on the individuals who ultimately bear the burden of a tax. For example, the Social Security payroll tax is split equally between employers and employees: its statutory incidence is equally shared. But the economic incidence of the tax is believed to be mostly on workers, who experience a decline in their pretax wages when a payroll tax is instituted and eff ectively pay some of the employer share of the payroll tax, in addition to their own share (Fullerton and Metcalf 2002). 25 Changes in wages and other prices can shift the burden of a tax from the individual or business that nominally pays it to a diff erent party.26 WEALTH IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED Despite a certain degree of progressivity in the tax and transfer system, economic prosperity remains very unequally shared. Th is inequality is fully evident in fi gure 12, which draws on family-level microdata from the Survey FIGURE 12. Wealth and Population Shares, by Net Worth Source: Federal Reserve 2016 (Survey of Consumer Finance); authors' calculations. Note: Data are from 2016. \"Share of wealth\" is created by totaling net worth across the sample. \"Net worth\" is de ned as all assets and debts of an individual.

One percent of the population has a net worth of at least $10 million; this group accounts for 39 percent of total net worth held in the United States. Th e U.S. tax system is largely oriented around income rather than wealth, but wealth disparities have increasingly been discussed in conjunction with tax policy (Saez and Zucman 2019). Th ese disparities can serve as motivation for enhanced progressivity in traditional tax instruments, l i k e e s t a t e a n d i n c o m e t ax e s , o r th e y c a n b e a d d r e s s e d d i r e c tl y th r o u g h progressive wealth taxes. 28 Box 3 describes two important drivers of wealth disparities: education and race. BOX 3. Educational and Racial Disparities in the Distribution of Wealth W e a l t h d i s p a r i t i e s a c r o s s g r o u p s r e fl ect accumulated diff erences in aft er-tax income, much of which is the product of racial barriers to economic opportunity (Hardy, Logan, and Parman 2018). Th ough it does not explicitly address racial disparities, tax policy aff ects racial wealth gaps. Th ose gaps are large: White households comprise 90 percent of households in the top 1 percent of the wealth distribution despite constituting only 65 percent of all households. By contrast, Black households represent 15 percent of all households but comprise 20 percent of households in the bottom 60 percent of the wealth distribution (Huang and T aylor 2019). In 2016 the median White household had a net worth 10 times greater than that of the median Black household (Federal Reserve 2016; authors' calculations). Th ese racial gaps persist even aft er adjusting for diff erences in educational attainment. Although college graduates\u2014Black and White\u2014have greater net worth than others, box fi gure 3 underscores that educational diff erences are insuffi cient to account for the racial wealth gap. Th e net worth of White household heads who have completed less than a high school education is 5.5 times greater than that of Black household heads with similar education, The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 33 while the net worth of White household heads with a college degree is 6.2 times greater than that of Black household heads with similar education. As wealth can accumulate over generations, wealth gaps can represent discrimination or unequal opportunities that persist a c r o s s m a n y g e n e r a t i o n s .

Th e receipt of capital gains and dividend income are taxed at top rates of 23.8 percent and 20.0 percent, respectively\u2014well below the 37.0 percent top marginal rate on ordinary income (TPC 2018; 2019). For some, this preferential treatment of capital income is explained by optimal tax theory: Capital income taxation can discourage savings and generate additional economic distortions relative to labor income taxation, though there is little evidence that the reduction in capital gains taxes in 2003 had meaningful impacts on savings, investment, or growth (Yagan 2015). 29Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 34 But the lower rates for capital gains and dividends are sometimes also justifi ed by the realization-based nature of capital income. Th at is, investors do not pay tax until they \"realize\" a capital gain by selling an asset that has risen in value. 30 Higher capital gains tax rates intensify the taxpayer incentive to delay their capital gains realizations, thereby limiting how much tax revenue can be obtained as well as distorting the allocation of assets in capital markets. A taxpayer with a gain can eff ectively continue to generate additional capital income with money that would have been paid to the government if they had instead sold the asset. Even with relatively low tax rates for capital income, taxpayers maintain vast unrealized capital income. Figure 13 shows the distribution of unrealized capital gains by taxpayer net worth. Th e top 1 percent of wealth holders possess on average $4,670,000 of capital gains that they have yet to realize, while those in the 50th to 59th percentile of net worth report only $27,000. Realized capital gains in a typical year averaged roughly $700 billion from 2014 to 2016, or roughly 4 percent of GDP. 31 In general, capital gains t a x a t i o n r e p r e s e n t s l e s s t h a n 1 0 p e r c e n t o f o v e r a l l i n c o m e t a x e s p a i d (Federal Reserve 2016). Combined with the small\u2014and shrinking\u2014share of taxes from corporate income, this means a large share of U.S. taxation falls on work, and not on wealth.FIGURE 13.

Changes in tax policy generally create both winners and losers and are therefore especially controversial. Th e United States remains a relatively lightly taxed economy, and projections are that tax revenue will substantially lag spending for the foreseeable future. Fiscal policy must be evaluated from several perspectives. From a macroeconomic standpoint, the size of a budget defi cit (or surplus) matters for the amount of aggregate demand the government is providing to the economy; a fi scal defi cit can also raise solvency concerns and aff ect fi nancial m a r k e t c o n d i t i o n s m o r e b r o a d l y . F r o m a m i c r o e c o n o m i c s t a n d p o i n t , the details of spending policy are crucial: Government spending on infrastructure, education, health, research, defense, and countless other priorities help determine our economic future. Spending on income transfers, whether to the elderly or the poor, can have substantial impacts on peoples' lives and overall income inequality. How revenue is raised, though, can be just as important. Taxes can discourage some economic activities or, via deductions and credits, can be used to encourage activity. Current tax policy falls heavily on work through payroll taxes and income taxes. Capital income is also taxed, but the corporate tax raises far less revenue as a share of the economy than it used to, and capital gains and estate taxation are a small share of income taxation. Furthermore, while the U.S. tax code is on average progressive, high levels of income and wealth inequality provide strong arguments for raising revenue in a more progressive fashion. Appendix W h e n a n a c t i v i t y i s t a x e d , i t i s d i s c o u r a g e d t o s o m e e x t e n t . A p p e n d i x fi gure 1 characterizes this eff ect and the possible distortions that arise from taxation by showing the impact of an income tax on labor supply. Th e impact of the tax is depicted by the inward shift in the labor supply schedule from the pretax to posttax lines. 32 Workers receive a lower wage net of the tax, and thus the amount of labor workers are willing to supply would be lower at the same wage before the tax was instituted. Th e darker green shaded area directly below that arrow is the deadweight loss. Th is deadweight loss represents the fact that the tax does not simply raise revenue, but also generates a reduction in the taxed activity. Th e more an activity is discouraged, and the larger this shaded area, the larger the Emily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 36 effi ciency cost of a tax. As discussed near the end of this chapter, fi gure 8 also depicts the incidence of a tax, or the allocation of the burden across market participants. In this case, the bulk of the tax falls on workers, but a small portion falls on fi rms who will need to pay more to get a given amount of labor due to the labor supply shift .

As is discussed later, in some cases the govern ment wants to discourage certain activities and can use taxes to curtail them (e.g., smoking or pollution). 2. Potential GDP is a measure of maximum sustainable economic output; it abstracts from business cycle volatility that generates fl uctuations in actual GDP . 3. Th is decline was prompted by major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 as well as a recession in 2001. 4. Th e reduction in corporate tax revenue share is partly attributable to the increase in income fl owing to pass-through businesses (Smith et al. 2019). 5. Note that the top marginal rate and the average tax rate (not shown in fi gure 4) are distinct; over time the fraction of taxpayers (and taxable inco me) exposed to the top marginal rate can vary. 6. Th is is in part due to a shift from corporate income to business pass-through income that increased personal income tax revenue (Smith et al. 2019). 7. Th e payroll tax base is comparatively simple, consisting of personal labor income up to a cap ($132,900 in 2019) for the 12.4 percent Social Security taxes and personal labor income without a cap for the 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. 8. Note that these calculations are static in the sense that, for example, the capital gains expenditure assumes no taxpayer response if the capital gains tax rate were to be raised to that of ordinary income taxation (Kamin 2015). 9. Th e rent that landlords receive is subject to t ax. Similarly, economists think of homeowners as paying (in their capacity as housing users) themselves an imputed rent (in their capacity as housing owners). Th is imputed rent is not subject to tax under current law. Th e capital gains expenditure is the lost revenue associated with the lower rate on capital gains relative to personal income. 10. In the public fi nance literature, the term \"evasion\" re fers to illegal activities, while the term \"avoidance\" refers to legal responses to taxes that may include use of tax expenditures. 11. For example, taxpayers respond substantially to th e estate tax, with larger responses from those who have advance warning of their deaths (Kopczuk 2007, 2013). 12. Slemrod (2019) reviews empirical research on tax evasion and strategies to combat it. He explains that the optimal degree of tax enforcement depends on the costs of these strategies as well as the effi ciency costs and equity concerns raised by tax evasion. See also Sarin and Summers (2019) for an extensive discussion of tax enforcement in the United States. 13. We follow the public fi nance literature in defi ning the ETI as the percent change in taxable income resulting from a 1-percent increase in the net-of-tax rate, which is in turn defi ned as one minus the tax rate. 14. For a detailed discussion of carbon taxes, see Th e Hamilton Project and Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (2019) and Morris (2013). 15. Tax economists have described conditions under which it is socially optimal to set a tax rate of zero on capital income (Chamley 1986 and Judd 1985). However, practical considerations, such as the ease with which labor in come can be misclassifi ed as capital income (Christiansen and Tuomala 2008; Smith et al. 2019) or imperfections in capital markets (Piketty and Saez 2012), among other reasons, justify substantial positive capital income tax rates. See also Conesa, Kitao, and Krueger (2009) for further discussion. 16. Policy choices about implementation of a tax can aff ect its salience. For example, income tax withholding may reduce the salience of the income tax by reducing or eliminating the necessity of making an end-of-year payment (Jones 2012). 17. For reasons of space, we do not discuss other types of response. For example, Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva (2014) suggest a role for bargaining eff ects, whereby low tax rates on income induce high earners to bargain aggressively for additional compensation. 18. Researchers focus on the compensated ETI, which is the taxpayer response to an increased rate when holding taxpayer utility constant. In other words, the compensated ETI abstracts from income eff ects and implicitly assumes that tax reven ues are returned lump sum to taxpayers. 19. Some researchers argue that fi scal contraction, particularly when associated with spending reductions, can be expansionary in some special circumstances (Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi 2018), but the overwhelming bulk of evidence shows that fi scal expansion when the economy is below full employment has positive impacts. See Boushey, Nunn, O'Donnell, and Shambaugh EndnotesEmily Moss, Ryan Nunn, and Jay Shambaugh 38 (2019) for discussion. 20. Posttax income includes transfers like benefi ts from Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Supplemental Security Income. 21. See Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2019) as well as the updated data available at http://gabriel-zucman. eu/usdina/. Th ere is a consensus that the top share of pre-tax/pre-transfer income has increased over time. However, researchers disagree about the precise size of this increase (for example, see Auten and Splinter 2019). 22. It is important to note that this const itutes a snapshot of income and does not capture volatility. Auten, Gee, and Turner (2013) found that more than half of those in the top one percent dropped out of that group aft er fi ve years. 23. Researchers disagree about this number and the ov erall progressivity of the tax code. In particular, there are debates about the very top of the distribution where Saez and Zucman (2019) fi nd a lower tax rate for this group (inclusive of federal, state, and local taxes) than for many other taxpayers. See also Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018) and Auten and Splinter (2019). 24. One important analytical consideration is whether transfers are included in the defi nition of income used to estimate average tax rates. Saez and Zucman (2019) calculate a bottom 50 percent average tax rate of 25 percent (inclusive of all local, st ate, and federal taxes) when excluding the refundable portion of tax credits from the denominator, whereas Auten and Splinter (2019) calculate this rate to be 13 percent when including transfers in the denominator (both calculations are for 2015). 25. However, statutory incidence may aff ect economic incidence to some extent, as was found by Saez, Matsaganis, and Tsakloglou (2012) in a study of a Greek tax reform, and by Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009) in cases where tax salience is limited. 26. Th e corporate income tax produces an even more complicated problem for analysts seeking to understand its incidence. Ultimately, corporate taxation is borne by some combination of workers, consumers, and capital owners. If wages fall in re sponse to an increased corporate income tax, then workers bear some of the total burden. Th e Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC), for example, assumes that in the long run workers bear 20 percent of the burden of the corporate income tax (TPC 2019). 27. Th e Survey of Consumer Finances sample excludes the top earners listed in the Forbes 400, which limits its ability to capture wealth owned by the very wealthiest families. Th e Survey also omits the capitalized value (i.e. wealth) of defi ned benefi t retirement income. However, it has the desirable features of (a) capturing the market value (as opposed to book value) of assets, and (b) not being sensitive to estimated parameters like rates of return, among other advantages (Bricker et al. 2016). Other methodological approaches to wealth estimation like the esta te and capitalization approaches can provide complementary assessments of wealth inequality. 28. See the subsequent chapters in this volume by Lily Batchelder (2020) and Greg Leiserson (2020). 29. Y agan (2015) fi nds that the reduction in the dividend tax generated no new corporate investment or increased employee compensation. 30. Realized capital gains are procyclical, boosting federal revenues during economic booms and reducing revenues during downturns. Th is can make the tax system appear more progressive during booms, when high-income taxpayers re port substantial capital gains income. 31. Capital gains accruing to the bottom 80 percent represent less than 1 percent of that cohort's taxable income, but those accruing to the top 1 percent account for as much as 40 percent of their income (Federal Reserve 2016). 32. Th ere is also an off setting income eff ect. Because the tax makes people poorer, they may want to work more to have a desired amount of income to spend. Th e shift shown in the fi gure is the total eff ect including this off setting infl uence. The Economics of Federal Tax Policy 39 References Alesina, Alberto, Carlo A.

Inherited income is taxed at less than one-seventh the average tax rate on income from work and savings. Th is chapter proposes a major step toward leveling the playing fi eld by requiring wealthy heirs to pay income and payroll taxes on inheritances they receive above a large lifetime exemption. As part of this shift , the proposal would repeal the current estate and gift taxes and would tax accrued gains (beyond a threshold) on transferred assets at the time of transfer. It would also substantially reform the rules governing family-owned businesses, personal residences, and the timing and valuation of transfers through trusts and similar vehicles. Th e Urban- Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates the proposal would raise $340 billion over the next decade if the lifetime exemption were $2.5 million, and $917 billion if it were $1 million, relative to current law. Th e proposal would almost exclusively burden the most affl uent and most privileged heirs in society, while the additional revenues could be used to invest in those who are not as fortunate. As a result, the proposal would soft en inequalities, strengthen mobility, and more equitably allocate taxes on inheritances among heirs. It would also enhance effi ciency and growth by curtailing unproductive tax planning, increasing work among heirs, and reducing distortions to labor markets and capital allocation. Furthermore, the proposal is likely to increase public support for taxing inherited income. While the burdens of estate and inheritance taxes both largely fall on heirs, inheritance taxes are more self-evidently \"silver spoon taxes\" and appear to be more politically resilient as a result.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax Lily L. Batchelder, New York University School of LawLily Batchelder 44 Introduction One of America's founding ideals is as a land of opportunity\u2014a nation where one's fi nancial success depends relatively little on the circumstances of one's birth. To be sure, we have had great failings in this regard. But equality of opportunity has remained a shared goal of liberals and conservatives alike. Despite this founding vision, today the United States has one of the lowest levels of intergenerational economic mobility among high-income countries. While there are many drivers, our tax code plays a key role. Nowhere is this more evident than the taxation of wealth transfers. One child inheriting tens of millions of dollars while another inherits nothing is perhaps the paradigmatic example of unequal opportunities. But under current law recipients of large inheritances can exclude the entire amount they inherit from their tax returns. Meanwhile, those who live solely off their earnings rather than inheritances must pay both income and payroll taxes on everything they earn. Th e estate tax and its cousins\u2014the gift tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax\u2014were meant to partially address this omission. But over time they have withered as Congress has repeatedly raised their exemptions and lowered their rates. In 2020 they are projected to raise $16 billion, implying an average tax rate on inherited income of only 2 percent (appendix table 1, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center [TPC] 2018c; author's calculations). Th is is less than one-seventh the average tax rate on income from work and savings. Broadening economic opportunity will require many changes, but one vital reform is strengthening the taxation of inheritances. Th is chapter proposes raising more revenues from large inheritances and fundamentally changing the way they are taxed. Th ere would no longer be a separate wealth transfer tax system. Instead, taxation of inheritances would be integrated into the income and payroll taxes. A wealthy heir would simply pay income and payroll taxes on their large inheritances, just as a police offi cer or teacher does on their wages. Th e focal point for assigning tax burdens would shift from the amount the donor transfers to the amount heirs receive. Specifi cally, the proposal would require heirs to include any inheritances they receive above a large lifetime exemption as ordinary income on their income tax returns. Th ey would also have to pay payroll taxes (disregarding th e Social Securi ty m axim um earnin g s thr es h o l d ) o n inh e ri tan ces abo v e this threshold, for which they would accumulate Social Security benefi ts up to the maximum benefi t amount.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 45 In addition, the proposal would partially repeal two provisions in the income tax\u2014carryover basis and stepped-up basis\u2014that, respectively, substantially reduce the tax due on accrued gains on gift ed assets and completely eliminate it for bequeathed assets. Instead, such gains would b e t a x e d a t t h e t i m e o f t r a n s f e r t o t h e e x t e n t t h e y a r e e s p e c i a l l y l a r g e . To address concerns about family-owned and -operated businesses and primary residences, the proposal would allow heirs to indefi nitely defer any inheritance tax they owe (with interest) to the extent it could require them to sell such assets. Finally, the proposal would curtail tax avoidance through a suite of reforms to the rules governing the timing and valuation of transfers through trusts and similar vehicles. Th e proposal would raise a large amount of revenue based on estimates by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC). If the lifetime exemption were $2.5 million, it would raise $340 billion over the next decade. If the lifetime exemption were $1 million, it would raise $917 billion, and if it was $500,000, the proposal would raise about $1.4 trillion. Th ese lifetime exemptions would limit the proposal's reach to those receiving exceptionally large inheritances\u2014the top 0.02 percent, 0.08 percent, and 0.18 percent, respectively, when ranked by inheritance size. Moreover, the proposal would probably raise even more because TPC was not able to model several of its revenue-raising features. Th ese funds could be used to invest in Americans who are less privileged, further mitigating unequal opportunities. Th e proposal would take a large step toward leveling the playing fi eld between income from inherited wealth and income from work, while also taxing similar inheritances in a more similar way. In doing so, it would soft en inequalities and strengthen mobility. It would also enhance effi ciency and growth by curtailing unproductive tax planning, increasing work among heirs, and reducing distortions to labor markets and capital allocation. A further benefi t of the proposal is that it would also more equitably allocate taxes on inheritances among heirs. At an aggregate level, the economic burden of revenue-equivalent estate taxes and inheritance taxes is not very diff erent. Both are largely borne by the most affl uent and privileged heirs in society. Th is occurs because both have sharply progressive rate structures, and, on average, heirs of large estates receive large inheritances and are relatively high-income themselves. But this is not always the case: Some heirs of very large estates receive small inheritances and are not that well off . Some heirs of smaller estates have inherited a great deal over time and are very affl uent. As a result, the inheritance tax proposed here would Lily Batchelder 46 allocate tax burdens much more precisely based on heirs' economic status than our current wealth transfer taxes do. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, shift ing to an inheritance tax is l i k e l y t o i n c r e a s e p u b l i c s u p p o r t f o r t a x i n g i n h e r i t e d i n c o m e b e c a u s e i t would better align the public's understanding of wealth transfer taxes with their actual economic eff ects. Experts on both sides of the aisle agree that wealth transfer taxes are largely borne by heirs, and not by their benefactors, regardless of whether they are structured as estate or inheritance taxes (Batchelder and Khitatrakun 2008; Mankiw 2003). But the structure of an estate tax makes it easier for opponents to characterize it as a double tax on frugal, generous entrepreneurs who just want to take care of their families\u2014even though nothing could be farther from the truth. Instead, the estate tax is the only tax that ensures wealthy heirs pay at least some tax on large amounts of inherited income, even if at much lower average rates than apply to income from good, old hard work. Nevertheless, inheritance taxes are more self-evidently \"silver spoon taxes\" and, as a result, appear to be more politically resilient. The Challenge: Why Reform the Taxation of Inheritances? In 2020 Americans are projected to inherit about $765 billion in gift s and bequests (appendix table 1). Th is represents roughly 4 percent of annual household income (appendix table 1, TPC 2018a; author's calculations). Th is estimate excludes wealth transfers to spouses and transfers that support minor children. Beyond this annual fl ow, a large share of existing wealth was derived from inheritances. Inheritances represent about 40 percent of all wealth (Davies and Shorrocks 2000; Piketty and Zucman 2015; Wolff and Gittleman 2014). Th e estate tax and its cousins\u2014the gift tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax\u2014are the only federal taxes that apply directly to inherited income. But those taxes are projected to raise only $16 billion in 2020, implying an eff ective tax rate of 2 percent (appendix table 1; TPC 2018c; author's calculations). Expanding and reforming the taxation of inheritances would improve the fairness and effi ciency of the fi scal system, spur growth, and reduce tax complexity and associated tax planning. FAIRNESS Th e United States faces two related challenges that call for increasing the progressivity of our fi scal system overall, and specifi cally for Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 47 t a x i n g i n h e r i t a n c e s m o r e h e a v i l y : h i g h e c o n o m i c i n e q u a l i t y a n d l o w intergenerational mobility. Among high-income countries, the United States has the second-highest level of income inequality aft er taxes and transfers and the highest level of wealth inequality (Balestra and Tonkin 2018; Batchelder and Kamin 2019; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2019a, 2019b). As a group, the top 1 percent receives more income than the bottom 40 percent and owns more wealth than the bottom 95 percent (Wolff 2017). Both income and wealth inequality are heavily skewed by race (Wolff 2018). Despite our national mythos as a land of opportunity, the United States also has one of the lowest levels of intergenerational economic mobility. Th at is, relative to other countries, fi nancial success in the United States depends heavily on the circumstances of one's birth. On average, a father in the United States passes on roughly one-half of his economic advantage or disadvantage to his son (Corak 2013). 2 Among other high-income countries, the comparable fi gure is typically about one-third, and in several countries it is one-fi ft h. Th ere are even larger mobility barriers among some communities of color. Black men in particular have far less upward mobility and greater downward mobility than others, and to such a large extent that the current black-white income gap is not projected to change at all if these mobility dynamics persist (Chetty et al. 2018). Inheritances exacerbate both these challenges. Among households receiving an inheritance in 2020, those with economic income over $1 million are, on average, expected to inherit $3 million, while those with economic income under $50,000 are expected to inherit only $62,000 (see fi gure 1; for further data, see appendix table 2). 3 Inheritances thus increase within-generation inequality on an absolute basis, conferring much larger benefi ts on high- income families than on low-income families.4 Inheritances also magnify wealth disparities by race. White households are twice as likely as black households to receive an inheritance. Moreover, receipt of an inheritance is associated with a $104,000 increase in median wealth among white families, but only a $4,000 increase among black families (Th ompson and Suarez 2015). Inheritances have even-more-dramatic eff ects on intergenerational mobility, substantially increasing the degree to which a child's economic future is determined by the luck of their birth. Indeed, by some estimates, fi nancial inheritances are a more important predictor of a child's future earnings than are the child's IQ, personality, and education combined (Bowles, Gintis, and Groves 2005).Lily Batchelder 48 Given the degree to which inheritances drive inequality in economic opportunities, one would think tax policy would try to ameliorate their eff ects. But current law does very little in this regard. For example, if a wealthy individual bequeaths assets with $10 million in unrealized gains, neither the donor nor the heir ever has to pay income or payroll tax on that $10 million gain because of a provision called stepped-up basis. In addition, inherited income is excluded from the income and payroll tax bases. Th at is, benefi ciaries of large inheritances are never liable for income or payroll tax on the value of inheritances they receive\u2014regardless of whether the inheritances are attributable to unrealized gains. 5 Some argue that any income or payroll tax previously paid by a wealthy donor on assets they gift or bequeath should count as taxes paid by the heir. But the donor and heir are two separate people. When a wealthy individual pays their personal assistant's wages out of aft er-tax funds, we do not think the assistant has therefore paid tax on their own wages. Likewise, a wealthy heir has not paid tax on their inherited income just because their benefactor paid tax on their income that was used to fund the inheritance. Others argue that only money earned in exchange for goods and services should be subject to income tax. But the income tax does, and should, be levied on all forms of income that increase one's ability to pay, like winning the lottery (which is, aft er all, not so diff erent from inheriting wealth).FIGURE 1.

Importantly, bipartisan experts agree that the heirs of large estates, and not their benefactors, largely bear the burden of wealth transfer taxes (Batchelder and Khitatrakun 2008; Mankiw 2003). 6 As such, those are the only taxes on inherited income. But the exemptions in our current wealth transfer taxes are so large ($23.2 million per couple in 2020) and the base so porous that income in th e f o rm o f inh e ri tan ces is tax ed a t an a v e rag e ra te o f o nl y 2 pe r ce n t, as illustrated in fi gure 2. Th is rate is less than one-seventh of the average tax rate\u2014levied in the form of income and payroll taxes\u2014on income from work and savings. In a fairer system, income from large inheritances would actually be taxed a t a high er ra te than in co m e fro m w o rk. Reci p ien ts o f larg e inh eri tan ces are better off than people who earn the same amount of money by working because heirs incur no opportunity cost: Th ey have not had to give up any leisure or earning opportunities in order to receive their inheritance. All else equal, therefore, fairness demands that heirs pay more taxes on the same amount of income, not less.FIGURE 2. Average Tax Rates on Income from Work and Savings vs. Inherited Income Sources: Appendix table 1; TPC 2018b, 2018c; author's calculations. Note: Estimate for inherited income is for 2020. Estimate for income from work and savings is for 2019. Both estimates include the individual income tax, the employee and employer shares of the payroll tax, and wealth transfer taxes (the estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping transfer taxes). However, inherited income is not currently subject to income and payroll taxes, and income from work and savings is not subject to wealth transfer taxes.024681012141618 Income from work and savings Inherited income)tnecrep( etar xat egarevA15.8 2.1Wealth transfer taxes Income and payroll taxesLily Batchelder 50 But all else is not equal. Recipients of large inheritances also typically benefi t from a huge leg up in life in other ways that mean they can earn relatively more if they choose to work. Wealthy heirs generally have access to the best education, valuable social networks, easy and inexpensive access to credit, and a safety net that protects them if they take risks that do not pan out. Th ese advantages further strengthen the case for taxing inheritances at a higher rate than income from work. Increasing the progressivity of income and payroll taxes could substantially reduce inequality and broaden opportunity. Indeed, cross-country analysis fi nds that within-generation income and wealth inequality are associated w i t h l e s s e c o n o m i c m o b i l i t y a c r o s s g e n e r a t i o n s ( C o r a k 2 0 1 3 ) . Y e t t h i s approach would be insuffi cient without stronger taxes on inheritances specifi cally. More progressive income and payroll taxes cannot ensure that large inheritances are taxed at similar or higher rates than wage income as long as inheritances are excluded from their tax bases. EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH Th e relatively light taxation of income in the form of inheritances compared t o i n c o m e f r o m w o r k a n d s a v i n g s a l s o r e d u c e s t h e e ffi ciency of the tax system and impedes growth. Indeed, several studies estimate that, when one combines effi ciency and fairness concerns, the optimal tax rate on large inheritances is far higher than current law\u2014on the order of 60 to 80 percent (Batchelder 2009; Piketty and Saez 2013a). 7 Th e optimal top tax rate on other forms of income is also much higher than current law (for a review, see Piketty and Saez 2013b). But increasing taxes on large inheritances may nevertheless be more effi cient than comparably progressive increases to income taxes. 8 To understand why, it is important to distinguish the diff erent reasons why people with very large estates might have saved. It is an article of faith among estate tax opponents that wealth transfer taxes harm the economy because they sharply reduce working and saving among very wealthy individuals. But for this harm to occur, the working and saving decisions of wealthy donors m ust be heavily infl uenced by the amount their heirs will receive aft er tax. In fact, a large body of empirical research fi nds this is not the case. Instead, the amount that the affl uent accumulate for wealth transfers is r ela tiv el y unr espo ns iv e t o th e w eal th transf e r tax ra te ( f o r r evi ews, see Batchelder 2009 and Kopczuk 2013). People with very large estates typically have multiple reasons for saving: Th ey might enjoy being wealthy relative to other people, with the prestige and power that it confers while they are alive (egoistic saving). Th ey Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 51 could have saved to meet their projected needs in retirement, including unanticipated health expenses (life-cycle saving). Th ey may have saved to be able to give to their children or others they care about (altruistic saving). And they might have saved to compensate the heir for services, such as taking care of them in old age (exchange-motivated saving). Th e empirical e v i d e n c e t o d a t e s u g g e s t s t h e fi rst two motivations (and especially the fi rst) are so strong among the very wealthy that they reduce their saving v e ry l i t t l e i n r e s p o n s e t o h i g h w e a l t h t r a n s f e r t ax r a t e s ( f o r r e v i e w s , s e e Batchelder 2009, Joulfaian 2019, and Kopczuk 2013). Put diff erently, a lot of the reason why the wealthy save is to be wealthy while they are alive, which wealth transfer taxes do not aff ect. As a result, taxing large wealth transfers generates fewer economic distortions than many other kinds of comparably progressive taxes. Moreover, there are several other effi ciency- and growth-related reasons to tax large inheritances more heavily\u2014and at rates comparable to or higher than tax rates on income from work and savings\u2014that existing estimates of the optimal tax rate do not incorporate. For one, any negative eff ects of wealth transfer taxes on the working and saving decisions of wealthy donors are at least partially off set by their positive eff ects on such decisions for the next generation. Th ere is extensive e v i d e n c e t h a t w e a l t h t r a n s f e r t a x e s i n d u c e h e i r s t o w o r k a n d s a v e m o r e because they do not have as large an inheritance to live off (Brown, Coile, and Weisbenner 2010; Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen 1993). Th is is what economists call an income eff ect. More working and saving by heirs grows the economy. W e a l t h t r a n s f e r t a x e s a l s o t e n d t o i m p r o v e b u s i n e s s p r o d u c t i v i t y a n d therefore economic effi ciency. Several studies have found that businesses run by heirs tend to perform worse because nepotism limits labor market competition for the best manager (e.g., P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez 2006). Furthermore, higher taxes on large inheritances can reduce labor market distortions in much broader ways. In earlier times, we missed out on the talents of many Americans by prohibiting them from pursuing careers in which they would excel, whether by law or intimidation. Today we continue t o miss o u t o n m an y Am e ri can s ' tal e n ts b e ca us e o f typ i call y l ess b l a tan t but still powerful barriers to upward mobility. One reason is the uneven playing fi eld that large inheritances create. In addition, the current tax treatment of accrued gains on gift ed or bequeathed assets distorts capital allocation decisions throughout the economy in a phenomenon called lock-in. Currently, when an asset is Lily Batchelder 52 bequeathed, all income taxes due on the accrued gains on the asset are wiped out because of stepped-up basis. Th is provision creates an enormous incentive for prospective donors to hold on to underperforming assets until death, purely for tax reasons. Assets transferred to charities typically benefi t from the same tax advantage. When assets are gift ed to individuals (i.e., given during a donor's life rather than at their death), the lock-in eff ect is smaller but still substantial. 9 If gains on gift ed or bequeathed assets were taxed more like labor income\u2014which is taxed as soon as it accrues\u2014these distortions to capital allocation decisions would diminish. COMPLEXITY AND TAX PLANNING Th e fi nal drawback of our current approach to taxing large inheritances is its extraordinary complexity and the tax-planning opportunities it creates, which privilege those who can aff ord the best tax advice. Any tax on wealthy individuals will entail a number of complex rules, if only to counter the avoidance strategies that their tax advisers develop. But current law entails far more complexity than is necessary, especially by taxing similar types of transfers at very diff erent eff ective rates. One example of this needless complexity is stepped-up basis for bequests and carryover basis for gift s. As just discussed, these provisions ineffi ciently distort capital allocation, creating incentives to hold on to underperforming assets. But they also generate transactional complexity, meaning incentives for taxpayers to spend time and money on tax planning that they could more productively spend elsewhere. Another example of unnecessary complexity is the diff erential treatment of gift s and bequests more generally. Current wealth transfer taxes generally tax bequests more heavily than they tax gift s m a d e d u r i n g l i f e b e c a u s e the former are taxed on a pretax (tax-inclusive) basis and the latter on an aft er-tax (tax-exclusive) basis. For example, suppose a donor wants to t r a n s f e r $ 1 m i l l i o n a b o v e a n d b e y o n d t h e i r l i f e t i m e e x e m p t i o n . I f t h e y do so through a bequest, the 40 percent estate tax rate will apply to the pretax transfer ( i.e., the full $ 1 million ), leaving their heir with $600,000. But if they do so through a gift , the 40 percent gift tax rate will apply to the posttax transfer, allowing their heir to inherit $714,286 for the same cost to the donor. 10 Th us, comparing apples to apples, the gift tax rate is actually only 29 percent. Cutting against this favorable tax treatment for gift s is stepped-up basis, which results in lower income tax rates on bequests to the extent they include appreciated assets. Th ese cross-cutting incentives create traps for the unwary and incentives for wealthy donors to spend substantial resources on tax planning to minimize their tax liability, which is a deadweight loss to the economy.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 53 Further complicating matters are the rules governing valuations and transfers through trusts or other entities. For example, family limited partnerships (FLPs) are oft e n u s e d t o h o l d a s s e t s i n o r d e r t o o b t a i n nonliquidity discounts. Once the moment for valuing and taxing the transfer has passed, heirs oft en dissolve the FLP so they can sell the underlying assets at will. Th e Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates the valuation discounts for FLPs range from 30 to 65 percent (Dodge 2016; Eller 2005). Th ese valuation discounts are oft en unreasonably large when the FLP owns a closely held business. But they are even more egregious when the FLP holds investment assets with a clear market value, such as portfolio interests in publicly traded stock. As another example, donors oft en use trusts or other devices under which they retain the ability to receive some portion of their property back, in order to defl ate the value of the transferred assets. Grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) are the most common approach. According to one estimate, they have reduced the amount of revenue raised by estate and gift taxes by one-third (Midar 2013). I n s um , w e al th tr an s f e r t ax e s c u r r e n tl y p l a y a c r i ti c al r o l e i n a d dr e s s i n g the undertaxation of inherited income, but they are insuffi cient. Th e entire approach to taxing inheritances\u2014including their income and payroll tax treatment\u2014needs to be reformed in order to level the playing fi eld between income from inherited wealth and income from work. Doing so can soft en inequalities, strengthen mobility, and enhance effi ciency and growth by reducing unproductive tax planning and distortions to labor markets and capital allocation. Before turning to the details of the proposal, some further background on current law is necessary. Background: Overview of Current Law Th ere are currently several components to the taxation of wealth transfers: the estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping transfer tax (collectively referred to as wealth transfer taxes), the basic income tax and payroll tax treatment of gift s and bequests, and the income tax treatment of accrued gains on assets that are gift ed or bequeathed. Th ese elements are summarized in table 1. WEALTH TRANSFER TAXES Th e estate tax was enacted in 1916 and has been part of the law ever since, with the exception of 2010 when it was repealed for one year. As of 2020 the estate tax is applied at a 40 percent rate to the sum of lifetime gift s and b e q u e s t s t r a n s f e r r e d i n e x c e s s o f $ 1 1 . 5 8 m i l l i o n . E ff ectively, this means that a married couple can transfer $23.16 million over their lifetimes to Lily Batchelder 54 their children or other benefi ciaries tax free. Th e $11.58 million per donor exemption is scheduled to fall by half aft er 2025 due to the expiration of some provisions in the 2017 tax bill. Th e gift tax has been a part of the tax code since its enactment in 1932. Gift s are subject to the same unifi ed lifetime exemption as the estate tax, and gift s above that exemption are also subject to a 40 percent rate. However, as previously noted, the eff ective gift tax rate is lower than the estate tax because it applies to posttax, not pretax, gift s . I n a d d i t i o n , e a c h y e a r a donor can completely disregard gift s totaling up to $15,000 to a given heir (eff ectively $30,000 for a married donor couple), meaning these gift s do not count toward the lifetime exemption. All wealth transfer tax exemptions are indexed for infl ation. Th e generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax was enacted in 1986 in response to concern that transfers directly to a donor's grandchildren were taxed only once under the estate and gift taxes, whereas transfers to a donor's grandchildren through their children were taxed twice. 11 Th e GST tax imposes a second (but only a second) layer of tax on transfers to recipients who are two or more generations younger than the donor. Its exemptions and rates mirror those of the estate tax. Under all three wealth transfer taxes, a large portion of gift s and bequests are tax exempt. Transfers to spouses and charities are not taxed. Similarly, amounts paid during life for education and medical expenses and for basic support expenses for minors are tax exempt. Th ere are also special TABLE 1.

Parameters are for 2020.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 55 provisions for transfers of closely held businesses to address concerns that the tax might otherwise force the sale of the business. For example, any tax due on bequests of many closely held businesses can be paid in installments over a period as long as 15 years at a below-market interest rate. Over time the share of federal revenue raised from these wealth transfer taxes has declined precipitously due to Congress raising the lifetime exemptions and lowering the rates. In 1973 wealth transfer taxes accounted for 2.1 percent of federal revenues; in 2020 they are projected to account for only 0.5 percent (Offi ce of Management and Budget [OMB] 2019). Over that same period, the share of estates subject to the estate tax fell from 6.5 percent to a projected 0.1 percent (JCT 2015; TPC 2018c). INCOME AND PAYROLL TAX TREATMENT Although a great deal of attention is typically paid to wealth transfer taxes, and to the estate tax specifi cally, the income and payroll tax treatment of gift s and bequests is equally important. Donors do not receive an income tax deduction for gift s and bequests (other than those to charitable organizations). But recipients of gift s and bequests can exclude amounts they inherit from their income for income or payroll tax purposes. In addition, assets gift ed during life receive a carryover basis, while bequests receive a fair market value basis. Th is means that the tax due on accrued gains on gift ed assets can be deferred until the heir sells the assets, at which point they will pay tax on gains that accrued both before and aft er they received it. Th e tax due on accrued gains on bequeathed assets is forgiven entirely; the heir pays tax only on gains that accrued aft er they inherited the asset. The Proposal MAJOR FEATURES Th e inheritance tax proposed here represents a fundamental shift in the way wealth transfers are taxed. Under the proposal, there would no longer be any separate wealth transfer tax system; the estate, gift , and GST taxes would be repealed. Instead, taxation of inheritances would be integrated into the income and payroll taxes. Th e focal point for taxation would shift from the amount transferred to the amount heirs receive. Th e proposal can be scaled to diff erent revenue targets. Revenue estimates for three diff erent lifetime exemptions are provided below. For purposes of describing the mechanics of the proposal, I will focus on the highest exemption of $2.5 million. At this level, the proposal would raise about the Lily Batchelder 56 same amount of revenue as the 2009 estate and gift taxes if their lifetime exemptions at the time ($3.5 million) were indexed for infl ation. Th e proposal has four major features. First, if a taxpayer inherits more than $2.5 million over the course of their lifetime from any combination of donors, they would be required to pay income and payroll taxes on gift s and bequests they receive above this thresh old. T o state the obvio us, $2.5 millio n is a lot o f mo ney . Less than 1 percent of heirs inherit that much (see appendix table 1). An individual w h o inh e ri t s $ 2. 5 m illi o n a t a g e 2 1 c an li v e o ff their inheritance for the rest of their life without anyone in their household ever working, and their annual household income will still be higher than that of three-quarters of American families. 12 Heirs would include any inheritances above this threshold (taxable inheritances) as ordinary income on their income tax Form 1040. C u r r e n t l y , t h e t o p r a t e o n o r d i n a r y i n c o m e i s 3 7 p e r c e n t , t h o u g h i t i s s c h e d u l e d t o r e v e r t t o 3 9 . 6 p e r c e n t a ft er 2025. Heirs would also have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes (disregarding the Social Security maximum earnings threshold) on their taxable inheritances on their 1040. Th e combined rate for those taxes is 15.3 percent. Heirs would accumulate Social Security benefi t s o n t h e i r S o c i a l S e c u r i t y t a x p a y m e n t s u p t o t h e maximum benefi t amount. Excess payroll tax revenues collected would go to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Taxable inheritances could be spread out over the current year and the previous four years to smooth out income spikes that might trigger higher i n c o m e t a x r a t e s , w h i l e m i n i m i z i n g w o r k d i s i n c e n t i v e s . Th e income tax rate would be calculated without regard to net operating losses in order to limit the ability of heirs to obtain lower income tax rates by artifi cially concentrating business losses in years when they receive inheritances. In addition, each year heirs could entirely disregard $15,000 in gift s and bequests, meaning they would not count toward the $2.5 million lifetime exemption. If a taxpayer received gift s from a given donor over the course of the year that totaled less than $2,000, that donor's gift s would not count toward this additional annual exemption, even if the annual sum of such gift s from multiple donors exceeded $15,000. Th ese annual exemptions would help ensure that the vast majority of gift s and bequests would not have to be reported, thus limiting compliance costs. Th ey would also ensure that individuals would not have to report the receipt of a large number of relatively small gift s from family and friends, for example aft er a wedding. All exemptions and the amount of prior inheritances would be adjusted for infl ation.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 57 Th e existing rules governing what transfers are taxable would remain largely unchanged. Transfers to spouses and charities, as well as gift s for education, medical expenses, and support expenses for minors, would still be tax exempt. 13 Th us, similar to current law, the proposal would not tax a large portion of wealth transfers even aft er accounting for the lifetime exemption. Aside from appreciated assets, which are discussed below, the income tax treatment of donors would remain unaltered. Donors would not receive an income tax deduction for gift s and bequests unless the transfer was to a charitable organization. To understand how the proposal works, imagine an heir receives a bequest of $3 million above the $15,000 annual exemption, and has not received reportable inheritances (i.e., exceeding the annual exemption) in any prior year. Th eir taxable inheritance would be $3,000,000 - $2,500,000 = $500,000. Th ey would have to pay tax on this amount under the same rate structure as their other ordinary income plus the 15.3 percent payroll tax. Because the income tax brackets rise with income, this might mean that part of their taxable inheritance would fall within a higher tax bracket than, for example, their income from work, because they received the inheritance all in one year. To limit this eff ect, they could elect to fi le as if their taxable inheritance was only $100,000 in the current year and in each of the previous four years. If this heir was in the top income tax bracket, their marginal tax rate on their inherited income would be 49.5 percent and their average tax rate on their inheritance would be 8.2 percent. 14 Th e second feature of the proposal would apply constructive realization for income tax purposes to large accrued gains on gift s and bequests, repealing carryover basis and stepped-up basis for large accrued gains in the process. Specifi cally, the proposal would follow President Obama's proposal by maintaining current law for the fi rst $100,000 in accrued gains ($200,000 per couple) plus $250,000 for personal residences ($500,000 per couple) (U.S. Department of the Treasury [Treasury] 2015). 15 Gains above these exemptions would be treated as realized when transferred. Unlike President Obama's proposal, however, this proposal would apply to charitable transfers. Th e income tax due on any constructively realized gains would be paid by the donor or their estate, and therefore would eff ectively be deductible when calculating heirs' taxable inheritances. 16 For example, suppose a donor gives $3 million in publicly traded stock to their child, who has not previously received any reportable inheritances (i.e., exceeding the annual exemption) and who has used up their current-year $15,000 annual exemption with Lily Batchelder 58 an inheritance from a diff erent source. Th e donor's basis in the stock is $2.7 million. Th e donor would have to pay income tax on $200,000 of the $300,000 accrued gains. Th e heir would receive a basis of $2.9 million in the $3 million of stock they inherit, and would owe income and payroll tax on a taxable inheritance of $500,000, as explained above. 17 Th is feature of the proposal would ensure that almost all capital income used to fund large inheritances is taxed once, regardless of how well-advised the donor and their heirs are. It would also substantially reduce incentives for investors to hold on to underperforming assets purely for tax reasons. Th e third feature of the proposal would address the politically sensitive issue of family-owned businesses and primary residences through a special provision. T o be clear, the liquidity issues associated with such assets have been greatly exaggerated in the public debate. Estate tax repeal lobbyists have repeatedly invoked the trope of the estate tax forcing the sale of family farms, even though neither the American Farm Bureau nor Th e New York Times has been able to identify a single instance of this occurring (Graetz and Shapiro 2011; Johnston 2001). More generally, business assets can create liquidity problems only if there are insuffi cient liquid assets in the estate to pay any tax due plus any mortgages and liens outstanding. But this is true for only about 3 percent of estate tax returns, many of which currently elect to defer the estate tax due for up to 15 years at a below-market rate of return (IRS 2014; JCT 2015). 18 Nevertheless, rhetoric may matter more than reality. Some argue that the failure of estate tax supporters to adequately address this issue was a prime reason for the brief repeal of the estate tax in 2010 (Graetz and Shapiro 2011). To address these concerns, the proposal would allow heirs to indefi nitely defer the tax they owe on taxable inheritances to the extent it exceeds the liquid assets they inherit, minus a cushion of $500,000. During the deferral period, they would only have to pay a market rate of interest on the tax due, and not the underlying tax liability itself. Liquid assets would be defi ned as all assets other than family-owned and -operated businesses, and primary residences. To qualify as a family-owned and -operated business, the donor or their relatives must have majority owned and materially participated in the business during the 10-year period prior to the transfer. Th e deferral period would end when the heir or their relatives no longer majority own or materially participate in the business, or to the extent they dispose of their interest in the business, or otherwise cash it out. 19 To qualify as a primary residence, the donor or their relatives must have continually used the house as their primary residence for the 10-year period prior to the transfer. Th e deferral period would end when the heir no longer uses it as their primary Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 59 residence. Current provisions allowing deferral, exemptions, or valuation discounts for certain closely held businesses and personal residences would be repealed. 20 To illustrate how this feature of the proposal would work, suppose an heir who is otherwise in the highest income tax bracket receives a reportable bequest of $12.5 million and has received no prior inheritances. Four-fi ft hs of the bequest ($10 million) is a closely held business, and one-fi ft h ($2.5 million) is liquid assets, such as publicly traded stock. In this case, the heir's total tax liability would be $4.95 million. 21 Because this tax liability exceeds the liquid assets they are inheriting minus the $500,000 cushion, they could elect to defer the excess ($2.95 million) as long as they or their relatives continue to majority own and operate the business. Th is provision would therefore eliminate the possibility that an heir would ever need to sell a family business or primary residence at the time of inheritance in order to pay the associated tax liability. It would also eliminate the possibility that they would ever need to sell such assets over time if they earn at least a market interest rate of return. Unlike current law, however, this provision would limit the preference to those who actually face liquidity constraints and would charge heirs a market interest rate. As a result, it would entail far weaker incentives for donors to shift wealth into closely held businesses and real estate purely for tax reasons. Finally, the fourth feature of the proposal would limit tax avoidance through a number of reforms to the rules governing the timing and valuation of transfers through trusts and other devices, as described in more detail in box 1. Th e proposal would also substantially simplify and narrow the reach of the generation-skipping transfer tax, limiting it to generation-skipping transfers through dynastic trusts, which are increasingly used to provide for an unlimited number of future generations. 22 Th e four major features of the proposal are summarized in table 2.Lily Batchelder 60 TABLE 2.

There would be no maximum earnings threshold for purposes of the payroll tax. REPORTING, WITHHOLDING, AND TRANSITION RULES As with any tax reform, the proposal would require a number of reporting, withholding, and transition rules so that the IRS could eff ectively administer it. Th ese rules are critical because moving from no information reporting to substantial information reporting, on average, increases individual income tax compliance from 37 to 93 percent (IRS 201 6). When coupled with tax withholding, the compliance rate rises to 99 percent (IRS 2016). 23 To facilitate compliance, the proposal would require donors or their estates to report all gift s or bequests above the $15,000 annual reporting exemption to the recipient and to the IRS. Donors would also have to report their basis in all transferred assets to the heir and the IRS. Heirs would have to annually report the amount of any gift s and bequests they receive in excess of the $15,000 annual reporting exemption (and the $2,000 per donor annual exemption) to the IRS so the IRS can track their cumulative reportable inheritances. Donors or their estates would be required to remit a withholding tax on all transfers above the $15,000 annual reporting exemption at the highest income and payroll tax rate (currently 49.5 percent). However, the heir could immediately claim a refund for the withholding tax if they had not yet reached their lifetime exemption, or to the extent that their income and Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 61 payroll tax rate was lower than the withholding rate.24 Box 1 describes how the withholding tax would work in the case of benefi ciaries of trusts and similar devices. Finally, the proposal would not be phased in, but would be eff ective immediately.25 It would apply to all post-eff ective-date inheritances. Previous inheritances would not count toward the lifetime exemption and heirs could not claim a credit for wealth transfer taxes paid on such previous inheritances. Th e proposal would also apply to all post-eff ective- date distributions from trusts, regardless of when the trust was created. Th ese transition rules would be reasonably precise because heirs tend to receive only one substantial inheritance over their lifetime. For example, among heirs who are projected to inherit more than $2.5 million in 2020, their inheritance in that year will represent an estimated 96 percent of their lifetime inheritances (appendix table 1; author's calculations). BOX 1. How would the proposal address concerns about tax avoidance through trusts, business entities, and similar devices? Under current law, taxpayers use a number of strategies to avoid the estate, gift , and generation-skipping transfer taxes. Donors may transfer assets through family-owned entities, such as FLPs and LLCs, in order to claim large nonliquidity discounts.26 For example, a donor might contribute assets to an FLP and then transfer a quarter interest in the FLP to each of their four children. Th e children could then claim that each of their interests are worth less than a quarter of the assets' value because none of them has a controlling interest in the FLP. Such valuation discounts are oft en excessive when the FLP owns one or more closely held businesses. But they are even more egregious when the FLP holds investment assets that have a clear market value and are completely liquid, such a s p o rtf o l i o i n t e r e s t s i n p u b l i c l y tr a d e d s t o c k. Th e IRS estimates that valuation discounts for FLPs range from 30 to 65 percent (Dodge 2016; Eller 2005). Donors also use other entities or devices t o o b t a i n n o n l i q u i d i t y d i s c o u n t s . O v e r a l l , s u c h d i s c o u n t s r a n g e from 15 to 60 percent or higher (JCT 2012).Lily Batchelder 62 Donors may also undervalue wealth transfers by using trusts or similar devices to create string or hybrid transfers, where the donor gift s property to their heirs but retains the possibility of receiving some portion of the property back. GRATs are the most common approach. Under a GRAT, the trust pays the donor a set amount for several years, and then distributes the remaining assets to their heirs. Th e donor is typically allowed to undervalue the taxable gift (and overvalue their retained interest) at the time of transfer because the IRS-prescribed interest rate is unreasonably low. Th en, their retained interest is valued at its actual (and much lower) value when it is later included in their taxable estate. In the process, a large portion of the value of the transferred assets simply disappears for wealth transfer tax purposes. According to one estimate, GRATs have reduced the amount of revenue raised by the estate and gift taxes by one-third (Midar 2013), and they are just one form of this type of tax-planning strategy. 27 Moreover, the am o un t o f disa p p earin g w eal th is m agnifi ed when such retained interests are coupled with valuation discounts, such as those obtained through FLPs. Donors oft en adopt similar strategies when making charitable contributions. Th ey may create trusts that are directed to distribute part of their assets to charities and part to taxable benefi ciaries. By taking advantage of the current rules used to project the share of the trust assets that will go to charities (which typically allow the donor to assume a below-market interest rate), they can undervalue the portion of the transfer that is subject to the estate and gift taxes. In addition, donors can use grantor trusts to reduce the size of taxable gift s. A grantor trust is one over which the donor retains some powers. In practice, these powers can be negligible, making grantor trust status eff ectively elective, even when the creation of the trust is treated as a taxable gift (Ascher 2010). Once a trust is a grantor trust, the donor is responsible for paying income tax on the trust's income; otherwise the trust itself owes the tax. Because the donor paying income tax on the trust's behalf is not treated as a taxable gift , the eff ective gift tax rate on inheritances from grantor trusts is typically substantially lower than it is for non-grantor trusts.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 63 Furthermore, donors may value transferred assets at diff erent amounts in diff erent contexts, oft en without penalty. While legislation passed in 2015 cut down on some of these abuses, opportunities for inconsistent valuations remain. To address these avoidance strategies, the proposal includes a suite of reforms designed to more accurately value wealth transfers, drawing on proposals by the Treasury (1984), Cunningham (2000), Crawford (2011), Caron and Repetti (2014), Dodge (2016), and others. Th ese reforms could generally be adopted on their own or as part of the proposal, but several would be easier to implement in the context of an inheritance tax (Batchelder 2009; Crawford 2016). First, investment assets, such as publicly traded stock, that are held in family-owned entities would no longer be eligible for nonliquidit y discounts. Th e owners of such entities would be treated as pro rata owners of the entity's investment assets. 28 In addition, the proposal would limit the availability of nonliquidity discounts for operating business assets held by family-owned entities. Minority discounts would be disregarded to the extent they were created by spousal property law or through a gift or bequest. Second, retained interests, including those created through string or hybrid transfers, would be taxed under a hard-to-complete rule. 29 Th is means the heir's fi nal tax liability would not be set until the donor's retained interest ends or the donor's death, whichever comes earlier. For example, in a GRAT, the value of the heirs' taxable inheritance would not be based on a rough projection of future events, but rather would be determined once the donor's retained annuity expires. In the meantime, a withholding tax would apply at the highest rate (currently 49.5 percent). Th e hard-to-complete rule and withholding tax would also apply to trusts and other vehicles in which the donor retains no interest themselves if the precise benefi ciaries or the amount they will receive is unclear because no single heir immediately has full and permanent control over the assets. 30 For example, if the trustee is authorized to distribute its assets among the donor's descendants according to their needs, the trust would pay a withholding tax w h e n i t r e c e i v e s a s s e t s a n d , u p o n d i s t r i b u t i o n , t h e b e n e fi ciary could claim a credit for that withholding tax (which would accrue Lily Batchelder 64 interest at a market rate) against their income and payroll tax liability on the inheritance. If the distribution was only of part of the trust's assets, the benefi ciary could claim only their pro rata share of the credit. Th ird, in the case of grantor trusts, income tax payments by the grantor on behalf of the trust would be treated as additional gift s, and would be subject to the withholding tax. 31 Th e grantor trust rules should also be substantially reformed.32 F i n a l l y , b u i l d i n g o n t h e 2 0 1 5 l e g i s l a t i o n , t h e p r o p o s a l w o u l d require donors and heirs to assign basis and value transferred assets consistently in more circumstances. When gains are realized under the new constructive realization rule, heirs would have to adopt the same value for inheritance tax purposes, and vice versa. Th is consistency rule would also apply to charitable contributions and transfers to spouses, unlike current law. Furthermore, donors would have to report to both the IRS and their heirs any valuations of transferred assets procured for insurance, fi nancial reporting, or banking purposes. Th e IRS could use these outside valuations as evidence of undervaluations by taxpayers. Together, these reforms would substantially curtail the ability of taxpayers to temporarily and artifi cially defl ate the value of inheritances at the time the tax liability is assessed, only to subsequently resolve any valuation uncertainties in ways that demonstrate that the tax liability should have been much higher. REVENUE EFFECTS TPC has estimated the revenue eff ects of this proposal relative to current law. TPC based these estimates on their estate tax microsimulation model, which was adapted to estimate the amount that individual heirs inherit and each heir's other income. Th e estimates are rough because of data limitations that require multiple levels of imputation, and because they rely in part on IRS data on the distribution of estates among heirs from 1992, which is the last year the IRS conducted such a study. 33 Th e estimates are restricted to the core features of the proposal and, as a result, probably substantially underestimate the revenue raised by the Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 65 proposal as a whole. Specifi cally, they do not include the proposed reforms to the rules governing closely held businesses, primary residences, and generation-skipping transfers described above, or the reforms to transfers through trusts and similar vehicles described in box 1. Th ey also d o n o t include revenue raised from applying constructive realization to charitable transfers, or from taxing post-eff ective-date distributions from pre- eff ective-date trusts. As summarized in table 3, TPC estimates the proposal would raise $337 billion over the next decade relative to current law if the lifetime exemption were $2.5 million. It would raise even more at lower lifetime exemption levels: $917 billion if the lifetime exemption were $1 million, and $1.393 trillion if it were $500,000. Table 3 also illustrates the extent to which the proposal would raise less if the reforms to stepped-up basis and carryover basis were not included. Th ese lifetime exemptions would limit the proposal's reach to those receiving exceptionally large inheritances\u2014the top 0.02 percent, 0.08 percent, and 0.18 percent, respectively, when ranked by inheritance size (appendix tables 1 and 2; author's calculations). 34 At the $2.5 million exemption level, the proposal would raise about as much in steady state as the 2009 estate and gift taxes (which applied a 45 percent rate to transfers above a lifetime exemption of $3.5 million, or $7 million per couple) if their exemptions were indexed for infl ation and if one disregards the revenue raised from constructive realization. 35 TABLE 3.

F ir s t, b y taxin g l ar g e w eal th tran s f e r s m o r e heavily, it would soft en inequality and broaden opportunity. As illustrated in fi gure 3, the average tax rate on inherited income overall would still be far lower than the average rate on income from work and savings, largely because of the proposal's large lifetime exemptions. But the gap would narrow\u2014and among heirs receiving the very largest inheritances, it would close or reverse. 36 Th e revenue raised could be used to invest in those not fortunate enough to receive a massive inheritance, or the other advantages that typically accompany one\u2014further improving intergenerational mobility. For example, it could fund expanded access to child care, universal preschool, increased Pell Grants, or expansions to the Earned Income Tax Credit to ensure no worker is taxed into poverty. Second, the proposal is likely to increase public support for taxing inherited income because it would better align the public's understanding of wealth transfer taxes with their actual economic eff ects. Experts on both sides of the aisle agree that wealth transfer taxes are largely borne by heirs, not by Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 67 t h e i r b e n e f a c t o r s , r e g a r d l e s s o f w h e t h e r t h e y a r e s t r u c t u r e d a s e s t a t e o r inheritance taxes (Batchelder and Khitatrakun 2008; Mankiw 2003). But the structure of an estate tax makes it easier for opponents to characterize it as a double tax on frugal, generous entrepreneurs who just want to take care of their families\u2014even though nothing could be farther from the truth. Instead, the estate tax is the only tax that ensures wealthy heirs pay at least some tax on large amounts of inherited income, even if at much lower rates than their personal assistants pay on their wages. Nevertheless, this imagery is powerful. Perhaps as a result, inheritance taxes are much more common around the world. Most countries that historically had estate taxes have repealed them, while those with inheritance taxes typically have not (Batchelder 2009). 37 Inheritance taxes are potentially more politically resilient because they make clearer the inequities of low rates on inherited income. Th is should be even truer of the type of inheritance tax proposed here because, unlike most other inheritance taxes, it would include large inheritances directly in the heir's income and payroll tax base. 38 Th ird, the proposal would more equitably allocate wealth transfer taxes among heirs. Th e core reason why is that some small inheritances come from relatively large estates, and some heirs to large fortunes received their inheritances from multiple, smaller estates. In addition, the proposal would apply diff erent rates to heirs based on their total income, unlike the estate and gift taxes. As a result, the distribution of tax burdens among heirs would be somewhat diff erent under the proposal than under our current system, even if both raised the same amount of revenue. In aggregate, the distributional eff e c t s o f r e v e n u e - e q u i v a l e n t i n h e r i t a n c e taxes and estate taxes are not very diff erent. To illustrate, fi gure 4 compares the burdens of an estate tax and inheritance tax by heirs' economic income if both raised the same amount of revenue in 2009. (It assumes a lifetime exemption of $3.5 million under the estate tax and $1.9 million under the inheritance tax.) While the inheritance tax is slightly more progressive, both are highly progressive and the diff erence is relatively small. But if one focuses on the individual level, the diff erence between the two approaches become more pronounced. Figures 5 and 6 continue the comparison of an inheritance tax and an estate tax that raise the same amount of revenue in 2009. Th ey show that, among heirs burdened by at least one tax, only 30 percent (7,972 out of 26,519 heirs) would be b ur d e n e d b y b o th tax sys t e ms. A full 6 3 p e r ce n t o f h e ir s w h o f all un d e r the inheritance tax lifetime exemption\u2014and therefore owe no inheritance tax\u2014nevertheless face estate tax burdens. Lily Batchelder 68 On a dollar-weighted basis, these individual-level diff erences shrink. Th e 7,972 heirs who are burdened by both taxes account for the lion's share (about 90 percent) of revenue raised by each tax (Batchelder 2009; Batchelder and Khitatrakun 2008). But even among this group, individual-level diff erences persist. While on average the estate tax rate rises with the inheritance tax rate among heirs who are burdened by both taxes, many inheritances are subject to a much higher estate tax rate than inheritance tax rate, or vice versa. As a result, fi gure 6 shows that about 30 percent of the dollar-weighted burden of revenue-equivalent estate and inheritance taxes would fall on diff erent heirs. Overall, when weighted by inheritance size, only half of the inheritance tax rate of individual heirs is directly accounted for by factors that determine the heir's estate tax rate, and vice versa (Batchelder 2009). Th ese individual-level diff erences should not be construed as a fundamental criticism of the estate tax, which is overwhelmingly borne by the recipients of large inheritances. Even when the estate tax exemption was $7 million per couple (rather than $23 million, as it is today), less than 4 percent of the revenue came from heirs inheriting less than $1 million. But its burdens are allocated less precisely based on heirs' ability to pay than they would be under the proposal.FIGURE 4.

But the other features of the proposal would also strengthen the fairness of the tax system. Applying constructive realization to large gains on assets that are gift ed or bequeathed would be highly progressive. Under President Obama's similar proposal, the Treasury estimated that the top 1 percent of taxpayers would bear 99 percent of the burden, and the top 0.1 percent would bear 80 percent (Executive Offi ce of the President and U.S. Treasury Department 2015). Part of the reason is that accrued but unrealized gains represent a larger share of the largest estates (Huang and Cho 2017). For example, unrealized gains represent 6 percent of the value of estates under $2 million, but 46 percent of the value of estates over $50 million (Avery, Grodzicki, and Moore 2015). Th e proposed reforms to limit tax avoidance through trusts, business entities, and similar vehicles would be highly progressive as well. Although there is a large degree of uncertainty around how much wealth is currently held in trusts, they likely hold trillions of dollars in assets (Crawford 2019). 39 Many of these trusts were established to exist in perpetuity, potentially benefi tting wealthy heirs in the same family for hundreds of years. Moreover, a large share of the value of such trusts was never subject to income or wealth transfer taxes at all. For example, the donor may have established the trust before the generation-skipping transfer tax was enacted in 1986 and may have taken advantage of stepped-up basis and vehicles like those described in box 1 to avoid almost all income, estate, and gift taxes. Th e proposal would ensure that heirs of dynastic trusts are at least required to pay income and payroll taxes on amounts they inherit. Effi ciency and Eff ects on Growth Th e fact that the proposal would reduce the extent to which inherited income is taxed more lightly than income from work and savings should also improve the effi ciency of the tax system and spur growth, as explained in more detail above. While donors may modestly reduce their saving, the eff ects should be relatively small. At the same time, heirs should respond by increasing their labor force participation and earnings substantially. G r e a t e r e c o n o m i c m o b i l i t y s h o u l d i m p r o v e l a b o r m a r k e t e ffi ciency as a whole. And constructive realization and curtailing avoidance opportunities would reduce distortions to capital allocation decisions, ensuring that more capital went to its most productive use. Th e proposal would shift not only the average tax rate on inherited income closer to the optimum, but also change the form of taxation. Traditionally, Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 71 there are three ways of taxing wealth transfers. One is an estate and gift tax paid by the donor, where the rate and exemption turns on the amount the donor transfers. Th e second is an accessions tax, which taxes the heir and bases their rate and exemption solely on the amount they receive. Th e third is an inclusion tax, which also taxes the heir, but by requiring them to include inherited income in their income tax base. Over time, there have been a variety of proposals to replace the U.S. estate and gift taxes with an accessions or inclusion tax, both of which are inheritance taxes (e.g., Alstott 2007; Andrews 1967; Batchelder 2007, 2009; Becker 2009; Fleischer 2016; Roosevelt 1938; Seligman 1916; Simons 1938). All three approaches have been implemented at some point in the United States and are presently in place in other jurisdictions (Batchelder 2009; Drometer et al. 2018). Th e proposal here is largely an inclusion tax, but it diff ers from existing and proposed inclusion taxes in two ways. First, it includes inheritances not just in the income tax base, but in the payroll tax base as well. And second, it includes a large exemption for inherited income that is separate from other exemptions in the income and payroll tax systems. Th e optimal form of taxes on inheritances depends on the prevalence of the four potential reasons why people with very large estates may have saved, which were described above. In the case of altruistic and exchange-motivated saving, the effi cient approach is to base any exemption on the amount received, not on the amount transferred, and for the tax rate to rise with the heir's income. 40 In the case of life-cycle and egoistic saving, the effi cient tax is essentially confi scatory, akin to a 100 percent accessions or estate tax. As discusse d, th e e m p iri cal evi d e n ce t o da t e fi nds that the vast majority of large wealth transfers stem from egoistic saving and, to a lesser extent, life-cycle saving, implying a high optimal tax rate on inherited income (for reviews, see Batchelder 2009 and Kopczuk 2013). But a meaningful minority stems from altruistic and exchange-motivated saving, implying that the optimal rate should be below 100 percent and should rise with the heir's income. Put together, this implies the optimal form of taxation is an inclusion tax, potentially at higher rates than those applied to other forms of income\u2014similar to the unique form of tax proposed here. Th e effi ciency case for shift ing from an estate and gift tax to an inheritance tax is even stronger when we consider that the nominal payor shift s from the donor to the heir. If all taxpayers were rational and farsighted, this would not matter. A rational donor would respond to any given wealth transfer tax liability in the same way, regardless of whether they, their Lily Batchelder 72 estate, or their heirs nominally pay the tax. But taxpayers are not rational and tend to be infl uenced by salient features of taxes, such as the nominal rate or payor, rather than the actual rate or who bears the economic burden (Chetty, Looney, and Kroft 2009; Eckel Schenk 2011). Because any effi ciency losses from taxing wealth transfers arise from the impact on donors' and not heirs' behavior, this implies that any economic distortions created by taxing wealth transfers will be smaller under an inheritance tax than they are under a comparable estate tax. Simplifi cation and Horizontal Equity Finally, the proposal would simplify the tax system by reducing incentives for taxpayers to spend time and money on tax planning that could more productively be spent elsewhere. It would also strengthen horizontal equity by reducing the extent to which the most aggressive tax planners are rewarded, while those who dutifully follow the letter and spirit of the law are penalized. Unlike current law, gift s and bequests would generally be taxed at the same eff ective rates. Th e inheritance tax would apply to both on a pretax basis, in contrast to current law, which applies a diff erent and lower eff ective rate to gift s. Large accrued gains on gift ed or bequeathed assets would both be taxed at the time of the transfer (aft er a generous lifetime exemption), substantially reducing the diff erences under current law created by carryover basis for gift s and stepped-up basis for bequests. Prior gift s would be indexed for infl ation when calculating whether an heir had met the lifetime exemption, reducing another incentive under current law to transfer wealth earlier in time through gift s. Constructive realization for accrued gains would also reduce the current incentives for donors to carefully consider the tax consequences of selling assets they may gift or bequeath, rather than basing their investment decisions purely on nontax factors. Finally, the proposed reforms to the taxation of transfers through trusts and other devices should dramatically reduce tax planning incentives. By adopting hard-to-complete rules and curtailing noneconomic valuation discounts, the proposal would eliminate the most lucrative and egregious avoidance strategies that the wealthy use today.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 73 Questions and Concerns 1. Would the proposal privilege larger families? One potential concern about the proposal is that, controlling for the total amount transferred, it will impose lower tax burdens on larger families. While true, this is fair because each individual heir will inherit less. Th e economic burden of both current wealth transfer taxes and the proposal largely falls on the recipients of large inheritances, not on their benefactors. If ten siblings each inherit $1 million from their parents, each child is less privileged and has less ability to pay than does a child without siblings who inherits $10 million from their parents. Th us, the children from the large family should collectively pay less on their inherited income than the child who inherits ten times as much. 2. How would the proposal aff ect charitable giving? Th e empirical evidence to date suggests that the amount of charitable giving is highly responsive to wealth transfer tax incentives (Batchelder 2009; Joulfaian 2019). Th e Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) estimates that repealing the estate tax would reduce charitable giving by 16 to 28 percent, while other research and experience from the temporary repeal of the estate tax in 2010 suggests the reduction may be even larger (CBO 2004; Robbins, West, and Boteach 2017). Th us, the eff ect on charitable giving has been an important part of the debate about changes to the estate tax. Th e p r o p o s a l w o u l d s t r e n g t h e n i n c e n t i v e s t o g i v e t o c h a r i t y i n s o m e respects and reduce them in others. Most notably, it would apply a higher top rate to inheritances (49.5 percent) than the estate tax (40 percent). Th is would increase the implicit subsidy for giving to charities instead of taxable heirs by a substantial 24 percent. In other circumstances, though, the proposal reduces incentives to give to charities rather than individual heirs. Currently, once a donor has exceeded the lifetime exemption for wealth transfers, the only way they can straightforwardly avoid paying any estate or gift tax is by transferring funds to their spouse or charity. (Th ey can also, of course, use an array of less-straightforward avoidance strategies, such as those described in box 1.) Under the proposal, there is a third option: Th e donor can make gift s or bequests to a broader array of heirs, such as grandchildren, siblings, or friends, to ensure that all their individual heirs remain below the lifetime inheritance exemption. Which eff ect dominates depends on the relative elasticity of giving to charities versus a wider set of heirs. Unfortunately, there do not appear to be any studies on this issue.Lily Batchelder 74 Other features of the proposal would also create cross-cutting incentives for charitable giving. For example, the proposal would tax contributions to noncharitable nonprofi ts (such as 501(c)(4)s and 501(c)(6)s), which are currently subject to the estate tax but not the gift tax. On the margin, this increases the incentive to give to charitable rather than noncharitable nonprofi ts. On the other hand, the proposal should reduce donors' responsiveness to taxes on wealth transfers in general by shift ing the nominal payor from the donor to the heir. Th is implies donors may also respond less to the large incentive to give to charity under the proposal than they would to the same incentive under an estate and gift tax. Th e likely eff ect of the proposal on charitable contributions of appreciated a s s e t s i s e v e n m o r e c o m p l e x . C u r r e n tl y , th e e ff e c ti v e i n c o m e t ax r a t e o n such appreciation is typically lower for charitable gift s than it is for gift s to individuals, but is the same (i.e., none) for charitable bequests versus bequests to individuals. Th e proposal would apply constructive realization in all four circumstances, but there would be a $100,000 exemption for accrued gains on assets transferred to individuals. As a result, this feature of the proposal should shift the form of charitable contributions during life toward unappreciated assets. If donors are unwilling or unable to engage in such shift ing, it could also reduce charitable contributions on the margin. Th us, overall the proposal simultaneously creates larger and smaller incentives to give to charity relative to current law. Which eff ect dominates for a particular donor depends on how responsive the donor is to charitable giving incentives overall, which tax bracket their current planned heirs would be in, how much they value transferring funds to additional heirs versus charities, how much they value transferring funds to noncharitable organizations versus charities, and how able they are to shift the types of assets they give to charities. In the face of such confl icting incentives and empirical evidence, it is diffi c u l t t o d r a w m e a n i n g f u l c o n c l u s i o n s . A r e a s o n a b l e g u e s s i s t h a t t h e proposal would slightly increase charitable giving overall, while changing the form of such giving toward relatively more contributions of cash and unappreciated property. 3. How would the proposal aff ect the states? Historically, the federal estate tax off ered a dollar-for-dollar credit for state wealth transfer taxes up to a limit, which allowed states to receive part of the revenue from federal wealth transfer taxes without actually imposing any new economic burden on their residents. Although this credit was part of the law for more than 80 years, it was repealed eff e c ti v e i n 2 00 5 an d Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 75 replaced with a deduction. Since then, the number of states with an estate or inheritance tax has plummeted from 50 to 17 (McNichol 2019).41 If one thinks such revenue sharing should be reinstated, it would be easy to do. For example, the proposal could include a credit for state inheritance taxes and each heir's share of state estate taxes. States would likely act to conform their wealth transfer tax systems to the inheritance tax model in order to piggyback on the new federal reporting requirements, as they did under the federal estate tax credit (even when they had an inheritance tax). A further benefi t of the proposal is that it would increase the ability of sta tes to enact o r r etain w eal th transf er tax es if th ey so wish. Shift ing to a federal inheritance tax would facilitate state adoption of inheritance taxes, with their attendant political resiliency advantages described above. Moreover, state inheritance taxes would suff e r f r o m l e s s b a s e e r o s i o n through tax competition. Currently, states may compete to attract wealthy, elderly residents by eliminating or reducing their estate taxes. While such tax competition may increase state income tax revenue, it loses estate tax revenue and, on net, states typically raise less revenue overall (Moretti and Wilson 2019). Under an inheritance tax, states might also compete in this way, but their incentive to do so would be reduced. Each heir would have a smaller tax incentive to move, and heirs may fi nd it more diffi cult to move than donors, who are typically retired, for employment reasons. 4. How would the proposal work in the cross-border context? Th e proposal would apply to all inheritances if either the donor or the heir is a U.S. citizen or resident. Th is is consistent with existing jurisdictional principles governing cross-border transactions, which permit countries to tax income of their citizens and residents, or income sourced to the country. If the heir is a foreign resident, the donor or their estate would be required to collect a withholding tax on the inheritance to the extent it exceeds the annual reporting exemption. Th e heir could claim credit for the withholding tax once they report and pay tax on their inheritance. If the donor is a foreign resident, the heir could claim a foreign tax credit for any foreign wealth transfer tax paid on the inheritance. 5. Does the proposal eliminate the need for a wealth tax or an accrual tax? Recently, there have been several prominent proposals for a wealth tax or an accrual tax. Batchelder and Kamin (2019) summarize the benefi ts and challenges associated with these proposals. T o the extent one believes that, on balance, either regime should be adopted, the proposal off ered here is a complement rather than a substitute for these reforms.Lily Batchelder 76 Th e rationale for a wealth tax or an accrual tax largely stems from our current low eff ective tax rates on capital income and the unfairness these low rates create because the highest-income taxpayers tend to report a very large share of their income in the form of capital income. In contrast, all other taxpayers tend to report the lion's share of their income as labor compensation. Th is inequity is a separate issue from whether and how inheritances should be taxed. One could believe that tax rates on capital income should generally be low and nevertheless support including large inheritances in the heir's income and payroll tax base. An accrual tax has the further benefi t of largely eliminating the lock- in eff ect created by deferral incentives in the tax code. Th e proposal here would eliminate two of those incentives: stepped-up basis for bequests and carryover basis for gift s. But it would not address the third and potentially largest incentive: the realization rule. If one believes that tax rates on capital gains should be raised substantially, it is critical to reduce or eliminate the lock-in eff ect. Otherwise, large increases to the capital gains rate could lose revenue as investors respond by holding on to underperforming assets even longer. Th e constructive realization approach proposed here would raise the revenue-maximizing capital gains rate substantially\u2014by some e s tim a t e s fr o m a b o u t 3 0 t o 5 0 p e r c e n t ( R u b in 2 0 1 9 ) . B u t an a c c ru al t ax , coupled with the constructive realization rule proposed here, would raise the revenue-maximizing capital gains rate far higher. A wealth tax potentially has some political economy advantages over an accrual tax as a way to tax the wealthy more heavily. It is easier to explain and may have a broader base because it would be writing on a blank slate. Enacting the proposal here would not change those dynamics. If anything, it could improve the IRS's ability to administer a wealth tax by establishing a set of valuation rules for assets held in trusts and other entities that better refl ects economic realities. Another rationale for a wealth tax is that it would arguably increase the fairness of the tax system as a whole if wealth provides additional information about well-being beyond the taxpayer's income. Th e proposal here would partially address these concerns because inheritances are one source of wealth. But it would not apply to many other forms of wealth that arguably should be counted in determining taxpayers' relative affl uence, such as assets earned and consumed during life.Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 77 Conclusion Wealth transfer taxes are a vital part of eff orts to mitigate economic disparities, and especially inequality of opportunity . Th e proposal off ered here would diminish the relative advantages enjoyed by those born at the very top, while leaving those who do not receive extraordinarily large inheritances unaff ected. At the same time, the proposal would raise a large amount of revenue that could be used for investments that enhance economic mobility of children from low- and middle-income families. For example, it could fund expanded access to child care, universal preschool, increased Pell G r a n t s , o r e x p a n s i o n s t o t h e E a r n e d I n c o m e T a x C r e d i t t o e n s u r e n o worker is taxed into poverty.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, \"Inherited economic power i s as in c o n s i s t e n t wi th th e i d e al s o f thi s g e n e r a ti o n as inh e ri t e d p o li ti cal power was inconsistent with the ideals of the generation which established our government\" (Roosevelt 1938). Th e same could be said today. Rather than falling near the bottom among high-income countries on this score, we should recommit to a vision of America as a land of opportunity where one's fi nancial success depends relatively little on the circumstances of one's birth. A fi rst step is to start taxing extraordinarily large inheritances the same way we tax good old hard work.Lily Batchelder 78 APPENDIX TABLE 1.

Th is article draws extensively on my prior work on wealth transfer taxes, including Batchelder (2007, 2008, 2009, 2016, 2017) and Batchelder and Khitatrakun (2008). 2. Intergenerational mobility estimates typically lo ok only at the correlation between fathers' and sons' incomes, excluding mothers' and daughters' incomes, because of large changes in labor force participation among women over the past several decades. 3. Economic income is defi ned here as expanded cash income (following the TPC defi nition) plus one-fi ft h of any gift or bequest received in the current ye ar, in order to smooth inherited income over time. Th is distribution of inheritances would appear even more skewed if economic income were defi ned to include heirs' entire inheritance in the year of receipt, which would be more consistent with TPC's defi nition of expanded cash income in other contexts, such as including all accrued gains only when they are realized (Rosenberg 2013). Tax units with negative income are omitted from the three appendix tables. If they are included in the category of economic income under $50,000, that group's estimated average inheritance is $74,000. 4. Th ey do not increase within-generation inequality on a relative basis, however, because of regression to the mean (Batchelder 2009; Wolff 2002). 5. If an heir saves their inheritance, the earnings on those savings will be taxed, but the amount inherited will not. 6. Th e Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) do not include the estate, gift , and generation-skipping transfer ta xes in their distributional analyses. Th e Treasury has only done so intermittently, but in those cas es has distributed the burden to the donor. I have seen no public justifi cation for this assumption and privately have been told it does not refl ect a theoretical or empirical judgment, but rather the practical diffi culty in linking estate and gift tax returns to heirs. For further discussion, see Batchelder (2009) and TPC (2018d, 2019). Experts who question whether wealth transfer taxes largely burden heirs generally assume their enactment is accompanied by changes to income tax rates that perfectly off set their revenue or distributional eff ects (e.g., Hines 2009). But such perfect off sets are impossible if one believes the distributional measure should include inherited income; it wou ld require simultaneously enacting and repealing the same changes to the taxation of inherited income. 7. To the extent that donors with large estates have saved for altruistic reasons and receiving bequests is not a tag for well-being, the optimal tax on in But neither of these assumptions holds in reality. Receiving large inheritances does increase the heir's well-being, and the vast majority of large wealth transfers stem from other saving mo tives, especially egoist ic saving, for which the optimal tax rate is 100 percent (Batchelder 2009; Gale and Slemrod 2001). 8. Th e empirical evidence on this point is far from conclusive. But to provide a rough sense, a review of the literature on the elasticity of taxable inco me with respect to the net-of-tax income tax rate concluded that the best available estimates range from 0.12 to 0.40 (Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz 2012). In contrast, a review of the literature on the el asticity of estates to the net-of-tax estate tax rate concluded, \" All these papers estimate a simila r baseline elasticity of between 0.1 and 0.2\" (Kopczuk 2013, 365). Several caveats are in order. First, these estimates are not strictly apples to apples Lily Batchelder 82 because one is a stock and one is a fl ow, and because the taxable income elasticities include both capital and labor income and are not limited to the top of the income distribution. Th ese elasticities also include avoidance responses in addition to re al behavioral changes. Nevertheless, they suggest that, as a fi rst pass, wealth transfer taxes may be more effi cient than comparably progressive income and wealth taxes. 9. Specifi cally, the accrued gain on the asset at the time of the gift is not taxed until the recipient disposes of the asset due to a provision called carryover basis. 10. In other words, $1 million = $714,286 + $714,286 * 0.4. 11. Technically the GST tax was fi rst enacted in 1976, but that version was retroactively repealed in 1986. 12. For example, $2.5 million would produce an infl ation-adjusted income of about $122,000 to age 98, assuming a 5 percent real rate of return. In 2018 the 70th percentile of household income was $100,000 and the 80th percentile was $130,000 (U.S. Census Bureau 2019). Th is example considers the expected, not guaranteed, consumption potential of such an heir. In order to guarantee income exceeding the 75th percentile in every year, the heir would need to purchase a life annuity, which may entail a lower rate of return. 13. However, transfers to noncharitable nonprofi t organizations (such as 501(c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) organizations) would be taxable at the highest income and payroll tax rates. 14. Th e heir's marginal tax rate on their taxable inhe ritance would be lower than the sum of their marginal income and payroll tax rates because individuals can deduct or exclude half of payroll taxes on their income tax return. Th us, the top marginal tax rate on inheritances would be 0.37 + 0.153 - (0.37 * 0.0765) = 0.4947. Th is heir's average tax rate would be 8.2 percent because this marginal tax rate applies to only one-sixth of their inheritance. 15. It also would maintain current law for transfers of tangible personal property, such as furniture and small family heirlooms, but not collectibles. 16. Th ere are interactions between this proposal and the proposed changes to the rules governing transfers through trusts and similar devices described in box 1. Generally, constructive realization should apply to the donor in the same circumstances as the withholding tax on wealth transfers. In addition, constructive realization should apply to the heir when their fi nal inheritance tax liability is determined. For example, suppose a donor contributes appreciated assets to a GRAT, of which 60 percent is expected to go to the donor and 40 percent to their heir. Th e donor would then pay tax on 40 percent of the accrued gains at the time of the contribution, and the basis in the GRAT's asset would be adjusted accordingly. When the h eir ultimately receives the remaining assets, they would pay tax on any accrued gains above and beyond those constructively realized by the donor, including gains that accrued in the intervening years. A number of complex issues that might otherwise arise would be mitigated or resolved by the facts that constructive realization would apply to transfers to charities, and the rate applicable to gains constructively realized when assets are contributed to a trust would be the donor's, no t the heir's. For further discussion of some of these issues, see American College of Trust and Estate Counsel (ACTEC 2019). 17. Th e heir would receive a carryover basis to the ext ent the accrued gain is exempt from constructive realization because this is a gift . If the transfer instead was a bequest, the heir would receive a stepped-up basis for the exempt portion of the accrued gain (i.e., their basis in the stock would be $3 million). 18. For these purposes, liquid assets include cash, ca sh management accounts, state and local bonds, federal government bonds, publicly traded stock, and life insurance on the life of the decedent that is payable to the estate. It does not include proceeds from insurance on the life of the donor that is payable to the heirs (JCT 2015). 19. Th is would include circumstances in which the busines s sells some of its assets and distributes the proceeds to the heir, or when the heir and/or related parties incur nonrecourse debt secured by the business or its assets. 20. Specifi cally, the proposal would repeal \u00a7 6166, which al lows estates to defer paying the estate tax due on certain closely held businesses for up to 15 ye ars at a below-market interest rate; \u00a7 2032A, which permits valuation discounts for real property used in a trade or business; and \u00a7 2702, which allows donors to undervalue personal residences for gift tax purposes in certain circumstances (JCT 2015; Miller and Maine 2011). Leveling the Playing Field between Inherited Income and Income from Work through an Inheritance Tax 83 21. Th eir taxable inheritance would be $10 million an d their marginal tax rate would be 49.5 percent. 22. Specifi cally, contributions to dynastic trusts would be subject to a withholding tax at the top income and payroll tax rate (currently 49.5 percent). Distributions from such trusts to skip heirs (two more generations younger than the donor) would be taxed at the heir's ordinary income tax rate and the payroll tax rate (disregarding the taxable maximum) to the extent they exceed the heir's lifetime exemption. Skip heirs would not receive a credit for their portion of the withholding tax, which is the GST tax, except to the extent of any unused portion of their own lifetime exemption or that of their parents. If the donor directly transfers assets to a skip heir, rather than though a dynastic trust, the GST tax would not apply. Th e rationale for exempting direct transfers to skip heirs is that it is far less likely in such circumstances that the inte rvening generations had access to the assets the skip heir inherits and chose to forgo such access. 23. Comparable estimates for the estate and gift tax are not available. 24. Th e withholding tax would apply to the tax-inclusive gift or bequest, as would the heir's income and payroll tax liability. For example, suppose a donor wants to transfer $1 million aft er tax to their heir. Th ey would need to set aside $1,980,198 for the transfer and would remit a withholding tax of 49.5 percent, or $980,198, on that amount, with the remaining $1 million going to the heir. Th e heir would report an inheritance of $1,980,198 on their Fo rm 1040. If the heir had already used up their annual and lifetime exemptions and was in the highest tax bracket, they would owe no additional tax and would receive no refund. However, if thes e conditions did not hold, the heir would receive a credit for the excess withholding tax paid. 25. Th e eff ective date should be a date earlier than th e date of enactment, such as the date of introduction, in order to limit tax planning in anticipation of the reform. Th is is a common practice in tax legislation. 26. Th ese include discounts for lack-of-marketability, lack-of-control, and minority interests (Cunningham and Cunningham 2018). 27. Another example is an installment sale by a dono r to their grantor trust, which the trust pays for with an installment note bearing a low rate of interest (U.S. Senate Committee on Finance 2017). 28. Th is treatment would apply even if state law or the governing documents limit the heir's ability to sell, redeem, or liquidate their interest. 29. Following Dodge (2016), retained interests would be defi ned broadly to include the possibility of the donor receiving trust income or assets un der another person's power, even if that power is limited by standards such as support. 30. Th is treatment would apply to charitable lead an nuity trusts, irrevocable life insurance trusts, insurance dedicated funds, and Crummey trusts, just to name a few examples. 31. Th is treatment should apply to income tax payments by the donor aft er the eff ective date, whether on behalf of new or existing grantor trusts. 32. For proposals, see Schmolka (2000), Soled (2001), Ascher (2010), and Cunningham and Cunningham (2012). If the grantor trust rules were largely repealed, this proposal would be less necessary. 33. Th e IRS has conducted more limited studies since then and, controlling for estate size, the distribution of estates among heirs does not appe ar to have changed in any dramatic ways (Joulfaian 2019). 34. If one excludes households that do not receive an inheritance in the curren t year, the corresponding percentages are 0.8 percent, 3.6 percent, and 7.7 percent. Arguably, the best approach would be to rank households by lifetime inheritances re ceived and include those that never receive an inheritance. In this case, the share of households burdened by the proposal would also be very small because only a small minority ever receive an inheritance (Th ompson and Suarez 2015). 35. Specifi cally, TPC estimates the estate and gift taxes at the 2009 parameters (indexed) would raise $518 billion over calendar years 2020 to 2029, relative to a baseline of no wealth transfer taxes. Th e estate and gift tax lifetime exemption in 2020 would be $4.14 million aft er indexing ($8.28 million per couple). Disregarding constructive realizatio n, TPC estimates the proposed inheritance tax would raise $511 billion over the same period in steady state relative to a baseline of no wealth transfer taxes. While TPC assumes the proposal is eff ective immediately (i.e., that it applies to gift s and bequests received aft er December 31, 2019), some of the revenue raised from transfers in 2028 to 2030 would not be collected until aft er 2030, and thus are not included in table 3.

Heirs with inheritances far above the lifetime exemption could pay a higher average tax rate on their inherited income than their income from wo rk because the Social Security tax applies only to labor earnings up to $137,700 in 2020. However, this would not be the case for heirs who are not far above the lifetime exemption because it wo uld substantially lower their average tax rate on inherited income. 37. Th e U.S. states also have been less likely to repeal inheritance taxes than estate taxes (Cammenga 2019; McNichol 2019). 38. Most inheritance taxes in the U.S. states and ar ound the world are accessions taxes, which provide an exemption for each heir and then apply a fl at, low rate above that exemption that is unrelated to the heir's income or payroll tax rate (Batchelder 2009). 39. Banks and trust companies acting as trustees must report the amount of trust assets they manage, which was $918 billion in 2018 (Sitkoff and Dukeminier 2017). But when a private individual serves as the trustee, there is no similar reporting req uirement. Moreover, many trust assets, including real estate and closely held bu siness interests, cannot be held in a tr ust maintained by a bank or trust company (Crawford 2019). 40. As explained in Batchelder (2009), because exchange-motivated transfers are essentially compensation, they should be taxed like all ot her labor income and included in the income and payroll tax bases. Altruistic transfers should be subsidized to account for positive externalities, with the subsidy rate gradually declining to zero as the heir's ability to pay rises. 41.

Taxing Wealth 89 Abstract Th e U.S. income tax does a poor job of taxing the income from wealth. Th is chapter details four approaches to reforming the taxation of wealth, each of which is calibrated to raise approximately $3 trillion over the next decade. Approach 1 is a 2 percent annual wealth tax above $25 million ($12.5 million for individual fi lers). Approach 2 is a 2 percent annual wealth tax with realization-based taxation of non-traded assets for taxpayers with more than $25 million ($12.5 million for individual fi lers). Approach 3 is accrual taxation of investment income at ordinary tax rates for taxpayers with more than $16.5 million in gross assets ($8.25 million for individual fi lers). And Approach 4 is accrual taxation at ordinary tax rates with realization-based taxation of non-traded assets for those with more than $16.5 million in gross assets ($8.25 million for individual fi lers). Under both the realization-based wealth tax and the realization-based accrual tax, the tax paid upon realization would be computed in a manner designed to eliminate the benefi ts of deferral. As a result, all four approaches would address the fundamental weakness of the existing income tax when it comes to taxing investment income: allowing taxpayers to defer paying tax on investment gains until assets are sold at no cost. Introduction In fi scal year 2019 the federal government collected revenues equal to 1 6 .3 p e r c e n t o f G D P , w e ll b e l o w th e 1 7 . 4 p e r c e n t a v e r a g e o f th e p ri o r 5 0 years (Congressional Budget Offi ce [CBO] 2019b). In light of both existing spending commitments and the potential benefi ts of additional spending in a variety of areas, the federal government should raise additional revenues. High and rising inequality strongly suggests that the wealthy should contribute a substantial share of these revenues (Auten and Splinter 2019; Taxing Wealth Greg Leiserson, Washington Center for Equitable GrowthGreg Leiserson 90 and Zwick 2019). Moreover, structural weaknesses in how the income tax applies to the income from wealth\u2014weaknesses that facilitate tax avoidance and generate inequities\u2014point to the taxation of wealth as an area ripe for reform. Under current law, gains on investment assets are taxed only when realized, generally meaning when an asset is sold. About 20 percent of the income of the top 1 percent consists of realized capital gains (CBO 2019a). However, measuring capital gains only when they are realized understates both total incomes and the portion attributable to capital gains. Unrealized gains, meaning increases in the value of investment assets that have not been sold, represent a substantial fraction of all gains and have grown in importance in recent decades (Robbins 2018). Importantly, unrealized gains on assets that are never sold during a taxpayer's lifetime are wiped out for income tax purposes at death under a provision known as step-up in basis. (See appendix A for a description of the taxation of wealth and investment income under current law.) Th e opportunity to defer taxation until assets are sold and to avoid taxes entirely if assets are never sold leads to widespread, and costly, tax avoidance. Moreover, even when gains are taxed, they are taxed at preferential rates. Th e maximum federal income tax rate on capital gains and dividends is only 23.8 percent, whereas the maximum rate on ordinary income is 40.8 percent. 1 Reforming the taxation of wealth\u2014by strengthening the tax base and simultaneously increasing tax rates\u2014off ers an important opportunity to raise substantial revenues from the wealthiest families. Th is chapter details four alternative approaches to reforming the taxation of wealth: 1. A 2 percent annual wealth tax on the market value of a family's wealth in excess of $25 million for married couples and $12.5 million for individuals. 2. A 2 percent annual wealth tax on the market value of a family's publicly traded assets and liabilities, combined with an equivalent retrospective t a x o n n o n - t r a d e d a s s e t s w h e n t h e y a r e s o l d , a p p l i c a b l e t o f a m i l y wealth in excess of $25 million for married couples and $12.5 million for individuals. 3. Accrual taxation of investment income at ordinary tax rates for married taxpayers with more than $16.5 million in gross assets and single taxpayers with more than $8.25 million in gross assets, meaning that Taxing Wealth 91 aff ected taxpayers would include all investment gains in income in the year in which the gains accrue through mark-to-market accounting. 4 . A c c r u a l t a x a t i o n o f i n v e s t m e n t i n c o m e f r o m p u b l i c l y t r a d e d a s s e t s and liabilities at ordinary tax rates, combined with an equivalent retrospective tax on income from non-traded assets when they are sold, applicable to married taxpayers with more than $16.5 million in gross assets and individual taxpayers with more than $8.25 million in gross assets . Under Approaches 2 and 4, both of which tax gains on non-traded assets upon realization, the tax paid would be computed in a manner designed to eliminate the benefi ts of deferral, through what is known as a deferral charge. To simplify terminology, I refer to these approaches as realization-based approaches throughout this chapter, even though they rely on realization only for non-traded assets and not for publicly traded assets. Th e four approaches share many common features, both as a matter of implementation and as a matter of economics. Th ey diff er in structure on two main dimensions: whether they tax the stock of wealth or the fl ow of income from wealth, and whether they are based on annual asset valuations or rely on realization for assets that are not publicly traded (see fi gure 1). Th e wealth tax approaches apply to the stock of wealth, whereas the accrual taxation approaches apply to the fl ow of income from wealth. Th e wealth tax and the accrual tax rely on annual valuations for all assets and liabilities, while the two realization-based approaches rely on realization to measure the value of non-traded assets. FIGURE 1. Four Approaches to Taxing Wealth Tax on wealth Tax on income from wealth Valuation-based taxation of non-traded assetsWealth tax (Approach 1)Accrual taxation (Approach 3) Realization-based taxation of non-traded assetsRealization-based wealth tax (Approach 2)Realization-based accrual taxation (Approach 4)Greg Leiserson 92 As a result of these structural diff erences, the approaches diff er in their treatment of uncertain investment returns, their treatment of assets that deliver nonfi nancial returns, the scope for and ease of integration with the existing income tax, progressivity, and the risk that the proposals would be declared unconstitutional. All four approaches would avoid the structural shortcomings of the current income tax, delivering larger revenue increases for a given increase in burden than would be possible with a simple increase in the tax rate on capital gains. Th e wealth tax and accrual tax approaches (Approaches 1 and 3, respectively) are each calibrated to raise $3 trillion between 2021 and 2030, ignoring transitional revenues under the accrual tax. Th e burden of both approaches would lie overwhelmingly on the wealthiest households. Essentially all of the burden of the wealth tax (Approach 1) would lie on the wealthiest 1 percent of households in 2021, and 98 percent of the burden of the accrual tax (Approach 3) would lie on the wealthiest 1 percent of households. 2 However, the wealth tax would be more heavily concentrated on the very wealthiest households than would the accrual tax. Th e accrual tax would also aff ect more households (0.8 percent of all households) than the wealth tax (0.5 percent). Both approaches would substantially reduce the aft er-tax incomes of the top 1 percent of households when classifi ed by wealth, with aft er-tax incomes falling by 15 percent in 2021 under the wealth tax and 12 percent under the accrual tax. Separate estimates of the revenues raised and burden imposed by the realization-based approaches are not presented in this chapter due to the limited evidence on which to base an estimate of the diff erences between the valuation-based approaches (Approaches 1 and 3) and the realization-based approaches (Approaches 2 and 4). However, these diff erences are critical in assessing their relative merits, so I provide substantial discussion of these diff erences below. As presented in this chapter, taxing wealth\u2014whether through a wealth tax or accrual taxation of investment income\u2014serves to complete the income tax. Th is motivation for taxing wealth is not new with this proposal. Schenk (2000) proposes adopting a wealth tax alongside a consumption tax, which she brands as a proposal to save the income tax. And accrual taxation is part of the Haig-Simons income tax base that has long been considered the benchmark for a comprehensive income tax, defi ned as consumption plus the change in net worth (Simons 1938). 3 Th e chapter proceeds as follows. Th e fi rst section describes the shortcomings of the current system and explains why fundamental reform is needed. Th e next section lays out the four approaches to taxing wealth in detail. Th e Taxing Wealth 93 following section reviews the economic eff ects of taxing wealth. Th e fourth section addresses questions and concerns about taxing wealth. A fi nal section concludes. The Challenge As noted in the introduction, income from wealth accounts for a substantial share of all income for the wealthiest households, but the existing income tax does a poor job of taxing this income. Th e root cause of this problem is that the tax code allows taxpayers to defer (without interest) paying tax on investment gains until assets are sold. Realization-based taxation of capital gains without an appropriate deferral charge opens the door to substantial and costly tax avoidance, reducing revenues and generating inequities across taxpayers. On its own, deferral\u2014the opportunity to delay paying tax until an asset is sold\u2014mechanically reduces the present value of tax due on an investment (i.e., the value of the tax that will be due over the life of the asset today, aft er adjusting for the time value of money) because the tax liability does not compound over time. In other words, a taxpayer who must pay tax on asset returns every year accumulates wealth more slowly than a taxpayer who pays tax only once aft er holding an asset for several years. Symmetrically, just as taxpayers benefi t from deferring gains, they also benefi t from accelerating losses. And, since taxpayers can choose when to realize gains and losses, they will tend to accelerate the sale of assets that have decreased in value. Th e incentive to defer tax is much larger than just the time value of money, h o w e v e r , b e c a u s e d e f e r r al c an b e c o m b i n e d wi th o th e r p r o vi s i o n s o f t ax law to yield additional benefi ts. Taxpayers may hope to avoid selling an asset until their death, and thus hope to avoid paying any capital gains tax whatsoever. In the case of real estate assets, they may plan to swap one asset for another in a like-kind exchange that allows them to defer tax. 4 And, although like-kind exchanges off er only a temporary deferral of tax, they make it easier to avoid selling assets during a taxpayer's life and thus also facilitate the use of the step-up in basis at death to avoid tax entirely. Taxpayers may allow assets to appreciate and then donate the appreciated asset to charity, in which case they pay no tax on the capital gain but receive a charitable deduction equal to the market value including the gain. Finally, but importantly, taxpayers may choose to delay selling an appreciated asset because they expect Congress to reduce tax rates in the future; thus, by holding on to an asset they expect to ultimately pay tax at a lower rate.Greg Leiserson 94 All of these actions to avoid tax through deferral come at a cost. Taxpayers incur costs for professional services as they structure their transactions to avoid buying or selling assets. Taxpayers incur costs when they skew their portfolio away from what would otherwise be their preferred investments to assets that can benefi t from deferral more readily, such as shift ing their portfolio from debt to equity. And taxpayers incur costs when they hold on to positions that are no longer desirable from a pretax perspective because selling their position would require them to pay taxes. I am unaware of a direct estimate of these costs in the aggregate, but there is substantial indirect evidence that these costs are an important consideration in individuals' tax planning and thus for policymakers when setting tax policy. For example, researchers have documented that taxpayers adjust the timing of their transactions to benefi t from the diff erence in the tax rate on short-term and long-term gains. Th ese responses are indicative of taxpayers' willingness and ability to avoid taxes by changing the timing of capital gains realizations, and suggestive of the costs associated with changing the timing. Dowd, McClelland, and Mortenson (2019), for example, fi nd pronounced spikes in the quantity of capital gains realized just over the eligibility threshold for the lower long-term capital gains rate (fi gure 2). FIGURE 2. Capital Gains Realizations by Holding Period Source: Dowd, McClelland, and Mortenson 2019.

(See fi gure 3 for the trend in long-term capital gains realizations over time). As noted above, realization-based taxation of capital gains can aff ect not just decisions about when to sell assets, but also the choice of which assets t o h o l d in th e fi rst place. Poterba and Samwick (2003), for example, fi nd evidence consistent with higher tax rates encouraging a shift into assets that are more lightly taxed, such as retirement holdings, tax-exempt bonds, and equities. Although the evidence of behavioral responses to capital gains taxes indicates the existence of costly avoidance, deferral also generates inequities across taxpayers with diff erent capacities to exploit deferral. Wealthy t axp a y e r s wi th a c c e s s t o fi nancial markets can maximize the benefi ts of deferral on their investments including through the step-up in basis at death, but middle-class families who draw down their assets in retirement are unable to benefi t from the provisions to the same extent. Finally, the preferential rates for capital gains and dividends are both expensive and regressive. Th e U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) estimates that the tax expenditure for the preferential rates on capital gains will total $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2029, and the tax expenditure for the preferential rates on dividends will be $400 billion over the same period (Treasury 2019). Th e tax expenditure for stepped-up basis is an additional $700 billion over 10 years. Th e Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC) FIGURE 3.

Th ese rate disparities also encourage taxpayers to attempt to convert income taxed at ordinary rates into income that can benefi t from preferential rates. THE NEED FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORM Incremental reform proposals could address some of the issues identifi ed above and would be well worth pursuing in the absence of fundamental reform. However, these proposals do not substitute for fundamental reforms to the taxation of wealth. Indeed, incremental proposals to address these issues are oft en included\u2014implicitly or explicitly\u2014in fundamental reforms. One major incremental reform would be to treat death or gift as a realization event for purposes of the income tax. In other words, all unrealized gains would be taxed when a person dies or gives away the underlying asset. Th e Obama administration included a proposal along these lines in the President's budget each year beginning in 2015 (Treasury 2015a). As noted above, the tax expenditure for the step-up in basis at death is projected to be $700 billion over the next decade. 5FIGURE 4.

Note: Estimates are 2018.012345678910 Lowest 0.1 percentAll 90-95th percentTaxing Wealth 97 A second incremental reform would be to raise the tax rate on dividends. T r a d i t i o n a l l y , d i v i d e n d p a y m e n t s h a v e b e e n v i e w e d a s l e s s s e n s i t i v e t o taxation than capital gains realizations and potentially less relevant in determining the equilibrium cost of capital (Weisbach 2017; Yagan 2015). However, even though they are likely less elastic than capital gains, dividends remain a fi nancial choice for businesses and thus are likely more elastic than real economic decisions such as hiring and investment (Yagan 2015). As noted above, the tax expenditure for preferential rates on qualifi ed dividends is $400 billion over 10 years, and the revenue raised by repealing the preferential rate for dividends would likely be somewhat less. A third incremental proposal would be to raise the tax rate on capital gains to match the rate on ordinary income. However, estimates of the realization response to changes in the capital gains rate suggest that this increase would have more limited revenue-raising potential. Gravelle (2019) suggests the revenue-maximizing capital gains rate according to the modeling at the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Treasury would be under 33 percent if all other features of current law remained the same. She argues that this modeling likely overstates the responsiveness of capital gains realizations, but even so a substantial fraction of potential revenue raised would be lost due to behavior. Ricco (2019) estimates that the revenue-maximizing capital gains rate would be 33 percent under current law and 42 percent if gains were taxed at death as in the fi rst incremental reform option above. Given the responsiveness of capital gains realizations to the tax rate, repealing the preferential rates on capital gains would likely raise substantially less than the $1.2 trillion 10-year tax expenditure estimate even if it were combined with taxing gains at death. Together, treating death or gift as a realization event, repealing the preferential rate for dividends, and raising the tax rate on capital gains and dividends would refl ect an ambitious agenda to reduce tax preferences for capital income. However, the relative ease of avoiding capital gains taxes via strategies that exploit deferral means that these reforms would generate substantially less revenue than more ambitious proposals to tax wealth\u2014but without imposing commensurately lower burden on taxpayers. 6 Th at is, taxing wealth, either through a wealth tax or via accrual taxation, would deliver far higher revenues at modestly higher burden than the incremental package described here. The Proposal Th is section details four alternative approaches to reforming the taxation of wealth: (1) a 2 percent annual wealth tax, (2) a 2 percent annual wealth Greg Leiserson 98 tax with realization-based taxation of non-traded assets, (3) accrual taxa ti o n o f in v e s tm e n t in c o m e o n all typ e s o f as s e ts vi a m ar k - t o- m ar k e t accounting, and (4) accrual taxation of investment income via mark-to-m ar k e t a c c o un ti n g f o r p u b l i c l y tr a d e d a s s e t s c o m b i n e d wi th r e al i z a ti o n -based taxation of gains on non-traded assets when they are sold. Th e realization-based approaches would include a deferral charge on the sale of non-traded assets that would approximately eliminate the benefi ts of deferral. Th e accrual taxation approaches would apply ordinary rates to gains taxed under the accrual system, eff ectively repealing the preferential rates for capital gains and dividends. As noted in the introduction, all four approaches represent reforms to the taxation of wealth, and thus they share many common features both as a ma tter o f im p l emen ta ti o n an d as a ma tter o f eco n o mi cs. Th ey diff er in structure on two main dimensions: whether they tax the stock of wealth or the fl ow of income from wealth, and whether they are based on annual asset valuations or rely on realization for assets that are not publicly traded. As a result of these structural diff erences, the proposals diff er in their treatment of uncertain investment returns, their treatment of assets that deliver nonfi nancial returns, the scope for and ease of integration with the existing income tax, their progressivity, and the risk that the proposals would be declared unconstitutional. Th e choice between the valuation-based approaches and the realization- based approaches depends primarily on (1) the accuracy and opportunities for gaming in the valuation requirement and in the deferral charge, and (2) the costs of preparing valuations and complying with the deferral charge. Th e choice between the wealth tax and the income tax approaches depends primarily on the value of integration with the existing income tax, the importance of including assets for which the primary return is nonfi nancial in the tax base, the impacts of diff erent treatments of uncertain investment returns, the desired level of progressivity, and the weight placed on the risk that the proposal would be declared unconstitutional. Th e wealth tax and accrual tax proposals described here are each calibrated to raise approximately $3 trillion over the next decade. Of course, by modifying the rates and exemptions, the reach of these proposals could be expanded or contracted. A lower rate would impose a lower burden on those aff ected. A higher threshold would exempt more families from the tax and reduce compliance costs (by making fewer households subject for the tax). Both of those advantages would trade against reduced tax revenue. Th e remainder of this section describes each of the four approaches to reforming the taxation of wealth in detail. It fi rst describes the wealth Taxing Wealth 99 tax and then the variation on a wealth tax relying on realization for the purposes of taxing non-traded assets. It next describes accrual taxation via mark-to-market accounting and then the variation of accrual taxation relying on realization for the taxation of non-traded assets. APPROACH 1: THE WEALTH TAX Th e wealth tax would impose an annual 2 percent tax on the market value of each family's wealth in excess of $25 million for married couples and $12.5 million for individual fi lers. Th e total annual value of gift s (other than to charitable organizations) by taxpayers subject to the wealth tax would be subject to an additional gift tax at a rate of 20 percent. 7 Th e Design of the Tax Th e wealth tax would be imposed on a family basis. In contrast to the income tax, dependents' wealth would be included in the wealth of the taxpayer or taxpayers eligible to claim them as dependents, not on a separate return. 8 Th e wealth tax would apply to U.S. citizens and resident aliens who have lived in the United States for more than 10 years.9 Th e wealth tax base would include the worldwide assets and liabilities of those taxpayers. Any tangible personal property not used in connection with a trade or business, that is not a collectible, that is reasonably expected to depreciate, and that is worth less than $25,000 could be excluded from the tax base. Th is exclusion would cover household goods, personal vehicles, and other similar possessions. Taxpayers would be required to apply a consistent method of accounting for purposes of determining the value of diff erent assets and liabilities but would have fl exibility to choose accounting methods suitable for their assets and liabilities. Th ey could adopt diff erent valuation dates for diff erent assets provided that the use of those dates would not be anticipated to result in an inconsistent valuation of the taxpayer's total assets. Th e Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would have authority to issue regulations for segregated accounting of assets resulting from dispositions of assets valued on diff erent dates within the year. For assets that are traded on an exchange, m utual funds, real estate investmen t trusts, other assets for which a quotation is available from an issuer, and derivatives of these assets, taxpayers could elect to use the average value at market close in the last month of the tax year. Th e principle for valuation would be the fair market value of the assets and liabilities. However, no discounts for lack of marketability\u2014a reduction applied to the estimated value of an asset when there is no ready market for Greg Leiserson 100 the asset\u2014would be allowed for any asset for which at least 60 percent of the asset is owned by related parties.10 In the case of closely held businesses, this principle implies that the value of the business would not include any claim to future labor of an owner-employee. Th e value would include only the value of tangible and intangible assets that would convey with the business, including intangible assets such as client lists and business relationships. An important implication is that businesses for which profi ts consist primarily of the labor income of the owners would have relatively low valuations for purposes of the wealth tax ( S mi th et al. 20 1 9 ) . Th is category would likely include many professional service businesses, such as medical practices and law fi rms. Determining the value of fi rms for which the labor of owner-employees represents a substantial fraction of the value of the business would be one of the central compliance and enforcement challenges of a wealth tax. W ealth held in trusts would be an importan t part of the wealth tax base both because substantial wealth is currently held in trusts and because\u2014were trusts not to be covered by the tax\u2014they would be an easy means of avoiding the tax. Th e wealth tax would apply to trusts with no exemption, subject to certain exceptions. First, benefi ciaries with an irrevocable interest, meaning a claim to benefi ts from the trust that cannot be modifi ed or revoked by another party, would be allowed to elect to include in their wealth the fair market value of that interest. If they do so, the trust would be entitled to exclude the value of that interest in determining its wealth tax liability. 11 Hence, smaller trusts that are designed to benefi t individuals who are not themselves wealthy would not owe any tax as the combined value of the trust and the individuals' wealth would be below the wealth tax thresholds. Second, grantor trusts included in the estate of the grantor under the estate tax rules would be included in the wealth tax return for the grantor. Th us, if the combined wealth of the grantor and the trust is below the wealth tax thresholds, there would be no wealth tax liability. Practically, these two exceptions mean that wealth in trusts would not be taxed for most families. However, complicated trusts that cannot be readily attributed to grantors or benefi ciaries and trusts used by high-wealth individuals would pay the tax, ensuring that trusts do not become a vehicle to avoid the wealth tax. In addition to applying the wealth tax to trusts, several additional reforms t o t h e t a x a t i o n o f t r u s t s w o u l d b e i n c l u d e d a s p a r t o f t h i s p r o p o s a l t o address avoidance strategies available under current law that would be even more attractive under a wealth tax. Namely, any retained interest in a trust (meaning a claim to benefi ts from the trust by the person setting Taxing Wealth 101 up the trust) would be valued at zero for gift tax purposes regardless of the nature of that interest. Similarly, retained interests in property contributed to chari tab l e o rganiza ti o ns an d chari tab l e trusts w o ul d be val ued a t zero regardless of the nature of the interest. 12 Careful attention to nonprofi ts is necessary in order to avoid excessive avoidance of the wealth tax through nonprofi t organizations. Pension funds and 501(c)(3) organizations would be exempt from the wealth tax.13 Other nonprofi ts, including 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, which can engage in lobbying and political campaign activities; 501(c)(5) labor unions; and 501(c)(6) chambers of commerce would be subject to the wealth tax. Th ese types of nonprofi ts would be entitled to a $1 million exemption if they abide by the restrictions on lobbying and political activities that apply to 501(c)(3) organizations. Th e proposal would also apply the gift tax to contributions to organizations exempt from tax under 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6). In addition, the proposal would require that in a given year donor-advised funds distribute at least 5 percent of the fair-market value of their assets (as calculated at the end of the prior year), evaluated on an account-by-account basis (not at the level of the sponsoring organization). 14 A wealth tax would create an incentive for wealthy taxpayers to move abroad and relinquish their U.S. citizenship to avoid the tax. Th e proposal therefore includes a one-time tax that would apply upon expatriation; it would be equal to the present value of the tax due on taxable wealth on the day prior to expatriation as computed using actuarial estimates for the mortality of the wealthiest percentile of the population, future investment gains at the rate of infl ation, and a discount rate equal to the federal government's borrowing rate. 15 Information Reporting Th e wealth tax would be supported by a system of information reporting on balance sheet information. Two distinct regimes would apply to fi nancial institutions and businesses. Financial institutions would be subject to a system of information reporting modeled on the provisions of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). A fi nancial institution for purposes of wealth tax information reporting would include any entity that (1) accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business; (2) holds fi nancial assets for the account of others as a substantial portion of its business; (3) is engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, partnership interests, commodities, or any interest in such securities, partnership interests, or commodities; or (4) services loans as a substantial Greg Leiserson 102 portion of its business. Th e fi rst three prongs of this defi nition are taken directly from those for FATCA, while the fourth prong is new, given the importance of liabilities for a wealth tax. I n p a r a l l e l f a s h i o n , fi nancial accounts would include (1) any depository account, (2) any custodial account, (3) any equity or debt interest in a fi nancial institution other than interests that are regularly traded on an established securities market, and (4) any loans serviced by a fi nancial institution. For every fi nancial account maintained by a fi nancial institution, the fi nancial institution would be required to furnish to the taxpayer and to the IRS a statement of the fair market value of the account on the fi nal day of the year to the extent the account or the assets in the account would be considered publicly traded assets. In the case of assets for which the taxpayer may elect to report the average value over the last month, fi nancial institutions would be required to report that value as well. In cases where an account covered by the wealth tax information reporting requirements triggers an information reporting obligation under current law, the fi nancial institution would be allowed to report the information on a single combined return. Financial institutions would be required to report on assets and liabilities for the same set of entities to which FATCA applies, including U.S. citizens, closely held U.S. corporations, partnerships, estates, and trusts. In addition, though FATCA exempts nonprofi ts from the reporting requirements, nonprofi ts other than those exempt under section 501(c)(3) and pension funds would be covered by the system of wealth tax information reporting proposed here. In addition to the general system for information reporting for fi nancial institutions discussed above, any employer that maintains a pension plan would be required to fi le an information return reporting the fair market value of each participant's interest in the plan to each participant and to the IRS. Th e Treasury and the IRS would be authorized to prescribe a set of actuarial assumptions for use in valuing defi ned benefi t pension entitlements. A parallel system of information reporting would apply to any business worth more than $50 million. Such businesses would be required to provide a valuation of the business to the IRS and to all shareholders, partners, or other owners. Th is valuation would include both the value of the business as if it were owned by a single person and the valuation of each of the Taxing Wealth 103 interests in the business.16 Businesses with publicly traded stock could rely on market values as the source of the valuation they report. Businesses worth more than $50 million, and individual taxpayers with an interest in a business worth more than $10 million that is not publicly traded, would be required to fi le an information return with the IRS for any fi nancial transaction that implicitly or explicitly assigns a value to the business. Examples of such transactions would include, but would not be limited to, any sale of stock and any debt issuance that includes a valuation. Th e Treasury and IRS would have authority to determine both the set of transactions that require reporting and to provide relief from the reporting obligation in cases where businesses would otherwise be required to fi le an excessive number of such returns. Th e implied values in fi nancial transaction reports would have no direct bearing on the valuation for wealth tax purposes; rather, they would provide a tool for the IRS to use in enforcement eff orts. Taxpayers who fi le a wealth tax return would be required to disclose if they value assets on their wealth tax return in a manner inconsistent with the value reported by the business on an information return. Th e IRS would b e a b l e t o l i t i g a t e v a l u e s r e p o r t e d o n b u s i n e s s i n f o r m a t i o n r e t u r n s w i t h the business entity. Any change in the valuation resulting from litigation would result in a penalty for misreporting paid by the entity at the wealth tax rate of 2 percent. Taxpayers who reported an inconsistent valuation that was closer to the value determined in litigation would receive a tax credit against wealth tax liabilities for that diff erence multiplied by the wealth tax rate of 2 percent. Taxpayers who reported an inconsistent valuation that was farther from the value determined in litigation would be subject to an additional individual-level tax equal to the diff erence in the values at the wealth tax rate. 17 Finally, state or local governments that impose property taxes could elect to provide property assessments to the IRS. If the IRS determines that the rules governing these assessments would be expected to generate assessments that reasonably approximate market value, taxpayers could rely on the property assessments provided by the state or local government in fi ling their wealth tax return. Th e information reporting regime proposed here requires additional information from large businesses and from fi nancial institutions, which tend to operate at large scale. It includes an elective regime for state and local governments, which already collect the relevant information. Th e system avoids imposing broad new information reporting requirements on Greg Leiserson 104 smaller entities and does not require any wealth tax fi lings from individual taxpayers who are exempt from the wealth tax. Administration Th e statute of limitations for any adjustments to tax resulting from disputed valuations for non-traded assets would run six years from the disposition of the asset, where the defi nition of non-traded assets is the same as that described below in the context of the realization-based wealth tax proposal. For any non-traded asset with a value in excess of $5 million when sold, the taxpayer would be required to provide an annual valuation for the asset from the time of purchase to the time of sale with their wealth tax return following the sale. Th e valuation in each year would be based on the information known at that time, not the information known at the time of sale. If the taxpayer chooses to adjust valuations for prior years, they would be required to pay any resulting additional tax or receive a refund of reduced tax with interest. Interest would be paid on overpayments at the federal government's 10-year rate. Interest would be charged on underpayments at the federal government's 30-year rate plus two percentage points. To minimize the costs of valuation disputes and to encourage taxpayers t o a d o p t m o r e a ccura t e val ua ti o n s w h e n ini ti all y fi ling their tax returns, courts would be required to choose either the taxpayer' s valuation or the IRS's proposed alternative valuation in resolving valuation disputes (Soled 1997). In addition, if a court adopts the IRS's valuation for any year, the IRS could adopt an irrebuttable presumption that the value on the asset from purchase through that year accum ulated in an equal dollar amoun t each year. However, the IRS would not be required to adopt this valuation. Any underpayment of tax attributable to a substantial wealth tax valuation understatement\u2014defi ned as a valuation of 65 percent or less of the fair market value (or the value resulting from litigation, if applicable) in one y ear o r 80 per cen t o r l ess o f th e val ue in m o r e than o n e y ear\u2014 w o ul d be subject to a penalty equal to 100 percent of the underpayment of tax. Any other underpayment would be subject to a penalty equal to 20 percent of the tax. Th ese penalties would not apply to underpayments of tax that were identifi ed by the taxpayer and resolved through the voluntary reconciliation process discussed above. Transition to a Wealth Tax A wealth tax encourages aff ected taxpayers to distribute assets to family members, charities, and others to reduce the wealth subject to tax. Th us, Taxing Wealth 105 the proposed wealth taxes would include provisions to police these types of transfers, including through increased gift taxes and exit taxes. A key issue in the transition to a wealth tax would be limiting the extent to which these transfers would occur prior to the eff ective date of the tax. Legislation enacting a wealth tax should apply higher gift taxes to any transfers made aft er the introduction of legislation in Congress and should apply the exit tax to any expatriations aft er that date. Certain assets embed deferred tax liabilities. For example, a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) valued at $1 million is worth less than a Roth IRA valued at $1 million because distributions from the traditional IRA will be taxable but those from the Roth IRA will not be. Adoption of a wealth tax may encourage taxpayers to realize deferred tax liabilities today in order to reduce wealth tax liabilities. However , this acceleration of tax payments does not necessarily pose any problems, so policies to prevent it are largely unnecessary. APPROACH 2: THE REALIZATION-BASED WEALTH TAX Th e realization-based version of the wealth tax would impose an annual 2 percent tax on publicly traded assets and a similar retrospective tax on non-traded assets when they are sold. Th e Design of the Tax Th e realization-based wealth tax would impose an annual wealth tax with the features described above on publicly traded assets and would impose a separate tax on non-traded assets when they are sold. T axing non-traded assets on a realization basis with an appropriate deferral charge avoids the need to estimate the value of these assets on an annual basis but creates a number of challenging design issues regarding the treatment of non-traded assets and additional scope for tax avoidance. Th e tax due when a non-traded asset is sold would be computed as the wealth tax that would have been due over the duration of the investment in the asset if the return on that asset in each year had been equal to the 30-year Treasury rate plus 2 percent, accumulated over time at the aft er-tax rate of return in the top income tax bracket. 18 Th e use of a relatively low rate of return for these purposes is intended to discourage the conversion of publicly traded assets into non-traded assets as a means of tax avoidance. For example, suppose a fully taxable investor held an asset for two years and sold it for $1 million. 19 Assume the 30-year Treasury rate is 2 percent and the top federal income tax bracket is 40 percent. Th en the wealth tax due Greg Leiserson 106 upon sale of the asset would be 0.02*($1 million) + 0.02*($1 million)/1.04*(1 + 0.04*(1 - 0.40)) = $39,692. Because this is a wealth tax and not a tax on income, computation of the tax is based on the total realized value of $1 million, and thus this asset sale would generate this tax liability whether the purchase price was $900,000, $1 million, or $1.5 million. 20 Since non-traded assets are taxed only when sold, additional taxes must be imposed on dividends and other distributions to prevent taxpayers from using such distributions to reduce the value of a non-traded asset prior to sale. Dividends and other distributions from non-traded C and S corporations would be subject to tax in the same manner as would proceeds from the sale of a non-traded asset. Distributions from other non-traded pass-through entities would be subject to tax to the extent they refl ected a return on capital rather than labor income. Just as with the wealth tax itself, where taxpayers would need to value businesses independent of the future labor income of the owner, distinguishing distributions that refl ect a return on capital from those that refl ect a return on labor would be a central compliance and enforcement challenge of the realization-based version of the tax. 21 Taxpayers would be required to make estimated tax payments equal to 2 percent of the basis in their non-traded assets. Estimated tax payments would accrue interest at the 30-year Treasury rate. Th e estimated tax that could be applied against the tax due on the sale of a non-traded asset, or the dividends paid by that non-traded asset, would be limited to the estimated tax paid on that asset. Refunds of estimated tax paid on a non-traded asset that declined in value would be available without limit. Th e defi nition of traded assets would be modeled on the defi nitions used in the original issue discount regulations, and would include any assets traded on an exchange, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, assets for which an issuer stands ready to sell or redeem any interests, and derivatives the price of which is determined by reference to any of the above. 22 Ownership interests in entities for which more than 20 percent of the value is attributable to publicly traded securities would be treated as two distinct ownership interests, one in a traded asset and one in a non-traded asset. H o w ev e r , p u b li cl y tra d ed securi ti es r easo n ab l y h e l d in th e co n d u ct of a nonfi nancial trade or business could be treated as part of a non-traded ownership interest in that business. Taxpayers would be required to fi le a wealth tax return in any year in which the value of their assets exceeds $25 million for married couples and $12.5 million for single fi lers. However, only the value of publicly traded assets and sales of non-traded assets would be reported on the return. Taxing Wealth 107 Any taxpayer could elect to fi le a return. Th e retrospective tax would be due only in years in which the market value of a taxpayer's wealth exceeds the exemption threshold, eff ectively allowing taxpayers to adopt a market valuation of non-traded assets when that value is lower than the imputed value of non-traded assets if their total assets lie below the threshold. Some taxpayers near the thresholds may choose to incur the costs of a valuation of their non-traded assets to determine whether they need to fi le, and others may simply choose to fi le and report the value of their publicly traded assets. Information Reporting and Administration Th e information reporting for and administration of the realization-based wealth tax would broadly follow that of the valuation-based wealth tax but would be simplifi ed in two important ways. First, under the realization- based wealth tax, large businesses would not be required to report estimated valuations. Second, the requirement that taxpayers provide a series of historical valuations when assets are sold would not be imposed under the realization-based wealth tax. Th ese features are unnecessary under the realization-based wealth tax because this approach relies on realized sales proceeds rather than valuations for non-traded assets. Transition to a Realization-Based Wealth Tax Th e realization-based wealth tax would require a one-time valuation event for non-traded assets at the end of the taxable year before it takes eff ect. Tax on unrealized gains at the time of the transition would be calculated but could be deferred until the assets are ultimately sold. Interest would be imposed on the deferred tax until assets were sold. APPROACH 3: ACCRUAL TAXATION Th e accrual tax would require mark-to-market accounting for all assets for married couples with more than $16.5 million in gross assets and individuals with more than $8.25 million in gross assets, subject to a phase-in described below. Th e preferential rates on capital gains and dividends would not apply to gains and losses taxed under the accrual system. Th e Design of the Tax Taxpayers would include in their income each year mark-to-market gains and losses, defi ned as the change in the value of their worldwide assets and liabilities.Greg Leiserson 108 Married couples with less than $16.5 million in gross assets and individuals with less than $8.25 million in gross assets would be unaff ected by the proposed accrual tax. Th ese taxpayers would continue to pay tax under the current-law realization system of capital gains taxation. Th e inclusion of mark-to-market gains and losses in income would phase in between $16.5 million and $33 million of assets. Taxpayers would include in their income a share of mark-to-market gains and losses computed as the ratio of the excess of their assets over $16.5 million to $16.5 million. Th e value of assets used in computing the phase-in percentage would be the average of the taxpayer's current-year valuation and prior-year valuation of their assets. 23 For taxpayers in the phase-in range, the basis of each asset would be increased (decreased) by the share of the gain (loss) included in income. In other words, if a taxpayer includes 50 percent of all gain in income given their position in the phase-in region, then the basis of each asset would be increased by 50 percent of the gain on that asset. As with the wealth tax proposals above, the principle for valuation under the accrual taxes would be the fair market value of the assets and liabilities. No discounts for lack of marketability would be allowed for any asset for which at least 60 percent of the asset is owned by related parties, and the valuation of closely held businesses would exclude any value attributable to future labor income of the owner. Taxpayers would be required to apply a consistent method of accounting for purposes of determining the value of diff erent assets and liabilities but would have fl exibility to choose accounting methods suitable for their assets and liabilities. Taxpayers could adopt diff erent valuation dates for diff erent assets. For assets that are traded on an exchange, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, other assets for which a quotation is available from an issuer, and derivatives of these assets, taxpayers could elect to use the average value at market close in the last month of the tax year. 24 Losses on personal-use property would not be deductible. Losses on all other property could be deducted against mark-to-market gains, interest, dividends, and income from pass-through businesses. Losses could be deducted against other forms of ordinary income up to the current $3,000 limit and could be carried back one year or carried forward indefi nitely. Put diff erently, this proposal would expand the types of income against which losses could be deducted without limit relative to current law to include interest, dividends, and pass-through income, but would retain the $3,000 limit for other types of income.Taxing Wealth 109 As wi th th e w eal th tax , r e f o rm s t o th e taxa ti o n o f trus ts ar e r e q uir e d t o prevent avoidance. Trusts would be subject to the requirement for mark-to-market accounting with no exemption. However, as with the wealth tax, trusts could exclude assets attributed to a benefi ciary with an irrevocable interest and certain grantors. Th e accrual taxation proposals would be accompanied by the same reforms to the trust rules that accompany the wealth tax proposals, which disregard any retained interests for purposes of computing gift tax liabilities. Th e taxation of pass-through entities under the accrual tax would be designed to ensure a consistent, single layer of tax on income earned through these entities. S corporation stock, partnership interests, and sole proprietorships would be included in the assets covered by the mark-to-market regime, and changes in the value of those interests would be included in income each year. 25 Taxpayers would receive a deduction against the change in the value of each interest equal to the income from that pass-through businesses included on their tax return and would include in their income any distributions from the pass-through business. Gains from the sale or exchange of property realized by the pass-through entity subsequent to the adoption of the accrual taxation system would be excluded from income for taxpayers under the accrual taxation regime, meaning that appreciation would be taxed on the pass-through owner's tax return when it occurs, and not when the assets are sold. 26 In eff ect, the proposal would tax pass-through owners on the sum of pass- through income (as defi ned under current law but for the exclusion of post- transition gains on the sale of property) and net appreciation of the pass-through interest. 27 Th is approach would be equivalent to a tax imposed on distributions plus the change in value of the ownership interest, a defi nition of income that directly parallels the Haig-Simons defi nition. Th e alternative bucketing (pass-through income and net appreciation) is adopted under t h i s p r o p o s a l b o t h b e c a u s e o f t h e s t r o n g e r c o n n e c t i o n t o c u r r e n t - l a w practices and because the pass-through income concept is likely easier to administer and enforce. 28 In addition, the loss limitations described above would apply to changes in market value, but not to losses passed through directly from the business. As with the wealth tax proposal above, this proposal would apply gift taxes to gift s to 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6) organizations and would require donor-advised funds to distribute at least 5 percent of their assets each year, evaluated on an account-by-account basis. As noted above, the accrual taxation proposal aims to deliver a single, uniform layer of tax on investment income as it accrues for wealthy Greg Leiserson 110 households. In keeping with this goal, the proposal would also limit the value of tax-preferred retirement accounts. Taxpayers would be required to take distributions from defi ned contribution retirement accounts and IRAs equal to the excess of the value of all defi ned benefi t, defi ned contribution, and IRA balances over $3 million per taxpayer. Any portion of the e x c e s s a tt r i b u t a b l e t o d e fi ned benefi t balances once defi ned contribution and IRA balances have been reduced to zero would generate an income inclusion equal to the 30-year Treasury rate multiplied by the value of the undistributed excess. For the same reason, taxpayers who are subject to the accrual tax regime would receive a credit against taxes on dividend income for corporate taxes paid, modeled on the proposal of Toder and Viard (2016). Corporate tax liabilities would generate tentative credits at the entity level. Th ese credits would be paid out at 25 cents per dollar of dividends paid. Taxpayers would include in income the 25-cent credit and would apply the credit against their tax due. Tentative credits would be drawn down regardless of the identity of the recipient of the dividend. In other words, dividends paid to a nonprofi t owner of corporate stock would reduce the stock of tentative credits available at the entity level. In general, C corporations, S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships would not be required to mark their assets to market for purposes of determining corporate taxable income or income to be passed through to their shareholders or partners. However, life insurance companies and fi nancial institutions would be required to determine investment income under mark-to-market rules. Th is requirement is necessary to prevent these entities from eff ectively selling the benefi ts of deferral to their customers. 29 Taxpayers covered by the accrual tax regime in one year whose assets fall below the minimum threshold for inclusion in the following year could choose to remain in the regime or to exit. Th ey must make this choice prior to the fi ling deadline for the year in which the threshold is crossed. Information Reporting Th e information reporting regime for the accrual taxation proposal would generally follow the regime for the wealth tax proposal discussed above for both fi nancial institutions and businesses. However, under the accrual taxation proposal, fi nancial institutions w o u l d b e r e q u i r e d t o r e p o r t t o e a c h a c c o u n t h o l d e r th e m a r k - t o - m a r k e t gains and losses on the publicly traded assets in their accounts rather Taxing Wealth 111 than the value of the account. As under the wealth tax proposal, fi nancial institutions would be permitted to combine this information return with other required information returns for accounts that trigger information reporting obligations under current law. In the case of businesses, the entities would still be required to report valuations, and the taxpayers would be responsible for reconciling the change in value with any purchases, sales, contributions, distributions, or other transactions during the year. As under the wealth tax proposal, the IRS would be able to litigate valuations with the business entity. Any adjustment to the value of the business would generate a misreporting penalty equal to the top statutory income tax rate multiplied by the change in the valuation. Th is payment would pass through to owners who could then reconcile on their own returns and would be able to claim a tax credit or would be required to pay an additional tax to the extent that they asserted a valuation diff erent from that originally reported by the business entity. Administration Parallel to the case of the wealth tax, the statute of limitations for reporting o f m ar k - t o - m ar k e t g ai n s an d l o s s e s o n a s s e t s o th e r th an p u b l i c l y t r a d e d assets would run six years from the sale of the asset. For any asset with a v a l u e i n e x c e s s o f $ 5 m i l l i o n a t t h e t i m e o f d i s p o s i t i o n , t h e t a x p a y e r would be required to provide an annual valuation at the time of sale that reconciles prior valuations with the ultimate sales price. As with the wealth tax, the taxpayer would pay any resulting additional tax or receive a refund of reduced tax with interest if they choose to adjust prior-year valuations at the time of sale. In litigation, courts would be required to choose either the taxpayer's valuation or the IRS's proposed alternative valuation in resolving valuation disputes (Soled 1997). Th e IRS would have the option to choose an irrebuttable presumption that the gain on an asset had accrued at an equal-dollar amount each year if the courts adopt its proposed valuation. Transition to an Accrual Tax An accrual tax taxes investment gains that arise aft er the eff ective date. Taxpayers thus have an incentive to infl ate asset values on the eff ective date, which would have the eff ect of deferring tax on gains until assets are sold and reducing the deferral charge. To reduce this incentive, taxpayers would be required to value assets at the end of the tax year that includes the date of enactment and then pay interest on the unrealized gains until the assets are sold or transferred via gift or bequest. At that point, the deferred tax would be due. Th is valuation event would also be required to allocate Greg Leiserson 112 g ains o n p r o pe rty h el d b y pass- thr o ugh e n ti ti es in t o p r e- trans i ti o n g ains and post-transition gains. APPROACH 4: THE REALIZATION-BASED ACCRUAL TAX Th e realization-based accrual tax would require mark-to-market accounting for publicly traded assets as described above and would impose a deferral charge on non-traded assets when they are sold. Th e preferential rates on capital gains and dividends would not apply to gains and losses taxed under the accrual system or those subject to the deferral charge. Th e Design of the Tax Th e realization-based accrual tax would tax gains and losses on publicly traded assets on an annual basis but would impose tax on the gains on non-traded assets only when they are sold. Th e set of traded assets would follow the defi nition proposed for the realization-based wealth tax, and would include any assets traded on an exchange, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, assets for which an issuer stands ready to sell or redeem any interests, and derivatives the price of which is determined by reference to any of the above. Ownership interests in entities for which more than 20 percent of the value is attributable to publicly traded securities would be treated as two distinct ownership interests\u2014one in a traded asset and one in a non-traded asset. However, publicly traded securities reasonably held in the conduct of a nonfi nancial trade or business could be treated as part of a non-traded ownership interest in that business. Th e tax due when a non-traded asset is sold would be computed assuming that there was a constant rate of return on the investment asset from the point of purchase to the point of sale, income tax imposed at the top marginal income tax rate in eff ect in each year plus the net investment income tax rate if applicable, and the resulting tax accumulated at the aft er-tax return in the top bracket, assuming the 30-year Treasury rate plus 3 percent. For example, an asset purchased for $1 million and sold for $2 million two years later would be assumed to have appreciated at an annual rate of 41 percent, and thus have generated income in the fi rst year of $414,000 and in the second year of $586,000. If the top marginal rate plus net investment income tax rate in eff ect were 40.8 percent in each year, and the 30-year Treasury rate 3 percent, the tax due upon sale would be 0.408*414,000*(1 + 0.06*(1 - 0.408)) + 0.408*586,000 = $414,000.Taxing Wealth 113 Since non-traded assets are taxed only when sold, additional rules specifi c to non-traded C corporations are necessary to prevent taxpayers from using dividends or other distributions to reduce the value of a non-traded asset prior to sale and thus avoid tax. When an ownership interest in a non-traded C corporation is sold, dividends and other distributions previously paid by the C corporation would be accumulated at the same rate used to accumulate tax under the deferral charge (the 30-year Treasury rate plus 3 percent) and would be added to the sales proceeds for purposes of computing the total gain under the realization-based accrual tax. Taxes paid on distributions would be credited against the tax due, assuming such taxes were paid at the top rate in each year and had accumulated over time at the same interest rate. When an o wnership in terest in a non - traded pass- through en tity is sold, owners would pay tax on the gain and compute the deferral charge as described above (without regard to the special rules for C corporations) based on the sales proceeds, basis, and timing of investments in the asset. In addition, when a pass-through entity sells a non-traded asset, the pass-through would compute a deferral charge on the asset and pass through that additional tax to owners as a tax surcharge. 30 Taxpayers would be required to make estimated tax payments for their non-traded assets equal to 2 percent of the taxpayer's basis in their non-traded assets. Estimated tax payments would accrue interest at the 30-year Treasury rate. Th e estimated tax that could be applied against the tax due on the sale of a non-traded asset would be limited to the estimated tax paid on that asset. Refunds of estimated tax paid on a non-traded asset that declined in value would be available without limit. Th e Treasury would have the authority to issue regulations to accelerate the timing of income when further investments in an asset are made shortly before sale that may serve to delay the timing of income under the constant return assumption. 31 Under the realization-based accrual taxation proposal, death, gift s, and charitable contributions would be treated as realization events for all covered taxpayers. Th us, any unrealized gains on non-traded assets at the time of death, gift , or charitable contributions would be taxed at that time. Losses on non-traded assets could be carried forward without interest and could not be applied against ordinary income. In addition, trusts would be required to value assets and to realize gains no less frequently than once a decade.Greg Leiserson 114 Taxpayers whose assets fall below the minimum threshold for inclusion in the accrual taxation regime could choose to remain in the regime or exit. If they elect to exit, that exit would be treated as a realization event for non-traded assets and the tax computed as above. Taxpayers must make this choice prior to the fi ling deadline for the year in which the threshold is crossed. Information Reporting and Administration Th e information reporting for and administration of the realization-based accrual tax would generally follow that of the valuation-based accrual tax with some simplifi cations, much as the realization-based wealth tax off ered some simplifi cations relative to the valuation-based wealth tax. First, large businesses would not be required to report estimated valuations. Second, the requirement that taxpayers provide a series of historical valuations when assets are sold would not be imposed under the realization-based accrual tax. Th ese features are unnecessary under the realization-based a p p r o a c h b e c a u s e t h i s a p p r o a c h r e l i e s o n r e a l i z e d s a l e s p r o c e e d s r a t h e r than on valuations for non-traded assets. Transition to a Realization-Based Accrual Tax Th e transition to a realization-based accrual tax would proceed in the same way as the transition to a valuation-based accrual tax. A one-time valuation would occur at the end of the taxable year prior to the enactment of the system. Taxpayers would compute tax on unrealized gains (without the deferral charge), could defer this tax until the asset is sold, and would pay interest on the tax while it is deferred. The Economic Effects of Taxing Wealth T axi n g w e al th u n d e r an y o f th e f o u r a p p r o a c h e s i n th i s p r o p o s al w o ul d raise substantial revenues and increase burden. Th e burden imposed would be highly progressive and would overwhelmingly aff ect the wealthiest families. Th e ultimate impact of each approach would depend on the use of funds, and all four approaches could fi nance policies that would increase living standards for the overwhelming majority of the population. Th is section fi rst summarizes the revenues raised and burden imposed by the wealth tax and the accrual tax. It then considers the use of funds and evaluates the approaches through the lens of effi ciency. Finally, it considers the choice between the wealth-based approaches and the income-based approaches and the choice between the valuation-based approaches and the realization-based approaches.Taxing Wealth 115 REVENUES RAISED Th e wealth tax and the accrual tax described above have been calibrated to raise $3 trillion between 2021 and 2030, ignoring transitional revenues raised by the accrual taxation proposal and the cost of the proposal for corporate integration. 32 Appendix B provides additional methodological details and discussion of the uncertainties. Separate estimates of the revenues raised by the realization-based versions of each tax are not presented in this chapter due to the limited evidence on which to base an estimate of the diff erences between the valuation-based approaches and the realization-based approaches. BURDEN IMPOSED Both the wealth tax and the accrual tax would sharply increase the tax burden on the wealthiest households. Table 1 provides a distribution analysis of the two proposals by wealth for 2021. Th e wealth tax proposal would increase tax burdens by $450 billion in 2021, with essentially all of that burden being borne by the wealthiest 1 percent of households. 33 Th e accrual taxation proposal would increase tax burdens by $376 billion in 2021, with 98 percent of that borne by the top 1 percent. However, the wealth tax would be more heavily concentrated among the very wealthiest households. In fact, 77 percent of the burden of the wealth tax would fall on the top 0.1 percent of households and only 63 percent of the burden of the accrual tax would fall on those households. Th e accrual tax would also aff ect more households (0.8 percent of all households) than the wealth tax (0.5 percent). Incomes for the wealthiest 1 percent, measured in accrual terms, would fall by 15 percent under the wealth tax and by 12 percent under the accrual taxation proposal. Although a distribution by wealth is natural for evaluating proposals to tax wealth, most tax distribution analysis is conducted by income. Table 2 provides a distribution analysis for the two proposals by an accrual measure of income. As the table shows, almost 96 percent of the burden of the wealth tax would be borne by households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, and almost 91 percent of the burden of the accrual tax would fall on these households. Aft er-tax incomes in the highest-income 1 percent would fall by 13 percent under the wealth tax and by 10 percent under the accrual tax. Importantly , this analysis uses an accrual measure of income rather than relying on a realization-based measure of income. An accrual measure of income includes investment gains as they accrue, whereas a realization-based measure of income includes investment gains only when they are Greg Leiserson 116 realized. Since the current tax system operates on a realization basis, most distribution analysis is conducted using realization-based measures of income. Doing so ensures alignment between the taxes collected and the income measure, and thus facilitates computation of tax rates. Th is analysis uses an accrual measure of income instead of a realization-based measure because both the wealth tax and the accrual tax are more tightly linked to accrual income. Notably, since the distribution analysis presented here is for a future year, the accrual income measure is eff ectively a measure of expected accrual income. In practice, accrual measures of income will be negative in many years.TABLE 1.

Due to rounding, \"Share of total change\" may not sum to 100.Most traditional tax distribution analyses assume that behavioral responses to a tax change do not aff ect the welfare of the people making those changes, an assumption that can be justifi ed by standard economic theory.34 Th us, these behavioral responses do not aff ect the tax burden shown in a distribution analysis (Cronin 1999; In other words, a taxpayer who avoids $1 of wealth tax liability reduces revenues by $1 but does not materially reduce their own tax burden in avoiding tax. Distribution analyses do, however, recognize that the incidence of a tax change is potentially shift ed from the agent bearing the statutory burden of the tax to other actors. Together these assumptions mean that a distribution analysis provides an estimate of the impact of tax legislation on utility or well-being as opposed to income.Greg Leiserson 118 Th is analysis assumes that the economic incidence of both a wealth tax and accrual taxation of investment income lies on wealth owners and the recipients of investment income, eff ectively assuming that wage rates and rates of return are unchanged by the reforms. Th is assumption amounts to the assumption that the taxes do not aff ect the capital-labor ratio because any reduction in wealth by the extremely wealthy is off set by increases in savings by the merely wealthy or foreign investors, because the decision-making of fi rms is assumed not to be sensitive to the tax rate in the tail of the investor wealth distribution, or some combination of these and other factors. 35 Th is incidence assumption is consistent with the incidence assumptions used for individual income tax reforms\u2014and thus changes in investor-level taxes on investment income\u2014by the JCT and the Treasury. However, there are no existing analyses of wealth taxes from either agency that describe how the agencies would assess such a tax, though the underlying economic similarities between wealth taxes and taxes on investment income would argue for distributing them in a similar fashion. Th e assumption that the economic incidence of taxes on wealth and investment income lies on wealth owners and the recipients of investment income contrasts with the common assumption that the economic incidence of the corporate tax is partially borne by workers. Th e JCT and the Treasury assume a relatively modest share of the incidence of the corporate tax lies on labor (about 25 percent) and the remainder lies on capital (JCT 2013; Treasury 2015b). Th is diff erence in assumptions is appropriate given the economic diff erences between the taxes. Taxes on savers, including taxes on wealth and investment income, aff ect the supply of funds available for investment. Taxes on business entities, including the corporate tax, aff ect the deployment of capital in business activity. Targeted taxes on wealthy savers likely have little material eff ect on the fi nancial market equilibrium and thus have little eff ect on investment decisions. As a result, the burden of such taxes is relatively less likely to shift from wealth owners and recipients of investment income to workers or other groups. On the other hand, general taxes on business activity are more likely to aff ect investment decisions, and thus the burden of such taxes is more likely to shift , in part, to workers or other groups. As with revenues, separate estimates of the burden imposed by the realization-based versions of each tax are not presented in this chapter due to the limited evidence on which to base an estimate of the diff erences Taxing Wealth 119 between the valuation-based approaches and the realization-based approaches. Traditional distribution analysis is well suited to changes in existing taxes, but it is less well suited to the creation of a fundamentally new tax or a major structural change like eliminating realization. For an incremental change in the tax rate, the private costs and benefi ts of the incremental change in avoidances are approximately identical and thus can be disregarded. However, for the creation of a new tax like the wealth tax or a major change in structure of the tax system like eliminating realization, the private costs and benefi ts of changes in behavior are not necessarily equal and thus can aff ect well-being. In the case of the taxation of wealth there are four major possibilities worth considering: Taxpayers may stop engaging in costly avoidance of taxes through strategies relying on exploiting realization, since realization is no longer as important a trigger of tax liability. Taxpayers may start engaging in costly avoidance of the wealth and mark-to-market income taxes through strategies that were irrelevant under the realization-based tax system. Taxpayers may avoid tax through increased charitable contributions, reducing revenues while generating gains for benefi ciaries and stakeholders of the recipient organizations. Taxpayers may transfer assets to other individuals to reduce or avoid tax, thus reducing revenues while generating gains for transfer recipients at relatively modest costs for the donor. 36 Due to the limited evidence available on the behavioral responses to taxes on wealth and investment income, I do not attempt to quantify how these factors would aff ect the distribution analyses described above. However, these factors would not change the qualitative nature of the results. Th e proposed taxes on wealth would sharply increase burdens at the top of the distribution and would have only modest eff e c t s o n t h e r e s t o f t h e distribution. Likely the most important caveat to the basic analysis is that the burden analysis presented here assumes that tax evasion aff ecting business assets reduces revenues but does not reduce burden. (See appendix B for additional discussion of the assumptions underlying the revenue estimates.) However, to the extent the costs of this evasion are incurred under the existing income Greg Leiserson 120 tax, this evasion would also be refl ected in reduced burden. As a result, the burden impacts shown in tables 1 and 2 are likely somewhat conservative, in the sense of overstating the increase in burden that would result from the proposals. A portion of the revenue loss due to avoidance would also, as a result of these adjustments, reduce burden. Th is adjustment would be largest for avoidance resulting from transfers to other taxpayers. Th e increase in charitable contributions also has the potential to reduce burden\u2014off ering an implicit tax cut\u2014for low- and moderate-income households, making them better off even without considering the use of the revenues raised. Th i s i m p a c t w o u l d a l m o s t c e r t a i n l y b e m o d e s t r e l a t i v e t o t h e i m p a c t resulting from the use of funds, however. Finally, asset price eff ects could aff ect the distribution analysis. Should asset prices fall upon enactment of the tax, a portion of the burden shown above would shift from those holding assets in the future to those holding assets at the time of enactment. (To the extent such eff ects are anticipated, of course, these eff ects could occur even prior to enactment of the legislation and the burden could be borne by those holding assets at key moments in the legislative process when the probability of enactment increases.) Shift ing via asset prices is not typically refl ected in distribution analysis, though to the extent it occurs it should be refl ected in the more fulsome modifi ed analysis sketched here. However, as discussed in appendix B, asset price eff ects are likely to be modest in the case of the taxes proposed here. COMPLIANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS Adopting a wealth tax or accrual taxation of investment income would impose additional compliance and administrative costs. Compliance costs are costs borne by the public in fulfi lling their tax obligations, and administrative costs are those incurred by the IRS in administering the tax. Although these costs are central in the public debate about taxing wealth, there is relatively little evidence on which to base an estimate of these costs. Th e compliance costs most relevant for an assessment of proposals to tax wealth are those incurred in fi ling returns, such as the costs for legal, accounting, and appraisal services. Importantly, the net benefi ts and costs of the increase in planning to avoid a wealth tax or accrual taxation of investment income are already refl ected in the revenue and tax burden estimates above. Th e costs of this planning are one of the reasons the dollar-valued burden in the distribution analysis exceeds the dollar-valued increase in revenues. However, the compliance costs associated with Taxing Wealth 121 fulfi lling baseline obligations are not included in the burden estimates in the distribution analysis. R ela tiv el y li ttl e evi de n ce is a vailab l e o n whi ch t o base an estima te o f th e direct compliance costs for wealth or accrual taxation. I start by borrowing an approach from the literature on estate taxation, where a back-of-the-envelope estimate can be obtained from information about deductible expenses on estate tax returns (Davenport and Soled 1999; Gale and Slemrod 2000, 2001; Schmalbeck 2001). Estate tax returns fi led in 2017 with gross estate in excess of $20 million claimed deductions for attorneys' fees equal to 0.2 percent of the gross estate and deductions for other expenses (a catch-all category that includes appraisal fees) of 0.4 percent. If half of these costs are attributable to tax compliance obligations\u2014the assumption made for estate tax purposes in the Davenport and Soled analysis\u2014compliance costs would amount to 0.3 percent of wealth. Th e proposed wealth tax here diff ers from the estate tax on two main dimensions. First, while the estate tax relies on self-reports, the proposed wealth tax would involve substantial information reporting. Th is would tend to increase costs by expanding the universe of aff ected assets and creating additional reporting obligations and would tend to reduce costs by facilitating shared reliance on a single valuation and concentrating valuation responsibilities where expertise is greatest. Second, the wealth tax would apply annually, off ering scope for cost savings through economies of scale and repeated reliance on similar methods. Lacking direct evidence, I assume these two factors allow for a one-third reduction in compliance costs per dollar of gross wealth under the wealth tax relative to the estate tax, primarily as a result of the centralization of valuation costs due to information reporting. Since the expense ratios mentioned above are computed using reported estate tax data, the value of the gross estate is already reduced by evasion and some forms of avoidance. In applying this cost ratio here, I therefore apply the expense ratio aft er evasion and with half of the assumed avoidance refl ected in the wealth value. 37 Comparing total compliance costs to wealth tax revenues yields a ratio of 19 percent. Th is ratio exceeds the ratio of the expense ratio to the tax rate because of the exemption and the assumption that compliance costs should be computed on a base that does not refl ect all avoidance assumed under the wealth tax itself. Th e ratio of compliance costs to revenues for the accrual tax could be larger or smaller than the ratio under the wealth tax. Th e accrual tax Greg Leiserson 122 imposes a smaller tax on more people, which would tend to increase the ratio of compliance costs to revenues because the primary driver of costs is the measurement of wealth and income. On the other hand, the accrual tax would eliminate compliance costs associated with the current-law realization-based system of taxation for those under the new system and would not require fi ling an additional return, both of which would tend to reduce compliance costs. Notably, as discussed in the revenue estimation section above, the more modest increase in rates under the accrual proposal results in a smaller avoidance response to the accrual taxation, highlighting one set of trade-off s between the various types of costs resulting from the diff erent proposals. One recent estimate of the compliance costs of the income tax suggests these costs are just over 10 percent of revenues (Marcuss et al. 2013). However, the authors suggest this is a lower bound since it does not include the costs of information reporting or withholding. Th is comparison suggests that the compliance costs of a wealth tax or accrual taxation of investment income would exceed those of the existing income tax, but not unduly so given the highly progressive nature of the proposed tax instruments and their focus on strengthening the taxation of income from wealth, one of the more challenging types of income to tax. Since the primary driver of compliance costs is the measurement of income and, in particular valuation, the realization-based approaches would reduce compliance costs relative to the valuation-based approaches. In the extreme, if the realization-based approaches were to incur no additional costs for valuation, they would potentially cut compliance cost by more than half relative to the valuation-based approach, assuming all other expenses reported on estate tax returns are attributable to valuation costs. However, as discussed in greater detail below, adopting a realization-based system would open the door to additional tax avoidance strategies, and rules to prevent these types of avoidance strategies would come with their own attendant compliance costs. Th e relative merits of the two approaches depend on the costs and benefi ts of this trade-off . A robust fi nding of the literature of tax administration is that the private compliance costs of tax collection far exceed the administrative costs in curr ed b y th e IRS. Th e IRS estimates that it incurred costs of 34 cents per $100 of gross tax collected in fi s c a l y e a r 2 0 1 8 , o r 0 . 3 4 p e r c e n t ( I R S 2019). Th is cost has declined from a recent high of 5 3 cents in fi scal year 2010. However, the cost of administering a wealth tax or accrual taxation of investment income would likely exceed this average. Davenport and Soled (1999) estimate that the administrative costs for the federal estate Taxing Wealth 123 tax amount to 0.6 percent of revenues raised. Pichet (2007) reports that the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance estimated administrative costs of 1.6 percent for the French wealth tax in 1997. Th is was modestly higher than the 1.4 percent average for French tax collections. As the recent decline in costs for the IRS indicates, there is no single level of administration costs for a single tax. Higher administration spending can reduce the tax gap, reduce private compliance burdens, or deliver other benefi ts, while lower administration spending reduces the need for revenues to pay for that spending. Th e same would be true of reformed taxes of wealth. To generate a ballpark estimate for appropriate spending on these reforms to the taxation of wealth, I scale the recent high-water mark for operating costs relative to revenues raised by the ratio of wealth tax costs to average costs for France in 1997, which yields a cost per dollar of revenues of 0.6 percent. Applying this percentage to the $3 trillion revenue target for the next decade would suggest an increase in IRS appropriations of $18 billion over that time period, or about 12 percent. Notably, IRS a p p r o p ria ti o ns ha v e declin ed b y abo u t 20 per cen t in r eal terms sin ce th e recent high-water mark in 2010. An increase in appropriations at more than this scale would likely be merited merely to enforce existing tax law (CBO 2018; Sarin, Summers, and Kupferberg 2020). THE USE OF FUNDS Th e primary purpose of taxation is raising revenues to fi nance public expenditure. An analysis of the revenue and burden impacts of a policy is missing the benefi cial impacts stemming from the use of funds and thus ignores the primary purpose of taxation. In cases where policymakers do not specify the use of funds, this is an unavoidable limitation of the analysis, but it remains useful to illustrate why funds are raised and what uses they are put to, and how that in turn aff ects the revenue and burden analyses. Th is section presents welfare analyses of two hypotheticals for each proposal: a spending program that off ers the same benefi t to all adults, and a spending program that off ers benefi ts proportionate to income. For illustrative purposes, spending under both programs is assumed to be lump sum in nature, causing no behavioral changes and generating no benefi ts beyond the pure transfer. As such, these analyses understate the proposal's benefi ts for low- and middle-income families to the extent that public programs are valued above cost.Greg Leiserson 124 TABLE 3. Burden Estimates with Spending Wealth classWealth tax Accrual tax Per capita spendingProportional to income spendingPer capita spendingProportional to income spending Average net transfer change Change in after- tax incomeAverage net transfer change Change in after-tax incomeAverage net transfer change Change in after- tax incomeAverage net transfer change Change rounding of the thresholds for each tax, the revenues raised by the two proposals do not match exactly and thus transfers to low-income families do not match exactly. Table 3 illustrates burden estimates of the dollar-valued gains or losses as a percent of income under each use of funds and for both proposals. Under either assumption about the use of funds, both proposals would deliver meaningful increases in living standards for the overwhelming majority of Americans and would be accompanied by declines in living standards for the wealthiest Americans.Taxing Wealth 125 ASSESSING THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THROUGH THE LENS OF EFFICIENCY An assessment of the proposals in terms of effi ciency amounts to the aggregation of the welfare impact of the proposals (in dollar values) across taxpayers, assuming that revenues are returned to individuals through g o v e r n m e n t s p e n d i n g v a l u e d a t c o s t o r l u m p - s u m t a x r e b a t e s . I n o t h e r words, the effi ciency impact of each proposal is the arithmetic sum of the dollar-value impacts presented in table 3, shown in the row labeled \"All,\" plus compliance costs. 38 Th i s an al y s i s in di ca t e s th a t th e s e p r o p o s al s , w h e n c o m b in e d wi th l um p - sum spending of the resulting funds, are examples of equity-increasing and effi ciency-decreasing policies. Of course, this analysis, like most tax analyses, assumes that the spending has no spillover benefi ts. Were t h e s p e n d i n g t o h a v e s u c h b e n e fi ts, as many public programs do, these proposals could increase both equity and effi ciency (Hendren and Sprung- Keyser 2019). However, just as the traditional distribution analysis must be modifi ed for the analysis of these taxes, this effi ciency analysis also requires modifi cation. N o t a b l y , b o t h t h e r e d u c t i o n s i n b u r d e n a t t r i b u t a b l e t o i n f r a m a r g i n a l benefi ts from tax avoidance and the reduction in burden attributable to reduced costs of avoidance of existing taxes (in cases where these avoidance opportunities are no longer valuable aft er the proposal is implemented) would serve to reduce the costs borne by aff ected taxpayers. Th e increase and acceleration in charitable giving that would result from the proposal would deliver additional benefi ts. 39 Just as the increase in burden shown in tables 1 and 2 above is likely conservative, in the sense of slightly overstating the increase in burden, the reduction in effi ciency implicit in table 3 is also likely conservative, in the sense of slightly overstating the reduction in effi ciency. COMPARING WEALTH-BASED APPROACHES AND INCOME- BASED APPROACHES Wealth taxes and accrual taxation of investment income are similar on many dimensions. Th ey would both raise substantial revenues, overwhelmingly from the wealthiest Americans. And they would both reduce the reliance on realization under the current tax system. Th is section reviews some of the diff erences between the two approaches in more detail. A s p r o p o s e d a b o v e \u2014 a n d c o n s i s t e n t w i t h m o s t p r o p o s a l s i n t h e p u b l i c debate\u2014the wealth tax is an add-on tax that is imposed in addition to the Greg Leiserson 126 income tax, and accrual taxation is a reform to the existing income tax. Although this diff erence is not fundamental to the two approaches, it is responsible for some of the major diff erences in the impacts of the two proposals on the revenue and burden eff ects presented above. Th e wealth tax collects revenues from all assets while the accrual tax collects revenues only from those assets that are taxed relatively more lightly under the existing income tax and only to the extent they are lightly taxed. Th us, adopting an accrual tax would result in little or no tax increase on holders of debt securities and consumer goods such as vehicles and yachts. Debt securities are typically fully taxable, at least when held by taxable investors, and consumer goods generate untaxed consumption and rarely appreciate in price. On the other hand, an accrual tax would result in substantial revenues from publicly traded equities, which are lightly taxed at present, and some revenues from privately held businesses and rental real estate. Th e increase in tax on the latter two classes of assets would be moderated by the fact that they generate income that is already taxed under the income tax. S u p p o s e , f o r e x am p l e , th a t p u b li c l y tr a d e d e q ui ti e s will r e turn 8 p e r c e n t and a work of art will experience 4 percent nominal appreciation while generating a 4 percent return in the form of consumption. Because the value of the work of art refl ects the value of the consumption, a wealth tax will impose the same proportionate tax increase on the two assets, while an accrual tax will impose a larger tax increase on the equities than on the work of art. Th ese diff erences between the wealth tax and accrual tax presented here explain why\u2014to raise the same revenue\u2014the exemption for the accrual tax proposal is smaller than for the wealth tax. At the same time, the more modest increase in rates under an accrual tax is partially responsible for the higher ratio of revenues to aggregate burden under the accrual tax proposal. Of course, alternative policy designs are also possible. An accrual tax proposal combined with an increase in the top marginal income tax rate could raise additional revenues from those at the very top of the income distribution. A lower-rate wealth tax could be applied beginning at a lower wealth threshold to more closely approximate the distribution of the burden under an accrual tax. Because the accrual tax is proposed as a reform to the existing income tax, it allows for more seamless integration with the existing income tax. Under this approach policymakers can align the rates on labor and nonlabor income more closely, which may off er advantages in reducing certain types of avoidance since it is oft en not possible for taxation authorities to perfectly Taxing Wealth 127 distinguish between the two types of income. (However, the need to value businesses independent of the human capital of the owner-employee means this type of issue will remain a challenge under both tax reforms.) Th e fundamental economic diff erence between wealth taxation and accrual taxation is the treatment of risky or uncertain returns. Income taxes adjust in response to higher- or lower-than-expected returns, and thus implicitly share risk between the taxpayer and the government, while wealth taxes do not adjust in response to variation in (contemporaneous) returns. However, to the extent wealth taxes are paid out of wealth\u2014consistent with the assumption made in the estimates presented above\u2014the future wealth tax base would refl ect the history of uncertain past returns. Th is variation in returns could refl ect both general market risk and implicit labor income refl ected in asset values. Guvenen et al. (2019) argue that a wealth tax based on the book value of assets is effi ciency enhancing relative to a capital income tax because it shift s the tax burden from those who use wealth productively to those who use wealth unproductively. In contrast, Kopczuk (2019) argues that accrual taxation would place a relatively greater burden on rents than a wealth tax, and this would be a primary advantage of the accrual taxation approach. One interpretation of the diff erences between these two arguments is that the authors are making diff erent assumptions about the source of excess returns and the responsiveness of those returns to taxation, with correspondingly diff erent implications for the relative merits of the two approaches to taxation. 40 As a result of the diff erent treatment of uncertainty, the income tax approach would generate more volatile tax payments. For the wealthy taxpayers who would be aff ected by taxes like those proposed in this chapter, simple volatility is of relatively little economic importance, given those taxpayers' ready access to fi nancial markets to borrow and lend. However, volatility may have more signifi cant eff ects for the political viability and sustainability of the tax. In addition, to the extent states conform to the federal income tax base, the increased volatility of revenues may have implications for their budgeting processes. Th e wealth tax approach is more naturally applied only to the extremely wealthy through a simple exemption, while accrual taxation requires a more complicated phase in if it is to be limited to the extremely wealthy. Th at said, an exemption from the accrual tax could be structured as an exemption on lifetime or annual gains, which would mitigate this advantage of the wealth tax, although such approaches do not rule out the possibility of a taxpayer of more modest wealth paying the tax.Greg Leiserson 128 Finally, as discussed in greater detail below, the income tax approach would be clearly constitutional whereas the wealth tax approach would face greater risk of being declared unconstitutional. Th ough not an economic distinction between the two approaches, this is potentially the most important diff erence for policymakers. COMPARING VALUATION-BASED APPROACHES AND REALIZATION-BASED APPROACHES Perhaps the most common criticism of wealth taxation and accrual taxation, apart from those criticisms grounded in opposition to increased taxation of the wealthy, is that valuation poses an insurmountable problem. As described above, if valuation is a chief concern, it is possible to impose both a wealth tax and an accrual taxation of investment income on a realization basis. Valuation-based approaches, if successful, provide more accurate income measurement and thus deliver a more robust tax base that is less subject to avoidance and evasion. Realization-based approaches, if successful, reduce the frequency of required valuations and the associated cost without opening the door to excessive rates of avoidance or evasion. Th e choice between the valuation-based approach and the realization-based approach thus depends primarily on the cost of the required valuations, the avoidance under a valuation-based system, the avoidance under a realization-based system, the costs of actions taken to avoid tax under a realization-based system, and the costs of litigation under both systems. Th e realization-based approach avoids the costs of conducting valuations and eliminates the cost of litigation associated with valuation disputes. However, it does so by creating additional opportunities for tax avoidance. In this case, tax avoidance seeks to exploit the diff erences between the values resulting from annual valuations and the pattern of imputed values resulting from a deferral charge. Taxpayers might aim to artifi cially infl ate basis shortly before a non-traded asset is sold to defer the timing of income, for example. Moreover, rules to prevent these types of avoidance would come with their own attendant compliance costs. If the required valuations are expensive and costly to litigate and the realization-based system off ers limited scope for avoidance, the latter would be preferable. If, on the other hand, the realization-based system would result in substantial tax avoidance, especially though not exclusively if the costs of that avoidance are also high, the valuation-based system would be preferable.Taxing Wealth 129 As discussed above, a back-of-the-envelope estimate of the compliance costs of the valuation-based versions of the tax is about 0.2 percent of wealth. Th e realization-based versions potentially could off er lower costs. In evaluating this trade-off , it is important to keep in mind the incidence of the changes. Th e reduction in compliance costs is a benefi t for the taxpayers who would otherwise incur them. Th e reduction in revenue resulting from increased avoidance is borne by the benefi ciaries of the spending that no longer occurs or the taxpayers who bear the burden of other taxes increased to off set the loss. Th us, absent any off setting policy changes, the shift from valuation-based approaches to realization-based approaches almost certainly benefi ts the wealthy, who face lower compliance costs and do not bear the burden of the resulting reduction in spending. If instead top income tax rates are increased to compensate for the potential revenue loss, a key question becomes how the compliance costs for the valuation-based version of the tax compare to the burden imposed by the higher tax rates under the realization-based version. In addition to the core issues around valuations, the choice between valuation and realization raises a couple of more modest issues. First, any hybrid system that applies a realization-based approach to certain assets and a valuation-based approach to other assets would require rules to police this boundary. Second, realization-based systems increase the scope for tax avoidance based on conjectures about future policy changes. Although all policy regimes are temporary, the possibility that a realization-based regime could be repealed, or the tax rates reduced substantially, would create a potentially strong incentive for wealthy taxpayers to hold on to assets under such a regime. Th e proposals described here would apply the tax rate in eff ect in each year to the gains accrued in that year, moderating this impact. However, policymakers could still change this provision itself when enacting future legislation. Questions and Concerns 1. Will illiquid taxpayers be able to pay taxes on wealth? A wealth tax or accrual tax on investment income would require taxpayers to pay tax in years where they may not realize substantial income. However, for taxpayers who are aff ected by the approaches to reform described in this chapter, this is not a signifi cant concern. Th ese approaches apply only to taxpayers with at least $16.5 million in gross assets ($8.25 million for Greg Leiserson 130 single taxpayers) and such taxpayers have ready access to fi nancial markets to fi nance the tax payments. However, were this concern to be judged to be more signifi cant, the realization-based versions of both taxes would align the timing of tax with the realization of income on non-traded assets. In addition, whereas the approaches in this chapter do not provide taxpayers with the opportunity to defer payment of tax with interest, such a provision could be added should policymakers deem it desirable. 41 2. Will volatile asset prices impose too costly a burden under accrual taxation? A related concern is that asset prices are volatile, and thus taxpayers may fi nd themselves with high incomes in certain years and negative incomes in other years under accrual taxation of investment income. If taxpayers are liquidity constrained, they may not be able to manage the resulting swings in tax liabilities. However, the practical relevance of this concern is limited for approaches like those detailed in this chapter that apply only to relatively wealthy taxpayers for the same reason that the liquidity concerns above are limited: Th e aff ected taxpayers generally are not liquidity constrained. To the extent volatile tax liabilities matter, it may be more for the political viability of the tax than for the economic viability. On the other hand, volatile tax collections have the potential to be a more signifi cant concern for state governments to the extent that they conform to the federal income tax base. However, to the extent this is a concern for state governments, they could adopt a smoothing provision either for taxpayers in computing tax payments or in government accounts, such as through increased use of rainy-day funds or inclusion of only a portion of the accrued gains in income each year. 42 3. How does taxing wealth compare to increased taxation of business income at the entity level? Corporate profi ts are an important source of the capital gains and dividends received by individuals. Th us, one alternative to taxing wealth at the investor level would be to increase the taxation of business income at the entity level. In this sense, an increase in the corporate tax rate could be viewed as an alternative way to increase taxes on wealth. Taxing wealth owners has several advantages relative to increased taxation of business income. First, although corporate taxes are highly progressive, targeted investor-level taxes are likely superior in focusing the burden more precisely on the wealthy and limiting the shift ing to other actors, as noted in the discussion of the economic incidence of taxes on savers and fi rms above. Second, addressing tax avoidance strategies at the individual level requires reforms to taxation at that level, such as reforming the taxation Taxing Wealth 131 of wealth as discussed here. Th ird, corporate equity is only one source of capital gains. Capital gains can also arise from pass-through property, real estate, and other assets. Finally, corporate taxes raise their own challenges with avoidance via profi t shift ing (though these could in turn be addressed, at least to some extent, with other reform proposals). Notwithstanding these advantages of investor-level taxation of wealth, there is a strong case for further increasing taxes on business income at the entity level, which could be combined with a shift to cash-fl ow taxation, to limit the extent to which income escapes taxation due to tax preferences at the investor level or because it is attributable to foreign investors. 4. Why not increase estate and gift taxes in lieu of taxing wealth? Th e income tax is the primary source of federal revenues and the major driver of the progressivity of the federal tax system. However, the existing income tax fails to tax the income of the wealthy in an eff ective manner. As outlined in this chapter, taxing wealth through either a wealth tax or accrual taxation of investment income serves to address the limitations of the existing income tax, strengthening the income tax base. Reforms to estate and gift taxes could raise substantial revenues from a similarly wealthy population\u2014and are merited in their own right\u2014but they would not substitute for an eff ort to strengthen the income tax base. 5. Should the income tax be indexed for infl ation under the accrual tax? Th ough many provisions of the income tax, such as the tax brackets, are adjusted annually for infl ation, the tax code makes no attempt to adjust the measurement of capital income for infl ation. As a result, the capital income t a x b a s e i s n o m i n a l i n c o m e r a t h e r t h a n r e a l i n c o m e . I n p r i n c i p l e , r e a l income provides a superior measure of ability to pay. However, the technical challenges of comprehensively adjusting income fl ows for infl ation across the entire tax code have traditionally discouraged any attempt to implement such adjustments. As long as infl ation remains low, the potential benefi ts of adjusting the tax code for infl ation are modest. Such adjustment would reduce tax rates on investment income and potentially reallocate tax burdens from borrowers to lenders. However, especially under the approaches to reform set forth here, which apply only to the tail of the wealth distribution, indexing investment gains would be a costly, regressive tax cut (absent other off setting policy changes). Th ere is li ttle reaso n to in cur signifi cant fi scal costs for that purpose.Greg Leiserson 132 6. What constitutional issues are raised by taxing wealth? Th e U.S. Constitution grants to Congress a broad taxing power. It also requires that direct taxes be apportioned according to population, meaning t h a t t h e r e v e n u e s c o l l e c t e d f r o m e a c h s t a t e m u s t b e p r o p o r t i o n a l t o t h e po p ula ti o n o f tha t sta te. H o w ev er , th e Co nsti tu ti o n d oes n o t i tself defi ne what a direct tax is. Famously, during the Constitutional Convention a delegate asked what the precise meaning of direct taxation was, and no one answered (Ackerman 1999). In 1895 the Supreme Court declared the United States' second federal income tax to be unconstitutional as an unapportioned direct tax. Th e country's fi rst federal income tax had been upheld 15 years earlier, though the legal i s s u e s r a i s e d i n t h a t c a s e h a d b e e n s o m e w h a t d i ff erent. Subsequently, Congress passed, and the states ratifi ed, the 16th Amendment, granting Congress the power to create an income tax. If enacted, a federal wealth tax would certainly be challenged in the courts as an unapportioned direct tax. Among other arguments, opponents of a wealth tax would likely argue that a tax on real property is a direct tax and thus a tax on wealth is a direct tax because it embeds a tax on real property. Proponents would argue that a wealth tax is not a direct tax and, potentially, that a wealth tax is an income tax (the motivation for the proposal in this chapter). Th ere is case law that both proponents and opponents could point to as supporting their view, and the resolution of such a case would likely depend on the makeup of the Court at the time the case is heard. M a r k - t o - m a r k e t t a x a t i o n w o u l d l i k e w i s e a l m o s t c e r t a i n l y b e c h a l l e n g e d before the Supreme Court, but the case for constitutionality here is unambiguous (Miller 2016b). Th e 16th Amendment gave Congress the power to tax incomes, and a mark-to-market income tax is clearly a tax on incomes. Indeed, provisions for mark-to-market taxation already exist in the Internal Revenue Code in a variety of places, including Section 475 (for securities dealers), Section 1256 (for certain types of fi nancial contracts), Section 877A (for certain expatriates), and Sections 1272 and 1273 (original issue discount for debt securities), among others. Arguments for the unconstitutionality of mark-to-market taxation typically assert that realization is a constitutional requirement, not merely an administrative convenience. Th e Supreme Court upheld this reasoning in a 1920 decision (Eisner v. Macomber), ruling that a stock dividend in which the taxpayer did not receive cash was not income under the 16th Amendment. However, the Court has contradicted or limited this reasoning in subsequent cases at least four times (Miller 2016b) and has never applied it to any existing provision of the tax code that imposes accrual taxation.Taxing Wealth 133 Conclusion T o keep past promises and fi nance new spending that meets the needs of the moment, the federal government will eventually need to collect more revenue. In light of high and rising inequality in both income and wealth, as well as the structural weaknesses of the tax system as it applies to the wealthy today, reforms to the taxation of wealth are a natural part of the solution. Four approaches to taxing wealth could all raise substantial sums from the wealthiest Americans: an annual wealth tax, a realization-based wealth tax, accrual taxation, and accrual taxation of publicly traded assets combined with realization-based taxation of non-traded assets. Appendix A. Taxation of Wealth and Investment Income Today Understanding how wealth and investment income are taxed requires an understanding of the legal forms used to conduct business in the United States. Business activity is generally conducted in one of two forms: a traditional C corporation or a pass-through business, such as an S corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship. Traditional C corporations are responsible for paying an entity-level corporate income tax at a rate of 21 percent. Corporate taxable income consists of business receipts and investment income less the cost of goods, current expenses, interest payments, and depreciation of capital investments. Dividends paid by C corporations are subject to investor-level dividend taxes, generally at preferential rates of 0, 15, or 20 percent ( depending on income level). Dividends not eligible for these preferential rates are taxed according to the ordinary rate schedule, up to a maximum of 37 percent. In addition, dividends are also subject to the net investment income tax of 3.8 percent for married taxpayers with incomes above $250,000 ($200,000 for single taxpayers). Although the income of C corporations is potentially subject to tax at both the entity level and the investor level, empirical estimates suggest that double taxation is more the exception than the norm, and income is likely taxed less than once in many cases. Only about one-quarter of corporate stock is held by taxable investors (Burman, Clausing, and Austin 2017; Rosenthal and Austin 2016). Tax-exempt investors include pension funds, nonprofi ts, and foreign investors. Moreover, about 40 percent of corporate investment is debt-fi nanced, which largely escapes taxation at the entity level. Finally, Greg Leiserson 134 b u s i n e s s e s h a v e b e e n a b l e t o d e d u c t 5 0 p e r c e n t o r m o r e o f t h e v a l u e o f equipment investment since 2008 and are able to deduct 100 percent of the value of equipment investment placed in service aft er September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. Pass-through businesses are not subject to an entity-level tax. Instead, the items of income, gain, deduction, and credit are passed through to the owners, who include those items on their individual income tax returns. Th ese items are taxed under the same rules that apply to other sources of income, subject to certain exceptions, and thus are subject to progressive tax rates up to a maximum of 37 percent in the case of ordinary income. Capital gains and dividend income received by a pass-through business are passed through to the owner and taxed at the preferential rates that would apply had those forms of income been received by the taxpayers themselves. Income from a pass-through business may be subject to the net investment income tax of 3.8 percent. In addition, income from a pass-through business may be eligible for a deduction of up to 20 percent that reduces the top income tax rate to 29.6 percent (33.4 percent including the net investment income tax). In contrast to C corporations, distributions from pass-through businesses are generally exempt from tax. S corporation shareholders' and partners' basis increases in accordance with income passed through from the business and decreases with distributions from the business. Th ese adjustments in basis prevent double taxation of income retained in the pass-through business when a pass-through business is sold. C corporations and S corporations are required to pay reasonable compensation to employee owners, whereas owners of other types of pass-through businesses are not required to distinguish between labor income and capital income. Profi ts from these types of businesses thus refl ect a mix of both labor and capital income. Historically, C corporations accounted for the vast majority of business activity, but pass-throughs have grown markedly since the early 1980s and now account for 40 percent of all business receipts (appendix fi gure A1). As noted above, businesses may deduct interest paid from their taxable income. Individuals pay tax on interest income at ordinary tax rates, up to a maximum of 37 percent plus the net investment income tax of 3.8 percent. Taxpayers who own debt securities that do not pay interest on an annual basis but pay implicit interest (because their price is less than face value) must include imputed interest in their income each year.Taxing Wealth 135 Owners of any asset, whether stock in a C or S corporation, a partnership interest, personal use property, or otherwise, are potentially subject to capital gains taxes when they sell the asset. Th e capital gain is the excess of the sales proceeds over the basis. Th e basis of an asset is the purchase price adjusted for certain subsequent transactions, such as further investments in the asset. Long-term capital gains, defi ned as gains resulting from assets held for more than one year, are typically subject to preferential rates of 0, 15, or 20 percent (depending on income level). Short-term capital gains, defi ned as gains on assets held for one year or less, are taxed at ordinary rates. Capital gains are also subject to the 3.8 percent net investment income tax for taxpayers with incomes above $250,000 ($200,000 for single taxpayers). As noted above, a capital gain is said to be realized when the asset is sold. Th us, capital gains are said to be taxed on a realization basis. 43 Th e tax code off ers an array of preferences for investment income. Employer retirement plans and individual retirement accounts provide taxpayers with the opportunity to avoid paying tax on their investment income. Retirement accounts are one of two types: traditional or Roth. In a traditional account, taxpayers receive a deduction for contributions, pay no tax on accruing income within the account, and pay tax at ordinary rates on distributions. In a Roth account, taxpayers receive no deduction for contributions and pay no tax on both income accruing within the account and distributions. APPENDIX FIGURE A1.

Taxpayers pay no tax on imputed rent (i.e., the rent the taxpayer would have received had they rented out the house rather than live in it themselves) but may deduct mortgage interest. Taxpayers may also exclude the fi rst $500,000 of capital gains on the sale of a primary residence ($250,000 for single individuals). Unrealized capital gains on assets held by a taxpayer at death are exempt from tax under the provision for step-up in basis at death. Under this provision, the basis of a taxpayer's assets is increased, or stepped up, to the market value at the time of death thus exempting such gains from income taxation. Heirs then pay tax only on gains that occur aft er the step-up in basis. Prior gains are wiped out for purposes of the income tax. Owners of real estate may also swap one real-estate asset for another in what is known as a like-kind exchange. If this transaction meets certain restrictions, the swap is not treated as a sale and thus it does not result in capital gains taxes. Appendix B. Methodology for Revenue Estimates Estimates of the revenue raised by reforms to the taxation of wealth rely on estimates of the value of wealth, the value of unrealized appreciation on investment assets, and the behavioral responses to the proposed reforms. 44 Th e United States does not presently have a wealth tax, so there is no existing administrative assessment of wealth. Estimates of wealth generally rely on one of three methods: survey data on wealth, inferences about wealth from estate tax data, and inferences about wealth from income tax data (Batchelder and Kamin 2019; Zucman 2019). Th e estimates presented here rely on the Survey of Consumer Finances (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System [Federal Reserve Board] 2016), augmented with information from the 2018 Forbes 400. 45 In estimating wealth tax revenues, I fi rst reduce the value of private business w e a l t h b y 1 6 p e r c e n t a s a n e s t i m a t e o f t a x e v a s i o n b a s e d o n e s t i m a t e d evasion rates under the income tax for the income of S corporations and partnerships (Dubois et al. 2016). To refl ect tax avoidance, I further reduce the value of all wealth (including the already reduced private business wealth) by 16 percent. Th is estimate refl ects an underlying assumed semi-elasticity of avoidance of 8 percent with respect to the wealth tax rate. Th is estimate of avoidance includes responses such as charitable giving, expatriation, increased consumption spending, and any form of legal tax planning. 46Taxing Wealth 137 I assume both the wealth tax and private compliance costs of the wealth tax are paid out of wealth. Although limited evidence is available on the consumption spending of the very wealthy, the evidence that does exist suggests the ratio of consumption spending to wealth is small (Fisher et al. 2018). Th e assumption that the tax is paid entirely out of wealth would be slightly conservative\u2014in the sense that it underestimates tax revenues\u2014relative to an assumption that a portion was paid out of consumption spending. Th e assumption that the tax is paid out of wealth not only has a direct eff ect on future wealth tax liabilities, but also reduces future income tax liabilities resulting from current-law taxes on investment income. I compute revenue estimates for the 2021-30 period using the revenue estimates for 2021 and a simplifi ed off -model calculation rather than an explicit panel tax model. I infl ate the net-of-avoidance 2021 wealth tax revenues by a factor of 11.9, refl ecting a baseline wealth growth rate of 6 percent reduced by the 2 percent wealth tax rate and the 0.2 percent ratio of compliance costs to wealth, compounded over nine years. 47 I then subtract an income tax off set equal to 0.70 times 2021 revenues refl ecting erosion of the income tax base due to the wealth tax payments and to compliance costs. 48 Under these assumptions, the absolute wealth of the aff ected population would continue to grow without limit. However, as a share of baseline wealth, it would decrease geometrically. In part, this refl ects the absence of any churn in the aff ected population, including the absence of any explicit role for mortality, savings, or entrepreneurship in the evolution of wealth. Th e exclusion of these factors would likely result in a modest understatement of revenues in the fi rst decade. Th ese factors would be essential in the development of longer-term revenue estimates. Estimates of the revenue raised from accrual taxation rely on the same estimates of wealth. Th is analysis focuses on three types of assets that likely account for the majority of potential revenues under such an approach: (1) publicly traded equities, (2) private business, and (3) real estate. Publicly traded equities are assumed to return 8 percent. Private businesses are assumed to generate nominal capital gains of about 3 percent. Th is capital gain is in addition to the ordinary income that fl ows through to the owner on schedules C, E, and F on the tax return. Th e return assumption is based on the nominal gains on real estate assets held by nonfi nancial noncorporate businesses in the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts. Finally, directly held real estate assets are assumed to generate nominal capital gains of 3.8 percent based on the rate of return on household real estate holdings in the Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts.Greg Leiserson 138 As under the wealth tax, I reduce mark-to-market incomes to refl ect evasion and avoidance. I reduce the estimate of accrual income from p r i v a t e b u s i n e s s e s b y 1 6 p e r c e n t t o a c c o u n t f o r e v a s i o n , p a r a l l e l t o t h e reduction in private business wealth under the wealth tax. I then reduce the three sources of accruing investment income (corporate equities, private businesses, and real estate) by between 8 and 18 percent. To achieve greater internal consistency between the wealth tax and accrual taxation revenue estimates, I compute a wealth-tax-equivalent rate for the accrual tax for each of the three covered asset types and apply the same 8 percent semi-elasticity of avoidance used for the wealth tax estimate. 49 Based on the assumed levels of wealth and income, income tax revenues are calculated using the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Internet TAXSIM model (NBER 2019). I convert the 2021 revenue estimate for the accrual tax to an estimate of revenues for the 2021-30 period using the same methods used for the wealth tax above. As with the wealth tax, I assume that the increased tax liabilities and compliance costs are paid out of wealth, and that these reductions in future wealth have a corresponding eff ect on income tax revenues. 50 Th ese revenue estimates are intended to correspond to conventional revenue estimates in the sense of the term used by the congressional JCT. Conventional revenue estimates are estimated under an assumption that GNP does not change. Conventional revenue estimates thus refl ect avoidance and evasion responses that cause income to shift across tax bases or outside the tax base entirely, but do not refl ect responses that cause total income to change and, through that channel, cause the tax base to change. Under a fi xed GNP approach, any reduction in capital income among those aff ected by the wealth tax or the accrual tax must be off set by an increase in capital income among those unaff ected by the proposals. Because this in co m e w o ul d, a t l east po ten tially , be sub ject to in co m e taxes, this co ul d reduce the revenue losses attributable to avoidance in a conventional revenue estimate. However, the revenue estimates above do not include an estimate of this potential off setting eff ect motivated by the evidence suggesting that the majority of C corporation equity is held by tax -exempt investors, and thus that the average eff ective tax rate on capital at the investor-level is low (Burman, Clausing, and Austin 2017; Rosenthal and Austin 2016). 51 Dynamic revenue estimates relax the assumption that GNP is unchanged. However, there would be little diff erence between the conventional revenue estimates presented above and a dynamic revenue estimate. To the extent foreign investors would become a more important source of fi nancing for domestic investment under these proposals, analysis under the fi xed Taxing Wealth 139 GNP assumption might overstate the increase in capital income received by domestic investors that results from these reforms and understate the increase in capital income by foreign investors. However, since the estimate above assumed the increase in capital income received by domestic investors was unaff ected by the wealth tax and the accrual tax generated no additional revenues, any shift from domestic investors to foreign investors would have no eff ect on the estimate. 52 Th e mark-to-market system would raise additional transitional revenues from the realization of pre-enactment gains when assets are sold and from repealing stepped-up basis for past gains. Th ese transitional revenues are excluded from the revenue estimates in the eff ort to put the wealth tax approaches and the income tax approaches on an even footing. Finally, the revenue estimates for the accrual proposal exclude the cost of the dividend imputation credit and some of the more narrowly targeted provisions, such as the limitation on retirement account balances, the eff ects of which would be modest relative to the overall revenue impact. SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY Th e estimates presented above are highly uncertain. Th e value of wealth, the value of unrealized appreciation on investment assets, and the behavioral responses to the proposed taxes are all subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, this chapter relies on the publicly available Survey of Consumer Finances (Federal Reserve Board 2016), which provides a high-quality and internally consistent set of income and wealth information for U.S. households. Ho wever , this data diff ers in some respects from the income data collected in the administration of the income tax. An additional source of uncertainty in the revenue estimates is the potential for asset price eff ects resulting from the increased taxation of wealth. To the extent that the marginal investor is subject to higher taxes on their asset holdings, their willingness to pay for an asset may fall. In addition, taxpayers who are subject to the tax would have reduced demand for asset holdings resulting from their direct tax payments and, potentially, from their avoidance strategies depending on what those avoidance strategies are. (Assets shift ed from a taxable investor to an exempt foundation would not necessarily reduce overall asset demand, whereas assets sold to fi nance increased consumption spending would.) A decline in asset prices would have diff erent impacts on the wealth taxes and the accrual taxes. Since the wealth taxes are based on asset values, a decline in assets prices would reduce revenues. However, since the accrual taxes are based on the return, a decline in asset prices associated with Greg Leiserson 140 higher returns (to off set taxes) would result in increased revenues. Th e benchmark estimates above assume no immediate asset price eff ects since the proposal applies to only a small portion of domestic investors. Th is decision to assume no asset price eff ects could overstate wealth tax revenues and understate accrual taxation revenues. An additional set of uncertainties in the revenue estimates is those that relate to the more nuanced diff erences in the potential for avoidance and evasion under a wealth tax and an accrual tax. At present, this analysis assumes that avoidance under the two systems is broadly similar. Indeed, one contribution of this analysis lies in the attempt to generate internally consistent estimates of the revenues that would result from a wealth tax and accrual taxation of investment income. However, there are some important reasons that the two regimes might be diff erent. First, and perhaps most importantly, the wealth tax does not vary with variation in investment returns whereas the income tax owed under accrual taxation of investment income does. In other words, under the accrual tax the taxpayer and the government share investment risk, and under the wealth tax the taxpayer bears all of the risk. Th us, for a given expected tax payment, the cost of the wealth tax payment may exceed the cost of the income tax payment. As a result, taxpayers' wealth holdings may be more sensitive to a given level of payments under the wealth tax than under the income tax. Th is diff erence might aff ect not just investors' portfolio and savings decisions, but also labor supply and other decisions like those relevant for the taxation of rents under the two systems. Second, although the principles underlying the determination of tax liabilities in an accrual tax and a wealth tax are similar in many respects\u2014including relying on valuations of potentially hard-to-value assets\u2014the computation of tax would be quite diff erent. Notably, a portion of the income accruing to pass-through owners under the income tax would remain a measure of profi ts as under current law. Only a residual would be taxed as a change in market values, refl ecting changes in expectations of future profi ts and unrealized capital gains held by the pass-through entity. Th e continued reliance on income to impose tax may facilitate higher compliance. Th ird, under the accrual proposals taxpayers who earn no return on their assets will p a y n o tax. Th is raises the possibility that taxpayers, even for what is economically a similar tax, will be more inclined to retain assets in their possession than to shift them into tax-preferred entities, such as a nonprofi t or a relative in a lower tax bracket.Taxing Wealth 141 REVENUE ESTIMATES FOR THE REALIZATION-BASED WEALTH AND ACCRUAL TAXES Separate estimates of the revenues raised by the realization-based versions of each tax are not presented in this chapter due to the limited evidence o n w h i c h t o b a s e a n e s t i m a t e o f t h e d i ff erences between the valuation- based approaches and the realization-based approaches. Th e primary consideration in estimating the diff erence in the revenues raised under the valuation-based approaches and under the realization-based approaches is the diff erential ability to avoid tax under the two. To the extent the realization-based approaches allow taxpayers to exploit the precise structure of the deferred tax computation to avoid tax, these approaches could raise less revenue. To the extent they would reduce the scope for taxpayers to understate asset values or gains and thus avoid tax, they would increase revenues.

Th roughout this chapter, maximum tax rates include the 3.8 percent additional Medicare tax and the 3.8 percent net investment income tax when appropriate. 2. Th e estimates presented here rely on the Survey of Consumer Finances (Federal Reserve Board 2016) and thus report the distribution by househol ds rather than by tax units. An analysis by tax units, as is standard in tax analysis, would show each proposal to be more concentrated among the wealthiest and highest-income families since there are more low-income tax units than there are low-income households. 3. Proposals for wealth taxes have been set out by Shakow and Shuldiner (2000), Piketty (2014), Shakow (2016), and Saez and Zucman (2019), among others. Proposals for accrual taxation, some of which rely on realization and some of which do not, include Shakow (1986), Glogower (2016), Grubert and Altshuler (2016), and Miller (2016a). Auerbach (1991) proposes retrospective taxation of capital gains, though, in the terminology of this chapter, his proposal is more closely related to the realization-based wealth tax than it is to the realization-based accrual tax. Batchelder and Kamin (2019) provide a recent review of proposals to tax high-income and high-wealth households. 4. A like-kind exchange allows a taxpayer to exclude from income the gain on the sale of the asset that would otherwise be taxable. Th e taxpayer's basis in the newly acquired asset is set equal to their basis in the original asset. Th e provision therefore allows a deferral of tax but not an exemption from tax unless it is combined with other planning strategies. 5. Th e revenue estimate for the Obama administration's proposal to tax gains at death was only about $200 billion (Treasury 2016). However, in large part this diff erence refl ects a lag in the timing of Greg Leiserson 142 revenues collected under this proposal following enactment, though it also refl ects a shift in the budget window, a modest exemption, and some avoidance through charitable giving, because gains on assets donated to charitable organizations would not have been taxed under the proposal. Since the shortfall in revenues relative to the tax expend iture is substantially due to timing, the revenue estimate would rise closer to the tax expenditure estimate in later years. 6. A modest but noticeable fraction of the revenues raised by this package of incremental options would come from families with incomes outside the top 5 percent of families. To the extent that policymakers exempt these families (or even more families) from the incremental reform packages, the revenues raised would be further reduced. 7. Additional gift taxes on high-income taxpayers who are not subject to the wealth tax may be appropriate to discourage taxpayers who anticipate paying the wealth tax in future years from giving during the years just before they would otherwise become subject to the tax. Th ese taxes should be based on information collected on current income and gift tax returns. 8. In the case of dependents who could potentiall y be claimed by multiple taxpayers, the dependent would be assigned to the return with the highest taxable wealth. In addition, if a dependent's wealth exceeds $1 million, that dependent's support (including cumulative gift s and inheritances) comes from another tax unit, and that tax unit has hig her wealth, then the dependent would be included in that tax unit for wealth tax purposes. 9. Th e federal income tax applies to all resident aliens. Th e proposed wealth tax applies to a somewhat narrower base to avoid imposing the compliance costs associated with valuations on taxpayers whose wealth has been accumulated outside the United States and who would not be subject to the tax on an ongoing basis. 10. Defi ned benefi t pension entitlements would be valued ba sed on actuarial assumptions prescribed by the Treasury and IRS. Funded status would not be considered in determining the value of pension entitlements. 11. Th e fair market value of the interest would be computed using discount rates that reasonably refl ect any risk of nonpayment for future payments. 12. See Dodge (2016) for an alternative approach that seeks to address some of the same underlying issues. 13. Pension entitlements would be included in the wealth tax base as assets of the participant or benefi ciary as noted above. 14. See Galle (2019) for additional discussion of the treatment of nonprofi ts under a wealth tax. 15. No allowance for consumption would be provided. Th e assumed infl ationary rate of return and the absence of allowance for consumption together aim to balance the goal of taxing wealth owners on the present value of their wealth at the time they expatriate. Th e Treasury and the IRS would prescribe the mortality assumptions. 16. In the case of a business with substantially identical ownership s takes, such as an S corporation with a single class of stock or a C corporation with a limited number of classes of stock, these valuations may be expressed in terms of the value of each class of stock. 17. Business entities required to fi le an information return would be required to disclose to the IRS if they receive an information return from a subsidi ary that is substantiall y inconsistent with the valuation that they report to the IRS. Th is requirement would not apply to publicly traded entities who receive such inconsistent returns. 18. Th is realization-based wealth tax is motivated by the proposal for retrospective capital income taxes of Auerbach (1991). In the spirit of that proposal, the proposed approach depends on an assumed return rather than on the observed return, and the tax depends on the holding period. In contrast to the Auerbach proposal, it is a tax based on wealth rather than income. If the wealth tax rate is set equal to the income tax rate multiplied by the assu med return, this proposal would be equivalent to one formulation of the retrospective income tax proposal. 19. For purposes of computing this realization-based wealth tax liability, a taxpayer would be treated as if they held the asset for the entire year if they held the asset on the da te at which it would have been valued for wealth tax purposes according to their accounting methods. In other words, if a taxpayer invests in a non-traded asset on December 1 and the asset would be valued on December 31, they would be treated as having held the non-traded asset for the entire year. 20. An important design challenge for the realization-based wealth tax is the determination of the Taxing Wealth 143 holding period for self-created assets. One potential approach would be to value the labor invested in creating such assets and use the value of those investments to create a series of notional assets with diff erent holding periods. Further development of the rules specifi c to the case of self-created assets is an important area for additional work. (A similar challenge applies to the realization-based accrual tax.) 21. Note, however, that this challenge is not entirely new to the tax code. Determining reasonable compensation for C and S corporation owners under the existing income tax poses a related challenge, albeit one with much lower stakes. 22. Th is defi nition is motivated by the defi nition proposed in Miller (2005) and is intended to follow the same general idea, recognizing that the refe renced regulations were substantially modifi ed in the interim. 23. An alternative approach would exempt a specifi c quantity of lifetime gains, rather than rely on asset thresholds. Th e lifetime exemption approach avoids the need to value assets and eliminates the possibility that taxpayers would enter and exit the mark-to-market regime multiple times but does not guarantee an asset level below which taxpayers are not subject to the tax. 24. Additional rules to deal with publicly traded companies in which a dominant set of shareholders or owner-employees own a substantial majority of shares may be appropriate. 25. Sole proprietors (and owners of other disregarded entities) could elect to mark all assets and liabilities of the sole proprietorship to market rather than treat the sole proprietorship itself as an asset. Arguably, a proposal like this one amounts to a new concept of what an entity is for tax purposes. Further refi nement of this concept would be a valuable area for additional work. 26. In principle, it would be desirable to limit the exclusion of post-transition gains from income to the quantity of appreciation previously included in income. However, doing so would create challenges in tracking these inclusions across owners. 27. Outside basis would adjust according to the sum of pass-through income and the net appreciation of the ownership interest. 28. Th e tax rate applied to pass-through income and th e net appreciation of the pass-through interest would be the same, but taxpayers might still seek to convert income from the former form to the latter if it is easier to understate the latter form of income. 29. Current law rules for the depreciation of business-use property would continue to apply for businesses that are not required to use mark-to-market accounting (i.e., nonfi nancial businesses). For a business fi nanced entirely with equity and that is owned exclusively by investors subject to the accrual system, the accrual proposal would eff ectively repeal accelerated depreciation. Th is would occur even though accelerated depreciation would remain in eff ect for purposes of computing the business' taxable income. Accelerated depreciation would remain economically relevant for businesses with a more diverse ownership base and for businesses in which entity-level decision- making does not fully incorporate investor-level incentives. 30. Outside basis would adjust in accordance with pas s-through income and realized gains on sales from assets held by the pass-through entity. Th e deferral charge itself would not aff ect outside basis. Inside basis could be adjusted for changes in outside basis under procedures modeled on those of Section 754. Additional refi nement of the procedures for aligning inside basis and outside basis would be a valuable area for future work. Since distributions to pass-through owners reduce the owners' basis, there is not the same need for an additional tax on distributions under the realization- based accrual tax to reduce the incentive for taxpayer s to use distributions to reduce the value of a non-traded asset shortly before sale as there is under the realization-based wealth tax. 31. An alternative to the hybrid approach under which certain assets are taxed annually on a mark- to-market basis and other assets are taxed when sold with a deferral charge is a uniform system in which all taxes are imposed when assets ar e sold. Glogower (2016) outlines such a system. An advantage of this approach is that it e liminates any inconsistencies in the treatment of diff erent assets. A disadvantage is that it increases the se nsitivity of taxes to legislative changes and thus increases the option value of deferral. 32. Th e revenue estimates presented here rely on the National Bureau of Economic Research's (NBER) taxsim27 program (NBER 2019), and thus implicitly assume 199A has been repealed. Impacts are measured relative to current policy (i.e ., they assumed the 2017 tax cuts have been made permanent). Estimates are on a calendar year basis. Fi scal year estimates would be slightly lower. Greg Leiserson 144 Th e estimates also exclude some of the more narrowly targeted provisions, such as the limitation on retirement account balances under the accrual taxation approaches, the eff ects of which would be modest relative to the overall revenue impact. 33. Th e distribution analysis presented here relies on the Survey of Consumer Finances (Federal Reserve Board 2016) and thus reports the distribution by households rather than tax units. An analysis by tax units, as is standard in tax analysis, would show each proposal to be more concentrated among the wealthiest and highest-income families since th ere are more low-income tax units than low- income households. 34. JCT (1993) developed this approach to distribu tion analysis in detail but has subsequently moved away from it in its offi cial work. 35. Were revenues used for defi cit reduction rather than spent, the increase in government savings could also substitute for wealth previously held by the wealthy. 36. A portion of the reduction in wealth resulting from the proposed taxes on wealth refl ects the mechanical eff ect of increased tax payments. Th is reduction in wealth would be appropriately excluded from a traditional distribution analysis as well as the modifi ed distribution analysis described here. 37. I assume these costs are not explicitly deductib le under either the wealth tax or the accrual tax. However, they would be eff ectively deductible with a one-yea r lag since the costs incurred in one calendar year to pay the prior year's wealth tax would reduce wealth or investment income when the subsequent year's tax liability is determined, cons istent with the assumption above that the tax liabilities are paid out of wealth. Th is eff ect is refl ected in the estimates of revenue and burden above. 38. Notably, under the assumption that the spending is valued dollar for dollar, this aggregation means the assumption about the use of funds is unimportant. 39. See Chetty (2009) for a discussion of related issues. 40. Relatedly, as noted above, the wealth tax is be tter able to tax income generated by wealth in the form of services, such as the housing services provided by owner-occupied real estate and the enjoyment provided by works of art, yachts, and the like. 41. A similar provision for the deferral of tax payments exists un der the estate tax. 42. As part of their proposal for mark-to-market taxation of publicly traded C corporation securities, Toder and Viard (2016) propose a smoothing mechanism that would include 20 percent of the cumulative quantity of accrued gains and losses each year. 43. Owners of business-use property are subject to tax if they dispose of that property at a gain. A complex set of rules determines whether the gains are subject to ordinary tax rates, the preferential capital gains tax rates noted above, or alternative tax rates. 44. For additional discussion of the revenue potential of a wealth tax in the United States see Saez and Zucman (2019) and Ricco, He, and Huntley (2019). 45. Incomes for the Forbes 400 are imputed u sing the estimates of Bourne et al. (2018). 46. I assume that half of this avoidance erodes the income tax base, as in the case of charitable contributions and expatriation, and half of this avoidance does not, as in the case of a transfer to another taxpayer in the top income tax bracket to whom the wealth tax does not apply. Th is estimate assumes that avoidance occurs immediately and is constant over time. To the extent that it takes time to develop or implement new planning strategies or to take advantage of avoidance opportunities, it may be that avoidance increases over time. 47. Among other factors, this calculation implicitl y ignores the wealth tax threshold, which would likely cause the resulting estimate to slightly understate revenues, provided the threshold grows relatively slowly, such as if indexed to infl ation. 48. I ignore the potential for an off set refl ecting the increase in wealth from the reduction of income tax liabilities paid in the baseline and the potential for an off set of estate tax revenues. Th e former would likely cause the estimate presented here to slig htly understate revenues and the latter to slightly overstate revenues. 49. For purposes of computing the phase in, I assume that private business wealth is reduced by the 16 percent evasion adjustment and the resulting value of net worth understated by an additional 8 percent. 50. Th is adjustment is arguably nonstandard in the analysis of changes in the taxation of capital gains.

One alternative approach to constructing conventional revenue estimates assumes that any change in tax results in a change in consumption. Under this approach, the wealth tax payments and compliance costs would not reduce future wealth, and thus the revenue estimate would be higher than the estimate presented here. 52. To the extent that revenues from taxes on wealth and investment income were not spent but instead were used to reduce the defi cit, this could generate a small positive impact on revenues from reduced crowd out. However, for the present purposes I assume the revenue is spent. Greg Leiserson 146 Dowd, Tim, Robert McClelland, and Jacob A. Mortenson. 2019.

An FTT\u2014if carefully designed and implemented\u2014would raise substantial revenues in a progressive manner. We propose an FTT of 10 basis points that would apply to trading in stocks, bonds, and derivatives. We do not believe an FTT at this level would hinder market functioning or impede price discovery, and in fact it would be less than the recent declines in transaction costs that have occurred in many markets. Th e Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that the proposal would raise approximately $60 billion in annual revenue once it is fully phased in. Because the United States does not have r e c e n t e x p e r i e n c e w i t h a n o n t r i v i a l F T T , s o m e a s p e c t s o f i t s e ff ects\u2014 including the precise amount of revenue that would be raised\u2014remain uncertain. For this reason, we propose a staged implementation over four years, with the FTT starting at 2 basis points, to allow policymakers to monitor market functioning, address avoidance techniques that will undoubtedly arise, and, if necessary, more carefully calibrate the level of the tax. Introduction No single tax instrument, by itself, can effi ciently and fairly raise the funds needed to provide public services at diff erent points throughout the business cycle. Our tax system refl ects this reality, relying on a mixture of taxes that have diff erent behavioral impacts, economic incidences, and eff ects on economic output. Relying on a diversity of taxes is more likely to minimize the effi ciency costs of raising a given amount of revenue, while broadly distributing the burden of taxation among those with the means to pay. In addition, addressing the current gap between government revenues A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions Antonio Weiss, Harvard Kennedy School Laura Kawano, University of MichiganAntonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 150 and outlays needed for vital programs will likely require a number of incremental tax measures. In this spirit, we propose a tax instrument that is not currently used to any signifi cant degree by the United States: a fi nancial transaction tax (FTT). An FTT\u2014if carefully designed and implemented\u2014would raise substantial revenue in a progressive manner. We do not believe an FTT at the level we propose would hinder market functioning or impede price discovery. In addition, some of the fi nancial activity it would discourage, including some high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading, may provide limited marginal economic benefi t to the country as a whole. Like all taxes, an FTT would have associated effi ciency costs. Th e potential amount of revenue raised and the magnitude of an FTT's associated deadweight losses depend crucially on the size of the tax, the responsiveness of market participants to the new tax, and the economic value of any lost activity, which we address below. While critics oft en suggest that an FTT would have dramatic adverse eff ects on asset prices, the cost of capital, and fi nancial market functioning, these arguments appear overstated when placed in the context of total transaction costs and prior changes in the tax code. Th e FTT we propose would be smaller than the decline in transaction costs that has occurred in recent years in many markets. Opponents of an FTT argue that even small increases in transaction costs will signifi cantly increase the cost of capital, but there is a lack of convincing empirical evidence that the recent reduction in transaction costs has had the opposite eff ect. Moreover, U.S. fi nancial markets have functioned well through a variety of changes to relevant tax policies, 1 and it is unclear whether a small FTT would be any more signifi cant. While we believe the merits of an FTT are compelling, we do not want to overstate what it would accomplish. For example, there is no strong evidence that an FTT would reduce fi nancial market risks or the probability of future asset price bubbles. An FTT is also unlikely to signifi cantly increase investors' long-term focus. While it would reduce some high-velocity, short-term trading strategies, we do not expect a small fee to be suffi cient to motivate end investors to adopt a longer-run perspective. Additionally, although an FTT would be progressive, the tax burden would not exclusively fall on the fi nancial sector or the wealthiest households. A small portion of the FTT would fall on those in the middle of the income distribution, either through trades they make directly or through funds in which they invest. Lastly, some advocates suggest that an FTT could raise exorbitant amounts of tax revenue that are unlikely to be achieved. Rather, we suggest that an FTT could prove a useful component of a more comprehensive tax program. A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 151 Th e FTT we propose would be phased in over four years, starting at 2 basis points (0.02 percent) and increasing annually until it reaches a target rate of 10 basis points, and it would apply to trading in stocks, bonds, and derivatives. 2 According to revenue and distributional estimates of our proposed FTT by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC), it would raise annual revenue of approximately $60 billion once fully phased in, with cumulative estimated revenue in excess of $500 billion between 2020 and 2030. Th e tax would also be progressive. Nearly 70 percent of the tax burden would fall on those in the top income quintile, with 23 percent on those in the top 1 percent and approximately 85 percent on those in the top 40 percent of the income distribution. Th e proposal is even more progressive when calculating the tax burden across the wealth distribution, where fi nancial asset holdings are more concentrated. In this chapter, we discuss the many design and implementation parameters that are central to making an FTT a useful tax instrument. Our choices attempt to balance the objectives of raising revenue while preventing punitive eff ects on fi nancial markets and long-term savings vehicles. We also defi ne the FTT base to minimize the potential for shift ing investments off shore or to untaxed instruments. We propose a gradual phase-in of the FTT to allow policymakers to monitor market functioning, address avoidance techniques that will undoubtedly arise, and more carefully calibrate the level of the tax\u2014higher or lower\u2014based on the data that are gathered. Because the United States does not have recent experience with a nontrivial FTT, some questions about its eff ects\u2014including the degree of responsiveness of market participants and the precise amount of revenue that would be raised\u2014remain unanswered. Careful monitoring and data analysis during the implementation period can help to address these knowledge gaps and inform future adjustments of the FTT to achieve desired policy outcomes. Background Financial transaction taxes have a long history, both in theory and in practice. Th e theoretical basis for an FTT dates back at least to Keynes (1936), who conceived of an FTT as a way to discourage short-term speculation in stock markets. Th e idea was then reintroduced by Tobin (1978), Stiglitz (1989), and Summers and Summers (1989). Th ough the United States does not currently have a signifi cant FTT, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) collects a fee on equities, securities futures, and options that is used to fund the agency (the SEC Fee). As shown in table 1, the SEC Fee, currently 0.203 basis points on equities, Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 152 is small and does not raise much revenue. Th e United States had a more signifi cant FTT in the past. Beginning in 1914, the United States taxed all stock sales at a rate of 2 basis points of the par value and doubled that rate in 1932 to raise revenue in the midst of the Great Depression (Burman et al. 2016). However, the tax was phased out in 1965 as part of a broader package repealing a number of Depression-era excise taxes (Keightley 2010). Similarly, New York State and New York City imposed a tax on stock transfers from 1905 to 1981 (Pollin, Baker, and Schaberg 2003). EXISTING FTTS A number of contemporary FTTs are used abroad. Table 1 summarizes fi ve illustrative existing FTTs: the small SEC Fee and those in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. Th e Hong Kong FTT is notable as a relatively eff ective example in terms of both market context and the amount of revenue raised. Th e tax is currently 20 basis points (10 basis points levied on both the buyer and seller), aft er being reduced several times between 1991 and 2001, and is applied to stock transactions. Unlike many other international FTTs, the Hong Kong tax has been quite successful at g e n e ra tin g r ev e n u e, rai s in g ann ual p r o c e e ds e q ui v al e n t t o a p p r o xim a t e l y 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Th e tax also has not prevented Hong Kong from serving as a major fi nancial center. 3 MAGNITUDE OF PROPOSED FTT RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL TRANSACTION COSTS One way to evaluate the potential eff ects of an FTT is to put it in the context of other transaction costs. An FTT that represents a dramatic increase in transaction costs is likely to have a larger eff ect on market activities and generate higher economic costs than one that results in only a modest increase. We describe the state of transaction costs for buying and selling equities and fi xed income securities and discuss how they have evolved over several decades. In equities, trading costs such as the SEC Fee, exchange fees, and broker commissions result in aggregate direct costs of approximately 3 to 5 basis points on average for institutional transactions and 1 to 10 basis points for retail transactions. 4 Th ere are also indirect transaction costs because investors may need to pay more than the market price for on-demand liquidity (the ability to buy and sell immediately). One such measure of this cost is the bid-ask spread, which is oft en as little as $0.01 per share for the most liquid stocks but can be signifi cantly higher for smaller-cap companies. Larger institutional orders may incur more signifi cant indirect costs because they move the stock price, with the diff erence between the A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 153 TABLE 1.

Estimates of the average implementation shortfall for institutional orders in recent years range from approximately 10 basis points (Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz 2018) to 30 basis points (Virtu Financial 2019). In total, the average transaction-related costs are estimated to be between 15 and 35 basis points for larger institutional orders and 2 to 15 basis points for retail orders. 5 Current equity transaction costs are low by historical standards. Quoted bid-ask spreads were signifi cantly higher during the 1980s and 1990s, averaging between 20 and 60 basis points (Jones 2002).

Corporate bonds and municipal securities generally face higher costs: estimated corporate bond transaction costs are approximately 80 basis points for retail-sized trades and 5 to 50 basis points for larger institutional trades (Edwards, Harris, and Piwowar 2004; Harris 2015; Mizrach 2015), while estimated municipal security transaction costs are roughly 80 basis points for retail-sized trades and 20 to 70 basis points for larger trades (Wu 2018). Benchmark U.S. Treasury securities, on the other hand, have much lower transaction costs. Adrian, Fleming, and Vogt (2017) found narrow bid-ask spreads on institutional trading platforms: 0.8 basis points for the 2-year note, 1.0 basis points for the 5-year note, and 2.0 basis points for the 10-year note. Th ey also found average price impacts, an alternative measure of liquidity, of 10.8 basis points per 100 net trades for the 2-year note, 24.2 for the 5-year note, and 41.8 for the 10-year note. Historical transaction cost data are more limited for fi xed income markets, but they also appear to show some decline in costs over recent decades. 7 The Challenge: Assessing the FTT Based on Tax Principles Th e core challenge for tax policy is to raise a given amount of revenue in an equitable, effi cient, and administratively simple manner. In this section, we apply these considerations to an FTT and discuss implications for its design. EQUITY Any tax is ultimately paid by individuals, whether in their capacities a s c o n s u m e r s , w o r k e r s , o r o w n e r s o f c a p i t a l . F a i r n e s s r e q u i r e s t h a t t h e resulting tax burden be equitable , which is generally understood in terms of how it is distributed across individuals. A tax is vertically equitable if those with greater fi nancial resources pay a larger fraction of their resources. Th is concept is usually discussed in terms of whether (and to what extent) a tax is progressive. Th e progressivity of an FTT is determined by its economic incidence, or who actually bears the burden of the tax. Th e initial impact of introducing an FTT would be highly progressive. Using fi nancial asset ownership as a proxy for fi nancial transactions, the direct eff ects of introducing an FTT would disproportionately fall on those with high levels of wealth. Although some assets\u2014particularly 401(k) and Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 156 pension plans\u2014are held by those with moderate wealth, fi gure 1 shows that the top 10 percent of the wealth distribution accounts for 86 percent of household holdings of corporate equities and mutual fund shares, 81 percent of corporate and foreign bonds, and 79 percent of U.S. government and municipal securities holdings. Th e bottom 50 percent of the wealth distribution holds very little of the fi nancial wealth of the United States (see fi gures 1 and 2). Foreign investors are also signifi cant holders of U.S. fi nancial securities and would be a meaningful source of FTT revenue. 8 For families in the middle of the distribution, their most signifi cant fi nancial assets are oft en held indirectly, through retirement funds and pooled vehicles like mutual funds (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve S y s t e m [ F e d e r a l R e s e r v e ] 2 0 1 7 ) . Th e average mutual fund has annual turnover of approximately 32 percent (Investment Company Institute 2019), which suggests that the FTT would result in a relatively modest increase in fund expenses (e.g., a 10 basis point FTT implies approximately 3 basis points of annual costs at the average turnover). Direct trading within retirement accounts also appears to be limited: Mitchell et al. (2006) found t h a t 8 0 p e r c e n t o f 4 0 1 ( k ) p a r t i c i p a n t s i n i t i a t e d n o t r a d e s i n a t w o - y e a r period. Moreover, Ameriks, Wranik, and Salovey (2009) document that among investors between ages 40 and 64 with an IRA or 401(k) account, those with lower fi nancial wealth tended to trade less frequently, suggesting minimal direct FTT costs in these accounts. Defi ned-benefi t plans also represent a signifi cant fi nancial asset for some in the middle of the wealth distribution. Th e eff ect of the FTT on the future returns of plans would depend on the investment strategies employed. For example, investments in passive index funds 9 or illiquid strategies that have low levels of trading should have limited direct FTT costs. On the other hand, an FTT may reduce the returns on investments in funds that employ high turnover strategies, in which many plans invest to some extent.

Assessing the effi ciency implications of these distortions is complex, however, because they depend crucially on how various fi nancial market participants will respond and the optimal level of fi nancial activity. In this subsection, we review key effi ciency considerations associated with an FTT, along with the current state of research on these topics. We later discuss the A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 157 FIGURE 1.

Effi ciency Considerations Because FTTs are a tax on the gross, rather than net, value of fi nancial transactions, the same economic value can be taxed multiple times\u2014once at each trade (see box 1 for an alternative way to tax fi nancial activity). 11 Th us, the tax can cascade as more frequently traded assets are subject to the tax for each transaction, resulting in diff erences in eff ective tax rates across trading strategies, assets, and sectors. Th is diff erential tax treatment could lead to distortions in trading and portfolio decisions. For example, investors with passive trading strategies with infrequent trades would incur little tax compared with those who use more active strategies with higher turnover (incurring a tax on each occasion). 12 Companies and sectors more r e l i a n t o n t h e i s s u a n c e o f p u b l i c l y t r a d e d s e c u r i t i e s a l s o w o u l d b e m o r e aff ected by the FTT, with potential implications for resource allocation and economic effi ciency. A large empirical literature demonstrates that, by increasing transaction costs, an FTT will reduce trading volumes. Estimates of the magnitude of the eff ect, however, vary widely. 13 Trading responses to historical changes in FTTs and other transaction costs range from a sharp decline in trading (i.e., an elasticity of 1.7) to no response (Matheson 2012). More recent studies of the French FTT implemented in 2012 estimated trading volume declines of 15 to 30 percent (Capelle-Blancard and Havrylchyk 2016; Colliard and Hoff mann 2017; Haferkorn while the estimated volume decline following Italy's FTT implementation in 2013 was more modest (Cappelletti, Guazzarotti, and Tommasino 2016). To the best of our knowledge, evidence on the eff ects of some other FTTs, such as Hong Kong's (which is generally considered to be among the more successful), is limited. Opponents of an FTT argue that the reduced trading and higher transaction costs associated with the tax would harm liquidity and increase the cost of capital, with a resulting reduction in asset prices (Bond, Hawkins, and Klemm 2004; Habermeier and Kirilenko 2003; Schwert and that, even if initial issuances are untaxed, an FTT could increase the cost of capital through investor expectations about future resale prices. From a theoretical perspective, Coelho (2016a) estimates that a 20 basis point FTT would increase the cost of capital by 0.8 percent, whereas Amihud and Mendelson (1992) suggest that a 50 basis point FTT would increase the cost of capital by 1.33 percent. Estimates based on empirical data have A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 159 also shown the potential for FTTs to reduce asset prices (Bond, Hawkins, and Klemm 2004; Hu 1998; Umlauf 1993),14 wi th l ar g e r p ri ce r e d u cti o n s seen in more liquid securities (Amihud and Mendelson 1992). More recent estimates of asset price responses to changes in transaction costs have found smaller eff ects (Coelho 2016a; Deng, Liu, and Wei 2018). 15Th e magnitude of any change to the cost of capital and its associated effi ciency costs depends on a range of factors including the design of the tax and the underlying market ecosystem, for which our proposal may diff er from past empirical analyses. As we discuss later in more detail, the effi ciency implications of the proposal will crucially depend on the size of the tax, the types of trades that are discouraged by the increase in transaction costs, and the resulting incidence of the tax. While some have argued that an FTT could produce effi ciency gains b y r e d u c i n g v o l a t i l i t y , t h e e v i d e n c e o n t h i s p o i n t i s i n c o n c l u s i v e b o t h theoretically and empirically. Song and Zhang (2005) suggest that the volatility eff ect depends on the composition of traders in the market, whereas Vayanos (1998) shows that FTTs may have ambiguous volatility eff ects even in a market with only fundamental-based traders. 16 Empirically, FTT s have been found to be associated with decreases (Hanke et al. 2010; BOX 1. Financial Activity Taxes: An Alternative to an FTT An alternative to the FTT is a fi nancial activity tax (FAT) that would tax the net value, much as a value-added tax (VAT) does broadly for value added. Because an FTT taxes gross proceeds, the burden falls disproportionately on transaction-intensive businesses. A FAT, by contrast, taxes net proceeds and does not have this feature (Burman et al. 2016). However, a FAT may be infeasible given the diffi culty of measuring fi nancial value added. Indeed, the fi nancial sector is almost always exempt from a V A T in countries that use it (Burman et al. 2016; Merrill 1997). Th e effi ciency gains from reducing rent-seeking trading may also justify implementing an FTT even when a FAT is in place (Shaviro 2012). Moreover, if some variant of a FAT is infeasible, politically or otherwise, then a well-designed FTT is an attractive alternative for raising tax revenues in a progressive way.Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 160 Liu and Zhu 2009), increases (Capelle-Blancard and Havrylchyk Seguin 1997; Umlauf 1993), and no change (Hu 1998) in volatility. An effi c i e n c y a r g u m e n t c a n b e m a d e i n f a v o r o f a n F T T i f s o m e o f t h e activities that would be most aff ected add little to the allocative effi ciency of fi nancial markets and broader productivity and economic growth. Some fi nancial trades are merely zero-sum games whereby profi ts are delivered to the fi rst person to trade on new information. Summers and Summers (1989) and Stout (1995) showed that the amount of resources devoted to capturing trading profi ts is large. In recent decades, the economic resources devoted to capturing trading profi ts have been signifi cant. Th e advent of high-frequency trading (HFT) and algorithmic trading has resulted in large investments in human capital, physical infrastructure, and proprietary data to develop faster and more advanced trading algorithms. 17 Trading activity has increased dramatically, with U.S. equity trading volumes eight times higher than pre-2000 levels ( A v r a m o v i c 2 0 1 7 ) . Y e t , t h e r e i s l i t t l e e v i d e n c e t o s u g g e s t t h a t t h e a d d e d investment in trading and related infrastructure has increased economic growth. 18 Despite the decline in certain measures of trading costs over this period, productivity and business investment growth has been relatively low. 19 Under an FTT , some trading activity would be discouraged, rendered less profi table, or eliminated. Th e associated effi ciency costs depend on the types of fi nancial transactions that are discouraged and their implications for the allocative effi ciency of capital across the economy. Th e aff ected activities would likely include both trading that benefi ts overall market liquidity and price discovery, as well as some trading that has low to negative marginal value. Separating socially benefi cial trading from unproductive trading is a diffi cult\u2014perhaps infeasible\u2014task, and there is no obvious way to exempt from an FTT only the types of transactions that potentially provide value. Yet, current levels of trading are not necessarily optimal, nor is it clear that a decline in trading volume to, for example, levels that existed a decade ago would render fi nancial markets unable to perform their intermediation functions of aiding price discovery and allocating capital effi ciently. It seems likely that a meaningful share of the new trading activity that has evolved in recent decades has not signifi cantly enhanced these fi nancial market functions or economic growth. T o the extent that some of the d i s c o u r a g e d a c t i v i t y c o n s i s t s o f z e r o - s u m t r a n s a c t i o n s o r a c t s s i m p l y a s an additional layer of intermediation, and in some cases rent-seeking, not A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 161 all the distortions imposed by an FTT are in fact problematic. Th is would mitigate effi ciency costs of an FTT. Limiting Effi ciency Losses An FTT should be designed to minimize effi ciency losses and the potential for signifi cant tax avoidance. Th e historical evidence suggests that an FTT that is too high could have adverse eff ects on fi nancial markets. In addition, depending on how an FTT is designed, there could be signifi cant scope to avoid the tax based on (1) the location of transactions and (2) the particular instruments and institutions that are subject to the tax. For example, Sweden's failed FTT aptly demonstrates the implications of a poorly designed FTT and the importance of addressing the location o f t r a n s a c t i o n s s u b j e c t t o t h e t a x . I n 1 9 8 4 , S w e d e n ' s i n t r o d u c t i o n o f a 100 basis point FTT (increased to 200 basis points in 1986) led to a 5 percent decline in the Stockholm Stock Exchange and signifi cant erosion of trading on Swedish markets (Campbell and Froot 1994; Umlauf 1993). Because the Swedish FTT was imposed only on transactions requiring Swedish brokerage services, market participants could easily avoid the tax by eliminating the use of Swedish brokers and trading on UK and U.S. exchanges. Th e dramatic declines in trading volume on Swedish exchanges led to tax revenues well below projected levels, and Sweden's FTT was eliminated in 1991. Many of the problems experienced by Sweden can be addressed through the FTT design, including by applying a lower rate and preventing, as much as possible, the shift ing of transactions off shore to avoid the tax. In France and Italy, for example, the FTT applies to trading in shares issued by local companies whether traded onshore or off shore, including trading in American depositary receipts (ADRs). 20 To date, analyses of these FTTs have not found signifi cant increases in off shore trading to avoid the tax (Coelho 2016a). In addition, the size and scope of the U.S. fi nancial markets likely makes it more diffi c ul t f o r m ar k e t p arti c i p an t s t o s hift off shore as they did in Sweden. It is also important for the FTT design to minimize the potential for investors to shift from taxed to untaxed fi nancial instruments. Th is is a particular concern for derivatives. Some existing FTTs\u2014such as those in the United Kingdom, France, and Hong Kong\u2014do not apply to derivatives, the taxation of which presents diffi cult conceptual and administrative issues. However, if derivatives are untaxed, they can be structured to b e e c o n o m i c a l l y e q u i v a l e n t t o t h e p u r c h a s e o f a n u n d e r l y i n g s e c u r i t y , allowing market participants to avoid the FTT (Shaviro 2012). Contracts Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 162 for diff erence (CFDs), which are widespread in Europe, allow one party to pay the other party the diff erence between the current value of an asset and its value at a future date. If untaxed, this type of arrangement can be used as a way of escaping the FTT, as has occurred in the United Kingdom and France. When describing our proposed FTT, we discuss the design choices made to address these potential modes of tax avoidance. More generally, tax enforcement agencies will likely require strong authority to respond eff ectively to avoidance and evasion. Not all structures that could be used to avoid the tax can be identifi ed at the outset (as evidenced by UK CFDs, which were developed in the 1990s), hence the importance of the annual review we propose during the phase-in period of the tax. ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY An FTT would be relatively simple to administer. While aspects of the design, such as how certain instruments are taxed, require careful calibration, a small tax on each transaction is easy for taxpayers to comply with and straightforward for the tax authority to administer. Th e signifi cant infrastructure that is already in place to facilitate and report fi nancial market transactions can be used to collect the FTT and decrease compliance costs. Moreover, this fi nancial market plumbing, which includes exchanges, clearinghouses, settlement systems, and intermediaries that facilitate execution, is concentrated in a small number of fi rms. International FTTs ha v e used this infrastru ctur e in th e co ll ecti o n an d administra ti o n o f th e tax and generally have low compliance costs relative to the revenue raised (Brondolo 2011). In the United States, processes that are already in place to collect the SEC Fee for equities could be expanded to collect a broader FTT. For exchange-traded instruments, the small number of exchanges could be responsible for collecting the FTT on all transactions on their platforms. Collecting the FTT on over-the-counter (OTC) transactions likely entails somewhat higher compliance and administrative costs. But, again, processes already in place for equities can likely be expanded to other instruments, with the broker-dealers that execute client transactions assuming primary responsibility for collecting the FTT. Notably, the FTT would not be the only tax for which broker-dealers act as collection agents; for example, they withhold taxes on certain types of investment and dividend income of foreign investors. Th ough some have suggested excluding OTC transactions from the FTT, doing so could open signifi cant opportunities to avoid the tax. 21A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 163 The Challenge: Assessing the Effects of an FTT on Financial Markets Th e framework outlined above is an appropriate starting place for evaluating the potential role of an FTT in the U.S. tax system. In this s e c t i o n , w e s u p p l e m e n t t h a t a n a l y s i s b y d e s c r i b i n g t h e c u r r e n t s t a t e o f fi nancial markets and assessing the likely impacts of the introduction of an FTT given the existing market structure and ecosystem. To achieve its objectives, an FTT should be tailored to avoid unnecessary economic and fi nancial market disruption. CURRENT MARKET ECOSYSTEM To assess the potential eff e c t s o f a n F T T , i t i s i m p o r t a n t t o u n d e r s t a n d c h a n g e s t h a t h a v e o c c u r r e d i n fi nancial markets over the past several decades. Many markets have shift ed from manual trading conducted over the phone or on exchange trading fl oors to automated electronic systems interacting across a network of trading venues (Joint Staff Report 2015; SEC 2010). In the most liquid markets, technology has increased both the speed and sophistication of trading and has allowed many functions to be automated through computer algorithms responsible for trading decisions, execution, and booking. Th e roles and types of fi nancial intermediaries have also evolved. Principal trading fi rms (PTFs), which typically rely on low-latency, automated trading strategies (i.e., HFT) and take on little net exposure, now represent a signifi c a n t p o r t i o n o f t r a d i n g a c t i v i t y i n m o s t l i q u i d m a r k e t s . I n standardized asset classes, these fi rms have become the primary market makers. However, they also employ a variety of strategies beyond liquidity provision, including attempting to capture small arbitrage opportunities between related products, leveraging structural advantages in speed or data, and seeking to anticipate and trade ahead of large orders (SEC 2010). PTFs are primarily prevalent in the most liquid markets, including in on-the-run Treasury securities, large-cap equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), futures, and foreign exchange markets. Automated trading has also facilitated the creation of new investment funds\u2014frequently structured as hedge funds\u2014that focus on algorithmic a n d q u a n t i t a t i v e s t r a t e g i e s ( r e f e r r e d t o h e r e i n a s \" a l g o r i t h m i c f u n d s \" o r AFs). AFs generally rely on sophisticated data and complex models to create automated trading strategies, and they oft en exploit relatively small price discrepancies. Unlike PTFs, AFs frequently manage outside capital and Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 164 take directional positions over longer periods, though their holding periods may still be only days or weeks. Changes in trading are not limited to these new classes of intermediaries. Large fi nancial fi rms use HFT and other algorithmic trading in their market-making and trade execution strategies, and long-term institutional investors use algorithms to break up orders and send them across diff erent trading centers to minimize implementation shortfalls. Note that the t r a n s f o r m a t i o n i n t r a d i n g v a r i e s a c r o s s m a r k e t s . L e s s l i q u i d m a r k e t s , including off -the-run Treasury securities, corporate bonds, municipal debt, and swaps, continue to rely on signifi cant manual trading. Th e evidence on the eff ects of HFT and algorithmic trading on market liquidity, effi ciency, and volatility is mixed. Assessing market liquidity itself is complex, and no single defi nition or all-encompassing metric is available. Most research suggests that HFT and algorithmic trading have improved some measures of market liquidity , such as lowering bid-ask spreads, and have enhanced short-term price discovery (SEC 2014). However, other studies have found that HFT can increase transaction costs, including implementation shortfalls, for larger institutional orders (Tong 2015). HFT and algorithmic trading may also have played a role in recent so-called fl ash events in key markets including equities, U.S. Treasuries, and foreign exchange (Easley, L\u00f3pez de Prado, and O'Hara 2011; Federal Reserve 2019c; Joint Staff Report 2015; Kirilenko et al. 2017). EFFECTS OF AN FTT A s n o t e d , b o t h t h e o r y a n d h i s t o r i c a l e v i d e n c e s u g g e s t t h a t a n F T T w i l l lower trading activity. Th e most pronounced eff ects are likely to be on low- margin, high-volume activity, such as PTF activity, certain AF strategies, and some other forms of intermediation, because they oft en rely on exploiting relatively small profi t opportunities over short holding periods. As a result, even a small FTT may exceed the expected profi t or hurdle rate on many of these trades. While comprehensive empirical data on the eff ects of FTT s in the modern market ecosystem are limited, Colliard and Hoff mann (2017) found that HFT fi rms (i.e., PTFs) experienced a 35 percent reduction in trading volume following the implementation of France's FTT. 22 Th is reduction occurred despite design features intended to exempt much of their activity from the tax.23 Other forms of intermediation activities also may be aff ected by an FTT. For example, large broker-dealers make markets in a variety of derivative and other fi nancial products by entering into off setting transactions to mitigate their risks. Th ese activities can include dynamic hedging, in which they A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 165 adjust their position in the off setting stock, bond, or other instrument as prices change over the life of the contract. If each transaction in a dynamic hedging strategy is subject to an FTT, providing these products could become more costly. Th ese costs may be passed on to institutional investors and corporations hedging their own risks or may reduce the availability of certain derivative products. 24 Th e pricing of ETFs would also be aff ected. ETFs maintain a market price that seeks to replicate the value of the underlying assets they hold by allowing traders to exploit any deviation: if the price of the ETF increases above (or falls below) the value of the underlying securities, market participants buy (or sell) the securities to create (or redeem) the ETF. Th is arbitrage activity would become more expensive because of the FTT associated with buying or selling securities and as a result would likely require a larger gap between an ETF price and its underlying value before becoming profi table. In addition, PTFs and AFs account for a signifi cant portion of ETF trading. Th at said, a well-designed FTT would not be expected to prevent continued investment through ETFs. Finally, investment strategies that encompass more frequent trading may be disproportionately aff ected by an FTT. For example, factor-based investing, which targets specifi c return drivers (such as size, value, or momentum) across asset classes, may become less competitive because these investments generally have higher turnover than other funds and as a result would incur more FTT costs. Importantly, the extent to which the above activities, and markets more generally, would be aff ected by an FTT is uncertain and depends on the rate and design of the FTT. U.S. equities are already subject to a very low FTT in the form of the existing SEC Fee. At this level of approximately 0.2 basis points, the trading elasticity appears to be relatively low (Auten and Matheson 2010) and the eff ect on market activities seems to be limited, even among the most sensitive participants, such as PTFs. As the FTT rate increases, progressively more activity would be curtailed: fi rst the highest frequency PTF activity would become unprofi t a b l e , f o l l o w e d b y o t h e r intermediation and short-term AF trading strategies. Th ere is some FTT rate at which the reduction in activities would be harmful to markets, such as Sweden's 200 basis point FTT, yet there is little empirical evidence to pinpoint where between 0.2 and 200 basis points this breakpoint resides. Given current and historical transaction costs, as previously described, the proposed 10 basis point FTT appears unlikely to increase costs beyond manageable levels. Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 166 Th e eff ect of an FTT on fi nancial markets, the magnitude of effi ciency costs, and how those costs are distributed will depend on the relative elasticities of market participants with respect to the tax. For an end investor, 25 the costs of an FTT will include (1) the direct costs of the FTT on their trading activity, (2) any increase in indirect transaction costs as a result of changes in intermediation, and (3) the costs of any broader eff ects on the availability and cost of capital as well as the allocative effi ciency of fi nancial markets that have negative consequences for asset prices, productivity, and economic growth. Regarding end investor direct costs, a 10 basis point FTT relative to the total expected return of a long-term investment should be relatively small. For example, an individual invested in mutual funds would not incur a direct FTT on the purchase or sale of fund shares. Th e fund may pass on the FTT costs associated with its trading to the investor, which for a mutual fund with an average level of turnover would imply 3 basis points of additional costs per year, quite small relative to the fees many funds charge. 26 Th e indirect costs are less certain and depend on the response of other market participants and the incidence of the tax. Some have speculated that reductions in market making and in trading volume more generally could result in signifi cantly higher transaction costs, such as increases in bid-ask spreads (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association [SIFMA] 2019a). But, in part, this will depend on how much of the FTT i s p a s s e d o n f r o m i n t e r m e d i a r i e s t o e n d i n v e s t o r s . F o r e x a m p l e , m a r k e t makers that provide liquidity to other investors could respond to an FTT by (1) increasing bid-ask spreads to off set the cost of the FTT, (2) partially absorbing the cost through lower profi ts or compensation, or (3) reducing trading activity. Th e result would likely involve some combination of the three, as the ability to fully pass on these costs has limits due to the competitive nature of fi nancial markets. As bid-ask spreads increase, the value of this intermediation declines, and direct transactions between natural buyers and sellers (i.e., without intermediation by a market maker) may increase, particularly for heavily traded securities. In addition, m uch of the activity that would be most aff ected by an FTT is not dedicated to market making. As a fi rst-order eff ect, reductions in these activities would be expected to decrease the profi ts and compensation fl owing to the associated fi rms. Whether these foregone activities would also have indirect costs to end investors through reduced liquidity and higher transaction costs is less clear. Even within PTFs and AFs, there is heterogeneity among strategies that likely aff ects their potential exposure and response to an FTT as well as their marginal contribution to market A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 167 effi ciency and liquidity. While some aff ected activities likely contribute to reducing the cost of transacting and improving price discovery, others may provide limited economic benefi t while requiring investments in infrastructure, people, and data that exceed socially optimal levels. Even if a 10 basis point FTT curtails signifi cant trading activity, it would not necessarily materially reduce the effi ciency of capital allocation or impose meaningful indirect costs on end investors. Finally, as noted, some historical studies argue that the direct and indirect increases in transaction costs associated with FTTs could have signifi cant adverse eff ects on the cost of capital, asset prices, and economic growth. However, the empirical evidence is oft en based on much higher FTTs than the level proposed here (including fl a w e d F T T s s u c h a s t h e o n e implemented in Sweden) and relies on data from before the evolution of the modern market ecosystems. Moreover, despite some theoretical models linking liquidity and asset prices (Acharya and Pedersen 2005), little evidence indicates that the magnitude of the change in transaction costs contemplated here would have meaningful eff ects. However, the responses of market participants to the proposed FTT are admittedly uncertain, and that is why we propose an incremental implementation. By starting at low levels and phasing the FTT in over several years, a data-driven approach can be employed to assess these key questions and determine the appropriate ultimate FTT level. The Proposal We propose an FTT that would begin at 2 basis points and increase by 2 basis points each year until it reaches a target rate of 10 basis points. 27 Th is gradual implementation would allow Congress to monitor the eff ects of the FTT and potentially modify scheduled increases. To support this Congressional review, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in consultation with market regulators (the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) and banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the Offi ce of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), would be responsible for submitting an annual report assessing market functioning, avoidance activities that arise, and the appropriate calibration of the FTT. Table 2 describes the key features of the proposal. Th e FTT would apply to a broad base of fi nancial transactions of stocks, bonds, and derivatives, both on exchanges and OTC, and would be remitted by sellers. It would apply to all transactions involving securities issued in the United States and derivatives linked to securities issued in the United States, as well as Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 168 both onshore and off shore trading by U.S. persons to prevent tax avoidance responses. New equity and debt issuance would be exempted, as would repo and securities lending transactions, money market instruments with terms of less than 90 days, and trading in U.S. Treasury securities. Th e issuance and redemption of both ETF and mutual fund shares would not be subject to the FTT, though assets sold by mutual funds and trading in ETF shares would be taxed. For stocks and bonds, the FTT rate would apply to the market value of transactions. For derivatives, both the tax rate and the tax base would need to be tailored to the nature of the contract, as described below in the section on FTT implementation. Primary responsibility for collecting the FTT would fall to exchanges and\u2014for OTC transactions\u2014broker-dealers. DESIGN Th e two core questions for FTT design are (1) the specifi cation of the tax base and (2) the choice of the tax rate. We discuss the considerations that inform both choices below. Tax Base A broad base is desirable in order to limit tax avoidance responses. For this reason, we propose the inclusion of (1) OTC transactions, which are admittedly more diffi cult to tax than transactions on exchanges; (2) debt instruments, the exclusion of which could, on the margin, increase the e x i s t i n g b i a s t o w a r d d e b t fi nancing; and (3) derivative transactions, as excluding them would present signifi cant avenues to avoid the FTT. Of note, FTTs in other developed countries have generally excluded debt and most derivative transactions. While their inclusion adds complexity to the FTT, we believe their inclusion is warranted to limit distortions and increase the revenue raised. Th at said, while the proposed FTT does not appear excessively high relative to transaction costs in non-Treasury fi xed income markets, it may be a signifi cant cost relative to expected investment returns. Th us, the eff ect on these securities would warrant special scrutiny during the implementation phase. We also propose to include market-making activities in the FTT. Many countries with FTTs (e.g., United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Hong Kong) have included a market-making exemption, but such an exemption is A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 169 TABLE 2. Key Features of the FTT Proposal Category Proposal EquitiesaThe tax rate would initially be 2 basis points of the market value of the transaction (\"base rate\"). The base rate would be scheduled to increase by 2 basis points each year until the tax rate reaches 10 basis points. Bonds Tax would be based on the base rate and the market value of the transaction. Derivatives Given the complexity, the FTT rate and base will likely differ by type of instrument to limit differences between economically equivalent transactions (e.g., between purchasing a swap or purchasing the underlying security) and avoidance opportunities. For the purposes of scoring our initial proposal, we assume the following: Options would be taxed at the base rate, based on the premium paid; the base rate would also apply to the value of the strike price if exercised. Security-based swaps would be taxed at the base rate, applied to the notional value. Interest rate swaps would be taxed at the base rate, applied to all cash payments made (excluding interim collateral exchanges). For futures and forwards, rates would vary based on asset class. Certain derivatives, such as those that are functionally equivalent to short-term nancing (e.g., foreign exchange swaps with short maturities), would be exempt. OTC transactionsThe FTT would apply to OTC transactions in addition to those on exchanges. Application The cost of the FTT would be paid by the seller, as is the case with the SEC Fee.

Market makers Not exempt Direct issuance of annuities and life insuranceExempt Mutual funds and ETFsIssuance and redemption of mutual fund shares would not be subject to the FTT, but the sale of investments by mutual funds would be subject to the FTT. Mutual funds would have the right to charge redemption fees to investors to recoup the FTT costs associated with selling securities when shares are redeemed. The creation and redemption of ETF shares would not be subject to the FTT, but trading in the underlying ETF shares and buying or selling securities by authorized participants (or other market participants acting through ETF authorized participants) to create or redeem the ETF basket would also be subject to the FTT. Collection Primary responsibility for collecting the FTT would fall to exchanges and, for OTC transactions, broker-dealers. Scope The FTT would apply to all of the following: Onshore and offshore transactions by all investors, including foreign investors, in securities issued by U.S. persons and securities issued by foreign persons in the United States Onshore and offshore transactions by all investors, including foreign investors, in derivatives linked to securities issued by U.S. persons and derivatives linked to securities issued by foreign persons in the United States Onshore and offshore trades by U.S. persons (and their controlled foreign entities) in securities issued by foreign persons Onshore and offshore trades by U.S. persons (and their controlled foreign entities) in non-securities-based derivative transactions Implementation The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the regulatory agencies, will monitor the effects of the FTT and submit an annual report to Congress during the implementation period. The report may include recommendations to modify scheduled increases in the base rate or application to certain nancial instruments based on an assessment of the effect of the FTT on nancial market functioning, avoidance activities that arise, and revenue raised by the FTT. a The FTT would apply in same manner and at same rate to publicly traded partnership (PTP) inter- ests of U.S. partnerships. b Exemption would not apply to a broker-dealer that makes a market in its own debt or equity securi- ties or those of any of its affi liates.A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 171 diffi cult to tailor narrowly and can reduce eff ectiveness and revenue raised. Th e lack of a market-making exemption could lead to some cascading of the FTT, with market makers and other intermediaries passing on some portion of the FTT in the form of higher transaction costs. Some experts have also pointed to the risk of more dramatic cascading, with the tax applied multiple times to the set of intermediating transactions involving a broker-dealer, a clearing agent, and a clearinghouse in what is eff ectively a single transaction. Th ese technical issues can be addressed with a careful defi nition of the FTT-relevant transaction and through narrow exemptions. For example, under the current SEC Fee, a single trade involving multiple parties, such as a third party that assumes settlement obligations for the trade, is considered only one transaction for purposes of the fee. Th e SEC Fee rules also exempt a recognized riskless principal sale in which a broker-dealer engages in two contemporaneous off setting transactions. Similarly, b roker ed transacti o ns made in the name o f a clien t o r tha t ha v e the so l e purpose of executing and clearing the transaction would not be considered individual transactions subject to the FTT. Some exemptions to the FTT are necessary. We describe these exemptions in table 3. Two exemptions warrant extended discussion. First, several features of the market for U.S. Treasury securities and futures argue against imposing a 10 basis point FTT. Bid-ask spreads for benchmark U.S. Treasury securities have averaged 1 to 2 basis points over the past several decades. Th erefore, an FTT would result in a more signifi cant increase in transaction costs for these markets than for other fi xed income markets. Th is increase could be particularly disruptive given the critical role that Treasury securities serve in the global economy. If the FTT were to aff ect the value of U.S. Treasury securities, then federal government borrowing costs would increase, off setting the revenue raised from an FTT. 28 Second, excluding the issuance and redemption of mutual fund and ETF shares from the FTT prevents the double taxation that could otherwise result. 29 A b s e n t t h i s e x e m p t i o n , i n t h e c a s e o f m u t u a l f u n d s , i n v e s t o r s would pay an FTT when redeeming fund shares while the fund also would potentially face FTT costs if it needed to sell securities because of changes in its net assets. Th is exemption is also consistent with the application of the SEC Fee. Admittedly, because of diff erences in the structures of ETFs and mutual funds, it could result in the FTT being more or less favorable to one structure over the other. But excluding fund issuance and redemption is consistent with the objective of ensuring that an FTT does not have a punitive eff ect on long-term savings vehicles nor inhibit the ability to Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 172 provide low-cost passive investment options.30 Excluding all mutual fund and ETF trading, on the other hand, would allow funds to become vehicles to avoid the FTT. While the eff ect on mutual funds and ETFs will need to be monitored as part of an FTT implementation, in an analysis of a proposed European Commission FTT of 20 basis points, BlackRock (2013) estimated that the direct cost would be modest (1 to 4 basis point annual increase in fund expenses) for ETFs replicating the largest equity indices. Tax Rate Because the FTT is a gross tax, potentially applying many times to the same asset, the optimal rate (and indeed the revenue-maximizing rate, which is not necessarily the same) is likely to be small. We propose that the rate (applicable to equity, debt, and most derivative transactions) be phased in until it reaches 10 basis points. Th ere is limited empirical evidence to determine the ideal rate, and additional analysis during the implementation period will be benefi cial. 31 In the absence of such data, we recommend a rate TABLE 3. Transactions Exempted from the Proposed FTT Type of exemption Rationale Equity and debt issuance, redemptions, and repurchasesThese exemptions are consistent with other FTTs as well as the desire to limit the effect on cost of new capital. Treasury securities and futuresThey have consistently low transaction costs, affect government funding costs, and serve a critical role in the global economy, including providing the world's risk-free benchmark. Money market instruments (with terms of less than 90 days)They are likely to be highly sensitive to incremental costs or frictions, which could disrupt market functioning. Certain derivatives that are functionally equivalent to short-term nancing (e.g., foreign exchange swaps with short maturities) would also be exempt. Repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions aThey play an important role in nancial market plumbing and generally have relatively short duration and low absolute return, making them more sensitive to an increase in transaction costs. Mutual fund and ETF issuance and redemption bThis exemption is consistent with the current SEC Fee and avoids double taxation that could otherwise result from end investors buying or selling fund shares. a The FTT would apply to any transactions facilitated by repurchase agreement or securities lend- ing, such as a short sale of a security. b Underlying transactions by mutual funds and trading in ETF shares would be subject to the FTT .A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 173 of 10 basis points to strike an appropriate balance between raising revenue and minimizing the effi ciency costs of the tax. While we have proposed that the same rate would apply to equity and debt transactions, the appropriate rate for each, and whether they should diff er, will require further study during the implementation period. For many debt investments, a 10 basis point FTT would represent a higher portion of the expected cumulative return than would likely be the case for an equity investment of similar duration. Th is may be particularly true in the current low interest rate environment and for lower-risk municipal and investment grade securities. Th erefore, it may be the case that the rate for debt securities, aft er the phase-in period, should be less than 10 basis points. 32 Regarding derivatives, a sensible aspiration for an FTT is to subject economically equivalent transactions to the same tax rate, thereby avoiding any distortions in the composition of fi nancial transactions. In particular, the FTT rate (or schedule of rates) would need to avoid creating an incentive to shift activity between cash and derivative instruments. As Matheson ( 20 12 ) points out, because fi nancial products that represent the same economic value can be structured in myriad ways with diff erent transaction intensities, it is generally not possible to design an FTT that taxes all economically equivalent contracts identically. Th ere are multiple ways to structure the same economic payout through derivatives, and it would not be possible to capture all such diff erences in a functional tax regime. However, attempts can be made to design the tax rate and base applied to derivative transactions to limit distortions and opportunities for tax avoidance. Some FTT proposals focus on the notional value of derivatives, oft en applying a lower tax rate to derivatives on this basis. Others only tax the amount of any payments made under the derivative contract. However, both methods present potential problems if applied to all types of derivatives. Notional values can be manipulated to reduce the tax, and applying a lower rate on certain products (or applying the FTT only to the payments made under the contract) can result in a lower FTT on certain derivative products (e.g., a total return swap) relative to equivalent stock and bond purchases. Given the complexity of derivatives, the FTT rate and base will likely need to be diff e r e n t i a t e d b y t y p e o f i n s t r u m e n t t o l i m i t d i ff erences between economically equivalent transactions. In some cases, such as total return swaps and other securities-based swaps, it is appropriate to apply the base rate to notional value so that the FTT levied on such transactions is comparable to that of acquiring the underlying securities. In other cases, Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 174 such as interest rate swaps in which the magnitude of the notional value is signifi cantly larger than the expected cash fl ow, the cash payments made under the contract may be a more accurate representation of value exchanged, and thus applying the FTT to these amounts may be more appropriate. A well-functioning FTT will also require strong enforcement and anti- evasion powers. 33 For example, an anti-abuse rule could specify that if a derivative transaction were \"substantially equivalent\" to owning the underlying securities, the transaction would be taxed at the same level. 34 ADMINISTRATION Primary responsibility for collecting the FTT would fall to exchanges and\u2014for OTC transactions\u2014broker-dealers. In implementing its current fees on equities, options, and security futures, the SEC has already identifi ed mechanisms to measure transaction volume and collect the fee through exchanges and broker-dealers and their self-regulatory organizations. Extending the FTT to bonds and all derivatives would likely require the development of new systems and processes but could also leverage the existing roles played by exchanges, clearinghouses, settlement systems, and broker-dealers to facilitate collection and compliance. Even for OTC transactions, many are cleared, settled, and oft en intermediated by large broker-dealers. IMPLEMENTATION Our proposal is designed to accommodate implementation issues, foreseen and unforeseen, through a gradual transition process. Implementation of an FTT in the United States should be incremental, starting at low rates, so that its eff ects on fi nancial markets can be measured and assessed. 35 Th e U.S. Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the regulatory agencies, s h o ul d p r o vi d e an an n u al a s s e s s m e n t t o C o n gr e s s s o th a t an y n e c e s s ary adjustments can be enacted. Th is assessment is especially important because of the limited empirical evidence about the eff ects of a signifi cant, broad- based FTT . M ost o f e histo ri cal experi en ce is wi th m u ch small er FTT s (e.g., the SEC Fee) or FTTs with signifi cant exemptions (e.g., the UK Stamp Duty and FTTs in France and Italy). Th e implementation period would also allow Congress to make adjustments to address avoidance techniques that will undoubtedly arise and make more precise and data-driven assessments of the optimal FTT level, which may ultimately be above or below 10 basis points. A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 175 Another key implementation concern is that of harmonization with foreign markets and governments. Ideally, an FTT would be implemented in coordination with other countries, and we recommend that U.S. policymakers actively work with foreign counterparts to implement FTT s in line with that proposed here. Given the size and scope of U.S. fi nancial markets, an FTT in the United States could pave the way for adoption more broadly. In the absence of global coordination, the United States could take several steps to minimize off shore shift ing and any negative eff ects on the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets. Th e tax could apply to all trading in securities issued in the United States and derivatives linked to securities issued in the United States, regardless of whether the trade is executed onshore or off shore. Th e FTT also could be applied to all onshore and off shore trades by U.S. persons (and their controlled foreign entities) in securities issued by foreign persons to prevent incentives to shift investments from taxable U.S. securities to nontaxable foreign securities. Similarly, for derivative transactions that do not reference a security (e.g., interest rate swaps), the FTT could apply to all transactions involving a U.S. person. 36 While there would undoubtedly still be some eff orts to shift trading off shore in order to avoid an FTT, this concern is likely overstated in the case of the United States. Th e United States accounts for over 40 percent of global equity and corporate bond markets (SIFMA 2019b) and is home to many of the largest global fi nancial intermediaries. Given the size and centrality of U.S. markets, market participants have a limited ability to avoid trading on U.S. exchanges, in products cleared and settled over U.S. fi nancial utilities, or with large U.S. intermediaries. FTT compliance for off shore trading by U.S. persons could be facilitated by requiring collections by broker-dealers, clearing agencies, custodians, transfer agents, and other intermediaries. For example, large broker-dealers that intermediate most global OTC transactions would be responsible for collecting the FTT for off shore transactions with U.S. persons, even if the transaction is conducted through their non-U.S. subsidiaries. Importantly, the proposed FTT also would apply to transactions by foreign investors in U.S. markets. 37 As a result, the FTT from foreign investors would likely represent a signifi cant source of revenue. Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 176 POTENTIAL REVENUE RAISED Previous estimates suggest that an FTT could raise substantial sums. Assessing a 10 basis point tax on most fi nancial transactions, the Joint Committee on Taxation projected that it would raise $777 billion over 10 years (Congressional Budget Offi ce 20 1 8 ) . Burman et al. ( 20 1 6 ) estimated slightly lower revenue\u2014$705 billion over 10 years for a 10 basis point FTT\u2014and found that a much larger 50 basis point FTT would raise only $806 billion over 10 years, with behavioral responses that lead to reduced trading volumes limiting the incremental revenue. Some have estimated more signifi cant, but likely overstated, revenues from a higher FTT. For example, Pollin, Heintz, and Herndon (2018) estimated that a 50 basis point FTT would raise approximately $220 billion per year, or more than $2 trillion over 10 years, due to much lower elasticity and higher trading volume assumptions. 38 Table 4 provides revenue estimates for our proposal developed by TPC.39 Th e proposal would yield approximately $60 billion in annual revenue once the tax is fully phased in, and it would generate over $500 billion between 2020 and 2030. 40 Th e revenue estimate is based on a dynamic analysis that includes the eff ects of declines in trading volumes, assuming an elasticity of 1.25, and other responses to the implementation of the FTT.41 A lower TABLE 4. Federal Revenue Estimates Fiscal year Revenue raised (in billions) (TPC) calculations. a To be consistent with the methodology utilized by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the estimates assume an asset price decline following enactment of the FTT in 2020 that reduces capital gains tax revenue.A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 177 elasticity assumption of 1 (i.e., less decline in transaction volumes) would result in 2020-30 estimated revenue of $628 billion, while the estimated revenue under a higher elasticity assumption of 1.5 is $412 billion. Table 5 presents estimates of the distribution of the FTT burden in 2030 based on the TPC Microsimulation Model. As noted, the tax would be highly progressive: nearly 70 percent of tax burden would fall on taxpayers in the highest income quintile, and 23 percent falls on the top 1 percent. Th ese estimates may understate the concentration among those at the top of the income spectrum if the FTT reduces fi nancial sector rent-seeking (Burman et al. 2016). Th e proposal also is even more progressive when calculating the tax burden across the wealth distribution. As noted in fi gures 1 and 2, the dis tribution of fi nancial asset ownership by household wealth is extremely concentrated\u2014even more so than the distribution by household income that underlies Table 5. 42 Nevertheless, the analysis shows that our proposed FTT is a highly progressive tax with a burden of over $12,000 for households in the top one percent of the income distribution compared to just $10 for those in the bottom quintile. Th ose with no fi nancial assets outside of bank accounts would pay nothing at all. 43Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 178 TABLE 5.

Would exempting Treasury securities from the FTT distort debt markets? Th e U.S. Treasury market is already distinct from other fi xed income m ar k e t s . I t i s th e d e e p e s t an d m o s t li q ui d g o v e r nm e n t s e c uri ti e s m ar k e t in the world and plays a critical role in the global economy. It provides the world's risk-free benchmark, facilitates the implementation of monetary policy, provides the fi nancial system high-quality collateral, helps businesses to manage their risks, and fi nances the federal government. Treasuries already enjoy signifi cant liquidity advantages, including much lower transaction costs, relative to other debt securities. Th e FTT proposed here is unlikely to meaningfully change these dynamics. 2. Would a 10 basis point FTT be too high for debt securities given the current low interest rate environment? Th e implementation period is intended to allow further assessment of optimal FTT rates, including whether a lower rate may be warranted for debt securities. For secondary investments in debt securities, a 10 basis point FTT would represent a higher portion of the expected cumulative return than for an equity investment of similar duration, particularly given current low interest rates. By initially applying an FTT of 2 basis points and gradually increasing the rate, this proposal allows the eff ect on secondary debt markets and borrowing costs to be monitored to assess whether changes in the scheduled FTT rate increases, and a diff erentiated rate for debt securities, are needed. A lower FTT rate may be more appropriate for shorter-term debt securities. Th e proposed FTT would not apply to money market instruments with t e r m s o f l e s s t h a n 9 0 d a y s o r t h e i s s u a n c e o r r e d e m p t i o n o f s e c u r i t i e s . However, for secondary sales of short-term debt that does not fall under the exemption, the FTT would represent a higher portion of the expected cumulative return until maturity than for longer-term debt. To address this concern, some have called for the FTT tax rate applied to debt instruments to be scaled on the basis of the time remaining until maturity. While this gradation would add complexity to the FTT and has not been incorporated in this proposal, these dynamics should be monitored during the implementation period to assess any disproportionate eff ect on short- term securities or changes in issuance practices. 3. Would applying an FTT to municipal securities raise borrowing costs? Th e proposed FTT does not appear to represent a dramatic increase in transaction costs for municipal securities. However, the addition of a 10 Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 180 basis point FTT, particularly in the current low interest rate environment, could result in investors demanding higher yields. Th erefore, the eff ect on municipal securities should be monitored during the implementation phase to assess whether changes in the FTT rate are warranted. 4 . D o e s t h e p r o p o s a l s u ffi ciently diff erentiate between types of derivative transactions to avoid increasing hedging costs? Th e proposal includes examples of areas in which the application of the FTT may diff er by derivative product. For example, the FTT may be applied to the notional value for products linked to securities (e.g., total return swaps) while for other products it may be more appropriate to apply the FTT to cash payments made under the contract. However, given the complexity of derivatives, further diff erentiation by type of instrument, which goes beyond the scope of this paper, will likely be needed. Th e proposal envisions the application of the FTT to a broad range of derivative products, including those that may be used in hedging transactions. At a high level, we propose that the types of products used in hedging transactions, such as those linked to interest rates, would be subject to the FTT based on the actual payments made under the contract. Th ese payments may be a more accurate representation of value exchanged, and they may be much lower than the notional value. Along with the low rate of the FTT , this design is intended to prevent an excessive increase in the costs of these products. However, the eff ect of the FTT on the cost of hedging products and other derivatives should be monitored during the implementation phase. 5. Should pension funds receive an exemption, such as a tax credit for long- term holdings? Th e direct cost of the FTT on low-turnover, long-term investment strategies would be expected to be low (i.e., 10 basis points amortized over multiple years). Th us, the value of an exemption tied to long-term holdings is likely limited. In addition, as noted above, additional exemptions may add to the administrative complexity of the tax. 6. Would middle-income families face signifi cant FTT costs? Most households do not make large direct investments in stocks or bonds 44 or trade frequently, and as a result they would face limited direct FTT costs. Even if a household made a $10,000 stock purchase, the fully phased-in FTT cost of the transaction would be only $10. A number of factors also would likely limit the direct FTT costs associated with investments in funds and retirement accounts, through which A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 181 the majority of middle-income household fi nancial assets are held. Th e purchase and redemption of mutual fund shares would not be subject to the FTT. 45 While the sales of securities held by the funds would be subject to the FTT, the ultimate cost borne by investors will depend on the trading frequency and strategy employed. For a mutual fund with an average level of turnover, the direct FTT cost would represent approximately 3 basis points per year. Many index funds have even lower turnover levels: an S&P 500 index fund with 4 percent turnover would face direct FTT costs of 0.4 basis points per year. For an average family in the middle quintile, with $47,000 in combined pooled investment fund and retirement account fi nancial assets, 46 this incremental annual FTT cost would amount to $14 if its investments were in mutual funds with average turnover and $2 if its investments were in low-turnover index funds. 47 In addition, any savings held through bank accounts, certifi cates of deposit, or insurance products such as annuities would not be subject to the FTT. Conclusion Th e desire of policymakers to raise more revenue in a progressive way has led to a number of tax reform proposals, some of which entail the creation of new tax instruments. Our proposal for an FTT is another such option. While some fi nancial market activity would be discouraged by an FTT, we do not believe an FTT would hinder market functioning or impede price discovery. Moreover, some of the foregone activity may be of limited marginal economic benefi t. Because the precise responses of market participants to the proposed FTT are admittedly uncertain, we propose that the tax be phased in over a four-year implementation period. Th is plan would allow policymakers to monitor market functioning, address avoidance techniques that will undoubtedly arise, and further refi ne and adjust certain elements of the proposal, supported by the data that would be collected. At the moderate rate we propose, an FTT would raise substantial revenue, and the burden would fall overwhelmingly on high-income taxpayers. As part of a broad portfolio of progressive tax reforms, such an FTT can help pay for existing public obligations as well as the public investments that underlie future economic growth.Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 182 Glossary of Terms Algorithmic fund (AF) : Funds that rely on sophisticated data and complex models to create automated trading strategies and oft en take directional positions to exploit relatively small price discrepancies over days or weeks.

Endnotes 1. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the corporate income tax rate and increased the estate tax exemptions, while the Patient Protection and Aff ordable Care Act of 2010 included an incremental 3.8 percent tax on net investment income, including capital gains, for individuals with high income. 2. It would not apply to initial equity and debt issuances. 3. Several factors may limit the applicability of Hong Kong's FTT to the United States, including Hong Kong's signifi cantly smaller economy and the benefi ts it may realize from having a more predictable regulatory environment than other fi nancial markets in its region. 4. Th is includes the SEC Fee of 0.207 basis points, exchange fees of up to $0.0030 per share (i.e., 0.30 basis points on a $100 share of stock), and commissions. For inst itutional transactions, commissions over recent years have averaged 3 to 5 basis points (Virtu Financial 2019). For retail transactions, until recently many online brokers charged approximately $5 per trade (e.g., see Huang 2018), which would equate to approximately 10 basis points for a trade of $5,000. However, recently several retail brokerages have eliminated trading commissions (e.g., see Baer 2019 ). 5. Th is includes both direct costs (e.g., SEC Fee, commi ssions) and indirect costs (e.g., implementation shortfall). Inst itutional orders of smaller-cap stocks have higher transaction-related cos ts: Virtu Financial (2019) estimates total average costs of 50 to 60 basis points for mid-cap and 80 to 90 basis points for small-cap stocks. Retail estimate based on commissions of $0 to $5 per trade and half of estimated bid-ask spreads of 1 basis point for large-cap stocks (authors' calculations based on S&P 500 stocks) and 5 basis points for small- to mid-cap stocks (authors' calculation based on shares of stocks with market cap between $500 million and $10 billion). 6. Virtu Financial (2019) estimates a decline in inst itutional costs per transaction of appro ximately 15 basis points, or 30 basis points combined to buy and later sell a security (a \"round-trip\" transaction), compared with the proposed FTT of 10 basis points per round-trip transaction. 7. Mizrach (2015) estimated a decline in corporate bond bid-ask spreads of 40 to 60 basis points from 2003 to 2015. Wu (2018) estimated signifi cant declines in eff ective spreads for municipal securities transactions between 2005 and 2018, particularly for smaller trades. Adrian, Fleming, and Vogt (2017) found average bid-ask spreads from 1991 to 2000 to be fairly comparable to those for 2001 to 2017 but found higher price impacts (16.8 basis points per 100 net trades for the 2-year note, 31.3 for the 5-year note, and 54.5 for the 10-year note). 8. For example, foreign holders own approximately 15 percent of U.S. corporate equities (Federal Reserve 2019b). 9. For example, in 2018 Vanguard had annual portfolio turnover of 3 percent for its Total Stock Market Index Fund, 4 percent for its S&P 500 Index Fund, 9 percent for its Total World Stock Index Fund, and 54 percent for its Total Bond Market Index Fund. 10. Understanding the longer-run distribution of the FTT burden is complex and will depend on a Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 184 number of factors, including eff ects on cost of capital and relative elasticities of supply and demand for capital and labor (see, e.g., Baker and Woo (2015) for a discussion of the issues around the economic incidence of an FTT). To the extent that an FTT raises the cost of capital, some of the tax burden will fall on owners of capital. Any reduction in the aft er-tax return on capital investments would reduce the capital stock in the economy. As a result, some of this tax burden would be passed on to workers as they become less productive. Ho w these tax burdens are allocated depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand for capi tal and labor, in addition to the extent to which fi nancial intermediaries pass on the tax to investors. 11. Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) show that, under certain conditions, taxes on intermediary inputs to production are less effi cient than taxes on fi nal outputs or taxes on intermediate inputs that are creditable (e.g., a value-added tax). 12. Th e FTT would compound the costs of existing taxes on complementary activities, such as corporate investment and savings. An additional tax on securities transactions would also compound the investor \"lock-in\" eff ect by increasing the disincentive to sell assets that appreciated in value. Depending on its design, an FTT could also contribu te to debt bias, in which debt receives more favorable tax treatment than equity. Our proposed FTT would apply equally to debt and equity, though a diff erential eff ective tax rate could arise through diff erences in trading frequencies across asset classes. 13. See, for example, Jackson and O'Donnell (1985) in the United Kingdom; Lindgren and Westlund (1990), Umlauf (1993), and Campbell and Froot (1994) in Sweden; and Buchanan (2012), Colliard and Hoff mann (2013), Haferkorn and Zimmermann (2013), Meyer, Wagener, and Weinhardt (2013), and Coelho (2016a) in France. 14. Th e theoretical eff ect of an FTT on asset prices is ambiguous, as an FTT would generally increase both the liquidity premium and rate of return required by investors to hold stocks, putting downward pressure on stock prices (Habermeier However, if an FTT reduces excessive volatility, the required risk premium would fall and could lead to higher stock prices (Vayanos 1998). 15. For example, a partial equilibrium model, such as that presented in Matheson (2012). 16. Others have suggested that if there is a suffi cient proportion of noise traders that creates a wedge between the fundamental value of a stock and its market price, an FTT could reduce short-term speculation and, as a result, the noise-to-fundamental ratio in market prices (Stiglitz 1989; Summers and Summers 1989; Tobin 1978). Th ese taxes may, instead, discourage a suffi cient amount of fundamental-based trades, reducing price discovery and increasing volatility (Edwards 1993; Grundfest and Shoven 1991; Kupiec 1996; Schwert and D\u00e1vila (2013), however, suggests that volatility eff ects are uninformative as a metric for the effi ciency costs of an FTT. 17. Th is is not to say that signifi cant resources were not devoted to trading, or large market-making profi ts, prior to the development of HFT and algorithmic trading. In many cases, automated processes replaced functions that had been previously performed manually, reducing the required human capital. 18. Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012) show that in advanced economies, a fast-growing fi nancial sector has been detrimental to aggregate productivity growth. 19. Philippon (2015) fi nds that despite the advancements in data and technology, the per-unit cost of intermediation has remained stable since the 1900s. 20. An ADR is a negotiable certifi cate for shares of a non-U.S. fi rm that are deposited in a foreign bank. ADRs were created to enable U.S. investors to more easily trade shares in foreign companies. 21. To limit tax avoidance the proposed FTT would also require tax collection for off shore trades made by U.S. persons. Th is requirement could be facilitated by requiring collections by broker-dealers, clearing agencies, custodians, transfer agents, and other intermediaries. 22. Consistent with the notion that a small FTT would cause larger behavioral responses for HFTs, Coehlo (2016a) fi nds a much larger lock-in elasticity for HFTs than for traditional traders (9 versus 0.8). 23. For example, France's FTT exempts market-making activity and only applies to net daily position changes. While France also implemented a 1 basis point tax on the notional amount of modifi ed or cancelled messages by HFTs exceeding an order-to-trade ratio of 5:1, it applies only to HFTs residing in France and excludes market-making activity, and as a result it is believed to have had A Proposal to Tax Financial Transactions 185 minimal impact (Colliard and Hoff mann 2017). 24. It is also possible that an FTT could result in greater concentration in intermediation and other market making if larger intermediaries have greater capacity to manage these costs. 25. Th at is, the individuals and institutions that are the ultimate benefi ciaries of fi nancial investments. 26. For example, based on average annual turnover of 32 percent (Investment Company Inst itute 2019) and $47,000 of average combined pooled investment fund and retirement account fi nancial assets for a middle-income family (calculated based on Federal Reserve 2017), this would represent approximately $14 per year. 27. Bernstein (2015) also proposed a multiyear phase-in period, though with a lower fi nal FTT rate of 3 to 5 basis points. 28. Burman et al. (2016) estimated that a 10 basis point FTT on U.S. Treasury and Agency securities would increase federal borrowing costs by $390 billion over 10 years. 29. To prevent mutual funds from being used as a means of avoiding the FTT, by for example establishing a single-stock mutual fund with th e purpose of allowing trading in the security without incurring the FTT, this exemption could be limited to \"diversifi ed\" funds (as defi ned in the Investment Company Act), which cannot hold more than 5 percent of their assets in a single security and cannot hold more than 10 percen t of the securities of a single issuer. 30. Mutual funds would also have the ability to pass on any expected redemption-related FTT costs through redemption fees rather than absorbing them through higher fund expenses that aff ect the remaining investors. 31. In a simple linear tax model, Coehlo (2016b) fi nds that the overall implied revenue-maximizing FTT is 67 basis points, and that for high-frequency trading is lower, at 2.2 basis points. Th e lower 2.2 basis point rate is unlikely to generate meaningful levels of revenue, while the implied rate based on revenue considerations alone is likely to signifi cantly distort real economic activities. 32. Similarly, some have called for the FTT tax rate applied to debt and some derivative instruments to be scaled on the basis of time until maturity. While this gradation would add complexity, it also warrants further study. 33. Some countries also require fi nancial instruments to be \"stamped\" to demonstrate payment of the FTT. An unstamped document cannot be relied upon nor can it be used for legal purposes, such as registering a transfer of ownership. 34. Th is is analogous to how the United States treats tax withholdings for nonresidents with regard to payments on derivatives that are substantially equi valent to dividends on the underlying securities. 35. We also anticipate a period between enactment of the FTT and its initial implementation to allow the fi nancial services industry to establish the necessary systems and procedures. 36. \"U.S. person\" is defi ned in existing Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations for swap markets. 37. Unlike capital gains taxes, FTTs are not covered under U.S. tax treaties. 38. Th e plan analyzed by Pollin, Heintz, and Herndon (2018) assumed a 50 basis point FTT on equity securities, a 10 basis point rate on bond transactions, and 0.5 basis points on the notional value of derivatives transactions. TPC revenue estimates of the same plan are signifi cantly lower (i.e., $52 billion in the fi rst year, relative to the $220 billion estimate in Pollin, Heintz, and Herndon 2018). For details on the diff erences between the two estimates, see Nunns (2016). 39. We thank Chenxi Lu, Th ornton Matheson, and Eric Toder for providing estimates of the proposal using the Urban-Brooking Tax Policy Center Microsimulation Model. 40. As a point of comparison to other avenues to increase federal revenues, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that increasing income tax rat es on the two highest brackets 1 percentage point would raise $123 billion over 10 years, and increasing tax rates on capital gains and dividends 2 percentage points would raise $70 billion (Congressional Budget Offi ce 2018). 41. Th e dynamic estimates account for the following eff ects: taxpayers' behavioral responses, including reductions in transactions based on an elasticity estimate of 1.25; income and payroll tax off set; delay in reporting systems; ongoing capital gains revenue loss; and capital gains capitalization eff ect. 42. Another factor aff ecting the tax distribution is that high-income households are more likely to have investments in privately held businesses, w hich would not incur FTT costs because they are not regularly traded. TPC excluded investments in pr ivately held businesses an d real estate for the purposes of distributing the FTT tax burden. Antonio Weiss and Laura Kawano 186 43. It may be surprising that the distribution of the tax burden is not even more progressive than shown in table 5. Th ere are three main reasons for this: First, not all wealth is held in fi nancial assets. For example, some high-income households' pr inciple assets consist of real estate and/or privately held businesses that are not aff ected by the FTT. Th e distribution of total wealth is slightly more progressively distributed than that of fi nancial wealth: Th e top one percent hold 26 percent of total wealth, as contrasted with 23 percent of noncash fi nancial wealth. Second, noncash fi nancial assets is a broad measure, and there is considerab le variation in the distribution of its component assets. While bonds\u2014particularly tax-exempt bonds\u2014a nd directly held stock are distributed quite progressively, other components, such as pension and life insurance assets, are much less so. Th ird, income and wealth are imperfectly correlated. To illustrate, some high-income households hold little fi nancial wealth (e.g., young high-income households who have not saved much yet in their lifetimes) and some middle-income households have sizable fi nancial assets (e.g., retired households with assets that generate relatively little income in a given year). Th e distributional analysis includes these costs, distributed to households on the basis of their noncash fi nancial assets. 44. Th e average family in the middle-income decile has direct stock holdings of approximately $7,000 (calculation based on Federal Reserve 2017). 45. Th e mutual fund would have the ability to charge investors redemption fees to pass on the FTT costs associated with any necessary selling of securities. Trading in ETF shares would be subject to the FTT. 46. Calculation based on Federal Reserve (2017). 47. Th e small impacts on the middle class shown in the distributional analysis come from those middle- income households with larger asset holdings or those with substantial pension and insurance assets that would face indirect costs.

Th e proposal comes with several qualifi cations: the VAT should complement, not substitute for, new direct taxes on the wealth or income of affl uent households; to ensure the policy change is progressive, the VAT should be coupled with adjustments to government means-tested programs to account for price level changes, and with a universal basic income (UBI) program; to avoid having the VAT depress the economy, revenues should be used to raise aggregate demand in the short run and the Federal Reserve should accommodate the tax by allowing prices to rise. A 10 percent federal VAT that funded a UBI equal to 20 percent of the federal poverty line would be highly progressive (with net income rising among the bottom forty percent and not changing in the middle quintile) and would still raise more than 1 percent of GDP in net revenue. VATs are a proven success, existing in 168 countries. VATs have been proposed by both Democrats and Republicans in recen t years. Concerns about small businesses, vulnerable populations, and the states can be easily addressed. Introduction Th e future fi scal and economic health of the United States depends on its ability to increase revenues.1 With high and rising public debt, an aging population that will place increasing demands on federal spending, and a need for new investments in infrastructure, research and development, and human capital, the federal government requires more funding to improve its fi nances and promote future economic growth and opportunity. Recent fi scal actions that raised current and future budget defi cits, including the Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax William Gale, Brookings Institution and Urban-Brookings Tax Policy CenterWilliam Gale 192 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2018 and 2019, make these matters worse. One way to collect more revenue is to reform existing taxes. Instead, or in addition, policymakers could create new revenue sources. Th is chapter proposes a new progressive, national consumption tax: a broad-based, credit-invoice value-added tax (VAT), sometimes referred to as a \"goods and services\" tax. Th e most intuitive way to understand the VAT is that it is like a retail sales tax, but with tax revenue that is collected in parts at each stage of production rather than all at once at the retail level. 2 Similar to a tax imposed in New Zealand, this VAT would tax a broad base that includes items that other countries' taxes typically omit: education, health care, fi nancial services, and nonprofi ts. To maintain parity with the private sector, federal, state, and local government spending would be taxed too, but this taxation of government spending would not raise net revenues, because the federal government cannot raise net revenue by taxing itself and because the proposal would reimburse subnational governments for the VAT they pay. Coupled with a universal basic income that varies with family size and composition, the VAT can raise substantial amounts of revenue in a progressive fashion. Th e proposal comes with fi ve important provisions and considerations. First, the VAT proposed here is intended to work in conjunction with other, highly progressive policies, like an ongoing direct wealth tax, capital gains reforms, or other policy changes that raise taxes on well-to-do households. As noted throughout this volume, there are important reasons to raise tax burdens on high-income and high-wealth households relative to others, s o t h i s p r o p o s a l s h o u l d b e r e a d a s a c o m p l e m e n t to\u2014not a substitute for\u2014other ways to raise taxes on the rich. 3 Th is is because taxes on high- income and high-wealth households, by themselves, are not likely to raise suffi cient revenue to allow the federal government to control debt, invest in the economy, and provide payments to the elderly (Gale 2019). In addition, pairing a VAT with these policies is likely to make them more eff ective. One of the easiest ways for higher-income households to avoid wealth taxes or income taxes is to consume more\u2014an avenue that a VAT makes less attractive. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, in light of secular increases in income and wealth inequality, it is inappropriate to ask the middle class to pay the higher taxes a VAT entails without also enacting substantially higher levies on high-income and high-wealth households. Second, to ensure that the VAT is on balance a progressive reform, it should be coupled with several policies that relieve the burdens on low- and middle-income households. Means-tested government transfers should Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 193 be adjusted for any increase in the price level (including the VAT) so that the real aft er-tax value of these benefi ts remains unchanged. In addition, Congress should stipulate a one-time change in how Social Security benefi ts are calculated to counteract what would otherwise be an aft er-tax benefi t reduction imposed on new generations of benefi ciaries by the VAT. A VAT with these two adjustments is progressive\u2014it reduces aft er-tax income of lower-income households by a smaller proportion than it does for higher-income households. Th e reason is that protected forms of income\u2014Social Security and means-tested transfers\u2014constitute a much larger share of income for lower-income groups. Th is policy package can be made even more progressive by using a portion of VAT revenues to provide each household with a universal basic income (UBI) based on family size and composition. Th is benefi t would be provided through quarterly payments to each family, for an annual reimbursement equal to two times the poverty line times the consumption tax rate. For example, with a 10 percent VAT, a family of four would receive about $5,200 back each year, compensating them for taxes paid on about $52,000 of consumption. 4 Families that spend less than two times the poverty line would receive more from the UBI than they would pay in VAT. Families with higher spending would only face a net tax burden when they consume above two times the poverty line. Including the UBI, the VAT is remarkably progressive by conventional standards: aft er-tax income would rise by almost 17 percent in the lowest income quintile, remain virtually unchanged in the middle quintile, and fall by 5.5 percent among the top 1 percent of households. Th ird, to avoid the VAT depressing the economy in the short run, most or all of the revenues collected in the years immediately following enactment should be spent on programs that stimulate the economy. For example, revenue from a VAT (aft er the adjustments described above) could be used to expand the UBI, restructure or reduce other taxes, pay for health care ( B u r m a n 2 0 0 9 ) , f u n d w o r k i n c e n t i v e s ( B u r m a n 2 0 1 9 ) , b o o s t n e c e s s a r y government investments, or provide temporary stimulus, all of which would help off set any demand reduction from the introduction of the VAT. Over time, some of those uses could be scaled back so that revenues from the VAT could be used to reduce the federal debt. Fourth, in the enabling legislation, Congress should direct the Federal Reserve to accommodate the VAT by allowing the nominal price level to rise by the full extent of the tax. If the price level rises by less than this amount, some of the adjustment to a VAT would take place through declines in nominal wages, which could be a costly and lengthy process. William Gale 194 Fift h, while I am not wedded to a particular tax rate, I use a 10 percent federal VAT in the analysis below. If states converted their existing retail sales taxes to conform with a federal VAT base, they would need to set a VAT rate of 6.6 percent, on average, to raise current levels of revenue in a mann e r tha t is m o r e g e n e r o us t o th e bo tt o m 40 pe r ce n t o f th e in co m e distribution than current sales taxes. Th e average combined federal-state V A T , 1 6 . 6 p e r c e n t , w o ul d b e s i gn ifi cantly below the 2018 OECD average VAT rate of 19.3 percent. Taking these fi ve considerations into account, the broad-based credit- invoice VAT this chapter proposes would bring to the United States a progressive and growth-friendly version of the revenue source that so many other nations rely upon. America has never had a national broad-based consumption tax of any kind, but the VAT is the world's most common consumption tax, used by more than 160 countries, including every economically advanced nation except the United States. In 2016, consumption taxes raised just 3.7 percent of GDP in the United States, mainly through state and local sales taxes, compared with 10.5 percent in other OECD countries, mostly through VATs. 5 VATs are popular for many reasons. First, and most importantly, VATs raise a lot of money. Asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly said, \"Because that's where the money is\" (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2015). As a tax on a broad measure of consumption, VATs are \"where the money is\" in tax reform. In other OECD countries, VATs are the third largest revenue source, behind social security and personal income taxes. 6 A VAT initiated in 2020 at a 10 percent rate would raise $247 billion, or 1.1 percent of GDP, even aft er funding a UBI that provides families payments equal to the VAT rate times twice the poverty line. Over the course of 2020-29, the policy would raise $2.9 trillion. If a UBI were not implemented, the VAT would raise revenue by a whopping $842 billion in 2020, or about 3.8 percent of GDP. 7 Th e 10-year total is about $10 trillion. Th e revenue generated by a VAT would provide an enormous pool of resources to address social and economic problems. Second, VATs are consistent with an effi cient and prosperous economy. Future consumption is funded by existing wealth, future wages, or future excess returns on investments. As a result, a consumption tax eff ectively imposes a one-time implicit lump-sum tax on a broad measure of wealth existing at the time of implementation. Th e burden of this component of the VAT is imposed immediately upon enactment because the value of wealth changes. Th is outcome is easiest to see if the consumer price level, which includes the VAT, rises by the full VAT rate. In that case, existing Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 195 assets can then be exchanged for less aft er-tax consumption than before the V AT was imposed.8 Th e burden a VAT places on existing wealth avoids three key pitfalls of a d i r e c t w e a l t h t a x : Th e VAT's wealth tax is extremely effi cient because it is very diffi cult to avoid or evade; it does not require explicit valuation of particular assets; and it taxes excess returns, which is not distortionary, rather than taxing all returns, which is. But while this wealth tax is progressive by conventional standards, because the distribution of wealth is skewed toward the top, the burden imposed by the VAT is substantially less progressive than that of a direct wealth tax with a high exemption. While the burden of a VAT on existing wealth is imposed immediately upon enactment through a decline in the purchasing power of existing assets, the explicit tax payments arising from future consumption of existing wealth accrue only over potentially long periods. Still, the present value of long-term revenue from the burden a VAT imposes on wealth is at least equal to\u2014and may well exceed, under plausible assumptions\u2014the 10-year (undiscounted) revenue yield of the wealth tax proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren. A VAT also has important effi ciency advantages over other types of taxes. Because VATs do not distort saving, investment, or fi nancial decisions, they are more conducive to economic growth than income taxes or wealth taxes are. Because of the unique crediting structure that they employ, VATs are easier to administer and enforce than retail sales taxes. And by using border adjustments that remove taxes on exports but impose taxes on imports, VATs are consistent with other countries' tax systems and avoid creating distortions in international trade. Critics argue that a VAT could hurt small businesses, low-income households, the elderly, and state and local governments. Th ese concerns are either overblown or easily addressed: Th e United States should exempt small businesses from the tax as most countries do; the administrative burdens of taxing small businesses under a VAT may not be worth the revenue gains. Concerns about low-income and elderly households should be addressed by the UBI and by the adjustments to Social Security benefi t calculations and means-tested transfers described above. No state would have to convert its sales tax to a VAT, but states that convert to a base that conforms with a federal VAT could more eff ectively tax services and interstate consumer purchases and avoid taxing business purchases, all with reduced administrative costs. William Gale 196 Critics also assert that a VAT would increase government revenues and thus inappropriately raise government spending. Yet in European countries, VATs did not boost government spending much, even when long-term debt was not an issue. Instead, the vast share of VAT revenue went to reducing outdated or poorly working sales and turnover taxes (the latter defi ned as taxes on transactions of intermediate goods rather than on value added). Th e United States is most likely to adopt a VAT in the context of a long- term debt reduction agreement that would presumably also impose limits on spending. Fears about the United States adopting a VAT can be further assuaged by looking at Canada's experience. Th e Canadian VAT has features to provide progressivity, and it has not swelled the government. Some of the provinces have kept their previous sales taxes, and some have conformed their provincial tax base with the federal VAT; all of the provinces retain the power to set their own rates. So why don't we already have a VAT? More than 30 years ago Larry Summers summarized the VAT's political prospects by saying that \"liberals think it's regressive and conservatives think it's a money machine,\" predicting that policymakers will enact a VAT only when liberals realize that it is a money machine and conservatives realize that it is regressive (Rosen 1988). 9 Th ere is no better description of the political problem. But Summers' statement also holds the key to reaching a political accord. Although liberals fear it would be regressive, a VAT can be part of a progressive strategy. For example, European countries impose VATs but also spend more generously than the United States on social policy priorities like universal health care, paid family leave, assistance for low-income households, and investments in children. And though conservatives fear it's a money machine, the VAT is effi cient and can be part of a compromise with liberals that limits spending and highlights the need to pay for any new spending increases (as in Gale 2019). In recent years the VAT has received support from a variety of quarters. More than 20 years ago, leading legal scholar Michael Graetz proposed a VAT as part of a broader restructuring of the tax system, a proposal recently endorsed by Benjamin Cardin, the Democratic senator from Maryland (Graetz 1997, 2008, 2013; Cardin 2015). Numerous Republican political leaders\u2014including Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz\u2014have proposed that the United States adopt a VAT (though they do not call it that) as a way of reforming taxes (Ryan 2008; Paul 2015; Cruz Campaign 2015). Th e Domenici-Rivlin commission proposed a VAT (called a \"debt reduction sales tax\") for the purpose of paying down the federal debt (Debt Reduction Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 197 Task Force 2010). Th e key point is that\u2014regardless of how political leaders would like to use the revenue\u2014there is widespread agreement on the value o f the V A T : i t raises rev en ue in an effi cient, equitable, and administrable manner that is consistent with an open economy. As noted, I do not specify the use of VAT revenues, but to make sure the VAT does not restrict aggregate demand in the short run, a sensible approach would use the revenues to fund economic stimulus, government investment or tax reform, and would only phase in federal debt reduction over longer horizons. To motivate and justify the proposal for a VAT, the chapter proceeds as follows. Th e fi rst section discusses the overall fi scal challenge facing the country and why a VAT would be a constructive part of the solution. Th e second section provides background information on the history and workings of the VAT. Th e third section outlines a proposed VAT for the United States. Th e fourth section provides an economic evaluation of the VAT, elaborating on its properties as a tax on wealth and discussing its eff ects on revenue, growth, distribution, and tax administration. Th e fi ft h section addresses questions and concerns, including the money machine argument, the impact of a VAT on the states, the politics of a U.S. VAT, and the Canadian experience. The Challenge Th e justifi cation for a credit-invoice VAT is threefold: (a) the government needs to raise revenues as part of the response to the long-term fi scal outlook, (b) consumption taxes contain attractive features as sources of additional revenue, and (c) the credit-invoice VAT is advantageous relative to alternative consumption taxes. REVENUES AND THE LONG-TERM FISCAL OUTLOOK Under the most recent Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO 2019) projections, the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise steadily from 79 percent today\u2014already the highest in U.S. history except for a few years around World War II\u2014to about 143 percent in 2049, assuming that current laws remain in place (which also imply tax increases that are likely to be politically unrealistic and constrained spending growth). In a more realistic scenario that follows current policy, the debt will rise to 177 percent over that same period (Auerbach, Gale, and Krupkin 2019). 10 At that time, net interest payments, which peaked at 3.2 percent of GDP in 1991, would be 4.6 percent and 5.6 percent of GDP, respectively, under the two scenarios. Under either scenario, debt and interest payments will continue to rise relative to GDP aft er 2049. Th ese trends occur even though the projections assume that William Gale 198 over the next 30 years the economy will remain close to full employment and government interest rates will remain far below the output growth r a t e . Ri s i n g d e b t w i l l m a k e i t h a r d e r t o g r o w t h e e c o n o m y , b o o s t l i v i n g standards, deal with national security challenges, respond to recessions, address social needs, and maintain the country's status as a global leader. As a matter of accounting, debt is projected to rise because spending will increase faster than revenues. But this does not make rising debt a \"spending problem\" that must be addressed solely by spending cuts, for two reasons. First, much of the projected increase in spending as a share of the economy is due to rising net interest payments\u2014burdens created by defi cits from previous years. Th ese burdens are not obviously better borne by spending cuts than by revenue increases. Second, the rest of the spending increase is due to an aging population and rising health-care costs, which will place more demands on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Neither s o u r c e o f h i g h e r s p e n d i n g i s t h e r e s u l t o f n e w g o v e r n m e n t p r o g r a m s ; rising spending is simply policymakers' earlier commitments coming due, commitments that, to date, they have chosen not to fund with suffi cient tax revenues. In short, the debt problem is not either a spending problem or a tax problem any more than one side of the scissors does the cutting. Rather, the problem is the imbalance between spending and revenues. Addressing the debt challenge will require both slowing the spending trajectory and raising taxes. CONSUMPTION TAXES Consumption taxes in general\u2014and VATs in particular\u2014can, if properly designed, provide an impressive combination of substantial revenue, progressivity, and effi ciency. Policymakers and researchers oft en consider the tax system's revenue potential separately from its effi ciency or progressivity. Th e issues, however, are closely related. If the overall revenue from the tax system needs to rise, it becomes even more important that the new taxes be effi cient and progressive. Th e VAT can raise substantial amounts of revenue. Among OECD member countries in 2016, VATs were the third largest source of revenue behind the individual income tax and social security contributions and raised about 7 percent of GDP on average. Consumption taxes are effi cient, relative to other taxes. As discussed later in this chapter, introducing a consumption tax imposes an implicit lump-sum tax on wealth that existed before the introduction of the tax. Th is implicit Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 199 tax on existing wealth tax does not distort behavior, cannot be avoided or evaded, raises substantial revenue over time, and does not require that value be assessed (Altig et al. 2001; Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987). Unlike income taxes, consumption taxes do not distort the return on new saving or investment: they do not aff ect the decision to consume today or save for the future. Th ey also do not distort choices related to organizational form, d e b t o r e q u i t y fi n a n c i n g , o r d i v i d e n d p a y m e n t s . H o w e v e r , l i k e i n c o m e taxes, consumption taxes do encourage leisure (which is untaxed) at the expense of labor. Consumption taxes can be part of a progressive reform package, depending on the rate structure of the tax and the presence of off setting policies like the UBI proposed here or cuts to regressive payroll taxes. THE CREDIT-INVOICE VAT RELATIVE TO OTHER CONSUMPTION TAXES Consumption taxes come in many forms (see the appendix). Some are explicitly transaction-based (e.g., the credit-invoice VAT and the retail sales tax). Some are essentially personal consumption taxes\u2014income taxes with an exemption for net saving, such as the USA tax proposed in the 1990s by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM)\u2014that rely on the fact that all aft er-tax income is either consumed or saved. Some are streamlined business income taxes (e.g., a subtraction-method VAT). Others are a combination of cash-fl ow business taxes and personal taxes on wages (e.g., the \"fl at tax\" and the X-tax, described in the appendix). Th is chapter focuses on a credit-invoice VAT, which off ers signifi cant administrative and compliance advantages over other transaction-based taxes (such as the retail sales tax, as discussed further below). Th e credit-invoice VAT would also work well as a supplement to the existing tax system, whereas personal consumption taxes, streamlined business income taxes, and cash-fl ow business taxes are usually proposed as replacements for existing personal and corporate income taxes. In addition, the credit-invoice VAT is a proven revenue mechanism used in 167 countries worldwide. Only Japan uses a system similar to a subtraction-method VAT, and no country uses a large-scale retail sales tax, a fl at tax, an X-tax, or a tax similar to the USA tax. William Gale 200 VAT B a s ic s A business's \"value added\" is the diff erence between its gross sales and its purchases of goods and services from other businesses. It is equal to total worker compensation plus cash fl ow. Suppose a farmer grows wheat and sells it to a baker for $40. Th e baker turns the wheat into bread and sells it to consumers for $100. Th e baker's value added is $60\u2014the diff erence between sales and purchases. For simplicity, we will assume that the farmer has no input costs, so the farmer's value added is $40. Th e total of the values added at each stage of production is equal to the retail sale price of the good, in this case $100. Governments can tax value added in diff erent ways. (See box 1 for a brief history of VATs). In the credit-invoice method, each business pays the government the VAT collected on its sales minus a credit for the VAT it pays on its input purchases (see table 1). If the VAT were 10 percent in the previous example, 11 the farmer would charge the baker $44 overall, pay $4 in VAT to the government, and keep $40, which is equal to the farmer's value added. 12 Th e baker would charge consumers $110, pay $6 in VAT (the diff erence between the $10 the baker owes on sales and the $4 credit paid to TABLE 1.

History of Value-Added Taxes Th e VAT is a relatively new tax. While tariff s, excise taxes on alcohol, and other taxes have existed for centuries, the VAT was designed in the early 20th century and began to be implemented on a wide scale only about 50 years ago. Wilhelm von Siemens, a German businessman, designed the VAT to resolve problems that arose in implementing sales taxes. Independently and roughly contemporaneously, Th o m a s S . A d a m s , a n A m e r i c a n , c o n c e i v e d of the VAT as a better version of the corporate income tax. In p r a c t i c e , i n e c o n o m i c a l l y a d v a n c e d c o u n t r i e s , V A T s h a v e b e e n introduced largely as improved versions of consumption taxes, replacing excise, turnover, and retail sales taxes, rather than as replacements for the corporate income tax. Almost all advanced countries maintain separate corporate income taxes. Many European governments adopted VATs in the 1960s and 1970s, motivated by European Economic Community (EEC) directives requiring a harmonized VAT as a condition for entry into the European Union. Several Latin American governments also implemented VATs over this period. Starting in the late 1980s, several economically advanced non-EEC countries, including New Zealand (1986), Japan (1989), Canada (1991), South Africa (1991), Singapore (1994), Switzerland (1995), and Australia (2000), implemented VATs, as did many countries with developing economies. Th e VAT now exists in a vast majority of countries and in 2016 accounted for more than 20 percent of OECD tax revenue. Th e diff usion of the VAT was \"the most signifi cant development in the fi eld of taxation in the past 50 years,\" according to Sijbren Cnossen, a leading tax expert from Maastricht University in the Netherlands (Cnossen 2011, 34). William Gale 202 the farmer), and keep $60 ($110 minus $44 minus $6), which is equal to the baker's value added. Consumers pay $110 for the bread, and the government receives $10 in taxes. Consumer payments, tax revenues, and aft er-tax revenues received by each producer are the same under a 10 percent VAT as under a well-functioning 10 percent retail sales tax (table 1). The Proposal: Designing an American V AT An American VAT would retain the signal advantages of the tax\u2014revenue potential, effi ciency, and administrability\u2014and add progressivity to that list of qualities. Th e core elements of an American VAT would be as follows: a broad base, including essentially all consumption that is associated with explicit payments; a base that includes all government wages and purchases, with state and local government VAT payments rebated to them by the federal government; a standard rate that applies to all taxable purchases; an exemption for businesses with gross annual revenue below $200,000, although they would be allowed to opt in; adjustments to preserve the real value of federal means-tested transfers and Social Security benefi ts; and a UBI based on household size and composition. BASE Th e VAT should rest on the broadest consumption base possible. Focusing on consumption avoids distorting choices regarding saving, investment, organizational form, fi nancing, and dividend payouts. It also avoids having business taxes \"cascade\" with each stage of production, which would have the undesirable feature of more heavily taxing goods with more stages of production. Setting the base as broadly as possible has numerous attractive features. It reduces opportunities for tax avoidance and limits distortions in production and consumption. It reduces wasteful administrative eff orts to defi ne which products are taxable\u2014for example, whether a Halloween costume is clothing (which might be exempt) or a toy (which might not be Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 203 exempt). It reduces the need and expense for fi rms to allocate their costs between sales that are and are not subject to VAT. It also reduces political pressure to generate ever more exemptions. Nevertheless, almost all VATs exclude some goods or services, doing so in one of two ways: zero rating and exemption. When a retail good (food, for example) is zero rated, the seller does not have to pay taxes on the retail sale but still receives credits for the VAT paid on input purchases. Th is reduces the fi nal sale price of the good compared with what it would have been if the item were taxed at the standard rate. A business that is exempt does not pay tax on its sales, but in contrast to zero rating, it does not receive credits for the VAT it paid on inputs. Th is breaks the VAT's chain of credits and can end up raising prices, depending on how much of the value added was provided by input suppliers. Countries tend to zero rate particular goods with the intent of enhancing progressivity and tend to exempt goods that are hard to tax. VATs in the European Union typically exclude hospital and medical care, noncommercial activities of nonprofi ts, sporting services, cultural services (except radio and television), residential rents, fi nancial services, supply of land and buildings, and other items. As a result, European VATs tax less than 60 percent of overall consumption (OECD 2018). Th e y al s o d o n o t tax government purchases. In contrast, newer (second-generation) VATs\u2014such as in Australia and New Zealand\u2014tend to tax a broader base. In New Zealand, for example, the base includes essentially all consumption and government spending. Taxing Consumption As noted, the VAT should apply to as much consumption as possible. A p p l yi n g th e V A T t o f o o d c o n s um e d a t h o m e i s p arti c ul ar l y i m p o rt an t . Food accounts for a large share of overall spending and, of course, a larger share of the budget of low-income households than of high-income households (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2019). Still, taxing food makes sense for several reasons. First, from an administrative perspective, zero r a ti n g f o o d c o n s um e d a t h o m e l e a d s t o diffi cult line-drawing situations. Table 2 provides examples from the United Kingdom's VAT. Second, from an equity perspective, taxing food and providing universal payments based on household size and composition is more progressive than zero rating f o o d , b e c a u s e f o o d e x p e n d i t u r e s r i s e i n a b s o l u t e t e r m s a s i n c o m e r i s e s , even though they decline as a share of spending (Benge, Pallot, and Slack 2013). Th ird, from a political perspective, if the tax applies to a necessity like food, policymakers will be hard-pressed to make a case for giving other goods preferential treatment. William Gale 204 Education expenses, to which the proposed VAT would apply, are another thorny issue. Th e case for excluding education is that it is an investment and so could plausibly be excluded from a VAT. On the other hand, not all education expenditures are themselves investments (Gong et al. 2019). Zero rating education expenses would create inevitable line-drawing problems, especially since the VAT does not necessarily give preferential treatment to other consumption that supports human capital\u2014for example, buying a book or an educational toy for a child. In addition, higher-income households consume a disproportionately large share of education, so zero rating its associated expenses would be regressive. 13 Other policies already subsidize education, so making these policies more generous (with revenues from a VAT), in ways that are targeted to social objectives, would be a better way of supporting human capital investments than excluding education from a VAT. Th e VAT should apply to the net price of education, not the sticker price. In many cases students receive considerable discounts in the form of fi nancial aid and grants from universities. Taxing the sticker price would ignore the heavy eff ective price discounts many students receive. Similar to the treatment of nonprofi ts in the U nited Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, the activities of nonprofi t organizations would be subject to the VAT. Although these organizations are exempt from income taxation in those countries and in the United States, that exemption in itself is not justifi cation for exemption from a VAT (Gendron 2011; Morris TABLE 2.

Internal Manual, VAT Food 2018.Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 205 2011). Preferential status under a VAT would generate a strong incentive for individuals to shift their consumption to nonprofi ts, creating more regulatory and line-drawing diffi culties. Most V AT s exempt some or all fi nancial services. Many fi nancial services are provided without explicit fees (e.g., checking account services oft en are paid for through lower interest rates on the accounts), making it diffi cult to calculate value added. Exemption of fi nancial services, however, creates the usual line-drawing problems and makes it diffi cult for fi rms to allocate costs between exempt and nonexempt transactions. In addition, it overtaxes business-to-business transactions, since it breaks the VAT crediting chain, and it undertaxes business-to-consumer transactions because it imposes no tax on the value added for the consumer (Merrill 2011). To the extent that the creation of fi nancial services uses real resources, those services should be taxed under a VAT, just like any other activity (Auerbach and Gordon 2002). And, for political reasons, if the VAT applies to food, it needs to apply to fi nancial services. New approaches and technology have made it more straightforward to tax fi nancial services, so these methods should be used to assess VAT in the United States. 14 Several countries, including South Africa and Australia, already tax a signifi cant share of fi nancial transactions through a VAT. Alternatively, many countries use a fi nancial transactions tax\u2014which, as a tax on gross turnover, is conceptually diff erent from a VAT\u2014as is proposed by Weiss and Kawano (2020) in this volume and discussed by Burman et al. (2016). Because a VAT is collected when consumption transactions occur, it cannot easily be applied to consumption that occurs without explicit payments. For example, people who own their home do not pay themselves explicit rent. As a result, most VATs do not tax the implicit rent that owner-occupiers pay themselves. Instead, for administrative reasons, VATs typically adopt the prepayment approach: the VAT is applied to the purchases of new owner- occupied housing (which occurs when the house is sold from a business to a household, but not when a household sells a house to another household). Any improvements to owner-occupied housing should also be subject to a V A T . T o a v o i d d i s t o r t i n g h o u s e h o l d s ' c h o i c e t o b e a n o w n e r - o c c u p i e r versus a renter, the VAT should exempt rental payments as well, and instead charge VAT on the purchases of new housing meant for rental use as well as improvements to rental housing. As discussed later, use of the prepayment method means that when a VAT is imposed, the existing housing stock is excluded from the tax. Th e same logic applies to the existing stock of nonhousing durables\u2014cars, boats, furniture, collectibles, and so on. Th e benefi ts derived from durables William Gale 206 that already exist would not be taxed under the VAT, but purchases of new assets would be taxed. Taxing Government To maintain price parity with the private sector, the VAT would tax federal purchases of goods and services and employee compensation. Th is avoids creating the (incorrect) appearance that the federal government can make purchases more cheaply than the private sector. However, taxation of federal purchases would not raise any net revenue, since it would raise federal spending by the exact amount that it raises revenues (Gale 2005). Th e VAT would tax state and local government purchases of goods and services and employee compensation, again to maintain parity with the private sector. But because the federal VAT should not burden people in their role as state and local taxpayers, it should include a rebate for VAT paid by state and local governments. As a result, taxing state and local governments' purchases and employee compensation would not raise any net revenue. 15 Th e VAT would also exempt state and local sales taxes, to avoid cascading. Border Tax Adjustments Th e tax should be administered on a destination basis, as is standard p r a cti c e in th e r e s t o f th e w o r l d. Th at is, it should tax imports and zero rate exports. Th ese border tax adjustments (BTAs) allow the VAT to operate across countries in a harmonized manner. Contrary to popular belief, BTAs do not subsidize exports (Slemrod 2011). Instead, they allow VATs to function as consumption taxes rather than production taxes. Th ey impose the same tax on all goods consumed in the host country and exclude all goods not consumed in the host country, regardless of where the goods are produced. Figure 1 shows that BTAs convert what would be a tax on domestic production to a tax on domestic consumption. With no BTA, the VAT would tax all goods produced domestically, as shown in the fi rst row of the fi gure. Th e BTA eliminates the tax on exports and adds a tax on imports. Th is results in the VAT taxing all goods consumed domestically, as shown in the fi rst column. Recent policy discussions about replacing the corporate income tax with a destination-based cash-fl ow tax (which is shown in the appendix to be simply a subtraction-method VAT that also allows deductions for wages) created controversy. One issue was whether the nominal exchange rate would adjust fully. However, if the Federal Reserve fully accommodates a VAT by allowing prices to rise, the equilibrium nominal exchange rate Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 207 remains unchanged, leaving cross-border transactions unaff ected. A second concern was that exporters would receive large net subsidies under the destination-based cash-fl ow tax. In contrast, under the VAT, exporters would not be able to deduct wages, so virtually all exporters would have positive value added and be liable for tax. 16 Small Businesses Most countries exempt some small businesses from value-added taxation but allow them to register if they choose to ( Gale, Gelfond, and Krupkin 2016). Th i s i s p a r t l y b e c a u s e s m a l l - b u s i n e s s o w n e r s f o r m a p o w e r f u l political constituency and partly because the administrative costs of taxing small businesses are high relative to the revenue they generate. Although the defi nition varies, a small business is usually defi ned by gross revenues below a certain level, ranging from close to zero to almost $120,000 among OECD countries in 2018. Because the optimal exemption threshold trades off administrative costs and revenue earned, the higher the VAT rate, the lower the exemption threshold should be (Keen and Mintz 2004). Th e logic supporting this conclusion is that the expected VAT revenue rises as the tax rate rises, while compliance costs for businesses stay constant as the rate rises. For example, Brashares et al. (2014) estimate that the optimal threshold would be $200,000 under a 10 percent VAT and would fall to $90,000 under a 20 percent VAT. Th at exemption would be higher than in most other countries, but the 10 percent rate would be lower than in most other countries.FIGURE 1.

It reduces fi rms' compliance costs and taxes owed on sales but eliminates their ability to claim the VAT they pay on input purchases (and receive accompanying rebates from the government). An exemption may also reduce the demand for a business's product if it sells to other businesses, since other companies prefer to buy their inputs from fi rms that are in the VAT system so that they can claim credits for the tax es th ey p a y .

Finally, an exemption may create increased tax avoidance opportunities. Nevertheless, a 10 percent VAT should provide an exemption for companies with gross revenue under $200,000 and allow them to opt in if they wish. Estimates indicate that this exemption level would save 43 million businesses from having to fi le VAT if they chose not to (Brashares et al. 2014). THE STANDARD RATE Th e VAT should have a single standard rate that applies to all purchases under the VAT. European countries oft en have a variety of preferential rates, a practice that experts have described as \"increasingly quaint\" (Crawford, Keen, and Smith 2010). Standard VAT rates vary substantially across countries. In the 35 OECD member countries apart from the United States, the average standard rate in 2018 was 19.3 percent but varied widely\u2014from 5 percent in Canada (not counting provincial VATs) to 27 percent in Hungary. Having a standard rate on all goods and services has several advantages. Taxing diff erent goods at diff erent rates creates opportunities for avoidance, raises administrative costs, and would create an endless stream of arguments in favor of subsidizing additional goods. In contrast, taxing everything at the same rate may miss some opportunities to moderately improve the effi ciency of the tax code under ideal circumstances, but it will prove fairer and simpler and will reduce avoidance. 17 SUBSIDIES TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEANS-TESTED TRANSFERS Th e VAT will drive a wedge between wages and prices equal to the size of the tax. Either nominal wages will fall, prices will rise, or some combination of the two will occur. Either way, real wages will fall. (As discussed further below, the preferred outcome would be for the Federal Reserve Board to accommodate the VAT and allow prices to rise by the full extent of the tax Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 209 so that nominal wages would not have to fall, thus avoiding the wrenching macroeconomic consequences of declining nominal wages). Higher VAT-inclusive prices will reduce the value of means-tested federal benefi ts. To avoid this unintended reduction in benefi ts, Congress should stipulate that those benefi ts would be adjusted upward to maintain their real purchasing power. Th e drop in real wages (i.e., the fact that consumer prices inclusive of the V A T will r i s e r e l a ti v e t o w a g e s ) will al s o h a v e un i n t e n d e d c o n s e q u e n c e s for Social Security. Each birth-year cohort's real Social Security benefi ts are proportional to the real value of the National Average Wage Index in the year that the cohort turns 60. Th us, without further adjustments, the proposed VAT would cut real benefi ts for cohorts younger than age 60 at the time the tax was implemented. To maintain real benefi ts, Congress should require the Social Security Administration to make a one-time adjustment to the National Average Wage Index to off set the reduction caused by the VAT (Carroll and Viard 2012). UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME Almost all countries implement progressive adjustments by providing product-specifi c s u b s i d i e s ( e . g . , b y z e r o r a t i n g f o o d o r u t i l i t i e s ) . 18 Since these items represent a greater share of the budget for low-income families than for high-income families, zero rating these goods makes the tax more progressive than it otherwise would be. Th e eff ect on progressivity, though, is weaker than it could be, because high-income families spend more in absolute terms on these items than low-income families do. A per-person or per-family allowance more eff ectively targets the funds toward low-income households. In the proposal, each family would receive a UBI, paid quarterly and equal to the VAT rate multiplied by twice the poverty line. A family that consumed less than twice the poverty line would thus receive a net benefi t under this proposal. A family that consumed at twice the poverty line would pay no net tax once the VAT and UBI are taken into account. Families with higher income would face net tax burdens, but only in proportion to the amount of their consumption above the poverty line. Th e UBI would vary by family size (as does the poverty line) and be about $5,200 for a family of four. Th e average UBI across all households would be just over $3,400 per year.William Gale 210 THE NET TAX BASE Table 3 shows the calculation of the VAT eff ective tax base.19 Starting from aggregate consumption expenditures, the base is adjusted to refl ect the prepaymen t status of housing. No adjustmen t is needed to accommodate t h e p r e p a y m e n t s t a t u s o f d u r a b l e s o r c o l l e c t i b l e s b e c a u s e a g g r e g a t e consumption expenditures already include new purchases of those items and exclude benefi t s ( i . e . , \" c o n s u m p t i o n s e r v i c e s \" ) t h a t fl ow from those existing assets. Th e eff ective tax base\u2014the base available to generate net VAT revenue\u2014is reduced by excluding government spending on health care (which is part of consumption), given that the federal government cannot raise money by taxing itself. Further adjustments are made for state and local sales taxes on fi nal consumption, the small business exemption, avoidance, evasion, and miscellaneous factors. Th is leaves an aggregate eff ective tax base of $9.8 trillion, which equals about 64 percent of aggregate consumption or 44 percent of GDP. TABLE 3.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS Table 4 shows that, with adjustments for Social Security and means-tested transfers, and with a UBI equal to the VAT rate times twice the poverty line, the VAT would raise $247 billion in 2020 or about 1.1 percent of GDP. Over the 2020-29 period the VAT would generate about $2.9 trillion in revenues. If the UBI were cut in half, the VAT would raise $545 billion in 2020 and $6.5 trillion by the end of 2029 (not shown). With no UBI, the VAT would still be progressive (because of the protection of real Social Security benefi ts and means-tested transfers, discussed below) and would raise $842 billion in revenue in 2020, rising to $10.0 trillion over the next decade. 20 THE WEALTH TAX COMPONENT OF A VAT A consumption tax imposes a burden on wealth that exists at the time the tax is introduced. Households fi nance their consumption from one of three sources: existing wealth, future earnings, and returns on future TABLE 4.

Note: The proposal would introduce a VAT of 10 percent and provide a rebate in the form of a universal basic income for each household equal to 10 percent times twice the federal poverty level. The analysis shows the long-run impact on revenues and spending at 2020 levels of income and consumption. The analysis assumes that the Federal Reserve allows consumer prices to rise and that federal cash transfer bene ts are increased to maintain real purchasing power.William Gale 212 investments.21 Th us, one component of a pure consumption tax is a tax on all pre-existing wealth, which will be liable for the tax whenever it is used for consumption. Crucially, the consumption tax is capitalized immediately into the value of assets, even if it is paid to the government over a potentially lengthy period. By lowering the aft er-tax income stream generated by an asset existing at the time the tax is introduced, the consumption tax causes an immediate reduction in its real price. 22 Th e easiest way to understand this eff ect is to assume that, aft er the implementation of a consumption tax, the price level rises by the full extent of the tax. Th e n e x i s t i n g w e a l t h i s w o r t h l e s s ; a d e c r e a s e i n w e a l t h w i l l translate into less consumption in the future. For example, if a 10 percent tax on all consumption raised the consumer price level by 10 percent, it would reduce the value of existing wealth by 9.09 percent (10 divided by 110). (In contrast, if the price level remained constant, the entire burden would fall on equity holders and show up as a nominal decline in equity values; the value of nominally denominated debt would not change.) But, as noted, the proposed VAT would only tax consumption associated with explicit transactions. Under the proposed prepayment approach described above, a VAT would not tax the consumption services that households obtain from existing owner-occupied housing, rental housing, durable goods, or collectibles, though it would tax new purchases (and improvements) of these items. As a result, the VAT would impose an implicit one-time lump-sum tax, not on all pre-existing wealth, but rather on pre-existing wealth not held in housing, durables, or collectibles. Th is component of the VAT has enormously positive properties (see box 2). A lump-sum tax on the relevant wealth raises signifi cant amounts of revenue. It is likely to create minimal distortions, avoidance, evasion, and deadweight loss. Because it is not imposed directly, it does not require assessments of the value of specifi c items of wealth. And it is extremely progressive, given the unequal distribution of existing wealth. 23 LONG-RUN EFFICIENCY AND GROWTH It is hard to think of a tax that could raise as much revenue as a VAT and have better effi ciency eff ects, except perhaps for other forms of a consumption tax. Th e implicit lump-sum tax on pre-existing wealth (other than housing and durables) is one reason: a one-time tax on existing wealth can raise considerable revenue without economic distortions (Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987). 24 More generally, a VAT that is levied uniformly over time on all noninvestment goods and services has several key attributes. It does not distort relative prices or consumer choices among taxed goods, nor does Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 213 BOX 2. Comparing a V AT to a Direct Wealth Tax Th is chapter views the VAT as a complement, not a substitute, for direct taxes on the well-to-do, such as the wealth tax proposed b y W a r r e n ( 2 0 1 9 ) o r d i s c u s s e d i n S a e z a n d Z u c m a n ( 2 0 1 9 a ) . Compared with these other taxes, the VAT has Still, comparing the one-time wealth tax embodied in the VAT to an annual wealth tax on extremely wealthy households can help inform the debate. Th e VAT's implicit wealth tax has several obvious diff erences from direct wealth taxes. First, the VAT does not require explicit valuation of assets. Second, the wealth tax imposed by the VAT is essentially a lump-sum tax and would be diffi cult to avoid. Th ird, the VAT burdens future excess returns, whereas the direct wealth tax burdens the normal return in addition to excess returns (Guvenen et al. 2019). Fourth, the wealth tax imposed by the VAT would be quite progressive, imposing 21 percent of the burden on the top 0.1 percent of households, 70 percent on the top 5 percent, and 93 percent of the burden on the top quintile. 25 But the wealth tax component of the VAT would still be far less progressive than a tax on individual wealth above $40.6 million, which would be paid only by households in the top 0.1 percent of the wealth distribution. 26 Th e revenue diff erences between the two taxes are also of interest. Th e lump-sum wealth tax component of the VAT would fall on all wealth other than existing owner-occupied housing, rental housing, durable goods, and collectibles. A lower bound of the value of such wealth can be obtained by summing the value of fi nancial assets and privately held businesses and subtracting associated debt\u2014about $70 trillion in 2019. 27 Applying a 15 percent adjustment for evasion and avoidance (which is probably an overestimate, due to the diffi culty of escaping a VAT), the base would be about $60 trillion. Since the VAT would apply to about 64 percent of consumption, the eff ective base would be about $38 trillion. Th e VAT would impose the wealth tax at the rate of consumption taxation (10 percent), generating about $3.8 trillion in revenue in William Gale 214 present value. Th is is almost exactly equal to the (undiscounted) 10-year revenue gain, $3.75 trillion, reported by Senator Warren's campaign for her wealth tax (Warren 2019), though estimates for this aspect of the VAT and the wealth tax are both uncertain. 28 Comparing the long-term revenue of a VAT and Senator Warren's wealth tax is not simple. Th e burden on wealth from a VAT would be a one-time source of revenue but would be paid over a potentially extremely lengthy period. In contrast, estimates of the present value of the revenue from a wealth tax as described in Saez an d Zucman ( 20 1 9a, 20 1 9b ) o r p ro posed b y W arr en ( 20 1 9 ) co ul d generate a wide range of values, depending on the assumed growth rate of the economy and the appropriate rate of discount. Th us, while the present value of the burden on wealth from the VAT is about 19 times the initial annual revenue collected from the wealth taxes described above, it is more diffi cult to compare their long- term relative revenue yields. it aff ect household saving choices or business investment, organizational, fi nancing, or payout choices. But as with income and payroll taxes, the VAT distorts household labor supply choices because it creates a wedge between what one earns and how much consumption one can aff ord. A V A T is designed to operate in an increasingly globalized world. Border adjustability is consistent with world trade agreements and other countries' practices and would not disrupt the global supply chains that modern corporations rely on. Evidence suggests that the VAT does not reduce trade fl ows (Benartzi and Tazhitdinova 2018). Th e eff ects of a VAT on long-term economic growth depend, of course, on how the revenues are used, and thus quantitative estimates are beyond the scope of this chapter. One use of revenues is to partially replace the income tax. A large literature has addressed this topic, showing positive but generally small long-run eff ects, especially once personal exemptions and transition relief are included (see Altig et al. 2001). Huntley, Prisinzano, and Ricco (2019) use the Penn Wharton Budget Model to estimate that a 1 percent VAT, on a base somewhat smaller than that proposed in this chapter, with a refundable tax credit that is substantially smaller than the UBI proposed here, and applied to defi cit reduction, would raise GDP by 0.1 percent by 2030 and by 0.8 percent by 2050. More generally, higher tax revenues need not reduce growth: neither time series analysis nor cross-Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 215 section samples suggest a strong association between tax revenue levels and growth rates.29 SHORT-RUN EFFECTS Imposing a VAT would likely depress consumption, at least temporarily ( Al m a n d E l - G a n a i n y 2 0 1 2 ; C a r r o ll , C l i n e , a n d N e u b i g 2 0 1 0 ) . A s n o t e d , it may therefore be appropriate, in the short run, to use VAT revenues t o f u n d p r o g r a m s t h a t g e n e r a t e d e m a n d i n t h e e c o n o m y t o t h e g r e a t e s t extent through stimulus payments, government investments, or reform and restructuring of existing taxes. Over the longer term, as the economy adjusts, the revenues could be used for debt reduction. An alternative policy not proposed here but worth considering is phasing in the VAT, for example, starting at a 5 percent tax rate and then raising the rate one percentage point a year until it reaches 10 percent. A phase-in would raise the price of consumption gradually over time, giving people and businesses time to adjust their plans and incentives to accelerate consumption spending (to avoid higher tax rates in subsequent years). Th e increased consumption could provide direct stimulus to the economy, and the funds could also be used to stimulate the economy further (Gale 2019). If the VAT were to replace an equal-yield retail sales tax, the price level would be a nonissue. However, a VAT created in the absence of other policy changes would drive a wedge between wages and prices: either prices would go up or wages would go down (Gale 2005). Monetary policy, presumably, will determine whether the adjustment occurs through nominal wages or prices. Congress should stipulate that the monetary authorities should accommodate the VAT and allow for a one-time increase in the consumer price level (which includes the VAT) equal to the VAT rate. If instead, the Federal Reserve aims to keep consumer prices constant before and aft er the VAT is created, wages will (eventually) fall by the VAT rate, which would likely create signifi cant adjustment costs and job losses. 30 Implementing a one-time or gradual price level adjustment to accommodate the introduction of the VAT should not create continuing infl ation. Indeed, the presence of an additional revenue source would reduce the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will need to monetize defi cits. 31William Gale 216 LONG-TERM DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS As noted, the VAT is a combination of a non-distorting tax on (most) pre- existing wealth and future supernormal returns (that is, returns above the normal rate prevailing in the economy) and a distortionary tax on labor income. As a result, the burden of the VAT will change over time, as the i m p l i c i t t a x o n w e a l t h i s e v e n t u a l l y p a i d o ff . I focus on the long-term distributional eff ects, essentially aft er the tax on wealth has been fully paid. In practice, it would take a long time to reach this situation, so the results should be thought of as bounding the long-term distributional eff ects. In the lengthy period before the wealth tax revenues are fully collected, the proposal will be more progressive than shown below, because taxes on pre- existing wealth will continue to be paid and because pre-existing wealth is clearly distributed more unevenly than wages, which are much larger than supernormal profi ts. In the long term, aft er the initial period of adjustment, a consumption tax's burden falls on wages and on supernormal returns to capital (that is, it exempts the normal return to capital). In contrast, an income tax falls on wages, the normal return, and supernormal returns. As a result, when the rate structure is held constant, a VAT is slightly less progressive than an income tax and more progressive than a payroll tax (Gentry and Hubbard 1996). To bound the long-term distributional eff ects of the VAT, I follow Urban- Brookings Tax Policy Center standard protocol. Households are classifi ed according to their annual expanded cash income. 32 Table 5 shows that the VAT without a UBI, with adjustments for Social Security benefi ts and means-tested transfers, is somewhat progressive. Aft er-tax income falls by 3.7 percent in the bottom quintile versus 6.1 percent in the top quintile. Th e reason for the smaller decrease for low- income households is that a large fraction\u2014more than one-third\u2014of their income is in the form of Social Security benefi ts or means-tested transfers and thus is protected from the VAT. Under this specifi cation, the bottom quintile pays about 3 percent of the overall tax, while the top quintile pays more than half of all VAT payments. Th e middle quintile bears signifi cant net tax burdens in this specifi cation: aft er-tax income falls by 5.3 percent. Th e results become sharply more progressive in the presence of a UBI set at the VAT rate times the poverty level times two. In this case, the bottom quintile sees an increase in aft e r - t ax i n c o m e o f alm o s t 1 7 p e r c e n t , w h il e the top quintile faces a reduction in aft er-tax income of 4.7 percent. Th e top quintile bears more than 100 percent of the tax\u2014142 percent, to be Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 217 precise. With the UBI, the households in the middle quintile are essentially unaff ected on average\u2014their aft er-tax income is virtually unchanged.33 A lingering concern is that imposing a VAT would hurt low- or moderate- income elderly households. In practice, however, to the extent that a VAT raises prices, low-income elderly households will not be aff ected very much.

Distributional results (not shown) indicate that both the VAT and the VAT with the UBI are progressive among elderly groups, and that the net burden imposed on elderly households by the VAT plus UBI is essentially zero. Th us, we can inoculate the low-income elderly from the burden of a consumption tax while increasing the burden on the high-income elderly, who can more easily aff ord it. TAX ADMINISTRATION Designing, administering, and enforcing a VAT and issuing regulations would create new burdens for government. It would create new compliance costs for taxpayers as well, but they would likely be far smaller than those associated with the income tax, especially if the VAT has a broad base and taxes all items at the same rate (Bickley 2012). Firms already collect the information needed to fi le VAT (sales minus input purchases) in the normal operation of business. A VAT's chain of crediting has administrative advantages over retail sales taxes because it creates a natural audit trail. Under the VAT, in a transaction between two businesses, the seller knows that the buyer is reporting the transaction to claim a credit, so the seller has more incentive to report the transaction and pay its tax. In contrast, a retail sales tax contains no similar incentive to report transactions. 34 A retailer responsible for sending its collected sales tax revenue to the government knows that the government may not have a record of the transaction. Also, the retailer cannot always tell whether a buyer is a consumer who should pay the tax or a business that should not\u2014and has little incentive to fi n d o u t . I f th e r e t a i l e r d o e s not impose a sales tax on consumer purchases, it commits tax evasion. If the retailer imposes a tax on business purchases, the tax \"cascades,\" building up over successive stages of production, raising and distorting prices, depending on the number of stages of production. Th e VAT avoids cascading by providing a credit for taxes paid. Lastly, when evasion occurs at the retail level, all tax revenue on the sale is lost under a retail sales tax, whereas under a VAT, only the tax on value added by the retailer is lost. 35 As a result, most countries, states, and localities have found that retail sales tax rates of 10 percent or higher are not enforceable. All of this helps explain why so many countries have replaced their sales and turnover taxes with VATs (Ta n z i 19 95). 36 Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 219 VATs are still subject to avoidance and evasion, of course, but these opportunities are limited in a broad-based, single-rate tax. VAT (and sales tax) lore is full of colorful examples of tax avoidance created by zero rating and exemptions. 37 Underpayment in a VAT can arise from many sources, including under-reported sales (although this is a bigger problem with a retail sales tax for the reasons noted), misclassifi cation of goods (when rates vary), tax collected but not remitted to the government, and false claims for VAT credits or refunds. 38 In European countries, where open borders are a top priority for non-tax reasons, a phenomenon called carousel fraud is a signifi cant problem. It occurs when a good is imported, then is sold domestically by a business that collects VAT and vanishes, and lastly is exported. Th e fraud exploits the fact that exports are zero rated and import taxes are not due immediately upon importation. 39 Carousel fraud is most common with high-value goods sold across borders, such as cell phones and computer chips, and with intangible goods, such as carbon credits and cloud computing (European Parliament 2018). 40 Th e adoption of a VAT in the United States would likely not see rampant carousel fraud. International trade is less important here: in 2016, imports and exports summed to 26 percent of GDP in the United States, compared with 84 percent of GDP on average for members of the European Union (OECD 2019). In addition, the United States does not prioritize having open borders the way the European Union does. Several proposed administrative solutions to carousel fraud could easily be adopted by the United States (e.g., making exports zero rated only aft er the tax has been collected on the import, or not allowing a good to clear customs until taxes have been paid). 41 Th e overall evasion rate for VATs appears to be lower than for income taxes but varies widely among countries. In 2017, unpaid tax liabilities were about 11 percent of total VAT liability in the European Union, varying within member states from 0.6 percent in Cyprus to 35.5 percent in Romania (Center for Social and Economic Research 2019). Th e evasion rate would likely be signifi cantly lower under the proposed VAT in the United States both because of the broad-based, single-rate structure and because of the v a s t l y l o w e r p r e v a l e n c e o f c a r o u s e l f r a u d , w h i c h a c c o u n t s f o r 2 9 t o 4 4 percent of all VAT evasion in the European Union (European Parliament 2018). Finally, businesses under a VAT essentially serve as unpaid tax collectors (Robinson and Saviano 2011). Th ey could be compensated for these services with a small tax credit.William Gale 220 Questions and Concerns 1. Will a VAT fuel growth of government? Some conservatives and libertarians fear that a VAT will fuel the growth of government. Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist says, \"VAT is a French word for 'big government'\" (Cassidy 2005). According to Daniel Mitchell, a conservative tax commentator, giving policymakers a VAT would be like \"giving keys to a liquor store to a bunch of alcoholics\" (Mitchell 2010). Critics argue that the VAT is a \"hidden tax\" buried in the price of a good and that policymakers could raise the rate without public awareness. In fact, some evidence shows that policymakers can more easily raise rates o n hi dden taxes, an d V A T s ha v e been \"hi dden \" in so me co un tries in the past (Finkelstein 2009). But they do not need to be hidden. American state sales taxes are reported visibly on receipts, and there has been no massive expansion of such taxes over the years. Policymakers should require that American VAT charges be reported clearly on receipts, as is the practice in Canada, France, and other countries currently. A related concern is that the creation of a VAT will raise revenues (the tax becomes a \"money machine\"), encouraging excessive government spending. Th e argument, essentially, is that the VAT is too effi cient, raising revenue with such minimal economic distortion and administrative costs that it prompts the public to demand higher revenue and higher spending ( M i t c h e l l 2 0 1 1 ) . C o n s e r v a t i v e c r i t i c s f e a r t h a t s u c h s p e n d i n g w o u l d be damaging and prefer that the process of taxing and spending be less effi cient. Th e r e c o r d l a r g e l y b e l i e s c o n c e r n s t h a t V A T s h a v e f u e l e d s i g n i fi cantly higher revenue levels. Although overall revenues have risen signifi cantly in European countries with VATs, VATs do not seem to be the main reason. For example, fi gure 2 shows that tax revenues in OECD countries have risen substantially over time from 24.9 percent of GDP in 1965 to 34 percent of GDP in 2016. But revenue as a share of GDP from all consumption taxes (including VATs, retail sales taxes, and excise taxes, among others) has risen by only 1.6 percentage points over the same period. So while VAT revenue as a share of GDP has risen by 6.1 percentage points, it has been largely off set by a 4.5 percentage point average decline in revenue as a share of GDP from other forms of consumption tax. 42 In formal econometric analysis, Keen and Lockwood (2006, 925) fi nd that the \"association between the presence of a VAT and total tax revenue is not simple, is not always statistically signifi cant . . . and may in any event Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 221 be small.\" Th ey do not fi nd evidence that a V AT directly causes growth of government. Th ey point out that any eff ect of the VAT on total government spending has been diluted substantially by countries choosing to use VAT revenues to reduce other taxes. In addition, some evidence suggests that the causation runs the other way: the public's demand for higher spending fuels demand for a VAT, an effi cient revenue source (Lee, Kim, and Borcherding 2013). Th us, the OECD countries' experiences with a VAT do not suggest that the VAT causes sustained growth in government spending. Th e context for implementing a VAT in the United States\u2014namely, that the long-term fi scal shortfall facing the country necessitates tax increases\u2014 makes it even more unlikely that an American VAT would simply boost spending. To be fair, some evidence suggests that the more revenue the government has, the higher spending will be (Becker and Mulligan 2003). But U.S. history suggests that the opposite is more oft en the case. Every major tax cut of the past 60 years was accompanied or followed by an increase in spending, not a reduction. 43 In contrast, the budget deals enacted in 1990 and 1993 raised taxes and cut spending at the same time. So, in fact, U.S. policymakers tend to cut taxes and increase spending simultaneously; they also tend to raise taxes and cut spending simultaneously (Bartlett 2007; Gale and Orszag 2004; Romer and Romer 2009). Th us, when policymakers are ready to address the long-term fi scal challenge and create a VAT, they will likely couple it with spending cuts. FIGURE 2.

How would a VAT aff ect the states? A national VAT would have signifi cant implications for the sales taxes on which most states and many localities rely, but that is a feature, not a bug. Sales taxes are the second largest state and local revenue source. Some policymakers and experts view consumption taxes as the states' prerogative and express concern that a national VAT would impinge on states' ability to administer their own sales taxes. Th eir concerns are understandable, though states could retain their current retail sales taxes even in the presence of a federal VAT. But repealing their current sales taxes and replacing them with VATs that conform to a federal VAT base would off er many advantages for states. Currently, state sales taxes are poorly designed. McLure (2002, 841) refers to the \"nutty\" world of state sales taxes. Th e taxes exempt many goods and most services, which makes them unfair and ineffi cient. Forty-fi ve states and DC have a sales tax; 34 of them exempt food consumed at home, and almost all exempt some component of health-care consumption. Business-to-business transactions should also be exempt (to avoid tax cascading), but these transactions actually constitute around 40 percent of state sales tax revenues (Ring 1989; Phillips and Ibaid 2019; Gale 2005). State and local governments also have diffi culty taxing out-of-state, mail-order, or internet purchases made by residents. States that impose their own V A T s that conform to the federal VAT could solve these problems. Th ey could raise revenue with minimal economic distortion and vastly reduced administrative costs. 44 If the federal and state VAT bases were identical, the federal government could even collect revenue on behalf of the state, remit the funds to the state, and relieve the state of most VAT administrative costs altogether. At the least, states could piggyback on federal VAT administration as they curren tly do wi th the inco me tax, easing taxpa yer co m p liance costs and government administrative costs. 45 If states and localities adopt the federal VAT structure, they could replace existing sales tax revenues and protect the bottom 40 percent of households even more eff ectively than their current product exemptions do, with an average VAT rate of about 6.6 percent and a UBI equal to the state VAT rate times the federal poverty line. 46 Th e combined federal, state, and local average VAT rate, which would be 16.6 percent, would still be lower than the OECD average national rate of 19.3 percent. Th e experiences of the European Union member countries and Canada demonstrate that countries can successfully implement multilevel VATs (i.e., encompassing both the national and subnational tax authorities), Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 223 but the issue of interstate commerce merits further discussion. Without coordination among states, goods and services would have to be zero rated as an export every time they crossed a state border and then taxed as an import to the new state. Interstate commerce would be cumbersome and confusing. Keen (2001) highlights a simple solution to this problem: tax all business-to-business sales at the federal VAT and let states set their VAT on fi nal sales at whatever rate they would like. Th is solution would retain the character of the VAT as a sales tax, would eliminate the need to make state-by-state border adjustments for business-to-business transactions, and would allow states to retain control over their own tax rates on fi nal sales. 3. What are the political prospects for a VAT? Th e political obstacles to enacting a VAT in the United States are considerable. Policymakers mulled broad-based consumption taxes in the 1930s to plug the budget, in the 1940s to fund World War II, in the 1970s to share revenues with states and localities, and in the 1980s and 1990s as part of overall tax reform\u2014all to no avail. Th at makes the VAT, as one expert noted, \"the most studied tax system that has never been seriously considered by Congress\" (Schenk 2011). Politicians have notoriously long memories, and, consequently, former Democratic House Ways and Means Committee chairman Al Ullman looms large. He proposed a VAT in 1979 and lost his reelection bid a year later. Many factors contributed to his loss\u2014he was oft e n a w a y f r o m h i s district, where his only residence was a hotel room, and 1980 was a big year for Republican candidates. His experience, though, has served as a warning to politicians who may be considering a VAT. So, too, does the experience of Canada's Conservative Party, which was decimated in the election aft er it enacted a VAT. 47 In that regard, it is somewhat remarkable that leading policymakers of both parties have proposed VATs in recent years. Conservatives may decry the VAT as an instrument of European socialism, but they have proposed VATs themselves, just under alternative names. Th ey speak of the VAT like the wizards in the Harry Potter stories speak of Voldemort\u2014careful never to say the name. But the destination-based cash-fl ow tax that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee chair Kevin Brady proposed in the 2016 Republican \"Better Way\" blueprint is just a VAT with a wage deduction (Ryan and Brady 2016). VATs are embedded in Ryan's \"business consumption tax,\" libertarian Kentucky senator Rand Paul's \"Fair and Flat Tax,\" 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's \"9-9-9\" proposal, and Republican senator Ted Cruz's \"Business Flat Tax\" (Ryan William Gale 224 2008; Paul 2015; Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center 2011; Cruz Campaign 2015). VATs have also been proposed (and renamed) in Senate Finance Committee Democrat Ben Cardin's \"progressive consumption tax\" and the Bipartisan Policy Center's 2010 Domenici-Rivlin commission report, which called it a \"defi cit reduction sales tax\" (Cardin 2015; Debt Reduction Task Force 2010). Although these leading policymakers proposed to use the resulting revenues diff erently, they all viewed the VAT favorably for three reasons: it raises lots of money, it creates few negative economic incentives, and it is administratively sound. Th e Taxpayer Protection Pledge, also known as the \"no new taxes\" pledge, will be a signifi cant obstacle to enacting a VAT (or any other tax) that raises net revenue. Created by the lobbying group Americans for Tax Reform, which is headed by Grover Norquist, the pledge has been signed by 88 percent of Republicans in the 116th Congress (2019-21), including almost all of the party's leaders (Americans for Tax Reform 2019). No Democrats have signed on, and only one independent has. But in some situations, the country needs to raise taxes. World Wars I and II come immediately to mind. Even Ronald Reagan saw fi t to raise taxes on numerous occasions (Bartlett 2011). Th e pledge has been criticized by both the right and the left , is unpopular with voters, and makes negotiations about reaching a fi scal solution almost impossible: if one side will not consider tax increases, why should the other side consider spending cuts (Gale 2019)? 4. What can we learn from Canada's experience? Th e VAT operates in 168 countries and raises an average of almost 20 percent of all revenue in OECD member countries, suggesting that many countries fi nd the VAT to be a useful tool. But sometimes a simple example can speak as compellingly as reams of data. For example, we can assuage concerns about regressivity, government growth, transparency, and state-level impacts by focusing attention on Canada's VAT (Sullivan 2011). In 1991, Canada implemented a 7 percent national VAT to replace a tax on sales by manufacturers. It was introduced by the Conservative Party, which sought to address concerns about competitiveness and the government's fi scal situation. To address distributional concerns, Canada applied a zero rate to certain necessities (e.g., groceries, medicines, and rent), and added a refundable credit to the income tax for lower-income people. Transfer payments were already indexed for infl ation and highly progressive, which further off set the VAT's regressivity. As noted, Canada's VAT is completely transp ar e n t: i t is list ed sep ara t e l y o n r ece i p ts an d in v o i ces, j ust lik e sta t e and local sales taxes in the United States.Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 225 At least in Canada, fears about a VAT have proved unfounded: It did not decimate provincial consumption taxes; some provinces have converted their sales taxes to the VAT base, while others have not. Provinces set their own VAT rates, which either they or the Canadian government can administer. Of Canada's 13 provinces and territories, nine have a provincial sales tax\u2014four administered in addition to the Canadian Goods and Sales Tax (GST) and fi ve harmonized to the GST (Sullivan 2011). Th e rate has not risen inexorably; it has actually fallen over time. Policymakers cut the standard VAT rate to 6 percent in 2006 and then to 5 percent in 2008 (Sullivan 2011). It has not fueled government spending; Canada's general government tax revenue and spending have generally fallen as a share of its economy since 1991 (OECD 2017). Th e political concerns are partially valid; the Conservative Party took a beating in the election following the creation of a VAT. But the Liberal Party, which had promised to repeal the VAT, did not do so upon taking the reins of power, and the VAT has survived (Sullivan 2011). Conclusion Th e VAT has a lot to off er to policymakers and the American public. Th e tax can raise revenue in a relatively effi cient, relatively progressive, and administrable manner. Given the long-term fi scal shortfalls facing the country and the need for more government investment in crucial social priorities, it seems to be only a matter of time until policymakers will be forced to consider a VAT more seriously than in the past. Appendix. Alternative Forms of Consumption Taxation Consumption taxes come in many forms. At a high level of abstraction, the taxes are clearly related (and indeed equivalent in some respects). For example, in the credit-invoice VAT (sometimes called a goods and services tax), each business pays the government the VAT collected on its sales minus a credit for the VAT it pays on input purchases (as shown in table 1 earlier). Th e credit-invoice VAT can be thought of as similar to a retail sales tax, with revenue collected at each stage of production rather than in one fell swoop at the retail level. Th is comparison only holds, though, if William Gale 226 the VAT has two additional features. First, it must allow a full deduction for new investment in the year it was made (\"expensing\"). Second, it must provide border adjustments. Almost all real-world VATs possess these two features, which make a VAT a destination-based consumption tax, like the retail sales tax. Recall that a business's \"value added\" is the diff erence between its gross sales and its purchase of goods and services from other businesses. It is equal to cash fl ow plus total compensation to workers (for simplicity, wages), or (1) Value added = Sales Purchases = (Sales Purchases Wages) + Wages (2) = Cash fl ow + Wages Under the subtraction-method VAT (sometimes called a business transfer tax), an alternative way to tax value added, businesses pay VAT on the aggregate diff erence between their sales to businesses and consumers, and their purchases from businesses, as shown in equation 1. Under many conditions, the subtraction-method VAT gives the same outcomes as a credit-invoice V AT. Hall and Rabushka (1985) developed the \"fl at tax\" based on the subtraction- method VAT. A fl at tax divides the base into two parts. Businesses pay taxes on their cash fl ow. People pay taxes on their wages at a fl at rate with personal exemptions (see equation 2). Th e X-tax (Bradford 1986) is similar to a fl at tax but imposes graduated rates on wages and sets the business tax rate equal to the top tax rate on wages. Neither the fl at tax nor the X-tax contain border adjustments. As a result, they would tax goods produced in the United States rather than goods consumed in the U nited States ( see fi gure 1 and appendix table 1). Representatives Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady (2016) proposed a destination-based cash-fl ow tax that is just a VAT with a wage deduction (appendix table 1). It would tax the same business cash-fl ow base as the fl at tax and X-tax and would also implement border adjustments. Th e business taxes described above are not so diff erent from the existing corporate tax. If one starts with the fl at tax or X-tax business tax structure, the current corporate tax is largely recouped by allowing fi rms to take deductions for interest payments and by requiring fi rms to depreciate rather than expense their investments in structures (appendix table 1).

Endnotes 1. Th is paper is adapted from a chapter in Fiscal Th erapy: Curing America's Debt Addiction and Investing in the Future (Oxford University Press, 2019). 2. As discussed in the appendix, the equivalence between a V AT and a retail sales tax requires a few additional conditions, namely that the V AT expenses current investment and provides border tax adjustments. In practice, virtually all V ATs in existence satisfy these requirements. 3. See Batchelder and Kamin (2019), Gale (2019), and Saez and Zucman (2019a, 2019b) for further discussion of taxing the rich. 4. Th ese payments would not be considered in determining eligibility for federal, state, or local government means-tested programs. 5. All references to V AT data from OECD countries are from OECD (2016, 2017, 2018) and are weighted by GDP , unless otherwise noted. 6. OECD (2019) defi nes social security contributions as \"compulsory payments paid to general government that confer entitlement to receive a (contingent) future social benefi t. Th ey include William Gale 228 unemployment insurance benefi ts and supplements, accident, injury and sickness benefi ts, old- age, disability and survivors' pensions, family allowances, reimbursements for medical and hospital expenses or provision of hospital or medical services. Contributions may be levied on both employees and employers. Such payments are usually earmarked to fi nance social benefi ts and are oft en paid to those institutions of general government that prov ide such benefi ts. \" 7. Th e proposed tax rates are equivalent to a markup at the cash register, in the same way that retail sales taxes are typically quoted. In technical terms, the proposed V AT rate is a tax-exclusive rate (Gale 2005). 8. If the price level, including the V AT, did not rise , equity holders would bear the full burden of the wealth tax. Holders of nominal debt would not see any change in the value of their assets. 9. Keen (2001, 198) notes that both the liberal and conservative views \"are probably wrong. \" 10. Th e current policy outcome adjusts CBO's current law projections to show the eff ects of alternative policies. Major temporary provisions in the tax code are assumed to be permanent, and delayed provisions are assumed to be pe rmanently delayed (i.e., eliminated). Th e current policy adjustments also allow nondefense discretionary spen ding, already indexed to increase with infl ation, to grow with population as well. 11. Th is is meant to represent a tax-exclusive tax rate. Th at is, the V AT would be 10 percent of the price not including the tax. For example, if the good sold for $100 before the V AT is applied, a 10 percent tax-exclusive V AT would result in a levy of $10. Any tax can be represented with a tax-exclusive or a tax-inclusive rate. For example, if the good sold for $100 pre-V AT, a $10 tax would represent a tax-inclusive rate of 9.1 percent (10 divided by 110). 12. Th e prices given in this example assume that co nsumers bear the full incidence of the tax. 13. In 2016, 78 percent of children from the top income quartile enrolled in college, compared with 46 percent of children from the bottom income quartile (Cahalan et al. 2018). 14. One option is to tax fi nancial fi rms on a cash-fl ow basis. Th e International Monetary Fund has proposed a fi nancial activities tax that is essentially a tax on the sum of worker compensation and profi ts in the fi nancial sector, which is another way to calculate value added (see Keen, Krelove, and Norregaard 2016). Merrill (2011) advocates a tax calculation system that determines V AT liability on an account-by-account basis. Another option is the mobile-ratio approac h, which allocates the fi nancial margin of a fi rm to each fi nancial transaction and hence taxes almost all value added by the fi nancial sector (L\u00f3pez-Laborda and Pe\u00f1a 2018). 15. See Gendron (2011) for further discussion. 16. Border adjustment implies that the wealth tax imposed by the V AT is absorbed by Americans. Without border adjustment, foreign wealth holders bear some of the burden of that levy because U.S. exports would include the tax. But, such a process would also make U.S. exports more expensive and possibly harm exporting fi rms and workers. 17. Taxing everything at the same rate is not always the optimal choice in theory. Under certain assumptions, the Ramsey rule implies that inelasti cally demanded goods should be taxed at higher rates. Under diff erent circumstances, optimal commodity taxes should be higher for goods that are complements to leisure, which is untaxed. See Corlett and Hague (1953). 18. State sales taxes in the United States also provide product exemptions rather than per-household payments. 19. Th e table does not include the eff ects of higher federal government spending or revenues due to the tax the federal government owes to itself. Nor does the table include receipts from state and local government wages and purchases or the re bates those governments would receive from the federal government. All these eff ects, taken together, would not change the impact of the V AT on the defi cit. 20. Th ese fi gures assume that the monetary authorities accommodate the V AT and let prices rise by the full extent of the V AT (i.e., by 10 percent). If the co nsumer price level rises by less than the full extent of the V AT, some of the eff ect would involve lower government spending and a revenue decrease via lower revenues from other taxes. In contrast, when prices rise by the full extent of the V AT, there is no off setting response in the form of lower revenues from other taxes (see Toder, Nunns, and Rosenberg 2011). In a fi rst-order approximation abstracting from the impact of diff erent price level patterns on the economy, the eff ect on the federal budget defi cit and debt would be the same under any aggregate price level adjustment. Th e assumption that the nominal price level will rise diff ers Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 229 from the standard assumption in distribution al analyses (of income tax changes) undertaken by the Joint Committee on Taxation, CBO, and the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center that nominal prices stay fi xed. But it makes more sense in the context of a V AT, since the alternative is that nominal wages have to fall, a process that could trigger an economic downturn. 21. Th e return to capital can be decomposed into a \"normal\" return (that is, the return on waiting) and excess or \"supernormal\" returns, which can consist of the returns on risk, skill, monopoly power, etc. A consumption tax does not burden the normal return because waiting to consume does not aff ect the present value of consumption. Some households may also fi nance consumption out of public or private transfers, but those transfers ultimately stem from one of the three sources listed in the text. 22. Th is does not require that the wealth be eventually consumed. It just requires that some of the income from the wealth be consumed (i.e., that wealth ultimately grows more slowly than the interest rate). See Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) and Auerbach (2006). 23. An alternative viewpoint rejects the one-time implicit wealth tax and argues instead that \"deliberate attempts to impose such unexpected taxes are inappropriate\" and \"pernicious\" (Carroll and Viard 2012, 126-27) See Carroll and Viard (2012) and Kaplow (2008) for a more detailed exposition. One reason a tax on existing wealth is considered inappropriate is the concern that it could be repeated. In this regard, imposing a one-time wealth tax through a consumption tax (rather than, say, through an explicit wealth levy) off ers some reassurance, since the consumption tax can only be imposed once (though the tax rate could be raised). 24. Altig et al. (2001) show that, even in the long term, more than 60 percent of the growth eff ect of substituting a V AT for the income tax is due to the lump-sum tax on existing wealth. 25. Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center calculation. 26. If the general equilibrium eff ects of the wealth tax are considered, some of the eff ects of a direct wealth tax are likely to be borne by households below the top 0.1 percent. A lower capital stock would reduce wages, but a reduced amount of rent-seeking on the part of executives and fi rms could raise wages. For further discussion, see Penn Wharton Budget Model (2019). 27. Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center calculation using data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances aged to 2019 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 2016). 28. Understanding the avoidance, evasion, administrative, and revenue eff ects from Warren's wealth tax is a work in progress. No such tax or anything similar to it has ever been imposed in the United States. A study by the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that Warren's proposal would raise $2.7 trillion, nearly 30 percent less than the campaign's claims. Accounting for macroeconomic eff ects, the Warren wealth tax would bring in $2.3 trillion (Penn Wharton Budget Model 2019). Some commentators deemed the revenue estimates fr om a previous version of Warren's wealth tax to be overly optimistic (see Holtzblatt 2019 and Summers and Sarin 2019). See also Rubin (2019). 29. See Gale and Samwick (2016) for a more extensive di scussion of the relationship between taxes and long-term growth. 30. Downward nominal wage rigidity can lead to incr eased employment losses from a negative labor demand shock relative to the losses that would be expected if nominal wages were fully fl exible (Devereux and Altonji 2000; Elsby and Solon 2019). 31. Gale and Harris (2013) note that \"research has found only a weak relationship between the V AT and continually increasing prices. In a survey of thirty-fi ve countries that introduced the V AT, Tait (1991) fi nds that 63 percent exhibited no increase in the consumer price index (perhaps because they were replacing existing sales taxes) and that 20 percent had a one-time price rise. In the remaining 17 percent of cases, the introduction of the V AT coincided with ongoing acceleration in consumer prices, but in Tait's view, it is not likely that the V AT caused the acceleration. \" 32. Expanded cash income is a broad income measure equal to adjusted gross income plus (1) above- the-line adjustments, (2) employee contributions to tax-preferred retirement accounts, (3) tax-exempt interest, (4) nontaxable Social Security and pension income, (5) cash transfers, (6) the employer share of payroll taxes, (7) imputed corporate tax liability, (8) tax-exempt employee and employer contributions to health insurance and other fringe benefi ts, (9) employer contributions to tax-preferred retirement accounts, (10) income earned within retirement accounts, and (11) nutrition benefi ts (food stamps). For further background and explanation, see Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (2019). William Gale 230 33. Th e distributional consequences and characteriza tion of the V AT depend on how taxpayers are classifi ed (consumption or income) and how the tax is allocated\u2014either to sources of income (wages and capital) or uses of income (consumption). Th e results discussed in this chapter represent a middle ground between alternative ways to estimate the distributional eff ects. For example, if households were classifi ed by annual income, as they are here, but the tax were allocated on the basis of household consumption (rather than according to wages and supernormal returns on capital), the V AT (without UBI) appears to be very regressive in the long-run steady state. Because the V AT is a proportional tax on consumption, and because lower-income households consume greater shares of their income than do high-income households, the tax burden is a larger share of income for lower-income households than for high-income 1997). Alternatively, if households were classifi ed by annual consumption and the tax were allocated on the basis of household consumption, the tax is proportional across income groups in the long-run steady state. Likewise, to the extent that current consumption refl ects average lifetime income, the V AT is also proportional with respect to lifetime income (Casperson and Metcalf 1994; Metcalf 1994). 34. See Cnossen (2011) and Pomeranz (2015) for discussio n of these incentives under a V AT. In the income tax, businesses withhold income and payroll taxes on behalf of workers and send the money to the government. As a result, evasion rates for wage income are quite low (Gale and Holtzblatt 2002). Naritomi (2019) discusses ways to incentivize consumers to report retail sales to the government, which then can use the reports to check whether fi rms are paying taxes appropriately. 35. A national retail sales tax has other problem s (Gale 2005; President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform 2005). Advocates have argued that a 23 percent national sales tax rate would be suffi cient to replace virtually all federal taxes, but the calculation is fl awed, and the actual rate would need to be much higher to maintain real government spending and revenues. 36. V ATs do have some administrative problems of their own. While tax evasion is typically lower under a V AT than under an income tax, it is not always lo w; one study estimated a 40 percent evasion rate in the Italian V AT (Tanzi 1995). Informal sectors of the economy, such as tip income or babysitting, will escape a V AT as well as income or sales taxes. Taxing certain sectors, like fi nancial services, has proven diffi cult under a V AT because it is hard to identify the value added. New types of fraud, involving businesses that collect the V AT on th eir sales and then disappear with the proceeds, have emerged in recent years in Europe. 37. A famous case in Britain in the 1990s revolved around whether Jaff a Cakes were actually cakes or biscuits (cookies), which were taxed at diff erent rates. More recently in the United Kingdom, the taxation of nuts has become an issue. Nuts ar e zero rated unless they are roasted, salted, and removed from the shell, in which case they are subject to 20 percent V AT. Th e rule for peanuts is slightly diff erent: they are zero rated if they are removed from the shell but not roasted or salted. Further complications arise in nut mixtures. A recent court ruling regarding a dark chocolate bar, which could have been treated as a confectionary (taxed) or a baking ingredient (zero rated) hinged in part on the aisle in which the good was placed in supermarkets. Th ese types of rules are recipes for disaster in tax administration. In the United States, diff erences in sales taxes on pumpkins, depending on their use, and on candies, depending on their ingredients, have attracted attention in recent years. See Kaeding (2019). States' policies for taxing doughnuts highlight the complexity of sales taxes: North Carolina and Washington tax doughnuts sold with eating utensils, and New Y ork and Wyoming tax doughnuts on the basis of the quantity sold. See Erb (2019). 38. Missing trader intra-community fraud, a prevalent form of V AT fraud in the European Union, occurs when a business imports a good, sells it domestically, collects V AT on the sale, and simply never remits it to the government. Th e business disappears or closes, becoming a \"missing trader. \" In this type of fraud, criminal organizations take advantage of the lag between when V AT is collected (during a sale) and when the tax must be remitted to the government (in periodic tax returns). 39. A simple description of carousel fraud, based on Keen and Smith (2006), is as follows: (1) Firm A, in country 1, sells a widget to company B in country 2 for $100. Company A appropriately receives a full refund from country 1 of any input V AT it paid. (2) Firm B is not required to pay V AT to country 2 until its next periodic return. Let the V AT rate in country 2 be 10 percent. Firm B sells the widget for $110 (including V AT) to fi rm C, also in country 2, showing $10 as V AT. Firm B does not remit the tax to the authorities. Instead, it disappears before its next periodic return is due, and simply Raising Revenue with a Progressive Value-Added Tax 231 keeps the money (this is where the \"missing trader \" terminology comes from). (3) Meanwhile, the invoice issued to fi rm C entitles it to a $10 credit. Firm C sells the widget back to company A in country 1 (the return feature is where the \"carousel\" terminology comes from) for $100. Because exports are zero rated, fi rm C gets a full rebate of its $10 in V AT payments. (4) Th e cycle starts over. For each cycle, the loss to the government of country 2 is $10. Th ere is no value added in country 2, so there should be no net revenue. Th e government should have received $10 from fi rm B and then refunded that amount to fi rm C. Instead, the government pays the $10 to fi rm C but never collects the money from fi rm B. In practice, of course, the schemes can be much more complex, involving multiple layers of companies (not all in on the scam) located in diff erent countries. 40. Indeed, at one point, a single person appeared to account for 10 percent of worldwide sales of one type of computer chip. In fact, however, he had only a single box that was rapidly making round trips across the Ireland-UK border (Ainsworth 2006). 41. See the discussion in Keen and Smith (2006). 42. Among 16 Western European countries from 1965 to 2015, V AT revenue rose by 5.6 percent of GDP , but excise and other sales taxes off set almost all of that change, falling by 5.2 percent of GDP . Indeed, in many instances, policymakers in those countries enacted a V AT with the explicit goal of replacing less effi cient sales and other taxes. Total revenue in those 16 countries rose substantially over time\u2014by about 10 percent of GDP\u2014but the V AT increase in excess of other consumption tax reductions (0.4 percent of GDP) was only a tiny fraction of the total tax increase. Th ese fi gures update calculations in Sullivan (2012), using data from OECD (2017). All 16 countries are included in the analysis, regardless of whether they had a V AT in 1965. 43. Major cuts were passed in 1964, 1981, 2001, 2003, 2009, and 2017. 44. In light of South Dakota v. Wayfair , states have the authority to collect sales taxes on transactions in which the seller does not have a physical presence in that state, also known as \"nexus\" (Supreme Court of the United States 2018). If there were a national V AT, states that aligned their own V AT base with the national V AT base would be able to more easily collect tax on sales within their states by businesses that had no nexus. 45. Of course, a federal V AT would also have direct eff ects on states if it were to tax purchases by state governments. Nunns and Toder (2015) show, however, that if the federal V AT exempts state and local government spending, as proposed, the eff ects on state budgets would be either neutral or positive. 46. With a UBI equal to the poverty line times the V AT rate, the bottom quintile would receive a net increase in aft er-tax income, and the second quintile would face a net burden of zero (Urban- Brookings Tax Policy Center calculation). Under even the most progressive current state or local sales tax, those two groups would face positive eff ective tax rates. Th e 6.6 percent rate is calculated by setting the $414 billion in state and local sales tax revenue in 2018 (U.S. Census Bureau 2019) equal to gross revenues from the V AT (the $9,796 bil lion base times the tax ra te) less the cost of the UBI (the tax rate times $2,975 billion, the cost of the poverty level summed over all tax units). Note that a state V AT that substitutes for existing sa les taxes would not aff ect the price level or other tax burdens. 47. In 2010, the U.S. Senate went out of its way to disparage the V AT, voting 85-13 to support the statement \"Th e Value Added Tax is a massive tax increase that will cripple families on fi xed income and only further push back America's economic recovery. \" Such \"sense of the Senate\" resolutions, however, are not binding. For example, in 1981 a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate against taxing Social Security benefi ts passed 98-0. Under the provisions of the Social Security reforms passed two years later, Congress started taxing Social Security benefi ts (see Avi-Y onah 2011 and Carroll and Viard 2012).

Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 237 Abstract Th e corporate tax remains a nearly indispensable feature of the U.S. tax system, since 70 percent of U.S. equity income is untaxed at the individual level by the U.S. government. Yet taxing multinational companies presents policymakers with confl icting goals. Although lower tax rates and favorable regimes may attract multinational activity, such policies erode the corporate income tax as a revenue source. Unfortunately, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not resolve this policy dilemma. Despite big reductions in corporate tax revenue due to lower rates, the 2017 tax law does not adequately address profi t shift ing or off shoring incentives within the tax code, nor does it improve the competitiveness of United States-headquartered multinational companies. Th is chapter proposes a rebalancing of U.S. international tax policy priorities. Starting from current law, there are several simple changes that can raise corporate tax revenue and adequately address profi t shift ing and off shoring; these changes can be implemented almost immediately within the architecture of current law. In the medium run the United States should partner with other countries to pursue a formulary approach to the taxation of international corporate income. By dramatically curtailing the pressures of tax competition and profi t shift i n g , s u c h a n a p p r o a c h a l l o w s p o l i c y m a k e r s t o t r a n s c e n d t h e trade-off between a competitive tax system and adequate corporate tax revenues. Th ere is widespread international recognition of these problems; the current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Group of 20 process can serve as a steppingstone toward a fundamental rethinking of how we tax multinational companies in the 21st century.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century Kimberly A. Clausing, Reed CollegeKimberly Clausing 238 Introduction Th e U.S. system of taxing multinational companies is broken. It was broken before the 2017 tax legislation and it remains broken today. Th e U.S. corporate tax system raises less revenue than the revenue raised in peer nations, despite the fact that U.S. corporate profi ts are a historically high share of GDP. Th e international elements of our corporate tax system are mind numbing in their complexity. Th ere is a clear tilt of the economic playing fi eld toward earning income abroad rather than in the United States. Th e 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) built on a fl awed system and, in many respects, made that system worse. In some respects, the persistent dysfunction of our international tax system is unsurprising. Th roughout the world policymakers have been put in an impossible position, facing serious pressures from international tax competition while also attempting to protect the corporate tax base. At the same time, multinational companies are more powerful than they have ever been. Th ey command larger profi ts and larger market shares than in prior decades, control a large part of the economy, and undertake the vast majority of all international trade. Th is economic power makes these political actors diffi cult to resist, especially when companies raise concerns about competitiveness and threaten to take the tax base, investments, and jobs abroad. In many countries policymakers have responded to tax competition pressures by slowly and steadily lowering corporate tax rates and shift ing more of the tax burden onto labor and consumption. Th ese trends are troubling for a number of reasons. In a larger economic context of increasing economic inequality and a declining labor share of income, such tax policy trends risk both exacerbating income concentration and reducing possible public revenue sources. Th ere are also risks to the larger integrity of income tax systems. In the United States the tax cuts of the 2017 tax law did not resolve the essential tension between making the United States a competitive location for economic activity and protecting the corporate tax base. Th e law sacrifi ced large amounts of corporate tax revenue without achieving much (if anything) in terms of competitiveness. At the same time, the system became even more complicated. Beginning from current law, there are simple changes that would rebalance our international tax system. In this chapter I suggest several useful steps that fi t within the architecture of the current law. However, these proposals will be politically contentious, and companies will argue that Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 239 their competitiveness is being sacrifi ced in order to protect the corporate tax base. While such arguments are vastly overstated, a more-fundamental reform of the U.S. international tax system can put an end to the trade-off between competitiveness and tax base protection, allowing both to be achieved at the same time. Th is reform would tax multinationals on the basis of their global profi ts, which would be allocated to countries by the distribution of sales rather than by the ostensible distribution of profi ts. By moving toward a sales-based formulary system, the tax base will become insensitive to profi t-shift ing motivations, and policymakers can choose a corporate tax rate without worries about fi erce tax competition or profi t shift ing. Formulary apportionment of corporate income has many advantages relative to the current system. It curtails conventional profi t shift ing, it is administratively simpler, it is suited to the global nature of business activity and the modern nature of economic value, and it can become the basis of a stable international tax regime. However, there are also implementation issues, and this system would benefi t from eff orts toward international consensus building. While such consensus need not be complete, the current political environment, while challenging in many respects, provides a better starting point for international cooperation than many other periods. At present many countries have shown the requisite political will to tackle this problem. Th e years ahead may provide a rare opportunity to push for an internationally coherent system. While other reform suggestions have many merits, they also have important drawbacks. Th e Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/Group of 20 (G20) framework is too incremental; it is unlikely to fundamentally change the pattern of multinational company tax avoidance. Th e destination-based cash fl ow tax (DBCFT) is conceptually straightforward but comes with substantial practical problems, especially surrounding the necessity of a border adjustment tax. Residual profi t split methods have key advantages but retain aspects of the current problems associated with the arm's-length standard. Coordinated adoption of minimum taxes is promising, but it leaves open questions about the impact of non-adopting countries. Formulary apportionment will take work, but it stands the best chance for building an effi cient and stable international tax regime. Like democracy, and like capitalism, formulary apportionment could be the worst possible system, except for all the others.Kimberly Clausing 240 The Challenge: Competing Policy Aims of Multinational Company Taxation Policy decisions regarding the taxation of multinational companies frequently expose a tension between two competing goals: fi rst, enhancing the competitiveness of the location for multinational company activity; and second, protecting the corporate tax base as a revenue source. In most tax systems these goals are in tension. Countries making their tax system more favorable to multinational companies by lowering their tax rates, or by instituting favorable regimes for particular activities or companies, typically erodes their corporate tax revenues. 1 On the other hand, raising additional revenue through the corporate tax\u2014by raising rates, clamping do wn on in ternational profi t shift ing, or other measures\u2014risks reducing the attractiveness of the location for mobile multinational activity. While booked profi ts are far more tax sensitive than physical investment or employment, the latter activities also respond to tax incentives. Policymakers are particularly reluctant to be aggressive in their corporate tax collection eff orts for fear of discouraging jobs or investment. Corporate tax rates have declined steadily among OECD countries since the mid-1980s: In 1985 the average statutory tax rate among OECD countries was 43 percent; in 2000 it was 30 percent; and in 2019 it was 21.7 percent. Arguably, corporate taxation has been inhibited by a prisoner's dilemma situation. Absent coordination, countries have an incentive to lower their tax rates to try to gain tax base at other countries' expense. But if countries were to coordinate, they could sustain higher tax rates and a similar distribution of economic activity. (Th e aggregate amount of investment is far less tax sensitive than investment in any particular location.) WHY TAX CORPORATE INCOME AT ALL? O n e s e e m i n g l y s i m p l e s o l u t i o n t o t h i s d i l e m m a i s t o m e r e l y g i v e u p on corporate taxation, and to move capital taxation to the individual (shareholder) level. However, this approach encounters several serious problems. First, the lion's share (about 70 percent) of U.S. equity income goes untaxed at the individual level by the U.S. government, as shown in Burman, Clausing, and Austin (2017). It is unclear that there is political will to remove long-held tax preferences for endowments, pensions, retirement accounts, 529 accounts, and so forth, so this lack of individual-level equity-income taxation will remain a sizable consideration.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 241 Second, absent corporate taxation, the corporate form becomes a tax shelter , enabling tax -free growth in investments. Th e absence of mark-to- market taxation of capital gains, and the highly favorable step-up in basis at death, are important aspects of that problem. 2 At present, both capital gains and dividends are taxed preferentially relative to labor income. Th ird, there is reason to think that capital income is undertaxed at present, especially considering the rise of market power and the share of capital income that is not the normal return to capital, but instead some sort of r e n t o r e x c e s s p r o fi t. 3 Indeed, as of this writing in late 2019, the normal return to most equity-fi n an ced in v estm e n ts is ex e m p t fr o m taxa ti o n d u e t o f u l l e x p e n s i n g , a n d t h e n o r m a l r e t u r n t o d e b t - fi nanced investments receives a net tax subsidy. Corporate tax at present falls nearly entirely on returns above the normal return. 4 Th us, protecting the corporate tax base is integral to taxing capital (including excess returns), and taxing capital is an important part of the larger income tax system. Since it is far from trivial to simply move capital taxation to the shareholder level, that leaves policymakers with important corporate tax policy trade-off s. COMPETITIVENESS Competitiveness is an elusive concept. Even those focusing on the tax elements of competitiveness oft en have more than one worry in mind. Th e typical worry concerns the competitiveness of the United States as a location for economic activity. A relatively high domestic corporate tax rate could encourage companies to shift economic activities abroad. Of course, beyond the factor of tax many other factors are important for making the United States a competitive economic location. Th ese factors include the education of the U.S. workforce, the stability of U.S. institutions, research and development funding, infrastructure, and other important considerations. In addition, many U.S. multinational companies worry about the tax competitiveness of the United States as a headquarters location. In those companies' view, a competitive tax system is one that does not unduly hamper their ability to compete with companies based in other countries. From this perspective, the lighter the tax burden placed on the foreign income of U.S. multinational companies, the more likely they can compete with companies based abroad in foreign markets. Indeed, this concern provides a logical motivation for exempting foreign income from taxation through a so-called territorial system of taxation.Kimberly Clausing 242 Notice fi rst that there is a tension between these two ideas of competitiveness. Exempting foreign income from American taxation may help United States-based companies compete abroad, but it also means that domestic companies may not view the U.S. as a tax-competitive location for economic activity in comparison with the lowest-tax-rate countries, even if they remain headquartered in the U.S. Furthermore, the home tax rate being greater than the tax rate abroad provides an incentive to book profi ts abroad; the greater the diff erence between the domestic and the foreign tax rate, the larger that incentive. Th is leads to corresponding erosion in the corporate tax base due to profi t shift ing (see box 1). An important downside of a territorial tax system is that, without safeguards, it risks eroding the corporate tax base through international profi t shift ing. BOX 1. How Profi t Shifting Works Companies have many diff erent ways to shift profi ts off shore. Simple methods include mispricing international trade transactions that occur within the multinational company, such that purchases from low-tax affi liates are overpriced and purchases from high-tax affi are underpriced. Such techniques make the low-tax affi liates appear disproportionately profi table. Although companies are supposed to price such transactions as if they were occurring at arm's length with unaffi liated companies, there is oft en substantial leeway regarding transfer prices that can be used to minimize global tax burdens. Companies may also structure their fi nance such that interest deductions are more likely for those affi liates in high-tax countries, reducing taxable income accordingly. Companies may also use cost-sharing arrangements or other methods to transfer intellectual property to low-tax foreign jurisdictions, where the resulting profi ts can then be reported. Finally, companies have been adept at creating opaque chains of ownership and hybrid organizational structures to generate so-called stateless profi t that goes untaxed in any jurisdiction.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 243 Prior to the 2017 TCJA legislation, the United States had a purportedly worldwide system of taxation that taxed the foreign income of United States-based multinational companies at the U.S. rate, with two important caveats. First, U.S. tax was not due until the income had been repatriated from abroad, and if the income was held abroad indefi nitely, tax was deferred indefi nitely, providing a substantial incentive to book income in tax havens. While such income could not be used for U.S. investments or be returned to shareholders, it could ( and frequently was ) held in U .S. assets, thus making the funds available to U.S. capital markets. In addition, companies could borrow against these funds, achieving the equivalent of a tax-free repatriation. 5 Second, cross-crediting was allowed, such that tax payments to high-tax countries could off set U.S. tax due on income earned in low-tax countries. However, as the years went by and foreign countries cut their tax rates below the U.S. statutory rate, fewer and fewer companies had excess foreign tax credits, so funds were oft en held abroad in the hope of more-favorable future tax treatment when the funds were eventually repatriated. And, indeed, more-favorable treatment arrived: fi r s t in 2 004 a s a 5 . 2 5 p e r c e n t repatriation tax holiday within the American Jobs Creation Act, and later in 2017, when Congress enacted special low rates (8 or 15.5 percent) for deemed repatriation (i.e., mandatory repatriation of past earnings) as part of the 2017 tax legislation. Despite the high statutory tax rate and the purportedly worldwide tax system, there was no evidence that U.S. multinational companies were at a disadvantage prior to the TCJA. Th at is not to say that the prior system functioned well, or that it did not need reform. But U.S. multinational companies were thriving by every possible measure. In recent years corporate aft er-tax profi ts have soared as a share of GDP (see fi gure 1). At the same time, U.S. corporate tax revenues have remained fl at and are much lower than those of peer nations. 6 In part, low U.S. revenues refl ect the profi t-shift ing abilities of U.S. multinational companies; many multinational companies achieved single-digit eff ective tax rates as a result of aggressive profi t shift ing. Th is combination of historically high corporate aft er-tax profi ts and low corporate tax revenues gives pause to the idea that U.S. multinational companies are tax disadvantaged. Other assessments of the competitiveness of U.S. multinational companies tell a similar story. For example, it is clear that U.S. companies have an outsized presence in the world economy. Consider the list of the world's largest and most successful global companies compiled by Forbes in 2017, the Global 2000 (Jurney 2017). Th e U.S. economy is less than one-quarter Kimberly Clausing 244 FIGURE 1.

Regulatory changes in 2014 and 2016 substantially reduced the incentive for corporate inversions, and observers credited these regulations for stopping several possible corporate inversions. 8 From this starting point, the 2017 tax legislation cut corporate taxes by m o r e t h a n $ 6 5 0 b i l l i o n i n 1 0 y e a r s , p r e s u m a b l y f u r t h e r e n h a n c i n g t h e competitiveness of U.S. multinational companies by lowering their tax burden. However, as discussed in this chapter's appendix, the impact of the 2017 tax law on the competitiveness of U.S. multinational companies is, in fact, ambiguous. What is far less ambiguous are the large reductions in U.S. corporate tax revenue.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 245 EFFECTS ON OFFSHORING If companies can off shore profi ts without off shoring real investment, then the tax system might not distort the location of production activity. Companies can simply put jobs and investments in their most productive locations, and shift the resulting profi t to the most lightly taxed jurisdiction. However, if profi t shift in g i s limi t e d, o r if p r o fi t shift ing is facilitated by having a real economic presence in tax havens, tax rate diff erences across countries will encourage not only profi t shift ing, but also the movement of jobs and investments to locations that are taxed more lightly. Wh il e r e al e c o n o m i c a c t i vi t i e s a r e l e s s r e s p o n s i v e t o t ax r a t e d i ff erences across countries than the tax base itself (due to profi t shift ing), real economic activities still respond to tax rate diff erences, and the perceived mobility of real economic activity has been a big impetus toward competitive tax rate reductions over previous decades. Concerns about off shoring generate the same trade-off s that were discussed above. To keep your location as tax competitive as possible, lighter tax rates are desirable; however, lowering corporate tax rates (at current levels) lowers corporate tax revenues, unless rate reductions are off set with other changes in tax rules that broaden the tax base. CORPORATE TAX BASE EROSION FROM PROFIT SHIFTING Th ere is no question that the United States loses a great deal of corporate tax revenue due to the international profi t shift ing of multinational companies. Depending on the data source used, between 45 percent and two-thirds of all foreign income is booked in just a small group of tax havens, tax havens that together have a population less than that of California. 9 Figure 2 i l l u s t r a t e s t h i s w i t h B E A d a t a o n d i r e c t i n v e s t m e n t e a r n i n g s b y U . S . companies abroad. 10 In recent years a rising share of foreign profi ts have been booked in these top tax havens, an amount totaling $307 billion in 2018. Other excellent data sources come from the tax authorities. 11 Th e U.S. Internal Revenue Service Statistics on Income database indicates large s h a r e s o f f o r e i g n i n c o m e i n h a v e n c o u n t r i e s .

Recently, new country-by-country reporting tax data (form 8975) have been released for 2016. While these data are incomplete since fi ling was not mandatory in 2016, they also indicate large amounts of profi t in the big havens. 12Kimberly Clausing 246 FIGURE 2.

Note: The \"big seven\" havens are Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Switzerland.

(Th e revenue cost is lower at current tax rates.) Th ese estimates are broadly compatible with Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates of the cost of deferral by the JCT (2014) as well as work by Guvenen et al. (2018), OECD (2015), Zucman (2015), and others. 13 Th ese large revenue losses due to profi t shift ing fi t with a changing corporate landscape where market power is increasingly concentrated, corporate profi ts are rising steadily, and corporate profi ts are increasingly booked off shore. Th ese magnitudes are also compatible with the large stocks of accumulated earnings reported in the early country-by-country reporting data. As of 2017, U.S. companies show about $3.2 trillion of accumulated earnings in tax havens. 14 THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT In late 2017 Congress enacted Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the TCJA; the law took eff ect in 2018. Th e legislation combined large tax cuts for individuals, estates, many pass-through businesses, and corporations, and included sweeping changes in the international taxation Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 247 of multinational companies.15 Overall, the JCT projected the legislation would lose about $1.5 trillion in revenue over the 10-year budget window. Indeed tax revenues fell sharply relative to GDP in the fi rst year of the l e g i s l a t i o n , f a l l i n g f r o m 1 7 . 2 p e r c e n t o f G D P i n 2 0 1 7 t o 1 6 . 2 p e r c e n t o f GDP in 2018. 16 Federal corporate tax revenues fell particularly sharply.17 Since federal receipts typically increase as a share of GDP during strong economies, the reduced tax revenues are clearly attributable to changes in tax law. Th e m ain p r o vi s i o n s th a t aff ect the taxation of multinational companies are summarized in table 1, alongside their expected revenue cost (or gain) from the JCT estimates. First, the corporate tax rate is cut permanently, from 35 to 21 percent. Second, the foreign income of corporations is permanently exempt from taxation through the adoption of a territorial tax system, although territorial treatment is subject to the constraints of base protection measures. Under the prior worldwide system, foreign income was taxed at the domestic tax rate (35 percent) upon repatriation, with foreign tax credits for tax paid abroad. Th ird, there are two novel base protection measures, including a minimum tax (set initially at half the U.S. rate) known as the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Th is tax applies to United States-based multinational companies, and it is payable only on returns (relative to physical assets) that exceed 10 percent. Minimum tax is due if companies' foreign income is not suffi ciently taxed abroad, but the minimum tax is assessed on a global basis, so foreign tax credits from tax paid in higher-tax countries can off set the minimum tax arising from operations in low-tax countries. (Foreign tax payments are 80 percent creditable. ) Th ere is also a second minimum tax known as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) that aff ects all multinational companies; it is triggered by excessive deductible payments to related parties. Fourth, there is a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII). While this will benefi t existing companies with large amounts of export income, many doubt this provision will have a large impact on multinational company decision making. First, the provision is likely to be challenged by trading partners as an export subsidy, so the long-term stability of the provision is in doubt. In addition, since the provision only provides a subsidy for profi t s f r o m e x p o r t s , c o m p a n i e s t h a t a l s o h a v e s u b s t a n t i a l domestic sales receive more favorable tax treatment under the GILTI than under FDII. Th us, there is little reason to move mobile intangible income to the United States in response to this provision.Kimberly Clausing 248 TABLE 1.

Lighter rates may apply, or be anticipated, due to holidays, anticipated holidays, or expecta- tion of future favorable treatment upon transition to a new tax system. Permanently reinvested earnings are not taxed in the United States but might be expected to encounter deemed repa-triation tax upon transition to a territorial system. b. These rates are scheduled to increase after 2025, to 13.125 and 16.4 percent. Only 80 per- cent of foreign tax payments can be credited. This analysis ignores interaction effects between the provisions. Finally, under the TCJA there is a one-time tax on prior unrepatriated foreign earnings of U.S. corporations. Th ese earnings are taxed at a rate of either 8 or 15.5 percent, less foreign tax credits. Since those earnings have already been earned, this provision should not aff ect future multinational company behavior. Th e tax rates on the deemed repatriation represent a tax break relative to the tax treatment of repatriated earnings under prior law. THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW TAX LAW An appendix to this chapter considers the eff ects of the new tax law in greater detail. It is clear that the TCJA provided large corporate tax breaks. Th e net revenue loss due to the corporate provisions was forecast b y J C T t o e x c e e d $ 6 5 0 b i l l i o n . 18 However, the eff ects of the new law on competitiveness, off shoring, and profi t shift ing are less clear. In summary, Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 249 the new law does not appear to substantially improve on prior law in any of these areas for the following three reasons. First, while domestic companies undoubtedly benefi ted from the large statutory tax rate decrease, some of the most mobile multinational companies faced increased tax burdens on foreign income, due to the GILTI and the BEAT, potentially harming their competitiveness. Second, there are troubling new off shoring incentives in the law due to the structure of the GILTI and FDII provisions. Th ird, the law contains confl icting incentives regarding profi t shift ing, with some provisions increasing the incentive to shift profi ts off shore, and others reducing this incentive. Only time will tell us the full impact of the legislation, but early evidence (fi gure 2) shows an unchanged share of U.S. multinational income in tax havens as well as large corporate tax revenue losses for the U.S. government. The Proposal STRENGTHENING THE INTERNATIONAL TAX REGIME IMMEDIATELY Th e next section describes a fundamental reform of the system of taxing multinational companies that would make the policy dilemma between competitiveness and tax base protection almost moot. However, fundamental reforms take years of careful work on technical implementation issues, and although building international consensus is ideal, it is time consuming. In the meantime, policymakers should not sit idly by while corporate tax revenues fall precipitously, enormous profi ts are shift ed to havens, and new off shoring incentives take hold. Th e TCJA was fundamentally fl awed, but it can be improved within the basic architecture of current law. One question is whether to simply repeal the law in its entirety. Th at has some optical advantages: Congress is simply undoing a mistake. However, in international taxation current law provides a better starting point for reform than prior law in several key respects. First, the TCJA solved concerns about the prior worldwide system by ending the tax due upon repatriation. Today all foreign income is either untaxed or is taxed immediately. Previously, the tax upon repatriation generated immense taxpayer dissatisfaction as well as distortions in multinational company fi nancing. (As explained above, it had fewer real economic consequences, since companies could borrow against their off shore funds, creating the equivalent of a tax-free repatriation. Funds could also be invested in U.S. assets.)Kimberly Clausing 250 Indeed, moving to a territorial system was a crucial objective of the multinational community with the TCJA. Th e law addressed the criticism that the U.S. system, unlike that of most peer countries, was not territorial. Now, complaints focus instead on the burdens associated with the GILTI and the BEAT. Yet the GILTI and the BEAT provide a far better starting point for international cooperation than a toothless territorial tax system. As detailed in this chapter's appendix, the GILTI helps protect foreign tax bases as well as the U.S. tax base, since it lowers the marginal incentive for U.S. multinational companies to shift profi ts to havens, and it also reduces the sensitivity of U.S. multinational companies to non-haven foreign tax rates. Th e BEAT targets, in part, foreign multinational companies, and it is therefore less welcome in the international community. However, it discourages the profi t shift ing of all companies operating in the United States through a minimum tax that applies when there are excessive deductible payments to related parties abroad. Although it does not support foreign tax bases, the BEAT does signal a U.S. shift a w a y f r o m a n e a r l y unlimited tolerance of profi t shift ing. In this respect, the BEAT may also be a useful starting point for international reform eff orts. However, in one crucial respect the TCJA is a poor starting point for a reform of multinational company taxation. Th e massive revenue loss under the legislation, with more than $650 billion in net corporate tax cuts under the law (not including the tax cut on deemed repatriation), makes it diffi cult to bring the corporate community to the table in favor of future tax reform. In particular, the legislation has already given away the carrot of tax cuts. All that is left are the sticks of higher tax rates and/or more-serious base protection. Still, a revenue-raising corporate tax reform is the ideal path forward. I propose the following incremental reforms that all fi t within the framework of today's corporate income tax. Th e net revenue consequence is a gain of about $1.4 trillion over 10 years. Increase the corporate rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. Th is should raise about $700 billion over 10 years. A JCT revenue score would likely be higher for 2021-30 due to nominal growth in corporate profi ts. Strengthen the GILTI minimum tax by either moving to a per country version at 21 percent or keeping a global version but harmonizing the Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 251 rate to the U.S. rate of 28 percent. Th e fi rst option is estimated to raise about $510 billion over 2021-30.19 Reform the GILTI by removing the 10 percent exemption for returns on foreign assets. Th is would raise an unspecifi ed amount of revenue. Repeal FDII. Th is will raise $170 billion over 2021-30.20 Th e rationale for increasing the corporate tax rate is simple: We could not aff ord the large corporate tax revenue losses under the TCJA, and there are better uses of the forgone revenue (including tax cuts for others or spending on urgent fi scal needs). One argument for the lower corporate tax rate (of 21 percent) is that it is necessary to avoid profi t shift ing, corporate inversions, and the relocation of activity abroad for tax purposes. However, adequate minimum tax backstops are a better protection against profi t shift ing, since the vast majority of profi t shift ing is destined for countries with tax rates below our minimum tax rate. 21 Inversions can be prevented with simple legislative measures, discussed shortly. And, fi nally, there is little evidence that investment, employment, or wages are suffi ciently sensitive to corporate tax rates to justify such a massive cut.22 Th ere is more than one way to improve the GILTI minimum tax. One option is a per country minimum tax at three-fourths the new U.S. rate (21 percent, with a new U.S. rate of 28 percent); another option is a global minimum tax at the U.S. rate. Either reform should remove the tax exemption for the fi rst 10 percent return on foreign assets, since that provision directly encourages the off shoring of U.S. assets. A per country minimum tax would remove a perverse feature of the GILTI that leads some multinationals to prefer high-tax foreign country income to U.S. income. In addition, no companies would be unaff ected by the minimum tax, since there would be no ability to shelter haven income from the GILTI tax with tax credits from payments to higher-tax countries. Since all haven income would trigger immediate U.S. tax, there would be a more-serious deterrent to profi t shift ing. Th e rate is set at three-fourths of the domestic rate. A lower rate than the domestic rate is suggested as a compromise, in order to reduce concerns about competitiveness. One concern with a per country tax is that it would unduly increase administrative burdens due to the complexity of compliance and administration. Although such concerns are overstated, an alternative is to simply leave the tax as a global minimum but raise the rate to the U.S. rate. A harmonization of the foreign rate with the U.S. rate would remove the tax advantage associated with foreign income relative to domestic income. Kimberly Clausing 252 Th is approach would also raise substantial U.S. revenue, and would also help protect foreign non-haven tax bases.23 Th e FDII is unlikely to be eff ective in its stated aims, as discussed above, and also encourages the off shoring of physical assets, so it should be repealed. Together with the proposed changes in the GILTI, repeal of FDII will eliminate the incentive to off shore physical assets that was introduced by the TCJA. However, either type of reform to the minimum tax would increase the incentive for corporate inversions, since U.S. tax residence triggers the minimum tax. 24 Th us, a stronger minimum tax should be accompanied by stronger anti-inversion measures. Anti-inversion measures could include a management and control test, an exit tax, and/or a higher ownership threshold for determining foreign ownership. 25 In addition, the BEAT should be retained, and perhaps improved, to further reduce such incentives. 26 While it will be politically diffi cult to implement the reforms suggested here, it is important to raise revenue through the corporate tax. Th e TCJA, unlike prior corporate tax reform proposals from both Democrats and Republicans, was not revenue neutral, and instead lavished net corporate tax cuts on companies without any evidence that these tax cuts were wise policy. 27 Although the administration made rosy predictions that the corporate tax cuts would ultimately favor workers, raising workers' wages by thousands of dollars, both prior experience and the early evidence under the TCJA clearly indicate either very modest or nonexistent benefi ts for workers. 28 Indeed, the TCJA has many serious fl aws that are detailed elsewhere.29 Th e reforms suggested here would respond to several of these fl aws. First, they would raise revenue, allowing room in the legislation to undo the regressive eff ects of other provisions in the law. 30 Second, the reforms would seriously address profi t shift ing and corporate tax base erosion, making a far larger i m p a c t o n t h a t p r o b l e m . Th ird, the reforms would eliminate the bias in current tax law toward off shoring real economic activity. On net, these tax changes will also make the tax system more progressive, countering the bias in our tax system in favor of capital (and against labor) and asking more from those at the top of the income distribution. Th ese changes, while not revolutionary, will still require enormous political will. Clausing (2019a) discusses a more-systematic tax reform package that could help build political support for such changes, by pairing the net revenue Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 253 increases discussed here with net tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Americans. FORMULARY APPORTIONMENT Th is chapter opened with a discussion of the seemingly inevitable trade-off between a robust corporate tax and the concern that the U.S. tax system n o t d i s a d v a n t a g e e i t h e r U . S . p r o d u c t i o n o r U . S . h e a d q u a r t e r s . Th e tax policy proposals of the prior section accept this trade-off but place greater emphasis on corporate tax base protection than the competitiveness of the United States as a headquarters location, which can be mitigated with anti-inversion legislation. In some respects, the policies of the prior section actually increase the attractiveness of the United States as a production location relative to the TCJA by reducing the tilt of the playing fi eld toward foreign income and operations. Off shoring incentives under the TCJA are removed, and foreign locations are less tax advantaged due to the more-robust minimum tax. Still, companies will argue that the higher tax burdens envisaged in this proposal will lead to less U.S. economic activity and an erosion of the United States' competitive position. In this author's view, such arguments are exaggerated: Prior to the TCJA there was no evidence of a competitiveness problem, whereas corporate tax base erosion was an increasingly pressing concern. Th e TCJA furthered this imbalance, giving away $650 billion in net corporate tax cuts without substantially improving the competitive position of the U.S. economy. Yet, in the end, the merits of the changes suggested above illustrate a fundamental corporate tax policy trade-off between corporate tax base protection and the desires of multinational companies for a competitive tax environment. Observers will diff er in their opinion of how to weigh these two key objectives. In contrast, this section off ers a reform that can achieve both objectives at once: the adoption of sales-based formulary apportionment for the taxation of multinational company corporate income. Under the proposed system of formulary apportionment: A multinational company would be taxed based on its global income. Some fraction of that company's global income would be assigned to the United States based on a formula. I recommend a sales-only formula: Th e U.S. tax base would be the product of a company's worldwide Kimberly Clausing 254 income and the share of its worldwide sales that were destined for U.S. customers.31 Any company with at least $1 million of sales in the United States (indexed for infl ation) would pay tax to the U.S. government.32 Th e tax base would be defi ned based on the U.S. defi nition of taxable income. Th is retains compatibility with any possible U.S. tax base reform, including the reforms suggested by Furman (2020) in this volume. 33 Formulary apportionment would be applied to affi liated companies when there is common control of the companies.34 Anti-abuse rules would be included. More than a decade ago, in an earlier Hamilton Project paper, I suggested a similar reform with coauthor Reuven Avi-Yonah (Clausing and Avi-Yonah 2007). Th is discussion updates that earlier paper in light of several important changes in the international tax environment. First, corporate tax base erosion problems have dramatically increased in recent years, leading to serious international eff orts aimed at stemming the problem. In addition to the OECD/G20 eff orts, many countries have pursued their own unilateral policy responses; India has even considered a proposal for unilateral adoption of formulary apportionment. 35 At the same time, policymakers in the United States and elsewhere continue to succumb to tax competition pressures, lowering tax rates and providing loopholes in an attempt to attract mobile multinational activity. Second, comprehensive new proposals have been off ered, including the DBCFT and the residual profi t allocation by income proposal (RPA-I); these can be contrasted with the present proposal. Th ird, we have a greater understanding of the functioning of formulary apportionment in subnational contexts. And, fi nally, work has continued on the implementation issues surrounding formulary apportionment. Th is section will make an argument for a medium-term adoption of sales- based formulary apportionment, aft er suffi cient time has been allowed t o h a n d l e t e c h n i c a l i m p l e m e n t a t i o n i s s u e s a n d t o w o r k o n b u i l d i n g international consensus. Consensus need not be complete, but ideally some other major countries would choose to adopt the policy along with the United States. Once formulary apportionment has been implemented by some major countries, non-adopters will have a strong incentive to join. I next discuss how such a system would work, explain its key advantages, discuss possible drawbacks and how they might be addressed, compare the Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 255 p r o p o s al t o o th e r s th a t h a v e b e e n o ff ered, and suggest incremental steps forward. How Does Formulary Apportionment Work? Under the present system of separate accounting, companies account for income and expenses in each country in which they operate independently. Under formulary apportionment, a multinational company would instead be taxed based on its global income, and some fraction of its global income would be assigned to the United States based on a formula. 36 (See box 2 for a discussion of how formulary apportionment works in U.S. states.) With a sales-based formula, any company with a threshold amount of sales in the United States ($1 million, indexed for infl ation), would pay tax to the U.S. government based on a tax base that was the multiple of its worldwide BOX 2. Formulary Apportionment in the States U.S. states have long used formulary apportionment to tax the companies that have nexus in their states. In large part, this choice refl ects the near impossibility of asking companies to separately account for income and expenses in each state where they operate, given the substantial economic integration across U.S. states. A similar argument applies to the multinational operations of intensely global companies; it is not clear where profi t is truly earned for a multinational company, and these ambiguities generate ample room for tax avoidance. While some U.S. states use multifactor formulas (including assets, payroll, and sales), over time, more and more U.S. states have increased the sales weight in their formulas in response to concerns that states would lose employment or assets to states with lower tax burdens on those factors. As it turns out, these concerns were typically unfounded: States that increased sales weights did not gain employment or assets at other states' expense, as discussed in Clausing (2016). But, state governments\u2014oft en lobbied by local companies with large local production\u2014were nonetheless obliging, and state tax competition took the form of increasing formula weights on sales or adopting sales-only formulas.Kimberly Clausing 256 income and the share of its worldwide sales that were destined for U.S. customers. Th us, if a company earned $10 billion worldwide, and half of the company's sales were destined for U.S. consumers, then $5 billion would be taxable in the United States. Notice that this system transcends the trade-off s that were discussed above. Even if the United States taxed multinational companies at a high statutory rate ( say , the 35 percent rate in eff ect before 2018), companies would still pay tax in the United States as long as they had U.S. customers , regardless of their headquarter locations, their production locations, their fi nancial structures, or any other decision they might make. Th ere is simply no way to avoid the tax other than to arrange to have fewer customers in the United States, or more customers abroad, or lower global profi t. (Below I discuss how related gaming could be minimized.) One advantage of beginning with a sales-only formula\u2014as opposed to one that includes assets and/or payroll\u2014is that it resists the political temptation to adjust formula weights in an attempt to attract mobile jobs or investments. If adoption is not multilateral, that would be a particularly important consideration. However, there are also disadvantages to a single-sales formula. First, there are higher stakes associated with the sales factor, so anti-avoidance eff orts must be directed at artifi cial attempts to increase the sales based in low-tax countries; these are discussed further below. Second, there may be fairness or revenue-sharing issues associated with assigning the tax revenue to the market jurisdiction rather than to the production jurisdiction. T o s o m e e xt e n t , s u c h c o n c e rn s m i gh t b e l e s s im p o rt an t th an th e y s e e m . If a country consumes about as much as it produces from the corporate sector, then taxing the supply side or the demand side of the market should In 1986, 80 percent of the 46 jurisdictions (45 states and the District of Columbia) that taxed corporate income used an equal three-factor formula, 20 percent had higher weights on sales, and no states used a single-factor sales formula. Today, only 11 percent of jurisdictions use an equal three-factor formula, 35 percent have a higher (but not sole) weight on sales, and 54 percent have a single-factor sales formula. Th is steady increase of the sales weight demonstrates the strength of the tax competition dynamic with respect to formula factor choices.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 257 provide equal revenues. However, for countries that host highly profi table production locations, but sell throughout the world, they may fear that such a system would put them at a disadvantage. Th ere are also concerns that less-developed countries will be disadvantaged if their production in multinational companies is greater than their consumption of those companies' products. However, since poorer countries have greater losses due to profi t shift ing (as a share of GDP) than do rich countries, they stand to particularly benefi t from international tax reforms that stem profi t shift ing. 37 In addition, natural resource-intensive industries can be taxed through a separate system in order for local economies to tax location-specifi c rents from resources like oil and precious metals. Still, and especially in the presence of an international agreement, other formulas might usefully be considered, such as a formula that would equally weigh both the market of the jurisdiction (sales) and the production a cti vi ty o f th e j urisdi cti o n ( vi a p a yr o ll an d/ o r e m p l o y ee h ea d co un t ) . I t is more diffi cult to measure and value assets, so in this case I propose that the production side of the market be captured by employment, where we could use either headcount or payroll, or a one-quarter weight on each. What Are the Advantages of Formulary Apportionment? 1. As already described, the most important advantage of well-designed sales-based formulary apportionment is that it would vastly lessen both tax competition and profi t-shift ing pressures. Th ere is a long and v a s t l i t e r a t u r e i n p u b l i c fi nance that emphasizes that real decisions (e.g., decisions about which consumer markets to serve) are far less tax sensitive than fi nancial decisions (e.g., decisions about where to book profi ts), in Auerbach and Bakija (2008). Th at diff erence in tax sensitivity is at the heart of the argument for formulary apportionment. While formula factors like sales will be discouraged by formulary apportionment, it is far more diffi cult to rearrange these factors than paper profi ts. Furthermore, actual experience under formulary apportionment confi rms this lower elasticity of formula factors. In the case of the United States, careful analysis overviewed in Clausing (2016) shows that formula factors do not respond to tax burden diff erences across states. In other words, employment and assets do not shift toward lower-tax states. While U.S. state tax rates are lower than national tax rates, suggesting this comparison should be viewed with caution, one might also expect tax bases to be more mobile across state boundaries Kimberly Clausing 258 than across national borders, due to the absence of the many frictions that are associated with international borders. (Th ese frictions include language barriers, exchange rate diff erences, regulatory diff erences, c u l t u r a l f a c t o r s , l a r g e r a v e r a g e d i s t a n c e s , a n d m y r i a d o t h e r f a c t o r s . ) Drawing from the Canadian experience, Mintz and Smart (2004) also provide compelling evidence of the reduced tax sensitivity of taxable income under formulary apportionment. 2. In contrast to separate accounting, formulary apportionment is far more suited to both the global nature of multinational companies and the intangible nature of modern economic value. Separate accounting maintains an odd fi ction: Affi liated companies should transact with each other as they would with companies that were unrelated, the arm's-length standard. However, the very nature of multinational companies implies that there are higher profi ts associated with the common ownership of affi liated entities, so that they will together earn more than separate companies would if they were operating at arm's length. Th us, where does this additional profi t belong? Th is ambiguity is more than just a philosophical question: It provides ample opportunities for tax avoidance, as companies arrange matters so that the true source of such value is oft en an island with a zero-tax rate. S imil ar l y , th e so ur ce o f val u e i tse lf is o ft en ripe for disagreement. In a simple factory with capital and labor, value creation may be easy to spot. But for companies that are producing goods or services that are intensive in intellectual property, or where the customers themselves provide data that adds value, ambiguities in the source of value create ample tax avoidance opportunities. While a formulaic approach might reasonably be viewed as only rough justice, it will prove more accurate than letting accountants and lawyers arrange matters such that the lion's share of foreign profi ts ends up in tax havens. 3 . W h i l e t h e r e w i l l b e m a n y i m p l e m e n t a t i o n i s s u e s t o b e w o r k e d o u t with formulary apportionment, it has the potential to be far simpler than the present system. Th e arm's-length standard generates tremendous complexity, large compliance costs, and almost impossible administrative enforcement burdens. Th e OECD/G20 process that aimed to reduce corporate tax base erosion and profi t shift ing (BEPS) generated close to 2,000 pages of suggested guidelines. Yet most observers expect profi t shift ing to continue nearly unabated, and even the most sophisticated tax offi cials struggle with the enforcement and implementation of BEPS guidelines.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 259 Countries have turned to their own unilateral measures, but that hardly simplifi es matters. In the case of the United States, interactions between the GILTI, the BEAT, the FDII, and existing rules only add complexity to an already byzantine system. Abroad, there are myriad eff o rts th a t also co m p li ca t e m a tt e rs, in cl u din g th e U ni t ed Kin g d o m ' s diverted profi ts tax, Australia's anti-avoidance law, India's equalization levy, and the recent digital services taxes of Italy and France, as well as others that are still in the proposal stage. 4. Adoption of a sales-based formulary apportionment system, even without complete international consensus, holds out the prospect of becoming a stable regime for the international taxation of multinational companies, by changing the dynamic of international tax competition. While unilateral adoption by a large country can also generate this outcome, it would be ideal if several large countries were to forward together. Imagine, for example, a coalition of the European Union (EU), India, and the United States. Once these countries adopt formulary apportionment, there will be an enormous incentive for other countries to follow. Not only would it ease the compliance costs of their home companies, but also, absent adoption, non-adopting countries will lose tax base to adopters. Shift ing profi t to the EU, India, or the United States (in this example) would not increase tax liabilities in such jurisdictions (since liabilities are based on formulary apportionment of global income, and paper profi t shift ing does not aff ect formula factors), but it would reduce profi ts at home or in third countries. As far as non-adopting countries are concerned, it would be as if the adopting areas were a giant Bermuda; profi t shift ing to formulary countries will be an attractive strategy for companies in non-adopting countries. 38 Many governments share the goal of building a stable international regime that minimizes tax base erosion. Th ere is now an international recognition that tax base erosion is a serious problem: the OECD/G20 eff o r t s h a v e r e c o g n i z e d t h e i m p o r t a n c e o f t h i s p r o b l e m , a n d m a n y countries have summoned serious political will to address these issues unilaterally. What Are Downsides of Formulary Apportionment and How Could Th ey be Combatted? 1. Th e fi rst downside is the potential for double taxation or double nontaxation. Th is problem is mitigated as more countries adopt, and there would be a strong incentive to adopt. However, in the interim, there would likely be many instances of both double taxation and Kimberly Clausing 260 nontaxation. Of course, at present the problem of profi t shift ing to tax havens makes double nontaxation a clear danger of the arm's-length standard. Under-taxation of corporate income will persist as long as large amounts of profi t shift ing are tolerated. 2. Formulary apportionment may encourage the manipulation of formula factors. In the case of asset or employment weights in the formula, companies may respond by moving assets or employment toward locations that are more lightly taxed. In some respects, this may seem worse than paper profi t shift ing, since jurisdictions lose not just tax revenue, but also economic activity. On the other hand, as noted above, real economic activity is far less tax sensitive than fi nancial accounting, which indeed is a major advantage of formulary apportionment. 39 M o r e o v e r , a s a l e s f a c t o r i s e v e n m o r e d i ffi cult for companies to manipulate, given that customers are virtually immobile. However, companies could seek to game the sales-based factor in a number of ways. One option is to sell to a low-margin distributor in a low-tax country; in that case, the low-margin distributor would then sell into the higher-tax market. In this event, the fi rm would make its profi t on sales to a fi rm in a low-tax country, owing no U.S. tax, and the distributor would make sales in the United States, but would have very little profi t. However, even if companies were willing to cede control of the distribution of their products, there are possible legal solutions to this problem, including setting rules that look through the distributer to attribute the sales to the destination market. Specifi c rules of this nature are proposed in Avi-Yonah and Clausing (2019). 40 Others have argued that companies might merge in order to minimize their tax burdens. For example, the company Apple could buy a grocery store chain on an island haven. While such responses are theoretically possible, and while tax-motivated mergers are a real concern, this is another case where real corporate behavior is far less sensitive to tax incentives than are fi nancial decisions. 41 3. Finally, there are many important accounting and technical issues that would need to be addressed. In Avi-Yonah and Clausing (2019), we suggest some simple solutions to common problems, but it will take time to work out additional technical issues. Regarding the application of formulary apportionment, it could be based on a simple threshold of market presences (such as $1 million in sales), replacing the need for a permanent establishment threshold. Instead of defi ning the nature of unitary enterprises, formulary apportionment could be based solely on common control. Th e defi nition of the destination of sales could be Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 261 built around the experience with the value-added tax (VAT). And, more generally, the experience of other jurisdictions can provide substantial expertise, including the experience of subnational jurisdictions such as Canadian provinces and U.S. states. 4. As with the incremental proposals of the previous section, many multinational companies will pay much more in tax under formulary apportionment than they would under current law (as of 2019). Due to the large corporate tax cuts of the TCJA, very few companies will have lower tax liabilities under the new system, and therefore companies are likely to object to these changes. Since formulary apportionment eff ectively shuts down profi t shift ing and tax competition pressures, p o l i t i c a l o p p o s i t i o n i s l i k e l y t o b e p a r t i c u l a r l y v o c i f e r o u s f o r t h o s e companies that have shift ed large amounts of profi t toward havens and achieved very low eff ective tax rates on their foreign income. 42 5. Some observers have expressed concerns about interactions with tax treaties and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Th ese concerns have been discussed extensively elsewhere, but they do not present insurmountable obstacles. 43 How Does Th is Approach Compare to Other Reform Suggestions? In recent years there has been increased public scrutiny regarding the large and growing problem of international profi t shift ing, as sustained attention by journalists focused attention on this issue. Public and NGO pressure culminated in a multiyear eff ort by the OECD/G20 to address the problem, resulting in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS. Th is section will review these eff orts and will also discuss three additional academic proposals: the DBCFT, the RPA-I, and a proposal for a coordinated minimum tax suggested by Saez and Zucman (2019). 1. Th e OECD/G20 BEPS framework is an ambitious attempt to tackle corporate tax BEPS problems. It involves 15 action items that include t ax a ti o n o f th e di gi t al e c o n o m y , h y b ri d mi s m a t c h p r o b l e m s (b l am e d for the large problem of stateless income discussed by Kleinbard 2011), and country-by-country reporting. Th e BEPS process was an enormous eff ort and culminated in close to 2,000 pages of reports and guidelines as well as a multilateral convention to implement tax treaty-related measures to prevent BEPS and was signed by 89 countries between July 2017 and August 2019 (with the notable exception of the United States). Th is sort of cooperation aimed at combatting international tax avoidance is both welcome and laudable and will have a noticeable Kimberly Clausing 262 impact in several areas. Country-by-country reporting should improve tax transparency and help tax authorities assess possible enforcement issues surrounding profi t shift ing. While this action item is focused solely on large companies, those are the entities that undertake the vast majority of profi t-shift ing activity, and country-by-country reporting should help tax authorities gather helpful information. 44 Th e BEPS process has also helped countries combat hybrid mismatches that create income that is truly stateless and therefore taxed nowhere. Several areas have been diffi cult to tackle, and the OECD is presently wrestling with issues surrounding digital taxation and working on a variety of paths forward. In February 2019 the OECD suggested an approach that would simultaneously consider issues of profi t allocation (addressing which jurisdictions have taxing rights) and would ensure that multinational companies pay some minimum amount of tax (OECD 2019a). Th at work is still continuing, but in October 2019 the OECD proposed reforms that would substantially increase the use of formulary apportionment for digital or consumer-facing companies (OECD 2019b). Th e proposal establishes a sales threshold (to be determined) as suffi cient for taxing such fi rms, rather than requiring a physical presence. Th e proposal would distinguish between routine profi ts and residual profi ts; some fraction of residual profi ts would be assigned to market countries based on a sales-based formula. Profi t would be based on consolidated fi nancial accounts. Th e level of routine profi t might be a s s e s s e d o n a b u s i n e s s l i n e b a s i s ; t h i s i s y e t t o b e d e t e r m i n e d . Th e proposal includes dispute settlement provisions. OECD's approach is a hybrid in several respects, which adds substantial complexity. Some companies are included, whereas others (including those in extractive industries) are explicitly excluded. Routine income is taxed under the conventional arm's-length standard that treats affi liated companies as if they were separate entities, whereas residual profi ts (above some threshold) are taxed based on formulary apportionment. S o m e ( t o b e d e t e r m i n e d ) fr a c ti o n o f th e r e s i d u al i n c o m e i s a s s i g n e d to the market jurisdiction, and the remaining fraction is attributed to other factors (to be determined). Th ese fractions may even vary by industry. Th ese particular policy suggestions are somewhat revolutionary for the OECD, which has traditionally been unwelcoming to the idea of Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 263 formulary apportionment. More typically, the approach of the OECD/ G20 framework has been one of incremental improvement rather than fundamental change. Th e arm's-length standard, long sacrosanct at the OECD, remains at the center of most guidelines and recommendations, and it remains to be seen how consensus will evolve regarding these formulary methods. I n g e n e r a l , t h e O E C D / G 2 0 p r o c e s s p r o v i d e s h o p e o f f u r t h e r international consensus building, but the eff orts so far will not be enough to tackle the substantial problems surrounding tax competition. Although country-by-country reporting is underway, it has yet to pay large dividends. At present, the scope and magnitude of international profi t shift ing show no downward trends. Unfortunately, many incremental steps to shut down international tax loopholes can become akin to the arcade game whack-a-mole. When one arrangement is shut down (e.g., the infamous double Irish with a Dutch sandwich technique of layering affi liates to create stateless income), another arrangement pops up in its place, and the large share of income in tax havens continues unabated, as seen in fi gure 2. Th at said, progress should be judged relative to the counterfactual, and the problem of international profi t shift ing would be even worse without the OECD/G20 framework. Still, this process remains a far cry from an end to profi t shift ing. 2. Th e DBCFT is a business tax that would be levied based on company cash fl ow, with no deductions for interest or imported inputs, but with deductions for labor costs and immediate expensing of investments. Th is tax proposal has many attractive elements that make it a favorite of some economists. It removes the debt-equity distinction in corporate fi nance, reducing the distortions associated with excessive leverage in the corporate system. It is both a true tax on rents and diffi cult to avoid, so it could be levied at higher rates without worries of either distortion or profi t shift ing. As is oft en pointed out, the DBCFT is equivalent to a VAT plus a wage deduction. While that sounds a lot like a VAT, it is actually quite diff erent: Th e absence of tax on wages makes the tax a true tax on rents. Th erefore, the DBCFT is a far more progressive way to raise revenue than a VAT. Th e DBCFT was vaulted into the spotlight when it was considered as part of a Republican tax reform plan in early 2017. 45 During the debates surrounding the DBCFT, several weaknesses came to light. Some were idiosyncratic to the particular context of the Republican plan, which lost a lot of revenue in a highly regressive fashion. Such problems could Kimberly Clausing 264 be fi xed in future plans by choosing higher rates and packaging the DBCFT with diff erent associated reforms. H o w e v e r , o t h e r p r o b l e m s w e r e i n h e r e n t t o a D B C F T . Th e largest problem by far was the need for a border adjustment tax, since taxing the full value of goods and services requires not allowing a deduction for imports. 46 Th is raises similar implementation issues as with a V AT. However, while a VAT is consistent with WTO rules, the DBCFT is not (in the view of most legal experts), due to the wage deduction component. Th e wage deduction component is, however, a crucial part of the DBCFT, and one that appears to give domestic production an advantage relative to imported goods. Given the scale of the DBCFT, it would likely entail large objections by trading partners, and risk undermining the world trading system. Moreover, this proposal came forward at a time (the early Trump administration) when the world trading system already faced serious political challenges. S till , e c o n o m i c th e o ry p r e d i c t s th a t e x c h an g e r a t e a d j u s tm e n t w o ul d fully off set the apparent domestic advantage provided by a DBCFT. If exchange rate adjustments occur as predicted, that tax need not have real consequences on competitiveness, making the WTO issue one of legal concern but not one of economic substance. Still, a second problem arises if exchange rates do not fully adjust. In that event, since imports were taxed but exports were exempt, the DBCFT would harm U.S. importers and benefi t U.S. exporters, generating large sector- specifi c shocks. Many economists were content to argue why, in theory , the exchange rate should perfectly adjust, and they were exactly right. Th at said, in practice there are many possible impediments inhibiting smooth exchange rate adjustment, including the importance of the U.S. dollar in trade invoicing, a large number of countries that peg their exchange rate, and the more-general problem of the utter unpredictability of exchange rate movements. 47 Th e major countries that have adopted VATs under fl oating exchange rate systems have not seen their exchange rates adjust as predicted. Th us, while it is tempting to dismiss the concerns of importers like Walmart and Target as the worries of those who do not understand economic theory, there was actually reason to suspect they understood their interests well, and the DBCFT risked subjecting them to large economic shocks. Regardless, these industries mobilized against the border adjustment tax, eff ectively killing it. 48 Unlike the DBCFT, formulary apportionment does not require either a border tax or exchange rate adjustment. Under the DBCFT, all imports Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 265 are taxed at the border since there is no deduction allowed for imports. Th is is true regardless of whether the importing company earns any economic profi ts. Under sales-based formulary apportionment, only companies earning economic profi ts will pay a tax in the United States that is based on the destination of customers. Th erefore, there are far fewer worries regarding either incomplete exchange rate adjustment or the disruption caused by such a substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beyond these issues, it was clear that the groundwork had not been laid for the DBCFT to be quickly implemented. Th ere were important questions regarding how to handle fi rms with losses, the potential for tax driven mergers, diffi culties handling fi nancial fl ows, nontrivial eff ects on U.S. state revenues, and other serious transition issues. Finally, like sales-based formulary apportionment, DBCFT risks harming non-adopting countries. Since profi t shift ing to adopting countries would not aff ect tax liabilities in DBCFT countries (which are based on the locations of customers), but would reduce tax liabilities at home, other countries' profi t-shift ing problems could be expected to worsen. In the short run this would lead countries to oppose U.S. adoption (and strengthen those countries' resolve in WTO challenges). Still, if the United States went ahead, other countries would be left with a strong incentive to adopt DBCFT themselves. But, in the meantime, DBCFT would create problems of double-taxation and nontaxation, since tax base systems would be based on diff erent principles in diff erent countries. 49 Th us, similar to formulary apportionment, it would be ideal if DBCFT were adopted multilaterally. Moreover, there are two additional reasons for multilateral adoption. First, the more countries adopt simultaneously, the less exchange rates have to adjust, and the lower the risk that mis-aligned currencies lead to large sector-specifi c shocks or other diffi cult adjustments. Second, the more countries adopt, the more likely that WTO issues could be handled harmoniously, rather than risking new reasons for trade wars. 3. A recent proposal by a group of researchers, Devereux et al. (2019), suggests a compromise between formulary apportionment and the arm's-length standard, a residual profi t allocation by income method. Th is RPA-I proposal builds on a residual profi t allocation proposal from Avi-Yonah, Clausing, and Durst (2009). Under our proposal, a routine profi t would be assigned to each country based on an estimated market Kimberly Clausing 266 r e turn o n th e t ax - d e d u cti b l e e xp e n s e s in c urr e d b y th e m ul tin a ti o n al group in that country, and then any additional residual income would be divided among countries based on the group's relative sales in each country. Th e RPA-I proposal improves on our proposal in detail, addressing several important issues such as interest allocation and losses. However, it diff ers from Avi-Yonah, Clausing, and Durst (2009) in two key respects. First, instead of adopting a benchmark for routine profi ts, RPA-I separates routine from residual profi t by using the arm's-length standard, relying on comparable parties to calculate case-specifi c routine profi ts. Th is has the advantage of familiarity to practitioners, but it also has the disadvantage of retaining the vast complexity and administrative costs that are endemic to an arm's-length system. Second, the RPA-I proposal allocates residual profi ts based on profi t measurements that consider both sales and the allocable expenses a t t r i b u t e d t o t h o s e s a l e s , a s w e l l a s t h e r o u t i n e p r o fi t. In contrast, our residual profi t method simply relied on the destination of sales. While those two outcomes may oft en be similar, the RPA-I outcome is better suited to situations where profi t/cost ratios vary substantially across countries. However, the choice to allocate residual profi ts in this manner raises complexity a great deal, and also provides avoidance opportunities. Overall, the RPA-I proposal is a compromise. It uses both arm's-length and formulary methods to determine the tax base, and it allocates parts of the tax base to both the supply and demand sides of the market. Th e downside of the proposal is that it retains both the complexity of the arm's-length standard, and the tax avoidance opportunities lying therein, albeit in somewhat muted form. 4. In a recent book Saez and Zucman (2019) suggest that countries collaborate in adopting a minimum tax on corporate income. Similar e l e m e n t s h a v e b e e n i n c l u d e d i n p r o p o s a l s b y A v i - Y o n a h ( 2 0 1 5 ) a n d others, but the Saez and Zucman approach suggests combining a coordinated minimum tax with a formulary approach to address non-adopting countries. Th is proposal is compatible with the immediate reforms suggested earlier in this chapter. In addition to the United States adopting a per country minimum tax, other countries would also adopt per country minimum taxes; Saez and Zucman (2019) suggest a minimum tax rate of 25 percent. Coordination would be encouraged through international Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 267 tax agreements like the OECD/G20 process.50 Coordination would also be incentivized through the use of other international policy levers such as trade agreements and economic sanctions against tax havens. Under such a system, companies headquartered in non-adopting countries may have a tax advantage relative to those in adopting countries. And inversions (or new incorporations in low-tax countries) may be tax-encouraged, although Saez and Zucman (2019) note that corporate inversions are small in recent years, and inversions can be eff ectively limited by regulations. Still, to support the coordinated minimum tax, Saez and Zucman (2019) suggest a formulary system for taxing the tax defi cit of multinational c o m p a n i e s t h a t a r e r e s i d e n t i n n o n - a d o p t i n g c o u n t r i e s . C o u n t ry - b y -country reporting data could be used to calculate tax defi cits\u2014the tax that would have been paid in the event that the resident country had enacted a 25 percent minimum tax. A portion of that tax defi cit would then be collected by adopting countries using sales-based formulary apportionment. Th ese reforms would substantially limit international tax competition and profi t-shift ing pressures. Still, this approach retains the complexity of current tax rules for taxing multinational companies while adding the additional complexity of adopting a formulary system for non-m i n i m u m - t a x c o u n t r i e s . I t a l s o p u t s p r e s s u r e o n t h e d e fi nition of residence for tax purposes, although there are useful legal and regulatory solutions to that problem. 51 Questions and Concerns 1. What sorts of tax avoidance strategies would be available under sales-only formulary apportionment and how could those strategies be deterred? One important concern is that a multinational could sell to a low-margin distributor in a low-tax country and thereby lower the rate it faces. Th e low- margin distributor would then sell into the higher-tax market. It would face a higher tax rate, but on a much smaller total profi t. Avi-Yonah and Clausing (2019) describe one response to this strategy. Th e rule we suggest is, \"Goods, services or intangibles which are sold or licensed to an unrelated person will be presumed for purposes of this section to h a v e b e e n s o l d o r l i c e n s e d f o r u s e , c o n s u m p t i o n , o r d i s p o s i t i o n in the country of destination of the property sold or services Kimberly Clausing 268 or intangibles provided; for such purpose, the occurrence in a country of a temporary interruption in shipment of goods shall not constitute such country the country of destination. However, if at the time of a sale of personal property or services or license of intangibles to an unrelated person the enterprise knew, or should have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the property, services or intangibles probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of destination, the enterprise must determine the country of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition of the property, services or intangibles or the property, services or intangibles will be presumed to have been used, consumed, or disposed of in the United States\" (849). We have already discussed in the previous section other downsides of formulary apportionment, and possible responses. 2. Are there incremental steps toward formulary apportionment that policymakers could take? In moving toward a formulary apportionment system, there are incremental a p p r o a c h e s t h a t w e c o u l d t a k e t o i n c r e a s e r e l i a n c e o n e a s i l y c a l c u l a t e d benchmarks instead of the judgments of tax-minimizing accountants. For example, profi t-split methods have been long accepted by the OECD. While these apply formulary approaches at a transaction level, there are useful ways to extend similar methods to a broader arena, some of which have been explored in the context of the BEPS framework. Building on these methods further may naturally lead us to favor a residual profi t-split proposal, such as those suggested by Avi-Yonah, Clausing, and Durst (2009) or Devereux et al. (2019). As discussed above, the latter proposal uses both formulary and arm's-length methods, whereas the former proposal assigns a fi xed return on expenses, and then assigns the residual income based on formula. Both proposals lie on a continuum between the arm's-length standard and a formulary system, although the 2009 proposal is closer than the 2019 proposal to the formulary end of the continuum. Another possibility is to use a formulary system as part of a minimum tax regime, as suggested in a report from the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT; 2018). Countries could apply a formula to multinational companies' global income and compute the minimum tax payable at some fraction of the regular corporate tax rate. A formulary minimum tax would retain the complexity Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 269 of the present system, while layering additional complexity on top, but it might be a suitable rough justice solution for those tax authorities that lack the administrative capability to collect corporate tax from multinational companies under the arm's-length standard. 3. Do sales-based formulas disadvantage the United States, since the United States is home to many profi table multinational companies? If a country consumes about as much as it produces from the corporate sector, then taxing the supply side or the demand side of the market should provide equal revenues. However, since the United States hosts the headquarters of many highly profi table multinational companies that sell their goods and services throughout the world, there may be fears that such a system would disadvantage the United States. Still, under the arm's-length system of taxation, U.S. corporate tax revenues have been far lower (as a share of GDP) than those of typical peer nations, due in part to the aggressive profi t shift ing of U.S. multinational companies. Recent estimates in Clausing (2019b) suggest that the U.S. government loses more than $100 billion each year due to the profi t shift ing of multinational companies. Th us, the U.S. government has a lot to gain from proposals that stem profi t shift ing. A l s o , i t i s h e l p f u l t o r e m e m b e r t h a t U . S . c o n s u m e r s b u y m a n y i m p o r t s . Profi table foreign-headquartered companies will also pay U.S. corporate tax based on sales that are destined for U.S. consumers, assuming they reach a modest $1 million sales threshold. Conclusion Th ere is more than one path forward in reforming U.S. international taxation. In the short run, incremental steps are likely to be more practical than systemic reforms. I suggest a reform that raises the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, strengthens the minimum tax, and repeals the FDII deduction. Together, these changes provide substantial gains relative to current law: raising corporate tax revenues in a progressive fashion, curtailing the off shoring incentives caused by the TCJA, and countering profi t shift ing to tax havens. In the medium run, a sales-based formulary apportionment system can better counter the pressures of international tax competition and profi t shift ing. Under such a system, there is no longer a trade-off between competitiveness and corporate tax base protection. Any company serving the U.S. market will pay income tax in the United States based on its global Kimberly Clausing 270 income and the fraction of its sales that are destined for U.S. customers. Pr o pe r l y im p l e m e n t ed, s u ch a syst e m is a m a j o r im p r o v e m e n t r e la ti v e t o the arm's-length standard. A formulary system better suits the intangible nature of much modern economic value and the global integration of much modern business activity. As discussed above, there is still important work that needs to be done on the details of implementing formulary apportionment, including both attention to technical and legal issues as well as, ideally, international consensus building with other countries. While such a major reform will benefi t from allowing time for careful implementation and consensus building, policymakers can build on prior experience with formulary systems as well as the momentum created by the OECD/G20 BEPS process. In many countries, there is serious recognition of these policy problems a s w e ll a s s u b s t an t i al p o l i t i c al will a i m e d a t s o l u t i o n s . M o vi n g t o w a r d a system of formulary apportionment can provide the basis for a stable and sustainable international tax regime. Regardless of the path chosen, protecting the corporate tax is especially important today. Th e corporate tax remains the only tool for taxing about 70 percent of U.S. equity income, which goes untaxed by the U.S. government at the individual level. And the individual taxation of capital income, when it exists, also creates important policy challenges. 52 Aft er four decades of increasing income inequality, disappointing wage gains, a shrinking labor share of income, and increasing market power, it is more important than ever to have a tax system that eff ectively taxes capital. 53 Importantly , much capital income is not the normal return to capital, but rather some excess return, or rent. In this context, strengthening corporate taxation is especially important. Formulary apportionment remains a very promising medium-term proposal, but there are also many useful steps that can be taken immediately to improve corporate taxation. All that is needed is political will. Appendix: The Effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW TAX LAW ON COMPETITIVENESS AND OFFSHORING It is clear that the TCJA provided large corporate tax breaks, estimated by JCT at about $650 billion over 10 years. Th e more than $1.3 trillion in revenue cost from the statutory rate cut was off set in part by base expansion, due to Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 271 the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction, less-favorable treatment of net operating losses, amortization of research expenditures beginning in 2023, and the somewhat-less-favorable treatment of debt-fi nanced investments. Th e international provisions are more neutral in their revenue eff ects. While the deemed repatriation tax revenue comes in over the 10-year revenue window, it is a one-time provision, and it represents a tax cut relative to prior law. Although companies were sometimes disappointed that this repatriation tax cut was not even more generous, there is certainly no effi ciency rationale for lighter tax treatment, since it is obviously diffi cult to encourage earnings that have already been earned. Th is provision is unlikely to have important incentive eff ects going forward. As for the other international provisions, some raise revenue (the GILTI and the BEAT), whereas others lose revenue (territoriality and the FDII). On net, the international provision of the tax law (excluding repatriation) have a slight negative revenue consequence over 10 years (a loss of $14 billion). 54 And, more-recent estimates by Horst (2019) suggest a greater negative loss from these provisions than originally estimated by the TCJA. 55 Focusing on revenue alone, it seems clear that companies should be more competitive post-TCJA than pre-TCJA; the corporate community as a whole received very large tax cuts, netting more than $650 billion, lowering the tax burdens associated with U.S. corporate income. 56 Still, the impact on competitiveness for multinational companies depends on individual company circumstances. For example, consider a highly profi table multinational company that booked most of its income in tax havens prior to the TCJA. While the company could not access these funds without fear of a repatriation tax, it could borrow against them (and frequently did), creating the equivalent of a tax-free repatriation, as explained above. Th us, the tax treatment of foreign income was arguably already quite competitive. Under the new law, due the GILTI and the BEAT, such a company may fi nd that its overall tax burden on foreign income has increased substantially, actually lowering its (tax) competitiveness relative to prior law. Arguably, the new territorial tax system is more worldwide than the old one, since the older system raised very little revenue taxing foreign income (because U.S. tax due was either indefi nitely deferred, off set with tax credits, or given holiday rates), whereas the new system subjects many multinational companies to immediate taxation on lightly taxed foreign income through the GILTI; also, some companies incur BEAT tax liability. Kimberly Clausing 272 Because of these provisions, many observers argue that the new system could be less tax-competitive than the old one. Of course, for purely domestic companies, corporate tax burdens have undoubtedly gone down, but since competitiveness concerns were typically focused on global companies facing foreign competitors, domestic companies were not generally the target. Beyond tax competitiveness, there are also some troubling new incentives in the TCJA that will increase the off shoring of investment and jobs. Under the GILTI, the fi r s t 1 0 p e r c e n t r e t u r n o n f o r e i g n a s s e t s i s e x e m p t f r o m the minimum tax. Th is gives companies an incentive to increase physical investments of plant and equipment in low-tax countries in order to reduce the bite of the GILTI tax. In addition, the FDII also encourages the off shoring of real investment. Th e FDII tax preference for export income applies only for income above a baseline return on assets. Th us, the more U.S. assets, the lower the tax benefi t from FDII. For example, imagine moving an asset from the United States to a tax haven; that will lower your assets in the United States, increasing the return on the remaining assets and therefore the FDII deduction. In addition, now that the asset is abroad, it will result in more tax-free GILTI income, since the fi rst 10 percent return on foreign assets is tax free. Together, these two provisions reward the off shoring of U.S. assets. In general, if a company is indiff erent between locating investments in the United States or in a low-tax country abroad, a comparison of the tax treatment under GILTI and FDII will bias the decision in favor of foreign investment. Although the FDII is meant to encourage U.S. activity, it may be perceived as a less reliable tax benefi t due to uncertainties regarding its WTO compatibility that may subject it to legal challenges. Even beyond that concern, however, it is typically better for a company to serve the U.S. market from a tax haven, since both foreign and U.S. income receive a tax preference, whereas FDII rewards only U.S. export income. In addition, although increased physical assets increase the amount of tax-free income under GILTI, they reduce the tax benefi ts of FDII. Indeed, early evidence from Beyer et al. (2019) shows that the multinational companies with the largest benefi ts from reducing the pre-TCJA repatriation costs actually have increased foreign, rather than domestic, investment in the wake of the TCJA. Th is fi nding is compatible with the new incentives for off shoring under the law.Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 273 THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW TAX LAW ON PROFIT SHIFTING Th e eff ects of the new tax law on profi t shift ing are, in theory, ambiguous. Th e territorial tax treatment of some income, and the absence of tax upon repatriation, should increase the incentive to shift profi t abroad, since there will n o l o ng er be co n cerns abo u t r epa tria ti o n tax wh en r eturning p r o fi ts to shareholders. Th e absence of U.S. tax for the fi rst 10 percent return on foreign assets, and the lower tax rate that applies to GILTI income rather than U.S. income, both incentivize earning profi ts off shore instead of in the United States. Still, both minimum taxes are targeted at reducing profi t shift ing. Th e BEAT does this directly, by taxing companies with excessive deductible payments to related parties. Th e GILTI has eff ects that depend on company c i r c u m s t a n c e s . C o m p a n i e s w i t h i n c o m e e a r n e d i n b o t h h i g h - t a x ( o r medium-tax) and low-tax countries might not be subject to GILTI tax, since the tax credits from the higher-tax country will off set any GILTI liability on the low-tax income. In this case, the eff ects of the tax law are to encourage more shift ing to tax havens: Th e excess tax credits shield haven income from the minimum tax, and there is no longer any concern of tax due upon repatriation due to the territorial treatment of foreign income. In addition, for any company not earning returns of more than a 10 percent return on assets, the new regime would also encourage profi t shift ing, since the GILTI would not apply, nor would repatriation tax. However, for companies that are not shielded from the GILTI tax by excess tax credits from their operations in higher-tax countries, profi t shift ing is discouraged. Relative to the prior tax treatment of haven income, the GILTI raises the tax burden on low-taxed foreign income, while blunting the negative eff ects of earning income in high tax countries. Th is reduces the incentive to earn income in low-tax countries, and it also reduces the deterrent of higher tax rates in foreign countries. 57 Oddly for such companies, the United States is the least desirable place to book income. Haven income is the best, since it is taxed at half the U.S. rate. 58 But higher-tax country income is still preferred to U.S. income, since the tax payments abroad shield some haven income from GILTI tax, whereas U.S. income comes with no such benefi ts. 59 Still, on net, for companies paying the GILTI, there should be a reduced incentive to shift income to havens, and that should help buttress the U.S. corporate tax base. Under the old regime, a dollar earned in Bermuda (which applies no corporate tax) instead of the United States saved 35 cents Kimberly Clausing 274 in tax payments. Upon repatriation, that dollar would face some tax (e.g., 8 or 15.5 percent under the deemed repatriation regime), but until then, the income could grow tax free, and a tax deferred is a tax saved. Now, for companies subject to the GILTI, a dollar earned in Bermuda instead of the United States saves only 10.5 cents in tax payments, which lowers the marginal incentive to shift income to Bermuda and other tax havens. In addition, the BEAT, by taxing companies with excessive deductible payments to related parties off s h o r e , i s a l s o l i k e l y t o w e a k e n profi t-shift ing incentives. Given the ambiguities in the law, it is ultimately an empirical question whether the TCJA will reduce profi t shift ing relative to prior law. Considering the JCT revenue estimates of table 1, it appears that the negative eff ect of territoriality on corporate tax revenues, as well as the FDII, narrowly exceed the positive eff ects of the BEAT and the GILTI, implying that the international provisions as a whole do not raise revenue. Still, these assessments depend on many uncertainties. Estimates based on early fi nancial data from Horst (2019) imply larger revenue losses. In Clausing (2019c), I consider the eff ects of the statutory rate change, together with the GILTI, on profi t-shift ing incentives. Based on analyses of U.S. multinational companies' tax responsiveness, I estimate that profi t shift ing will decrease in the long run, causing an approximately 20 percent reduction in the U.S. affi liate tax base in haven countries, which results in a modest increase in the U.S. tax base. Of note, a per country minimum tax would have a much larger eff ect on profi t-shift ing behavior than the global minimum tax, since all companies would be disincentivized from booking income in havens, as tax credits from operations in high-tax countries would no longer cushion against the tax liability associated with haven income. Indeed, the positive U.S. revenue eff ects from the per country tax are estimated to be more than 2.5 times those of the global minimum tax. A per country tax would also remove the tax preference for foreign income relative to U.S. income due to the global-averaging feature of the GILTI. 60 Early evidence from the fi rst year of the tax law indicates little eff ect of the TCJA on the location of U.S. multinational companies' profi ts. As fi gure 2 shows, the share of foreign income booked in the seven most important tax havens is almost constant between 2017 (the last year under the old law) and 2018 (the fi rst year under the new law).Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 275 To some extent, the constant nature of profi t shift ing is unsurprising, particularly in the short run. Th e companies that undertake the vast majority of profi t shift ing are large multinational companies with vast accounting and legal expertise. Once such companies have invested in the expertise required to minimize their global tax burden, it hardly makes sense for them to stop doing that just because the marginal rewards from profi t shift ing have diminished. Th e rewards are still substantial. S t i l l , o v e r t i m e w e e x p e c t e c o n o m i c a c t o r s t o r e s p o n d t o m a r g i n a l incentives, and the marginal incentive for profi t shift ing has been reduced f or some com panies, so that sho uld ultimately lead to some red uctio n in profi t shift ing. Of course, the details of implementing regulations and tax planning, as well as the tax laws of other countries, can make a big diff erence. In the end, only time will tell. COMPLEXITY AND ADMINISTRATION Th e international tax provisions under the TCJA are mind-numbingly b y z a n t i n e . I n m a n y r e s p e c t s t h e c o m p l e x i t y i s n o t h i n g n e w ; t h e U . S . international tax system has always been enormously complicated. However, the new provisions (GILTI, FIDII, and BEAT) confound even legal and accounting experts. Furthermore, the provisions together are more complicated than any provision alone, since there are interaction eff ects between the provisions, as well as the additional complications of foreign tax credits, expense allocations, interest deduction limitations, and so forth. I n p a r t t h i s c o m p l e x i t y o r i g i n a t e s w i t h t h e i n e v i t a b l e c o n fl icts between two of the competing tax policy goals discussed above: encouraging the competitiveness of U.S.-based multinational companies while also protecting the corporate tax base from profi t shift ing. Indeed, complexity is unavoidable if one is striving to couple a territorial tax system with corporate tax base protection. Th us, while the additional complexity is troubling, the TCJA should be commended for providing some limits on tax avoidance through the GILTI and the BEAT. Given the present imbalances in the U.S. international tax system, the legislation is better with these base protection measures than without t hem.

Some countries might be able to combine low tax rates and high corporate revenues (relative to GDP) by becoming one of the fi rst few tax havens of choice. However, this is not a feasible strategy for most countries. 2. Th ere are important policy proposals that would counter or eliminate these problems. However, these proposals face important political, legal, and/or technical obstacles. Overcoming these problems would make the taxation of capital inco me at the individual level more attractive, although it would not eliminate the importance of strengthening the corporate layer of taxation, given the large amount of U.S. equity income that is tax exempt. 3. Th ere is ample evidence of an increased role of market power in the U.S. economy; see Philippon (2019) for a full treatment of this concern. 4. Expensing allows companies to write off the full cost of their investment in the year it was made, rather than asking those companies to depreciate the investment over time. Since the expense of making the investment is deductible, the only part of investment income that is taxed is the income above the cost of capital. Furthermore, since debt-fi nanced investments also generate additional interest deductions, those investments receive a tax subsidy under current law. 5. While the interest earned abroad would be taxed, the interest paid at home would be deductible. Th us, if the interest rates are the same, companies would have tax-free access to their off shore funds for investment. 6. While the United States has a large pass-through business sector, corporate tax revenues have been steady despite soaring corporate profi ts. 7. Th e United States is 15.5 percent of the world economy in 2017 if we adjust for price-level diff erences across countries. Th ese purchasing power parity measures account for higher price levels in richer countries, so rich-country purchasing power is lower than it would appear if we simply compare dollar measurements across countries. In contrast, countries like China and India have higher purchasing power than U.S. dollar measures of GDP indicate. 8. As one example, see the post by Steven Rosenthal on the Tax Policy Center's TaxVox blog (Rosenthal 2018). 9. For the purpose of this analysis, I focus on the seven havens of fi gure 2. With country-by-country income, I also include income that is described as stateless. Data sources paint a diff erent picture of the relative importance of haven income, and no data source is perfect. Th ey diff er in terms of how income is defi ned, in terms of what companies are included, and in terms of potential sources of bias or measurement error. Nonetheless, the br oad picture of large amounts of income in haven countries is undisputed. 10. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data are considered some of the best available data for analyzing multinational company profi t shift ing, as discussed in OECD (2015). 11. In contrast, analyses from accounting databases such as Orbis or Compustat omit most profi t shift ing since most income in tax havens is not observable. 12. See Clausing (2019b) for an analysis of the magnitude of profi t shift ing that uses these data. 13. Other studies that suggest very large magnitudes of profi t shift ing include (2018); and Wier and Reynolds (2018). Studies that use accounting databases such as Orbis frequently fi nd smaller magnitudes of profi t shift ing due to the near absence of tax haven da ta in the analysis. Recentl y, Blouin and Robinson (2019) have called into question the large size of some profi t shift ing estimates. However, their method of adjusting the BEA data generat es its own puzzles, including negative amounts of income in some important havens in recent years as well as total stocks of haven income that are incompatible with our knowledge regarding accumulated earnings in such countries. See Clausing (2019b) for a discussion of these issues. 14. Data are from 2017. Th is calculation includes the big seven tax havens referenced in this section as well as other jurisdictions showing eff ective tax rates below 10 percent in 2017. Half of the stateless income is counted in this total, to allow for potential uncertainties regarding how we should interpret that part of this data series. 15. Many provisions in the legislation are temporar y, including the tax cuts fo r individuals, estates, and many pass-through businesses; these provisions expire aft er 2025, and they are not considered Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 277 further here. Th e corporate provisions are permanent, although there are some changes in particular provisions over time. 16. Data are from the U.S. Federal Reserve FRED database (2017-18). Monthly receipt data through December 2018 are aggregated to generate annual totals, which are then compared to GDP . 17. Revenue data are from the Department of the Treasury (n.d.). GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and accessed via the FRED database (BEA 1980-2018). 18. Th is sets aside the revenue from the deemed repa triation tax, which raises revenue in the 10-year window but is a tax break relative to prior law. 19. Th is estimate counts only incremental revenue re lative to JCT estimates of revenue under GILTI for the same period. Th e estimate follows the method described in Clausing (2019b). I assume a 4 percent annual growth rate in foreign profi ts to scale to the 2021-30 budget window, and numbers are nominal following JCT convention. Th is is similar to the revenue estimate in Clausing (2019a), but there are both method and data set diff erences between Clausing (2019a) and Clausing diff erence in the 10-year revenue number is due to scaling for nominal growth in foreign profi ts, since the Clausing (2019a) estimate of $340 billion simply multiplied a 2016 number by 10, whereas this number accounts for 4 percent nominal growth between 2016 and 2030. 20. Th ere is a 10-year gain of $127 billion, using JCT estimates for 2021-27 and adding three more years at the average of the 2026 and 2027 numbers. (Th at was also the method for calculating the lost GILTI revenue.) In addition, for FDII I multiply by the ratio (28/21) to account for the higher corporate tax rate. 21. See Clausing (2019b, 2019c). 22. See Clausing (2019a) for a thorough review of the evidence. 23. A global minimum at 28 percent will increase U.S. revenue relative to a 21 percent per country minimum for those companies with many haven operations and little high-tax foreign income. However, since cross-crediting would reduce minimum tax due for companies with foreign profi ts spread across both high- and low-tax countries, their minimum tax payments to the U.S. government may be lower than under a 21 percent per country minimum. Th us, the relative revenue consequences of these two minimum taxes are unclear. One common criticism of minimum taxes is that they would encourage other countries to match the minimum tax rate. However, this is a feature of the policy: With rates harmoniz ed, there would be no incentive to shift profi ts or business operations for tax purposes. 24. Both prior Treasury regulations (in 2014 and 2016) and the TCJA have reduced the problem of corporate inversions. Under the TCJA there is no longer tax due upon repatriation, so one powerful motive for prior inversions is removed. In addition, the TCJA included other measures to limit inversions, although the GILTI and other features of the tax code still serve as an incentive for corporate inversions. 25. See Clausing (2014); Kleinbard (2014, 2017); and Shay (2014) for a discussion of anti-inversion measures. 26. Th e BEAT is a novel and previously untried provi sion. Experience will inform the path of possible improvements. 27. Both the Obama administration and the House Ways and Means Committee under the Republican leadership of Chairman Camp suggested revenue-n eutral business tax reforms. In fact, these two reforms had many common elements. Both paired a reduction in the corporate rate (to 25 or 28 percent) with revenue-raising provisions aff ecting the international income of multinational companies. 28. Regarding the administration claims, see White House (2017). For a thorough review of the economics literature on this question, the ev idence of other countries who have undertaken similar reforms, and the early evidence from th e experience under TCJA, see Clausing (2019a). 29. See Clausing (2019a) for a thorough discussion. 30. For example, Congress should reverse the repeal of the health insurance mandate, which reduced the subsidization of health insurance for low-in come Americans, thus increasing the uninsured population and raising insurance premium s throughout the health-care system. 31. Other formula choices are discussed below. 32. Th is replaces the need for a permanent establishm ent threshold to determine whether a company is taxable in the jurisdiction. Th e OECD has suggested similar changes, discussed below. Kimberly Clausing 278 33. Th ere are other options. For example, the tax base could instead be defi ned to follow companies' headquarters country tax base defi nitions, or it could be defi ned by multilateral agreement, perhaps following international accounting standards. See also endnote 36. 34. Th is is simpler than grouping companies based on lines of business. Th e distinction is discussed further below. 35. For a discussion of India's proposal, see Avi-Y onah (2019). 36. One approach is to defi ne global income based on the home government of the multinational company in question. Th us, U.S. multinational companies would use the U.S. government defi nition of the tax base, applying it to the entire multinational enterprise. Since U.S. multinational companies already have to calculate earnings and profi ts of controlled foreign corporations for purposes of Subpart F and the foreign tax credit, there wou ld be little additional administrative burden. In the presence of a multilateral agreement, countries could also agree to a common defi nition of the tax base, perhaps relying on international accoun ting standards. Use of international accounting standards would have the advantage of more closely aligning book and tax profi t, reducing the overstatement of the former and th e understatement of the latter. 37. See Crivelli, de Mooij, and Keen (2016) and International Monetary Fund (IMF; 2019) for more on developing-country revenue losses due to profi t shift ing. Th e IMF paper indicates that emerging and developing economies would gain from many, but not all, formulary approaches. In the case of U.S. multinational companies, 2015 BEA data on U.S. multinational companies indicate that developing countries gain under virtually any formula. Th e major developing countries in the survey include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colomb ia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Th ailand, Turkey, and Venezuela. In 2015 the sh are of foreign direct investment earnings of U.S. affi liates in these countries was 8.5 percent aft er-tax and 12 percent before-tax. Such shares are far lower than the share of real activit ies in these countries; the less-developed countries host 22 percent of sales, 48 percent of employment, and 22 percent of employee compensation. (Asset shares are more in line with income shares, but they may be distorted by the infl uence of profi t- shift ing incentives on asset measurement.) 38. In fact, the same dynamic holds even if the United States is the sole adopter. But because such a move would put tremendous tax pressure on trading partner tax bases, and because there would be a greater risk of double taxation, or nontaxation, with unilateral adoption, it is both better economics and better politics to go forward with partner countries. 39. Altshuler and Grubert (2010) perform simulations that suggest that formulary apportionment could lead to tax responsiveness that is similar to the present system. However, data based on the actual past experience under formulary systems suggest that formula factors are far less tax- responsive than are paper profi ts. See Clausing (2016) and Mintz and Smart (2004). 40. In particular, the rule we su ggest is, \" Goods, serv ices or intangibles which are sold or licensed to an unrelated person will be presumed for purposes of this section to have been sold or licensed for use, consumption, or disposition in the country of destination of the property sold or services or intangibles provided; for such purpose, the occurrence in a country of a temporary interruption in shipment of goods shall not constitute such country the country of destination. However, if at the time of a sale of personal property or services or license of intangibles to an unrelated person the enterprise knew, or should have known fr om the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the property, services or intangibles probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of destination, the en terprise must determine the country of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition of the property, services or intangibles or the property, services or intangibles will be presumed to have been used, consumed, or disposed of in the United States\" (849). 41. One possible response to this problem would be to apply formulary apportionment by line of business rather than by common control. Th is solution would lead to much additional complexity; if the underlying tax responsiveness of merger activity is low, such complexity may not be warranted. For this reason, I suggest basing formulary apportionment on common control. 42. Financial accounting data of particular companies indicate that both technology and pharmaceutical companies are particularly likely to see their eff ective tax rates rise in the wake of such reforms. For example, see Kiernan (2019). Taxing Multinational Companies in the 21st Century 279 43. See, e.g., Avi-Y onah and Clausing (2008, 2019). One item that has changed since the 2008 article is that there is now a consensus that treaties need to be changed to eliminate the permanent establishment requirement. 44. See Wier and Reynolds (2018) regarding the high concentration of profi t shift ing among the largest companies. 45. See Avi-Y onah and Clausing (2017) for a lengthier discussion of this DBCFT proposal. 46. Th is is not a small matter. Th e tax would not have worked as intended without the border adjustment. Th ere would be large tax avoidance opportunities. 47. Gopinath (2017) argues that, even in theory, such border adjustment taxes are unlikely to be neutral in either the short run or the long run. For more on the utter unpredictability of exchange rates, see Rogoff (1999), who notes, \"Th e extent to which monetary models, or indeed, any existing structural models of exchange rates, fail to explain even medium-term volatility is diffi cult to overstate. Th e out-of-sample forecasting performance of the models is so mediocre that at horizons of one month to two years they fail to outperform a na\u00efve random walk model (which says that the best forecast of any future exchange rate is today's rate). Almost incredibly, this result holds even when the model forecasts are based on actual realized values of the explanatory variables\" (444). 48. Even assuming perfect exchange rate adjustment, such that the U.S. dollar appreciates exactly and instantly, that adjustment still poses serious threats to the world economy. Since many debts worldwide are dollar denominated, a large dollar appreciation harms many emerging economies as their debt burdens rise in domestic terms. In addition, since many countries target (implicitly or explicitly) the value of their currency relative to the dollar, dollar appreciation creates adjustment diffi culties in other countries. Dollar appreciation would also cause a large redistribution of foreign asset wealth away from Americans and toward foreigners. Th e value of foreign-owned assets in the United States would rise, whereas the dollar value of U.S.-owned foreign assets abroad would fall for American investors. 49. For example, U.S. export income goes untaxed at home and may also be untaxed abroad, whereas foreign companies selling into the U.S. market may be double-taxed on that income. 50. Th e OECD (2019a) also envisions measures to ensure a minimum level of tax as part of its work addressing the tax challenges of the digital economy. Th at work is still in progress and is designed to focus on a subset of multinational companies. 51. For the United States, one possible rule is that a U.S. resident company would be defi ned to include both U.S.-incorporated fi rms and foreign fi rms with their mind and management in the United States. Foreign fi rms that have some managerial presence in the United States and that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency would face a rebuttable presumption that they are U.S. fi rms. See Kleinbard (2017). 52. For example, raising capital gains tax rates does not raise much additional revenue since it generates an increased lock-in problem, whereby individuals ar e incentivized to hold assets too long, or even until death, to benefi t from tax deferral and/or the step-up in basis at death. Mark-to-market taxation addresses that problem, but it comes with important technical diffi culties regarding valuation, liquidity issues, and losses. A wealth tax provides another mechanism for taxing capital income, but in addition to similar technical diffi culties, it will undoubtedly be challenged on constitutionality grounds (regardless of the meri ts), so back-up plans should be included in any such proposal, as suggested by Gamage (2019). 53. Capital taxation is not just about equity, but it is also about effi ciency. Th e present corporate tax largely exempts the normal return to capital from taxation and even subsidizes debt-fi nanced investment. In this context, much capital income actually refl ects above-normal returns to capital due to risk, luck, rents, or some combination. Th ere are strong effi ciency arguments for improving the taxation of these above-normal returns to ca pital. Recent literature has also suggested good arguments for higher taxes on the normal return to capital. For example, see Conesa, Kitao, and Krueger (2009); Farhi et al. (2012); and Saez (2012, 2013). 54. Th is number includes some minor international provisions that are not discussed here. Together, the four international provisions discussed here lose $25 billion over 10 years. 55. Th is analysis is preliminary and based on an incomplete sample of companies' 10-K fi nancial statement data. Horst (2019) fi nds that the combined eff ect of the GILTI, FDII and BEAT is negative. If this fi nding proves generally true, this is a far more negative outcome than predicted by the JCT, Kimberly Clausing 280 which indicated a combined revenue eff ect from the three provisions of almost $200 billion over 10 years. Horst (2019) fi nds that BEAT will raise far less revenue than expected, the FDII will cost more revenue than anticipated, and the GILTI will likely raises somewhat more revenue than anticipated. 56. Th is sets to one side the deemed repatriation revenue during the 10-year budget window, which is a tax cut relative to prior law, even if it raises revenue during the window. 57. Th e eff ects of the GILTI can be complicated by the circumstances of individual companies regarding expense allocation rules, the eff ects of losses, and so on. Th ere have been many instances of companies complaining that expense allocation rules caused them to fall prey to the GILTI minimum tax despite having relatively high foreign eff ective tax rates. However, it is important to remember that expense allocation rules themselves are meant to counter the artifi cial infl ating of foreign income relative to U.S. income due to booking expenses in the United States rather than the foreign country. So, although expense allocation rules may reduce some companies' abilities to use foreign tax credits to off set GILTI, that result may follow from artifi cially high foreign income. In addition, Treasury regulations have been responsive to the concerns of companies and blunted these sorts of eff ects (Rubin 2019). 58. Tax rates rise in 2026 from 10.5 percent to 13.125 percent. In addition, some haven income will be taxed at more than 10.5 percent (up to 13.125 percent) since foreign tax credits are only partially creditable. See Clausing (2019c) for a full description. 59. For companies facing the GILTI, the marginal tax rate associated with non-haven income becomes 10.5 + 0.2 t f, where tf is the foreign tax rate. Th is rate is lower than the new U.S. rate of 21 percent for all foreign tax rates below 52.5 percent. For example, consider the marginal eff ect of earning a dollar in Korea, where the tax rate is 25 percent. Th is dollar generates an additional 10.5 cents in GILTI liability, and 25 cents in tax payable to the Korean government. But 80 percent of the Korean tax payments are creditable against haven GILTI liability, reducing those taxes by 20 cents. Th e next eff ect is 15.5 cents in tax, or .105 + .2 t f. 60. However, the eff ects of the U.S. minimum tax on foreign non-haven tax countries are similar, regardless of whether a per country or global minimum tax is adopted. Th e global minimum tax helps foreign non-haven countries by blunting the tax responsiveness of U.S. multinational companies to their higher tax rates; a per country minimum tax does not have such an eff ect. However, the per country minimum tax reduces profi t shift ing to havens more eff ectively, which helps all non-haven countries recover tax base relative to havens.

In addition, it would expand incentives for new investment by allowing businesses to expense all their investment costs and get a nearly 50 percent larger credit for their research and development spending. Th e proposal would raise the long run level of GDP by at least 5.8 percent, adding at least 0.2 percentage point to annual GDP growth over the next decade. Th e combination of tax increases and additional growth would raise $1.1 trillion over the next decade and 1.1 percent of GDP in steady-state. Th e middle quintile of the income distribution would see a 3.5 percent increase in its aft er-tax income aft er taking into account the uses of the money raised. Th e overall gain to society in the long run would be about a 5.0 percent increase in well-being. Introduction Th e U.S. business tax code was overhauled in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Some changes were improvements and others created new problems. Th is chapter does not relitigate whether that overhaul improved o r w o r s e n e d t h e t a x c o d e o n b a l a n c e . I n s t e a d , i t s t a r t s f r o m t o d a y ' s business tax code and looks ahead to propose a specifi c set of reforms that, implemented together, would both raise more revenue and increase economic growth.How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code Jason Furman, Harvard University and Peterson Institute for International EconomicsJason Furman 286 Th e key insight motivating this proposal is that much of the economic effi ciency associated with the business tax code depends on the tax base and not on statutory tax rates . With a reformed tax base that expands incentives for new investment as well as for research and development (R&D), it is possible to increase statutory tax rates in a way that raises more revenue from past investment decisions and their future profi t windfalls (i.e., the so-called \"supernormal\" return) while cutting the tax rate on the portion of the return that businesses use in evaluating whether to make new investments or undertake R&D (i.e., the so-called \"normal\" return). Th is is the opposite of the traditional tax reform mantra to broaden the base and lower the rates. Instead, going forward tax policy should improve the tax base, which would enable more effi cient increases in tax rates. Th e proposal has fi ve elements: (i) allowing businesses to expense all of their investments in equipment, structures, and intangibles while eliminating the interest deduction; (ii) raising the corporate rate to 28 percent; (iii) requiring mandatory fi ling as C corporations for large businesses; (iv) eliminating other corporate loopholes, including the so-called extenders; and (v) expanding the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit. Th e international aspects of the corporate tax code should also be reformed but the specifi cs of these reforms are outside the scope of this chapter, which focuses only on the domestic components of reform. For the international aspects, see Clausing (2020) in this volume. Th e proposal would encompass both business income that is currently taxed through the corporate income tax as well as business income taxed through the individual income tax, which is used for pass-through corporations like sole proprietors, partnerships, and S corporations. Th us, the proposal addresses the taxation of business income broadly, and not just taxation of C corporation income. Given the current ability of companies to choose which system they are taxed under\u2014an ability this proposal would remove\u2014it is essential to consider business taxation as a whole, and not just corporate tax reform by itself. Th e remainder of this chapter uses the terms \"corporate\" and \"business\" interchangeably. Th e proposed reform would increase the annualized GDP growth rate over the next decade by at least 0.2 percentage point, increasing the long run level of output in the economy by at least 5.8 percent (both relative to current law). 1 In addition, if enacted in 2021 it would raise $300 billion in revenue from 2021 through 2030, not counting macroeconomic feedback, and $1.1 trillion with macroeconomic feedback. In steady-state, revenue would increase by 1.1 percent of GDP (including macroeconomic feedback), the equivalent of $3 trillion over the next decade.

T a ki n g i n t o a c c o u n t t h e s p e c i fi cs of the tax proposal and the wage eff ects, the bottom four quintiles would all see increases in their aft er-tax incomes while the top 0.1 percent would see a 3.8 percent decline. Also taking into account the use of the revenue, assuming that it is given out in equal lump sum amounts to every tax unit, the bottom quintile would see a 9.9 percent increase in its aft er-tax income, and the middle quintile would see a 3.5 percent increase in its aft er-tax income. Th e total gains to society, measured by summing the percentage changes for individual households, would be about a 5.0 percent increase in well-being. The Challenge Th e business tax code has fi ve signifi cant shortcomings: (i) It is unstable in that it is part of an overall tax system that does not raise suffi cient revenue t o m e e t t h e c u r r e n t s p e n d i n g t r a j e c t o r y . ( i i ) I t i s u n s t a b l e i n t h a t i t h a s numerous provisions that are phasing in and out, complicating business planning and fi s c a l p l a n n i n g . ( i i i ) I t i s d i s t o r t i o n a r y , t a x i n g d i ff erent activities at very diff erent rates depending on the form of investment, the fi nancing of the investment, and other factors. (iv) It does not fully refl ect the positive externality associated with R&D. And (v) it does not suffi ciently address the rents associated with increased concentration and expanded monopoly power. Th ese shortcomings are more fully described in turn in this section. THE UNITED STATES COLLECTS ABOUT THE LOWEST CORPORATE REVENUE IN HISTORY AND AMONG THE ADVANCED ECONOMIES In 2018 the United States collected 1 percent of its GDP from corporate income taxes, a number that is projected to rise slightly over the next decade, assuming a number of tax increases phase in (see \"Th e Proposal\"). As shown in fi gure 1a, this is the lowest since the 1930s (outside of the recessions or their immediate aft ermaths), and, as shown in fi gure 1b, it is lower than all but one of the advanced economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). U.S. corporate taxes are less than half their historic average and one third the unweighted average for other advanced OECD economies. Note that these fi gures do not account for tax revenue from pass-through businesses collected through the individual income tax code which is likely higher than it was in the past and is higher than it is in other countries.Jason Furman 288 FIGURE 1A.

By 2029 revenue will be 4 percent of GDP lower than noninterest spending. If this gap did not change, it would be consistent with the debt eventually rising to about 400 percent of GDP. I t i s l i k e l y t h a t f u t u r e p o l i c y m a k e r s w o u l d \u2014 a n d s h o u l d \u2014 a c t t o p r e v e n t debt rising to 400 percent of GDP. It is uncertain, however, what steps they will take, and whether they would include further changes to corporate or other business taxes. As a result, the fi scal imbalance itself is an indirect source of uncertainty about future business taxes. NUMEROUS PROVISIONS OF THE BUSINESS TAX CODE ARE PHASING IN, EXPIRING, OR PHASING OUT U n d e r c u r r e n t l a w , t h e t a x a t i o n o f b u s i n e s s i n c o m e w i l l c h a n g e a l m o s t every year between now and 2027. By itself, this is a source of complexity. Th is complexity is compounded by the political uncertainty associated with whether or not future Congresses will try to undo some or even all of these changes. A partial list of scheduled changes in the taxation of business income include these: Currently businesses are allowed to expense their equipment investment\u2014that is, to deduct 100 percent of the cost in the year they make the investment. For most investments, the percentage that can be expensed is reduced to 80 percent in 2023, 60 percent in 2024, 40 percent in 2025, 20 percent in 2026, and will be phased out completely starting in 2027. In the case of R&D expenditures, the current expensing provision ends aft er 202 1 . A t tha t po in t b us in esses will ha v e t o am o rtize th eir R &D expenditures over fi ve years in some cases and fi ft een years in others. Currently households can take a 20 percent deduction on certain qualifi ed business income from pass-through businesses. Th is provision expires aft er 2025. Th e tax rate on global intangible low-taxed income increases starting in 2026.Jason Furman 290 Currently businesses are limited to a net interest deduction of 30 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, but starting in 2022, this limit applies to earnings before interest and taxes. Dozens of provisions in the tax code, the so-called extenders, expire at the end of 2020; these expiring provisions include the classifi cation of certain race horses as three-year property, the seven-year recovery period for motorsports entertainment complexes (i.e., NASCAR), and numerous energy tax incentives. As a result, starting in 2026 the business tax code is scheduled to be very diff e r e n t f r o m w h a t i t i s t o d a y . P a s t e x p e r i e n c e , h o w e v e r , s h o w s t h a t i n some cases the government extends current practices and in other cases it does not, with the diff erence oft en refl ecting questions of lobbying power and other arbitrary considerations rather than effi ciency. In sum, the business tax code as written creates substantial direct uncertainty, which is compounded by the indirect uncertainty that results from having revenue levels much lower than spending. THE BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM DISTORTS DECISION MAKING WITH NON-NEUTRAL TAX RATES Th ere is substantial debate over the total level of taxation and over the specifi c level of taxation on capital income. Th ere is much less debate over the principle of neutrality in the tax code, the idea that whatever the level of taxes, it should be similar for similar activities. 2 If the tax system is not neutral, then it results in relatively too much of tax -favored activities and r e l a t i v e l y t o o l i t t l e o f t a x - d i s f a v o r e d a c t i v i t i e s . I n t h i s s i t u a t i o n , m o v i n g the tax system toward neutrality with respect to diff erent activities will improve effi ciency for a given level of revenue collection. Currently the tax code is non-neutral with respect to the types of investment, the fi nancing of investment, the form of business, and the location of investment. Th e following briefl y discusses the fi rst three forms of distortions; for an account of how the corporate tax system distorts choices about actual and reported business locations see Clausing (2020) in this volume. Th e fi rst form of distortion is when diff erent types of investment are taxed at very diff erent rates. Diff erent industries face very diff erent average tax rates in 2022, varying from a low of a 10 percent eff ective rate for holding companies and for accommodation and food services, to a high of a 23 percent tax rate for agriculture, forestry, fi shing and hunting, and health care and social assistance (Penn Wharton Budget Model 2017; see table 1). How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 291 Similarly, the tax rates on intangibles are generally lower than tax rates on tangible assets, with wide variations in the eff ective tax rates on diff erent types of intangibles (Congressional Budget Offi ce [CBO] 2018a; see table 2). Th e second form of distortion is when eff ective marginal tax rates are lower for equipment than they are for structures, and lower for debt fi nancing than for equity fi nancing. See table 3, which is based on calculations from the model developed in Barro and Furman (2018).TABLE 1.

Note: All intangible assets includes the R&E tax credit. TABLE 3. Effective Marginal Tax Rates on Corporate Investment Source: Author's calculations based on Barro and Furman 2018. Finally, the third form of distortion is when tax rates on businesses organized as pass-throughs are much lower than tax rates on C corporations. Th e two rates are relatively similar at the entity level\u2014in 2027 corporations face a 0.5-percentage-point higher tax rate than pass-throughs if all of the provisions of the TCJA are made permanent, and 1.8 percentage points lower rate if they are not (Foertsch 2018). 3 Moreover, corporate income f a c e s a s e c o n d l e v e l o f i n d i v i d u a l t a x a t i o n a t a r a t e o f 2 3 . 8 p e r c e n t o n dividends and capital gains for taxable shareholders that realize their gains, which, even aft er taking into account nontaxable shareholders, still results in a substantially higher tax rate on an integrated basis for corporate capital than for noncorporate capital. 100% Debt 100% Equity Law While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 293 THE EXISTING SYSTEM DOES NOT FULLY REFLECT THE POSITIVE SPILLOVERS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS R&D Th e principle of neutrality applies to activities that, ex ante, there is no r e a s o n f o r p u b l i c p o l i c y m a k e r s t o c o n s i d e r a n y d i ff erently than would investors making business judgements based on market rates of return. One activity, however, is likely to have very large returns that go beyond what is captured solely by investors: investments in R&D. In recognition of this evidence, the United States was the fi rst country in the world to enact a tax credit for R&D, originally passing it in 1981. Since then, most other major economies have passed even more generous measures; as a result, government tax support for R&D is much lower in the United States than it is in many other advanced economies and falls below the (unweighted) average for the advanced OECD countries (see fi gure 2). In addition, th e U .S. r esear ch cr edi t is co m p li ca ted, o ff ering fi rms the options of two diff erent calculations, with other calculations for diff erent circumstances. Recent empirical analyses that attempt to measure spillover eff ects suggest that the socially optimal level of R&D investment\u2014the amount that would produce the greatest rate of economic growth\u2014is two to four times greater than actual spending (Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen 2013; Jones and Williams 1998). While much of this shortfall relative to the optimum FIGURE 2. Government Tax Support for R&D in Advanced OECD Economies Source: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2019a.

While private solutions do not work, public ones can be highly eff ective. For example, research by Hall (1993) and Hines (1994), as well as Bloom, Griffi th, and Van Reenan (2002) has found that research credits are highly eff ective at increasing research spending: Each dollar of forgone tax revenue due to the credit generally leads fi rms to invest at least one dollar in R&D, with some studies fi nding much larger eff ects. Th ese studies, among others, fi nd elasticities of roughly one and oft en as high as two. Akcigit, Hanley , and Stantcheva (2019) estimate the optimal subsidy for research; while their estimate diff ers from the current framework for the research credit, it justifi es a substantial subsidy\u2014one that appears to be larger than the one currently in the law. THE TAX SYSTEM CAN PLAY A ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED CONCENTRATION IN THE ECONOMY Several economists have documented the degree to which concentration has increased throughout the economy as fewer and fewer companies h a v e c o m e t o d o m i n a t e a n i n c r e a s i n g n u m b e r o f i n d u s t r i e s ( F u r m a n and 2018; White House 2016). Increased concentration can refl ect good causes such as greater effi ciency, as well as bad causes such as increased permissiveness of mergers and acquisitions. One manifestation of the increase in concentration is the rise in the rate of return on capital relative to the safe rate of return on assets, a fact that is not fully explained by increases in intangible investment or other obvious factors (Eggertsson, Robbins, and Getz Wold 2018; Farhi and Gourio 2018). Th e increase in concentration is contributing to slower productivity growth and potentially also increased inequality through lower investment, less innovation, and more inequality. Th e policy responses to increased concentration should be in a wide range of domains, like antitrust policy and regulatory policy. But this fact also has implications for tax policy. To the degree that fi rms are getting larger monopoly returns, taxing these will not distort the economy\u2014they are \"rents\". While a fi rm would like as much of them as possible, they are in excess of the amount needed to get to undertake the investment they did. In fact, this taxation might be a way to curb monopoly power, increase competition in the economy; as a result, higher tax rates on the portion of the return associated with monopoly could even be effi ciency increasing.How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 295 The Proposal Th e proposal is designed to address these fi ve challenges. It would raise additional revenue, helping to make the tax code more sustainable and thus more predictable. All of the elements of the proposal would be permanent, eliminating the uncertainty associated with phase-ins, phase-outs, and cliff s in the current code. It would make the tax system more neutral, especially with regards to decisions about fi nancing with debt and equity. It would increase the tax benefi ts associated with investments in R&D, helping businesses to internalize the social benefi ts they currently create with their research and thus to undertake more of it. Finally, it would generally eliminate the taxation of the normal return to capital that all businesses require to make investments (by allowing for expensing of investment) but would greatly increase the taxation of the rents associated with monopoly profi ts or supernormal returns. Th is would help increase effi ciency and would also raise revenue in a very progressive manner. Th e proposal has fi ve elements: (i) expanding expensing to include structures and all intangibles and making it permanent for all business investment while disallowing interest deductions associated with new investment; (ii) raising the corporate rate to 28 percent; (iii) requiring mandatory fi ling as C corporations for large businesses; (iv) eliminating other corporate loopholes, including the so-called extenders; and (v) expanding the R&E tax credit. I n a d d i t i o n , t h i s r e f o r m t o t h e d o m e s t i c p o r t i o n s o f U . S . b u s i n e s s t a x e s should also be accompanied by a reform to the international portions, potentially along the lines of Clausing (2020) in this volume. Ideally, all fi ve elements of the reform would be undertaken together since they form an integrated reform proposal. Th e p r o b l e m s a s s o c i a t e d w i t h s e p a r a t i n g out some elements (e.g., doing expensing without disallowing interest deductions) and the possibility of separating out other elements (e.g., dropping the proposal for an expanded R&E tax credit) are discussed in \"Questions and Concerns\" later in this chapter. For the remainder of the section \"Th e Proposal\" and the next section, \"Analysis of the Proposal,\" the individual elements are treated as a single integrated proposal. EXPAND EXPENSING AND MAKE IT PERMANENT Under current law, investment in equipment\u2014which is about 45 percent of annual business fi xed investment\u2014can immediately be deducted from income for the purpose of calculating taxes. Th i s p r o v i d e s a n i n c e n t i v e for new investments in equipment without conferring any benefi ts on old capital, that is to say investments that have already been made. In fact, under Jason Furman 296 this provision the eff ective marginal tax rate on new business investment fi nanced from equity is zero ( box 1 explains the logic). Th ere are, however, four problems with the way expensing is currently implemented that would be rectifi e d b y t h i s p r o p o s a l . Th e fi rst is that expensing currently applies only to equipment and does not include structures (23 percent of business fi xed investment) and does not apply uniformly to intangible investments (32 percent of business fi xed investment, using the Bureau of Economic Analysis's intellectual property products category). Th e proposal would extend expensing to all of these categories of investment to ensure that diff erent types of investment are not taxed at diff erent rates. BOX 1. Why the Effective Marginal Tax Rate Is Zero When Businesses Can Expense Investment To understand why expensing will result in an eff ective tax rate on marginal investment fi nanced by equity of zero, consider a simple example. Assume that a business has the opportunity to spend $100 to purchase a machine and put it in use to produce $3 annually in profi ts net of other costs. For simplicity, assume the machine does not depreciate and that it produces $3 annually forever. If the business did not face any corporate taxes, then it would have to evaluate whether purchasing this machine was at least as good as the best alternative use of funds, which might be something like investing in U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) bonds. If purchasing the machine was at least as good as the alternative, the business would proceed with the purchase, and otherwise it would not. Consider several cases:1. Th e business faces no corporate taxes. In this case its decision is, by defi nition, unaff ected by the tax system, and if its alternative return is 3 percent or less it will purchase the machine. 2. Th e business faces a 33 percent corporate tax on its profi ts but does not get to expense or depreciate the machine. In this case, the business will keep $2 annually in profi ts. As a result, it would undertake the investment only if Treasuries returned How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 297 2 percent or less, making it less likely for the business to make the investment. At a 50 percent corporate tax rate, it would only undertake the investment if Treasury bonds returned 1.5 percent or less, showing that the higher the tax rate, the more it would discourage investment in items like equipment and structures. 3. Th e business can deduct the full cost of its investment in the fi rst year. Assuming the tax rate was 33 percent, this means that when it buys the machine, its taxes would go down by $33, making the aft er-tax cost of the machine only $67. Th e machine would then produce $2 in aft er-tax profi ts a year. Getting $2 a year from a $67 machine is a 3 percent return. So, the business would buy the machine as long as it did not have alternatives with a greater than 3 percent return. Th is is exactly the same as the reasoning the business would undertake in the absence of taxes. Th e same logic applies regardless of the corporate rate. For example, at a 90 percent corporate rate it would cost the business $10 (aft er taxes) to purchase the machine that would produce $0.30 annually (aft er taxes), the same rate of return as without taxes. In other words, with expensing, the corporate tax does not aff ect investment choices, which is the same as saying that the marginal eff ective tax rate is zero. Th e analysis above is for an equity-fi nanced investment. For debt- fi nanced investment the eff ective marginal tax rate is negative. In t h i s c a s e , a s s u m e t h a t t h e b u s i n e s s b o r r o w s $ 1 0 0 t o fi nance the investment and has to pay back $3 annually in interest. Under current law, this interest is tax deductible, completely off setting taxable profi t on the investment. As a result, its aft er-tax rate of return is $3. Assuming a 33 percent corporate tax rate, this $3 aft er- tax return could be purchased for only $67 in the aft er-tax cost of the machinery. As a result, it would undertake the investment even if it had alternative options off ering as high as a 4.5 percent rate of return. Th is means it would undertake the investment, even when it may not make broader economic sense to do so, just for the tax benefi ts. Alternatively, if a fi rm merges with another, thereby generating m a r k e t p o w e r t h a t w i l l a l l o w i t t o i n c r e a s e p r o fi ts, there is no Jason Furman 298 Th e second problem is that expensing currently starts to phase out in 2023 and is gone entirely starting in 2027 . Th e proposal would make expensing for all categories of equipment, structures, and intangibles permanent.4 Th ird, a fi rm that has no tax liability to use for expensing eff ectively gets a less valuable tax incentive because its deductions are carried forward without interest, which raises the cost of investment for start-ups and other loss-making businesses. Th is proposal would carry forward those deductions with the interest rate on Treasury bonds, which eff ectively makes them as valuable as getting upfront cash\u2014which is necessary to make the eff ective marginal tax rate zero\u2014while protecting against the possibility of abuse that could occur if businesses could get the cash upfront. Th e fi nal problem with expensing under current law is that the combination of expensing and the deductibility of interest leads to negative eff ective marginal tax rates, as explained in box 1 and as shown in table 3, where the eff ective tax rate on debt-fi nanced investment in equipment assuming expensing is made permanent is -9 percent. In recognition of this point, the TCJA included a limit on the extent of net interest deductions to 30 percent of earnings (with the defi nition of earnings changing under the law, as described above). Some businesses would have no interest deductions available for marginal investment and thus would not benefi t from this negative eff ective tax rate. Other businesses would fall below this cap and as a result would get full deductibility of interest at the margin and thus very negative eff ective tax rates. If expensing is intended to be a temporary stimulus provision, as it was in 2010 and 2011, then this n eg a tiv e ra te ma y n o t be as m u ch o f a p r o b l e m. T o make expe ns in g permanent and extend it to all business investment, however, would make this a nearly fatal problem.i n v e s t m e n t t o e x p e n s e . I n t h i s c a s e t h e a d d i t i o n a l p r o fi ts, or supernormal profi ts, would all be taxed at the statutory rate. Th e logic in this box captures the most important aspects of how the tax system aff ects choices about business investment, but some additional nuances and caveats are discussed in the subsection \"Raise the Corporate Tax Rate to 28 Percent\" on how to set the corporate rate.How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 299 Th e solution is to limit the deductibility of interest, not to 30 percent of earnings but entirely limit it. Th is was proposed, together with expensing, as part of the Better Way plan developed by the House Republicans (Ryan 2016). Similarly, the Growth and Investment Tax Plan of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform (2005) included another version of expensing and limiting interest deductions. RAISE THE CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 28 PERCENT Once a tax system has expensing and interest deductions have been eliminated, the corporate tax rate does not matter for business investment a n d t h u s i n c r e a s i n g i t h a s n o a d v e r s e i m p a c t o n e c o n o m i c e ffi ciency or economic growth. Eff ectively, in an economy with expensing the tax rate on the \"normal\" portion of investment\u2014the return equal to the next-best alternative the fi rm had\u2014is zero. Th e entire tax falls on the \"supernormal\" portion of the return, which is to say the rents and returns to monopoly profi ts. Taxing this supernormal portion is a loss for the fi rm, which cares about its average tax rate for its overall profi tability, but is not a loss that would aff ect its decision making for new investment, which is determined by its marginal tax rate. Relatedly, a portion of revenue from the increased tax rate applies to existing capital. Th is would have no distortionary eff ect because it is based on decisions that have already been made. In contrast, none of the cost of expensing is associated with tax cuts for past investments. Th is logic also is refl ected in the model that is used for the macroeconomic analysis in the next section, which is taken from Barro and Furman (2018). As Barro and Furman showed, a tax system with expensing plus higher tax rates results in higher growth rates than one without expensing but with lower tax rates. What is the basis for picking a corporate tax rate? And why not raise the corporate tax rate to 90 percent or even higher? Th e concerns with a higher tax rate all lie outside the model itself. Th e incentives to undertake a costly and wasteful tax avoidance opportunity rise with the statutory tax rate not the eff ective tax rate. In the hypothetical example described in box 1, with a 90 percent tax rate the aft er-tax cost of the machine is $10 and the fi rm pays a 90 percent tax on its $3 annual return. Anything it could do to lower that tax, for example by making it appear to have only made a profi t of $2 annually, will have a potentially enormous impact on its aft er-tax rate of return. Some of the avoidance strategies that fi rms could use involve shift ing profi ts overseas to be taxed at the rates of other countries. To the degree that the U.S. statutory rate is very diff erent from the statutory rate in other Jason Furman 300 countries, that would exacerbate these pressures. An eff ective international tax regime can minimize the ability of fi rms to shift income, but even the most eff ective system would likely break down in the face of huge statutory rate diff erentials. More eff ective international taxation creates some room for divergence in rates, but not unlimited room. Even absent considerations of tax avoidance, there are some reasons to believe that actual business investment decisions could be aff ected by higher tax rates. Business leaders generally report ignoring the impact of the tax treatment on cost recovery in their decision making (Batchelder 2017; Neubig 2006). To the degree this is the case, in the example in box 1 they would perceive the machine as costing $100, and not as having its aft er- tax cost. As a result, the higher the tax rate, the lower their perceived aft er- tax returns and the less likely they would be to undertake the investment. Finally, there may be a rational basis for some business decisions to be based on average tax rates instead of eff ective marginal tax rates. Specifi cally, Devereux and Griffi th (1998) analyze the case of large, lumpy international location decisions. Unlike the case where a fi rm is making a decision about a marginal adjustment in its investment, in this case the question is where it will get the highest aft er-tax profi ts from its location decision. Like the avoidance issues, this too depends on diff erences in average rates and also on the way that international income is taxed. Moreover, modeling (not shown in this chapter) fi nds that this eff ect is likely small compared to the eff ects of changing marginal rates. Nevertheless, as the statutory tax rate rose it would become larger. In summary, the model that is used in Barro and Furman (2018) and that is commonly used for the macroeconomic analysis of tax plans gives no guidance on the tax rate\u2014and, in fact, suggests that higher rates will result i n h i g h e r r e v e n u e , e n a b l i n g o t h e r p r o d u c t i v e s p e n d i n g o r r e d u c t i o n s i n other distortionary taxes, and thus be welfare enhancing. Nevertheless, considerations from outside the model strongly suggest that there are downsides to higher tax rates. Taking this all together, there is no good scientifi c way to determine the optimal tax rate. Th e 28 percent proposed in this plan is a reasonable guess but additional work could potentially refi n e t h i s r a t e . I t i s n o t m u c h h i g h e r t h a n the 25 percent tax rate called for by the main large business lobbying association, the Business Roundtable. As shown in fi g u r e 3 , 2 8 p e r c e n t is similar to but on the high end of the tax rate in other large advanced economies, something that is appropriate for an economy the size of the U.S. economy. Moreover, if the rate increase were done in conjunction with more eff ective international tax rules, it might not raise any additional How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 301 issues. It is certainly plausible that a higher tax rate would be reasonable and would still mean the proposal was growth-increasing and welfare-enhancing. Nevertheless, the considerations above also make it plausible that 28 percent is a reasonable value for the corporate rate, which could then be adjusted based on the actual experience. ELIMINATE THE TAX PREFERENCE FOR PASS-THROUGHS In the United States, companies can elect whether to be taxed through the corporate tax code\u2014with an additional layer of taxes when they distribute profi ts to shareholders\u2014or whether to be taxed at the individual level. As corporate and individual taxes have shift ed o v e r tim e this ch o i ce has resulted in companies shift ing their forms to whatever is more favorable (Goolsbee 1998; Mackie-Mason and Gordon 1997; Prisinzano and Pearce 2018). Th is election reduces revenue, increases complexity, and results in companies making decisions about business form for tax reasons and not for economic reasons. Currently the tax rate is lower for pass-throughs than it is for C corporations. One limited way to make progress on the disparity between the taxation of corporations and pass-throughs would be to repeal the 20 percent deduction for certain business income that was passed as part of the TCJA.

Th e p r o v i s i o n o r i g i n a l l y c o s t $ 4 1 5 b i l l i o n ( J o i n t Committee on Taxation [JCT] 2017). Repealing it would raise money through 2025 under current law and would prevent the additional revenue loss that would result from this provision being made permanent. An even more fundamental solution would be to get to the root of the problem itself\u2014the ability to choose between diff erent tax systems. Th e President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform (2005) convened by President Bush recommended, \"For large businesses that currently are taxed as flow-through entities, such as partnerships, LLCs, and S-corporations, domestic earnings would be subject to tax at the business level. Passive investment vehicles, such as regulated investment companies (RICs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs), would continue to be treated the same as under current law\" (President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, 129). Th eir proposal used a gross receipts threshold of $10 million, which with infl ation would be about $13 million today. A higher threshold, say $25 million, might be more reasonable. In addition, an owner's income would need to be taxed as dividends are today. Assuming a corporate rate of 28 percent and the current 23.8 percent on dividends, this would yield a combined tax rate of 45 percent\u2014similar to the top rate for individual income. ELIMINATE OTHER WASTEFUL CORPORATE LOOPHOLES, INCLUDING TAX EXTENDERS Th e corporate tax code has numerous structural features that are very costly, such as the combination of expensing with interest deductions and the tax treatment of international income. It has far fewer egregious corporate loopholes, measured by their total cost, that are for specifi c interests. According to the JCT (2019), the largest tax expenditures for businesses include two international provisions, accelerated depreciation, small business expensing, the R&E credit, and the low-income housing tax credit. While all of these provisions have pros and cons, none of them meets the commonsense defi nition of \"loophole.\" Nonetheless, the number of rifl e-shot provisions in the tax code, even if they do not add up to a substantial amount of money, are bad public policy and undermine faith in the tax code. As a result, they should be systematically eliminated in any reform plan. Many of them are scheduled to end aft er 2020\u2014such as the extenders that include favorable tax treatment for racehorses and NASCAR tracks\u2014and they should end then, a step that How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 303 would not raise revenue relative to current law but would prevent further loss. In addition, any other loopholes should be eliminated. EXPAND THE TAX INCENTIVE FOR R&D Finally, one way to both increase and simplify the research credit would be to expand one of the ways businesses can calculate the research credit by increasing the alternative simplifi e d c r e d i t r a t e f r o m 1 4 p e r c e n t t o 20 percent. At the same time, the research credit could be simplifi ed by repealing other credits, including the regular base period calculation for the standard credit, the university and energy credits. In addition, the defi ni ti o n o f r e s e ar c h u s e d f o r th e c r e di t s h o ul d b e ali gn e d wi th th e current defi nition of the research that qualifi es for expensing, although this provision would be less important if expensing were expanded. Alternatively, other proposals of similar scale could be considered (see, e.g., Government Accountability Offi ce 2009; Guenther 2016; Rao 2015; Tyson and Linden 2012; U.S. Department of the Treasury 2016). Analysis of the Proposal Ultimately the assessment of any tax proposal should depend on its impact on the well-being of households, or welfare. Some of the critical intermediate information in assessing the eff ect on welfare is the macroeconomic analysis of the eff ect on growth, the analysis of the impact on revenue, and how the tax changes aff ect the distribution of income (Furman 2016; Leiserson 2017). ECONOMIC GROWTH Th e proposal would lower the cost of capital for businesses, leading to more investment and thus a higher steady-state level of output. In the transition to this new steady-state, the proposal would also increase the rate of economic growth. Th e inclusive results of this plan for macroeconomic performance are shown in table 4, with a column comparing the growth eff ects to law as written and one comparing the eff ects to provisions permanent, which is a strong version of current policy that assumes all the provisions in the law today are made permanent. Relative to current law, the proposal would raise the long run level of output by 5.8 percent. Th is would take time as businesses increased investments and capital adjusted to its new trajectory. Over the next decade the result would be about a 0.2-percentage-point increase in the annual growth rate. Th e proposal would also do more for growth than just extending everything in current law, including equipment expensing and the pass-Jason Furman 304 t h r o u g h d e d u c t i o n . R e l a t i v e t o t h i s a l t e r n a t i v e , i t w o u l d a l s o b e a b o u t a 0.2-percentage-point increase in the annual growth rate. (Note in the unrounded numbers this is somewhat smaller than the change relative to current law.) Th is analysis is based on the models and parameters in Barro and Furman (2018) and is similar to the estimated eff e c t s i n t h a t p a p e r ( B a r r o a n d Furman 2018, table 10, p. 38). Th e model divides the economy into fi ve types of capital (equipment, structures, residential, R&D, and other intellectual property) and three sectors (corporate, pass-through, and government/household). Th e supply of capital is infi nitely elastic, corresponding to a small open economy or a long run Ramsey model with off setting eff ects from upward-sloping supply of capital and falling rate of time preference or intertemporal substitution. Th e demand for capital is based on user costs, which depend on the tax treatment of new investment, and the amount of capital is determined in competitive equilibrium. Th e model assumes perfect foresight and an unchanging tax code. Th e long run steady-state increase in the level of output is translated into an annual path for growth by assuming a 5 percent convergence rate to the new steady-state. Most importantly, the corporate tax reform in this chapter is only part of the policy. Th e additional revenue it raises would also be used in some manner that could aff ect economic growth. It could be used for progressive transfers, for public investments, to off set other distortionary taxes, or for debt reduction\u2014in lieu of other tax increases or spending cuts. For any non-revenue-neutral proposal, the way this half of the proposal is specifi e d c a n m a t t e r a s m u c h f o r g r o w t h a s t h e p r o p o s a l i t s e l f m a t t e r s . Th is analysis eff ectively assumes that the proceeds of corporate reform are used to fi nance lump sum transfers to households, which have no eff ect on economic growth. Th is could be a conservative assumption in that many uses of the funds would further add to growth, including if they were used TABLE 4.

Th is neoclassical model is simple, tractable, and yields similar estimates to other modeling strategies. It is also likely a lower bound on growth because it does not include any special role for R&D in the long run level of output or even the trend growth rate of output. In addition, it does not refl ect the additional benefi ts from a more stable, predictable tax code that reduces uncertainty, improves the allocation of capital within categories, and eliminates the bias toward debt fi nancing. On the other hand, it also does not include some of the potential costs of higher rates that were described in \"Th e Proposal.\" On balance, it is a reasonable and likely to be conservative estimate of the macroeconomic impact of the proposal. Th is macroeconomic impact, by itself, does not tell us much about welfare. Th e additional growth is a result of people temporarily reducing their consumption (which reduces utility) or borrowing more from other countries (which must be repaid). Th is is not \"free\" growth but instead refl ects a shift in how current trade-off s are made. Th e macroeconomic impact, however, is relevant, given that this is the analysis of a large discrete change in tax policy and also because it feeds into the revenue estimate. REVENUE Th e proposal raises revenue because although it cuts the tax rate on the normal return to capital, it increases it on the supernormal returns to capital\u2014which represent an increasingly large portion of the total return earned by corporations. Th is chapter does not off er a precise estimate of the gross revenue raised by this proposal but instead off ers a rough, indicative analysis that should be improved by more complete modeling, taking better account of the interactions in the proposal, and fl eshing out some of the details in the proposal. Th e impact on revenue also includes the dynamic analysis that includes not just the direct eff ect of the tax change but also the macroeconomic feedback associated with the increase in GDP and thus other revenues. As in \"Th e Proposal,\" this dynamic analysis eff ectively assumes that the additional revenue is being rebated in a lump sum fashion\u2014so this is an estimate of how much money this proposal generates for American households. Table 5 shows the very rough revenue estimates for the proposal.Excluding macroeconomic feedback, the proposal would raise $300 billion the fi rst decade. Taking into account the increase in economic growth, Jason Furman 306 TABLE 5. Estimated Revenue Effects of Proposal Source: Author's calculations, estimates, and extrapolations based on (JCT) 2016. Note: Components may not sum to total due to roundi ng. Permanent expensing and disallow interest deductions is effectively stacked after corporate rate to 28 percent in the revenue table, so it refl ects the interaction with the higher corporate rate.the total revenue raised grows to $1.1 trillion. Even this is a misleadingly small estimate of the total fi scal impact of the proposal. In steady-state the proposal would raise 1.1 percent of GDP in revenue, divided roughly equally between the direct eff ect and the macroeconomic feedback. 5 If this steady-state revenue level had been in eff ect from 2021 onward then the proposal would raise the equivalent of $3 trillion over the next decade. Th e steady-state increase in revenue as a percent of GDP is higher than the amount of revenue raised over the 10 years in part because permanent expensing and disallowing interest deductions loses money in the fi rst decade but raises money over the longer run. Th is happens because the 10-year budget window shows much of the gross cost of expensing (which is immediate) but does not show much of the partially off setting gross savings (lost depreciation deductions, many of which fall outside the window). Similarly, the disallowance of interest deductions applies only to new investments, so it grows over time. In addition, the macroeconomic feedback grows over time as the capital stock grows to its new, higher steady-state trajectory.

Th e distributional impact of the proposal depends as much on the uses of the revenue as it does on the collection of the revenue itself. Th e d i s t r i b u t i o n o f t h e p r o p o s a l i t s e l f w o u l d , b y d e fi nition, be a tax increase. Th e incidence of this tax increase depends on the assumption of which individuals ultimately bear the corporate tax burden. Th e tables in this analysis follow the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC), which is similar to the Treasury, the JCT, and the CBO, in assuming that corporate taxes are passed through 60 percent to shareholders in the form of smaller dividends or capital gains, 20 percent to all capital owners in the form of lower returns on all economywide assets, and 20 percent to workers in the form of lower wages (Nunns 2012). Under these assumptions, 58 percent of the corporate tax is paid by the top 10 percent of households and 14 percent of the corporate tax is paid by the bottom 60 percent of households. Th e fi rst column of table 6 shows the percent change in aft er-tax income a s a r e s ul t o f th e b u s i n e s s t ax p r o p o s al al o n e , a s s um i n g i t i s d i s t r i b u t e d along the same lines as current corporate taxes and applying the steady-state 0.6 percent of GDP revenue increase (excluding dynamic eff ects) to the baseline for 2025. By itself the proposal is progressive, with the largest changes in aft er-tax income for the highest-income households, a 3.3 percent reduction in aft er-tax income for the top 0.1 percent as compared to a 0.6 percent reduction for the middle quintile, and a 0.3 percent reduction for the bottom quintile. Using the generic distribution of the corporate tax understates the progressivity of this proposal because it reduces the tax rate on the normal return to shareholders, which is borne by owners of capital construed broadly and workers; and increases the tax rate on monopoly profi ts and rents, which is borne by shareholders (Cronin et al. 2012; Nunns 2012). As a result, the proposal would raise wages in the long run and shift the corporate tax burden to shareholders in a highly progressive manner. Relatedly, distribution tables are supposed to refl ect changes in prices and the fi rst column implicitly assumes that wages fall whereas the macroeconomic an al y s i s s h o w s th a t w ag e s ri s e in p r o p o rti o n t o G D P . Co l umn 2 o f ta b l e 6 attempts to refl ect these eff ects under the ad hoc assumption that the entire burden of the corporate tax falls on holders of corporate equity and also incorporating the increase in wages, using the 2.3 percent increase in wages in 2030 as the basis for what is intended to be a long run, steady-Jason Furman 308 TABLE 6.

Under this analysis, aft er-tax incomes actually rise for the bottom four quintiles as they see wage gains that exceed the increased share of corporate taxes they pay through their capital holding. Th e reduction in aft er-tax incomes for households at the very top of the distribution is slightly larger in this case as well. Th is business tax proposal is only one part of a broader budgetary approach, and this chapter does not explicitly propose a use for the money. As an illustration, this distributional analysis will assume that it is used for lump sum transfers that are equal for each tax unit\u2014the same assumption that was used in the macroeconomic analysis above. To the degree the proceeds were used more progressively, for example to fund income-related transfers, this may understate the progressivity of the proposal. Note that How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 309 the amount of revenue available for lump sum transfers exceeds the burden o f t h e t a x i t s e l f b e c a u s e i t i n c l u d e s n o t j u s t t h i s b u r d e n ( 0 . 6 p e r c e n t o f GDP in steady-state) but also the additional revenue that results from the in c r e as e in G D P ( 0 . 4 p e r c e n t o f G D P in s t e a d y - s t a t e ) . Th e static revenue is used for the distribution table because this refl ects the burden of the tax. Th e additional revenue associated with the dynamic analysis is not a burden because it comes as a result of higher incomes\u2014but it can be a benefi t when it is recycled. As a result, the average household is made better off when the revenue is recycled\u2014with its aft er-tax income rising by 0.7 percent under conventional scoring and 2.2 percent counting the wage increases. Counting the wage increases and the specifi c distribution of the tax, the bottom quintile sees a 9.9 percent increase in its aft er-tax income and the middle quintile sees a 3.5 percent increase in its aft er-tax income. Meanwhile, the top 0.1 percent would see eff ectively the same reductions in its aft er-tax income as it would have absent the lump sum transfers because the transfers are negligible compared to their overall income. WELFARE Th e distributional analysis with lump sum transfers gives a reasonable proxy for an analysis of the impact of the proposal on the well-being of households, as Greg Leiserson has argued (Leiserson 2017). Th is is because it refl ects the direct changes of the tax, the changes in prices like higher wages and lower stock returns, and the impact of the additional revenue generated by the proposal through lump sum transfers. Th e analysis does not include the changes in effi ciency, like the better allocation of capital, the potentially increased growth rate as a result of more R&D, and the benefi ts of a less leveraged tax change. For small tax changes these are negligible compared to the factors included in the distribution tables, but in this case it is a large proposal, so the effi ciency improvements could be fi rst order\u2014 and would mean larger gains than shown in the distributional analysis. Overall, most people gain on average in the analysis refl ecting the details of the proposal and the lump sum transfers. In this case, the average p e r c e n ta g e g ain a c r o s s h o u s e h o l ds t o tal s 5 . 0 p e r c e n t \u2014 m u c h l ar g e r th an the 2.2 percent gain for the average household, as shown in table 7. 6 Th is larger gain corresponds roughly to the improvement in total well-being (or utility) for society, assuming that utility is based on the logarithm of income and that everyone's utility is weighted equally without any special attention to those at the bottom of the income distribution. Eff ectively, averaging percent gains does not ascribe an arbitrary normative meaning to the average of income but instead says that an equal percent increase in income is equally valuable for diff erent households (see Furman 2019). If society is risk averse, the gains are even larger than this.Jason Furman 310 Questions and Concerns Th e proposal raises a number of questions and concerns that are addressed in this section. 1. Do all the parts of the proposal need to be passed together?Many of the parts of the proposal do need to be passed together. Th e most important link is that expensing must be accompanied by eliminating the deductibility of interest; if not, there will be a substantial favoritism for debt-fi nanced investment that will face a lower tax rate. Th e expensing and interest deductibility proposal would raise money in the long run but would lose money over the fi rst decade. As a result, it would at least temporarily compound the revenue problem, making it important to combine it with the proposal for higher corporate rates. All of these proposals raise taxes on C corporations, an eff ect that would be partly undone if companies could freely shift to becoming pass-through entities. As a result, it is important to combine these changes with something that aff ects the taxation of pass-through entities. Th e minimal proposal would be to eliminate the 20 percent deduction, but the ideal would be to eliminate the election entirely. Th e loophole closers are a relatively minor part of the proposal and the expanded research credit could be dropped from the proposal, resulting either in some additional revenue or a similar revenue gain with a smaller increase in the corporate rate. 2. Will this proposal open up new avenues for tax avoidance?Every change in the tax system creates new opportunities for companies to avoid taxes. In many ways, this proposal would minimize those opportunities relative to current law, including completely shutting down the exploitation of diff erences between tax rates on C corporations and pass- throughs. But this would not be a \"set it and forget it\" tax reform; instead, policymakers would need to be vigilant and pass follow-up legislation addressing any unintended loopholes that crop up.TABLE 7. Long Run Aggregate Welfare Gains Percent change for average household 2.2% Average percent change for households 5.0% Source: Author's calculations and extrapolations Based on distributional estimates presented in the fourth column of table 6.How to Increase Growth While Raising Revenue: Reforming the Corporate Tax Code 311 3. How would your proposal handle the ending of interest deductibility for fi nancial institutions? Th e proposal would eliminate the deductibility of net interest, not gross interest, so it would still enable the business model of fi nancial institutions. Additional study should be given to any other rules that would be necessary to refl ect the role that interest plays in the fi nancial sector. 4. Does the proposal need transition rules to give existing businesses time to plan? Th e proposal would apply to businesses going forward, although the tax rate increase would eff ectively raise taxes on the proceeds of past investments. Th ere is no reason that it would need to include any transition rules, phase- ins, or phase-outs. In fact, such rules can add additional complications and political uncertainty. Nevertheless, some of them might be a political price necessary to pass the proposal\u2014as with the 1986 tax reform. 5. What if the growth does not materialize because the cost of capital is already so low that businesses are not likely to increase their investment just because it is lowered further? Th is proposal is designed for the long-term and not as a response to the immediate economic conditions. Moreover, there is no evidence that businesses have changed the way they respond to changes in the cost of capital. Also, the growth eff ects would come not only from the cost of capital but also from increased effi ciency in the allocation of capital across sectors, reduced overleveraging from debt fi nancing, and increased R&D. It is more likely that the model estimates are a lower bound on the growth impact. Th at said, if little or none of the growth materializes, the proposal would still be net revenue increasing\u2014both over the next decade and even more over the long run. It would still be progressive. And if the proceeds were used for lump sum transfers, it would still make the bottom several quintiles of the income distribution better off . So, the main qualitative eff ects would be similar but the magnitude of the benefi ts would be smaller. Conclusion Th is proposal would reform the business tax system by improving the tax base and raising tax rates. Th is combination makes it possible to simultaneously increase growth, aggregate well-being and raise revenue. Th e scope of this chapter was limited to focus on the domestic components of business tax reform, but the international components are essential given the substantial scope for effi ciency-increasing revenue raisers in Jason Furman 312 the international space and the importance of reducing international tax avoidance that could arbitrage the increased gap between U.S. and foreign rates under this proposal. Business tax reform could be done by combining the ideas in this chapter with an international reform, for example as in Clausing (2020). Ultimately, even larger gains would result from integrating these proposals with an overhaul of capital taxation at the individual level, but that is far beyond the scope of the present chapter. Acknowledgments Th e author wishes to thank Willie Powell for going above and beyond his usual outstanding research assistance. As the proposal was developed, I benefi ted from comments from Jay Shambaugh, Ryan Nunn, the rest of Th e Hamilton Project team, and the participants in the author's conference convened by Th e Hamilton Project. Endnotes 1. As discussed below, this estimate just refl ects changes in the cost of capital and associated changes in investment. It does not refl ect the fact that increases in R&D could also increase total factor productivity growth or the benefi ts that reducing the debt-equity diff erence would have for macroeconomic stability and potentially the longer-run level of output as well. As such, these growth estimates are a lower bound. 2. If activities have positive or negative externa lities associated with them then they should be taxed at diff erent rates accordingly. 3. Th e formal name for the TCJA is \" An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Y ear 2018. \" 4. For fast-growing profi table fi rms in particular, expensing can reduce or eliminate tax burden. 5. Th is steady-state uses 2030 for the level of GDP rather than the long run level, to more approximate something like the average steady-state. Th e steady-state for the tax provisions is generally around 2030 or 2030-40. 6. Averaging percent gains is like looking at the change in the mean of log incomes. Th is corresponds to a utilitarian social welfare function with the assumption of log utility. In reality, utility may have more curvature than this (refl ecting greater risk aversion) and society may weight the utility of households at the bottom even more. Th ese considerations would result in an even bigger welfare increase than the 5.0 percent shown in the table.

We propose a suite of tax reforms targeted at improving tax compliance, rationalizing the taxation of corporate profi ts earned domestically and abroad, eliminating preferential treatment of capital gains, and closing tax loopholes and shelters of which wealthy individuals disproportionately avail themselves. We estimate that these proposals have the potential to raise over $4 trillion in the coming decade. Th ese proposals are comparable on the basis of both potential revenue raised and progressivity with newer and more radical proposals, like wealth taxation and mark-to-market reforms, that have been the focus of much recent attention. Importantly, our agenda is likely to enhance rather than reduce effi ciency, is far less costly in terms of political capital, and hews more closely to basic notions of fairness than alternative approaches. Introduction In the coming decades, federal spending will need to grow just to enable the government to continue to provide the services it does today (Summers 2017). Th is is the result of a confl uence of economic forces: an aging society; price increases in the goods the government purchases, like education and health services; potential increases in national security expenditure to keep pace with adversaries; and the growth in inequality, which will require increased spending to ameliorate. Given these realities as well as issues of avoiding excessive federal debt accumulation, progressive tax reform is and should be high on progressives' agenda. Our belief is that the best path forward is through a combination of deterring illegal tax evasion\u2014by investing more in an underfunded Internal Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach Natasha Sarin, University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Wharton School of BusinessLawrence H. Summers, Harvard University Joe Kupferberg, Harvard University and University of PennsylvaniaNatasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 318 Revenue Service (IRS)\u2014and reducing legal tax avoidance by broadening the tax base and closing loopholes that enable the wealthy to decrease their tax liabilities. Th e combination of policies described in this chapter will increase both the effi ciency and progressivity of the U.S. tax system. Our rough estimates in table 1 suggest that these approaches could raise $4 trillion over the course of a decade, more revenue than more extreme alternatives advocated recently, including calls for a 70 percent marginal rate on top earners and wealth tax proposals. Once revenue is raised by progressively broadening the tax base as we propose, more tax revenue may still need to be raised from the wealthy, TABLE 1.

However, we believe that our proposals are the right place to start. Practically, closing loopholes will increase the effi c i e n c y o f i n c r e a s e s i n t o p r a t e s , o r w e a l t h t a x e s , b y making it more diffi cult for individuals and fi rms to shelter income from tax liability. Th e remainder of this chapter proceeds as follows. In the fi rst section, we try to estimate what a progressive tax reform can reasonably expect to c o ll e ct fr o m th o s e a t th e v e ry t o p . W e b as e thi s e x e r c i s e o n e ff ective tax rates paid by the rich and large corporations, today and historically. In the second section, we discuss the substantial magnitude of the tax gap, propose means of shrinking it, and illustrate that an increased focus on tax compliance is a substantially progressive reform. Next, we make the case for other progressive base broadeners, including closing corporate and individual tax shelters, overhauling capital gains taxation, and capping tax deductions for the wealthy. We then compare our approaches to more radical alternatives, like wealth taxation, before concluding the chapter. How Much Can Be Raised from Those at the Top? In recent months, progressives have debated how best to raise tax revenue from high-income individuals to fund necessary government expenditure and investment (Batchelder and Kamin 2019; Saez and Zucman 2019a; Sarin and Summers 2019). A fi rst-order question is how much can be collected by tax reform focused on raising revenue from those at the very top. In 2017, the total adjusted gross income (AGI) of those in the top 1 percent (making $500,000 or more annually) was $2.3 trillion. Total tax collection from this group\u2014through federal income taxes, state and local taxes, and payroll taxes\u2014was $790 billion. 1 Th is constitutes an eff ective tax rate of 34 percent, with $1.5 trillion in AGI that remains untaxed. Auten and Splinter (2019) provide historical data on average eff ective tax ra t es b y fra ctil e fr o m 1 960 t o 20 1 5 .2 Th e Auten and Splinter series sheds light on the important diff erence between maximum marginal tax rates and eff ective tax rates historically. Top marginal federal income tax rates peaked at 91 percent in 1960, when the eff ective income tax rate was under 20 percent. Including other tax categories\u2014like payroll and state and local taxes\u2014the maximum eff ective tax rate on the top 1 percent was 47.4 percent in 2000. Raising the eff ective tax rate on the top 1 percent from its current 3 4 p e r c e n t b y 1 3 . 4 p e r c e n ta g e p o in ts t o r e turn t o thi s p e ak w o ul d r e s ul t in an additional $4.3 trillion in tax collection between 2020 and 2029, as shown in table 2. Similarly, raising the tax rate on those making $1 million Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 320 or more annually from the 2017 level (36 percent) to the historical peak (49 percent) would increase taxes collected from this group by $3 trillion from 2020-29. Increasing corporate income tax liability is another progressive means of raising revenue. In 2017, corporations made $1.4 trillion in taxable income, of which $340 billion was collected through income taxation (a 24 percent eff ective tax rate aft er accounting for corporate tax credits). Since then, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) decreased the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and corporate tax revenue fell by 0.5 percent of GDP (Offi ce of Management and Budget 2019). Th e Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) estimates that a 1 percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate would raise almost $100 billion in a decade (CBO 2018). Extrapolating from this estimate suggests that returning to the 35 percent corporate tax rate would raise $1.4 trillion in additional revenue over a decade. To validate this revenue estimate, note that in 2018 U.S. corporations paid $90 billion less in taxes than they had in 2017 (IRS 2018a). Adjusting for growth and infl ation, an extra $90 billion in 2018 would translate to an extra $1.16 trillion between 2020 and 2029. TABLE 2. Revenue-Raising Potential of Increases in Individual Tax Rates, by Income Category (in Billions of Dollars) Income category Over $500,000 Over $1 millionOver $5 CBO 2019. a Auten and Splinter (2019) report the average tax rate for the top 1 percent, top 0.5 percent, top 0.1 percent, and top 0.01 percent. These do not exactly correspond to our AGI buckets, but they are fairly close. Those making $500,000 or more annually correspond to the top 1 percent, those making $1 million or more annually correspond to the top 0.3 percent, those making $5 million or more annually correspond to the top 0.03 percent, and those making $10 million or more annually correspond to the top 0.01 percent.Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 321 W e estimate that when this change in corporate tax liability is combined with a signifi cant increase in top individual tax rates, more than $4 trillion could be generated from increasing taxes on the individuals at the very top of the income distribution and on the corporations they own (table 3). Returning top individual and corporate tax liability to historical peak levels would raise over 2 percent of U.S. GDP annually. By way of comparison, s u c h a n a p p r o a c h w o u l d i n c r e a s e t a x c o l l e c t i o n b y a l a r g e r a m o u n t ( a s a percentage of GDP) than any changes to the tax code enacted since 1950 (Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget 2016). Th e Clinton administration's 1993 tax increases were similarly focused at raising revenue from high-income earners: they increased the top income tax bracket to 39.6 percent, raised corporate taxes, and made permanent the highest estate and gift tax rates. Combined, these changes\u2014at that time, among the largest tax increases in U.S. history\u2014were estimated to raise 0.7 percent of GDP (Rosenbaum 1993). Raising $4 trillion from high-income earners and corporations represents a tax hike three times as large and is at the upper edge of what we think is feasible. I n r e c e n t m o n t h s , s o m e p r e s i d e n t i a l c a n d i d a t e s h a v e a r g u e d t h a t t h e government's revenue needs can be met by even larger tax increases borne only by the very wealthy. Senator Elizabeth Warren, for example, proposes funding progressive programs like Medicare for All and debt-free college by means of tax increases on the very top, through a broad program that includes wealth taxation, mark-to-market taxation of capital gains, an increase in top tax rates, and payroll tax hikes. Th e cumulative result of these changes would be confi scatory: tax rates over 100 percent on those TABLE 3. Revenue Raised in 2020-29 from Returning Income Tax Rates to Historical Levels Tax source Revenue (trillions) Individual Tax hikes for those making $1 million or more, or $3.0 Tax hikes for those making $500,000 or more Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 322 at the top of the wealth distribution (Rubin 2019; Stankiewicz 2019). Even a main academic proponent of the Warren proposals concedes that their impact would place them on the wrong side of the Laff er curve (Frank 2019; Saez and Zucman 2019b), that is, a lower tax rate might actually raise more revenue than the rate proposed. Our estimates show that returning top individual income tax and corporate tax rates to their historical peak would generate between $4.2 trillion and $5.5 trillion in a decade, depending on what share of high earners see tax increases. Senator Warren's campaign estimates that the proposed tax changes to be borne by this group will raise $13.2 trillion in a decade, more than twice as much. Th is would represent a tax increase nearly 10 times as large as the Clinton-era reforms and the Obama administration's tax proposals pursued in this vein, which at the time were not successfully legislated. In light of historical experience, it seems unlikely to expect to generate this much revenue from tax increases on the top alone. Th e base-broadening approaches proposed in the next two sections of this chapter meet a stringent test: they make the tax code more effi cient and raise substantial revenue in a very progressive way. But our revenue estimates are less optimistic and involve taxing a broader swath of the population than other approaches that have been advocated. Investing in Compliance to Create a More Progressive Tax System Th e IRS estimates that between 2011 and 2013, it failed to collect more than $380 billion in taxes per year\u2014across all fi ling categories (individual income tax, corporate income tax, self-employment tax, estate tax, and excise tax). 3 Extrapolating this estimate to the present to allow for infl ation and income growth, we fi nd that in 2020 the IRS will fail to collect more than $630 billion, or nearly 15 percent of total tax liabilities. Figure 1 shows that the tax gap will total an estimated $7.5 trillion between 2020 and 2029. (See fi gure 2 for noncompliance rates by fi ling category.) Shrinking the tax gap by 15 percent would generate over $1 trillion in revenue in the next decade. It is hard to imagine a more equitable tax proposal than substantial investment in compliance to make sure that individuals and fi rms pay the taxes they owe. Distortions are also limited because these eff orts will not add new taxes to an already overly complex and sprawling Internal Revenue Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 323 FIGURE 1. Projected Tax Gap in 2020-29 by Filing Category Source: Sarin and Summers 2019b; IRS 2019a. Note: The employment tax gap includes both underpaid employment and self-employment taxes. To compute the tax gap for 2020-29, we rst take the share of the gross tax gap for which the IRS reports each ling category was responsible in 2012. We apply those shares to our estimate of the overall net tax gap for 2020-29. FIGURE 2. Average Noncompliance Rate by Filing Category, 2011-13 Source: Sarin and Summers 2019b; IRS 2019a. Note: The employment tax gap includes both underpaid employment and self-employment taxes. To compute the tax gap for 2020-29, we rst take the share of the gross tax gap for which the IRS reports each ling category was responsible between 2011 and 2013. We apply these shares to our estimate of the overall net tax gap for 2020-29.05101520 Individual and Joe Kupferberg 324 Code. Beyond being effi cient and fair, these investments will also create a more progressive tax system. Consideration of individual income tax fi lers illustrates this point clearly. Tax compliance decreases with wealth, because the categories of income that accrue to the richest Americans are the most opaque and thus least likely to be honestly reported and taxed: Over 80 percent of income that accrues to those who make under $200,000 annually is salary and wage income, subject to both cross-party reporting and withholding requirements, with a resulting compliance rate of 99 percent. Less than 20 percent of the income that accrues to those making $10 million or more is wage income. Th ese high-income individuals are much more likely to report partnership income and rental income, with much higher rates of noncompliance. While elimination of the tax gap is impossible, the magnitude of the gap is a function of the IRS's resources available to pursue and punish noncompliance. Today, these resources are at historic lows, as shown in fi gures 3 and 4. In the last decade, the IRS budget has declined (in real terms) by 15 percent (35 percent if measured as a share of collections reinvested into the IRS). Th is substantial decline is the consequence of a sustained attack on the IRS by special interest groups who benefi t from a lax tax regime. Th e result is large direct revenue losses: as the rate of individual and corporate audits fell by half, additional tax revenue generated by these examinations fell by the same proportion. FIGURE 3.

By focusing these additional resources on collecting owed but unpaid taxes from high-income individuals, such investment would likely shrink the tax gap by around 15 percent (table 4). Our compliance proposals focus on three main areas: increasing examination resources, investing in technology infrastructure, and encouraging more cross-party reporting to verify that income is reported accurately and tax liabilities are appropriately assessed. INCREASE AND BETTER TARGET AUDIT EFFORTS Our proposal involves both increasing the number of examinations\u2014across fi ling categories\u2014and focusing limited resources on audits that are most likely to generate substantial revenue: those of high-wealth individuals. Th e IRS enforcement budget has dropped by a quarter in real terms since the fi nancial crisis, and as a result, the IRS today has fewer auditors than at any point since World War II. Tax enforcement eff orts today are at their lowest level of the last four decades, despite the responsibilities of the IRS and the growing diffi culty of ensuring tax compliance (Rubin 2020).

And the share of millionaires audited has decreased from over 12 percent to around 3 percent. Individual audit rates have dropped for the last eight consecutive years, and the IRS reported that audit rates fell by over 20 percent in fi scal year 2019 alone (Rubin 2020). It is challenging to estimate how signifi cantly this impacts tax collection, but it is telling that, as the share of millionaire audits declined by around 75 percent over this period, the additional taxes collected, following examinations of this group decreased by a similar amount. In related work, we estimate the returns to a substantial investment in IRS resources (Sarin and Summers 2019). Had the IRS been able to conduct audits in 2018 at 2011 rates, it would have conducted nearly 800,000 more i n d i v i d u a l a u d i t s , n e a r l y d o u b l i n g a c t u a l 2 0 1 8 a u d i t r a t e s ; n e a r l y 1 2 , 0 0 0 more corporate audits, increasing audit rates by around 66 percent; 4 m o r e th an 3 ,2 00 m o r e e s t a t e t ax r e turn s , m o r e th an d o u b lin g e s t a t e t ax examinations; and nearly 25,000 more employment tax returns, almost d o u b lin g e m p l o ym e n t a u di ts ( S arin an d S umm e r s 2 0 1 9 ) . Th e increase in revenue from these additional examinations would have totaled nearly $30 billion ($360 billion in a decade).

Tilting audit resources toward the wealthy would be more effi cient in addition to being m o r e p r o g r e s s i v e : A n e x t r a h o u r s p e n t a u d i t i n g a n i n d i v i d u a l fi ler who earns $200,000 annually generates only around $600. An extra hour spent auditing someone who makes $5 million or more a year generates nearly $4,500 ( George 20 1 9 ) . From an effi ciency perspective, it is hard to justify why individuals who receive the Earned Income Tax Credit are as likely to have their fi lings audited as those who make $500,000 or more annually (fi gure 7). Our estimation suggests that by holding audit rates fi xed for individuals who make $200,000 or less annually and instead focusing new enforcement resources on the examination primarily of high-income individual fi lers, corporations, and estate tax fi lers, it would be possible to increase the revenue raised from greater compliance resources to around $715 billion in a decade. Th is amount is perhaps an overestimate because our extrapolation ignores the fact that the average revenue generated from high-income audits is higher than the marginal revenue that would be generated from an additional audit. However , our estimate also ignores the indirect revenue generation that accrues from greater investment in tax compliance deterring errant fi lings, which according to U.S. Treasury estimates can be FIGURE 7.

HOW PROGRESSIVE ARE TAX GAP EFFORTS? Th ese estimates of returns to a progressive increase in examination levels may well be optimistic, and proper scoring by professional scorekeepers is imperative. Several points are worth highlighting. First, to estimate the returns on additional audits of high-income individuals, we rely on IRS data that provide net misreporting percentages for diff erent income types. Wage and salary income is essentially perfectly reported (net misreporting percentage of 1 percent), whereas more opaque categories like capital g a i n s ( n e t m i s r e p o r t i n g p e r c e n t a g e o f 2 3 p e r c e n t ) a n d p r o p r i e t o r s h i p i n c o m e ( n e t m i s r e p o r t i n g p e r c e n t a g e o f 5 5 p e r c e n t ) a r e l e s s l i k e l y t o b e reported properly. We use these averages to calculate net misreporting percentages by income category for individuals at diff erent categories of A G I , b a s e d o n th e ir in c o m e s h ar e s in diff erent categories. Based on this approach, net misreporting rates are more than 5 times as high for those who make $10 million or more annually as they are for those who make under $200,000 (table 5). Th ese estimates suggest that a substantial portion of noncompliance accrues from those who are in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, suggesting that eff orts to curb noncompliance will be borne primarily by top earners and thus these eff orts will be progressive. Our estimates suggest that tax gap reduction eff orts are borne primarily by the wealthy because their income accrues less in wage and salary income a n d m o r e i n o p a q u e c a t e g o r i e s w i t h h i g h m i s r e p o r t i n g p e r c e n t a g e s . TABLE 5. Average Underreporting Percentage by AGI Category AGI category Average share underreporting (percent) Less than $200,000 2.6 $200,000 to $500,000 $1 million 9.1$5 million to $10 million 11.1$10 million or more 13.9 Source: Sarin and Summers 2019b, IRS 2019a, and authors' calculations. Note: For each AGI bracket, the average share underreporting is calculated as the average of misre- porting percentages by income category weighted by the share of income that the income category represents for that AGI bracket.Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 330 However, we fail to account for diff erences in misreporting rates within income type that may diff er by income category. Johns and Slemrod (2010) study the distribution of tax noncompliance based on an audit study of the individual income tax gap performed in 2001. Th ey fi nd that for opaque categories of income\u2014like Schedule C business income, partnership income, and capital gains\u2014noncompliance rates peak between the 90th and 99th percentiles of the income distribution, before falling for the top 1 percent of earners. Th e overall trend they document is that for each income category, misreporting rises with income level, peaking in a high but not the highest income group. Th ere are reasons to be skeptical of this conclusion. First, this audit study was based on 2001 tax returns, and composition of the tax gap has shift ed signifi cantly since then. For one, misreporting rates for capital gains have doubled in this period. It is not obvious how this change in composition impacts the misreporting rates by income level that Johns and Slemrod estimated. Second, it is possible that the audit study methodology is not well tailored to capturing misreporting by the highest income earners, which implies that underreporting at the top is higher than estimated. 5 In prior work, we extrapolate from the overall net misreporting rates in table 5 to estimate that 70 percent of the tax gap accrues to the top 1 percent (Sarin and Summers 2019). Th ose estimates suggest that in 2001 the top 1 percent accounted for nearly 30 percent of the tax gap (expanding to the top 5 percent of earners brings the estimate to 70 percent of the tax gap). Th e Johns and Slemrod approach suggests that the share of the tax gap that accrues to the top 1 percent is around half this, and that 70 percent is a better estimate for the share accruing to the top 5 percent. I t i s i m p o s s i b l e t o k n o w w i t h p r e c i s i o n w h a t t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n o f noncompliance is. However, the suggested reforms focus on increasing the tax compliance of high-income earners by increasing audit rates primarily for millionaires, corporations owned primarily by these individuals, and their estates. As such, the additional income generated from the greater tax enforcement eff orts outlined would likely accrue from the top 1 percent of earners. INVEST IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Beyond examinations, the outdated IRS technology off ers substantial scope for a useful overhaul that will enable the IRS to better detect and address errant returns and will decrease costs of compliance eff o rts su ch as fi eld audits. A few facts illustrate the extent to which the IRS has underinvested in technology: In 2018 the IRS spent only $2.5 billion on new information Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 331 technology investments. Th at number seems large until we compare it to Bank of America's outlays, which were around $16 billion\u2014despite the company serving only 25 percent of American households (Sarin and Summers 2019). One may believe that the IRS does not need substantial new technological investment because it has already developed state-of-the-art technology to address noncompliance. Th e magnitude of the tax gap suggests this is unlikely. Consider the following illustration of the defi ciencies of the IRS's system: 97 percent of individual income tax fi lers receive at least one \"information return\" that contains information that can be used to identify misreported income. However, in 2010 (the last time these data were made available), the IRS identifi ed fi ve times as many mismatches as it was able to successfully resolve. 6 According to the U.S. Government Accountability Offi ce (GAO), the IRS fi le systems date to 1960 and are among the oldest in the federal government (GAO 2018a), and the most recent Taxpayer Advocate report speculates that without an overhaul, there are \"limitations on the functionality of a 60-year-old infrastructure, and at some point, the entire edifi ce is likely to collapse\" ( Offi ce of the T axpayer Advocate 20 1 8, 351). Th e IRS understands the substantial revenue benefi ts of investments in technology and has campaigned for additional resources that have allowed i t t o p il o t p r o grams th a t hin t a t th e be n e fi ts of a technological overhaul. One success story is the return review program, which automates analysis of returns to prevent the issuance of invalid refunds. In 2017, this program saved the IRS $4.4 billion and cost only $90 million (GAO 2018b, U.S. Department of the Treasury 2018b). Greater investment in this and similar eff orts have substantial potential to raise additional tax revenue in a progressive manner. INCREASE INFORMATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Better technology to help address discrepancies through information returns solves only a piece of the puzzle. Many income categories are subject to little or no cross-party reporting, which means there is no way to check the accuracy of these returns against information reported from another source. Unsurprisingly, income subject to little reporting\u2014like proprietorship income and rental income\u2014is also the category of income where compliance rates are lowest: 45 percent at last estimate. Increasing the visibility of more opaque sources of income is likely to raise substantial revenue. Like our other proposals in the compliance arena, this too is a progressive reform, because opaque income accrues primarily to individuals Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 332 at the tail end of the income distribution: less than 4 percent of individuals who make $200,000 or less a year report any rental or royalty income on their tax returns; over 40 percent of those who make $5 million or more annually do. In related work, we estimate that an increase in information reporting could generate $350 billion in additional revenue in a decade (Sarin and Summers 2019). Increasing information reporting is generally regarded as an eff ective way to increase tax compliance. Th e GAO and the IRS suggest that reporting requirements are among the \"few means of sizably increasing the compliance rate\" (Herndon 2019, 3; see also McTigue 2019). Still, there are reasons to be skeptical about the promise of increased information reporting requirements. Th e most recent eff ort on this dimension was an expansion of reporting requirements for landlords and small businesses\u2014requiring them to fi le 1099 forms for all purchases of goods and services over $600 annually. Th is eff ort was quickly repealed because of the burden imposed on small business owners, hinting at the political obstacles to successful reforms on this dimension. Without comprehensive information reporting, there is also signifi c a n t r o o m t o g a m e r e q u i r e m e n t s a n d t ak e a d v a n t a g e of holes in reporting regimes. Beginning in 2011, electronic payments r e c e i v e d b y b us in e s s e s o p e r a tin g as s o l e p r o p ri e t o r s hi p s ( e . g . , c r e di t car d payments) were reported to the IRS and businesses on forms processing these payments, via Form 1099-K. Th is increase in information reporting made taxpayers more likely to fi le business income returns, and reported receipts rose by up to 24 percent (Slemrod et al. 2017). However, taxes paid did not increase by a similar magnitude, because taxpayers largely off set t h e i n c r e a s e d r e c e i p t s w i t h a n i n c r e a s e i n r e p o r t e d e x p e n s e s , w i t h n o corresponding information reporting requirements. Th is experience gives guidance on the appropriate design for information reporting requirements: excluding certain categories of income from information reporting will encourage income to shift into these excluded categories when reporting r e q ui r e m e n t s r i s e . I t will b e im p o rt an t t o an ti c i p a t e g am i n g p o s s i b il i ti e s and increase information reporting across categories of income. Other Progressive Tax Reforms More can be done to rein in illegal tax evasion by the wealthy and the fi rms they control. But there is also a compelling case to be made to restrict the legal maneuvers that fortunate individuals, with the help of skilled tax advisors, avail themselves of to lower tax liabilities. As one of us has written elsewhere, \"With respect to taxation, as so much else in life, the real scandal is not the illegal things people do\u2014it is the things that are legal\" (Summers Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 333 2014). Here, we make the case for some base-broadening and effi ciency- enhancing reforms that will decrease opportunities for legal tax avoidance. CLOSING CORPORATE TAX SHELTERS Firms shift revenues to countries with lower tax rates to avoid corporate tax liability. Economist Kimberly Clausing (2016) estimates that the cost to the United States from corporate tax base erosion is more than $100 billion annually. Beyond revenue consequences here in the United States, the ability of fi rms to erode tax liability in this manner creates a destructive race to the bottom, as jurisdictions strive to attract large and mobile multinational fi rms by off ering them the most attractive tax treatment. Corporate tax base erosion also adds to the regressivity of the tax system since empirical evidence suggests that corporate taxes accrue primarily to shareholders and not workers: the Joint Committee on Taxation and the U.S. Treasury estimate that 75 to 82 percent of the burden of the corporate tax falls on owners of capital (Cronin et al. 2013; Joint Committee on Taxation 2013). A major tenet of the TCJA was its eff ort to reduce the incentives for and ability to engage in costly profi t-shift ing. As such, the legislation imposes a minimum tax on \"global intangible low-taxed income\" of foreign corporations. Th e basic idea is that foreign earnings are subject to a minimum tax rate of 10.5 percent (which will rise to 13.125 percent by 2025). Firms are provided tax credits for their foreign tax liabilities, but importantly, these credits accrue on a global (rather than per-country) basis. Paradoxically, the new regime incentivizes fi rms to locate investment in jurisdictions with both higher and lower corporate tax rates than the United States, because income can be blended from both groups of countries to decrease domestic tax liability. Th e result is an \"America last\" corporate tax regime. Incremental changes can have a large impact: for example, transitioning to a regime where credits for corporations with investments abroad accrue on a per-country rather than a global basis will raise tax revenues by nearly $170 billion in a decade. But more must be done. Needed reforms include more robust international cooperation to deter profi t-shift ing incentives, harsher penalties for fi rms and tax advisors who facilitate dubious sheltering, and penalties on tax havens. Th ese reforms would have the dual benefi t of encouraging the location of economic activity in the United States and discouraging the use of vast intellectual resources to design clever tax avoidance strategies. Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 334 CLOSING INDIVIDUAL TAX SHELTERS Individuals avail themselves of a number of legal tricks to lower individual tax liabilities. Many of these moves relate to the use of corporations and partnerships as shields to lower individual tax liability. Tax gaming opportunities based on using a corporation as a tax shelter are straightforward to understand: Since top individual tax rates are high (exceeding 40 percent in some cases), it pays to recharacterize one's income. Th e TCJA's changes increased the incentives for gaming on this margin by lowering corporate rates substantially and increasing the incentives to characterize income as earned through ownership of a corporation, rather than accruing to an individual employee. Although earning income through a corporation imposes a cost in the form of a \"double tax\" when t h a t i n c o m e i s d i s t r i b u t e d , i n d i v i d u a l s c a n s h i e l d i n c o m e f r o m d o u b l e taxation in a number of ways, such as by retaining the interest until death; holding corporate shares in retirement accounts that are tax-advantaged; or making use of loopholes that enable corporate distributions without tax, like Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, which excludes from taxation the gains from small business stock (Kamin et al. 2018). In a world where the IRS's ability to enforce tax compliance has been diluted by budget cuts and the incentives to game these margins have increased with the decrease in the corporate tax rate, many of these loopholes, which have long been available to taxpayers, are increasingly attractive following the 2017 TCJA. Individuals may also choose to organize their small businesses as S corporations for tax benefi t. Most American workers have wages deducted to cover the cost of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. However, payroll taxes apply only to income derived from wage labor, not to business profi ts, so small business owners and professionals who form S corporations can avoid payroll taxes by characterizing income as business profi ts rather than wage income (Hanlon 2012). 7 Th e Obama administration estimated that the gains from eliminating the payroll tax loophole alone would be around $300 billion over a decade (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2016). REFORMING CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION Reforms to capital gains taxation have received substantial academic and political attention. Th e central issue identifi ed by reformers is that the current tax regime is ill equipped to collect revenue from the very wealthy, who earn and report income diff erently from the rest of the population. Wages and salaries constitute less than 10 percent of the income of the top 0.001 percent, while capital gains and dividends taxed at preferential rates Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 335 m a k e u p 7 1 p e r c e n t , w i t h b u s i n e s s i n c o m e ( o ft underreported and thus undertaxed) accounting for the remainder (Batchelder and Kamin 2019). Capital gains are taxed at preferential rates, lower than ordinary income levels. Oft en, capital gains escape taxation altogether. For example, gains passed to an heir receive a \"step-up\" in basis and are thus untaxed. Additionally, when capital gains are donated to charity, the gains are untaxed and the donor receives an income tax deduction for the fully appreciated value of the asset. We propose an overhaul of capital gains taxation. In our system, the death of the owner of a capital asset will be a realization event for tax purposes. Th us, the rationale for mark-to-market accrual of capital gains is substantially decreased, because the government will eventually be able to collect tax revenue on all gains. Although in many instances tax collection will not occur until death, in a world where long-term interest rates are currently near zero, the present value of annual tax collection and that of an end-of-life tax are comparable. Further, our proposal is administratively much less cumbersome, requires valuation only once in life, and does not require the IRS to deal with complexities around periods of capital losses. Our proposal has fi ve components. Taxing Capital Gains at Ordinary Income Levels Raising rates on capital gains and dividends to the same level as ordinary income would end the tax advantage that accrues to fi nancial relative to labor income. But without more comprehensive changes (outlined later in this chapter), this approach is unlikely to reach its full revenue potential. Th e Joint Committee on Taxation and the U.S. Treasury assume that the capital gains rate that maximizes revenue is around 30 percent, because of the \"lock-in\" eff ect (Batchelder and Kamin 2019). Th is is because increasing the tax rate on capital gains would infl uence investment decisions and encourage people to defer the sale of capital assets until death, when they can be passed tax-free to heirs. Th e CBO (2018) estimates that raising capital gains rates by 2 percentage points would generate $70 billion in additional revenue in a decade, and thus it follows that raising capital gains rates such that the top tax bracket is taxed at the \"revenue-maximizing\" level would generate an additional $350 billion in revenue over a decade. But as part of a more comprehensive reform package, the revenue potential of higher rates for capital gains increases substantially. Th e Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that the revenue-maximizing capital gains Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 336 rate rises to 50 percent if the stepped-up basis is repealed (Rubin 2019). For those in the top ordinary income tax bracket, taxing capital gains at o r din ary in c o m e l ev e l s w o ul d in c r e as e th e curr e n t r a t e b y 1 7 p e r c e n tag e points; na\u00efve extrapolation from the CBO estimate suggests that this would raise nearly $600 billion in a decade. Eliminating Stepped-Up Basis for Capital Gains Wealth tax advocates are right to point out that the current tax regime facilitates growing wealth inequality. Th is is because our tax laws allow substantial wealth to be passed down across generations without taxes ever being collected. To understand how this happens in practice, consider an entrepreneur who starts a highly successful company. She pays herself a small salary, and the company does not pay dividends, so it can invest in growth. Her tax liability is thus very low, despite her becoming substantially wealthy, as she does not pay taxes on the growing value of her ownership stake. Th ese unrealized capital gains are only taxed upon a realization event, like their sale. However, no capital gains tax is ever collected on appreciation of capital assets if th ey ar e passed d o wn t o h eirs. Wh en th e en tr ep r en eur di es an d leaves the stock of her company to her benefi ciary, the cost basis is \"stepped up\" so that the gain in value during the entrepreneur's life is never taxed. Th e benefi ciaries of stepped-up basis are the wealthy: nearly 40 percent of the wealth of the top 1 percent is in the form of accrued but unrealized capital gains, and the top 1 percent holds around half of all such unrealized gains (Batchelder and Kamin 2019). In addition to decreasing government revenue, stepped-up basis is distortionary since it creates an incentive to hold on to underperforming assets purely for tax reasons, or to fail to sell these assets to be used in more productive ways while one is alive\u2014because doing so would constitute a realization event. Eliminating stepped-up basis would thus improve the productivity of the economy and be desirable even if it did not raise any revenue. However, the revenue benefi ts turn out to be substantial: implementing the Obama administration's proposals for constructive realization of capital gains at death would raise nearly $250 billion in a decade, and 99 percent of this revenue would be collected from the top 1 percent of fi lers (White House 2015). Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 337 Eliminating the Carried Interest Loophole Similarly, many wealthy individuals shelter income from taxation by taking advantage of the lower tax rates for partners of investment fi rms. Because income that fl ows through partnerships is oft en treated as capital gains and taxed at lower rates, private equity and hedge fund managers have an incentive to minimize the share of their compensation that is ordinary income and to maximize payouts received in the form of \"carried interest.\" Th e Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that taxing carried profi ts as ordinary income would generate $20 billion in a decade (Joint Committee on Taxation 2016). Eliminating Like-Kind Exchanges A Section 1031 like-kind exchange allows for the disposal of investment property and the purchase of a replacement, without tax liability generated from the sale of the asset. Th e initial objective of like-kind exchanges w a s t o e x e m p t f r o m t a x a t i o n s m a l l - s c a l e t r a n s a c t i o n s ( e . g . , l i v e s t o c k purchases by farmers), but today, like-kind exchanges help the wealthy avoid taxation on signifi c a n t c o m m e r c i a l r e a l e s t a t e p u r c h a s e s , a m o n g other large transactions (Marr 2016). Wealthy investors can combine the tax exemption for like-kind exchanges with stepped-up basis at death to make highly profi table investments that avoid tax liability entirely. Like- kind exchanges average at least 6 percent of all commercial real estate sales based on dollar volume, which rises to 10-20 percent in high-tax jurisdictions (Ling and Petrova 2015). Th e Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed the repeal of like-kind exchanges, which at the time were ranked by the Joint Committee on Taxation as the second-largest tax expenditure (Joint Committee on Taxation 2015), and estimated that this would raise $40.9 billion between 2014 and 2023, which, adjusted for growth and infl ation, translates to around $50 billion today (Joint Committee on Taxation 2014). Outright elimination of like-kind exchanges would raise fi ve times as much as the Obama administration's more limited proposal to limit real estate and personal property exchanges to $1 million annual gain deferral and to exclude art and collectibles exchanges. Under the TCJA, Section 1031 now applies only to exchanges of real property and not to exchanges of personal or intangible property ( e.g., machinery , equipment, vehicles, artwork, patents, and other intellectual property). We propose the repeal of Section 1031 entirely, which may generate less revenue than previously estimated due to the TCJA's scaling back of this tax expenditure. It will be important to consider the behavioral eff ects of repeal in the context of the broader program around capital gains we propose and factor this analysis into offi cial revenue scores. Th e Joint Committee on Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 338 Taxation's estimate of tax revenue loss from like-kind exchanges is only 9 percent of its corresponding tax expenditure estimate because it factors in such behavioral responses\u2014specifi cally, that in the absence of like-kind exchanges, taxpayers would delay transactions, which would substantially diminish the potential revenue gains from repeal (Ling and Petrova 2015). Th is lock-in eff ect is muted by our broader set of reforms. End Tax Advantages for Charitable Giving of Long-Term Appreciated Assets Th e tax code incentivizes charitable giving through the donation of long- term appreciated assets. Th i s i s b e c a u s e w h e n a n i n d i v i d u a l d o n a t e s a n asset\u2014like a share of stock\u2014that has appreciated in value, capital gains on that asset generally go untaxed and the individual receives a credit equivalent to the full value of the share, despite not paying any tax on the gains. 8 F r o m t h e t a x p a y e r ' s p e r s p e c t i v e , t h i s a p p r o a c h i s p r e f e r a b l e to selling the asset (and paying capital gains) and making a monetary chari tab l e d o na ti o n, wi th a s mall e r ded u cti o n. I t is also p r ef e rab l e t o th e charity, which receives the entire asset\u2014rather than the cash that remains aft er paying capital gains taxes. To understand the diff erences between these approaches for the individual and for the charity, consider a taxpayer in the top tax bracket who plans to make a $10,000 donation to charity (table 6). Th is taxpayer has a 40 percent combined federal and state income tax rate and a combined 20 percent tax rate on capital gains. Th e stock has a cost basis of $2,000. We propose eliminating individuals' ability to use charity to escape capital gains liability. Practically, this means constructive realization of TABLE 6.

Note: Calculations assume a $10,000 donation of an asset with a $2,000 cost basis, which is either donated as stock or as cash. Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 339 capital gains when individuals give to charity. Th i s w i l l m e a n t h a t t h a t tax preferences for charitable gains will be equivalent whether individuals choose to donate assets or the cash that is generated from the sale of those assets. To our knowledge, the CBO has not scored this proposal directly, but it estimates the revenue gains from eliminating deductions for noncash charitable contributions at around $150 billion over a decade (CBO 2018). F r o m b o th a b e h a vi o ral an d s c o rin g p e r s p e cti v e, i t will b e im p e ra ti v e t o think about the interaction between the tenets of the proposed program, rather than to evaluate its components in isolation. Our na\u00efve revenue estimation fails to account for the interaction eff ects of the various prongs of our proposal, but they are likely to be important. For example, taxing capital gains at ordinary income levels will have a lock-in eff ect that discourages the realization of capital gains. Th is lowers the revenue that the CBO estimates will be raised by the change. But the CBO estimate is independent of simultaneous changes to the tax code: combining an increase in capital gains tax rates with constructive realization of capital gains at death disincentivizes lock-in because taxes will eventually have to be paid on appreciated capital gains. Our elimination of the use of charitable giving to avoid taxes on capital gains further strengthens this eff ect. Overall, we believe we have designed a program that eliminates the incentive to lock in capital gains because it eliminates loopholes to avoid eventual taxation on these assets. Th i s c h a n g e s h o u l d m i t i g a t e c o n c e r n s about illiquidity and distortions that arise from under-realization of capital gains. It also makes a program of mark-to-market capital gains taxation less attractive, especially given the administrative complexity. In today's world, with long-term interest rates near zero, there is little reason to insist on immediate realization of capital gains if we create a system requiring taxes eventually to be paid on these gains. CAPPING TAX DEDUCTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS FOR THE WEALTHY A homeowner in the top tax bracket who makes a $1,000 mortgage payment saves $370 in taxes (37 percent top-rate deduction). Under an Obama administration proposal to cap these deductions at 28 percent a cr o ss earn e r s, this sam e wri t e -o ff would save this wealthy taxpayer just $280. Importantly, this change would raise tax burdens only for the rich who benefi t from a deduction at top-rate levels. Th e change would apply t o i t e m i z e d d e d u c t i o n s s u c h a s m o rt g a g e i n t e r e s t , c h a r i t a b l e g i vi n g , an d medical expenses. Th ose with marginal rates under the cap would still be able to claim the full value of their itemized deductions, making this reform progressive. Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 340 Our proposal would also apply to certain types of income currently exempt from any tax liability, such as municipal bond interest, workplace health insurance, and retirement savings contributions, as proposed in the fi scal year 2017 Obama budget (U.S. Department of the Treasury 2016).9 Th e TCJA decreased the deductibility of home mortgages, such as by allowing homeowners to claim a deduction for the interest on up to only $750,000 of mortgage debt (previously, the limit was $1 million) and by capping the deductibility of state and local real property taxes at $10,000. Despite these changes, the Obama-era proposal to cap itemized deductions would still generate signifi cant additional tax revenues, though exactly how much can be raised is unclear. At the time it was proposed, it was estimated to raise nearly $650 billion in a decade (Sperling and Furman 2012). In earlier work, we speculate that following the TCJA, additional cuts in this vein are likely to raise $250 billion in a decade (Sarin and Summers 2019). ENDING THE 20 PERCENT PASS-THROUGH DEDUCTION Arguably the most distortionary of the changes brought about by the TCJA is the newly introduced 20 percent deduction for qualifi ed business income. Th is deduction exacerbates the already signifi cant problems that arise from a tax system that preferences noncorporate business income over individual earnings. I t i s h a r d t o i d e n t i f y a n y d e f e n s i b l e p o l i c y r a t i o n a l e f o r t h i s d e d u c t i o n . Perhaps it was a misguided attempt to decrease the incentives to shift business income into corporate structures following the decrease of the corporate rate to 21 percent (Kamin et al. 2018). But the structure of the deduction creates a complex framework with innumerable gaming opportunities. For example, certain lines of business are ineligible for the deduction, including professionals in health, law, athletics, and any trade or business in which the principal asset is the reputation or skill of owners or employees. Th ere is no rationale for why some categories of income are favored with a tax break and others disfavored\u2014indeed, some categories of professionals, such as architects and engineers, shift ed categories as the conference bill evolved. Th e most obvious gaming opportunity that this deduction enables is for individuals in preferred service industries who can be recharacterized from employees (ineligible for the deduction) to nonemployees (who benefi t from it). Even those who are employed in exempt categories, like legal professionals, can benefi t from the deduction by \"cracking\" income streams to take advantage of the tax break, for example by forming separate fi rms to hold their real assets in real estate investment trusts (REITs) eligible for Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 341 the deduction; or by \"packing\" income into qualifi ed service categories, as described by Kamin et al. (2018). Estimates suggest that this provision will reduce federal revenues by $ 4 3 0 b illi o n in th e n e xt d e c a d e ( J o in t C o mm i tt e e o n T ax a ti o n 2 0 1 7 ) . I t s elimination from the Internal Revenue Code will raise revenue primarily from taxpayers making more than $1 million annually and eliminate the wasteful intellectual energy spent on trying to qualify for this deduction. LOWERING THE ESTATE TAX THRESHOLD Before the TCJA, only 5,000 Americans were liable for estate taxation. Th e recent changes more than halved that small share by doubling the estate tax exemption to $22.4 million per couple. Th e Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this change costs $83 billion (2017), with the benefi ts accruing entirely to 3,200 of the wealthiest American households. Repealing these changes and applying estate taxes even more broadly than before\u2014for example, as the Obama administration proposed, by lowering the threshold to $7 million for couples\u2014would raise around $320 billion in a decade, while still imposing estate tax liability on only 0.3 percent of decedents. In addition to broadening the estate tax base, there is also signifi cant room to attack the many loopholes that enable the well-advised ultra-rich to avoid estate taxation. Th e current estate tax rate is 40 percent; however, the eff ective estate tax rate (total tax collections as a share of the gross taxable estate ) is less than 1 0 percent. Even aft er adjusting for the fact that many estates are nontaxable, since they are bequests to surviving spouses, the eff ective estate tax rate remains only around 20 percent, about half of the actual estate tax rate. Th is is because a great deal of wealth escapes estate taxation, such as through the establishment of trusts that enable division o f a s s e t s a m o n g f a m i l y m e m b e r s , p l a n n i n g d e v i c e s t h a t g i v e i n c o m e t o charity while keeping the remainder for heirs, and other complex estate tax avoidance devices known to sophisticated tax advisors. We support proposals that limit these loopholes and curb opportunities for estate tax planning. One approach with substantial merit is Lily Batchelder's proposal to transition from an estate tax to an inheritance tax, imposing tax liability on the heirs who profi t from inherited wealth, rather than the estate that provides it. Th is approach would have the benefi t of rewarding estates that disburse wealth broadly, attacking wealth concentration directly. It is also likely to be more effi cient than more progressive income taxation or wealth taxation because the available empirical evidence suggests that the wealthy , when making work and saving decisions, do not place as high a Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 342 value on the inheritance of their heirs as they do on taxes that impact them or their estates directly (Batchelder 2020). INCREASING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 25 PERCENT When corporations began lobbying for corporate tax reform, their stated object was a 25 percent tax rate. Th e TCJA delivered more than the business community asked, slashing the corporate rate to 21 percent. Th e CBO estimates that a 1 percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate would generate $100 billion in the next decade (2018), so a 4 percentage point increase to 25 percent could generate an additional $400 billion in revenue. Raising the corporate tax rate would not increase the tax burden on most new investment, because it would raise in equal measure the valuation o f t h e d e p r e c i a t i o n d e d u c t i o n s t h a t c o r p o r a t i o n s c a n t a k e w h e n t h e y undertake investments. Th is increase would primarily burden those earning excess rents from monopoly-like profi ts and those who have received enormous windfalls from the TCJA. Th is increase would be administratively straightforward given that the corporate tax infrastructure is well established. As discussed, since the costs of corporate taxation fall overwhelmingly on owners of capital rather than workers, increasing the corporate tax rate would also be very progressive. A higher corporate tax rate would also mitigate, at least somewhat, the incentives created by the T C J A t o r e c l a s s i f y l a b o r i n c o m e a s c o r p o r a t e i n c o m e t o m i n i m i z e t a x liability. MINIMUM TAX ON BOOK INCOME In 20 1 8 ar o un d 1 ,200 U .S. co m pani es r epo rted n et in co m e o f m o r e than $ 1 0 0 m i l l i o n . O f t h e s e , n e a r l y 2 5 p e r c e n t p a i d z e r o o r n e g a t i v e f e d e r a l income taxes (authors' calculations using Standard & Poor's Compustat Services 2018). A minimum tax on book income would help ameliorate the regular failure to levy taxes on profi table fi rms. A minimum tax is preferable to an additional tax on book income\u2014as has been proposed in the 2020 election cycle\u2014because it does not create distortions from double taxation of fi rms that already bear substantial tax liabilities. We estimate that a minimum tax of 10 percent on book income would raise nearly $800 billion in a decade. However, it is important to adjust this total to account for taxes paid by large multinational corporations in foreign jurisdictions. Further, tax liabilities must be adjusted to allow for carryforwards, so that companies with variable tax liabilities are not treated unfairly. Th ese adjustments decrease the revenue-raising potential of a 10 percent minimum tax to slightly over $200 billion over a decade. Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 343 Importantly, these estimates are based on the number of fi rms liable for a minimum tax on book income in 2018; these are fi rms that, in this scenario aft er the passage of the TCJA, would be eligible for this tax because their total federal and foreign tax liabilities do not reach the 10 percent minimum threshold. We also propose increasing the corporate tax rate from the current 21 percent rate to 25 percent. Th is scaling back of the TCJA will mechanically decrease the number of fi rms paying a minimum tax on book income and thus will have the potential to raise revenue. Some Issues with Newer Alternatives Th e measures that we propose in this chapter meet a stringent test. Th ey are reforms that would be desirable even if the government did not have pressing revenue needs. Th ey are progressive and reduce the ability of those at the top to make use of special breaks that have advantaged them at the expense of American taxpayers for too long. It is useful to compare the approaches we advocate\u2014increased investment in tax compliance as well as base-broadening reforms\u2014to alternatives in the current tax reform debate, such as wealth taxation and accrual taxation of capital gains. From both an economic and a political economy perspective, we believe the approaches we describe are superior. Economists tend to favor base-broadening tax reform. Th is is because broadening the tax base is more effi cient than increasing tax rates. Th e logic is simple: increasing tax rates encourages ineffi cient behavior to avoid higher tax liability. In contrast, broadening the tax base decreases such ineffi cient behavior; for example, eliminating loopholes like the pass- through deduction decreases eff ort by individuals and the tax planners they employ to recharacterize income to exempt it from tax liability . Th is suggests that even if we decide that the government's revenue needs require substantial increases in top tax rates, such approaches should be pursued only aft er the revenue potential of base-broadeners is exhausted. Th e q u e s t i o n o f w h a t b a s e s h o u l d b e u s e d t o e v a l u a t e t a x p r o g r e s s i v i t y requires further consideration. Conceptually, lifetime expenditure would be the ideal base, but traditionally economists have evaluated how progressive the tax code is with respect to individual income. Many believe that the concentration of wealth has risen faster than the concentration of income in the United States in recent decades. Th is line of study is complicated by the fact that the defi nition of wealth and measures of its concentration are far from obvious (Smith, Zidar, and Zwick 2019; Weil 2015). To make the case that measurement of progressivity should be based on wealth shares Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 344 rather than income shares requires confi dence that wealth can be measured properly and a belief that wealth somehow confers benefi ts even if it is not spent. Th is case has yet to be made. From an administrability standpoint, we are skeptical of wealth taxation and mark-to-market proposals. Recent estimates speculate that wealth tax proposals could generate nearly $4 trillion in a decade and that mark-to-market accrual of capital gains could raise around $2 trillion (Batchelder and Kamin 2019; Saez and Zucman 2019a). We believe these estimates are substantially overstated because both approaches raise practical questions\u2014largely ignored by na\u00efve revenue estimation\u2014that any implemented policy will have to grapple with. One issue for wealth taxation involves valuation: how will ownership stakes in private fi rms without market valuations be ascertained, for example? Wealth taxation is also complicated by the illiquidity of the assets held by the ultra-wealthy. An entrepreneur who has built a successful start-up may be liable for a wealth tax but unable to pay it since she cannot sell shares or borrow against the value of her own shares of the fi rm. Wealth tax advocates believe they have come to a \"clean solution\" around questions about liquidity that plagued wealth taxation in European countries by raising the exemption threshold so that fewer households are liable for the tax (Saez and Zucman 2019a). But given that the available empirical evidence shows that portfolio shares of the 0.1 percent are most heavily tilted toward illiquid asset classes, it is hard to see how this qualifi es as a solution (Smith, Zidar, and Zwick 2019). Other issues around implementation include, for example, the fact that a given wealth exemption will encourage distortionary bunching to avoid wealth tax liability. In earlier work, we make the point that on an optimistic read, the estate tax\u2014a form of wealth tax that already exists in the United States\u2014generates only 40 percent of the estimated revenue predicted by wealth tax advocates (Summers and Sarin 2019). Th is diff erence is attributable to estate tax avoidance strategies such as the use of trusts, tax-advantaged borrowing schemes, charitable contributions, valuation discounts, and the like. Furthermore, the wealth tax base is overstated, likely by a factor of two (Smith, Zidar, and Zwick 2019). In our view a more realistic estimate of the wealth tax's revenue potential is around half of the estimated $3.75 trillion over a decade. Th us, beyond its effi ciency virtues, the approach we outline is likely to raise substantially more revenue than this alternative strategy. Similarly, mark-to-market taxation of capital gains is administratively cumbersome and likely to raise less revenue than has been estimated. S h o u l d m a r k - t o - m a r k e t t a x a t i o n b e a p p l i e d t o b o t h p u b l i c l y t r a d e d a n d Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 345 private assets, then\u2014as with wealth taxation\u2014the valuation diffi culties will pose an awesome challenge to the IRS each year. If, instead, taxation on private assets is deferred, then the tax code will contribute to the already increasing trend of fi rms to stay private for longer to avoid tax liability. Additional questions concern how current unrealized gains and losses will be treated in a mark-to-market regime. If mark-to-market applies only to gains and losses arising aft er the eff ective date, the result will be a hybrid system that exacerbates lock-in concerns by disincentivizing individuals from realizing gains and losses, lest these transactions trigger annual tax liability in the new mark-to-market regime. A s wi th a s y s t e m o f w e al th t ax e s , im p l e m e n t a ti o n i s s u e s al s o ari s e fr o m the mark-to-market threshold. Some have suggested that mark-to-market losses can be used to decrease future capital gains taxes (Leiserson and McGrew 2019). But what happens if losses are so large that individuals are no longer eligible for the mark-to-market regime? On grounds of economic effi ciency and administrability, we believe that an approach encompassing base broadening along with restoration of tax rates, like the one laid out in this chapter, dominates approaches based on new tax concepts like wealth taxation or mark-to-market capital gains taxation, or approaches that focus predominantly on increases in tax rates. It is capable of raising substantial sums, probably as much as is politically feasible from those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution. Additionally , an approach like the one we have outlined is more likely to be implemented successfully than riskier, untested alternatives that are vulnerable to political attacks, legislative impasse, and legal challenges. For example, even if a wealth tax could be passed, it faces a large risk of being found unconstitutional by the current Supreme Court (Hemel and Kysar 2019). Finally, there are important issues of fairness and equity that suggest base- broadening measures are preferable to alternative approaches. We suspect most Americans would regard tax reform that halved the wealth of the nation's 800 billionaires as being manifestly unfair and setting a worrisome precedent, both for those with less wealth and for those who might be successful in the future. Yet over 10 years, a 6 percent wealth tax does exactly that, even aside from the impact of current income and property taxes. Th e fact that this taking occurs over a decade rather than all at once does not strike us as all tha t m eanin gful a distin cti o n. Am e ri can expe ri e n ce d oes not provide a basis for judging the impact of such measures on incentives. Further, political theorists have long felt that government expenditures that most of the population is involved in paying for are more rigorously Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 346 scrutinized and better managed than those in which most citizens have no contributory role. An important consideration is the broad question of whether the correct strategy for addressing inequality is to rely on tax strategies that soak the rich. More egalitarian societies than the United States, such as Sweden and Canada, maintain highly preferential taxation of capital gains and do not tax wealth or estates at all. Instead they pursue the objective of reducing inequality by using broad-based taxation methods, such as the value-added tax, which are borne by all citizens to fi nance universal entitlements and transfers to the poor. To some extent our base-broadening tax reform strategy can be criticized along these same lines. But it can be justifi ed on economic effi ciency grounds, and it is much less likely to crowd out more universal taxes than a focus on new levies only on those with high income. Ultimately, those concerned with inequality need to decide whether their greater concern is taking down the rich or raising up the middle class. We believe that a base-broadening strategy is much more conducive to the latter approach. A n o b j e c t i o n t o t h e s t r a t e gy w e p r o p o s e i s t h a t m a n y o f o u r i d e a s , l i k e taxing capital gains at death or limiting deductions, have been around for a long time and have never been enacted. Some argue that perhaps new, more unitary ideas like wealth taxation have a greater chance of enactment. We fi nd the leapfrog idea that big transformative changes are easier to enact than incremental measures highly implausible. Our reading of American political history is that big, immediate transformation eff orts like the Clinton 1993 health plan are rarely if ever successful. Th e success stories like Social Security and Medicare or even the introduction of the income tax all involved long implementation periods and much discussion. Th e fact that aft er a half century of discussion the deduction of state and local taxes was repealed in the 2017 tax reform eff ort illustrates that long-considered proposals can go from unacceptable to acceptable surprisingly quickly. Questions and Concerns 1. What role should horizontal equity play in determining tax policies? Th e principle of horizontal equity suggests that similarly situated individuals should be taxed equivalently. A wealth tax does not achieve this objective. Individuals above the wealth tax threshold will be taxed twice on the same returns: fi rst as income and second as wealth. Th ose Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 347 with equivalent income streams, but who are right below the wealth tax t h r e s h o l d , w i l l p a y o n l y i n c o m e t a x e s . Th is is both unfair and creates signifi cant gaming incentives. Further, even among those who face wealth tax liability, their illiquid assets will be taxed based on potentially arbitrary and likely inconsistent appraisals of their value. Increasing compliance and base-broadening approaches, in contrast, will help ensure that all individuals with the same level of income, regardless of how it is accrued, face the same tax burden. 2. How would you sequence your reforms? We propose a range of policies from overhauling capital gains taxation, to increases in corporate tax liabilities, to much greater investment in the IRS' enforcement eff orts. Since it is unlikely that such a wide range of changes can be implemented immediately, it is helpful to think through what reformers should prioritize fi rst. We believe that substantial investment in tax compliance is the appropriate place to start. Th is is p ra cti cal , b e ca us e i t will tak e l ar g e o u tl a ys o f b o th fi nancial resources and time for the IRS to build up a workforce that is well-suited to the substantial increase in auditing and new data-driven enforcement eff o r t s t h a t w e r e c o m m e n d . I t i s a l s o s e n s i b l e b e c a u s e a t least some aspects of our compliance agenda can be implemented without new legislation: better targeting current IRS resources toward policing the returns of high-income earners and matching individual returns to existing information reports are examples of changes that can be implemented immediately. Finally, compliance investment has the fewest economic risks\u2014it increases revenue without introducing any potentially distortionary changes to the tax code and is guaranteed to make the taxation more effi cient, by decreasing the incentives for wasteful expenditure to dodge tax liability. Conclusion Growing federal spending needs require that the government fi nd ways to raise additional revenue. Given the growth in inequality, progressive tax reform is and should be high on progressives' tax agenda. Our belief is that the way forward involves changes to the tax code that increase compliance, close loopholes, and broaden the tax base. On grounds of economic effi ciency and administrability, we believe such an approach dominates new tax concepts like wealth taxation or mark-to-market capital gains taxation. Natasha Sarin, Lawrence Summers, and Joe Kupferberg 348 Th e program that we lay out is capable of raising substantial sums: around $4 trillion over the course of a decade. As a share of GDP, this total is more than was raised by any tax increase in the last half century, and we believe it represents as much as is politically feasible to raise from increasing taxes on those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution. Th e challenges facing the United States today may mean that this base- broadening approach will not raise as much revenue as is needed, but it is clearly the place to start. Measures to increase tax compliance and decrease the ability of the wealthy and large corporations to take advantage of preferential tax loopholes comport with basic notions of fairness, and creating a more effi cient tax system will increase the revenue potential of future reforms. Acknowledgments We are grateful to the attendees of Th e Hamilton Project author's conference for thoughtful feedback on an earlier version of this proposal. We also thank Jason Furman, Charles Ros sotti, and Les Samuels for helpful discussions. Endnotes 1. Th is is a lower bound, since we calculate the total tax liability of the wealthy using the deductions that they claim for taxes paid. 2. Th e Auten and Splinter (2019) income concept is broader than our focus on adjusted gross income. Th e authors add to adjusted gross income sources th at are not captured on individual returns, including corporate retained earnings, corporate taxes, business property taxes, retirement account income, and other sources. 3. Th e compliance proposals referenced in this section are detailed at much greater length in Sarin and Summers (2019). Th e data presented and much of the discussion follow directly from our past work. 4. Note that this estimate is based on the rate of corporate audits, which decreased from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 0.9 percent in 2019. Th is does not correspond to the total dollars of corporate income that are audited\u2014which is a subs tantially higher percentage. Th is is because audit rates for large companies are much higher than the audit rates by number of corporations. One way to see this diff erence is by looking at the share of large corporations ($20 billion or more in assets) that were audited in 2018\u201449.3 percent. Th is is much higher than the general corporate audit rate of 1.5 percent. But the decline relati ve to the 2011 peak remains signifi cant: in 2011, 95.6 percent of large corporations were audited. 5. One of the problems with the audit study appr oach is that the wealthy accrue income that is unobservable on their individual tax fi lings. Cooper et al. (2016) are unable to ascribe 30 percent of partnership income to individual fi lers, which they interpret as evidence that the tax code encourages fi rms to organize in opaque partnership forms to lower tax liability. 6. A 2015 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report suggests a similarly low share, reporting that the Automated Underreporter Program that matches individual and information returns routinely identifi es more than 20 million individual t ax returns with discrepancies annually and typically reviews around 20 percent of the discrepancies it identifi es (Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration 2015). Tax Reform for Progressivity: A Pragmatic Approach 349 7. In 2013, the last time the data were made available, the IRS estimated that nearly 70 percent of S corporations are noncompliant with tax rules and that the majority of these cases involved underreported income (GAO 2009). Th is loophole closure would increase the tax burden on high- paid professionals and small business owners who currently avoid payroll tax liability. S corporations are not large: only 0.12 percent have assets greater than $100 million (IRS 2015). Further, because the Social Security payroll tax is capped at a maximum of employee's wages ($132,900 in calendar year 2019), the gains from this avoidance strategy are limited. However, Medicare taxes are not capped, and the 3.8 percent tax on self-employment earnings for high-income taxpayers can be avoided by using the S corporation structure. 8.

We believe that today's increasingly competitive global economy demands public policy ideas commensurate with the challenges of the 21 st Century. The Project's economic strategy refl ects a judgment that long-term prosperity is best achieved by fostering economic growth and broad participation in that growth, by enhancing individual economic security, and by embracing a role for effective government in making needed public investments. Our strategy calls for combining public investment, a secure social safety net, and fi scal discipline. In that framework, the Project puts forward innovative proposals from leading economic thinkers \u2014 based on credible evidence and experience, not ideology or doctrine \u2014 to introduce new and effective policy options into the national debate. The Project is named after Alexander Hamilton, the nation's fi rst Treasury Secretary, who laid the foundation for the modern American economy. Hamilton stood for sound fi scal policy, believed that broad- based opportunity for advancement would drive American economic growth, and recognized that \"prudent aids and encouragements on the part of government\" are necessary to enhance and guide market forces. The guiding principles of the Project remain consistent with these views.TACKLING THE TAX CODESHAMBAUGH / NUNNTACKLING TAX CODETHE EFFICIENT AND EQUIT ABLE WA YS TO RAISE REVENUE JA Y SHAMBAUGH and RY AN NUNNEdited byTHE UNITED ST A TES NEEDS ADDITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES for investments that support broadly shared growth, for fiscal balance, and for a more equitable tax code. The proposals in this volume respond to that need, focusing on the enduring questions about taxes\u2014who pays them, what effects do they have on the economy, and how much revenue can they raise? But this volume is about more than taxes. It is about providing for a strong and effective government that promotes not only growth but widespread economic well-being and reduced inequality for all Americans.
