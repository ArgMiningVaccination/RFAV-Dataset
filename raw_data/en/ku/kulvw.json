The NSQF sets common principles and guidelines for a nationally recog nized qualification system covering Schools, Vocational Education and Training Institutions, Technical Education Institutions, Colleges and Universities. It is envisaged that the NSQF will promote transparency of qualifications, cross -sectoral learning, st udent -centred learning and facilitate learners mobility between different qualifications, thus encouraging lifelong learning. The National Curriculum Framework, 2005 recommends that childrens life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home, community and the workplace. Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE), a constituent of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed modular curriculum and learning materials for the vocatio nal subjects offered from Classes IX to XII (NSQF Levels 1 -4). This Student Handbook, which has been developed keeping in view the National Occupational Standards (NOS) set by the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) for the Job Role of Patient Care Assi stant/ General Duty Assistant is meant for students who have passed Class -VIII or equivalent examination. The National Occupational Standards are a set of competency standards used for recognizing and assessing occupational skills and knowledge needed to perform effectively in the workplace. The success of vocationalisation of education in schools depends on the steps that Principals and Teachers will take to encourage children to reflect their own learning and to pursue imaginative and on -the-job training activities. Participation of learners in skill development exercises and inculcation of values and creativity is possible if we involve children as participants in learning and not as receivers of information. Flexibility in the daily time -table would be a necessity to maintain the rigour in implementing the activities and the required number of teaching days will have to be increased for teaching vocational subjects. The Student Handbook has been developed an d reviewed by a group of experts and their contributions are admirably acknowledged. The feedback and suggestions on the content by the teachers and other stakeholders will be of immense value to us in bringing about necessary improvement in the Student Handbook.

You will also study the significance of documentation in analyzing the needs of the patient. Relevant Knowledge Purpose of Documentation A) The purpose of documenting medical records are - i) Better and evidence based care, ii) accurate and faster diagnosis leading to better treatment at lower costs of care, iii) avoid repeating unnecessary investigations, iv) support personalized care, v) improved health policy decisions, vi) support medico - legal decisions, and vii) Effective communication among health professionals. All these translates into improved personal and public health. Patient Documentation is the written, legal record of all pertinent interactions with the patient - assessing, diagnosing, planning, implementing and evaluating. It is a legal record that is permanent and retrievable for future purposes. B)Documentation of patient's care promotes continuity of care throughout 24 hours of care. Team members who interact with the patient at different times and different ways get a clear picture of what took place in their absence. It is essential that all personnel provide written documentation of anything they have observed or done with a patient to ensure coordination of activities and continuity of care. Proper documentation informs appropriate personnel about a patients condition and response to illness and the care that has been given as the result of the illness. C) D o c u m e n t a t i o n h e l p s i n a u d i t i n g a n d t h u s , i m p r o v i n g q u a l i t y o f c a r e . Audit of patients records serves two purpose, quality assurance and reimbursement. As part of quality assurance programme, healthcare agencies periodically conduct chart audits to determine whether or not the care provided meets the established standards of patient care. Results of the audit can lead to changes in the manner in which care is provided. Session 1: Preparing Medical Record CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 17If deficiencies are found, training can be used to remedy the problem and improve the quality of care. Good medical documentation can help fill lacunae in the existing medical care and thus, planning of subsequent medical research. D) (iv) The patients record also serves are as documents for reimbursement process as well as a legal document of the patients health status and the care received. 11 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 18Sector: Healthcare (v) The medical team taking care of the patient is responsible for ensuring diagnostic and therapeutic orders that are entered in the patients record and implemented. Most often it is the policy of the healthcare agency that the diagnostic and therapeutic orders are written and is signed by the medical officer before it is being executed by the medical team. (vii) Exercise 1. Visit a nearby hospital and observe various medical records. Fill the name of record in the table given below: Purpose of Medical Record Name of Medical Record Assessment History Diagnostic Therapeutic Education Assessment A. Short Answer Questions: 1. What is Documentation? 12 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 19Sector: Healthcare Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity: Part A Differentiated between the following: 1. Diagnostic and therapeutic document Part B Discussed in class the following: 1. Purpose of documentation in hospital 2. Legal aspects of patients records Part C Performance Standards The performance standard may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of various medical records 13 Checklist for Assessment Activity CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 20Sector: Healthcare In this session, you will learn about the basic principles of documentation. Relevant Knowledge The patients medical record is the permanent legal record. Accepted terminology should be commonly understood by the healthcare team and should communicate clearly and concisely. Only standard medical and nursing terminology and community recognized abbreviation and symbols should be used to facilitate communication. Consistency in their use saves time and space, without interrupting communication. (i) The document should contain the date and time of each recording. (ii) Correct spelling of words should be used. Check the dictionary and use the correct spelling. (iii) Record only that information which pertains to the patients health problem and care. (iv) Accurate and complete documentation give legal protection to the GDA and other healthcare professionals of the institution. (v) Patients name and identification data must be written on each page of the clinical record. Entries must be accurate. An observation made by another health professional must be identified as such. (vi) Document all information necessary to explain the events in a shift. Anyone reading the document should have a clear picture of what took place or is being described. Complete, pertinent assessment data, such as vital signs, wound drainage, patients complaints, who notified GDA on subsequent shift, etc. can make objective evaluation and would help in revising the plan as needed. (vii) Good charting is concise and brief. Use partial sentences and phrases. Use only accepted abbreviations. (viii) Writing must be clear and easily readable by others. Legibility is all the more important while recording numbers and medical terms. (ix) Recording of information on the patients record must follow a chronological order. Charting statements must be logically organized according to time and content. Use of organized sequence will help to prevent omitting information about the patient. Documentation on data collection should be organized and logical in Session 2: Principles of Documentation CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 21 14 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 22Sector: Healthcare sequence. The statement is more easily read when written in a logical pattern. (x) Documentation in a timely manner can help avoid errors. Record all medications at the time they are given. Procedures, treatments and assessments should be recorded as soon as possible after their completion. Timelines help to avoid forgetting important information. (xi) While writing, if an error occurs, do not erase it. Common policies followed in such cases include,drawing a single line and writing the word void or error in the space above the incorrect entry , followed by the initials of the writer. A single line instead of multiple line is required to keep the incorrect entry legible. (xi) Blank spaces should not be left on the chart. Avoid writing outside the lines of the charting format. A horizontal line is drawn thought any empty space to the right margin to prevent later entries being made in front of a signature. (xii) A signature must follow every entry into a patients record. The correct way to sign a notation is using the first initial and full last name followed by the abbreviation of the healthcare workers position/title. (xiii) All patients records are confidential files that require written permission of the patient to be copied. Information within the chart is often of a personal matter as well as legal evidence of the care provided and should be available to the insurance companies or third party without the written permission of the patient. Those who are in need of patients information from records need to go through the proper channel which varies with the policies of the hospital. Exercise 1. Visit a nearby hospital and observe the various medical records. Fill the name of records Name of Record Designation of Healthcare Professional maintaining the Record 2. Visit a nearby hospital and examine a sample of patient case file and prepare the list of the content. Identify general types of information kept, such as referral letters, clinical notes, pharmacy or drug information and so on. Identify how the records are filled in chronological order. 15 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 23Sector: Healthcare Assessment A. Short Answer Questions: 1.

Importance of recording date and time in medical records 4. Role of GDA in maintaining and filing medical records 16 Checklist for Assessment Activity CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 24Sector: Healthcare Part C Performance Standards The performance standard may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of maintaining medical records 17 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 25Sector: Healthcare In this session, you will learn about the types of entries and notes to be prepared while maintaining the medical record of the patient. Description of observations, symptoms, complaints and medical treatments will also be studied in this session. Relevant Knowledge Content of Documentation Healthcare agencies/hospitals vary in their specific requirement about what need to be included in the chart. All significant patient care should be documented either in narrative notes or on flow sheets (forms use to document data that can be more easily followed in graphic or tabular form). On admission to a facility, a complete health history is obtained and documented. This is followed by the current need assessment. These may be combined or maintained on separate forms. Types of Entries Various types of entries may be made in a chart. They are described as followed: (i) Admission Note An admission note is part of medical record that documents the patients status, reasons why the patient is admitted for inpatient care to a hospital and the initial instructions for the patients care. It is the note acknowledges the arrival of a new patient. Following the admission note, a narrative entry is made. This is followed by a description of the patients current status at appropriate intervals. On arrival, patients orientation to the hospital facility should be made. The admission note usually include - time of arrival, age, sex, how the patient arrived, where the patient came from, medical diagnosis, chief complaint, general appearance, treatment in progress, allergies, vital signs and notifications of physician. An ideal admission note would include the following: (i) Patient Identifying Information l Name l ID number 18 Session 3: Content of Medical Documentation CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 26Sector: Healthcare l Chart number l Room number l Date of birth l Attending physician l Sex l Admission date l Date l Time l Service (ii) Chief Complaint (CC) l Age l Race l Sex l Present complaint (iii) History of Present Illness (HPI) l Statement of health status l Detailed description of chief complaint l Positive and negative symptoms related to the chief complaint based on the differential diagnosis the health care provider has developed. l Emergency actions taken and patient responses if relevant (iv) Allergies l First antigen and response l Second antigen and response (v) Past Medical History 19 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 27Sector: Healthcare List of the patient's on-going medical problems. Chronic problems should be addressed as to whether or not they are well controlled or uncontrolled. Include dates of pertinent items. (vi) Past Surgical History List of surgeries in the past with dates of pertinent items. (vii) Family history Health or cause of death for: l Parents l Siblings l Children l Spouse (viii) Social History In medicine, a social history is a portion of the admission note addressing familial, occupational, and recreational aspects of the patient's personal life that have the potential to be clinically significant. (ix) Medications l For each: generic name - amount - rate l Medications on arrival (aspirin, Goody's medicated powder, herbal remedies, prescriptions, etc.) l Medications on transfer (x) Review of Systems l General l Head l Eyes l Ears l Nose and sinuses 20 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 28Sector: Healthcare l Throat, mouth, and neck l Breasts l Cardiovascular system l Respiratory system l Gastrointestinal system l Urinary system l Genital system l Vascular system l Musculoskeletal system l Nervous system l Psychiatric l Hematologic system l Endocrine system (xi) Physical exam Physical examination or clinical examination is the process by which a health care provider investigates the body of a patient for signs of disease. (xii) Labs e.g.: electrolytes, arterial blood gases, e.g.: EKG, CXR, CT, MRI (xiv) Assessment and Plan Assessment includes a discussion of the differential diagnosis and supporting history and exam findings. (ii) Change of Shift Report During each shift, documentation of the patients assessment made is done. The \"Change of Shift Report\" is the communication between the nursing staff during shift 21 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 29Sector: Healthcare changeover periods regarding patient care. At the end of each shift nurses report information about their assigned patients to nurses working on the next shift. A handover report is usually given orally in person or during rounds at the bedside. Reports given in person or during rounds in hospital permit nurses to obtain immediate feedback when questions are raised about a patients/patients care. (iii) Assessment Notes Documentation of the complete assessment of patient is done. Assessment of the patients overall physical, emotional and behavioural state. Consideration for all patients include: looks well or unwell, pale or flushed, lethargic or active, agitated or calm, complaint or combative, posture and movement. (iv) Transfer and Discharge Notes When a patient is transferred to another facility either temporarily or permanently, a transfer note is written. This note may include the following: l Reason for transfer l Method of transportation l Person giving and receiving the report l Notification of the patient, including vital signs and treatments in progress. A similar note is made when a patient is sent for a test within the same facility. When the patient returns to unit a similar note may be made. (v) Patient Teaching Notes Instructions given to a patient need careful study. All teaching that occurs must be noted including reinforcement of the information already taught. It also must state the patients response to teaching. (vi) Symptoms and Complaints Any symptoms or complaints by patient should be documented in detail. This can include subjective or objective data and must be specific in terms of location, duration, intensity, amount, size and frequency. While documenting, the complaints of the patient, care given and response of the patient is also noted. (vii) Dressing Tubes or Attached Devices Observation of the tubes must be documented in the initial entry of each shift and at least every 2 hours thereafter. Documentation of dressing should include location of dressing, amount as well as description of any drainage observed. It the dressing is changed, condition of the skin wound also must be described. If I/V fluids are 22 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 30Sector: Healthcare administered, correct placement of the tube, observation of infusion site for any redness, tenderness edema or warmth, also must be documented. (viii) Medications and Treatments Usually there will be a medication administration record. When all the medicines are administered, charting is done. If any medication is not given, the reason for that should be documented and it is better to inform the physician concerned. Time, route and dosage of medicine and the reason for administration and the response of the patient are also documented. (ix) Observation of Psychosocial Status The patients sensorium in relation to level of consciousness and orientation to time, place and person are also documented. Patients leaving against medical advice (LAMA) must be documented clearly with the reason for the LAMA. Exercise 1. Visit a nearby hospital and list the contents of given records maintained in a hospital: Records Contents Pharmacy and Drug Records Administrative Records Nursing Records or Ward Records Legal Records Assessment A. Short Answer Questions 1. What is the full form of LAMA? 2. List the content of Admission Note 3. Describe the purpose of transfer and discharge note 23 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 31Sector: Healthcare Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity: Part A Differentiated between the following: 1. Assessment note and treatment note 2. Symptom note and medication note Part B Discussed in class the following: 1. Types of notes/reports maintained for a patient/patient 2. What is the role of a GDA/PCA in preparation and maintenance of physical assessment report? Part C Performance Standards The performance standard may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of content of medical documentation Arrange records Demonstrate the knowledge of types of entries in medical documentation 24 Checklist for Assessment Activity CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 32Sector: Healthcare Documentation is a set of documents provided on paper or on digital media. The procedure of documentation include drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reporting, tracking, etc. the purpose of complete and accurate documentation is to foster quality and continuity of care. In this session, you will learn about different methods of documentation and their formats. You will also study different types of records. Relevant Knowledge The different methods of documentation system are evolved to achieve specific aims. Familiarity with the different systems will enable you to adapt the appropriate system in a particular health care setting. Source Oriented Medical Record Source Oriented Medical Record is a type of medical record kept according to health discipline e.g., medicine, nursing, laboratory, X-ray etc. These records include information about care given, the patients response to care, and other events documented chronologically and sequentially in a specific location in the record designed for the particular health team member making the entry. The advantage is that the filing and retrieving of data is easy. It organizes the information according to patient care department that provided the care, or who provided the care. The main advantage of this format is that the filing of reports is easy. Professionals would just have to look at where the report came from and date, and file in that section. The main disadvantage is that it would be difficult to follow a certain course of treatment for the patient, since they would have to search through everything, making it time consuming. Also if a facility has many different departments, there will be even more sections in the record to search through. Problem Oriented Medical Records There is an index list that defines each problem. Everything is itemized and specific problems are organized into four parts. The main advantage is that it makes it easier to follow a course of treatment under a specific problem. However, this type would be time consuming as well, especially to file a new problem in it. The POMR consists of four components, the database, the problem list, initial plan for each problem and progress note for each problem. Documentation Format There are a variety of documentation format utilized by the health care provider. They include: 25 Session 4: Maintaining Record CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 33Sector: Healthcare (i) Narrative charting: It is a free style method of documentation. It is a method of charting that provides information in the form of statements that describe event surrounding patient care. It is often relatively unstructured and so provides flexibility in determining how information is recorded or the format may be structured and problem focused. (ii) Problem focused charting: This includes the following: A - Assessment P - Problem identification I - Intervention E - Evaluation The process begins with an admission assessment that is usually completed on a separate form and the initiation of a problem list that is based on the initial assessment. Documentation of patient care is focused on intervention and evaluation related to problems listed. Each entry in the progress note is preceded by the date, time, and problems listed. Maintenance of Records 1. The records are kept under the safe custody of the GDA in each ward or department. 2. No individual sheet is separated from the complete record. 3. Records are kept in a place, not accessible to the patients and visitors. 4. No stranger is ever permitted to read the records. 5. Records are not handed over to the legal advisors without the written permission of the administration. 6. All hospital personnel are legally and ethically obligated to keep in confidence all the informations provided in the records. 7. All records are to be handled carefully. Careless handling can destroy the records. 8. All records are filed according to the hospital custom so that they can be traced easily . 9. All records are identified with the bio-data of the patients such as name, age, ward, bed no., diagnosis etc. 10. Records are never sent out of the hospital without the doctors permission. 26 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 34Sector: Healthcare Reference is made by writing separate sheets and sending to the agency who requests for them. Types of Records 1. Outpatient and Inpatient Records - in most of the hospitals, the inpatient recorded will be continuation of the outpatient record. Outpatient record is continuation of the outpatient department. This will contain the filled up in the outpatient department. This will contain the biodata of the patient, diagnosis, family history, history of the past and present illness, signs and symptoms, findings of medical examination, investigations, treatments, medications progress notes and summary made at the discharge of the patient. 2. Doctor's Order Sheet - The doctors orders regarding the medication investigations, diet etc. may be written on separate sheets. 3. Graphic charts of T.P.R. - In this type of record, the temperature, pulse and respiration are written in a graphic form so that a slight deviation from the normal can be noted at a glance. 4. Reports of Laboratory Examination 5. Diet Sheets 6. Consent form for Operation and Anesthesia 7. Intake and Output Chart - Patients on intravenous fluids or on the fluid diet, critically ill patient post - operative patients, patient with oedema, patients having vomiting and diarrhea, patients getting diuretics etc. 8. Reports of Anesthesia, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and other Special Treatment 9. Registers - To maintain the statistics, every hospital maintains certain register, such as resisters for the births and deaths, registers for operations and deliveries, census register, register for the admission and discharge, register for the OPD attendants, etc. Documentation of Medico -legal cases The important documents to be maintained by the hospital in Medico -legal cases are as follows: (i) Police intimation: This has to be given to the nearest police station by the hospital. (ii) Wound certificate: These are given on request by the police. It must be duly signed by the medical officer, who has attended the patient. (iii) Discharge certificate - this is given on demand from the police for MLC cases 27 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 35Sector: Healthcare (iv) Accident cum wound register: this is usually maintained by the casualty medical officer. In case the patient demands, medical certificate may have to be issued by the hospital. Medication Record This is a record which keeps track of medicines taken by the patient. It includes date, time, route of drug, frequency and signature of GDA. Nursing Discharge / Referral Summaries This is made on discharge of a patient or at the time of transfer of a patient to another health care institution. Role of GDA in Maintaining the Records The major role of GDA is to compile, process and maintain medical records, which include information about the patients care on the following aspects: Baths Showers Oral care Denture care Foot care Hair and nail care Urinary catheter care Back care Turning and positioning Meal intake Fluid intake Activities, like walking Range of motion exercises if done 28 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 36Sector: Healthcare Warm soaks Height Weight Urinary drainage bag output Temperature Pulse Respiration rate Blood pressure Blood glucose readings Exercise 1.

You will also learn about basics of care of elderly. Relevant Knowledge Elderly care, or simply eldercare (also known as aged care), is the fulfillment of the special needs and requirements that are unique to aged people. This broad term encompasses services, such as assisted living, adult day care, long term care, nursing homes (often referred to as residential care), hospice care, and home care. Elderly care emphasizes the social and personal requirements of seniorcitizens who need some assistance with daily activities and health care, but who desire to age with dignity. Traditionally, elderly care has been the responsibility of family members and was provided within the extended family home. Increasingly in modern societies, elderly care is now being provided by state or charitable institutions. Ageing is an inevitable process of life. Sudden spurt in the population of elderly in a country is bound to pose multiple challenges before the human society. Ageing has gone beyond the realm of welfare concern and needs to be viewed as a developmental challenge. Many elderly people gradually lose functioning ability and require either additional assistance in the home or a move to an eldercare facility. Assisted living is one option for the elderly who need assistance with everyday tasks. In India, parents are typically cared for by their children into old age. Indian values demand honour and respect for older people. Currently there is an estimated 6.9% in the age group of 55-64 years and 5.7% for 65 and above elderly in India (Census of India, 2011). A distinction is generally made between medical and non -medical care, care provided by people who are not medical professionals. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, the caregivers should encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence. It can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer. 34 Session1: Introduction to Care of Elderly CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 43Sector: Healthcare Think about Elderly All of us know \"old\" people. It may be a parent. It may be a grandparent. It may be a neighbour. It may also be the person that you take care of. Think for a minute about these \"old\" people. Are they all the same? Or, are they different? Think about how they all are in a physical way. Are they all in poor health? Think about how they are in a mental way. Are they all confused? Think about how they are in a social way. Do they go out or do they all stay alone in their home? Think about how they are in terms of money. Do all \"old\" people have the same spiritual needs? Are they different or, are they all the same? Use these words for these ages: Age Groups Age Span Infant Birth to 1 year Toddler 1 to 3 years Preschool child 3 to 5 years School age child 5 to 12 years Adolescent 12 to 18 years Young Adult 18 to 45 years Middle Age Adult 45 to 65 years Old Adult Over 65 Biological Aging Some people say that people age because the cells of the body change or \"age\" over time. The person may have their own \"biological clock\". This clock keeps ticking as the cells of the body and the body itself changes. For example, a woman reaches menopause; hair turns gray; and the skin changes. Psycho -Social Aging Some believe that people age for a number of things NOT having to do with the human body . These people believe that people age because they: separate themselves from the people around them; no longer keep their body active (active people tend to be happier with life); and separate themselves from the people around them AND they no longer keep their body active. Myths and Fact about Aging There are many things said about older people that are just not true. 35 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 44Sector: Healthcare Some of these false myths are below: All old people are the same Old people cannot learn Old people are forgetful All old people will get confused and senile Old people are sick and frail Old people become sicker and sicker as they age Old people cannot exercise Old people depend on others Old people are usually lonely, alone and withdrawn All old people are NOT the same. Often the age of the person is not the best way to know about the person and his/her strengths and weaknesses. Some 90-year-old people exercise daily; some take college courses; some are very active in their area of work or belief. Ageing does not affect our personality. It remains about the same. Old people keep these personality differences as they age. Old people can still learn and they are not always \"forgetful\". Aging does not mean that the person cannot learn. Some have short -term memory problems but they cope with this and can learn. Confusion is NOT a normal sign of aging. Many old people are NOT sick and frail. Some are very healthy and without any disability. Older people can, and should, exercise on a daily basis. Healthy aging involves many things, including a good diet and exercise. Although some older people may need some assistance because they have some disability, many more are NOT dependent on others. Old people do NOT have to lose their teeth. Good dental care is needed for keeping teeth healthy and strong. Socially, NOT all old people are lonely, alone and withdrawn. They remain active. Many old people remain active and involved with family, friends and other friends. Some may enter a senior group home or an assisted living place with lots of activities. However, all old people need care and greater attention by their family members, friends and colleagues. 36 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 45Sector: Healthcare Exercise 1.

Health -related Changes Slowing down of mind and thinking ability Slowing down of the bodys physical function A slowing down of the persons coping Less social support Losses of loved ones (friends, husband, wife) Lower quality of life Thinking and Emotional Changes and Needs Not all old people have a mental problem or confusion. These things are NOT a normal change. Most are fine in terms of their thinking, learning and communication, but some have a disease or problem that affects these things. Some of these problems are things like Alzheimers and some drugs. It is also known that the personality of the person does not change, as the person gets old. Social Changes and Needs There are many social changes and needs for old people. Many of these are related to the fact that loved ones, both friends and spouses, may have died. Others miss working after they retire. Others may have a physical problem that does not let them to be with others as they used to do. For example, some old people lose their sight so they are not able to drive their car; some may have muscle weakness so they cannot take long walks as they used to. Legal Needs The elderly also have their own legal needs. Some of these special needs are: Maintaining rights and dignity 42 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 51Sector: Healthcare Power of attorney/ other financial issues Prevention from being abuse Prevention from violence Old adults do not have the same appetite that they had when they were younger. Their need for large amounts of food and calories is lowered. They may also not want to eat. If the sense of taste and smell are gone, they may not enjoy food as much as they did when they were younger. As the human body ages, it slows down and it does not work as well as it did in the past. For example, digestion slows down. Foods that are eaten take longer to digest. It also takes longer to burn the calories that we eat. Vision and hearing may also get poor as a person gets older. Many old patients and residents use eyeglasses, hearing aids and devices as they get older. The old adult may also have weak muscles, unstable joints and poor balance. These things can make an old person fall or slip. Falls and slips can break bones and even lead to death. Many elderly people also have long-term diseases that affect how we care for them. Many older people have diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimers disease, heart, lung and kidney disease. They are also not able to fight off infections as well as they did when they were young. Old patients are at great risk of getting an infection, like pneumonia or a urinary tract infection, because their immune system has slowed down. The aging process also affects the skin of old people. The skin gets dry and easily irritated; it breaks down and tears very easily for many patients and residents. Also, the body temperature is not controlled as well as it was in the past. Old patients feel extremes of hot and cold more than younger people. Mental ability also changes as one gets older. Mentally, many old residents and patients are confused. They forget things quickly. They are not able to remember recent events. They may not know the time of day, the day of the week or even the current year. Some do not know, or cannot remember, where they are and who they are. They are disoriented. They are not oriented to person, place and time. They may also be agitated and use poor judgment. Others may have delirium, dementia and depression. All of these normal aging changes affect the kind of care we must provide to our aging patients. 43 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 52Sector: Healthcare Exercise 1.

State any five changes that occurs in the body during old age Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity: Part A Differentiated between the following: 1. Social and psychological needs of old people 2. Emotional and healthcare needs of old people Part B Discussed in class the following: 1. Why old people need more care than young ones? 2. What changes take place when we grow old? Part C Performance Standards The performance standard may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No Identify the normal changes that occur in old age 44 Checklist for Assessment Activity CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 53Sector: Healthcare In this session, you will learn about the safety, security, food and fluid needs of the elderly people. Relevant Knowledge The General Duty Assistant (GDA) and other healthcare workers care for oldpatients and residents all over the world. In the India today there are more aged people than people of any other age group. Some Tasks for the Elderly Erik Erikson, a psychologist, listed 8 major developmental tasks that every person must accomplish during life. The General Duty Assistant and other healthcare providers must know about these major tasks. For example, to take care of adolescents one must know that adolescents have to cope with identity formation - \"Who am I?\". A hospital staff can affect an adolescent's sense of self, it can also help to keep in touch with their friends or peer group; a group that is much more important to them than their own family. Their peer group helps them to define who they are. According to Erikson, older adults want to share their wisdom, maintain their sense of self, maintain integrity and be happy with what they have done. Old adults who can NOT do these tasks may be sad, depressed and unhappy. They may view their life as worthless and without meaning. They may think that they are useless. Some may feel that they are a burden to their family, friends and healthcare workers. Old adults also have to deal with losses. They may lose their husband or wife, their friends and other people who they loved. They may feel lonely and not loved. They can also be very sad and depressed. As they get older and lose their own mental and physical health, they may NOT be able to care for themselves any more. This may make the patient or resident sad or angry. All of these losses make the old person feel that they are no more needed in this world or they too will die one day. They give their own things and prized possessions to their family and loved ones. Some older adults may think silently about these losses and their own death. They may also review their own life and what they have done in silence. Other old adults may speak about their losses to nurses, General Duty Assistant, social workers, family and others. As a healthcare provider, we should listen to the older patient when they talk about their losses and their thoughts about death. Thinking and Learning Abilities The thinking and learning abilities of the older adults affect how we communicate, instruct and teach them and their family members. Older adults need special care during communication and instruction for doing exercise, etc. They often have a 45 Session 3: Basic Needs of Elderly CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 54Sector: Healthcare physical and mental problem that can interfere with learning and thinking. Older adults may have: A short attention span: Old adults may not be able to understand long and detailed information. They may do better with short instructions. Less learning ability: Old people may not be able to learn new things as well as they did in the past. Less ability to understand: Many older adults are confused and not able to understand. An inability to communicate: Older adults may not be able to speak and ask questions. After a stroke, many patients have aphasia; a lack of ability to speak. Poor hearing and sight: Vision and hearing gets poor as humans age. GDA and others must give a patient their eyeglasses and/or their hearing aid so they can communicate easily . When a GDA are communicating with an elderly patient, he/she should: Give the person their eyeglasses and hearing aid, if they have one Speak slowly and clearly while facing the person Keep information simple Use words that the person can understand Use pictures and large print material Provide enough light if the patient wants to read Keep sessions short Repeat communication as often as needed so that the patient can understand it and remember it Allow enough time for the patient. Some patients need more time than others Make sure that the area or room is quiet Allow the person to talk and ask questions Include the loved ones in the communication and instruction process. Safety and Security Needs The need for safety and security is one of our most basic human needs. Safety is very important for all age groups but safety needs are the greatest for young children and the elderly. For example, infants put small objects in their mouths. These small things can be dangerous. They can eat pills, poisons and even choke on something small. 46 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 55Sector: Healthcare Similarly, the old adults who have a mental, sensory (eyes, ears) or physical loss are at greater risk and prone to accidents. An old patient that has poor vision and hearing is generally confused and has poor judgment. He is prone to slip, fall, cut, bruises, etc. Physical problems, confusion, loss of hearing and vision, poor judgment and the inability to see danger when it exists are some of the reasons why healthcare providers must maintain a safe environment for the elderly. Safety of the patients is everyone's responsibility. Safety needs must ALWAYS be a priority. All patients and patient care areas must be safe and free of all dangers. Food and Fluid Needs Food and nutritional needs also change as a person gets older and older. The need for calories decreases when a person gets older. These needs are highest when the person was an infant or a teen. Old patients and residents need the least calories of all age groups. They do not burn calories and food as quickly as they did when they were younger and more active. This does not mean, however, that the elderly do not need a good diet. Older patients do need a good diet just like the other age groups. The appetite and the digestive process slows down as the human body ages. Old adults do not feel as hungry as they did when they were young. Also, when they eat meals they feel full and they may not want to eat another meal for a long time. They may even skip a meal. Old adults often do better with small snacks during the day rather than large meals three times a day. In terms of fluid needs (hydration), an elderly patient may not be able to swallow fluids. They may not even feel thirsty when they should under normal conditions. We must, therefore, offer fluids very often to elderly. The GDA should use apron and proper utensils for feeding the elderly patients. Exercise 1. Visit a nearby hospital and observe the old age patients and write the safety related requirement and care rendered by GDA in the table given below: Safety related needs of Patient Care rendered by GDA Assessment A. Short Answer Questions 47 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 56Sector: Healthcare 1. Explain the security and safety needs of an elderly Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity: Part A Differentiated between the following: 1. Thinking and learning abilities 2. Security and safety of patients Part B Discussed in the class following: 1. Physical and mental care of the elderly Part C Performance Standards The performance standard may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of tasks performed by elderly people Describe the procedure of feeding old age patients 48 Checklist for Assessment Activity CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 57Sector: Healthcare In this session, you will learn about the common problems that elderly face and the procedures to be adopted for taking care of these problems. Relevant Knowledge Taking Care of Skin and Nails The skin becomes thinner, dry, pale, fragile, rough, less elastic, with less sweat glands and fat. The older person may get these problems as a result of these changes. Skin tears (thin and fragile skin) Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers: The skin is thin, dry, fragile and has less cushion as the person ages. Skin cancer and sun burns. The pale and fragile skin makes the person prone to sunburns and skin cancer. Rashes and infections like contact allergies with some soaps and shingles. Less able to cope with heat and cold: The person may get too cold because they have less fat tissue. The person may also get too hot because they have less \"cooling off\" sweat glands. Pressure Ulcer: Pressure ulcers occur when people are not up and walking. Patients and residents with a poor diet are at risk for pressure ulcers. Residents and patients who are wet are at risk for pressure ulcers. People that do not have a normal sense of pain and the physical ability to turn will remain in one position for a very long time unless someone else turns them. If a patient stays in one position for a long time, they will get a pressure ulcer. Friction occurs when a patient or resident is pulled up in bed or in the chair. Uneven pressure is created when sheets are wrinkled. This leads to pressure ulcers. A General Duty Assistant should render the following care as par the needs of the patient: Dry skin care: Skin lotions and mild soaps should be used. Also, the person does not always need a daily bath or shower. Skin tears and other skin breakdown: The older person must not be gripped during a transfer. This can lead to a skin tear. Pressure ulcers are very painful and costly. People on bed rest are most at risk. 49 Session 4: Taking Care of Common Problems of Elderly CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 58Sector: Healthcare Provide good skin care: Use mild soap and gentle strokes with a soft washcloth when giving a bath to a resident or patient. Rinse the skin well and then pat it dry with a soft towel. Use a bland lotion to help dry skin. Lotion helps to keep the skin healthy and soft. Do NOT use alcohol or alcohol base lotions on skin. Alcohol dries the skin. Keep the skin clean and dry: Immediately remove all wet or dirty linens, briefs and clothing. Do not let the patient remain wet or dirty with urine, feces or other fluids, including water or tea. Wash, rinse and dry all wet and dirty skin. Patients and residents who stay in bed, the chair or wheelchair must be moved and re- positioned at least every 2 hours. Encourage patients to walk around. Walking and moving about increases blood flow. Anticipate the patient's need to use the commode or bathroom. Follow the patient's bowel and bladder training programme if it is ordered. Encourage the person to eat good foods and lots of fluids. Use pressure reducing cushions, mattresses, beds, booties, elbow pads, etc. These items lower pressure when patients stay in bed or chair for long period of time. Do NOT elevate the head of the bed more than 30 degrees, unless ordered. Do NOT allow a patient to remain on a bedpan for a long period of time. Do NOT drag a person's body along bed sheets. Lifting devices and lifting sheets lower friction and shear. They also prevent patient and staff injury . The feet and toes should be washed and dried during every bath and kept clean. Leaving the area between the toes wet can lead to soft skin that could break down. It is also important to use a good skin lotion on the feet but NOT between the toes. This will soften the area and make it more prone to sores. Nails should be clean, short and smooth. Dirty fingernails spread infection. Jagged fingernails can cause injury. Nail care is done best when the person is sitting in a chair. If the person is not able to sit in a chair, it can be done in the bed. 50 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 59Sector: Healthcare Taking Care of Bones As the body ages, the bones lose calcium, get weak, thin, brittle and weak. Spine get smaller. Joints become less flexible and less mobile. Many people get broken bones and fractures because of these changes. Falls can lead to injury and even death. The most common problems of the bones are: Osteoporosis Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Gout Bursitis In order to provide necessary care to the bones, the GDA can help their patients in the following ways: Provide patient with a good healthy diet. Make sure that they get enough calcium and vitamin D. Encourage them to perform daily exercise. Active exercise and range of motion, Passive range of motion Encourage the person to walk and get out of bed Prevent falls Nurses and other people that work in homes, hospitals and nursing homes, like the doctor and the physical therapist, must assess a resident or patient for falls. They have to find out if the patient or resident is at risk for falls. Move the patient's bed and/or room closer to the nursing station. Regular rest and sleep. Taking Care of Muscle Problems Regular exercise is very important in order to maintain and improve muscle function. The GDA should help the patient to do range of motion exercise so that they can move their muscles and joints completely. GDA and other members of the team often help and/or remind the patient or resident to perform these exercises. When a person is not able to do these transfers they must depend on others for help and GDA can do it in better way. 51 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 60Sector: Healthcare Teach the patient to practice how to walk up and down stairs using a handrail. When a person walks up the stairs they should put their good leg up on the stair and then bring up the weak one. Taking Care of Respiratory System The GDA should take all precautions to prevent lung infection and help patients to keep respiratory system normal. The following points should be kept in mind by the GDA while helping a patient in keeping his/her respiratory system fit. COPD is treated with a number of medicines, including those that dilate the lungs and keep the respiratory secretions thin so that they can be coughed up. Also advice good diet, plenty of fluids, oxygen, and deep breathing exercises. Lung cancer is treated with surgery, radiation and drugs. Pain, a poor appetite, nausea and vomiting may be issues with cancer patients. The GDA can provide the person with a good diet and fluids; make the person as comfortable as possible; and observe the persons coughing, chest pain and blood in the sputum. Report anything that is NOT normal. When the person has the flu, the GDA should observe the persons coughing, chest pain and blood in the sputum. Report anything that is NOT normal; and give the person as much comfort as possible. The treatment of pneumonia includes drugs to kill the germs supportively by rest, fluids, a good diet, pulmonary hygiene and oxygen. The GDA must observe all of their patients about their breathing, especially older people. They must immediately report anything that is not normal. Taking Care of Heart Problems The GDA should encourage patients to do mild exercises regularly. Exercise and a healthy weight also important in keeping the blood pressure at a good level. Heart attacks are treated with rest, oxygen, a number of different medications, including aspirin, which thins the blood, and pain medications to help the pain and to ease the amount of work that the heart has to do as a result of the pain. The GDA can help the person to prevent a heart attack by giving healthy diet, encouraging them to exercise and reminding them to take their heart medicines. The GDA can care for the person Peripheral Vessel Problems by encouraging the person to walk and then to rest if pain begins, checking the feet and toes regularly for any signs of a sore, giving the person good foot care, encouraging the person to stop smoking if they do so, giving the person a good diet with lots of fruit, vegetables and whole grains rather than fats and salt. 52 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 61Sector: Healthcare Taking Care of Digestion Problems The GDA can help patients in taking care of their digestion related problems by performing the following activities: Advising smaller meals spread out during the day, sit up after a meal, rather than lying down, provide a good diet with low fat and caffeine in case of hernia. Encouraging NOT to drink wine or smoke and helping the person to cope with stress. Reporting any pain or bleeding in stool to the doctor. When the GDA cares for a person with incontinence, the area must be washed with a no rinse skin cleanser or alcohol free wipes. The area should be air dried. A special cream should also be used on clean dry skin to prevent skin breakdown and to keep all stool away from the skin. Cornstarch can also be used. The GDA should advice at least 20 to 40 grams of fiber/day, fruit, vegetables, beans, bran and whole grains, plenty of fluids such as water and juice and exercise on a daily basis. Urine System Good hygiene, hand washing and encouraging the person to have water in their diet helps in preventing urine infections. Bladder training along with medicine and surgery is done, in some cases of Incontinence. Smaller meals, control of the diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure, treatment of urine infections, low salt and protein in the diet advised to the patient with kidney failure. Nervous System The GDA must maintain safety and ensure good nutrition to support patients who are suffering from lack of ability to do simple things like eating and wearing clothes. If a patient in the early stage of the nervous disease is able to dress and bath without help, he/she should help them to remain as active and as independent as possible. If the patient is at risk for falls, we must make sure that their room and the nursing unit is safe, secure, neat and uncluttered. Keep the patient care area bright. Keep stimulation and noise to a minimum. Use large clocks, calendars and other things to orient the patient. Take away all clutter and dangerous chemicals, like medicines and cleaning liquids in order to ensure safety. 53 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 62Sector: Healthcare Taking Care of Eyes The older persons, who have vision problems, need assistance with many activities of daily living (ADL), including dressing, walking and eating. The need for safety, freedom from falls, and other injuries (cooking fires) are of utmost importance. Encourage older patients to have regular, annual eye examination and use their eye drugs. The GDA should also observe and report any changes in the persons vision. Special low vision programme help patients on use of special things that help the person to read, write and do other things. For example, they may get special lighting, magnifiers, large print reading materials, computers that talk, clocks and watches that talk and/or have larger numbers. Taking Care of Ears The GDA should advice patients to use all the time hearing aid in case of hearing loss. Speak slowly and clearly while facing the person, keep information simple, use words that the person can understand, use pictures and large print material. Provide enough light if the patient is reading. Repeat communication as often as needed so that the patient can understand it and remember it. Exercise 1.

Part C Performance Standards The performance standard may include, but not limited to: Performance standards Yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of the role of GDA in providing care according to Patients need 55 Checklist for Assessment Activity CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 64Sector: Healthcare Relevant Knowledge The General Duty Assistant and other healthcare workers must know how to t ake care for babies and children. This care must meet the special needs of these age groups. GDA, nurses and many others get a lot of joy as they care for children but there are also a lot of challenges. The Age Groups Infants and children have many age related needs. These patients belong to one of these are groups: INFANTS - Birth to 1 year TODDLER - 1 to 3 years PRE-SCHOOL CHILD - 3 to 5 years SCHOOL CHILD - 5 to 12 years ADOLESCENT (TEENAGER) - 12 to 18 years A new baby is an infant from the minute they are born until they have their 1st birthday. They are a toddler after their 1st birthday and until they are 3 years of age. These young children begin to walk and toddle around the house. From the age of 3 until 5, a child is in the pre-school age group. The young child has not yet started the first grade of school. From 5 to 12 years of age, the child is considered a school age child. The last stage of childhood is adolescence. A boy or girl is a teenager, or adolescent, from 12 to 18 years of age. After the age of 18, the child is considered a young adult and able to make legal decisions of their own. Growth and Development of Children The General Duty Assistant (GDA) and other healthcare providers must know about the major tasks for each of the age groups. A teenager's sense of self must be encouraged when they are in the hospital for a long period of time. When this age group is in the hospital they are not with their friends. Their group of friends helps them define who they are. Friends have become much more important to the teenager than their own family. Things that each age group 56 Session 5: Caring for Infants and Children CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 65Sector: Healthcare must do are listed below for the infant, toddler, pre-school child, school age child and adolescent. Infants - learn how to trust others. They are not yet able to do anything for themselves. They depend on others to feed them and to keep them safe. They need to be loved. They need others to keep them clean and dry. They must feel that their needs will be met as soon as they begin to cry. Toddlers - begin to take care of themselves and do things on their own. They learn to control themselves and what they do. They learn how to walk around, feed themselves, use the toilet and control their own behavior. This age group does not like to be frustrated. They also want to be with their parents. They do not like people that they do not know. Pre-School Children - start to act with a purpose and a goal. They begin to feel happy about what they can do. This age group is afraid of being punished and rejected. School Age Children - want to be confident. They want to do well in school. They try very hard to please their teachers and their parents. School age children want to feel that they are competent and able to do things on their own. Adolescents or Teenagers - want to be a part of a group. They need to have a sense of self and know who they are. They form their own identity when they belong to a group. Also, they often rebel against their parents. Keeping Children Safe Safety is one of the most basic human needs. Children have the greatest safety needs. For example, infants will put almost anything in their mouth, including poison and small things that they can choke on. We must, therefore, prevent poisoning and choking by keeping dangerous things away from infants and small children. In addition to putting strange things in their mouth, infants and young children also do NOT know the difference between things that are safe and those that are not. They are very curious and they will try just about anything. They have little or no fear about getting hurt. It is our job to watch them very closely so they do not injure themselves while we are taking care of them in the home or in the hospital. Taking Care of Nutrition of Infants and Children Nutritional and hydration needs also change as a person ages. Infants need extra iron and the fats from whole milk, formula or breast milk. Infants get baby foods at about 4 to 6 months of age starting with cereal. New foods should be added slowly and ONE at a time so that new foods that cause problems can be identified right away. Toddlers like to eat foods that they can pick up with their hands and eat. They start to use cups instead of bottles. They may even begin to use a spoon to feed themselves. 57 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 66Sector: Healthcare Pre-school children start to decide what foods they like and dislike. They use a fork, knife and spoon to eat. Teenager s need extra calories, protein , calcium, iron, iodin e and B complex vitamins for their growth. They often do not get a good diet. They eat a lot of snacks and \"fast food\". They also do not stick to regular meal times. Many teenagers develop eating disorders that can lead to poor health. Infants need frequent small feedings. They have to be kept warm with a blanket and proper clothing because their body is not yet able to control its own temperature. Infants can also become dehydrated very quickly, especially if they have diarrhea or vomiting. They have to be kept safe and away from infections because their body is not able to fight off infections as older children and adults can. The vital signs of the infant, child and pre-teen/teen are different. The usual vital signs are as follows: Normal ranges for vital signs Vital Sign Infant Child Pre-Teen/Teen 0 to 12 months 1 to 11 years 12 and up Heart Rate 100 to 160 beats per minute (bpm) 70 to 120 bpm 60 to 100 bpm Respiration (breaths) 0 to 6 months 30 to 60 breaths per minute (bpm) 6 to 12 months 24 to 30 bpm 0 to 6 months 1 to 5 years 20 to 30 (bpm) 6 to 11 years 12 to 20 bpm 12 to 18 bpm1 Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic) 65 to 90/45 to 65 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) 6 to 12 months 80 to 100/55 to 65 mm Hg 90 to 110/55 to 75 mm Hg 110 to 135/65 to 85 mm Hg Temperature All ages 98.6 F (normal range is 97.4 F to 99.6 F) All ages 98.6 F (normal range is 97.4 F to 99.6 F) All ages 98.6 F (normal range is 97.4 F to 99.6 F) Infants must be held, cuddled and touched. The mother, father, sisters and brothers are the most important people to them. They do NOT want to be separated from them. They often cry when the parents are not seen. We should encourage the family 58 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 67Sector: Healthcare members to stay with the infant and young children, whenever this is possible.

You will study about the risks involved with poor waste management, classification of hospital waste and disposal of biomedical waste. Relevant Knowledge In hospital waste management, the popular term is bio-medical waste. Bio- medical waste is defined as \"waste that is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings and are contaminated with patients body fluids, such as syringes, needles, ampoules, organs and body parts, placenta, dressings, disposables plastics and microbiological wastes\". India generates around 1 -2 kg per bed per day in a hospital and 600 gm per day per bed in a clinic. This medical waste need to be disposed off effectively. Of the total amount of waste generated by health -care activities, about 85% is general, non - hazardous waste. The remaining 15% is c onsidered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic or radioactive. Definitions Before we study the classification and disposal of hospital waste, let us first try to understand the meaning of some of the terminologies used in hospital waste management: Infectious waste: waste contaminated with blood and other bodily fluids (e.g. from discarded diagnostic samples),cultures and stocks of infectious agents from laboratory work (e.g. waste from autopsies and infected animals from laboratories), or waste from patients with infections (e.g. swabs, bandages and disposable medical devices); Pathological waste: human tissues, organ s or fluids, body parts and contaminated animal carcasses; Sharps waste: syringes, needles, disposable scalpels and blades, etc.; Chemical waste: for example solvents and reagents used for laboratory preparations, disinfectants, sterilants and heavy metals contained in medical devices (e.g. mercury in broken thermometers) and batteries; Pharmaceutical waste: expired, unused and contaminated drugs and vaccines; Cyctotoxic waste: waste containing substances with genotoxic properties (i.e. highly hazardous sub stances that are, mutagenic, teratogenic or carcinogenic), such as cytotoxic drugs used in cancer treatment and their metabolites; Session 1: Introduction to Bio-medical Waste Management CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 77 Radioactive waste: such as products contaminated by radionuclides including radioactive diagnostic material or radiotherapeut ic materials; and Non-hazardous or general waste: waste that does not pose any particular biological, chemical, radioactive or physical hazard. These type of wastes may be gemerated from various sources. As per the nomenclature the waste generated include s as follow: 1. General Waste: The waste generated from office, administrative offices, kitchen, laundry and stores. 2. Sharps: Hypodermic needles, needles attached to tubing, scalpel blades, razor, nails, broken glass pieces, etc. 3. Infected waste: Equipment and instruments used for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, waste from surgery like tissues and organs removed and autopsy. 4. Chemical waste: Formaldehyde used for preserving tissues and organs, fixer and developers used in radiology department. Solvents like xylene, acetone, ethanol and methanol used in laboratories. 5. Radioactive waste: Various radioactive wastes generated through the activities of the department like research activity, clinical laboratory and nuclear medicine department 67 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 78Sector: Healthcare 6. Cytotoxic drugs: Various anti-cancer drugs. CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 79Sector: Healthcare Hospital Waste Management The hospitals are visited by the patients for treatment and they are accompanied by close associates, friends or relatives, who prefer to stay with patients for taking care of their non-medical needs. In addition to the attendants of the patients, a large number of visitors also visit the hospital. Therefore, involvement of hospital staff along with the patients and relatives becomes very important for proper segregation and management of Hospital waste, The staff working in the hospitals is directly exposed to the risks of the hospital wastes. The healthcare worker by virtue of their profession has to work with sharps like needle, blades, etc. and they are at risk of contracting that infection. There is risk of transmission of infections by Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired immune -Deficiency Syndrome ( HIV/AIDS), and Hepatitis B and C viruses . The implications of the management of hospital waste by health care workers and hospital administration can be emphasized on the basis of following points: (i) The hospital staff is responsible for generating, segregating, collecting, storing and treating of the hospital waste. (ii) (iii) The hospital authorities must organize teaching and training programmes for the healthcare workers and must provide appropriate protectives measures includinggloves, masks, foot wears, goggles, gum boots, gowns, head gear, etc. It is essential to segregate the wastes suitably as per the latest guidelines in the designated bins rather than putting it all in single bin. This requires not only arrangement of separate bins but also the appropriate training of the hospital staff accor dingly. *Insert WHO photograph of Waste Segregation Bins* CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 80 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 81 The internal environment of the hospital has got direct communication with the outside environment. The gases and heat generated inside the hospitals are exhausted into the external environment. The internal environment of the hospital is contaminated with bacteria, viruses and parasites, which canpose a threat of spreading infection to the outside environment. The foul gases from mortuary or foul smelling discharges from the labour room, pathology department, anatomy department are discharged directly to the outside environment, which are responsible for the environmental pollution. All such activities have invited attention of CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 82Sector: Healthcare the environmentalists and the Government have enacted laws to protect the health of the people and also to safeguard the environment. d) Hospital acquired infections (Nosocomial Infections): Nosocomial infections are infections that have been acquired in a hospital and are potentially caused by organisms that are resistant to antibiotics. It is the infection that was not present or incubating prior to the patients being admitted to the hospital, but occurs within 72 hours after admittance to the hospital. The sources of hospital acquired infection can be self, by other patients, attendants, visitors and hospital staff or through fomites ( any object or substance capable of carrying infectious organisms) e) The routes of transmission of infection can be: a) Air bornefor example, through inhalation of hospital dust. b) Direct contact for example, through abrasions on skin, or through mucous membrane. c) Faeco - oral route for example, through ingestion of food, water with contaminated hands d) Parenteral route during the process of injections and infusions. e) Through equipment and materials.

All the medical staff, nursing staff, technical and non technical staff have different responsibilities and they all work in close harmony. Training of staff is don e on \"technical skills \" and \"non-technical skills \". The former include s the psychomotor dexterity , coordination and decision making that are required to carry out complex psychomotor tasks (e.g. to successfully do a surgical or anaesthesia procedure ). This require dedicated training programme like B.Sc. (Nursing)/ MBBS/ MS/ MD in their respective fields. In case of latter, a healthcare provider is trained to work effectively as a member of a team and should possess skills like communication skill, leadershi p skills, interpersonal skills, coping with stress, etc. Patient safety is of utmost importance. Open communication and effective interdisciplinary teamwork helps in successfully achieving the target of providing safety to the patients. Teamwork can be d efined as a set of interrelated behaviours, actions, cognitions and attitudes that facilitate the required task work that must be completed. Team -members must possess specific knowledge, skills and attitudes to achieve the goals. Exercise 1. Visit a near by hospital and prepare the list of staff working in the OT.

Relevant Knowledge The GDA is responsible for the following tasks or activities in the post operative phase: 1. The patients bed is prepared before he comes back from the operation theater. Other preparations include the following: (a) The bed is made warm with the use of hot water bottles and bags. (b) Extra blankets are used to keep the bed warm. (c) The following articles are kept ready near the bed. CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 114 10 3 Sector: Healthcare (i) Oxygen cylinder (ii) Saline stand (iii) Bed blocks (iv) Postanesthetic tray (v) Injection tray (vi) Intravenous infusion tray 2. It is preferable to have a recovery room in which the patient is kept before he/ she can be shifted to the ward. The proportion of specialist doctors, Nurses and GDA is higher in the recovery roo m, so that the patient receives better care than he would in the ward. The following equipment are kept ready in the recovery room: (a) Suction machine (b) Oxygen (c) Sphygmomanometer (d) Equipment for intravenous infusion. (e) Blood transfusion equipment (f) Bed blocks(g) Respi rator. (h) Railing cots (i) Cardioscope (j) Cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment 3. Before bringing the patient from the recovery room the following observations are made: (a) Patency of airway (b) Respiration : normal or abnormal (c) Temperature (d) Pulse CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 115 10 4 Sector: Healthcare (e) Blood pressure (f) Syanosis (g) Recovery from anesthesia (h) Nature of the operative wound. (i) Drainage sites and tubes (j) Patency of the intravenous line (k) Presence of catheters and tubes (i) Urinary catheter (ii) Nasogastric tube (l) Completeness of indoor papers and postoperative orders. (m) Special instruction, if any 4. When the patient is brought to the ward, the hot water bottles and bags are removed and he is placed on the bed. The tubes and catheters are connected appropriately. The intravenous infusion bag or bottle is hanged from the saline stand. 5. The patient is given semiprone position, which maintains his airway by preventing the following (a) Tongue falling back. (b) Aspiration of secretions (c) Aspiration or regurgitated stomach contents. 6. Moist oxygen is given by face mask or nasal catheter if the patient has undergone major surgery and the expansion power of his lungs is reduced so that he is hypoxic. 7. The patients temperature, pulse, and respiration are noted as soon as the patient is brought to the ward, because these parameters can change while the patient is being shifted out of the ward. If there is any change, it should reach the normal level in a short period. If it does not, something could be seriously wrong with the patient. These parameters are examined every half hour to see if pulse change. In cas e the patient bleeds internally or CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 116 10 5 Sector: Healthcare externally, the pulse becomes rapid, and after severe bleeding, the respiration becomes rapid due to hypoxia. 8. The patient is kept warm. However overheating is to be avoided. Since it can lead to perspiration, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. It can also cause vasodilatation and increase the risk of hemorrhage from the operated area. 9. Fluids like normal saline and Ringers lactate are given intravenously to make up for the loss during surgery and restore the fluid and electrolyte balance. Five per cent dextrose is given to supply calories. Over infusion of fluids is to be avoided because that can lead to pulmonary edema. 10 If intravenous fluids are to be infused over prolonged periods. Serum electrolyte levels are checke d periodically so as to maintain electrolyte balance. 11 The patient is allowed to sleep in a comfortable position when he is fully conscious. He is permitted to move in bed and from the second day get out of the bed, unless he has a serious problem. Early mo bilization reduces the risk of the following complications. (a) Deep vein thrombosis. (b) Pulmonary embolism (c) Hypostatic pneumonia. 12 Fowlers position is given when the patient has undergone major surgery. It achieves the following: (a) It permits deep breathing. (b) It relieves flatulence. (c) It permits gravity drainage of discharge 13`Some patients vomit during and after recovery from anesthesia. They are given sip of water and deep breathing exercises. If that does not relieve vomiting antiemetic drugs are used. 14 Flatulenc e is seen often after abdominal surgery. Flatulence causes severe abdominal pain. The patient becomes uncomfortable. Its incidence is reduced with early ambulation. Such patients are given antiflatulent drugs or a flatus tube is passed per rectum to remove the gas in the colon and rectum. CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 117 10 6 Sector: Healthcare 15 Pain is experienced during the first 1 to 2 days after the surgery. It does not permit the patient to sleep well at night. 16. Diet (a) After the patient has fully recovered from anesthesia and is found not to be vomiting and when his/her peristaltic sounds are normal, he/she is initially given water to drink. When he/she is found to tolerate that well, he is given liquids orally e.g. tea, coffee, coconut water, fruit juices, etc. (b) The next d ay he/she is given soft diet. (c) The following day he is given normal diet. Adequate quantities of vitamin C are ensured in the diet so that the operative wound heals well. 17 By the third day morning the patient will have received adequate diet orally and will pass stools. If he does not, he is given a simple enema. If the surgery has been done on the gastrointestinal tract, an enema only when asked for by the doctor treating the patient. 18 There is a risk of retention of urine postoperatively. It may be due to a ny of the following reasons, as shown in the following table. Cause Measure for correction Pain Analgesic drugs Lying down position Make the patient sit up with support for passing urine. Lack of privacy Put screens around the patients bed. Spasm of bladder neck Application of hot water bag to the lower abdomen. Sound of running water. Atony of bladder Carbachol 1 ml IM. 19 If all measures fail at relieving the retention of urine, the bladder is catheterized. Repeated episodes of retention of urine are managed by the use of a self retaining urinary catheter. 20 Deep breathing exercises are given to patients who have undergone abdominal surgery. CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 118 10 7 Sector: Healthcare 21 If the patient is unable to breathe on his own, he may require endotra cheal intubation or tracheostomy and ventilation using a mechanical ventilator. 22 The dressing on the wound is not changed unnecessarily so as to reduce the risk of wound infection. It is changed if it gets soaked by blood or discharge. In case of wound infe ction, the dressing is changed as frequently as required. 23 The sutures are removed after 7 days. If the wound has healed well. It is left open. Exercise 1. Visit a nearby hospital and observe the post surgery care given to patient.

As a healthcare worker you should develop the ability to identify the critical events in disaster and take necessary steps to notify the concerned authority or prevent the spread. You should also be able to understand the response to be made to personal, environmental and public safety as per the regulations and norms. Relevant Knowledge When hazards are met by vulnerabilities or pressures which are seen as rooted in socio -economic and political processes, a disaster occurs. A disaster results from the combination of hazard, vulnerability and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potential chances of risk. A disaster happens when a hazard impacts on a vulnerable population and causes damage, casualties and disruption. Any natural hazard such as flood, earthquake or cyclone which is a triggering event along with greater vulnerability would lead to disaster causing greater loss to life and property. Vulnerability includes inadequate access to resources, sick and old people, lack of awareness, lack of training, etc. Vulnerability and risk to disaster will depend on certain conditions, for example, an earthquake in an uninhabited desert cannot be considered a disaster, no matter how strong it is. The hilly regions, on the other hand, are vulnerable to various kinds of disasters such as avalanches, landslides, hailstorms or cloudbursts. Disaster Management covers a broad range of interventions before, during and after a disaster to prevent, minimize the loss of life and property and to accelerate recovery. The manner in which human beings deal with disasters improved as technology developed and our approach to risk assessment and mitigation measures became more and more scientific. Earlier, disaster management was reactionary and we could not prevent or mitigate the damage. But now we have developed pre-disaster mitigation measures to avoid or reduce the impact of disasters. Pre-disaster measures to prevent or mitigate disasters are called Risk Management. Goals of Disaster Management The goals of disaster management are to: 1. Reduce, or avoid, losses from hazards; 2. Assure prompt assistance to victims; and 3. Achieve rapid and effective recovery. The disaster management cycle illustrates the ongoing process by which governments, businesses, and civil Figure 1: Disaster Management Cycle 114 Session 1: Disaster Management and Emergency Response CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 123Sector: Healthcare society plan for and reduce the impact of disasters, react during and immediately following a disaster, and take steps to recover after a disaster has occurred. Appropriate actions at all points in the cycle lead to greater preparedness, better warnings, reduced vulnerability or the prevention of disasters during the next iteration. The complete disaster management cycle includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either modify the causes of disasters or mitigate their effects on people, property and infrastructure. The mitigation and preparedness phases occur as disaster management improvements are made in anticipation of a disaster event. As disaster occurs, key personnel in disaster management, especially humanitarian organisations, become involved in the immediate response and long-term recovery phases. Phases in Disaster Management The four disaster management phases are as follows: 1. Mitigation - It includes steps taken to minimise the effects of disaster. Examples include building codes, vulnerability analysis, zoning and land use management, preventive healthcare and public education. Let us look at some of these mitigation measures in detail. (a) Building codes: A building code or building control are a set of rules that specify the minimum acceptable level of safety for constructed objects such as buildings and non- building structures. The main purpose of building codes are to protect public health, safety and general welfare as they relate to the construction and occupancy of buildings and structures. Unless a building is being renovated, the building code usually does not apply to existing buildings. The building code becomes law of a particular jurisdiction when formally enacted by the appropriate authority. An example of a building code is an ancient building code that has come down from Biblical times, which specifies that a parapet must be made for the roof to prevent someone falling from it. Building Codes generally include l Rules regarding parking and traffic impact. l Fire code rules to ensure safe evacuation in the event of a fire. l Requirements for earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and tsunami resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large buildings where a failure in following the norms would be catastrophic. l Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of flammable substances, or housing a large number of people). l Energy provisions and consumption. l Specifications on components like size, windows, ventilations, basements, etc. l Allowable installation methodologies. 115 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 124Sector: Healthcare l Minimum and maximum room and exit sizes and location. l Ensuring exterior restrictions, such as setbacks. l Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work. l Anti-collision markers for high structures for the benefit of aircraft. (b) Vulnerability Analysis: Assessing vulnerabilities of a megacity are fundamental to enabling counteractive measures before an expected earthquake disaster as well as preparing for the post-earthquake response. An example of vulnerability analysis is of a remote sensing system set up to assess the vulnerability of a megacity and to assess the risk of a hazard turning into a disaster in that megacity. The data from the remote sensing provide information on population growth, housing in hazardous areas, etc. Substantial and up-to-date, area-wide data are the basis for effective crisis management. (c) Zoning and Land use Management: Zoning is a method of land use planning done by local governments. The word is derived from the practice of designating permitted uses of land based on mapped zones which separate one set of land uses from another. Zoning regulates land use, such as for residential, commercial, green belts, ecological protection areas, etc., or it may regulate building height, parking lot coverage, etc. The primary purpose of zoning is to segregate uses. To understand zoning think of how space is organized in a home. The different rooms of the house are situated in a way that it is both convenient and safe for people of the house. Water faucets, drains, electrical fittings are placed in the bathrooms in such a way that they can be hygienically and safely used. Space in the rooms are demarcated for sitting, sleeping, watching TV, etc. keeping in mind the movement as well as convenience and safety. Zonal regulations means zoning of land use and regulations prepared under the Town and Country Planning Act, prescribing the uses permissible in different land use zones, the open spaces around buildings, plot coverage, floor area ratio, height of the building, building lines, parking, etc. Mitigation will depend on the incorporation of appropriate measures in national and regional development planning. Its effectiveness will also depend on the availability of information on hazards, emergency risks, and the countermeasures to be taken. The mitigation phase, and indeed the whole disaster management cycle, includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either modify the causes of disasters or mitigate their effects on people, property, and infrastructure. 2. Preparedness: It involves planning to respond to disaster. It includes preparedness plans, emergency exercises or training, and warning systems. The goal of emergency preparedness programmes is to achieve a satisfactory level of readiness to respond to any emergency situation through programmes that 116 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 125Sector: Healthcare strengthen the technical and managerial capacity of governments, organizations, and communities. These measures can be described as logistical readiness to deal with disasters and can be enhanced by having response mechanisms and procedures, rehearsals, developing long-term and short -term strategies, public education and building early warning systems. Preparedness can also take the form of ensuring that strategic reserves of food, equipment, water, medicines and other essentials are maintained in cases of national or local catastrophes. During the preparedness phase, governments, organizations, and individuals develop plans to save lives, minimize disaster damage, and enhance disaster response operations. Preparedness measures include, (i) preparedness plans; (ii) emergency exercises/ training; (iii) warning systems; (iv) emergency communication systems; (v) evacuation plans and training; (vi) resource inventories; (vii) emergency personnel/ contact lists; (viii) mutual aid agreements; and (ix) public information and education. As with mitigation efforts, preparedness actions depend on the incorporation of appropriate measures in national and regional development plans. In addition, their effectiveness depends on the availability of information on hazards, emergency risks and the counter measures to be taken, and on the degree to which government agencies, non-governmental organizations and the general public are able to use the information. 3. Response: Response includes efforts to minimize the hazards created by a disaster. It includes search and rescue, and emergency relief. The aim of emergency response is to provide immediate assistance to maintain life, improve health and support the morale of the affected population. Such assistance may range from providing specific but limited aid, such as assisting refugees with transport, temporary shelter, and food to establishing semi - permanent settlement in camps and other locations. It may also involve initial repairs to damaged infrastructure. The focus in the response phase is on meeting the basic needs of the people until more permanent sustainable solutions can be found. 4. Recovery: Recovery includes measures taken to generate resource for returning the community to normal. These measures may include temporary housing, grants, and medical care. As the situation after a disaster is brought under control, steps are undertaken to enable the affected population of undertaking a number of activities aimed at restoring the infrastructure and other resources. There is no distinct point at which immediate relief changes translate into recovery and then into long-term sustainable development. It depends on the pace of recovery and recurrence of the disaster. There will be many opportunities during the recovery period to enhance prevention and increase preparedness, thus reducing vulnerability. Recovery measures, both short and long-term include returning vital life-support systems to minimum operating standards, temporary housing, public information, health and safety education, reconstruction, counseling programmes, and economic 117 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 126Sector: Healthcare impact studies. Information resources and services include data collection related to rebuilding, and documentation of lessons learned. Recovery activities continue until all systems return to normal or better. One of the major considerations of a disaster management plan is to reduce the vulnerability of a population to a risk or a hazard. This leads to plans for sustainable development. Measures of sustainable development include the promotion of sustainable livelihood and their protection and recovery during disasters and emergencies. Where this goal is achieved, people have a greater capacity to deal with disasters and their recovery is more rapid and long lasting. National Disaster Management Act, 2005 The Disaster Management Act 2005 defines disaster as \"a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence affecting any area, arising from natural or manmade causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature magnitude as beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area\". It defines disaster management as a continuous and integrated process of planning, organizing, coordinating and implementing measures which are necessary or expedient for (1) prevention of danger or threat of any disaster (2) mitigation or reduction of risk of any disaster or its severity or consequences (3) capacity building (4) preparedness to deal with any disaster (5) prompt response to any threatening disaster situation or disaster (6) accessing severity or magnitude of effects of any disaster (7) evacuation rescue and relief and (8) rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Disaster Management Act passed in 2005 provides for a detailed action plan right from the central government to the district and local levels to draw, implement and execute disaster management plans. The Act comprising 79 sections and 11 chapters is capable of effectively managing the disaster and matters related to it. According to the Act, \"Disaster Management\" is defined as a continuous and integrated process of planning, organizing, coordinating and implementing measures which are necessary or expedient to prevent danger or threat of any disaster, mitigation or reduce the risk or severity or consequences of any disaster, capacity -building and preparedness to deal with any disaster, prompt response to any threatening disaster situation or disaster, assessing the severity or magnitude of effects of any disaster, evacuation, rescue and relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Act empowers the Central Government to appoint the National Disaster Management Authority with the Prime Minister of India as the Chairperson and such number of other members, not exceeding nine. The other provisions in the Act include the establishment of National, State and District level disaster management Authorities, Institutes and Committees. Exercise 1.

Response and recovery 121 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 130Sector: Healthcare In this session, you will learn about the structure, roles and responsibilities of Emergency Response Team (ERT). It will help you to understand the equipment and procedures that are applied for rescue and search operations and the benefits of drills. It will also expose you to the understanding of the various safety threats and appropriate actions. Such understanding will keep you to function effectively in a team in case of mass casualty incidents. Relevant Knowledge Emergency Response Team (ERT) or Emergency Response Unit (ERU) is established to provide relief from suffering and distress to persons affected by hazards, emergencies and disasters. It is a team of trained technical specialists ready to be deployed at short notice. They use pre-packed sets of standardized equipment and materials to deal with the emergency. Structure, Roles and Responsibilities of an ERT The structure of an ERT is a functional team. In the United States of America (USA), the standard is a ten-person team comprising of the following: 1. ERT Team Leader: Generally, the first ERT team member arriving on the scene becomes team leader, and is the designated Incident Commander (IC) until the arrival of someone more competent. He/she makes the initial assessment of the scene and determines the appropriate course of action for team members; assumes role of Safety Officer until assigned to another team member; assigns team member roles if not already assigned; designates triage area, treatment area, morgue, and vehicle traffic routes; coordinates and directs team operations; determines logistical needs (water, food, medical supplies, transportation, equipment, and so on) and determines ways to meet those needs through team members or citizen volunteers on the scene; collects and writes reports on the operation and victims; and communicate and coordinates with the incident commander, local authorities, and other ERT team leaders. 2. Safety Officer: The Safety Officer checks team members prior to deployment to ensure that they are safe and equipped for the operation. He/she determines whether the working environment is safe or unsafe and ensures team accountability. He/she supervises operations (when possible) where team members and victims are at direct physical risk, and alerts team members when unsafe conditions arise. 3. Fire Suppression Team (2 people): The team suppress small fires in designated work areas and assist the search and rescue team or triage team. 4. Search and Rescue Team (2 people): The team search and provide for rescue of victims, as is prudent under the conditions and assist the Fire Suppression Team. 122 Session 2: Role and Responsibilities of Emergency Response Team CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 131Sector: Healthcare 5. Medical Triage Team (2 people): They provide Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) triage for victims found at the scene; marking victims with category of injury as per the standard operating procedures and assist the Fire Suppression Team or Rescue Team, if needed. The START system was developed to allow first responders to triage multiple victims in 30 seconds or less based on three primary observations: Respiration, Perfusion and Mental Status. 6. Medical Treatment Team (2 people): The team provides medical treatment to victims within the scope of their training. This task is normally accomplished in the Treatment Area; however, it may take place in the affected area as well. They may also assist the Fire Suppression Team and the Medical Triage Team as needed. The team members have to work under the supervision of the ERT team leader, and communicate with him/her. Because every ERT member in a community receives the same core instructions, all team members have the training necessary to assume any of these roles. Hasty teams may be formed by whichever members are responding at the time. Members may need to adjust team roles due to stress, fatigue, injury , or other circumstances. Equipment used by ERT The equipment used by an ERT could be sophisticated or simple, depending on the nature of the emergency and its magnitude. The list of some of the equipment used by the ERT is as follows: l Personal Protective Equipment (PPE include hard hats, protective apparel, masks, eye protection glasses, gloves, etc.). l HAZMAT (Hazardous Material Response Trucks). l Frac tanks (A frac tank is used to hold water, or a proppant, when a well is being fractured) l Vacuum trailers l Excavators l Bulldozers l Tri-axle Dump Trucks l Roll-Off Container Trucks l Air Cushion Recovery Tools l Mobile Incident Command Center with Satellite Communication Equipment l Utility Vehicle l Evacuation Megaphones l Emergency Rescue Mat l Emergency Eyewash and shower equipment CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 132123 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 133Sector: Healthcare l Fire Extinguishers l Medical Equipment l Flotation Devices l Safety Ropes Search and Rescue Operations Search and Rescue Operations (SAR) are a set of technical activities rendered by individual or a group of specially trained personnel who rescue and attend to the casualties under adverse conditions, where life is at threat. It is important for the rescuers to collect information on the extent of damage, approach to the damage and understand if any further damage is likely to occur. Search and Rescue Operations comprises the search for, and provision of aid to persons or structures which are feared to be in distress or imminent danger. It uses available personnel and facilities. It provides for their initial medical or other needs, and delivers them to a place of safety. Rescue is a team effort that needs planning and coordination amongst the members for an optimum response. The four types of search and rescue operations are as follows: (i) Mountain rescue refers to search and rescue activities that occur in a mountainous environment. The terrain in which mountain rescue often occurs has resulted in the development of a number of specific pieces of equipment and techniques. The equipment includes mountain bike, motorcycle, protective clothing, helmet, knives, tools, compass, and sleeping bags. Helicopters are often used to quickly extract casualties, and search dogs may be used to locate casualties or survivors. (ii) Ground search and rescue is the search for persons who are lost or in distress on land or inland waterways. Traditionally associated with wilderness zones, ground search and rescue services are increasingly required in urban and suburban areas to locate persons with Alzheimer's disease, autism, dementia, or other conditions that lead to wandering behaviour. (iii) Urban search and rescue also referred to as Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR), is the location and rescue of persons from collapsed buildings or other urban and industrial entrapment. Urban SAR (USAR) in many jurisdictions refers to the location and extraction of people from collapsed buildings or other entrapments. Some ground search teams also employ search and rescue dogs. Due to the specialized nature of the work, most teams are multi - disciplinary and include personnel from police, fire and emergency medical services. Unlike traditional ground search and rescue workers, most USAR responders also have basic training in structural collapse and the dangers associated with live electrical wires, broken natural gas lines and other hazards. While earthquakes have traditionally been the cause of USAR operations, terrorist attacks and extreme weather such as 124 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 134Sector: Healthcare tornadoes and hurricanes have also resulted in the deployment of these resources. (iv) Combat search and rescue is search and rescue operations that are carried out during war, that are within or near combat zones. The armed forces of the country plays a vital role during disaster emergencies, providing prompt relief to the victims even in the most inaccessible and remote areas of the country. With their skills in technical and human resource management they organize effective relief measures for emergency situations. (v) Air-sea rescue refers to the combined use of aircraft (such as flying boats, floatplanes, amphibious helicopters and non-amphibious helicopters equipped with hoists) and surface vessels to search for and recover survivors of aircraft downed at sea as well as sailors and passengers of sea vessels in distress. The rescue team should follow the following three key principles, while performing rescue operations: (a) Look physically for survivors and casualties trapped under the debris. (b) Listen to the source of information using acoustic devices. (c) Feel the gravity of danger and then respond to the situation. Rescue and Evacuation Drills A rescue and evacuation drill is a method or procedure of practicing the rescue or evacuation for an emergency. During any disaster, it is generally the security personnel or the police that first reaches the spot till the arrival of other emergency service personnel. The police extend all possible help and cooperation to the local authority in the rescue and evacuation operations. The security personnel should, therefore, be trained in rescue and search operations. In India, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has been designated as one of the agencies to respond in the case of a disaster striking any part of the country. The Government of India has also declared the National Industrial Security Academy (NISA) as a National level institution for imparting training to the rapid response units. In an evacuation generally the emergency system, usually an alarm is activated and the building is evacuated as though a real emergency has occurred. Usually the time it takes to evacuate is measured to ensure that it occurs within a reasonable length of time, and problems with the emergency system or evacuation procedures are identified to be remedied. At the village level, Disaster Management Committee (DMC) and Disaster Management Teams (DMTs) are set up. The DMC consists of electe d representatives, local authorities, officials from Government departments, doctors, paramedics, representatives from primary health centres, school teachers, etc. The DMT consists of the members of voluntary organizations/NGOs and trained volunteers from the village. The members of the team are imparted training in basic functions of rescue, evacuation, first aid, etc. 125 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 135Sector: Healthcare Drills are usually conducted in schools, offices, factories and other such facilities. The kinds of drills usually depend on the possible emergencies that could occur in those areas. The common types of drill that are usually conducted are: 1. Fire drills. 2. Drills on use of rescue equipment like ropes and knots, stretchers, fire extinguishers, and first aid kits. 3. Drills on use of flotation devices. 4. Drills on use of Personal Protection Equipment. Benefits of Drills l Drills help develop teamwork. l Drills help develop self confidence. l Drills help to prepare crew for responding rapidly and effectively in an emergency situation. l Drills can help prepare the crew to make decisions under pressure. l Drills can help to identify how procedures might be improved. l Drills help the crew to become familiar with the equipment and procedures and whether they are working properly.

Different types of search and rescue operations 128 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 138Sector: Healthcare In this session, you will learn about the classification and causes of fire. You will also study the procedure of dealing with fire emergencies, methods and techniques of extinguishing fire, fire fighting equipment and installation, fire prevention and protection and role of people in fire detection and control. The knowledge and skills acquired through this module will help you to assist in fire emergencies in hospital or other medical care units. Relevant Knowledge Everything in nature is made up of five basic elements: (i) earth, (ii) water, (iii) fire, (iv) air, and (v) space. Each of the five elements has a certain relationship with the other elements. These relationships form the laws of nature. An element could support or act as an enemy to the other element. For example, air (contains oxygen) support fire, but water can block the spread of fire. Therefore, in order to co-exist fire and water need to be separated. In this session, we will try to understand how to respond to fire emergencies. But before we do that, let us first understand what we mean by fire. Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light and various reaction products. The flame is the visible portion of the fire and consists of glowing hot gases. Fire has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. For a fire, three things are necessary - heat, oxygen and fuel. Fuel (in a non-gaseous state) does not burn directly. When you apply heat to fuel, it produces a gas. When the oxygen in the air combines with this gas, it burns. Remove one of those things (e.g., add water to eliminate heat or cover with dirt or sand to eliminate oxygen) and the fire will go out. Therefore the three elements that are necessary for a fire to ignite are: l Heat l Oxygen l Fuel l Fires start when a flammable and/or a combustible material, in combination with a sufficient quantity of oxygen gas is exposed to a source of heat that reaches above the Fig.1: Fire Tetrahedron flash point for the fuel and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the \"fire tetrahedron\" (See Figure 1). Classification of Fires Most fires that occur will fall into one or more of the following classes: 129 Session 3: Fighting Fire CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 139Sector: Healthcare Class A: It comprise of fires involving ordinary combustible materials, such as paper, wood, and textile fibers. Cooling, blanketing, or wetting extinguishing agents are used for extinguishing such fires. Class B: It comprise of fires involving flammable liquids such as gasoline, thinners, oil-based paints and greases. Extinguishers for this type of fire include carbon dioxide, dry chemical and halogenated agent types. Class C: It comprise of fires involving energized electrical equipment. The most common type of extinguisher for this class is carbon dioxide extinguisher. Class D: It comprise of fires involving combustible metals such as magnesium, sodium, potassium, titanium, and aluminum. Special dry powder extinguishing agents are required for this class of fire, and must be tailored to the specific hazardous material. Class K: It comprises fires involving commercial cooking appliances with vegetable oils, animal oils, or fats at high temperatures belong to the category of class K. Wet potassium acetate, which is a low pH- based extinguishing agent, is used for extinguishing this class of fire. Common Causes of Fire Common causes of fire can be related to the following: (i) Open Flames l Negligence in conducting hot work, such as welding, cutting or grinding. l Improper use of candles. l Improper handling of flammable or combustible liquids or flammable gases in or near-to- potential ignition sources. l Matches and cigarettes that are improperly l Disposed off or left unattended near combustibles. (ii) Electrical l Damaged electrical conductors, plug wires or extension cords. l Use of faulty, modified or unapproved electrical equipment. l Insufficient space or clearance between electrical heating equipment and combustibles. l Short or overloaded circuits. l Loose electrical connections. l Lighting. 130 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 140Sector: Healthcare (iii) Cooking l Deep frying in pots or pans on stove tops. l Unattended cooking appliances. l Combustibles located dangerously close to cooking equipment. (iv) Spontaneous Ignition l Improper disposal of materials susceptible to spontaneous combustion, such as oily rags from wood finishing or polishing. l Accumulation of organic materials, such as green hay, grain or woodchips. l Accumulation of waste combustible materials near potential sources of ignition. Dealing with Fire Emergencies In order to deal with fine emergencies remember the short form \"RACE\" i.e., Rescue, Alarm, Confine and Evacuate. Let us now learn about each of these aspects in detail. R - Rescue/Remove: Search and rescue is a team effort that needs planning, trained people and coordination amongst the members. When you discover a small fire you can rescue people in immediate danger, but this you should do without endangering your life. In case of big fires, evacuation should be done and people should calmly exit via safe Fire Exit. A - Alarm/Alert: Sound the alarm by pulling a fire box and call from a safe distance. Dial the fire emergency number 101. C - Confine/Contain: Close all doors, windows and other openings. E - Evacuate/Extinguish: Evacuate the building. In case it is necessary to enter the building, for example, to save people, take necessary precautions while entering the building. Methods and Techniques of Extinguishing Fire Small fires can be extinguished only if you are trained to use a fire extinguisher under the supervision of a trained fire fighting personnel. To stop a fire, one of the sides of the fire tetrahedron ought to be cut off. The various methods adopted for extinguishing a fire include the following: l COOLING: Lowering the temperature of the combustible material so that it falls below the ignition temperature. l SMOTHERING: Cutting off supply of air/oxygen to the combustible material. 131 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 141Sector: Healthcare l STARVING: Removing of combustible material or removing air for achieving conditions below the \"Limit of flammability\". Class of Fire Description Method of Extinguishing Extinguishing Medium Extinguisher to be Used A Fire involving ordinary combustible material such as textiles, wood, paper, jute, etc. Cooling Water Soda -Acid Type, Water, CO 2. B Fire involving flammable liquids such as petrol, oils, lubricants, solvents, paints, varnishes etc Smothering or Blanketin g effect Foam CO 2 Dry Chemical Powder (DCP) Foam CO 2, Dry Chemical Powder or Halon type. C Fire involving electrical installations due to overheating or short circuiting. This may finally lead to class A, B or C fire Switch off electrica l supply Vapourising liquids, dry powders and CO 2 CO 2, DCP or Halon, to be dry sand. D Fire involving metals such as radioactive metals Aluminum, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium and Zinc Smothering Suitable dry powder Special DCP extinguisher, dry earth, dry sand, powdered graphite, talc and asbestos, soda F Fire involving cooking oils and fats Smothering Powder BE Foam, wet chemical extinguisher, Powder BE Note: l Do not use water jet for class B, D and E Fires. l Do not use foam extinguishers for class A, C, D and E Fires. l For class \"E\" Fire, extinguishing medium must be non-conductor of electricity and also non-damaging to equipment. Fire Fighting Equipment and Installations 1. Personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to withstand water and high temperatures and hand tools used by fire fighters are as follows: (a) Bunker gear, including turnout jacket and pants 132 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 142Sector: Healthcare (b) Self-contained breathing apparatus. (c) Helmet, facemask and/or visor. (d) Safety boots, gloves (e) Alert safety system device. (f) Handheld radio or other communication devices. (g) Thermal Imaging Camera. (h) Gas Meter. (i) Flat and pick -head axe. (j) Halogen bar (k) Chain saws. 2. Fire Water Tanks: For dealing with large fires, the entire building is installed with a system with a network of pipeline, hydrant valves, sprinkler heads, etc. The system is always kept under desired pressure with the help of respective Jockey pumps operating automatically within a range of water pressure in the pipe line. In case some hydrant is opened or sprinkler system gets activated, the respective main hydrantump or sprinkler pump will start automatically at a pre-set pressure for supplying water in large quantity. For supplying water to the system, the following water tanks are generally placed: (a) 1 Tank at the terrace: 100 KL (Kilo Litre) (b) 2 Underground tanks: 285 KL each (c) 2 Raw water tanks: 170 KL each (d) 2 Domestic water tanks: 155 KL each (e) Soft water tanks: 305 KL 3. Pumps: a) Main Fire Pumps for hydrants: Capacity 4500 LPM (Litre Per Minute). b) Pump for Sprinkler System: Capacity 4500 LPM. c) Diesel Pump as stand by: Capacity 4500 LPM for hydrant and sprinkler system. d) 2 Jockey Pumps with the capacity of 180 LPM and e) 450 LPM each to maintain pressure in low, medium and high pressure system. 4. Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants are provided inside the building covering all the areas as per fire safety rules and regulations. Each hydrant box is equipped with a hose reel, two outlet valves for standard size hoses and a branch pipe. 133 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 143Sector: Healthcare 5. Yard Hydrants: These are provided around the building for attacking the fire from outside, with the help of single outlet valve and standard size Reinforce Rubber Lined (RRL) hoses. Rubber hoses are provided with instantaneous release type couplings at each end i.e. male coupling at one end and female coupling at the other end. (a) Use of Hose Reels in Hydrants (Rubber Hose Reel of length 35 metres): Open the fire hydrant cabinet door, tilt the hose reel outwards and start unrolling the rubber hose after opening 1 inch size hydrant valve. Open quick shut off valve on the nozzle of direct water jet at the base of fire. One person can operate the hose reel comfortably. For handling canvas hoses, 2 -3 persons are sufficient. (b) Use of RRL (Reinforced Rubber Lined) Hose (Length 15 mtr -02 in each hydrant box): Open the hydrant cabinet door, unroll the canvas hose, connect its male coupling end to hydrant valve and if required, connect additional hoses depending upon the distance between the seat of fire and hydrant box. Ensure that length of hose is not kinked. Connect water jet nozzle to female end of canvas hose and hold it firmly with both hands while keeping the hose pressed between the body and right arm. Throw of water can be adjusted by regulating the hydrant valve. Third person can assist in holding the pressurized hose or adjust length of hose or act as a messenger for regulating the hydrant valve. Drain hoses thoroughly before rolling and stowing. Do not open the hydrant valve abruptly as reactive force of water jet through nozzle may injure the person holding it. 6. Automatic Sprinkler System: A sprinkler system is an automatic fire detecting, alarm and extinguishing system that is constantly on guard to deal quickly and effectively with any outbreak of fire that may occur in relevant spaces. Water is fed to the sprinkler heads through a multi -stage composite pump applying water to low, medium and high pressure system of piping usually suspended from the ceiling with sprinklers facing upwards. Sprinklers system also helps for gaining an easy access to seat of fire and improvement of visibility by lowering the smoke level in areas on fire. In case of fire when temperature rises 68o C, the quartzoid bulb in the sprinkler head bursts and water under pressure starts spraying out from the sprinkler for extinguishing the fire by cooling effect. Most of the area in the shopping mall building is well protected against risk of fire by means of automatic sprinkler system. Various areas connected to low, medium and high pressure sprinkler system are further divided zone -wise and a visual and audible alarm indication will be activated on alarm panel situated in the mall control room. 7. Fire Detection Panel and Warning System: This panel is installed in the electric control room. In case of a fire in a particular zone, we get an indication and audible alarm signal for dealing with the emergency situation. Control panel operates on 24o C supply through a rectifier circuit connected to 230 V AC supply. 134 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 144Sector: Healthcare A stand by 24V battery backup is provided in case of failure of supply from the mains. Highly sensitive smoke and heat detectors are installed in various zones in public area, retail shops, service and machinery area on floors and corridors. Heat detectors: These detectors have thin strips of metal that react to the presence of heat and activate an alarm when a specific temperature is reached. The thin strips of metal warp easily when heat from the air comes into contact with them. When the metal warps to a sufficient degree, contact is made with an electrical circuit activating the alarm. Smoke detectors: When oxygen and the fuel source combine, the chemical reaction between the two products often produce other byproducts, including smoke and other toxic gases. A smoke detector works by monitoring the air for particles of smoke i.e., the minute particles produced by combustion. Smoke detectors do not detect flame, heat, or gases. There are two types of smoke detectors commonly in use: (i) Ionization Smoke Detectors, and (ii) Photoelectric Smoke Detectors Flame detector: These systems monitor the production of certain spectrums of light produced by fire. ome of these systems monitor infrared light while others monitor ultraviolet light produced by the fire. In case of fire, respective area fire detectors will activate an audible alarm signal along with visual indication showing the affected zone on a floor. A Light Emission Diode (LED) lamp glowing at the base of detector indicates that the detector has activated. The smoke detector is reset after the fire or after source of smoke is eliminated. Any fault indication also gets displayed on the panel. Manual call boxes, installed at specific points in the corridors, service, machinery and public area, covering the entire mall building are use to activate fire alarm. Fire alarm can be activated in the main fire control panel by breaking the glass of pill box with a small hammer fixed on it. For resetting the system, pill box glass has to be refixed. 8. Public Address System: The Public Address (PA) system panel is a part of main control panel. All areas are divided in zones for making necessary announcements or for giving FIRE ALERT alarm to various guest, service, machinery and public area. This system is supervised round the clock by an Assistant Security Officer (ASO). 9. Automatic Sprinkler Alarm Panel: This panel is installed adjoining main fire detection and warning panel. Zonal alarm signal and visual indication will get displayed on this panel in the event of water flow through the sprinklers, accidentally or due to outbreak of a fire. 10. Emergency Exits: Emergency exits on the road side outside the building are provided on every floor. Similarly, adequate arrangement is made for emergency exits from various public areas, basements, service areas and machinery areas. 135 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 145Sector: Healthcare 11. Signages: Evacuation and safety instructions are displayed conspicuously at different prominent places. The following signages are generally displayed: i. Photo luminescent signages reading \"IN CASE OF FIRE, USE STAIRS UNLESS INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE\" in red and white background in the entire building showing EXIT route. ii. Photo luminescent signages are fixed in \"EXIT\" staircase indicating floor number. iii. Each stairway and each elevator is given numbers as per evacuation plan e.g. S1, S2, etc. for stairways and L1, L2, etc. for elevators. iv. \"No Smoking signages are provided in service areas. v. Kitchen safety signages are fixed in all kitchens. vi. High Voltage/Danger signages are fixed on all electrical panels. 12. Emergency Power Supply: In case of power failure from the city source, generator sets each with a power output of 1500 KVA (or commensurate with requirements) come on load automatically within 5 to 10 seconds for meeting the normal supply load demand. Prevention and Procedures The defense against fire is viewed in two parts i.e., Fire Prevention and Fire Protection. (i) Fire Prevention: This is a major precaution, which embodies the control of the source of heat and elimination or isolation of obviously dangerous fuels. It is considered much more important than success in the fire fighting operations. Adhering to precaution saves not only consequential losses but also helps in maintaining continuity in operations. Some of the preventive measures which are to be followed strictly have been mentioned below: l Do not compromise on implementing norms and standards. l Develop No Smoking discipline. l Do not leave liquid fuel unattended. l Prevent unauthorized electrical connections and usage of unauthorized electrical apparatus. l Store all fuels / flammable stores in safe place. l Establish a fire preparedness plan which takes care of prevention, response, recovery and keep it updated periodically. l Designate an emergency coordinator and a team and assign responsibilities to employees to initiate the plan. l Keep your housekeeping up -to-date, preventing accumulation of garbage or waste materials. 136 CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 146Sector: Healthcare l Upgrade the facility to meet the required fire codes mentioned in National Building Code (NBC) of India. l Ensure a preventive maintenance programme for operational equipment and make sure that the equipment meets the specifications and standards. l Develop a mutual programme with neighbouring establishments for such emergencies.

The internet browsing, e -mail and social messaging made the exchange of information almost instantaneous. Travel, especially over long distances, has become faster and more afforda ble. The increase in options available has made it possible for us to do more in a day, but has also increased the pressure on our time.

If you leave on time, you may often decrease efficiency and productivity. The rewards will be the ability to control your workload, and more time to focus on the most important aspects of your activities.

Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally about what to do or what to believe. It includes the ability to do independent thinking. Critical thinking can be defined as the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generalized by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning or communication, as a guide to belief or action or argumen t. Being critical involves making judgments and evaluations. Making judgments can involve distinguishing between fact and opinion or evaluating the validity of information sources or the validity of particular theories and/ or their application to particu lar situations. These judgments need to be well grounded in research, wide reading, and consideration of all possible viewpoints. Critical thinking in this sense is based on a synthesis of a number of factors, and is not just uninformed personal opinion. Critical thinking means different things in different disciplines. If you are studying in an education discipline like GDA, for example, you will be thinking critically when you apply theory to a practical situation and then reflect on what happened as a r esult of the application of your knowledge in that situation. In a discipline which has a less obviously practical application, for example some humanities areas of study, you will be thinking critically when you compare and contrast theories with each oth er, or when you try to work out gaps or flaws in those theories. CBSE Study Material - XII - 2019 167 157 Sector: Healthcare Critical Thinking involves the following Critical thinking involves the following: Interpretation: Having the ability to understand the information you are being presented with and being able to communicate the meaning of that information to others. Analysis: Having the ability to connect pieces of information together in order to determine what the intended meaning of the information was meant to represent. Inference: Having the ability to u nderstand and recognize what elements you will need in order to determine an accurate conclusion or hypothesis from the information you have at your disposal. Evaluation: Being able to evaluate the credibility of statements or descriptions of a persons ex perience, judgment or opinion in order to measure the validity of the information being presented. Explanation: Having the ability to not only restate information, but add clarity and perspective to the information, so it can be fully understood by anyone you are sharing it with. Self-Regulation: Having the awareness of your own thinking abilities and the elements that you are using to find results. Analyzing tasks Identifying assumptions Analyzing and classifying Making comparisons Problem solving Questioning and challenging ideas Observing facts and comparing them to hypotheses and assumptions Judging the validity of the source and the worth of evidence Forming opinions / arguments Making connections between ideas, texts, theories, frameworks, disciplines Evaluating and weighing up Drawing inferences Making generalizations Exercise 1.
