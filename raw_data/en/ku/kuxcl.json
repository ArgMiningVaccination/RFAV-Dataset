Modern medicine is ideal if you have a broken leg or need surgery. When it comes to treating illness, though, it leaves a lot to be desired. The main reason for this is that so many clinicians treat an illness's symptoms, not the actual root cause of the illness. In many cases, they take a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine.
