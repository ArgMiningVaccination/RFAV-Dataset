The ever changing characteristics of the feet, toes and nails provide valuable clues to the inner struggles or inner resolve. As you observe the toes, you are invited to ask deep probing questions. One of the questions that always come up is, \"Do the toes change as the story changes?\" And the answer is, \"Absolutely!\" When reading the toes take into consideration all of the characteristics and shape. Flexible feet indicate a person who adapts easily and willing to the life's ups and downs. However, if the foot energy is too flexible, there could be a tendency toward being too easily manipulated. Rigid feet often belong to rigid people-harsh, strict, precise and inflexible. Look for the obvious! The angle of the toes on the earth reveals the person's innate shyness or outgoingness. Toes that point directly ahead suggest confidence and a forthright approach to life. The ideal angle for the toes is an upright, yet flexible position. When the toes become exhausted and weighted down, you can bet that the person is feeling that same way about their life. Significant past and present issues need to be acknowledged and reconciled to prevent permanent and long-term damage. The right-foot and left-foot toes do represent different aspects of one's story. For the far majority of people the right foot will store the past and how one is in the world. The left foot stores more of the internal or self representation - it contains the vital energy for the moral and spiritual growth and understanding. Another division could be that the right side is how one relates to the world and others and the left is more of relating to self and Spirit. Rarely are the right and left side stories the same.
