(score from 178 reviews) Real guests Real stays Real opinions How guest reviews work Each review score is between 1 and 10. To get the overall score, we add up all the review scores and divide that total by the number of review scores we received. Guests can also give separate subscores in crucial areas, such as location, cleanliness, staff, comfort, facilities, value, and free WiFi. Guests submit their subscores and their overall scores independently - there's no direct link between them. You can review an accommodation that you booked through our platform if you stayed there, or if you got to the property but didn't actually stay there. To edit a review you've already submitted, contact our Customer Service team. We have people and automated systems that specialize in detecting fake reviews submitted to our platform. If we find any, we delete them and, if necessary, take action against whoever is responsible. Anyone who spots something suspicious can always report it to our Customer Service team so that our fraud team can investigate. Ideally, we'd publish every review we get, positive and negative. However, we won't display any reviews that include or refer to (among other things): - Politically sensitive comments - Promotional content - Illegal activities - Personal or sensitive info (e.g. emails, phone numbers, credit card info) - Swear words, sexual references, hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, or references to violence - Spam and fake content - Animal cruelty - Impersonation (i.e. if the writer is claiming to be someone else) - Any violation of our review guidelines. To make sure reviews are relevant, we may only accept reviews that are submitted within 3 months of checking out. We may stop showing reviews once they're 36 months old, or if the accommodation has a change of ownership. An accommodation can reply to a review. When you see multiple reviews, the most recent ones will be at the top, subject to a few other factors (e.g. language, whether it's just a rating or contains comments as well, etc.). You can sort and/or filter them by time of year, review score, and more. Sometimes we show external review scores from other well-known travel websites, but make it clear when we do this. Guidelines and Standards for Reviews These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone. Contributions should be travel related. The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don't include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com's services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams. Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience. Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted. All content should be genuine and unique to the guest. Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated. Respect the privacy of others. Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details. The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses. By default, reviews are sorted based on the date of the review and on additional criteria to display the most relevant reviews, including but not limited to: your language, reviews with text, and non-anonymous reviews. Additional sorting options might be available (by type of traveler, by score, etc...). Translations disclaimer This service may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
