He wanted to get to the root cause of the issues instead of a quick fix. It was helped my life tremendously. Between the supplements, bio-identical hormone therapy, and getting my thyroid in balance, I have no more problems. I saw him for 6 months.\" Karen J. \"I was overweight, lethargic and falling into that middle-aged trap that I think a lot of Americans have fallen into today. After seeing what Dr. Pel\u00e1ez had done for my wife... I began to see him as well. I've lost about 35 lbs in a year. It's made all the difference in the world.
