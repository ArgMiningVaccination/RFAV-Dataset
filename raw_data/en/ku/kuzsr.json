The aim of this survey was to determine the use of CAM among patients with biopsy-proven sarcoma, GIST and desmoid tumors. Methods From Jan 1 to April 30th, a structured cross-sectional survey was conducted in outpatients in the sarcoma center. We used questionnaires validated in melanoma and breast cancer pts earlier. The chart explored sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related characteristics as well as the types and modes of CAM use. Results The questionnaire was filled out by 325 patients (59% sarcoma, 23% GIST, 18% desmoid). Their mean age was 53 years, 50% women, 47% men and 3% with no mention of gender. The results clearly indicate an interest in CAM, 35% have been interested for a long time in CAM methods and 44% since their tumor diagnosis. CAM usage was reported by 51% of sarcoma patients, of whom 12% used CAM just before the tumor disease, 24% are currently using naturopathic medicine, and 15% used CAM only during the tumor disease, but not currently. The main reasons for the interest in and use of CAM were: to boost the immune system (78%), to help them feel better (76%) and cope with cancer treatment (45%), and to reduce stress (53%), symptoms or side effects (36%). Less than 30% of patients reported taking vitamin and mineral supplementation, especially vitamin D. Compared to males, female patients are more likely to use CAM natural remedies or methods. Of those patients currently using CAM, there was a balance between users of herbal medicine (TCM) and homeopathic approaches at 32% each. Conclusions The use of CAM, particularly biologically based therapies is more likely to be used by older patients than younger patients. They describe this as an effective complement to conventional medicine but many patients report that they are not sufficiently informed about risks and benefits of CAM. They also are dissatisfied with the reimbursement of CAM costs by health insurances. The high proportions of patients using CAM that could interfere with oncological drugs via competitive pathways warrants more detailed investigations.
