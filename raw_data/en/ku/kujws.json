PRASANNA KUMAR, PH.D., : CIVIL ACTION : Plaintiff, : :: v. : :: TEMPLE UNIVERSITY CANCER CENTER : NO. 95-7832TEMPLE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE and SALICK HEALTH CARE, INC., Defendants. MEMORANDUM AND ORDER Yohn, J. August , 1997 Plaintiff, V.K. Prasanna Kumar, has filed this Title VII employment discrimination action against defendants SalickHealth Care, Inc. (\"Salick\"), Temple University Cancer Center andTemple University School of Medicine (collectively \"Temple\"), 1 on the basis that defendants unlawfully discriminated against himbecause of his national origin. Pending before the court areSalick and Temple's motions for summary judgment. For thefollowing reasons, defendants' motions will be DENIED.2I. STANDARD OF REVIEW Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is nogenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving partyis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P.56(c). Upon a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party,to prevail, must \"make a showing sufficient to establish theexistence of [every] element essential to that party's case, andon which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). In evaluating whether the non-moving party has established eachnecessary element, the court must grant all reasonable inferencesfrom the evidence to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574 (1986). \"Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a reasonable trier offact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issuefor trial.'\" Id. at 587. II. FACTS A. Relationship Among Temple, CCC & Salick Temple's Cancer Center is an outpatient facility which provides comprehensive diagnosis, treatment and other servicesrelated to cancer. The operation of the Cancer Center is governed3by a management agreement among Temple, Comprehensive Care Centers, Inc., (\"CCC\"), and Salick. (Management Agreement Among Temple, CCC & Salick , at 1-2, 39). Pursuant to the agreement, Temple owns the Cancer Center, but CCC manages and develops it asan independent contractor. (Management Agreement , at 1); (Scanlon Dep. at 4-5). CCC is responsible for the hiring and firing of allCancer Center personnel except medical staff, interns, residentsand fellows. (Management Agreement , at 15). Salick agreed to guarantee all of CCC's obligations under the agreement.(Management Agreement , at 2, 39). B. Kumar's Employment Relationship with Salick & Temple Kumar, who is of Indian national origin, is a physicist with a Ph.D., not an M.D. From September, 1992 to June, 1994, hewas employed as Chief Physicist of the Department of RadiationOncology at the Cancer Center. He was interviewed for the position of Chief Physicist by Dr. Scanlon, the Executive Director of the Cancer Center andVice-President of Salick's Mid-Atlantic Region, and Dr. PatrickThomas, a physician and Chairperson of the Department ofRadiation Oncology at Temple. (Thomas Dep. at 16-17). In an August 13, 1992 letter, Scanlon offered Kumar the position of Chief Physicist at the Cancer Center. The offerletter was written on stationary with \"Temple University4Comprehensive Cancer Center\" letterhead and was signed by Scanlon as a Salick Vice-President. (T-2). On the same date, Thomaswrote Kumar a letter offering him a faculty appointment in theDepartment of Radiation Oncology at Temple University School ofMedicine. It was written on stationary with \"Temple University-Temple University Hospital-Department of Radiation Oncology\"letterhead and was signed Thomas. (T-1). Scanlon's offer saidit was \"[b]ased on [Kumar's] conversation with Dr. Thomas\" (T-2);Thomas' offer was based on \"our discussion and Dr. Scanlon'soffer.\" (T-1). According to Scanlon's deposition, Kumar was to be hired as an exception to the general rule that all non-physicianswere to be hired by Salick and that all physicians were to behired by Temple. In this regard, Scanlon testified as follows: Q: Do you know what his title was or his degree? A: Ph.D. Q: Now, in that capacity he was employed by whom? A: The university. Q: And he was also a member of the faculty; is that correct?A: He had a title with the faculty, yes. Q: Was that on the same level as a physician . . .? A: No. It was an exception to our general policy. Q: Can you explain that exception? A: Dr. Thomas and Dr. Kumar asked that in therecruiting of a Chief Physicist that that person havefaculty privileges beyond the university faculty. Weagreed to do that and to reimburse the university forthat salary.5Q: Is the exception the fact that it will [sic] faculty or is it the exception that he's not a physician?A: The exception was that both the chairman of thedepartment and the candidate at that time requestedthat arrangement. Q: That a person be engaged by Temple for which engagement it would be funded by Salick?A: Correct. (Scanlon Dep. at 8-10). Kumar started work on September 28, 1992, pursuant to a contract ending June 30, 1993. Renewal of Kumar's contract was tobe based on 1) satisfactory performance as determined by theChairperson of the Department, 2) programmatic needs, and 3) theavailability of financial support. (T-3). On February 23, 1993,Kumar's contract was renewed through June, 1994. (T-3) (signed byMyers on Temple letterhead). Because Kumar's position involved the provision of medical care, he was supervised by Temple's medical staff. Inthis regard, Kumar's direct supervisor was Thomas. (Thomas Dep.at 28, 37). However, Salick supervised the technical, managerialand administrative aspects of Kumar's position. Kumar's requestsfor business travel, educational training, and equipment andtextbook purchases were handled by Salick. Moreover, since hisposition was funded by Salick, it determined Kumar's salary andraises. With regard to these issues, Kumar was supervised byScanlon. (Thomas Dep. at 37).6C. Kumar's Relationship with Scanlon During the course of Kumar's employment as Chief Physicist, Scanlon and Kumar had many disagreements. A constantsource of friction was Kumar's attendance at professionalmeetings and his compensation for business and professionalexpenditures. For example, in November, 1992, Kumar requested that he be sent to St. Louis to attend a \"CMS\" training conference. However, Scanlon rejected this request because he believed thatthere were people at the hospital who could adequately trainKumar. (K-7). In July, 1993, Kumar requested that he be allowed to attend the AAPM national convention in Washington, D.C., a yearlymeeting of physicists. This time, Scanlon rejected restrictions.\" Kumar because another physicist in thedepartment, who was not Indian, was allowed to attend similarconferences in New Orleans and in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. (S-7)(Kumar's handwritten notes). On a related note, Kumar quarreled with Scanlon over Scanlon's refusal to fund Kumar's membership in variousprofessional associations and to provide Kumar with his ownsecretary and computer. (T-28).2 John White was an employee of Salick. 7Kumar and Scanlon also disagreed about what administrative matters were to be handled without theintervention of Thomas and the medical staff. For example, inFebruary, 1993, Scanlon was upset with Kumar because Kumarinvited Thomas to attend an administrative meeting. In astrongly worded memo to Kumar, Scanlon stated: \"I was verydisappointed that you extended an invitation to Dr. Thomas to ameeting that I arranged for you and John White 2 . . . I don't expect that you would be so presumptuous to repeat thisperformance.\" (T-4). Kumar responded with a letter of his own inwhich he stated that he would invite Thomas to any wherehe also over salary and pay raises. In August, 1993, Scanlon authorized a pay raise of oneand one-half percent for Kumar. According to Kumar, this wasthree to four percent less than the raises received by other non-Indian physicists and technicians in the department. (T-19). Kumar registered his unhappiness about this matter in the August20, 1993 letter to Scanlon. (T-19). D. Kumar's Performance Problems According to the record, there were several problems8with Kumar's performance as Chief Physicist. Thomas testified that several members in Kumar's department complained to him thatKumar was a slow, indecisive and uninspiring leader and Thomashimself agreed. (Thomas Dep. at 18-20). He testified that Kumar\"was slow but competent and lacked confidence and lacked a lot ofpersonal skills.\" (Thomas Dep. at 25). Scanlon confirmed Thomas'testimony as to the complaints of other members of the departmentand Scanlon also testified that he believed that Kumar'sperformance as Chief Physicist was poor. (Scanlon Dep. at 22). E. Derogatory Comments Made by Scanlon to Kumar According to Kumar, Scanlon made five derogatory remarks to Kumar during the course of Kumar's employment as ChiefPhysicist. The first remark came in October, 1992 and involvedthe department's linear accelerator machine. When Kumar advisedScanlon that the machine was broken, Scanlon allegedly askedKumar if it was \"beneath him, beneath his Indian dignity to go onhis hands and knees [] under the machine in order to see theproblem.\" (Kumar Dep. at 39). The second remark occurred when Kumar asked Scanlon if he could attend the conference in St. Louis. During theconversation, Scanlon allegedly said to Kumar, \"What do you havein that Indian brain of yours?\" (Kumar Dep. at 43). The third derogatory remark occurred at the February,91993 meeting attended by Kumar, Scanlon, White and Thomas. After Scanlon ordered everyone except Kumar to leave his to Kumar, \"You Indian.\" (Kumar Dep. at52). The fourth incident, which occurred around November, 1993, again involved the linear accelerator. However, it did notinvolve a direct comment to Kumar. Instead, according to Kumar,Thomas relayed to Kumar that Scanlon had said to Thomas, \"thatlousy Indian has screwed up the machine.\" (Kumar Dep. at 55). The fifth derogatory remark occurred at or about the time Kumar's position at Temple was terminated. According toKumar, when Kumar approached Scanlon to discuss Salick's refusalto fund his position of Chief Physicist, Kumar was told byScanlon to \"take his Hindu ass out of here.\" (Kumar Dep. at 56). F. Kumar's Complaints According to the record, Kumar often complained to Thomas about Scanlon's refusal to pay for Kumar's membership inprofessional societies, his refusal to sponsor Kumar's trip toWashington, D.C. for the AAPM conference, and his failure toprovide Kumar with an office the discriminatory conduct, Kumar claims that he complained to Thomas on several occasions. (Kumar Dep. at T-28). reviewing this evidence in the light mostfavorable to Kumar, the court can point to only three incidentswhere Thomas may have been notified of Scanlon's national origin discrimination. The first involved Scanlon's second derogatory remark. Although he did not tell Thomas the exact words involved, (\"Whatdo you have in that Indian brain of yours?\") (Kumar Dep. At 43),Kumar stated that he complained to Thomas that Scanlon \"does notallow me to go to St. Louis, that he was very demeaning and heinsulted me and my national origin.\" (Kumar Dep. at 43). Thomasstated that as a result of this incident he would attend allfuture meetings between Kumar and Scanlon and Kumar testifiedthat remedial action. (Kumar Dep. at45-46, 153-156). The second incident occurred in August, 1993, when Kumar wrote a letter to Scanlon in which he complained of theamount of his salary increase, his lack of authority over otherdepartment employees and his not receiving a secretary andcomputer. The last word in the letter calls Scanlon's treatmentof him \"discriminatory.\" It was copied to Dr. Macdonald, theMedical Director, Thomas, Dr. Myers, the Dean of the MedicalSchool, and Dr. Malmud, the Vice-President of the Health SciencesCenter. (T-19).3At two other parts of his deposition, Kumar mentioned telling Thomas about Scanlon's conduct. However, that testimony appears to be just a summary of the three communications betweenKumar and Thomas discussed here. (Kumar Dep. at 148, 156). 11The third incident occurred in November, 1993. In response to Scanlon's alleged comment to Thomas that the \"lousyIndian has screwed up\" the linear accelerator machine, Kumar toldThomas that Scanlon had made other demeaning remarks about hisnational origin in the past. (Kumar Dep. At 55, 58). He alsowrote to Thomas: \"I was appalled to hear that Bob Scanlon statedthat 'that I have been screwing up the Varian linearaccelerator'! It is so outlandish a remark that I feel that Ishould confront him to offer proof or refrain from making suchirresponsible remarks.\" (T-22)(Kumar Dep. 55, 58). The letterdid not make mention of the \"lousy Indian\" comment. 3 G. Kumar's Termination In December, 1993, Scanlon wrote a letter to Kumar stating the following: Please accept my personal thanks for all your help in 1993. Your efforts are very much appreciated in theCenter's continued service to our patients. . . . I fully recognize that our achievements as a companyare a direct result of the energy and efforts of eachand every employee. You have been and are essential tothe company's success. (T-25).12Nevertheless, in February, 1994, in a letter to Thomas Freitag, the Associate Dean for Administration, Scanlon statedthat Salick no longer believed it appropriate to continue tosupport Kumar as Chief Physicist. As reasons for its withdrawalof funding, Scanlon listed Kumar's lack of demonstratedleadership and judgment, Kumar's inability to develop confidencein the staff, Salick's knowledge that Kumar was actively seekingother employment in early 1994, and \"the general unhappiness andlack of loyalty with Salick Health Care, Inc.\" (T-31). In February, 1994, over the initial objections of Thomas who favored Kumar's reappointment, (Thomas Dep. at 85),Kumar was denied reappointment as Chief of Physics. Myers, theDean and Associate Vice President for the Health Sciences Center,wrote Kumar as follows: This letter shall confirm that Dr. Patrick Thomas met with you on January 25, 1994 and advised you thatSalick Health Care, Inc. will withdraw funding for yourposition effective July 1, 1994. No grant money orother funding sources have been identified to supportyour position. As a result, Dr. Thomas advised youthat the University has no choice but to withdraw itsoffer of reappointment made by letter dated January 6,1994. Your signed acceptance of that letter, received by the Office of Faculty and Student Records on February 9,1994 via inter-office mail, is ineffective in light ofits earlier rescission. As stated in the reappointment letter, the offer of reappointment was made with the expectation ofcontinued financial support. I regret the most recentchange in circumstance.4 Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to \"discharge an individual, or otherwise to discriminate against anindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions orprivileges of employment, because of such individual's race,color, religion, sex or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. PHRA prohibits employers from discriminating inemployment practices \"because of race, color, religious creed,ancestry, age, sex, national origin withdrawing Temple's offer of re- appointment was written on stationary with \"Temple University-School of Medicine-Office of the Dean\" letterhead. (T-32). Signed only by Myers, it was copied to Thomas. (T-32). Kumar was replaced as Chief Physicist by Dr. Lee Myers, a Caucasian. Myers' employment arrangement was not the same asKumar's; Myers was hired directly by Salick which paid himdirectly. (Thomas Dep. at 30). On December 18, 1995, Kumar filed suit against Salick Health Care, Inc., Temple University Cancer Center, and TempleUniversity School of Medicine claiming that during his employmenthe was discriminated against on the basis of his national origin,Indian, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964and 1991 (\"Title VII\"), as amended, Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq., and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\"), 43 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. \u00a7, et seq.4After completing discovery,5The state act is construed in the same manner as Title VII. See Chmill v. City of Pittsburgh , 412 A. 2d 860, 871 (Pa. 1980); Kryeski v. Schott Glass Technologies, Inc. , 626 A. 2d 595, 598 (Pa. Super. 1993). 14defendants filed their respective motions for summary judgment. III. DISCUSSION A. Salick's Motion for Summary Judgment Salick first argues that summary judgment is appropriate because the evidence fails to show that Kumar was an\"employee\" of Salick for purposes of Title VII and thePennsylvania Human Relations Act. 5 Title VII prohibits employers from discharging an employee because of that employee's national origin. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (a) (1). Because the protection of Title VIIextends only to those who are \"employees\" and does not extend to\"independent contractors,\" it is the plaintiff's burden to provethe existence of an employment relationship. See EEOC v. Zippo Manufacturing Co. , 713 F. 2d 32, 25 (3d Cir. 1983). In examining whether an employer-employee relationship exists, courts generally apply either the \"common law agency\"test or the \"hybrid\" test. The factors to be applied under thecommon law agency test include inter alia : 1) the hiring party's right to control the means and manner of the worker's15performance; 2) the skills required; 3) the source of the instrumentalities and tools; 4) the location of the work; 5) theduration of the relationship between the parties; 6) the extentof the hired party's discretion over when and how long to work;7) the method of payment; 8) the hired party's role in hiring andpaying assistants; 9) the provision of employee benefits; and 10)the tax treatment of the hired party. See, e.g. Walker v. Correctional Medical Systems , 886 F. Supp. 515, 520 (W.D. Pa. 1995) (citing Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Darden , 503 U.S. 318 (1992) (applying the agency analysis in an ERISA action)). Under the common law agency test, the most important factor isthe hiring party's right to control the manner and means by whichthe work is accomplished. See id. The factors to be applied under the hybrid test include inter alia : 1) the extent of the employer's right to control the means and manner of the worker's performance; 2) the kind ofoccupation, with reference to whether the work usually is doneunder the direction of a supervisor or is done by a specialistwithout supervision; 3) the skill required in a particularoccupation; 4) whether the \"employer\" furnishes the equipmentused and the place of work; 5) the length of time during whichthe individual has worked; 6) the method of payment; 7) themanner in which the work relationship is terminated; 8) whetherthe worker accumulates annual leave and retirement benefits; 9)6 Notwithstanding their differing names, the elements of the tests are so similar that it is unlikely to make adifference which test the court uses. Both tests consider thehiring party's right to control the manner and the means by whichwork is accomplished and a nonexhaustive list of factors as partof a flexible test of the \"totality of the circumstances.\" Cox v. Master Lock Co. , 815 F. Supp. 844, 845-46 (E.D. Pa.), aff'd , 14 F. 3d 46 (3d Cir. 1993); Walker , 886 F. Supp. at 521 (concluding that there is little discernible difference betweenthe hybrid test and the common law agency test); Stouch v. Brothers of the Order of Hermits Pa. 1993)(same). 16whether the worker is an integral party of the business of the employer; and 10) the intention of the parties. See E.E.O.C. v. Zippo Mfg. Co. , 713 F. 2d 32, 37 (3d Cir. 1983). Whichever test the court utilizes,6 a question of fact clearly remains as to whether an employer-employee relationshipexisted between Salick and Kumar. Kumar has Salick (through Scanlon) played a significant rolein interviewing and offering employment to Kumar, in providingKumar with office staff and equipment, in determining his payraises and compensation for business expenses (i.e., attendanceat professional meetings and membership in professionalassociations), and in the termination of Kumar's position asChief Physicist at the Cancer Center. Thus, there is sufficientevidence for a jury to conclude that Kumar was Salick's employee.Salick's motion for summary judgment on this issue therefore willbe denied. Salick next argues that even assuming the existence of17an employer-employee relationship, Kumar fails to state a claim of national origin discrimination under Title VII. In Title VIIcases, the court must follow the evidentiary framework first setforth by the Supreme Court in McDonnel Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973), and subsequently refined in Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 248 (1981), and St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks , 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2748 (1993). Under this framework, plaintiff first must establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. This may be done byshowing 1) that he belongs to a protected class; 2) that he wasqualified for the position in question; 3) that he wasdischarged; and 4) that the position was ultimately filled by aperson not of the protected class. See, e.g. Waldron v. SL Industries , 56 F. 3d 491, 494 (3d Cir. 1995) (citing McDonnel Douglas and Burdine ). If the plaintiff succeeds in carrying this burden, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to \"articulate somelegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\" for the employee'sdischarge. McDonnel Douglas , 411 U.S. at 802. The employer satisfies its burden of production by introducing evidence which,taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was anondiscriminatory reason for the unfavorable employment decision.See Hicks , 113 S.Ct. at 2748; Fuentes v. Perskie , 32 F. 3d 759,7Plaintiff should present evidence that helps establish \"such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies,incoherences, or contradictions in the employer's profferedlegitimate reason[] for its action that a reasonable fact findercould rationally find [it] 'unworthy of credence.'\" Fuentes , 32 F. 3d at 765. 8 To the extent Salick argues that Kumar's record of poor performance makes him unable to be \"qualified\" for purposesof the second element of his prima facie case, that argumentfails. The Third Circuit has stated that a plaintiff need not 18763 (3d Cir. 194) (\"The employer need not prove that the tendered reason actually motivated its behavior as throughout this burden-shifting paradigm the ultimate burden of proving intentionaldiscrimination always rests with the plaintiff.\"). To defeat summary judgment when the defendant answers the plaintiff's prima facie case with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action, the plaintiff must point tosome evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a fact findercould reasonably either 1) disbelieve the employer's articulatedreason; 7 or 2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause ofthe employer's action. See Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont Nemours and Co. , 100 F. 3d 1061, 1067 (3d 1996), , 117 S. 2532 (1997); Fuentes , 32 F. 3d at 764. With regard to his prima facie case, Kumar satisfactorily meets his burden. He is a member of a protectedclass, he was qualified for the position, he was discharged, andhe was replaced by a person not in the protected class. 8disprove poor performance in order to succeed at the first level of proof, \"but rather it is more logically a defense that israised at the second level to meet the plaintiff's A.T.& T., 794 F. 2d 860, 863-64 (3d Cir. 1986) (insubordination, poor performance, and misconductasserted at the second level as legitimate reasons for employeedischarge). 19In response to Kumar's prima facie case, Salick proffers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Kumar'sdischarge, namely that he performed the job as Chief Physicistpoorly. In this regard, Salick presents evidence showing thatKumar had several on-going disputes with Scanlon, haddifficulties with his co-workers, lacked interpersonal skills andleadership qualities, and was generally ineffective as a ChiefPhysicist. (Thomas Dep. at 18-26);(Scanlon Dep. at 22). In response to Salick's proffer, however, Kumar presents sufficient evidence that Salick's reason is pretextual. Crucial in this regard is evidence of discriminatory conduct bySalick's chief decision-maker, Scanlon, namely the derogatoryremarks allegedly made by him during Kumar's employment andtermination, and evidence of his differing treatment of Kumar andnon-Indian employees with regard to business-related travel,membership in professional associations and pay raises. See Fuentes , 32 F. 3d at 764 (To survive a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff must point to some evidence, either direct orcircumstantial, which would permit a fact finder to believe that9 Hostile environment harassment because of national origin and unlawful discharge because of national origin areseparate and distinct violations under Title VII. Kumar does notmake any claim that Temple discriminatorily discharged him(either directly or indirectly through Salick) because of hisnational origin. Instead, in his Memorandum in Opposition toTemple's Motion for Summary Judgment, Kumar states that he is\"only pursuing a hostile environment claim against Temple.\" See 20discrimination was, more likely than not, a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action.). Also important here is evidence that Thomas believed that despite some problems, Kumar should have been reappointed asChief Physicist, (Thomas Dep. at 85), and that one month beforehis termination Scanlon sent a letter to Kumar praising hisefforts. (December 28, 1993 Letter from Scanlon to Kumar). Thisevidence would permit a fact finder to \"reasonably disbelieve\"Salick's articulated reason. Fuentes , 32 F. 3d at 764. Thus, Kumar has created a triable issue of fact as to whether Salick'sproffered non-discriminatory reason is pretextual and thereforeSalick's motion for summary judgment will be denied. B. Temple University's Motion for Summary Judgment Kumar's sole assertion against Temple is that the University failed to take proper remedial action when it foundout about Scanlon's discriminatory conduct and therefore Templeis liable to Kumar for hostile environment harassment under TitleVII. 9Pl's Memo. at p. 1. 21Although most hostile environment harassment cases are sexual harassment cases, not all are; they can be based onnational origin discrimination. See Harris v. Forklift System , 114 S. Ct. 367, 371 (1993) (adopting a harassment definition thatbroadly encompasses discrimination based on \"race, gender,religion, or national origin). In making out a hostileenvironment harassment case, a plaintiff must establish \"by thetotality of the circumstances, the existence of a hostile orabusive working environment which is severe enough to affect thepsychological stability of the minority employee.\" Knabe v. Boury Corp. , 114 F. 3d 407, 410 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Andrews v. City of Philadelphia , 895 F. 2d 1469, 1482 (3d Cir. 1990)). \"Even if a work environment is found to be hostile, a plaintiff must alsoshow that the conduct creating the hostile work environmentshould be imputed to the employer.\" Knabe , 114 F. 3d at 410. In Andrews , the Third Circuit set forth five factors a plaintiff must establish to bring a successful hostile workenvironment claim against an employer: 1) the employee sufferedintentional discrimination because of his national origin; 2) thediscrimination was pervasive and regular; 3) the discriminationdetrimentally affected the plaintiff; 4) the discrimination woulddetrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same national10 In Knabe , the Third Circuit recapitulated the various bases for employer liability: \"We made clear in Bouton that the liability of an employer is not automatic even if the [] hostilework environment is created by a supervisory employee. Werecognized three potential bases in the Restatement (Second) of Agency for holding employers liable for harassment committed by their employees. First, under \u00a7 219(1), employers are liable fortorts committed by employees their own negligence or recklessness: inthis context, an employer is liable for 'negligent failure todiscipline or fire, or failure to take remedial uponnotice of harassment.' [Third], under \u00a7 219(2)(d), if the harassing employee 'relied upon apparent authorityor was aided by the agency relationship.'\" Knabe v. Boury Corp. , 114 F. 3d 407, 411 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Bouton v. BMW , 29 F. 3d 103, 106 (3d Cir. 1994)). The latter two are \"more appropriate ina []hostile work environment case.\" Id. 22origin in the same position; and 5) the existence of respondeat superior liability. See Andrews , 895 F. 2d at 1492. With regard to the fifth element, the court is required to look to agency principles. See Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson , 477 U.S. 57, 66 (1986) (rejecting the idea of strict liability for employers in harassment cases and holding thatcourts should look to agency principles for guidance). Thus,Title VII liability may be imposed on the employer on a varietyof bases. An employer can be found liable if it was aware orshould have been aware of the harassment and failed to takeprompt remedial action, under the rationale that by failing totake such action the employer has contributed to the hostile workenvironment. See Knabe , 114 F. 3d at 411;10Bouton v. BMW , 29 F. 3d 103, 106 (3d Cir. 1994); Andrews , 895 F. 2d at 1486. 11 Although Temple alleges that only it employed Kumar, Kumar alleges that both Salick and Temple employed him. 23Similarly, the Third Circuit has stated that \"prompt and effective action by the employer will relieve it of liability ina hostile work environment claim.\" Bouton , 29 F. 3d at 107. In the present case, there is support in the record to suggest there is an issue of material fact as to all fiveelements. Important in this regard is the fact that a reasonablejury could conclude that Temple and Salick were Kumar's jointemployer. 11 This employment relationship is evidenced by the fact that in August, 1992, Temple and Salick jointly offered Kumaremployment (T-1, T-2); in February, 1993, Temple offered Kumarre-appointment through June, 1994, (T-3)(signed by Myers onTemple University letterhead); in January, 1994, Temple offeredre-appointment through June, 1995 (T-26) (signed by Myers onTemple University letterhead); and in February, 1994, Templewithdrew its re-appointment offer because Salick cut off funding.(T-31, T-32). Also important in this regard is evidence that Temple knew or should have known about the existence of harassment andfailed to take sufficient steps to remedy it. Although thisevidence is weak, it is sufficient for purposes of Temple'smotion for summary judgment. As discussed above, Kumar points tothree incidents where Thomas (and therefore Temple) was put on24notice of Scanlon's discrimination. The first involved Kumar's telling Thomas that Scanlon insulted his national origin anddemeaned him after Kumar asked to attend a conference in St.Louis. (Kumar Dep. at 42-49). However, according to Kumar'stestimony, Thomas sufficiently remediated the situation bypromising to attend all future meetings between Kumar andScanlon. (Kumar Dep. at 153). The second incident involved theAugust 20, 1993 letter sent by Kumar to Scanlon, and copied toThomas and other Temple officials, in which Kumar stated thatScanlon's actions were \"discriminatory.\" However, there is noindication that Scanlon's actions were discriminatory against himbecause of his national origin and the allegation in the letteris simply too general and vague to support a claim that Templeknew of Scanlon's discrimination against him because of hisnational origin.(T-19). The third incident related to Scanlon'salleged comment to Thomas \"the lousy Indian has screwed up themachine.\" (Kumar Dep. at 55). Kumar alleges that after Thomastold him of Scanlon's remark, he told Thomas that Scanlon hadmade other demeaning remarks about his national origin in thepast.(Kumar Dep. at 55, 58). Moreover, on November 30, 1993,Kumar sent a letter to Thomas complaining about Scanlon'streatment, although the letter did not mention any discriminatoryremarks whatsoever. (T-22). The first two incidents would not have, in and of25themselves, constituted sufficient knowledge on the part of Temple. However, the third incident does, although perhaps justbarely, particularly when occurring in the context of the firsttwo incidents. Taken together, therefore, these communicationsare sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to Temple'sawareness of Scanlon's discrimination. Thus, Temple's motionwill be denied. An appropriate order follows.26IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA V.K.
