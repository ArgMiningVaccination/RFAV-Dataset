Many times patients can only afford to come in 1 to 2 times a week for acupuncture, but they can take their Herbal Formula 3 times per day, hence getting a more regular therapeutic effect. In Asia, patients would come in 4 to 5 times per week for acupuncture, but in the US due to cost, lack of understanding of the patient, poor or inadequate insurance coverage, and work schedule interference with seeking appropriate regular care. The acupuncture points have very specific biochemical effects on the organs or viscera like the Liver, Kidney, Heart, Lungs, Spleen, etc. I am available for video telemedicine appointments and I can complete a diagnosis for you based upon ALL your symptoms, and then send you Prescription Herbal Formula. Contact me either by text, email, or phone and I can schedule you on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Generally speaking, acupressure is MUCH less effective than acupuncture since the biochemical reactions occur when the needles penetrate the skin. The needles are tiny and can almost not be felt at all. Americans in general tend to have an irrational fear of acupuncture needles due to the HUGE (100X larger and hollow) needles that are used in Western medicine for blood draws and injections.

Chronic pain exists due to a problem in the patient's nervous system. A delta nerve fibers are responsible for sharp burning pain. C nerve fibers are responsible for dull pain. In order to feel pain, 2 nerves are involved, the sensory pain nerves (nociceptor fibers: the A delta and C nerve fibers) and the proprioceptive. The sensory pain nerves send signals to L5, then up the spine, track of Lissaur, the same type of nociceptor nerve). So, there is a nerve signal to the midbrain to tell the brain to register the pain. Proprioceptive fibers are also firing continuously at the affected area. 20 m/second is how fast this conduction all this nerve travels. This signal travels up the spine to the midbrain, which tells the brain the location of the pain. To feel pain, signals from both the nociceptor and proprioceptor nerves are required. As a result of the signals from these nerves, the midbrain then releases endorphins, enkaphlins, and other pain-modulating substances to fill the pain receptor sites along the spine and at the location of the patient's pain. So, pain relief occurs as the nerve cannot signal the brain anymore to tell it it has pain because the pain receptors are filled with the enkaphlins and other pain-modulating substances. Patients with chronic pain have weak neurological proprioceptive signals. The midbrain is not receiving a strong proprioceptive signal. How do Acupuncture Needles function when they are placed distally to the site of pain?: The Distal acupuncture needles increase and stimulate the proprioceptive signal to the midbrain. By increasing the signal strength over a certain threshold level, acupuncture encourages the midbrain to instantly release the body's internal pain relieving substances. When the patients return home, within a few hours, the signals become weak again. The next day, the signal should be stimulated again with acupuncture. The acupuncture continues stimulating the nerve signals above the threshold level until the body \"remembers\" and reestablishes the normal threshold to signal the brain. There exists a relationship between the distal location of the needles and the location of the pain that is necessary to stimulate the nerve signals. Neurological Explanation of Acupuncture for Local needles: Mast cells located in the tissue, often found sequestered with fine blood vessels and intimately associated with nerve endings at the needle insertion site, are the primary proinflammatory agents that respond to tissue damage. (Kendall, 2002) When the acupuncture needle is inserted into the skin, it bumps against mast cells, and they burst and release leukotrins (much stronger that histamines) and prostaglandins causes the sensory and proprioceptive nerves to fire. Leukotrins are powerful anti-inflammatory substances in the body that encourage vasodilation, and stimulate white blood cells (WBC) to assist with the inflammation. With local insertion of acupuncture needles, the healing of the injury occurs directly where the needles are placed. This process creates micro-inflammation at the site of the injury (site of the older inflammation from the brain's perspective), and the micro-inflammation encourages healing in the local area due to the release of chemicals, and stimulation of the immune system. How does acupuncture stimulate increased blood flow to the affected area?: The brain vasoconstricts the area where pain exists. Why? Because the brain makes the assumption that the injury needles to be isolated to assist with the healing for a variety of reasons. So, the brain reduces the supply of blood to that area in order to prevent it from spreading it to the other areas. So, in order to protect other parts of the body, generally speaking, it causes vasoconstriction. Until the pain is stopped, the brain typically will not vasodilate the area. So, we need to stop the pain first in order for the healing to begin.
