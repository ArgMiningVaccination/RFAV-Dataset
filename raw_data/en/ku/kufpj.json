Natural foods that are free from added hormones, antibiotics, artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives and those that are minimally processed offer optimal nutrition and are the foundation for a healthy diet. But the importance of opting for \"natural\" ingredients goes beyond food. The use of vitamins, herbs, and dietary supplements can help improve your health and well-being. Choosing supplements made from natural ingredients and contain no artificial binders, fillers or synthetic chemicals is an important component of a healthy, natural lifestyle. To help you adopt a natural lifestyle, we suggest that you always prefer: - Minimally processed grains and grain products: choose pasta, breads and flours that are not bleached or bromated, and use whole grains when possible. - Prepared foods that are free of artificial sweeteners, flavors, additives, colorings, and have minimal or no synthetic preservatives. - Eco-friendly cleaning and personal care products for the household. - Natural bulk foods, which help protect the environment by reducing packaging and allow you to purchase the amount you want while saving on unnecessary packaging and marketing costs. - Organic foods, which are the most natural foods as they are grown without the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers etc., and are produced in a sustainable manner.
