The template is available in: Promising Practices are strategies, approaches, or programs that have anecdotally shown to have a positive impact in some local settings, however, there is not yet enough research-based evidence to certify as a best practice. Pop-Up Vaccination Events at Community Clinics Offering vaccinations through pop-up events at community clinics already familiar to refugee, immigrant, and migrant (RIM) communities is a promising practice to support equitable and efficient vaccine distribution. Multiple Touchpoints to Support Vaccine Uptake Using multiple touch points in vaccine outreach through reminder systems, such as phone calls, letters, and text messages, can significantly increase vaccine uptake. Several studies have demonstrated the positive impact of these reminder systems on vaccination rates. To keep RIM communities safe, it is vitally important to convey information about COVID-19 vaccines that is not only timely, accurate and accessible but addresses potential barriers. Working Toward Equitable Language Access For many refugee, immigrant, and migrant (RIM) community members, navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system is challenging, even in normal times. During the COVID-19 pandemic, existing inequities in health and access to health care have been compounded by inadequate or insufficient COVID-19 information in languages other than English. To keep RIM communities safe, it is vitally important to convey information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines that is not only timely, accurate and accessible, but also culturally and linguistically relevant. Vaccinating Youth and Adults During Pediatric Visits When eligible children and their adult relatives have opportunities to get vaccinated at pediatric clinics and children's hospitals, some of the barriers to vaccinating the whole family are reduced. Young children see their pediatricians relatively frequently for well visits, or regular check-ups. Visits for adolescents and children aged 5 or older are an opportunity to talk to the whole family about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Motivational Interviewing Building vaccine confidence takes time and trust. Client-facing staff and others working directly with community members seeking to dispel fear, misinformation, and disinformation will usually need to engage and explore people's hesitancy before sharing accurate information. One helpful way to do this is using some of the techniques found in Motivational Interviewing. Encouraging Youth to Mask Up and Get Vaccinated for their Families and Community One successful strategy to slow the spread of COVID-19 in RIM communities is to appeal to young people. This can be done by highlighting their community's cultural values, which may include solidarity, collective responsibility, reciprocity, duty to family, respect for elders, or other values that are consistent with taking action to protect others. Messaging to Reduce Risk in Areas with Lower Vaccination Rates COVID-19 messaging changes rapidly and some health departments may face challenges with developing health messaging that reaches all communities. In areas with lower vaccination rates and among populations with a degree of vaccine hesitancy, it is vitally important to promote a layered approach to risk mitigation. Youth and Young Adult Ambassadors Youth and young adults continue to have low COVID-19 vaccination rates across the US. Engaging youth is vital in the next stage of vaccine promotion and for reaching herd immunity. Learn how youth ambassadors bring their unique perspectives on how to cut through the noise to deliver important COVID-19 messaging to young people. Community Fairs Community fairs are a promising way to offer vaccination and other useful services to RIM communities in a relaxed and informal setting. Hosted at an accessible site, community fairs can be organized around themes ranging from school to community health to community resources like food, rent and utility assistance. Read more about how community fairs can be implemented in your community. Working with Interpretation Companies to Facilitate COVID-19 Vaccine Sign Up Reliance on internet-based registration and locations that accommodate large numbers of people for vaccine administration may be ineffective for many RIM communities due to linguistic limitations, unreliable internet access and overall internet navigation barriers. Partnerships with interpretation services are essential to reach RIM communities, maximize resources, and improve the delivery of services and resources. Partnering with Social Media Influencers Social media is a primary source of information for much of the US public, especially youth and young adults. Organizations that are unable to utilize social media to engage with the community can result in a trusted and known presence being absent from this important space, allowing myths, misinformation and disinformation to spread without competition. A solution that can help LHDs and CBOs reach RIM communities through social media, while saving time and effort, is leveraging existing social media influencers. COVID-19 Vaccine Collaborative Collaboratives are community engagement structures that facilitate communication between health departments and communities and are being used to support COVID-19 vaccine roll out. Role of Public Libraries in COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout Public libraries serve as ideal partners for COVID-19 vaccination rollout. As a trusted source of information and a well-connected hub within their local communities, libraries across America are working with local and state governments and community leaders to support vaccination efforts. Hyperlocal Videos of City and State COVID-19 Updates It is vital that linguistically and culturally appropriate messaging created by and from the community is accessible. These informal videos respond to RIM communities' expressed concerns while disseminating major local and regional updates from city and state officials. Videos to Document and Share Vaccine Experiences Among Community Members Ensuring access to accurate vaccine facts and information about vaccination sites and the process is critical for RIM community members to overcome misconceptions and barriers in access to COVID-19 vaccines. RIM community members are recording their experiences navigating vaccination sites and receiving the vaccination. Sharing these real experiences allows the RIM community to see what they can expect when visiting a site, which can ease mistrust or confusion. Staff Testimonials to Normalize Vaccine Experiences Public health departments, resettlement agencies, ethnic-based community organizations, community-based organizations and others working with refugee, immigrant and migrant (RIM) communities can help overcome misinformation and disinformation by creating their own staff testimonial videos. It can be particularly helpful when vaccinated staff are also multilingual and from RIM communities. Using Storytelling to Increase Vaccine Confidence The availability of accurate COVID-19 information that is culturally- and linguistically relevant is essential to keeping communities safe. Use testimonials that portray real stories from community members to communicate trusted information and make positive behavior changes. Phone Trees to Facilitate Vaccine Access To respond effectively to COVID-19 and to longstanding health inequities made worse by the pandemic, it is essential to leverage community strengths and trusted community networks. Phone trees are one strategy to disseminate important public health information during the pandemic. Initiating the COVID-19 Vaccine Conversation through Flyers Dispelling myths and alleviating apprehensions around vaccination requires a trusted relationship and a safe, non-judgmental environment for individuals to voice their concerns and ask questions. Initiating COVID-19 vaccine conversations through flyers is a creative way to use a traditional communication method. Assisting Migrants Accessing Second COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Tracking vaccine doses for migrants is a necessary step towards providing accessible and equitable healthcare for migrants, and can make getting second COVID-19 vaccine doses easier, resulting in a successful completion of the second shot in a two-dose vaccine. Using Facebook Groups to Navigate the COVID-19 Vaccine Sign-Up Process Using Facebook groups to connect individuals to assistance with COVID-19 vaccine sign up is an emerging promising practice to address barriers that some community members may face. COVID-19 Vaccine Sign Up through Trusted Messengers One strategy to address vaccine sign up challenges is to encourage COVID-19 vaccine registration through trusted messengers. These messengers, oftentimes community leaders, will be uniquely positioned to deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate COVID-19 vaccine information and be able to interpret and translate relevant information for COVID-19 vaccine registration. Referral Systems for Vaccine Access Community mapping is a virtual mapping method created through community engagement that elicits local community members and their networks and is a powerful tool to identify and reach RIM communities. Multilingual COVID-19 Vaccine Education Workshops COVID-19 vaccine education workshops, facilitated in a language the community member understands, increases trust, and helps RIM community members make informed decisions about COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their communities. Partnerships with Refugee Resettlement Agencies Refugee resettlement agencies are deeply rooted in RIM communities and are uniquely positioned to partner with health departments to reach community members during COVID-19 response efforts. Partnerships with Consulates Engaging with consulates is a strategy for building or enhancing relationships with refugee, immigrant, and migrant communities. Vaccine Ambassadors Program The Vaccine Ambassador program is led by a state health department and supports community members to serve as trusted messengers of COVID-19 vaccine information. Embedding Equity throughout the COVID-19 Response Organizational Structure It is essential to integrate considerations for refugee, immigrant, and migrant communities into all aspects of public health response efforts. Read more about the Minnesota Department of Health's work to embed equity throughout the COVID-19 response organizational structure. Physician-Driven Vaccine Outreach Physicians and other healthcare providers are frequently viewed as leaders and trusted sources of information, especially if they are from the communities they serve. Culturally Specific Vaccine Information Broadcasts By partnering with media outlets that are trusted in the community, vaccine messages can be culturally tailored and address unique concerns. COVID Champions: Trusted Faith Leaders A COVID-19 Champion is someone who helps disseminate accurate information on public health and safety, local support services, and their own experiences relating to COVID-19 to specific communities, including related to COVID-19 vaccines. Facebook Videos to Engage Communities The use of Facebook to share informational videos about COVID-19 among RIM communities and/or to deliver live content through the Facebook Live feature are promising practices for reaching RIM communities. Encouraging COVID-19 Vaccination through Sports Building trust in the vaccine through community partnerships and respected officials are key to improving vaccination rates. Engaging communities at familiar and frequented event sites, such as sporting and routine athletic events may be one strategy to decrease some of the barriers to vaccination access for RIM communities. Pop-Up COVID-19 Vaccine Sites Through community partnerships, \"pop-up\" COVID-19 vaccine sites in locations such as apartment complexes are a promising practice to bring vaccines directly to the community. Mobile Vaccine Units to Serve Communities Ensuring equitable barrier-free access to vaccines and accurate health information is especially critical for RIM communities to mitigate the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19. Mobile vaccine units are proving to be a successful solution for ensuring COVID-19 vaccines reach RIM populations. Convenient Vaccine Access for Communities Bringing vaccines to communities, rather than relying on community members to find their way to medical services, is more efficient and has much greater efficacy. Select this promising practice to learn more. Vaccine Listening Sessions with Communities A listening session is a facilitated discussion with a group of individuals aimed at collecting information about a specific topic. Listening sessions are an effective way to hear directly from communities about COVID-19-related topics, including vaccines. Select this promising practice to learn more about vaccine listening sessions. Vaccine Campaign Partnerships with Faith-Based Organizations Faith-based organizations frequently play an integral role within communities. Select this promising practice to learn more about involving faith-based organizations in vaccine campaigns. Research has shown that people are more likely to become vaccinated if they are knowledgeable about both the disease and the vaccine that protects them from infection. Community Engagement is Key Members of any community know best how to communicate with their peers, which is why we advocate for community involvement as a central element to any COVID-19 response. [Learn more](/node/161) Culturally-Relevant Messaging When developing your messaging, make sure you cater to the community's needs and preferences with regard to trusted messengers, literacy level and format. You'll also need to answer their questions - community listening sessions are one way to achieve this. [Learn more](/node/211) Tailored distribution Distribution should be tailored to a community's preferences. For example, before the pandemic, research showed that some Latino communities trusted information provided by schools and churches, as well as media sources like TV, radio and social media. In fact, some communities trusted radio more than TV because it is less sensational. Home-based education was also effective. It is essential to confirm these preferences in the current era of COVID-19 before beginning a campaign. A Welcoming Environment One way to address vaccine hesitancy is to create a welcoming environment: - Provide vaccine information in advance - Have an interpreter present - Don't rush the patients as they make choices - Give clear directions about what to expect - Be patient with follow-up questions Never stop inquiring about patients' vaccine status and to take time to address a parent's concerns. For example, research has shown that Somali refugees are more open to vaccines if healthcare providers bring it up frequently and continue to offer the vaccine even after refusal. "}
