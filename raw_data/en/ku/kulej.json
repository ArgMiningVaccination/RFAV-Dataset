Nowhere has that been more evident than at Broward Health, which in the past six months appointed through internal promotion a new CEO, CAO and CFO.

Immersive Simulation T raining Clinical Skills and Critical Thinking BY BARBARA R. FALLON Nursing education has come a long way from the prototype Resusci-Annie used in early CPR training, but that was the beginning of Clinical Assistant Professor Henry Henao's interests in blending technology with health care education and training. As an EMT he grew up (career-wise) in the mid 80's and appreciated the hands-on 'feel' of the CPR manakins. He moved on to other career opportunities but returned to health care, inspired by 9/11 heroics of first responders. He earned his BSN, MSN nursing degrees and is a PhD candidate. He was motivated toward forward think-ing about challenges for the future. Now , Director of the Simulation Teaching and Research Center (STAR) at Florida International University (FIU), he over-sees an immersive experience in a variety of hospital settings and training scenarios for future nurses and other health care professionals. The STAR Center was recently recog- nized as South Florida's only fully accredited simulation education facility to give students real-world practice with Continued on page 13Leadership Roundtable: Broward Health Executives Karen Meador A Path for Unleashing Nurse-Led Innovation BY KAREN MEADOR, MBA I've seen firsthand the powerful impact of nurse innovators. Nurses, the front line to direct patient care, spend significantly more time with an individual patient than the attending physician or subspecialty consultant and can in turn recognize and address issues that may otherwise go unnoticed. Take Penn Nursing's Kathy Bowles, for instance. Bowles, PhD, RN, FAAN, noticed a trend: Elderly patients were all too often ending up back in the hospital soon after being discharged. After conducting research into the dis- charge process and readmission rates of elderly hospital patients, she pinpointed a group of high-risk variables that pre-Salute to Nursing BY DANIEL CASCIATO In mid-March, Jupiter Medical Center appoint-ed Joanne Miller and Steven Seeley as interim co-CEOs, giving the hos-pital's board of trustees time to select a new pres-ident and CEO. \"The board of trustees made the decision to appoint two people because they thought it was in the best interest of the organization,\" says Miller. \"It allows for a smooth interim period of time with two leaders that our team members and physicians trust.\" Seeley agrees and adds, \"Our vision is to keep moving forward with the strategic plan.\" CNOs with Executive Experience Easily T ransition to Interim Co-CEO Role at Jupiter Medical CenterNursing Salute to Nurses See pages 14-41Continued on page 41 See pages 46-56 (l-r) Alan Goldsmith, Executive Vice President/CAO; Alex Fernandez, Senior Vice President/CFO; and Gino Santorio, President/CEO.

The idea is to determine whether a person who calls the 911 emergency line can be taken to a more suitable place than automatically being sent to an emergency room. Matt Johnson, general manager of Century Ambulance Service, explained the patients could be going to different loca-tions that are more appropriate - even the patient's physician's office, if they could handle the patient. Medicare will pay for them to be transported to an urgent care center that accepts Medicare so they can get treated at a lower price, or even be treated on-scene. Medicare would save money because not everyone will be going to the hospital for treat-ment. Applications to participate in the model are expected to be released in a few months, and Johnson said that while everything is just being proposed at this point, his company is considering apply-ing. \"They announced it earlier this year but not all of the details are out yet, we will have more specifics this summer.\" He added, \"In the past, whenever some-one would call 911, the only option for whoever was going to transport them was to send them to an emergency room that was attached to a hospital. But not everyone who calls 911 needs an ER with all of its resources and price.\" As an example, Johnson pointed out that previously , someone with a sprained ankle who called 911 would have auto-matically been taken to an emergency room, when a trip to an urgent care cen-ter would have been sufficient. \"Now you can take them to urgent care. It's a big paradigm shift in the way emergency care in the field has been treated in the past. Before, you were just picked up and taken to the hospital and somebody would get reimbursed for tak-ing you to the ER. Now it's changing because you can transport the person to the most appropriate location.\" However, he added that if the person insists on going to the ER, they will be taken there. \"Yes, absolutely . None of this trumps the patient's choice.\" Because of the potential importance of this program, Johnson believes Century Ambulance should seek to be a part of it. \"As a large ambulance provider in the state of Florida, I think it's important for us to participate in this program because it is the direction that health care is head-ing - providing more appropriate care where it's not so expensive and when it's not necessary . It's reshaping the direction of the way pre-hospital emergency care is being delivered. We want to help drive that change as a positive thing, so it just makes sense to be a part of it.\" In addition, Johnson believes the idea behind the program will be effective, calling it a step in the right direction. \"T wenty years from now , will it look like it will next year? Probably not. It will evolve, but I believe it's the right type of evolution to occur.\" He said people in the pre-hospital fields have known for a long time that for many of the transports they do, the patients don't need to go to the ER. \"But transporting them to the ER was basically the only choice.\" Another recent, front-line aspect of medicine that could be incorporated into the care is telemedicine, which Johnson said is a means of bringing the hospital to patients in the field. Telemedicine has become a big part of health care, with monitors being brought in and doctors video-streaming and speaking to patients. He said part of the ET3 model allows for this. \"Somebody might be experiencing something that they perceive to be an emergency , but telemedicine can be used on-scene to help diagnose whether the ER is appropriate; or perhaps they should go to an urgent care or see the family physician, and both the family physician and the EMS providers will be reimbursed for the service. It's a whole new level of care that could be adminis-tered in the field that really hadn't been done in the past. If you think about it, it's kind of like a modern version of a doctor making a house visit.\" In summarizing Medicare's proposed ET3 program, Johnson said, \"It allows us to take the patient to a more appropriate location for more appropriate care at the right price. Ideally , at the end of the day , Medicare believes it will reduce the amount of money it will spend on people going to the ER.\" For more information, call (905) 356-0835 or visit centuryambulance.com.

Being able to quickly and easily access scrubs, for example, makes it easier for healthcare providers to do their jobs, and gives them one less area of concern. The ScrubVAULT System from ImageFIRST, which launched in select markets last year, has earned high praise from medical staff as well as hospital and ambulatory center administrators. A recent survey of staff at the Cleveland Clinic Florida in Coral Springs, for example, showed a 95 percent approval rate among users, who gave it very high marks. Survey comments included the fact that the program was easy to implement, and inventory was easily manageable. Not only was the staff happy with it, but it was a big hit with those who trans-ferred from other Cleveland Clinic Florida locations that didn't have a ScrubVAULT System. According to the survey , respondents liked the ease and simplicity of the sys-tem, the large amount of inventory , and the flexibility to select the size scrub they wanted. \"When asked what we should change, every single person said 'nothing,'\" explained Jay Juffre, vice president of operations and national service director of ImageFIRST. \"The great thing about this is that when they're not worrying about little things, like where and when to get scrubs, they are better able to focus on patient care.\" The ScrubVAULT System makes it easy for staff to get the garments they need. \"Traditionally , scrubs would be stored in a locker room, where staff had to hope that they could find their size, and then they would return the scrubs at the end of the day ,\" explained Juffre. \"The more modern approach is to have a scrub vending machine in the basement, where it has to be kept because it's pretty large, which dispenses one set of scrubs. If a person wants more than one set because they have a number of procedures that day , they have to go down to get new scrubs each time they want to change.\" Because of the ScrubVAULT System's compact size, multiple units can be placed throughout a facility and do not have to be relegated to the basement, sav-ing staff the time and effort of having to travel to a single unit. It scans each employee's unique QR code, opens in less than two seconds, and the user can select as many scrubs as they need. \"Because all of the scrubs are UHF RFID-chipped, the facility knows who took what when,\" said Juffre. \"When staff turn the scrubs back in, there is a record of it, which increases accountabil-ity .\" So much so, in fact, that facilities that have been using the ScrubVAULT System have seen a decrease in overall scrub costs. \"People used to walk out with scrubs all the time; there was no way to keep track,\" said Juffre. \"Now that they are being tracked, people are more apt to return them, which means that our clients are controlling losses and reduc-ing costs.\" Administrators also appreciate the eas- ily accessible inventory and usage reports that are available at any time via ImageFIRST's online customer portal. Since introducing the ScrubVAULT System a year ago, ImageFIRST has deployed more than 100 units in six major markets. \"When people see it, they want it,\" said Juffre, adding that the innovative technology is designed to meet healthcare's quadruple aim approach. \"The goal is to control costs, keep patients and staff safe, take great care of patients, and keep staff engaged and happy ,\" said Juffre. \"In the last decade, patient care and staff engagement have taken on a higher priority , and the ImageFIRST program hits all four of these goals.\" ImageFIRST's dedicated representa- tives, called customer advocates, make sure that all of the products they provide are clean, safe and infection-free, and meet the needs of their clients. \"Patients are never happier than the staff is, so you want to make sure that you keep the staff happy ,\" said Juffre. \"Sheets with holes, missing lab coats, or gowns that aren't clean or have missing strings are frustrating. Dealing with these problems takes away from time with patients. \"Do you want your staff focused on the linen program or on patient care?\" he added. \"Our linen and scrub programs align with what is important to our cus-tomers.\" T o learn more about ImageFIRST or the ScrubVAULT System, call 800-932-7472 or visit www.imagefirst.com. ScrubVAULT System, Part of Quadruple Aim Approach, Ranks High with Healthcare Staff Miami Cancer Institute Opens Multidisciplinary Skin Cancer Clinic Miami Cancer Institute announces the opening of its Multidisciplinary Skin Cancer Clinic, including the regions' first (1 of only 12 in the world), 3D whole body photo-imaging system designed to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and other skin can-cers. The new technology , also known as the Vectra, uses 92 cameras that take simultaneous photos of the body in one sec-ond, and then creates a 3D view of the surface of the skin. This allows the dermatologist to potentially evaluate every suspi-cious lesion on the skin, both by physical exam and with the use of other sophisticated technolo-gy available in the clinic. The Multidisciplinary Skin Cancer Clinic at Miami Cancer Institute will focus on early detection and treatment of melanoma, in addition to treating patients with all types of skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel Cell tumors and other rare tumors of the skin. The program's team of experts includes dermatologists, surgical and medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and plastic and reconstructive surgeons.

On December 28, 2018, a Task Group that includes U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") personnel and private-sec-tor health care industry leaders published new guidance for health care organizations on cyberse-curity best practices. The guide - Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices: Managing Threats and Protecting Patients - is just that, a guide for health-care organizations as they begin to navi-gate the cybersecurity world. This is a start to helping your facility take the steps to becoming cyber secure and helps answer those nagging questions keeping you up at night. As mentioned in the guide, the Task Force does not expect the practices cited to become a de facto set of requirements that all organizations must implement. Such a dogmatic approach is not effective given the dynamic nature of cybersecuri-ty threats and the fast pace of technology evolution and adoption. Furthermore, they do not guarantee that the suggested practices will aid organizations in meet-ing their compliance and reporting obli-gations, but do answer the prevailing questions, \"Where do I start and how do I adopt certain cybersecurity practices?\" While it is impossible to address every cybersecurity challenge, the Task Group identifies five prevalent cybersecurity threats. 1. Email phishing attacks - an attacker masquerades as a trusted individual, dupes a victim into opening an email and sending private infor- mation - such as wiring money , sending pass- words or personal details. 2. Ransomware attacks - malicious soft- ware that threatens to publish one's data or block access unless a ransom is paid 3. Loss or theft of equipment or data 4. Insider, accidental or intentional data loss - from employees 5. Attacks against connected medical devices that may affect patient safety The Task Group also established a set of voluntary best practices and created 10 categories. Each of these categories is detailed within two supplementary tech-nical volumes - one addressing the needs of small organizations and the other addressing the requirements of medium and large organizations - and added resources, including templates and toolk-its for determining the cybersecurity practices that would be most effective for your organization. So what does this all mean? The healthcare industry is one of the most heavily-regulated industries when it comes to cybersecurity practices. Within the Guidance by the HHS Task Force, there are compelling metrics that should lead you to understanding the need for change within your own cybersecurity practices and defenses, and Withum's Cyber and Information Security Team has the experience you need to keep your healthcare organization protected.

HHS Guide: Steps T oward Cybersecurity BY JOSEPH RICCIE St. Mary's Medical Center and the Palm Beach Children's Hospital Becomes First Hospital in the Region to Use Flow Diverter for T reatment of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms St. Mary's Medical Center is the first hospital in Palm Beach and Broward counties to use the Surpass Streamline Flow Diverter to treat unruptured large and giant wide neck intracranial aneurysms. The device is the second flow diverting stent to gain FDA approval in the U.S. It is also approved and available in many markets around the world. \"We're honored to be the only hospital in the region with the capacity to treat patients requiring this innovative treatment,\" said hospital CEO Gabrielle Finley-Hazle. \"For more than 10 years, the team at our Comprehensive Stroke Center, has made it their mission to continue bringing the most advanced services to our commu-nity .\" The tight wire mesh of the device restricts blood from entering the sac of the intracranial aneurysm, which helps to promote clotting. The Surpass Streamline Flow Diverter is indicated for the treatment of brain aneurysms in patients 18 years of age and older. The device is intended to treat large or giant saccular intracranial aneurysms with a wide-neck (neck width 4 mm or wider or dome-to-neck ratio less than 2) or fusiform intracranial aneurysms (an elongated, spindle shaped aneurysm involving the entire vessel wall) in the internal carotid artery (which supplies blood to the brain) with a diameter between 2.5 mm and 5.3 mm.

For some residents and medical students it can range from $200K-$500K or more in debt. According to the 2016 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Medical School Graduation Questionnaire, 4 out of 5 medical students bor-row from student loan institutions to finance their studies. Some studies show that high stu-dent loan debt burden influences medical stu-dents on what specialty they consider and they are least likely to choose specialties with lower salaries. In 2016 the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, noted that high debt has been \"correlated with callousness, stress, sui-cidal thoughts, failing medical licensing exams, and leaving or being dismissed from medical school.\" The average Medical School debt is $206,000 for those who attend private medical school according to the Association of American Medical colleges (AAMC) survey study conducted in 2017. Although earning potential is high among physicians, the years spent in residency are often times marked with low pay , $51,000 on average. There are some Loan Forgiveness Program (LFP) options for residents in certain specialties like family medicine. For some physicians with federal student loans the LFP grants provide relief on certain loan balances after ten years of work in public service. The years spent in residency qualify for part of the program requirements if you are employed at a non-profit institution. Almost every academic hospital is a non-profit allowing residents this opportunity . According to a student loan planner at a consulting firm, the best path for a resident who is unsure would be to choose a revised Pay as You Earn loan to receive the interest subsidies while keeping the door open to repayment options. It is imperative for residents and students to conduct their own investigation on what loan payment plan works for them or risk drowning in debt.

How Loans Impact Career Decision Making for Physician Residents BY JACQUELLINE LEVA, DO If you were hanging out with a group of friends and trying to decide what your next fun event together would be, I doubt anyone would jump to suggest going to a symphony orchestra. Even if you are a fan, when the words symphony orchestra are presented, words like for-mal, sophisticated, and maybe even dry come to mind. However, do not tell that to the Andre Rieu - Johann Strauss Orchestra. Some of you know exactly what I am talking about, but for the others, over the past couple decades, this orchestra has been selling out sta-diums around the world. In 2018 they were ranked 15th in the list of top 20 global concert tours, just ahead of acts like Brittany Spears and Shakira (no other show of its kind even came close). If you have not seen them in action, feel free to YouT ube them. You'll see a fun, exciting show with fans of all ages literally dancing in the aisles having a great time. Fireworks, lasers and smoke effects are also part of the pro-duction. They took a traditional, predictable experience and made it remarkable - different in a good way . The same should be true for patient care. If someone is sitting around talking to their friends about an upcoming doctor visit or overnight stay in the hospital, what words typically come to mind then?

What if, people left motivated to tell their friends and fam-ily about how great they were treated, how it was not what they expected, and how others would be crazy not to switch health care providers immedi-ately .

(SFHEF) is an international professional society of more than 30,000 healthcare executives who lead hospitals, healthcare systems and other healthcare organizations. While its members come from many different backgrounds, board member-at-large Simone Fearon, MD, would like to see more participation from physicians, whom she believes could bene-fit from the support that the group offers. \"I joined the organization after returning to school to work on my MBA,\" explained the noninvasive cardiologist, who for the past eight years has served as co-founder, chief operating officer and senior consult-ant cardiologist for Florida Heart and Vascular Consultants in Miami and Fort Lauderdale. \"I was exploring the idea of taking on a more administrative-type role, and was looking for organizations that sup-ported hospital and other healthcare lead-ers. The South Florida Healthcare Executive Forum dominates in that area. \"Their role is to help promote excellence in healthcare, and they accomplish this by providing educational opportunities for professional development as well as net-working events for healthcare executives and potential healthcare leaders,\" she added. \"For what they do, they're not just a leader in South Florida, but beyond, and this was really attractive to me.\" Dr. Fearon specializes in general, non- invasive cardiology consultation, cardiac imaging, preventive cardiology and well-ness and women's cardiology . She received her medical degree from the University of the West Indies and completed her post-doctoral training with an internship and residency in internal medicine, and a fel-lowship in cardiovascular diseases at Lenox-Hill Hospital, New York. In addition to being a member of SFHEF and the American College of Healthcare Exec utives (ACHE), she is a member of the American College of Cardiology and the American Society of Echocardiography . According to Dr. Fearon, being a mem-ber of SFHEF gives her insight into what is required of healthcare executives as she considers transitioning into a new role. \"As I'm nearing the completion of my MBA, I'm looking forward to taking on the challenges of medicine from a different platform,\" she explained. \"I'm learning more about the opportunities available as I begin to shift my practice style, which was previously 100 percent clinical, to one that is more of a hybrid role that includes hos-pital administration.\" Dr. Fearon believes that physicians, as well as other healthcare professionals, can benefit from the educational opportunities and networking that SFHEF provides. \"While I didn't know much about the organization before I began working toward my master's degree, I've since real-ized the benefits of the organization and joined the board to take on the role of physician champion so that I could edu-cate other physicians about the types of support SFHEF offers,\" she said. \"Our goal is to increase physician participation on a much larger scale. \"It's been a challenge, but we're getting there,\" she added. \"I think the biggest rea-son for low physician engagement is really a lack of awareness of the organization and its numerous benefits relevant to the differ-ent phases of their careers.\" T o learn more about the South Florida Healthcare Executive Forum, visit www.sfhef.org.

PD leads to disabling motor features including tremor, reduced speed, and gait/balance impairment leading to falls, as well as non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment and sleep and speech disorders. One of the most prevalent complications in PD patients is medication ON and OFF motor fluctuations, which occur in 50 percent of patients diagnosed within three to five years and 80 percent diagnosed within 10 years. The onset of these motor fluctuations is a critical point in managing the disease because it requires ongoing adjustments in treatment such as changing the frequency and dosage of medication or changing parameters for deep brain stimulation. Currently , PD motor fluctuations are addressed with brief clinical examina- tions or appropriate history-taking and patient self-reports, which rely on extensive patient education. Even then, self-reports can be unreliable and clinical examinations may not be practical, especially in rural areas. Patients often require frequent follow-up visits with their neurologist. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University's College of Engineering and Computer Science have developed an innovative way to automatically and reliably detect and monitor medication ON and OFF states in PD patients. They have combined an algorithm and sensor-based system that detects ON and OFF state patterns in PD patients using two wearable motion sensors placed on the patient's most affected wrist and ankle. For the study , published in the journal Medical Engineering and Physics, these sensors collected movement signals while patients performed seven daily living activities such as walking or getting dressed in their medication ON and OFF phases. The algorithm was trained using approximately 15 per-cent of the data from four activities and tested on the remaining data. Data from the two sensors provided objective measures instead of a patient diary or self-report. Results of the study reveal that the algorithm was able to detect the response to medication during the subjects' daily routine activities with an average of 90.5 percent accuracy , 94.2 percent sensitivity , and 85.4 percent specificity . 12 May 2019 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsLee Health Aging Life Care Manager Named to Florida Aging Life Care Board The Florida Chapter of Aging Life Care Association has named Dawn Moore, RN, an Aging Life Care Manager with Lee Health, to its state board of directors for 2019-2020.

Kreger CORRECTION: On page 5 of the April 2019 issue of South Florida Hospital News and Healthcare Report, an incorrect photo of Marcia Rabinowits ran with the article Cultural Sensitivity: Key to Care and Recovery. Marcia RabinowitsSouth Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com May 2019 13Gino Santorio, President/CEO, Broward Health. \"I've been very direct that no matter what, we will do the right thing. Our success is contingent upon charac-ter, and I'm proud to be surrounded by 8,000-plus employees who have remained committed to acting in the best interests of our patients and communi-ty .\" Since Santorio was named the perma- nent CEO in December 2018 and Alan Goldsmith, former Broward Health CFO, was named Executive Vice President/CAO and Alex Fernandez named the Senior Vice President/CFO in January 2019, this leadership - with the support of the North Broward Hospital District Board of Commissioners - has hired a new Individual Review Organization (IRO), renegotiated numer-ous contracts for operational efficiency and been proactive in engaging elected state officials for Critical Care Funding. Santorio, Goldsmith and Fernandez consider these types of complexities that are pressuring healthcare to now be the industry norm. Managing these issues demands a broader perspective than what once may have been required of leadership. \"The new model of a healthcare CFO is certainly different,\" says Fernandez. \"No longer does the CFO focus only on finance. Today's healthcare leader has to be diverse and able to talk on all different levels and across skill sets. We all cross over to each other's lanes, and it works well.\" \"I would even go as far as saying that the healthcare system was much differ-ent less than five years ago,\" says Goldsmith. \"The constant change - and change is a guarantee in healthcare - is going to be rapid. Your ability to be nim-ble and think quickly to get ahead of the curve is essential.\" Santorio added that healthcare leaders must also now work with a greater num-ber of players. \"A typical day for me can include strategizing our payer model with man-aged care partners, then educating Tallahassee on funding perspectives, before counseling staff on organizational matters and communicating with patients and physicians to help them select the best value for care,\" he says. \"It's complex, but Alan, Alex and I are excited about the challenges.\" Santorio, Goldsmith and Fernandez all came to Broward Health knowing there would be unique opportunities to rebuild a health system that was in need of strong management, impeccable ethics and a commitment to ensure high quality care for all those served. Goldsmith was recruited by a former Broward Health CEO. Having started his career as an assistant in a human resources department, he quickly moved his way up the ranks and across organi-zations until joining Broward Health as CFO in 2017. \"I knew they were in the middle of a turnaround,\" he says. \"I live in Broward County and wanted to help be part of Broward Health's change.\" Goldsmith quickly recruited Santorio, who says he was familiar with the turn-around environment Broward Health was facing, having just come from a sim-ilar environment. \"At that point in my career, I decided after speaking to Alan that I could help the organization and it was something I thought I would like to do,\" Santorio notes, also joining Broward Health in 2017 as the COO. While Fernandez arrived at Broward Health under different circumstances, he has been no less committed to fortifying the health system. He started as a staff accountant with a hospital in Palm Beach County and ultimately worked his way up to the role of COO, but he missed finance. \"There was a CFO position open at Broward Health Medical Center,\" he explains. \"I researched the hospital and its service lines, as well as the tertiary component of the hospital. I applied for the role and was offered the job. It was the best decision I've made in my career thus far.\" Santorio and Goldsmith share similar views, noting that while demanding, it's an exciting time to lead Broward Health for many reasons. Steering a special tax-ing district, which essentially means the system is owned by the taxpayers of Broward County , presents its own chal-lenges. Broward Health hospitals are treating some of the most critical and complex medical cases. \"I could give a hundred reasons why I'm inspired to come to work each day ,\" says Santorio. \"But it ultimately boils down to patient care. For example, if you show up to a Broward Health trauma center with any vitals, there's a 98 per-cent chance that you're going to survive. Those kind of survival rates are unprece-dented, and that's just one sample of the spectacular care we regularly provide for our patients.\" \"We are caring for those who can't care for themselves,\" says Fernandez. \"From hospitals and clinical care to community outreach, we are filling a void. Without Broward Health, there are a number of residents in Broward County who would not have medical care. As a leader, the significance of that drives you.\" The magnitude of this work might intimidate others, but for Goldsmith, there's a simple reason they are willing to put in the hours they do: Broward Health is this leadership team's passion. \"If you don't love what you're doing,\" he says, \"then you should reconsider what you're doing.\" Santorio and Fernandez also cautioned future healthcare leaders to carefully consider their career development strate-gies. \"Young professionals need to deter- mine what they want long term,\" Santorio says. \"They need to identify dif-ferent avenues to achieve their career goals, and finally , and this is the most critical component, they need to be will-ing to do the work. \"I know Alan, Alex and I have put in our time and punched our dance ticket, so to speak. We worked our way up through lower level positions. We put in the hours and were willing to go where other people weren't. We took risks. That is something people need to decide if they're willing to do.\" \"You need to be open to accepting additional responsibilities,\" adds Fernandez. \"It's not always going to be easy , because you're going to have your current workload, plus additional responsibilities. But reaching your career aspirations will be worth the effort.\" Most importantly , Broward Health's new leadership continued to stress the importance of doing the right thing. \"Treat people at all levels fairly ,\" says Fernandez. \"Regardless of your role, that goes a long way . Be accountable and help grow the people around you.\" \"Listen to people, understand expecta- tions and act with integrity ,\" says Goldsmith. \"When you know in your bones that you and your organization have acted in good faith, you will ulti-mately succeed.\" \"I say this all the time,\" says Santorio, agreeing with Goldsmith. \"Do the right thing. It sounds easy , but it can be chal-lenging. I promise you that if you do the right thing, you'll never go wrong.\" For more information, visit www.browardhealth.org.

Florence's father, however, had other ideas: He wanted her to be a dentist. A sudden relocation shook up those plans and opened the door for Florence to pursue her child- hood dream. In 2011, she joined VITAS as a home care nurse in Palm Beach, where she still works today . For Florence, the best part of the job is the feeling of having helped someone at the end of the day , even if it's a single step out of bed. \"I love nursing,\" Florence says. \"Nursing to me is second nature, it's what I've committed my life to. And I love what I do right now with hospice: bringing comfort to both patients and their families.\" Lisa Powers, RN After graduating from the University of Connecticut in 1989, Lisa Powers, RN, pursued her dream of working as a traveling nurse, spending five years in hospitals, emergency departments and intensive care units in Hawaii and Washington, D.C. Hospice nursing had always intrigued her, especially after experiencing the death of her grandparents on hospice care. She switched to hospice nursing 25 years ago, and today she cares for VITAS patients in assisted care facilities in Palm Beach County . \"My grandparents' hospice nurses were wonderful,\" she says. \"They put everyone at ease, got every- one on the same page. I knew then that hospice nursing was my calling, and I fell in love with it. In my personal life, I really like to get to know people, and I don't like fluff. In hospice nursing there's no fluff. People share their most personal secrets and thoughts with you, and you help them die at home. To be a nurse in the last stages of someone's life is just wonderful.\" National Nurses Week: May 6-12 Nurses Week is celebrated from May 6-12, 2019, and \"South Florida Hospital News and Healthcare Report\" would like to salute nurses across the U.S. The following nurses are some of South Florida's best!

They cared for him in a way I knew I would want to.\" Since her first day at Broward Health Medical Center on November 6, 1986, Proctor has worked in a number of units.

When it comes to giving back to their community , the Clinical Ladder Committee of Memorial Regional Hospital South in Hollywood tends to think outside of the box to make a differ-ence. The team, comprised of more than 20 registered nurse leaders in their respective fields and specialty areas, departed from that approach for a good cause - the homeless in Broward County . In an effort to bring much needed sup- plies to the homeless they joined the United Way in what is called the Shoebox Project. The team banded together to collect and assemble more than 100 shoe boxes, collected hundreds of items and pack-aged them for the project. Focusing their efforts on the less fortunate, they put their hearts into each shoe box by con-ducting a hospital-wide collection for items, and personally decorating each care package. Items collected were dozens of basic essentials including pre-paid phone cards, toiletries, socks, first aid supplies and much more. \"The shoeboxes are distributed to vul- nerable members of the community to help with their personal care needs,\" said Valarie Grumme, PhD, RN, CCRN, Director of Education at Memorial Regional Hospital South. \"The response from the hospital units was overwhelm-ing.\" Hazel Selorio, RN III, Clinical Ladder Chairperson, presented this project to the committee earlier this spring and the idea was met with unanimous response. \"As soon as we saw the flyer from United Way about this project we were fired up and motivated to take on the task,\" said Seloria. Selorio and the RN Clinical Ladder Committee went unit-to-unit to promote Project Shoebox as a way to help those in need in our local community . Initially , the Clinical Ladder Committee hoped to receive 30 to 50 shoeboxes to present to United Way . There were 108 boxes assembled with a personal touch from each of the nurses by the end of March. Nurses Put Heart, Soul, Hope Into Special Care Packages Anna Ferguson, BSN, RN As a Registered Nurse Leader with over 15 years of experience in Patient Care, Clinical Informatics, Information Technology , and Leadership, Anna Ferguson is a result driven professional with a passion for utilizing technology to improve the delivery of patient care. Her passion for nursing and a strong apti-tude for technology provided an opportunity to enhance clinical operations and serving as the Chief Nursing Officer and Operations for Camillus Health Concern, Inc. since 2016.

Anna is currently pursuing an MBA in Healthcare at Lynn University , Boca Raton. As a nurse leader, she provides clinical and operational oversight and serves as the Quality Leader for the organization. Anna has been recognized for leading several CHC quality initiatives leading to sev-eral national recognition by HRSA and NCQA. LaDonna McNealy, LPN LaDonna is part of the team at Camillus Health Concern, or more locally known as the Clinic at NCL campus. When not in the clinic as the nurse on duty she can be seen smiling and conversing with our Day Center clients in the Courtyard. LaDonna has been with Camillus Health for 3 years - 2 years working with the clients of Jail Diversion, ISPA and Phoenix before coming to the clinic. Asked what she likes best about being with Camillus - the ability to freely give back what was so freely given to her! This is a reflection from her being in recovery , and as she says of working in the clinic, she is with \"her people\" know-ing the struggles and joys of where they come from. LaDonna has 2 other blessings in her life - one daughter and one son, of whom she hopes for their continued health and happiness.CAMILLUS HEALTH CONCERN, INC At VITAS Healthcare, nurses are at the core of everything we do. They're a fundamental part of every hospice team, caring for our patients and families. Nurses are also integral to our origin: In 1978, a registered nurse, Esther Colliflower, and a Methodist minister, Hugh Westbrook, founded the hospice company that would become VITAS Healthcare. VITAS celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, and we're proud to be the nation's leading provider of end-of-life care, caring for an average of 18,000 terminally ill patients each day and their families. We wouldn't have made it far without nurses. Over 40 percent of VITAS' 12,000 employees are nurses, and some of our strongest partner-ships are with nursing organizations, such as Florida Nurses Association, Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association, National Black Nurses Association, National Coalition of Ethnic Minority Nurse Associations, American Association for Men in Nursing, Nurses on Boards Coalition, National Association of Licensed Practical Nurses, American Nurses Association, Hispanic Nurses Association and Black Nurses Rock. Forging relationships that improve lives As an RN working at VITAS since 1983, I know firsthand the vital contributions of nurses in hospice and palliative care. I also understand the value of diversity in a hos-pice team: the significance of being cared for by professionals who look and speak like you, who may have grown up in a similar community , faced similar fears and navigat-ed similar situations. The relationships forged between nurses and patients can have a direct impact on the patient's well-being. Aside from family caregivers, nurses are the people with whom patients will spend most of their time. In many cases, nurses are the first people with whom a patient will share their inti- mate needs, fears and desires. Trust between patients and nurses is paramount. VITAS fosters that trust by providing culturally competent healthcare services in diverse communities. Empowering nurses to empower patients We take great steps to equip our nurses to best serve patients and families. Our nurses often work independently , traveling between patients' homes, nursing facilities and VITAS offices, so every nurse is given a secure cell phone to streamline communication. Our nurses can further their education with VITAS' tuition reim- bursement program and sign up for classes at VITAS.com/webinars, where all professionals are invited to learn about topics related to end-of-life care. We recognize that when nurses aren't caring for patients' families, many are caring for their own, so VITAS offers flexible schedules for full-time, part-time and per-diem employees. Many VITAS nurses\u2014myself included\u2014have gone on to hold higher positions within the company and beyond it. In South Florida, Patty Husted, RN, joined VITAS in 1989 as a team manager and is now senior vice president of operations throughout Florida. Betty Bel started as a patient care administrator in 2003 and is vice president of operations in Dade-Monroe and Broward counties. Lasting partnerships, proud legacies Partnerships with nursing organizations provide our nurses with additional oppor- tunities for professional growth and access to useful resources. As we continually invest in our employees so they may become the healthcare leaders and influencers of tomorrow , we also invest in the organizations committed to supporting healthcare professionals and improving outcomes for patients and families. Since 1978, VITAS has had a strong commitment to South Florida communities. We are proud to make a difference and honor and support nurses everywhere. I cannot imagine a more fulfilling career than the one I have had in hospice with VITAS. Peggy Pettit is executive vice president of VITAS\u00ae Healthcare. VITAS\u00ae Healthcare Partners in Support of Nurses and Patients BY PEGGY PETTIT , RN 38 May 2019 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsThe nursing profession has grown tremendously in the areas of respect, accountability , and impact on patient and organizational outcomes. Several significant challenges, however, must be addressed so that the difference nurses can make is fully realized and the joy and fulfillment that the practice can bring to nurses is fully appreciated. External forces impacting the health- care business, including governmental regulation, changes in reimbursement, and complex requirements for serving sicker and older populations, all directly influence nursing practices. Historically , nurses could focus on facilitating the healing process, educating patients, and reducing suffering. Today's nurses must also participate in time-consuming initiatives to enhance healthcare value as defined by the gov-ernment, incorporate complex technolo-gy in diagnostic and treatment processes, and reduce costs, all while performing their traditional care-oriented functions. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that physicians, who are intended to partner with nurses, are burning out at a rate high enough to be considered a public health crisis. The pressures from these factors can be exhausting, and leaders must address the associated disengagement that con-tinues to climb. To combat these pres-sures and enhance nursing retention and productivity , successful organizations are implementing measures to improve nurse engagement and emotional health. Healthcare reform also left nurses with hope that patients would seek regular care at local access points that would be more health-promoting, leaving only the sickest patients to be treated in hospital settings. This has not yet been realized. Patients continue to seek episodic care in hospitals rather than primary care sites, and highly acute patients still compete for nursing care in the same hospital set-tings. This pushes nurses to ration care so they can provide for everyone, and although stressful, they do it well. Many nurses are even seeking advanced degrees to better influence care at all touchpoints on the continuum, while assisting leaders in driving care to the appropriate access points. As a result, nurses are more relied upon and respect-ed now than ever for their contributions both inside and outside of the hospital. Consumer experience also matters dif- ferently now. In the past, patients' expec-tations were primarily related to healing and reduced suffering, and nursing inter-ventions were carried out accordingly . Today , patient experience is measured by the government and publicly reported. Those published reports frequently do not correlate with what nurses really believe their patients need, but the same nursing professionals are held responsi-ble for the results because of the nature of their interactions with the patients evaluating the care they've received from a wider range of professionals. Further, organizations count on nurses to influence scores that are measured by tools that don't necessarily give nurses appropriate credit for the very complex, highly technical, and scientific care they must deliver with compassion. Lastly , one of the most significant trends that nursing leaders are address-ing today is the widening gap between an experienced nursing workforce and the complexity of care required by the popu-lation served. An experience shortage is developing because the knowledge and skill of baby boomer nurses is disappearing as they retire, while the complexity of the patient population is simultaneously increasing. The gap driven by these two countervailing forces needs to be recog-nized and urgently addressed. To do so, progressive organizations are quickly implementing nurse residency programs and formal onboarding pro-grams that seek to bridge the gap and advance the practice of nurses. Overall, nurses are more recognized for the impact they make on the surviv-ability of healthcare organizations, and nurse leaders are increasingly becoming active members of the executive teams. Nursing contribution at all levels of the organization and well-organized nursing strategic plans greatly influence health-care system success.

Nursing ... Nursing ... Nursing ... Nursing ... Nursing ... Nursing ... Nursing ... As a nurse serving South Florida for over 25 years, I have witnessed sweep- ing changes in healthcare. From changes in policy , to the rise of debili-tating health conditions, nurses have always been on the front lines, manag-ing the care that impacts our families and our communities. When I became a chief nursing offi- cer, I felt it was my duty to volunteer my time serving nonprofit organiza-tions that had their finger on the pulse of how we as a community are caring for all our residents, especially the underserved. I joined the board of trustees at Palm Health Foundation because of its leadership in developing innovative solutions for emerging health challenges and advancing the nursing profession. As our healthcare system continues to evolve, collaborating with local part-ners like Palm Health Foundation helps us prepare nurses to deliver care in an ever-changing environment. The foun-dation relies on the insight of nursing leaders throughout Palm Beach County to determine the funding, education and initiatives needed to promote better health. One of the most evident challenges is how the residents of Palm Beach County are aging at faster-than-ever rates. In the next decade, one out of every five people in our community will become a senior citizen, and 80% of those seniors will have chronic health conditions. We know our aging population will require new ways for healthcare to be delivered, particularly in community-based settings and through home visits utilizing new technologies. Anticipating this trend early on, Palm Health Foundation established and funded the Volunteer Nurse Corps of Palm Beach County (VNC-PBC). Administered by Palm Beach Atlantic University , the VNC-PBC uses retired, volunteer and student nurses to help manage commu-nity care and home visits. Responding to the changes in our pop- ulation's ethnic diversity is another area where nurses can make an impact. Data suggests that a more diverse nursing workforce is part of the solution to achieving health equity . When nurses understand a patient's culture and com-munity , they can establish better trust, comfort and overall patient satisfaction. Nursing leaders can do their part through minority nurse recruitment. As a trustee at Palm Health Foundation, I am encouraged to see efforts to grow our nursing workforce and its diversity by providing annual scholarships to stu- dents who pledge to stay in Palm Beach County and work locally after they grad-uate. The foundation has awarded near- ly $3 million in nursing scholarships since 2001. Once hired, it is the nursing leader's job to retain nurses. One important way is through gratitude. In a 2004 survey*, 84% of respondents stated that they do not feel respected and appreciated in some capacity within their organization. Palm Health Foundation, with co-spon-sors Tenet Health and VITAS Healthcare, is giving all healthcare organizations a platform for recognizing their nurses through May's Thank a Nurse campaign. I encourage my fellow nursing leaders to join us by encouraging their nurses to take part in two upcoming events: \u0081 Nurses Night Out at Delray Marketplace on Thursday , May 2nd from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., a free event spon-sored by Hubbard Media for all Palm Beach County area nurses. \u0081 Heart of Gold Reception on Thursday , May 9th from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at Quail Ridge Country Club in Boynton Beach. The event will honor the extraordinary work of local nurses and recognize Palm Beach County's 2019 \"Nurses of the Year.\" There are many things that we can do as nursing leaders to anticipate trends and overcome challenges. Collaborating with our healthcare partners and recog-nizing our nurses for their tireless efforts are both positive ways to help us, our patients, and our community reach their full health potential.

Nursing Education ... Nursing Education ... Nursing Education ... The American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) has issued an Accreditation with Distinction to the oncology fellowship program devel-oped for nurse practitioners at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. This program, launched in November of 2016, was the first of its kind in Florida. It is now being recog-nized for its \"programmatic excel-lence\" by the ANCC Commission on Accreditation. \"Nurse practitioners play an essen- tial role in the care of the oncology patient,\" said Sylvester Director Stephen D. Nimer, M.D. \"They pro-vide caring, compassion and educa-tion, and they are dedicated advocates for exemplary patient care, guiding patients through their treatment process. We are proud to provide such an important program at the cancer center.\" Sylvester's program entails a year-long rotation through hematology/oncology and other specialties that interact with oncology patients to provide a multidisci-plinary curriculum. The program has expanded to include a psychosocial oncol-ogy , stem cell transplant and cellular therapy fellowship track for nurse practi-tioners. \"Unfortunately , many nurse practitioners are not specialized after graduation or lack experi-ence in areas like oncology ,\" said Jessica MacIntyre, MSN, APRN, Sylvester's executive director of clinical operations and co-direc-tor of the new fellowship pro-gram. \"Oncology is a highly special- ized field of medicine, and for-mal training is fundamental in order to provide quality , efficient care,\" said Maritza Alencar, DNP , MBA, APRN, Director, Clinical Operations at Sylvester and the fellowship program's other co-director. An article published in April 2018 the Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing, written by Alencar, MacIntyre and other Sylvester authors, points out that there are less than a dozen oncology nurse practitioner fellowships in the United States. Accreditation is important in establishing national standards. Sylvester is only the second nurse practitioner oncology fellowship program to receive accreditation by ANCC, which can be renewed every three year. To date, Sylvester's program has graduated three nurse practitioner oncology fellows.

The 20,000 sq. foot STAR Center at the FIU Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health Sciences, provides multimodal settings including emer-gency , pediatric, med-surg and obstetri-cal opportunities in hospital, ambulatory and family settings. Students practice with high-fidelity lifelike patient responses amplified with mixed reality learning lenses, robotics and other aug-mented reality techniques for first response to surgical and rehabilitation protocols. However, while the advanced 'bells and whistles' are incredibly impres-sive, they are the tools that the faculty uses to help tease out the advanced clin-ical thinking that prepares an exception-al practitioner. In addition to overseeing clinical expertise via technology , faculty provide students with monitoring, video capture and intensive debriefing to review , evalu-ate and discuss outcomes of clinical sim-ulations. According to Henao, facilitators help students to suspend disbelief. \"Com - munications are important in setting up emotionally raw background scenarios so that the education goes beyond the technical skills and theatrical remedies into identifying the clinical reasoning to unfold the rationale as to why an approach was utilized in terms of patient safety , family interactions and other psy-chological impact factors,\" he explained. For example, in mental health scenar- ios actors are specifically trained to pres-ent a variety of psychiatric disease mark-ers to help students identify subtle changes in mood behavior and learn how to approach agitated and suicidal patients in a real-world likeness while interacting with family and displaying empathy . This enlightened real-world thinking was envisioned beginning in 2008 when FIU Administration supported an invest-ment in space and dollars and staff for simulation education. This forethought is threaded throughout Florida Inter - national University health care education which strives to provide the bridge from academic concepts to contemporary practice encouraging faculty to share current strategies and on-the-job tactics in classroom and experiential industry residencies. Recently the STAR Center participated in a showcase of faculty innovations designed for student success. \"Experiential learning supports tradi- tional academic lectures, by using that knowledge to hone skills in small clinical control groups. This post-book-learning skills application helps students explore the thinking behind their appropriate clinical response,\" Henao explained. The STAR Center was also included in a landmark study published in nursing journals analyzing hybrid simulation and OTJ observations. The study indicated that up to 50% of simulation training improves clinical observation practicums for new nursing students. Henao favors a hybrid of simulation and clinical intern-ships to optimize nursing aptitude and marketability of FIU students. FIU has received positive feedback from CNOs who acknowledge a deeper understand-ing and readiness for nursing care along with enhanced confidence of FIU stu-dents who graduate with this immersive simulation education. \"Nurses are the 24/7 eyes and ears for their health care colleagues; and, having a safe experience in a simulated environ-ment that mimics the actual uncon-trolled circumstances of patient care integrates evidenced-based practice and hands-on exposure,\" Henao said. Beyond nursing education, the STAR Center provides mobile and in-situ train-ing including disaster response, aeromedical evacuation for the FIU Florida Advanced Surgical Transport (FIU-FAST) team and education to providers at their place of work for certi-fication, continuing education or profes-sional advancement purposes. Henao credits the recent accreditation as acknowledgement of FIU's early adapter lead and current maturity in sim-ulation innovation but doesn't want to stagnate. \"We now share our knowledge with partners in industry who manufac-ture the robotic technology to help them design patient responses to the pinnacle of quality which enhances patient care education in the future,\" he said.

Nursing Education ... Nursing Education ... Nursing Education ... Many nurses are retiring and with the aging popula- tion of South Florida, a crit-ical nursing shortage is anticipated. Florida Atlantic University's nursing pro-gram is responding to this call from the community to educate more nurses. Identifying a need in the community , FAU's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing has launched a new second-degree part-time track in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at FAU's Davie campus. The College of Nursing current-ly has an accelerated track for those with a previous B.S. or B.A. degree, but those admitted must quit their jobs due to the intensity of the program. This part-time program accommodates those who need to continue working while studying. FAU's new BSN degree is designed to prepare working professionals with a bachelor's degree or higher in another discipline, as professional nurses who are eligible to take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN\u00ae) to secure licen-sure as a registered nurse. The new program will commence in August, and FAU's College of Nursing already started accepting applications. The application period closes on Monday , July 15. This program is two years in length and will enroll 50 stu-dents every fall semester. Course scheduling formats for the pro- gram will include a live class one evening a week, labs, classes and clinicals on weekends, as well as online and live-streaming video course formats. With enrollment during six consecutive semesters, students can complete their BSN degree in two years. Features of the program include a ded- icated state-of-the-art education facility on FAU's Davie campus, clinical experi-ences in Broward County , and a dedicat-ed program adviser who guides the stu-dents in the working professional BSN track through their program of study and provides educational support from admission to graduation. The VIP concierge service is a full-service, all-inclusive BSN track specifically designed for those who have busy personal and professional commitments, as well as those who prefer the convenience of a full-service, structured cohort program. Program tuition is $719.84 per credit hour and is the same rate for Florida res-idents, out-of-state residents and inter-national students. The tuition covers assessment technology fees (approxi-mately $1,500), testing fees, a parking permit, student ID card, catered refresh-ments and snacks, uniforms and lab coat, equipment, graduation regalia, recording of select courses, a pre-program orienta-tion and a graduation banquet. FAU's College of Nursing methods of payment include financial aid, tuition reimbursement for students who receive tuition payments from employers and a self-pay option. A convenient install-ment payment plan is available to stu-dents who choose the self-pay option. T uition is deferred pending payment of financial aid and/or tuition reimburse-ment, if paperwork is submitted. FAU's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing is nationally and internationally known for its excellence and philosophy of caring science. The college is ranked No.1 in online graduate nursing pro-grams in Florida and No. 23 in the nation by U.S. News and World Report. With a 97 percent pass rate on the NCLEX-RN licensure examination in 2018, FAU BSN graduates, first-time test takers, ranked among the highest (No.1) in Florida and the United States. FAU's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing is fully accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). For more informa-tion, visit nursing.fau.edu.

I've worked alongside nurse innovators like Bowles and have seen them create or improve processes and solutions to improve patient care experience and health out-comes at lower costs. Too often, stakeholders in the health system leave nurses com-pletely out of the process\u2014and much to their own detriment. That's why , BDO embarked on a mission with Penn Nursing to survey clinical and business leader stakeholders on how they're elevating nurse innovators today\u2014and where they hope to get the most value from them by 2025. We found that though both clinical and business leaders value the innovation and clinical acumen skills nurses bring to their organizations at most levels, they don't yet value them fully at the highest leadership levels. Changing that is a care imperative and business imperative. Read \"Unleashing Nurse-Led Innovation\" where we outline how health systems and businesses can do so. Visit www.bdo.com/healthcare.

As part of its strategic plan, Jupiter Medical Center launched a new Comprehensive Stroke Center in December, followed by the James J. Felcyn and Louise Brien Felcyn Observation Unit in January . On April 30, the hospital celebrated the opening of its new Mastroianni Family Pediatric Emergency Department. Later this year, the hospital will unveil the Timothy and Jayne Donahue Cardiac Surgery pro-gram; a new five-story patient tower that will include the Level II De George Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the Tansky Concierge Suites, patient rooms and office space; and the Anderson Family Cancer Institute. \"That's a lot happening at once,\" Seeley says. \"Since we're in implementa-tion mode for these projects, we don't want to skip a beat during this transi-tion.\" Both Miller and Seeley have nursing backgrounds. From 2011 to 2018, Seeley was the hospital's chief nursing officer. Prior to joining Jupiter Medical Center, he held numerous executive positions in nursing and patient care services, includ-ing interim CNO at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale. Seeley also served as interim CEO at Jupiter Medical Center nearly two years ago. Miller joined Jupiter Medical Center as chief nursing officer last June. She previ-ously was CNO and vice president of patient care for Sibley Memorial Hospital/Johns Hopkins Medicine, a not-for-profit in Washington, D.C., that is in the Johns Hopkins Health System. She has 28 years of nursing and health care executive experience. It's not difficult for nurses to make the shift from the clinical side to the C-suite, comments Miller. Rather, she looks at it as a journey that for her began many years ago. \"I've been in the C-suite for 18 years and reported to two CEOs who were nurses,\" she says. \"They coached and mentored me throughout my career. Having a clinical background lends cred-ibility to your relationships with physi-cians and team members. It's really been a mindset paradigm shift.\" Seeley notes that as a nurse, one becomes intertwined with most depart-ments throughout the hospital. \"You're dependent on other depart- ments, so you have to have strong work-ing relationships with them to do your job and make sure you are providing the best patient care possible,\" he says. The transition to their roles as co-lead- ers of Jupiter Medical Center has been a seamless one. \"It's important that we keep communi- cation open and collaborate on deci-sions,\" says Seeley . \"We talk on a regular basis about issues and tap into each other about decisions. Most are no-brainers because they are strictly in our specific areas of focus, but since there is a lot of overlap, we want to make sure we are cohesive decision makers.\" Miller says they complement each other well. \"It's been fabulous,\" she says. \"Steve and I meet informally a couple of times a day and formally twice a week. We meet with the senior leadership team formally every week and informally , multiple times a day . The good news is, we are in the same suite and so we are in and out of each other's offices all day .\" For nurses who may be thinking of a career in management, Miller's advice is simple. \"You absolutely must continue your education through advanced degrees,\" she says. \"I would also advise aspiring nurse leaders to hire an executive coach and to meet regularly with a formal men-tor. Also, networking is extremely important, and you need to continue that throughout your career.\" An advanced degree will open more doors, and nurses learn a great deal with the additional training, notes Seeley . \"It will make you a better nurse, whether you want to stay at the bedside or get into a leadership position,\" he says. \"There are tremendous leadership opportunities with the growth of health care, but it is competitive. So, your degrees and education can help.\" Seeley also warns that, while manage- ment and leadership positions can be rewarding, it also pays to be patient. \"You won't get the immediate satisfac- tion that you do when you are taking care of a patient directly , but you can have a much larger and greater impact on more people and patients,\" he says. \"It just takes a little longer to get there. You need more patience when you are in these roles.\" For more information, visit www.jupitermed.com. Cover Story: CNOs with Executive Experience Easily Transition to Interim Co-CEO Role at Jupiter Medical Center Continued from page 1BY VANESSA ORR Nineteen years ago, when the nursing shortage was hitting Florida hard, Baptist Health decided to take action by creating the Baptist Health Nurse Scholars Program. Today , this innovative program\u2014which to date has graduated more than 3,300 nurs-es\u2014is continuing to contribute to building a stable, professional nursing community in South Florida. \"In 2000, as a result of the nursing shortage, Baptist Health partnered with Miami Dade College to offer funding, faculty , and classroom and clinical space for associate degree nursing programs,\" explained Maria A. Suarez, DNP , MSN, ARNP , ACNP-BC, assistant vice president of academic affairs and advanced clinical practice. \"In 2007, the program evolved to begin providing scholar-ships and training for entry-level, bachelor-degree nurses through Barry University and Nova Southeastern as well.\" \"Each year, Baptist Health awards scholarships to approximately 200 nursing stu- dents. In addition to providing scholarships, Baptist Health provides full-time faculty for Miami Dade College, Barry University and Nova Southeastern. Students can apply for scholarships through the program in return for a work com- mitment. The Nurse Scholars Program provides students with an intensive training internship, exposing students to real-life situations and allowing them to work on a dedicated, multidisciplinary team with nursing mentors. \"Through this paid internship, nursing students make an easy transition from a stu- dent nurse to a professional nurse,\" said Suarez. \"They become part of that unit, and often end up working there after they graduate.\" The Nurse Scholars Program provides many advantages for students, such as free tutoring and access to lectures each month, in addition to the curriculum, where stu-dents learn Baptist Health policies, procedures and culture. \"We are committed to the success of each and every nursing scholar,\" said Suarez. Students who want to pursue further education after their four-year commitment and are employed by Baptist Health can apply for scholarships to earn a graduate nursing degree. Since its inception, the Nurse Scholars Program has awarded more than $44 million worth of scholarships. An average of 94 percent of Baptist Health scholars pass their state boards the first time, compared to 87 percent of nursing students nationally and 73 percent statewide. \"The Nurse Scholars Program provides financial assistance to students pursuing a career in nursing who otherwise may not have been able to afford the required edu-cation,\" said Suarez. \"As a result, Baptist Health has access to a consistent pipeline of well-trained nurses who share the same values at the core of its mission.\" T o learn more about the Baptist Health Nurse Scholars Program, visit www.BaptistHealth.net or call (786) 596-4194.

It took 14 years of lobbying for New York to pass this law on December 20, 2017. The BSN-in-10 New York statute requires all nurses to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree within 10 years of receiving their initial RN license. Although New York may be the first state to pass the law , many other states have plans to enact similar legislation. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine reported on the future of nursing, making a strong rec-ommendation that 80 percent of the nursing workforce have a BSN by 2020. Currently , the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that nurs-ing is among the top occupations in terms of job growth. The nursing workforce is expected to grow from 2.71 million in 2014 to 3.24 million in 2024, an increase of 439,000 or 16%. Approximately 60% of U.S. nurses have BSN degrees. Florida has the educational infrastructure to support a BSN-in-10 legislative initiative. Many Florida schools offer-ing ASN programs also offer BSN programs. These schools are re-designing their ASN to BSN programs in order to facil-itate the academic progression of ASN students who wish to earn a BSN degree. Florida schools offer RN to BSN pro-grams specially designed for working nurses through online programs. Most of these online programs can be completed in about a year of full-time study to two years of part-time study . Employers offer tuition reimbursement as an incen-tive for ASN nurses to pursue their BSN degree. A BSN degree opens the door to better salaries, marketability , profession-al advancement, and greater job satisfac-tion. Professional nursing organizations such as the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), are push-ing for the BSN degree. They view nurses as the heart of professional collaborative practice, maintaining 24/7 continuity in the day-to-day care of patients. Nurses are not only direct care givers but are managers and coordinators of care. In these roles, nurses work with physicians, pharmacists, social workers, physical therapists, diet therapists, spiritual advisers, and other members of the health care team, most of whom are required to have educational credentials that go beyond the bachelor's degree. Thus, the call for nurses to have a mini-mum of a BSN degree for nursing licensure in Florida, is a fitting salute not only to Florida nurses but to the 3.6 mil-lion nurses in the U.S. A member of the Broward County Bar Association, Dr. Linda Simunek is Associate Dean and Professor of Nursing at Broward College and has served in the Florida Board of Nursing She may be reached at lsimunek@broward.edu and at (954) 201-4880.

BUSINESS/RESOURCE DIRECTORY Broward College President Gregory Adam Haile, Esq., was formally installed as the institution's seventh president during an investiture cere- mony on March 29. During his investiture speech, President Haile announced the launch of Broward UP, a community-centric program designed to improve the quality of life for residents in zip codes with little exposure to postsecondary opportunities. The announcement culminat-ed with a personal commitment of $100,000 from President Haile, his wife Chae Haile, and his two daughters. While Broward County's unemployment rate is approximately 3.8 per- cent, it soars to an average of more than 10 percent in the areas targeted by Broward UP, with some zip codes reaching unemployment levels nearing 15 percent. Through Broward UP, which stands for \"unlimited potential,\" the College has partnered with more than a dozen community organizations to help residents in these communities access programs that will lead to meaningful careers. \"We believe that every individual and every community in our county has Unlimited Potential,\" said President Haile. \"We are committed to developing com-munity partnerships in which we can leverage our resources to improve the quality of life starting with communities in zip codes with high unemployment and where relatively few people attain certificates and degrees. These are our Broward UP communities. These are the com-munities with Unlimited Potential.\" To tap Unlimited Potential, Broward UP focuses on student success, including tutoring, career counseling, social and family services; out-reach to promote student awareness and enrollment; and program, course offerings covering expenses related to faculty , curriculum, materi-als, space and equipment. Before his presidential appointment in July 2018, President Haile served as Broward College's general counsel and vice president of public policy and government affairs. A public servant, community leader, and accomplished educator, he has served on more than 35 boards and com-mittees. He has also repeatedly spent time in Cambridge Massachusetts to teach a self-designed, 4-credit course titled Higher Education Law and Policy at Harvard (Summer School).

DATEBOOKDATEBOOK E-mail Your Calendar Submissions to editorial@ southfloridahospitalnews.comThose of us charged with improving the health and well-being of people and communities across America are navigat-ing what I'd call a \"new era\" in health care, a critical crossroad between innova-tion and a new way of thinking that has us looking at the root causes behind what ails us as a nation. In doing so, many working the front lines of health have reached a consensus: we cannot do it alone. Health is intrinsically tied to too many other factors \u2014 how we live, work and play to name just a few \u2014 and solu-tions must start prior to a patient receiv-ing clinical care. Three years ago, admin-istrators at a Chicago medical system came to this same conclusion and took a bold step. Rush University Medical Center had been growing increasingly frustrated that efforts to address deep health disparities among certain residents were proving ineffective: for a staggering 70 years, the average life expectancy in low-income neighborhoods was 69, while in wealthi-er neighborhoods just a few miles away it was 85. Nothing they'd done \u2014 not the educational and community programs nor the interventions \u2014 chiseled away at that nagging statistic. It was time to take a different approach: they adopted an \"anchor mission,\" using the hospital as a powerful economic engine that could invest its resources into its surrounding community . Rush invested in the every-day factors that profoundly impact opportunities people have (or don't have) to make healthy choices, even more so than their ability to access a doc-tor: job training and education, contracts for local small businesses, and nearby affordable housing developments. Soon after, they recruited other local hospitals, government agencies and nonprofits to join the anchor institution effort. Propelled by this new purpose, the Rush administrators and their colleagues gave themselves an audacious goal: by the year 2030, cut in half the disparity gap that had for so long dodged them. They're still on their way to doing that, of course, but what's most encouraging is they're not alone on the journey . In fact, Rush is among a growing number of health systems nationwide taking on similar economic development chal-lenges, with the clear understanding that it is impossible to improve health with-out first building wealth and opportuni-ty , especially for people who for too long have lacked both. This year, South Florida is joining those ranks with the launch of the South Florida Anchor Alliance, a collaborative of regional institutions \u2014 hospitals and healthcare systems, education enterpris-es and municipalities \u2014 that will come together to harness their collective multi-billion-dollar spending power and vast human and intellectual capital in order to create a more just and inclusive local economy . Health Foundation of South Florida is leading the effort as the initia-tive's backbone organization, thanks to support from our partners at Citi Community Development. Already , a number of regional institutions are actively engaged in exploring how to partner with the Alliance. You might wonder how exactly a hos- pital would \u2014 or could \u2014 go outside the traditional boundaries of its medical services to affect something as broad and encompassing as a complex local econo-my . In South Florida, across Miami-Dade and Broward counties alone, public and non-profit educational and health insti-tutions spend $3.7 billion a year procur-ing goods and services. Only a small per-centage of that goes to small, locally and minority-owned businesses, especially those operating in historically under-rep-resented communities. Imagine what could happen if just a small percentage of that overall spend was shifted to benefit the local economy? As has happened in other cities \u2014 such as Cleveland, where similar efforts were pioneered more than a decade ago by the area's world-renown medical institutions \u2014 it would infuse entire sectors of our community with unprecedented capital, and it would fuel community transformation. The true power of the South Florida Anchor Alliance lies in its members com-ing together to take action. While indi-vidual institutions can and do have exist-ing initiatives and programs that benefit the communities in which they operate, it's when they join forces to address iden-tified opportunities that they are able to accomplish much more. Collectively , they can scale existing efforts and increase impact. They can lend their voice to an intentional conversation focusing specifically on efforts to improve health outcomes and leverage new opportunities and resources exclu-sively available for collective action mod-els. Ultimately , they will gain the recogni-tion they deserve for being leaders at the forefront of a movement to make our region healthier, stronger and more resilient. Now , as Health Foundation of South Florida makes plans to hold the first Anchor Alliance convening this fall, where our charter members will begin to design an actionable blueprint together, we are driven by a simple, but powerful belief: that everyone in South Florida should have the opportunity to lead a prosperous and healthy life, with access to good health care, nutrition, education, employment and housing. We look for-ward to you joining us in this effort. Dr. Janisse Schoepp is the Vice President of Operations and Strategy at the Health Foundation of South Florida.

When most people think of legal medical or recre-ational cannabis, images of greenhouses and dispensaries typically come to mind. However, the ever-evolving cannabis industry requires the assistance of multiple ancillary business that are not necessarily specific to cannabis. Think of what is needed to create a sustainable marketplace for marijuana. It requires agricultural efforts, engineering, seed to sale soft-ware, realty services, logistic specialists, attorneys, physi-cians, packaging and labeling companies, security installation and personnel, human resources, media relations, branding, marketing, public relations, and advocacy, to name a few. http://www.CannaBusinessManagement.com jwhite@CannaBusinessManagement.com Construction, Design, Project Management S.R.

(\"SBI\"), into an independent, publicly-traded company (the \"Spin-off\"). Upon closing of the Spin-off, which is expected to occur on or before September 30, 2019, SOL shareholders will own shares of both companies. In connection with the Spin-off, SBI will be renamed \"Impact Biosciences Corp\" (\"Impact\") and will continue to pursue a drug development in the United States for the treatment of concussions and traumatic brain injury with its pro-prietary Cannabinoid combination drug candidate, which is being developed under contract with the University of Miami. Impact's mission is to become the first accepted drug regimen for concus-sive treatment. Impact has a collabora-tion with the University of Miami and its world-renowned neuroscientific team to conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials of its drug regimen. Impact's Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Combination Therapy is currently in the pre-clinical research phase and is under-going animal testing. Upon completion of this pre-clinical phase and applicable IND enabling studies, Impact will pre-pare and file an investigational new drug (\"IND\") application with the FDA, which, if granted, would permit Impact to begin human testing. Impact has applied for two patents related to its TBI treatment strategy , involving the combination of multiple chemical pathways into a therapeutic regimen targeted at reducing post-injury inflammation and inhibiting the result-ant gliosis and the immune cascade. Impact has found a unique way to apply several pre-existing drugs in a way not previously done to target these processes. Jonathan Gilbert, a cannabis industry veteran, and founder and former CEO of SOL, has agreed to join Impact as President effective with today's announcement. Mr. Gilbert founded SBI in 2014 and was one of the early pioneers in the sector. Mr. Gilbert's experience will be of great value as he embarks on this next important venture. In addition to his prior experience with SOL, Mr. Gilbert currently serves as Executive Chairman of Exactus, Inc. (OTCQB: EXDI), a healthcare company pursuing opportunities in hemp-derived CBD. \"We believe this transaction will unlock value for all of our current SOL shareholders and also remains consistent with SOL's investment strategy in the cannabis space. We welcome Jonathan back and are in full support of his effort to lead our spinoff of Scythian Biosciences into an independent, research-focused entity ,\" said Brady Cobb, CEO of SOL Global. \"We remain dedicated to the critical mission of the University of Miami project, and we believe it is in the best interest of SOL Global shareholders to maintain a large equity position while bringing in other equity partners, due to the sheer size and scope of the research pr ocess.\" \"I am thrilled to be rejoining the team and am excited to get to work on our important drug development program at the University of Miami,\" said Gilbert. \"I believe we can build around Impact's Cannabinoid study by bringing in addi-tional complementary research and drug development opportunities that mitigate risk and add value and growth potential to our company . Research on our combination drug reg- imen - which has been ongoing for over two years at the University of Miami - has shown promising results, and we are now in discussions with a clinical site as well as with CROs and CMOs to initiate a Phase II human trial in Israel. Positive efficacy results from such a trial would put us in a strong position to finally be able to provide substantial relief to those suffering from concussions and other head trauma.\" As a condition to the completion of the Spin-off, SBI intends to issue and sell subscription receipts, or such other class of securities of SBI, on a brokered, pri-vate placement basis subject to terms and conditions to be determined by SBI, the net proceeds of which will be used to fund the Spin-off (the \"SBI Private Placement\"). SBI intends that the securities will be offered and sold in Canada, the United States and such other jurisdictions in accordance with applicable exemptions from prospectus and registration require-ments. Completion of the Spin-off is subject to a number of conditions, including the successful completion of the SBI Private Placement, approval from all applicable regulatory authorities and approval of the listing of Impact's shares on a recog-nized Canadian stock exchange. SOL intends to maintain a material invest-ment in Impact and provide Impact with ongoing support following the closing of the Spin-off. There can be no assurance regarding the timing or completion of the Spin-off.

Trulieve's plants are hand-grown in an environment specially designed to reduce unwanted chemicals and pests, keeping the process as natural as possible at every turn. Like others who have dedicated their careers to working in the cannabis indus-try , Walker has a personal stake in it. When she was in college, her stepdad was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer. In addition to brain surgery , chemo and clin-ical trials, Walker and her family re-searched many other natural therapies. \"I can't even imagine what having safe, legal access to cannabis could have done for him,\" she says. Unfortunately , he only lived one year after diagnosis. This past year, Walker lost another close family friend to cancer. Cannabis was available in the state where she lived but still refused to try it. \"For me, I have two critical goals that are in the back of my mind everyday\u2014to help make cannabis accessible and edu-cate people on the benefits so they become comfortable considering it as an option for treatment,\" Walker says. \"Most of our employees have similar stories that drive them to be a part of this industry .\" Trulieve currently has 27 stores, six in the South Florida area and is aggressively continuing to build out stores to support its rapidly growing patient base. One of Walker's favorite initiatives at Trulieve is its \"TruStory\" testimonials where patients tell others about their experience using cannabis and how it helped. \"I hope there are so many TruStories someday that YouT ube can't hold them all!\" she says. \"The more people who hear firsthand accounts of the benefits of cannabis, the more successful we will be making an impact.\" For more information, visit www.trulieve.com.Back Cover Story: Trulieve \u2014 Providing Natural Relief Continued from back page. Cannabis News Florida cannabisnewsflorida.com May 2019 49\"I knew medical marijuana would be one of the fastest growing industries with a wide range of impacts to existing legal practice areas, so I was interested from a business and academic perspective,\" she recalls. As a land use attorney , Tedrow was already used to representing clients' con-troversial development projects that drew opposition from the community . With medical marijuana dispensary approvals, that dynamic was no different, she notes. \"I've never shied away from engaging on controversial issues that I believed would significantly benefit our commu-nity and knew the key to getting every-one to embrace medical marijuana busi-nesses was compassion and education,\" she says. \"It's been a pleasure ever since to work with clients in this industry and help move the needle forward in the medical community .\" One key factor that distinguishes Lowndes from others that offer similar services is value, according to Tedrow. \"Our firm brings an incredible value to our clients,\" she says. \"We represented the first medical marijuana dispensary in the state of Florida and our experience representing cannabis businesses from seed to sale provides a solid platform for us to assist clients in navigating the busi-ness, regulatory and legal complexities facing this emerging market.\" She adds that her firm also truly understands its clients' businesses and the intricate details of their operations. For example, \"it's not enough to just know that your client cultivates marijua-na indoors pursuant to state law ,\" she says. \"You need to understand the specific technology utilized for their grow opera-tions, be able to predict problems they may face because of their operational model and to provide referrals to outside industry experts who can assist if prob-lems arise,\" Tedrow says. \"Having taught the first Marijuana Law and Policy course at the University of Florida Fredric G. Levin College of Law , I have a deep understanding of this area and have been able to work with incredible thought and industry leaders from around the country . The network of referrals and advice our firm provides to clients helps to reduce costs and increase efficiency , both critical components in an increasingly competitive market.\" There are still some legal struggles faced by marijuana businesses in the state of Florida. Putting aside the obvi-ous struggles caused by existing anti-quated federal regulations of medical marijuana, simple operational issues arise for cannabis businesses that other companies don't face. \"From IRS 280E provisions prohibiting the deduction of certain operating expens-es for tax purposes, to the inability to obtain title insurance on properties intended to be used for marijuana opera-tions, these businesses face unique chal-lenges every day ,\" says Tedrow. \"Until there are sustainable solutions for issues such as banking, financing and payment options, medical marijuana companies will continue to face unnecessary hurdles to growth and productivity .\" For more information, visit https://lowndes-law.com/services- and-industries/industries/cannabis-and- controlled-substances/ Back Cover Story: Florida Law Firm Provides Guidance for Cannabis Companies to Navigate Regulatory Complexities Continued from 6 5 \u0018 \u0011 Q L D J , D V X V W H U D H U H K 7 O L U K W P , \\ \u0011 V V H F F X V R W V V H Q L 2 ) & G H F U X R V W X R G U X 2 \u0011 W V X U W Q D F X R \\ W / H K W X R \\ H Y L J V H F L Y Y H V U Q Q D O S [ [ W D \u000f J Q L W Q X R F F D Q L G H W W O X J H U \u0010 \\ O K J L K D Q , D U K O O : G V X E U X R \\ U H H W V R W \\ \\ L U X F H V H W G Q D \u000f Q R L W D U D S H U S [ [ W D \u000f J Q L Q U H Q W U D S D G H H Q X R \\ \\ \\ W V X G Q U P H K W I R H Q R W R Q H H 7 R F \u0011 N F L V X U N V V R P \u0011 Z Z Z W V H K W H Y Y H / D R F \u0011 N F L V X U N V V R P # R I Q L D H % P O D 3 _ R G Q D O O R W \u001b \u0015 \u001b \u0015 \u0017 R W $ $ 0 .

It also integrates and scales with different systems, including state monitoring systems.\" An added advantage is that the software is built around a set of controls that protect licensees from making mistakes. \"It is geared to drive a licensee down a specific workflow in order to keep the data clean,\" said Dr. Afaneh, adding that security con-trols also prevent the addition of dummy data or others breach-ing the system. Government Solutions Dr. Afaneh first came up with the concept of the monitoring software after working in the pharmaceutical industry . There, he partnered to launch the company's original venture, BioScriptRX , working on the development of a product to track prescription drugs and methamphetamine precursors. While demonstrating the software to lawmakers, the concept of tracking cannabis was raised, and in 2010, BioTrackTHC was born. The software provides a secure, online traceability portal that provides detailed analytics for regulatory agencies and law enforcement, who can track cannabis transportation and inven-tory in real-time. Lawmakers also receive detailed financial reports, ensuring compliance and adherence to industry stan-dards and state laws. \"We work in a consultative role with state clients, addressing potential issues in advance and guiding them with best prac-tices,\" said Dr. Afaneh. As for the future, since merging with Helix TCS this year, BioTrackTHC is in the process of building the next generation of software, which will include a security grade camera system, access control system, and an analytics dashboard.

The opera-tors were derived from applicants (known in the industry as \"one-point-ers\") originally denied licenses during the first round of licensing in 2015. As a result of this second round, all original applicants are now approved as medical marijuana treatment centers. The new licensees include Inc.; Spring Oaks Greenhouses, Inc.; and Tree King-Tree Farm, Inc. According to Jim McKee, an attorney for Perkins Nursery , Governor DeSantis and the Department of Health have \"resolved significant and expensive liti-gation surrounding the 2015 application process\" through these settlements. The new agreement worked out by Florida Governor DeSantis requires that these new licensees agree \"to provide enhanced patient access by locating a percentage of dispensaries within impov-erished communities and rural areas that have been adversely affected by extraor-dinary economic events or natural disas-ters.\" In addition, all employees are required to undergo more stringent back-ground checks and operators must \"adopt security and anti-diversion poli-cies that are more stringent than required under Florida law.\" Florida Grants Medical Marijuana Licenses to Eight Additional Florida Operators SAVE THE DATE The \"Lift the Banned\" T our Presented by Trulieve Is Heading to North Florida in May!

Well, it's not that simple for those on the cusp of the cannabis industry boom and there are many legitimate reasons to contact a trust-ed CPA firm. Experienced in accounting, tax, audit, finance and business operations Moss, Krusick & Associates LLC, (MKA) design and maintain accounting systems that provide valuable management guidelines and keep businesses in compliance with state and federal regulations. Jennifer Aros, Quality Control/Audit Manager, urges cannabis business entre-preneurs in this booming industry where governmental regulations seem to evolve with each business day , to put accounting on the front burner during their business planning and operations phases. \"Seek an experienced accounting firm that is will-ing to work in the cannabis market to ensure expert advice on reporting obliga-tions and tax liabilities - sooner rather than later,\" she advises. MKA, a boutique firm well established in the state of Florida, is knowledgeable about standards in the non-profit, govern-ment, real estate and medical professional niches and can contrast the similarities and unique differences from the cannabis industry . As one of the pioneer firms serv-ing Florida cannabis clients, they are a member of the BDO Alliance, USA, BDO is the 5th largest accounting firm nation-wide, which backs MKA with the acumen of a network of professionals, which includes firms who are in front of the curve of the cannabis industry . Unique to the cannabis industry is a base of contradictory laws and regulations between state and federal rules. This pres-ents difficult challenges in banking and tax liabilities for the industry , for instance. While there is still a national hesitancy within the banking industry to work with the cannabis industry , this is a positive opportunity for local Florida banks. MKA brings a referral database of knowledge-able banking, legal and other professionals to support cannabis entrepreneurs from the start. According to Ms. Aros, it is vital to work with an accounting firm that not only has experience in the accounting world but also the bold self-assurance to participate in the unique challenges of the cannabis industry . In order to engage in the market, MKA keeps abreast of constant changes and contradictions between state and fed-eral laws and the impact on accounting procedures. As one of the few Florida accounting firms willing to tally cannabis clients in their portfolio, MKA is involved in many aspects of the cannabis-related enterprises from conducting inventory observations, full inventory counts for companies, to recommending related pro-fessionals to provide guidance in navigat-ing new waters. Florida is poised to be among the most highly regulated states in the U.S. so MKA staff is involved with on-going educational programs to be aware of the specific laws, guidelines and restrictions that the state of Florida has recommended. Detailed recordkeeping can put extra strain on small business owners but is a vital requirement. MKA can customize a process to meet client needs whether that requires day-to-day management of the business accounting function or assistance through a temporary crisis. MKA client services can staff for daily accounting functions, monthly financials, and year-end activities to enable clients to spend more time building the business and less on bookkeeping, recordkeeping and report filing. Experienced accounting professionals work on recordkeeping and help navigate robust rules and regulations which is vital to assure compliance from the ground floor. In 2018, Florida elected a new Commissioner of Agriculture who is tack-ling the confusion over medical marijuana regulations with the creation of a Director of Cannabis position. The position will provide a knowledgeable formal govern-mental liaison to share information, high-light issues and participate in solutions to insure a safe, robust market. As activists, politicians, business profes- sionals, investors, law enforcement, clini-cians and patients engage in the cannabis industry , the debate over cannabis remains heated but promises to lend clarity and credibility to diminish some of the social and cultural stigmas. There may be further revolutionary changes in the landscape and one can anticipate the ancillary indus-try will continue to grow. Skilled profes-sional accountants can help position their clients with useful management tools to make business decisions that will sustain profitability during the inevitable turbu-lence of this new and unique industry growth curve.

What benefits do you see for patients through- out Florida within this space? Giving patients the option to experience natural relief without fear of governmental overreach is a must for our beautiful state. I feel strongly that Florida should lead the way out of the opiate epidemic. Statistically speaking, Florida holds an incredible amount of responsibility for the opiate crisis in our country and allowing cannabis to be used freely as risk reduction therapy is imperative. What motivates you to be a part of the Cannabis Industry? I am a relatively new cannabis patient myself. I voted for medical marijuana as a resident of California in 1996, but I had only purchased marijuana once in my life. Upon being recommended medical marijuana under the table by my then specialist in Jacksonville 5 years ago, it took me three months to even try using it because I just did not believe it would be able to help me. I was 43 and weary . It has changed my life in such an amazing way that I feel absolutely compelled to help as many patients as possible. What field are you in within the Cannabis space? I founded and am the Executive Director for Buds for Vets, Inc. a Florida nonprofit. How can people in Florida benefit from the company you represent? We have been very fortunate to partner with medical marijuana doctors all over the state who provide free first time MMJ patient appointments to our pre-qualified veterans who are rated 70% disabled or higher. We are actually cele-brating 500 Veterans served this month! How did you get started within the cannabis industry? I am the daughter of a Vietnam era Combat Marine and the sister of an Army Special Ops Veteran and was medically ineligible for service myself. I had my first ovarian cyst rupture at 17 and by 19 I was diagnosed with PTSD. I struggled with night terrors and debilitat-ed panic attacks, GAD (general anxiety disorder) and insomnia until finding cannabis and I realized that though I could not serve my country in the same way as my dad or brother, I could help my Veteran brothers and sisters who are suffering. Are you personally a MJ card holder? Yes absolutely . Do you see Florida moving forward with recreational Marijuana/Cannabis and how will that affect your business? I am not focused on recreational cannabis at this time. My priority is patient access which has a long way to go here in Florida. It is of utmost importance to me that our veterans are allowed affordable access and our current system is absolutely unaffordable for most of our neediest veterans. We believe being able to grow your own cannabis flower is a natural right and if our government can entrust our military men and women to protect our country , they absolutely should be entrusted with growing a few cannabis plants for their personal medicine. I will not rest until this is a real-ity here in Florida. I do have some fun ideas in the works for cannabis tourism businesses once legal. I live in not only the most beautiful town in Florida, but the old-est city in the country and cannot wait for tourists to experience St. Augustine while elevated!

Tedrow believes that Florida can be a good model for emerging marijuana markets. One of the reasons is that the robust regulatory standards in place have helped minimize many of the mistakes other states made in failing to regulate more on the front end. \"Though the state's delays in licensing new companies has stymied the industry's growth, Florida has also shown why ensuring strict standards for operating a business can better protect product quality and patients,\" says Tedrow , shareholder and chair of Cannabis & Controlled Substances Group at Lowndes, a large law firm headquartered in Orlando, FL. \"I am hopeful that between Governor [Ron] DeSantis and FDACS Commissioner [Nicole] Fried, Florida will be one of the strongest cannabis markets in the U.S.\" The Cannabis & Controlled Substances Group at Lowndes provides support and guidance to companies, individuals, and investors who are engaged in or considering entry into the cannabis market. Clients of Tedrow's firm include businesses involved in the cultivation, processing, distribution, and dis-pensing of cannabis across the U.S. and abroad. \"We advise clients on the wide range of legal, business and public policy issues surrounding the cannabis industry , as well as questions about entity formation, supply agreements, investments, land use and permitting, environ-mental compliance, regulatory compliance, intellectual property , real estate, employment contracts and policies, and non-disclosure and confidentiality issues,\" she says. Lowndes' attorneys have handled hundreds of mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, public debt placements, balance sheet and asset-based financings, and cross-border trans-actions. Some have served as general counsel to public and private companies and many have appeared before administrative and regu- latory agencies at local, state and federal levels. \"Our team brings together a diverse group of lawyers to address many business issues in the medical cannabis indus-try ,\" says Tedrow. Tedrow was first hired by one of the original medical mari- juana licensees in Florida to assist in getting their dispensaries approved statewide. From there, her career in medical marijua-na took off. Florida Law Firm Provides Guidance for Cannabis Companies to Navigate Regulatory Complexities Continued on page 49 M AY 2019 T ara L. T edrow T rulieve \u2014 Providing Natural Relief BY DANIEL CASCIATO After it was awarded the first license in the state of Florida following Florida vot-ers' supermajority approval of Amendment 2 in 2016, Trulieve immedi-ately hit the ground running and hasn't stopped. \"Trulieve has a passion and responsibil- ity to grow as quickly as possible which has been our focus over the last three years,\" says Victoria Walker, director of marketing and community relations for the medical marijuana company . Last month, Trulieve also became the first in the state to sell smokable cannabis legally . It will offer smokable flower buds in several strains and plans to expand its offerings to including pre-rolled marijua-na. Patients with smokable cannabis on their recommendations will be allowed to be dispensed up to 2.5 oz every 35 days. In addition, patients with smokable cannabis recommendations may possess up to 4 oz of cannabis flower at one time. The company has 1,500 employees ded- icated to serving the patients of Florida. Walker notes that it provides the highest quality medication backed by transparent 3rd party lab reports. \"We offer the most innovative and largest variety of medication to serve all patient needs,\" she says. \"Patient access is critical which drives us to quickly expand locations and offer next day home delivery .\" Its products are designed to alleviate seizures, severe and persistent muscle spasms, pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and other symptoms associated with serious medical conditions such as cancer. In Victoria Walker Continued on page 48 MOSS, KRUSICK & ASSOCIATES LLC Accounting Advice from Seed to Sale page 52 BioT rackTHC Provides T ransparent, Customizable Software Solutions for Business, Government Clients BY VANESSA ORR As the cannabis industry has evolved, so has the need for technology to keep track of every-thing from seed to sale. Depending on the state, the reporting requirements and the types of infor-mation that need to be kept can differ widely , which is why it's so important to have a secure, comprehensive, customizable software product to stay compliant. BioTrackTHC offers cannabis licensees all of this and more. For the past 10 years, the compa-ny has been helping growers, manufacturers, and dispensaries track the lifecycle of each plant, sim-plifying record-keeping, and in turn optimizing future yields and sales. It also provides software tracking solutions to government clients, ensuring that law enforcement agencies can enforce requirements, collect taxes and prevent illegal activities. Business Solutions According to BioTrackTHC COO Dr. Moe Afaneh, there are many advantages for businesses that use the software, which cov-ers cultivation operations, processing and manufacturing, and dis-pensing at the point of sale. \"Our flexible software accommodates all different types of workflows, tracking all seeds, clones and tissues until the inven-tory is transformed into oil or another final prod- uct,\" he explained, adding that the technology was created by growers for growers. \"Our software is designed for the way that growers think,\" added Dr. Afaneh, who traveled to Colorado to research the industry before launch-ing the product. \"We not only have a true insight and understanding of the growing process itself, but also the regulatory side, compliance, enforce-ment, and everything that goes into the business side of the license.\" The software program assigns a unique 16-digit identifier to each plant or clone that records and archives plant phases, additives and employee interactions to ensure accountability . After the plant is harvested, the batched material receives a new 16-digit identifier that contains the plant's history since prop-agation. Test results, including potency , are automatically assigned and printed on product labels, and a detailed manifest is created before the product is transported, displaying the entire chain of custody .
