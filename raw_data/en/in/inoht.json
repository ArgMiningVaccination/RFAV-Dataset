Most infections occur after eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Some types of Vibrio cause skin infections when an open wound is exposed to salt water or brackish water. Individuals with immunocompromising conditions or chronic liver disease are most likely to be infected with Vibrio. Eating raw seafood and coming into contact with salt water or brackish water can increase the likelihood of acquiring the disease. Symptoms of vibriosis acquired through ingestion may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Symptoms typically begin within 24 hours of ingestion. Most mild cases recover within three days. However, severe cases may require hospitalization. Symptoms of vibriosis acquired through wounds may include fever, redness, pain, swelling, warmth, discoloration, and discharge. As of September 5, 2023, there have been 12 reported probable and confirmed cases of vibriosis in Maine residents this year. The majority of vibriosis cases are reported in the summer and fall months when the coastal waters are warmer. | | ||September 6, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11800863&an=1) |Particle pollution concentrations are expected to reach \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" (USG) level Wednesday September 6th, according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). A dense ground-level plume of smoke from fires in Canada moved into Maine last night. For today, the 24-hour average is expected to be in the USG range for the northern region. For the remainder of the state, the 24-hour average is expected to be Moderate with only a few hours above Moderate. In addition, temperatures across the state are unseasonably warm, which could present additional risk to those spending time outdoors. At elevated particle pollution levels, children, healthy adults who exert themselves, and individuals suffering from a respiratory disease such as asthma, bronchitis or COPD can experience reduced lung function and irritation. When this happens, individuals may notice a shortness of breath, coughing, throat irritation, and/or experience an uncomfortable sensation in their chest. Additionally, those with a heart disease should also follow these recommendations.| | ||August 29, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11737958&an=1) |Please review this information from U.S. CDC on malaria acquired in the United States. In addition to the clinical resources available here, you can also learn more about the clinical management of malaria from the recent U.S. CDC Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) call held on July 20, 2023. A recording of that webinar is available at |[https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2023/callinfo_072023.asp.](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2023/callinfo_072023.asp.) In Maine, Anopheles mosquito vectors are present. While the risk in Maine remains low, it is possible for local mosquitoes to acquire Plasmodium spp. parasites from an infected person and transmit the parasites to a susceptible, non-infected person. Providers should consider a malaria diagnosis in patients with unexplained febrile illnesses, particularly patients returning from areas with local malaria transmission. Confirmed and suspected patients with malaria should be reported to Maine CDC. Providers with questions about malaria diagnosis and treatment can call the U.S. CDC Malaria Hotline at 770-488-7788.

The acute signs and symptoms of smoke exposure can include headache, eye and mucous membrane irritation, dyspnea (trouble breathing), cough, wheezing, chest pain, palpitations, and fatigue. Wildfire smoke exposure may exacerbate respiratory, metabolic, and cardiovascular chronic conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure.| | ||June 30, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11377370&an=1) |Please review this helpful information about domestic acquisition of malaria in the U.S. in recent months, risks of acquisition of malaria in the U.S. with increased international travel, and the need to plan for testing and treatment of patients with malaria. In Maine, Anopheles mosquito vectors are present. While the risk in Maine remains low, it is possible for local mosquitoes to acquire Plasmodium spp. parasites from an infected person and transmit the parasite to a susceptible, non-infected person. Providers should encourage confirmed and suspected patients with malaria to avoid activities that would put them in contact with local mosquitoes. The above average rainfall in the previous weeks increases the chance of a potentially more robust mosquito season. Providers should remain vigilant throughout the year for potential cases. All confirmed and suspected patients with malaria must be reported to Maine CDC by electronic laboratory reporting, fax at 800-293-7534, or by phone at 800-821-5821. | | ||June 24, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11322861&an=1) |Particle pollution concentrations are expected to reach Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups level Sunday according to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). A cold front is dropping down out of Canada bringing smoke from the fires in Quebec with it. Smoke will begin to move into the northern region after midnight Saturday night. It is expected to move south and west during the day on Sunday. The likelihood is that areas of Maine away from the coast will have some degree of smoke and it may be heavy at times. The Coast has the potential to reach the Moderate range on the Air Quality Index. Monday's forecast is predicted to be Moderate for particle pollution due to the fact that smoke can take some time to clear out.| | ||June 8, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11179217&an=1) |Maine is seeing early signs of an active animal rabies season this year. In the first five months of 2023, 30 animals tested positive for rabies in Maine compared to 11 animals in the first five months of 2022. Some regions in Cumberland County are already seeing elevated animal rabies activity compared to this same time last year, including 11 confirmed cases of rabies in raccoons and skunks tested after encounters with humans or domestic animals. The purpose of this health advisory is to alert clinicians to the increased risk of rabies exposures and provide recommendations. Individuals exposed to rabid or potentially rabid animals should be evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine if rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), is warranted. Remember, rabies is virtually 100% fatal, but also entirely preventable.| | ||June 2, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11126209&an=1) |The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update to supplement the U.S. CDC HAN Health Advisory issued on May 17, 2023.

The smoke has moved into the Gulf of Maine where winds from a small High-Pressure system combined with an afternoon sea breeze are expected to bring the smoke ashore in Maine during the afternoon to evening hours. The plume of smoke is expected to move inland overnight. While there could be a few hours with higher levels of particle pollution it is expected that the 24-hour average will not rise above the moderate range on the Air Quality Index. Skies will be hazy; visibility may be reduced and the odor of smoke is likely to be apparent.| | ||May 22, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=11050514&an=1) |COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have decreased substantially in recent months. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate worldwide and new variants are expected to continue to appear. Vaccines continue to provide the best protection against infection and severe illness. Medications that reduce progression to severe disease are widely available for people at highest risk for severe disease. The U.S. Public Health Emergency ended on May 11, 2023, resulting in changes to reporting requirements and availability of certain metrics guiding certain healthcare infection control and individual- and community-level prevention practices.

This is the first isolate identified in the U.S. showing resistance or reduced susceptibility to all drugs that are recommended for treatment. This strain has the same sequence type recently identified in the United Kingdom and previously reported as circulating in Asia-Pacific countries. Identification of this novel strain is a reminder that N. gonorrhoeae is becoming less responsive to a limited arsenal of antibiotics. While no cases of this novel strain have been reported in Maine as of today's date, gonorrhea continues to be a concern, with cases rising nationally and in Maine. Cases of gonorrhea in Maine increased 34% between 2021 (n=462) and 2022 (n=620). In 2022, rates of gonorrhea were highest for Black and African Americans, males, and persons aged 15-34 years; one-third of cases reported male-to-male sexual contact (2022 data as of February 2, 2023).

From 2012 through 2021, the rate of syphilis cases increased by 224% in the U.S. and by 405% in Maine. In 2022, 112 cases of syphilis were reported in Maine, 20.5% of whom were women between the ages of 15 and 44 years (preliminary data). Maine CDC recently received notification of a case of probable congenital syphilis (CS). This is the first case of CS reported in a Maine resident in nearly 30 years. In 2021, there were 2,677 cases of CS reported in the U.S., an increase of 702% from 2012. In 2021, the highest rates of CS were among birthing persons who were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (364 cases per 100,000 live births), non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (221 cases per 100,000 live births), and non-Hispanic Black or African American (153 cases per 100,000 live births). CS occurs when a pregnant person with syphilis passes the infection to the fetus during pregnancy. This can happen during any stage of syphilis and any trimester of pregnancy; the risk of transmission is highest if the pregnant person has been infected recently. Approximately 40% of babies born to persons with untreated syphilis can be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn. CS can lead to preterm labor and newborn/childhood illness teeth, and bones; blindness; and deafness. Adequate and timely treatment of syphilis in pregnant persons is 98% effective in preventing CS. During 2017 through 2021, the majority of missed prevention opportunities among persons delivering babies with CS in the U.S. were those with no timely prenatal care or syphilis testing (38% of cases) and those with timely syphilis testing but no adequate treatment of the pregnant person (34% of cases). | | ||January 5, 2023 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=10047616&an=1) |The United States has seen a rise in invasive Group A Streptococcal infections.

RVs and EVs can have clinically similar presentations and are indistinguishable from one another on multiplex assays often used in clinical settings. Upon further typing, some specimens have been positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Concurrently, pediatric acute respiratory illness sentinel surveillance sites are reporting a higher proportion of EV-D68 positivity in children who are RV/EV positive compared to previous years. Although it primarily causes acute respiratory illness, EV-D68 has been associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare but serious neurologic complication involving limb weakness. The purpose of this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory is to 1. Notify healthcare providers, laboratories, infection control specialists, and public health departments about recent increases in severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization in children, 2. Urge healthcare providers to consider EV-D68 as a possible cause of acute, severe respiratory illness (with or without fever) in children, 3. Advise of the potential for an increase in AFM cases in the upcoming weeks, and 4.

Maine CDC is requesting that laboratories send respiratory specimens from influenza confirmed or suspect patients to Maine's Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL) for subtyping, especially in the beginning of influenza season. Subtyping allows Maine CDC to determine which influenza viruses are circulating this season and detect novel influenza virus infections. Novel influenza A viruses cause human infection but are different from current seasonal human influenza A viruses that circulate among people. In August 2022, U.S. CDC reported 5 cases of human variant virus infection, or viruses that typically circulate in swine, and avian influenza H5N1 continues to circulate in wild and domestic birds. Though the risk to humans remains low, healthcare providers should be aware and test symptomatic patients with risk factors such as swine, agriculture, and avian exposures for influenza. HETL is the only laboratory in Maine that can identify novel influenza, therefore, all influenza A positive specimens from people with these exposures should be sent to HETL for further evaluation. | | ||September 7, 2022 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=8803484&an=1) |The global outbreak of monkeypox continues to grow in Maine and across the United States. Most cases have been identified in urban areas in other states. More cases are expected in Maine. Nationwide, the outbreak remains largely confined to gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men and transgender, gender non-conforming, or non-binary individuals who have sex with men, although some infections have been identified in other people. This health advisory provides updates on three key areas for clinicians: testing, vaccination, and reported 63 cases of varicella in Maine residents to Maine CDC, compared to just 33 cases reported in 2020. The decrease in widespread COVID-19 social distancing practices likely played a role in the increase in varicella cases.

Peaks of cases were observed across the United States in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Given the observed biennial pattern, it was anticipated that there would be an increase in AFM cases in 2020; however, cases plateaued from 2019 through 2021. It is likely that methods of prevention for COVID-19 contributed to the deviation from the previously observed biennial pattern. AFM is still observed across the country; it is unknown if the biennial pattern will resume. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) reported eight confirmed cases of AFM from January 2022 through June 2022. Enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, are thought to be a likely cause of the condition. AFM is rare in Maine, with four confirmed cases reported since 2014. Common symptoms include respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, rapid onset of limb weakness in one or more limbs (more proximal), loss of muscle tone and reflexes in the affected limb or limbs, facial or eyelid droop and difficulty swallowing or speaking. In severe cases, AFM can lead to respiratory failure or neurologic life-threatening complications. The condition progresses rapidly and can lead to respiratory failure, so early detection and hospitalization are critical. | | ||August 4, 2022 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=8521316&an=1) |As of July 29, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local public health partners are reporting 5,189 cases of Monkeypox virus infections in the United States across 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

Consider testing for Powassan virus year-round. Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEE), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and West Nile virus (WNV) are serious arboviral infections that are transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Maine reported one human case of JCV in 2021. Additionally, Powassan virus (POW) is an arboviral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Maine identified three cases of POW in 2021 and four more cases to date in 2022. Two of the POW cases in 2022 died.

COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021. New variants continue to emerge, some with higher transmissibility and an ability to cause breakthrough infections in those who have been vaccinated and in those with prior COVID-19 infection. Vaccination remains the best protection against infection, hospitalization, and death. Vaccines are available for people 6 months and older and boosters are available for people 5 years and older; additional doses and other pre-exposure prophylaxis for people with moderate/severe immunocompromise. People should keep up to date on COVID-19 vaccination. Getting vaccine doses now will not preclude receiving additional vaccine doses in the fall or beyond. Maine continues to see COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, largely among younger, unvaccinated adults and older, vaccinated adults. In people with mild or moderate COVID-19 illness who are at high risk for severe disease, treatment can sharply reduce the risk of progressing to hospitalization or death. Outpatient treatment of COVID-19 is the standard of care for eligible patients.

In November 2021, clinicians at a large children's hospital in Alabama notified U.S. CDC of five pediatric patients with significant liver injury, including three with acute liver failure, who also tested positive for adenovirus. All children were previously healthy. None had COVID-19. Case-finding efforts at this hospital identified four additional pediatric patients with hepatitis and adenovirus infection for a total of nine patients admitted from October 2021 through February 2022; all five that were sequenced had adenovirus type 41 infection identified. In two patients, plasma samples were negative for adenovirus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), but both patients were positive when retested using whole blood. Two patients required liver transplant; no patients died. A possible association between pediatric hepatitis and adenovirus infection is currently under investigation. Cases of pediatric hepatitis in children who tested negative for hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E were reported earlier this month in the United Kingdom, including some with adenovirus infection. This Health Advisory serves to notify clinicians who may encounter pediatric patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology to consider adenovirus testing and to elicit reporting of such cases to state public health authorities and to U.S. CDC.

Maine CDC identified a human case of Powassan encephalitis in a Maine resident who resides in midcoastal Maine. The individual was symptomatic in late June and hospitalized. CDC Fort Collins confirmed the Powassan result in this individual by neutralization testing. This individual likely acquired this Powassan encephalitis infection in the state of Maine. There are two types of Powassan virus in the United States. The first type, often called lineage 1 Powassan virus is associated with Ixodes cookei or the woodchuck tick. Lineage 2 POW, sometimes called Deer tick virus, is associated with Ixodes scapularis or the deer tick. Both can cause human disease. Powassan encephalitis is a member of the flavivirus genus which includes arboviruses like Dengue virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow Fever virus, and Zika virus. Arboviral diseases, including Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and WNV, are serious infections that are transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Maine reported one human case of WNV in 2020. Additionally, Powassan virus is an arboviral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Maine identified one case of Powassan virus disease in residents during 2020.

The reports appear to be rare, given the number of vaccine doses administered to date. U.S. CDC is investigating whether there is any causal association or an increase of such events relative to the background rates. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is the inflammation of the lining outside the heart. In both cases, the body's immune system causes an inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger. While myocarditis can be serious, it is frequently mild and self-limited.

Maine CDC is not aware of any reports of these cases in Maine residents. The State of Maine is advising that providers pause administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine until the US CDC's scientific advisory committee has further reviewed the safety data. Maine CDC is working with administration partners to provide an alternative supply of the mRNA vaccines to clinics already scheduled so they can continue operations. As of April 12, 2021, approximately 6.85 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen) have been administered in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewing data involving six U.S. cases of a rare type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J COVID-19 vaccine that were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). All six cases occurred among women aged 18-48 years. The interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset ranged from 613 days. One patient died. Providers should maintain a high index of suspension for symptoms that might represent serious thrombotic events or thrombocytopenia in patients who have recently received the J&J COVID-19 vaccine. When these specific type of blood clots are observed following J&J COVID-19 vaccination, treatment is different from the treatment that might typically be administered for blood clots. Based on studies conducted among the patients diagnosed with immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe, the pathogenesis of these rare and unusual adverse events after vaccination may be associated with platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor-4 (PF4), a type of protein. Usually, the anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, the use of heparin may be harmful, and alternative treatments need to be given. CDC will convene an emergency meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday, April 14, 2021, to further review these cases and assess potential implications on vaccine policy. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. Until that process is complete, CDC and FDA are recommending a pause in the use of the J&J COVID-19 vaccine out of an abundance of caution. The purpose of this Health Alert is, in part, to ensure that the healthcare provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can provide proper management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot. | | ||March 24, 2021 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=4351636&an=1) |The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) has identified a case of acute hepatitis A virus infection in an Orono, Maine, food service worker.

Clinicians should ask about and document extent of use, type of instrument used, type of vaping liquid used (i.e. nicotine, THC), place of purchase, and if the patient still has the vaping liquid they used. Clinicians should also complete a respiratory viral panel and test for influenza to rule out a possible viral cause of illness. Reporting: Clinicians should report cases with onset on or after May 1, 2019, that meet the criteria of (1) significant respiratory illness of unclear etiology and (2) a history of vaping. All suspect cases should be reported by phone to Maine CDCs 24/7 disease reporting and consultation line at 1-800-821-5821 or by fax to 1-800-293-7534 using the Disease Reporting Form (attached). Attention: On October 9, 2019, Maine CDC will be hosting a live webinar to discuss pulmonary illness associated with e-cigarette use.

Multiple Maine facilities reported influenza positive lab results in the last week, including a PCR confirmed case, which tested positive for influenza A and was typed at Maine's Health and Environmental Testing Lab (HETL) as influenza A/H3. This individual is an adult who was not hospitalized, was unvaccinated, and had recent travel history. The 2019-2020 influenza season officially begins on September 29, 2019. Individuals should NOT wait to get vaccinated as influenza is already present in the state. Both Influenza A and B strains are currently circulating nationally. The 2019-2020 quadrivalent influenza vaccine contains components of both A strains (H1 and H3) as well as two B strains (Yamagata and Victoria). Quadrivalent vaccine is recommended for optimal protection, however if only trivalent vaccine is available the recommendation is not to wait and obtain the vaccine as soon as possible. | | ||September 23, 2019 || |[Agenda](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1556554&an=1) |The agenda for the upcoming 2019 \"Start of call.| | ||September 20, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1556409&an=1) |The purpose of this health advisory is to alert clinicians to the first case in Maine of severe pulmonary disease linked to e-cigarette product use, or \"vaping\". Clinicians should consider vaping-associated pulmonary illness in the evaluation of patients with significant respiratory illness and a history of vaping. Patients presenting with significant respiratory illness of unclear etiology should be asked about their use of vaping products. For patients who have used vaping products, clinicians should ask about the extent of use, the type of instrument used, the type of vaping liquid used, and the place of purchase. Patients should also be asked if they still have the vaping liquid they used. If so, Maine CDC can assist with arranging laboratory testing of the liquid. Reporting: Maine CDC asks that clinicians report cases that meet the criteria of (1) significant respiratory illness of unclear etiology and (2) a history of vaping. All suspect cases should be reported by phone to Maine CDC's 24/7 disease reporting and consultation line at 1-800-821-5821 or by fax to 1-800-293-7534 using the Disease Reporting Form.| | ||September 3, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1484580&an=1) |The purpose of this health advisory is to alert clinicians to the potential for human Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) disease activity in Maine and to consider testing for EEE in patients presenting with unexplained encephalitis, meningitis or high fever (100.4F or 38C) during the summer and early fall. Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry notified Maine CDC of a case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) in a horse from York County late Friday August 30th. The Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University in New York confirmed the EEE result in this horse. Maine has not detected EEE to date in mosquito collections. However, public health officials in other Northeast states have seen significant increases in EEE activity this year. Massachusetts has reported four human cases and one human death, as well as four animal deaths from EEE. New Hampshire has reported one animal death from EEE. Maine has not identified a human case of EEE since 2015. EEE is a rare, but potentially fatal arboviral disease. It is the most severe arboviral infection found in the United States. EEE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Signs and symptoms can include fever, headache, myalgias, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. In more serious cases, the illness may progress to encephalitis, coma, and death. The case-fatality rate for infected individuals is approximately 33% and up to 50% for those who show symptoms. Most survivors are left with significant and long-term brain damage. Symptoms can begin anytime from four to ten days after the mosquito bite, and usually last one to two weeks. It is possible some people will not show any signs of EEE illness. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe EEE illness often need to be hospitalized. | | ||August 30, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1478127&an=1) |In an ongoing effort to provide the most up-to-date information on respiratory illnesses related to e-cigarette use, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is sharing this advisory from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been no confirmed cases of vaping-related respiratory illness in Maine as of Friday, August 30, 2019. Maine CDC continues to ask that clinicians report cases of severe pulmonary disease of unclear etiology and a history of e-cigarette product use within the past 90 days to Maine CDC's 24/7 disease reporting and consultation line at 1-800-821-5821 or by fax to 1-800-293-7534 using the Disease Reporting Form.| | ||August 21, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1447848&an=1) |The purpose of this health advisory is to alert clinicians to reports of severe pulmonary disease linked to e-cigarette product use, or \"vaping\". As of August 15, 2019, 94 possible cases of severe lung illness associated with vaping have been reported in 14 states since June 28, 2019. Clusters are occurring in multiple states, including Wisconsin, Illinois, California, Indiana and Minnesota, primarily among adolescents and young adults. Additional states have alerted federal CDC to possible (not confirmed) cases and investigations into these cases are ongoing. There is no conclusive evidence that an infectious disease is causing the illnesses. While some cases in each of the states are similar and appear to be linked to e-cigarette product use, more information is needed to determine the etiology. Clinicians should consider vaping-associated pulmonary illness in the evaluation of patients with significant respiratory illness and a history of vaping. Patients presenting with significant respiratory illness of unclear etiology should be asked about their use of vaping products. For patients who have used vaping products, clinicians should ask about the extent of use, the type of instrument used, the type of vaping liquid used, and the place of purchase. It is not yet known if similar cases are occurring in Maine. | | ||August 3, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1409664&an=1) |Maine CDC is aware of cases of varicella (chickenpox) in individuals who are staying at the Portland Expo Center. Varicella is a contagious viral disease that can spread easily to individuals who have not had varicella and have not gotten the varicella vaccine. There are several diseases that can cause a febrile rash in children, so Maine CDC encourages laboratory testing when assessing patients when possible. If diagnosed with varicella, patients may return to their congregate living setting if clinically stable and indicated by a provider. Individuals staying at the Portland Expo are already considered exposed. Providers should encourage patients to practice good hand and respiratory hygiene and stay away from non-immune individuals as much as possible.| | ||July 24, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1382010&an=1) |The purpose of this health advisory is to alert clinicians to the potential for human Powassan encephalitis disease activity in Maine and to consider testing for Powassan in patients presenting with unexplained encephalitis, meningitis or high fever (100.4F or 38C) during the summer and early fall. Maine CDC was notified of a human case of Powassan encephalitis (POW) in a Maine resident who resides in southern Maine. The individual was symptomatic in late June and hospitalized. CDC Fort Collins confirmed the Powassan result in this individual. Powassan virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Signs and symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurologic problems may occur. Symptoms can begin anytime from one week to one month after the tick bite. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe Powassan virus illness often need to be hospitalized. | | ||July 12, 2019 || |[Advisory (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1365401&an=1) |In the greater Bangor area, Penobscot County, Maine, physicians have reported 6 confirmed cases of legionellosis from November 2018 to the present. This is an increase from the 5-year median of 3.2 cases for Penobscot County. Cases range in age from over 50 to under 85 years old. Maine CDC is actively investigating the cases and has not identified a common exposure among cases. Health care providers should be aware of this increase in legionellosis cases and consider legionellosis in the differential diagnosis of any pneumonia case. Although urinary antigen assay is an adequate diagnostic test for Legionella, given the recent increase in number of cases, Maine CDC recommends respiratory specimen culture, particularly for patients who live in the greater Bangor area. Culture specimens can detect all species and serogroups of Legionella and may aide in exposure identification. Maine CDC requests Legionella isolates grown from respiratory specimens be sent to the Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL) for further analysis.| | ||July 3, 2019 || | |Maine CDC continues to support the City of Portland in connection with asylum seekers residing at The Expo.

Arboviral diseases, including Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and West Nile virus (WNV), are serious infections that are transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Maine reported a fatal case of JCV infection, a relatively rare arboviral disease carried by mosquitoes, in a resident in 2018. Additionally, Powassan virus is an arboviral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Maine identified zero cases of Powassan virus disease in residents during 2018. Although rare, these diseases have potentially severe and even fatal consequences for those who contract them.| | ||June 28, 2019 || |[Update (Doc)](https://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/attach.php?id=1338017&an=1) |Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) is providing this update on hepatitis A cases in the state in 2019.
