This week, Texas DSHS expects to receive 620,400 doses of vaccin e distributed to more than 1,100 providers across the State of Texas.

Each provider will likely have their own sign -up system, though they have all been trained on providing the vacci ne and the allocation order by Texas DSHS . Safety & Precaution s Even with limited vaccines available in our community, people need to continue to take additional COVID -19 prevention measures including: wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, cleaning frequently touched surf aces, and staying home if you're sic k. It is not yet clear from the vaccine trials whether individuals who receive the vaccine can still transmit COVID -19 to others. It is therefore very important that even those vaccinated take the same precautions as bef ore to ensure that they do not inadvertently spread the virus as a carrier .

While the COVID -19 vaccine may cause side effects such as fatigue, headache, fever, chills, nausea, muscle pain, and joint pai n, these side effects show that the vaccine is working . The FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will continue to monitor the safety of COVID -19 vaccines to make sure even very rare side effects are identified.
