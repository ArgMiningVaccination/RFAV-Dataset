It resulted in the Wilk vs. AMA trial and judge Susan Getzendanner ruling against the AMA and its \"long history of illegal behavior.\" But, roughly 35 years later, the attacks from medical doctors continue. Fighting misinformation The not-for-profit Foundation for Chiropractic Progress (F4CP) educates the public about and promotes chiropractic while also defending the profession against unwarranted attacks. These have included media responses over the past years against misleading medically-led articles in Forbes, the Washington Post, on CNN, and from the Dr. Oz Show, to name only a few. The latest misinformation piece was somehow greenlighted by editors at Psychology Today from author Gary Wenk, PhD. The innocuous title, \"When Should You Consider Chiropractic Care?\" turns into an all-out hit piece, noting chiropractic schools' high acceptance rate and concluding, \"Thus, it seems that almost anyone has the opportunity to become a chiropractor,\" ignoring that student DCs are required to complete more classroom hours than medical students. The article progresses to out-and-out falsities such as pregnant women and children should avoid chiropractic, and that \"any relief from pain...is likely due to the placebo effect.\" These articles and disparaging television spots continue, which leads one to ask (\"conspiracy theory\"?) whether concerted efforts by the medical community continue today. Perhaps the threat lies in chiropractic's all-time-high popularity among patients, the U.S. government and the U.S. military. Chiropractic for the masses Chiropractic franchises have cemented agreements over the last two years to bring chiropractic care to military bases, continuing the expanse of care for active and former military. The 125th anniversary of chiropractic two years ago was muted by the COVID outbreak, but that year also saw chiropractic deemed an \"essential service\" by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during the pandemic. Perhaps part of the vitriol from the MD community is from seeing chiropractic's mandate from the U.S. government to help clean up the prescription opioid mess the medical community created by working hand-in-hand with opioid makers. As documented, when Purdue pharmaceuticals released OxyContin in 1996, the drug was directly marketed to doctors whose prescription patterns showed them to be \"over-prescribers\" (Zee, 2009). Cleaning up a medical mess \"Unfortunately, the opioid epidemic in the U.S. is getting worse, not better,\" wrote Ray Foxworth, DC, FICC, MCS-P, for Chiropractic Economics last year. \"With MD doctors and opioids, studies show that 99% of medical doctors have prescribed highly addictive opioids, many for longer than the three days recommended by the CDC.\" It wouldn't be hard for DCs to write hit pieces on MD opioid overprescribing, or pill mills, or rushing patients toward surgery (where the money is) rather than non-invasive approaches to healing. But best to focus on the job at hand. We're in the midst of a health care crisis, and it's time to work together. The future lies in an integrated health care approach that puts the patient first.

Phthalates are chemical additives used to enhance the durability or consistency of plastics and a range of products. Humans are routinely exposed to these compounds when they leach out of the products and into the environment. They are also used as inactive ingredients in some medications, especially those that require extended or delayed release to work properly; for example, some anti- inflammatories and antibiotics. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggests that exposure to medication-associated phthalates may contribute to the development of some childhood cancers, and that minimizing exposure to phthalates may help prevent them. The study measured the association between gestational and childhood phthalate exposures and cancer incidence. Lead investigator Thomas Ahern, PhD, MPH, associate professor at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine, teamed with colleagues at Aarhus University and Odense University Hospital in Denmark. Using data from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the Danish Medicines Agency and the Danish Cancer Registry, they studied all live births between 1997-2017, totaling nearly 1.3 million children and 2,027 cases of childhood cancer. Childhood, but not gestational (in utero) phthalate exposure was associated with a 20% higher rate of childhood cancer overall. \"These results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that these ubiquitous chemicals have a negative impact on human health,\" said Ahern.

Investing in integrated research, education and Extension programs that seek to improve diet and nutrition, while working to prevent chronic disease, is a critical component of NIFA's work. Outcomes of these projects will have long-lasting impacts on health and wellness of Americans nationwide.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites chronic disease as the leading cause of death in the United States and also as a leading driver of annual health care costs.

Now, chiropractors from Chiropractic Doctors Association of Hong Kong (CDAHK) and Open University teamed up to explore spinal alignments and neurological pathology with the hopes of improving treatment. The team published a new paper in Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care outlining their findings. Many clinical studies have shown degeneration causes pain in the neck, headache, dizziness, numbness and stomach problems. All spinal surgeries changing motion across a joint can add additional stress on the adjacent vertebrae. These conditions can easily compress nerves, causing pain. \"The patient with neck pain can be caused by a spinal surgery performed 30 years earlier. The chronic conditions are often hard to manage,\" said Eric Chun-Pu Chu, investigator at New York Medical Group (NYMG) and chairman of CDAHK. Bone spurs, scoliosis, disc degeneration, spinal stenosis and spinal instability are only a few of the radiographic abnormalities seen in the neighboring segments. The goal was to find the biomechanical balance that can relieve discomfort and avoid unneeded surgery.Chiropractic adjustment was used to release restriction, and soft-tissue mobilization was applied to alleviate stiffness. The AI Robotic Rehabilitation (MID\u00ae) was administered to decompress the spine. The patient reported diminished symptoms and restored strength. Patients with neck pain by spinal fusion who are gradually developing neurological impairments are candidates for minimally invasive surgery. The current study aimed to bridge the gap between primary and tertiary care in the treatment of degeneration. Elderly patients with degenerative pain are demanding better health care. Before considering surgery, patients should always consider conservative therapy as an option.

SILVERMAN, DC, DACBN, 10-12 MIN. THE ROLE OF NUTRITIONAL TESTING IN DIAGNOSING AND TREATING MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS isn't an intuitive one. After all, we usually think of nutritional testing in terms of managing digestive issues, food sensitivities and leaky gut syndrome, not as a cause of lower back pain or aching knees. Based on the latest research into increased intestinal permeability and the role of the gut microbiome, however, it's time to expand our thinking and understand the significant value nutritional testing provides for our patients with musculoskeletal issues. MUSCULOSKELETAL IMPACTS OF NUTRITIONAL TESTING - PART I CHIROECO.COM MAY 1, 2022 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 17The gut's role in inflammation Muscle aches and painful joints can often be traced back to systemic inflammation that originates in the gut. Let's start with the fact that today about 75% of all Americans are overweight or obese, conditions that cause systemic inflammation from the overproduction of inflammatory mediators that include IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. The metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are so prevalent that only a small minority (about 12%) of adult Americans are metabolically healthy. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is the root cause of the massive overweight and obesity numbers. The SAD is a major contributor to why 72% of all Americans report they have experienced GI symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, gas, bloating or diarrhea a few times a month or more. But the SAD does far more damage than just occasional heartburn. It damages the lining of the gut, notably the lining of the small intestine, which leads to increased intestinal permeability. The longest part of your digestive system, your small intestine, is on average about 22 feet long, only an inch in diameter, and has a lining with the thickness of a wet paper towel. The small intestine is tightly wrinkled into many circular mucosal folds to increase the absorptive area. Each fold has thousands of tiny, fingerlike projections called villi; one square inch of the small intestine contains around 20,000 villi. Each villus has thousands of even more microscopic projections called microvilli. The folds, villi and microvilli all increase the surface area of the small intestine \u2014 when spread out, your small intestine has the surface area of a tennis court up to a basketball court. The villi and microvilli are made of a thin, flat layer of epithelial cells held together very tightly at the junctions where they meet \u2014 they resemble subway tiles on a wall. Properly functioning tight junctions open up just enough to let molecules of digested nutrients through them. This \"intestinal permeability\" is regulated by zonulin, a protein synthesized in intestinal and liver cells. Zonulin was discovered in 2000 by Alessio Fasano and his team at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Leaky gut syndrome When the small intestine is stressed or damaged, the tight junctions may open too widely, allowing larger molecules of undigested food, bacteria and toxins to enter the bloodstream inappropriately. This faulty functioning of the junctions causes gut hyperpermeability or increased intestinal permeability, better known as leaky gut syndrome. Think of the tight junc - tions as a screen door that should only let air through. When the screen openings are too large, or the screen has holes, flies and mosquitoes can get through. The leaky gut syndrome has many causes; some of the most common culprits are: Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity A wide range of food sensitivities Antibiotics Acid-blocking drugs NSAIDs Heavy metal exposure Food allergies Environmental toxins Concussion Yeast/bacteria overgrowthFEATURE STORY ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF ADULT AMERICANS ARE METABOLICALLY HEALTHYThe crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the joints, for example, can be an underlying cause of osteoarthritis. 18 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMClinics Average Over $20,000 During Our On-site Launch Event NON-MEDICAL WEIGHT LOSS SYSTEM FDA | IRB | CLINICALLY PROVEN 470.826.4533 invisa RED.com SCAN QR CODE FOR INFOSEE OTHER SIDE Marketing Templates Email, SMS, Social Mediainvisa-RED Weight Loss Device Patient Nutrition & Lifestyle GuideTurn Key Business System Digital Clinician Training Portal 24/7 Marketing System For Initial LaunchOngoing Clinical & Business System Training On-site Training, Installation & Sales For Demo Day Unlimited Marketing Support Ad Work, Content & Design 1yr Subscription to ChiroTv Customized in-house Education & Advertising Platform for All Clinic Services Paid Marketing Avg of 25-30 Consults Per Mo.

By increasing intestinal permeability when pathogenic bacteria are present, zonulin may help flush them from the system. However, the damage this does to the intestinal barrier may lead to leaky gut syndrome and may be an underlying cause of allergies, inflammation and autoimmune disease.1 People with celiac disease have been shown to have elevated zonulin levels. Because modern wheat has been bred to contain high levels of gliadin, one of the proteins in gluten, today many people are sensitive to gluten when in earlier times they would have had no problem. By some estimates, between 30-50% of the population is affected by non-celiac gluten sensitivity.2 Zonulin is also elevated in individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Elevated zonulin is also found in several autoimmune diseases and is a contributing cause of type 1 diabetes.3 Other food sensitivities can damage the intestinal barrier and cause leaky gut syndrome. Conversely, leaky gut syndrome can lead to multiple gut issues, especially food sensitivities. Damage to the gut epithelial barrier from the SAD and exposure to the many environmental toxins and chemicals in use today may be the primary reason for the sharp increase in allergies, autoimmunity and other chronic conditions over the past few decades.4 When undigested food particles, bacteria, toxins and other substances escape the small intestine, they encounter the immune system in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) that surrounds the gut. Some bacteria and other substances routinely escape the small intestine, and the GALT efficiently neutralizes them. When the tight junctions are compromised, they may allow large amounts of these substances to enter into the circulation, activating the rest of the immune system. The result is localized and systemic inflammation. In addition to a systemic inflammatory response, food sensitivities can cause or exacerbate musculoskeletal conditions, including joint pain, low-back pain, muscle pain and tightness. Gastrointestinal symptoms include gas, abdominal cramps, bloating and constipation. Rashes, fatigue and brain fog are other common symptoms. The gut microbiome and inflammation The hundred trillion or so of bacteria and other microor - ganisms typically found in the gut are collectively known as the gut microbiome. The bacteria in the gut are essential for breaking down fiber and undigested food particles when they arrive in the colon. Gut bacteria's metabolic byproducts (metabolites) include short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate. In addition to fueling the epithelial cells that line the colon, SCFAs play an essential role in modulating systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. The low-fiber Standard American Diet, antibiotic use, illness, alcohol use and several other factors can lead to dysbiosis FEATURE STORY 22 FEET THE SMALL INTESTINE IS ON AVERAGE ABOUT 22 FEET LONG, ONLY AN INCH IN DIAMETER, AND HAS A LINING WITH THE THICKNESS OF A WET PAPER TOWELA growing body of research links increased gut permeability and dysbiosis to degenerative processes in the spine, such as those that cause low-back pain.

In addition to the digestive problems dysbiosis can cause, an unbalanced microbiome means bacterial metabolites include more inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6. These enter the circulation and contribute to systemic inflammation. In addition, leaky gut syndrome and/or gut dysbiosis leads to the overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of enzymes that degrade most extracellular matrix proteins during normal tissue turnover. When MMPs' production is upregulated, it damages the collagen and causes tissue remodeling associated with cartilage degradation, arthritis and intervertebral disc degeneration. The gut-bone axis The role of leaky gut and dysbiosis in musculoskeletal prob - lems is being increasingly recognized. The crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the joints, for example, can be an underlying cause of osteoarthritis. In people inflamed for other reasons, including obesity, age and poor diet, inflammation from dysbiosis may be the final factor that causes joint inflam - mation. Dietary changes to improve dysbiosis and resolve leaky gut are often helpful for reducing joint inflammation.5 Another excellent example of the gut-bone axis is the role of the gut in intervertebral disc degeneration and low-back pain. A growing body of research links increased gut permeability and dysbiosis to degenerative processes in the spine, such as those that cause low-back pain. For example, in the case of intervertebral disc disease, one potential mechanism is the translocation of bacteria across the gut epithelial barrier and into the intervertebral disc, where they cause inflammation and degenerative damage. Another possible mechanism is systemic inflammation from increased gut permeability and dysbiosis added to existing inflammation from older age, obesity and poor diet. Yet another potential mechanism is diffusion of inflammatory gut metabolites into the intervertebral disc.6 As a final example, about half of all people with spondylarthritis, a group of related disorders that includes ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, have gut inflammation. Chronic gut inflammation predicts a higher risk of worsening disease among these patients. Reducing their gut inflammation leads to remission of joint disease \u2014 and vice versa. Therapies that simultaneously target inflammation in the gut and the joints are often beneficial.7 Part II of this article will appear in issue #8. ROBERT G.

Fleet is considered by many to have achieved the greatest healing results in the history of the profession. Starting in the 1930s, the police in San Antonio had to reroute traffic patterns to accommodate the patients coming to his office when he was open for adjusting hours. He had to move his office three times to conform with fire codes as there were too many people in his office at one time. Patients came to Fleet from all over the nation to heal from ailments that other chiropractors and medical doctors didn't know where to start with. A large percentage of these patients were coming to Fleet with seemingly very severe non-musculoskeletal conditions that stumped the medical community. The six zones Fleet's Zone Therapy analyzed the body's six main systems: glan - dular, eliminative, nerve, digestive, muscular and circulatory. He found that the brain had six main centers that controlled these six systems. He said that any disease was the physical result of one or more of these six systems requiring healing.A TIMELESS HEALING ART, UPDATED The origins of the Zone Technique and spinal cord stimulation to heal the brain BY NATHAN BROWNE, DC TIME TO READ: 7-9 MIN.PRACTICE CENTRAL 24 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMUltimate CBD Purity, Consistency and Predictability Third-Party lab test to ensure 100% purity THC Free & Non-habit forming or mind altering Simple and reliable dosing Available in both WARM and COOL Therapy CBD Isolate avoids entourage side effects Available in 500 and 1000 mg Proudly made in the USA Sombra\u00ae PLUS CBD Pain Relief are exactly as they read; everything you love about our original formulas PLUS something more - CBD !

He taught that on a physical level, a brain center that needed healing could be addressed by the stimulation of four points in the spinal cord. Each brain center (positive pole) had four corresponding levels of the cord (negative pole) that correlated to it. He determined which brain center needed attention by palpating occipital fibers on the superior nuchal line. On a side note, this has nothing to do with sacro-occipital technique (SOT) fiber palpation for a few reasons: SOT has 21 points, whereas zones have six; and the Zone Technique points indicate vastly different things than do the SOT points, which makes sense once you start learning the technique. The zones have a physical aspect (summarized above) and a metaphysical aspect. Understanding the metaphysical aspect of healing played a significant role in Fleet's amazing results. Bringing together both aspects of healing paved the way for Fleet's 40+ year journey teaching DCs all over the country how to efficiently help people who were essentially deemed helpless. Zone Therapy to the Zone Technique Peter Goldman, DC, was first exposed to Fleet's work at a very young age as his family chiropractor in Brooklyn was a respected student of Fleet. Fast forward to the early 1990s when Goldman started chiropractic school at Life College; he sought out four of Fleet's direct disciples and they started teaching him while he was in school. He spent over 100 hours one-on-one with each of them, learning and studying the technique. After graduation, Goldman combined what he learned from his four main mentors of the Fleet lineage and started practice. Goldman had patients who flew in from over 30 cities and countries around the world to see him, reminiscent of the Fleet days in San Antonio. Approximately five years ago, Goldman decided he wanted to share his knowledge with the profession, because if he did, suffering individuals wouldn't have to fly across the world to see him in order to get help. This is when the Zone Technique was created. It differed from Fleet's Zone Therapy as it combined many years of Goldman's study and experience with different healing influences such as metaphysics and world- class martial arts training. In addition to Fleet, some of Goldman's main influences include Nisargadatta, Koichi Tohei, Soshu Vivekananda, Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and Musashi. Spinal cord stimulation for healing Goldman's Zone Technique is spinal cord stimulation to heal the brain, not an intersegmental bone-moving technique. In chiropractic, the \"safety pin cycle\" theory assumes the brain is sending out proper signals which can be potentially blocked by vertebral misalignments or subluxations causing dis-ease. The chiropractor is to then locate and relieve these subluxations by aligning the spine in an effort to unblock these brain signals so they can freely travel to the cells in the body. While this theory makes sense, what if the brain isn't balanced and is sending out faulty signals in the first place? Then all you have done is opened up the pathway for a potentially flawed brain signal to travel through the body. For this reason (and others), many people who get adjusted regularly are still not healthy. Zone Technique efficiently determines which brain centers are not functioning properly and balances them with gentle spinal cord stimulation.PRACTICE CENTRAL The police in San Antonio had to reroute traffic patterns to accommodate the patients coming to his office when he was open for adjusting hours. 1931 YEAR THE ZONE TECHNIQUE WAS FOUNDED 26 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COM Red Light Therapy stand-alone unit Perfect for small professional spaces Reduces Pain & Inflammation Reverses the Signs of Aging Non-Invasive No Downtime Get 15% OFF + Free Shipping3- Y ear WarrantyMarketing T oolkit*30-day Client Acquisition package included*Financing available *Available IdealLightPRO Pad System BodyBalanceSystem.com 1-877-296-2228 OvationBOOTH Furthermore, a very important component of healing is understanding that the body is a reflection of the concepts in the subconscious mind. Knowing how to access the subconscious mind and how to create a proper healing concept is crucial in healing at the highest level. This is all clearly taught with the Zone Technique. Helping individuals who cannot find relief The proper application of Zone Technique, coupled with the high-level knowledge of the principles of healing taught in the Zone School of Healing, lead to unparalleled results. The Zone Technique has gained immense popularity worldwide over the last few years as it's fun to learn and easy to integrate into practice. An average patient visit is five minutes or less, making it very efficient without having to change the way you physically adjust. This has been a game changer for the more than 1,000 members of the Zone School of Healing. Nothing should make you more fulfilled than helping a suffering individual who has gone to several chiropractors, MDs, acupuncturists, homeopaths, etc., without the results they were hoping for, but found relief in your office.

THE TAKEAWAY Studies support that inflammation causes depression, a golden opportunity for chiropractors, while the pharmaceutical industry is manipulating data to inflate antidepressant medication results as it did with opioids. MANY CHIROPRACTORS UNDERSTAND just how flawed the medical system is; understanding just how poorly it addresses chronically ill patients should spur us to become proficient at supplying \"non-chiropractic\" solutions to \"medical\" problems. The opioid epidemic gave us an up-close look at just how flawed, unscientific and perhaps corrupt (thanks to the pharmaceutical industry) traditional medicine can be. The pharmaceutical industry, opioids and antidepressants The estimated economic costs of the U.S. opioid epidemic topped $1 trillion in 2017, according to a pair of CDC analyses. Nearly 500,000 people have died from opioid overdoses during the past 20 years. This crisis is largely due to the pharmaceu - tical industry's propensity to \"fudge\" the results of studies. We may be experiencing a similar manipulation of data when it comes to antidepressants. There are lots of studies concerning the effectiveness of antidepressants, nearly 80% of which are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. According to the British Medical Journal,1 only about 40-60 out of 100 people who took an antidepressant noticed an improvement in their symptoms within 6-8 weeks. A report published in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics states, \"Meta-analyses of FDA trials suggest that 30 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMantidepressants are only marginally efficacious compared to placebos and document profound publication bias that inflates their apparent efficacy. These meta-analyses also document a second form of bias in which researchers fail to report the negative results for the pre-specified primary outcome measure submitted to the FDA, while highlighting in published studies positive results from a secondary or even a new measure as though it was their primary measure of interest. The STAR*D analysis found that the effectiveness of antidepressant therapies was probably even lower than the modest one reported by the study authors with an apparent progressively increasing dropout rate across each study phase. Conclusions: The reviewed findings argue for a reappraisal of the current recommended standard of care of depression.\" Magazine ad revenue vs. study results Richard Smith, former editor of the BMJ, publicly criticized his former publication, saying that they were too dependent on advertising revenue to be considered impartial. One-third of the studies published in the BMJ are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Smith estimates that between two-thirds to three-quarters of the trials published in major journals \u2014 Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine \u2014 are also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Trials are so valuable to drug companies that they will often spend upwards of $1 million in reprint costs (which are additional sources of major revenues for medical journals). Consumers trust medical journals to be the impartial and \"true\" source of information, but money from big pharma influences both drug trials and medical journals. Medical science is to science what cherry Kool-Aid is to cherries. There is a vague scientific \"flavor,\" but it isn't the same as real science. The medical approach to depression The medical approach to depression is based on the idea that it is caused by a lack of neurotransmitter, either norepi - nephrine or serotonin (GABA, if you are talking about sleep disturbance or anxiety). Really? This has not been proven. Results have been fudged, with a tendency to publish only favorable results. The medical approach to depression (and just about every other health problem) is built around getting a patent \u2014 not getting the patients better. According to a report released by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the rate of antidepressant use in this country among teens and adults (people ages 12 and older) increased by almost 400% between 1988-94 and 2005-08. In 2008, 11% of the population took them. In 2017 it was 17% of the population. Treating depression as if it has a singular cause is great if you want a patent, but not so great if you want results. Maybe it is better to treat the patient who has depression rather than treating the depression. Treating the patient, not the depression Depression is a symptom, not its own disease. If you go through the literature, you will find it linked to problems with the thyroid, vitamin deficiency, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ad - renal axis,2 inflammation and even bowel ecology.3,4,5,6,7 The problem with looking at these issues is that it is impossible to find a single, patentable treatment \u2014 so they are largely ignored. The link between depression and inflammation is an interesting one. One study looked at CRP levels in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).8 Researchers found that high CRP levels made patients less responsive to treatment. High levels were also associated with cognitive impairment (which CLINICAL CONCERNS Treating depression as if it has a singular cause is great if you want a patent, but not so great if you want results. $1 MILLION TRIALS ARE SO VALUABLE TO DRUG COMPANIES THAT THEY WILL OFTEN SPEND UPWARDS OF $1 MILLION IN REPRINT COSTS FOR POSITIVE PUBLISHED STUDIES 32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMthe antidepressant treatment did not affect). Another study9 found a strong correlation between high IL-6 and CRP levels with depression. Patients with depression had higher levels of these inflammatory markers than did healthy controls. Inflammation and depression Inflammation causes depression. This tells us that diet matters, and studies support that.10,11,12 This is something that should be addressed in chiropractic offices because you can reduce inflammation with basic dietary advice. Chiropractors can be the answer to our nation's runaway medical costs (18% of the GDP and rising). If we look at depression as a symptom with many possible causes, we can come up with strategies to help these patients. Vitamin B intake can improve depression.13 Low levels of vitamin D are linked to depression.14 Low levels of DHA in the frontal lobe are linked to depression.15 Exercise outperforms drug therapy.16 You get the idea; depression does not have a single cause. Fixing the body's infrastructure can work better than aggressively manipulating the body's biochemistry with a drug. There are many more references than are listed here. Also, other nutrients are useful. Low-dose lithium and magnesium come to mind. We are the profession that treats the patient and not the disease; we need to expand our focus. A holistic approach from inflammation specialists Going beyond manipulation and adding basic nutritional therapy can increase the number of patients we can effec - tively treat. Furthermore, we can be the answer to runaway medical costs ($3 billion per year and rising). Inflammation is an issue that should be addressed in patients with depression. It is also a component in just about every disease. Inflammation can be effectively addressed with diet. Even if you are just treating kinks and strains, addressing inflammation with dietary advice will improve your results.

Our sun radiates all these same electromagnetic wavelengths, and more unseen, to provide the energy that sustains all life here on Earth. Red light comprises roughly 20-25% of the sun's visible radiation, so therefore we are exposed to the properties of a broad spectrum of red light daily. The sun, however, also radiates electromagnetic energy that we cannot see, some in the ultraviolet spectrum that we now know can be harmful to our health. Therapeutic red light Red light truly is not such a harmful spectrum of the sun's radiation, and it is sound to assume light-emitting devices that employ broad spectrum red light are not harmful to anyone at the energy levels they normally operate. Therapeutic red light is healthy in many ways, but it is very limited in its role in aesthetics due to its ability to affect only the outer most layers of a patient's dermis. This limitation is due to the high coefficient absorption of red light by the chromophores in the cells of our dermis that create an impenetrable barrier to the light after only a few millimeters of penetration.WHAT'S BEHIND INVISA -RED'S PHOTOBIOSTIMULATION SCIENCE Beyond red light and destructive tissue therapy into the quantum realm of unleashing natural biological processesChiropractic Economics Brandview | invisa-RED Technology The Only Non-invasive Laser FDA Approved, IRB & Clinically Proven for Fat Reduction, Weight Reduction, and Inch Loss.

The unique science of invisa-RED As we previously discussed, basic red light is rapidly absorbed and scattered in the outer dermis of a patient. In order to create a natural sculpting response from the body, all the dermal layers and the underlying adipose tissue would require an elevated level of sub-atomic energy, or quantum state, be imparted to the inter-cellular mechanisms, specifically the cellular \"power plants\" or mitochondria that create cellular respiration for all activity in the body. By stimulating the adipose's mitochondria, a patient would release the stored fats from the adipose layers under the skin, simular to strenuous exercise. This is where invisa-RED's proprietary delivery method of photobleaching with coherent infrared and red laser frequencies excels. The 680 nm of red laser is absorbed by the dermis, allowing the infrared at 980 nm to bypass the dermal tissue and absorb into the adipocyte cells. Without using infrared, it is not possible for any spectrum of light energy or laser to absorb into the adipose tissue, as infrared's 980nm has the highest coefficient energy absorption into adipose tissue. The pulsed infrared delivers the maximum level of energy density to stimulate cellular respiration, increase cytochrome c oxidase production, and ATP synthesis within the adipocyte cells.3 invisa-RED Clinicals v. Lipo-Laser Claims invisa-RED's unique scientific and evidence-based advantage over non-invasive red light/laser-based devices is apparent when we compare the clinical trials of the devices. The red-light-only devices are only able to achieve circumferential differences (inch loss) as seen in the following clinical trials: NCT02167867 and NCT02867150. Both of the mentioned red laser studies were only able to achieve 3.724 and 3.51 of inches lost during their respective studies, however neither study attempted to prove fat reduction or weight reduction because it is known that red light alone is not able to absorb into the adipose tissue and stimulate fat loss. What makes invisa-RED's clinical trial (NCT03811093) different is that by using both infrared and red lasers, invisa-RED was able to not only help participants lose an average of 10.16 inches, but also 4.53 pounds of body fat, resulting in a 1.75% reduction in body fat over the course of only nine treatments without the assistance of diet or exercise.2 Red-light-only devices have no clinical evidence to support their claims of fat reduction, making red-light-only lasers bad for business, your reputation and your patients. This is what makes invisa-RED the only option for a non-invasive fat reduction.

THE TAKEAWAY The obesity pandemic is hidden among us, causing a multitude of health issues and stressing the health care system. Chiropractors need to answer the call to improve local community health. FOOD IS MEDICINE, AND WEIGHT LOSS IS HEALTH CARE. If you believe that food really is \"medicine,\" then you'd have to agree that weight loss could be considered health care. Today there is a plethora of information and reproduceable research written in peer-reviewed journals regarding \"unhealthy weight\" that is costing us and killing us. And yet 70% of Americans are overweight or obese, and the numbers are growing. It's speculated that by 2030, if trends continue, one in two adults will be obese. With the COVID-19 pandemic shining an even greater light on this \"hidden pandemic,\" obesity's role can no longer be ignored for its impact on overall health. The systemic effect of obesity puts patients with COVID-19 at an even greater risk for compromised lung function, inflammation and other comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney disease. What we're seeing is that obesity is the foundation for most all other diseases and puts us in harm's way for the next coronavirus.Obesity is the 'dis-ease' The issue is that the disease of obesity, with its ICD-10 code, is often overlooked as a disease \u2014 yet its \"side effects,\" or comorbidities, are what are being addressed in allopathic health care. As is often the case, modern medicine tends to chase the symptom and not address the cause. Diabetes, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are symptoms that all have their foundation in obesity. A solution, based on chiropractic philosophy, is to address the cause of this unhealthy weight. If we address the cause and can prevent or ameliorate the symptoms of that \"dis-ease\" we have helped our patients immensely. Who better than the champion of getting to the cause, the chiropractor, to help their metabolically unhealthy patients? The National Institutes of Health recently stated that only 12.2% of the U.S. population has optimal metabolism, meaning almost 88% of our patients need an intervention. That is an overwhelming majority of chiropractic patients. 38 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMCONNECTIONS: REDEFINED UNITED IN THE BELIEF THAT CHIROPRACTIC IS ON THE RISE, TO HELP FACILITATE THE HEALTH OF MILLIONS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME.

A substantial proportion of individuals who are overweight or obese do not self-identify as overweight, and many parents of children who are overweight or obese likewise fail to identify their children as such. Couple this with the fact that most physicians still have a difficult time discussing weight with their patients and it indeed becomes an issue, as a patient undiagnosed with obesity is a ticking time bomb \u2014 one that we, as chiropractors, must address.The chiropractor, diet and insulin resistance Chiropractic education has a greater concentration on nutrition than medicine, so who better to treat unhealthy-weight patients than the chiropractor? Advising patients on their diet is a great primary intervention to prevent future disease. But what if that patient is already in trouble? What if your patient suffers from comorbidities of obesity? That same diet could be an effective secondary intervention to remediate those symptoms.

Besides adjusting your patient, advising on nutrition, exercise and positive mental health, utilizing an evidence- based, chiropractor-supervised dietary intervention is exactly what your patients need. The chiropractor can now, in collaboration with the patient's prescribing physician, be paramount in helping patients reduce or remove their side-effect-producing medications they are taking for those comorbidities associated with unhealthy weight. Insulin resistance, as Mark Hyman, founder and medical director of The UltraWellness Center, says, is perhaps the single most harmful hormonal disturbance in the body. Gerald Reaven, MD, professor emeritus at Stanford University, said that insulin resistance coupled with hyperinsulinemia was the cornerstone of metabolic syndrome and that the dead-on bull's-eye for insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is the overabundant carbohydrate. In our hyper-palatable, overprocessed food environment, simple and many times liquid carbohydrates are all too accessible for adults and kids. Many of those foods are easily recognizable, but there are other foods labeled as healthy such as granola, orange juice, veggie chips and some yogurts that contain high amounts of carbohydrates. Even condiments contain sugar and high-fructose corn syrup so that by the end of the day the amount of \"sugar\" we've eaten creates a hormonal tsunami starting with this macronutrient's effect on insulin. This hormonal storm sends us down the road to metabolic syndrome. Remember that our bodies, for millions of years, were designed to gain weight as an innate mechanism for survival. However, today, our physiology remains the same, yet our physiology and environment are not in sync. This high intake of sugar creates insulin resistance, weight gain and eventual ill health. Why an evidence-based protocol? What's the best diet? The one that works best for the patient. But, I believe it should be one overseen by a health care provider, coached by a chiropractic assistant in the chiropractic office and backed by science. It needs to be easy and convenient, and it needs to taste good if a partial meal replacement is one aspect of the diet. It must also be successful for the patient. It should yield robust weight loss in a repeatable, measurable and predictable way while being safe and effective: Safe in that, even in the weight- loss phase, all the recommended daily allowances for the macro and micronutrients in this diet are met. Effective , where on average men lose 3.5 lbs. per week and women 2.5 lbs. Its predictability strength relies on scientific methodology. A good diet should have a weight-loss phase, but also a stabilizing and maintenance phase so that the health benefits of a 10% weight loss last long-term. Lastly, any significant diet utilized in a health care provider's practice should have some hard evidence behind its efficacy.12.2% PERCENTAGE OF THE U.S. POPULATION WITH OPTIMUM METABOLISM, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHWe have an obligation, a calling, to help humanity. Chiropractors have always answered that calling. As is often the case, modern medicine tends to chase the symptom and not address the cause. 42 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMWELLNESS APPROACH Answering the call during the obesity pandemic We have an obligation, a calling, to help humanity. Chiropractors have always answered that calling. Today obesity is the pandemic that is hidden amongst us, causing havoc with our health, our pocketbooks, our health care system, and most importantly, our kids. Chiropractors must be frontline in stemming this rising tide. We can help our patients and their families by offering a structured, easy-to-do, scientific protocol that works every time \u2014 just like gravity. Why? Because it's our physiology that dictates whether we gain weight or keep it off. It's not our patients' fault. It is not about eating too much and working out less. There is hope. We indeed can use food as medicine, and weight loss as health care to improve community health. DENNIS BARLEY, DC, CCSP, a 1985 Life University alum, has been in chiropractic practice for 37 years and an Ideal Protein provider for the past 13 years. He is currently the vice president of health care strategy at Ideal Protein, where he helps providers implement the protocol within their practices. The Ideal Protein Protocol weight management system targets the root cause of weight gain through a low-carb, healthy- fat, adequate protein diet. Thousands of chiropractors across North America have added ancillary revenue to their practice by offering Ideal Protein, a safe and effective solution, to their patients who struggle with weight-related comorbidities.

It is the ultimate opportunity to create a relatable experience for potential patients. Patient stories are sometimes also called case studies or success stories; however, do not confuse them with testimonials. Testimonials are quotes consisting of a few sentences by consumers about a product or service. Patient stories are much deeper. It's more about their journey. They provide background information about the patient's problem and the solutions that helped them overcome their challenges. Start with consent To get started with running a successful patient stories program, you must have a participant consent and release form (or some type of similar waiver) signed by the patient. I would recommend contacting your attorney to obtain one. It's literally a simple, one-page (sometimes even one-paragraph) document giving you permission to share their story, pictures, etc.THE POWER OF PATIENT STORIES How to create, publish, share and grow your patient base BY JAY RESIO TIME TO READ: 7-9 MIN. 44 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMINTRODUCING ...

You will want to keep it short and simple. Here is a sample template to help inspire your own: Share Your Story to Help Others Thank you for your willingness to share your story about your wellness journey. Please fill out the following form. The more details the better. Our team will review the information and create a draft patient story. We will share with you for final approval before we share online. \u0084First Name (Please provide full name for internal use. For external use, only your first name and last initial will be shared. Example: Jay R.) \u0084Email (for internal use, will not be shared) \u0084Phone (for internal use, will not be shared) \u0084Short Bio Example: Father of four, husband, business owner. Love the outdoors, hiking and camping. \u0084Brief Description of Problem Before Treatment Example: I strained my back picking up a couch. My lower back was extremely tight and painful. Could barely get out of bed each morning. \u0084Images Headshot of patient or picture of them doing their favorite activities. \u0084Quote This could be a quote about the doctor or practice. Or it could be something inspirational. Example: \"Dr B. was attentive and caring. I felt like he treated me like family. I am grateful to get back my quality of life after dealing with my issues for so long.\" \u0084Comments (provide any other comments or thoughts that might be useful to the story) Alternatively, you could create a series of questions that are more conversational and schedule a call with the patient. Whatever works best for you and your practice. Write the story Take the information provided by the patient and combine it with knowledge about the patient's treatment to draft an initial patient story. You can execute this step in a couple of ways depending on your staff. If you have a member of your team who is capable of writing, let them handle the entire process, allocating a dedicated four hours a week (or whatever is needed). If no one can write, hire a freelance writer (find on Upwork.com or Scripted.com) and have a staff member manage the process. Make sure to include additional information not provided by the patient that would be useful to the story. Either way, it will pay dividends in the end. Some details to consider: Share specific or specialized treatments that were used . This is an opportunity to showcase expertise and innovative technologies. If you explain these in more detail on your site, you can link back to those pages from the patient story. The length and frequency of treatment . Example: Jane had two one-hour sessions per week over the course of eight weeks. She also performed exercises on her own at home. Outcomes and results . Did their pain decrease? Are they back to normal activities? Are they doing things they could not do previously?MARKETING MATTERS 2-4 AIM FOR 2-4 PATIENT STORIES PER MONTHPatient stories are sometimes also called case studies or success stories; however, do not confuse them with testimonials. 46 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMGet patients who stay and refer!

(877) 343-8950 Ext. 101The #1 Platform for Increasing Patient Loyalty I would suggest making the \"tone\" of the patient story more personal/human feeling and less robotic/academic. The writer should also draft posts for social media. Make sure to customize accordingly based upon the text requirements and limitations for each platform. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram will be your top options. Review and edit Share the draft patient story with the patient to make sure there are not any misrepresentations. It is also a good idea for multiple people on the staff to read it as well. All feedback is welcomed and insightful. Edit and tweak accordingly. Graphic assets You will want to create template graphics that can be customized for each patient story. For instance, if your patient story page is going to have a header graphic with a picture of the patient that includes their first name and last initial. You also could include their issue (Example: Jay R. \u2014 sciatica). The same would apply to graphics to be used for social media posts. Create templates that fit the size requirements of each platform. Make sure to include your practice logo for branding in case the graphic is shared outside of your social media profile. One of the social media graphics could make use of the patient's quote as well. Get creative and have fun with it. Publish and share Post the patient story on your practice website or blog. I would also recommend adding a patient story block to your home page, maybe showing the most recent one or two. As you continue to add, it will frequently update the home page and send signals to the search engines that you are keeping your content fresh, which helps to increase page rank. Share the patient story link and related content (text and graphics) on all your social media. Email the story link to your patient so they can share it with their friends and family. Create relatable stories At the end of the day, you want whoever reads the patient's story to be able to relate to the journey and challenges faced. You want them to imagine them - selves in that patient's shoes. And most importantly, you want them to feel like you are the right health care partner to help them too. I would aim to create and post 2-4 patient stories per month. Content is king. The more you share, the more opportunities to connect with potential new patients. Give the process some time as well. Don't just do a couple of patient stories and give up. It will be worth it and provide ongoing value to your practice. And lastly, remember to always be respectful of the patient and never share any personally identifiable information.

THE TAKEAWAY Are you working within your specialty(s) or do you have \"Shiny Object Syndrome\"? Examine these five cash levers for a chiropractic business to push back against the current economic instability. INFLATION CUTS INTO YOUR EMPLOYEES' POCKETBOOKS, which means they need more money to maintain their quality of life. Inflation cuts into your patients' pocketbooks, leaving them less money to pay for your services. Why must you hedge for rising wages in the future? 1. Fewer people are looking to work 2. Inflation is getting worse With fewer people in the labor force, other businesses pay more to retain good people. Many larger corporations can offer benefits that smaller companies cannot afford. Continue tightening up your business and focus on boosting your profitability and streamlining your processes.Shiny Object Syndrome Years ago, a business mentor diagnosed me with \"Shiny Object Syndrome\" because we had so many services that weren't complimentary, and I found that 80% of my problems came from 20% of our revenue. For example, we dabbled in aesthetic procedures, clinical trials, and other unrelated items to our pain-relief services. But, since we didn't do them regularly, it was cumbersome to deliver those services, and it took our focus off our leading service, which was pain relief or wellness visits. After a couple of tough conversations with my spouse, we decided to start trimming services, and we noticed our profits increased. Our team was also happier because they shined when working on our core services. 50 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMEndorsement Our services are endorsed by consultants and management groups who previously did not believe in billing services.

What would you do if you only got paid on an outcome? What do you love to do, and are there enough of those types of patients in your area? Once you figure out what your core service is and what you stand for, it's easy to make business decisions based on that. Then I look at the different cash levers in my business. What are the cash levers in your business? 1. Increase your dollar-per-visit average \u2014 what can you raise your prices on? What is a congruent upsell in your business? Weight loss is congruent for musculoskeletal patients because fat creates inflammation and increases joint pain. Look at your existing patients and collect more per visit; can you find more patients like this? 2. Increase your volume \u2014 if you deliver more services per day, you'll generate more revenue. If you block schedule your patients after they start a treatment plan, it fills your schedule. If you schedule every patient for their next visit when they arrive, it prevents them from leaving the office without a future visit. You'll get more volume if you convert more new patients into treatment plans. You'll have more volume if you convert more active care patients into wellness care. If you think you're at capacity, maybe you're not because streamlining your initial visit, examinations, treatment times usually can be simplified in most offices. 3. Reduce your accounts receivable \u2014 we always priced our services for the next day to ensure that we collected from every patient before receiving the service. Have regular meetings with your insurance department and personal injury team to ensure you collect the services you are delivering. 4. Reduce your operating costs \u2014 labor is one of the bigger expenses for most offices; your team should focus on their most productive tasks. Too often there is no directive from the leadership team on the most important tasks; each team member should know what they were hired to accomplish and how success is measured. When I was in practice, each team member knew their job and what statistics they were measured on. They had various reports they ran and multiple spreadsheets they used to manage patients. As we grew, I saw the need to automate this and developed a software that took data from our EHR/EMR to automate specific tasks and showed them which patients they should follow up with that day. This allowed them to be productive in between patients. 5. Reduce your inventory and unfinished projects \u2014 Inventory on the shelf is an expense; try to keep this at a minimum. Unfinished projects are also expensive; this is why you should only focus on a few projects at a time because until your project is complete, your business will not reap the rewards of your work. Free up your front desk I also found that the front desk spent too much time answering the phone, which seems counterintuitive. We added online scheduling for new and existing patients, which helped reduce many calls. At the end of our voice mail, we also had a message that said, \"For a quicker response, please text.\" Before changing the voicemail to this, we would have patients calling back rather than leaving a voicemail. Many of the calls were about moving an appointment or informing our office the patient was running behind.

If your front desk spends less time answering the phone, they can spend more time with patients in your office or reaching out to patients who haven't been in for a while.

Just because you have staff to get work done doesn't mean that it is a good use of their time. This is why it's essential to know your core services and each person's role in your business. Don't confuse activity with accomplishment, and you should know what your people are working on.

It seems there's a website or app built to deliver on our every whim, eliminating the need to run out to our local corner store or pharmacy. Everything is virtually at our fingertips. From UberEats' General Tso's Chicken to mail-order Covid-19 tests, just Google it (Bing it, Yahoo it or Reddit it...) and watch it magically appear at your doorstep. But you have to find it, and for it to be found, your content needs search engine optimization (SEO). Every health care practice can benefit from SEO When it comes to health care, we find doctors, services and health care practices this same way. We search online, read community comments, check Yelp reviews and browse directories. This is why running a medical practice requires an online presence and marketing efforts to connect with potential new patients. After all, the best health care provider in the world isn't helpful if no one knows where to find them. Word of mouth about your business practice has moved from the company water cooler to searchable online community groups, chat rooms and online directories complete with hashtags, links, opt-ins and landing pages.

When someone searches for a chiropractor, ultimately you want your chiropractor business to appear as one of the top 4 results. This way, your practice, rather than someone else's, is more likely to get a phone call or a click to your website for more information. While this sounds simple, remember your business is competing for placement with millions of other companies and chiropractors much like yours. So how does Google decide which businesses will show up at the top? Paid versus organic search There are two ways Google's search engine ranks businesses for search result queries: paid search and organic search, the difference being somewhat obvious. Paid search results are those listings requiring a fee for the search engine to list their link for a particular keyword. A widely used form of paid listing is pay per click (PPC) where you pay each time someone clicks on the link of your ad. The price increases in accordance with the competitiveness of the keyword. Organic search results are pulled by the search engines' web crawlers that rank your website for relevance. This is calculated based on keyword match in your website pages and the number of links to your website from outside sources. Ranking at the top of search organically is most optimal, because not only is it free, but people are more likely to click on organic search results than those results appearing as paid search. Start small No company is too large or too small to benefit from an SEO strategy. However, the more important question is, \"Where do you want to take your business?\" as that will determine your SEO goals. If the idea is to expand the number of patients and increase revenue, then a top search result on Google is crucial. If your practice relies solely on referrals and the current revenue stream is keeping up with your expectations, then a more complex SEO strategy may not be necessary for you. SEO strategies range in size from simple blogging and keywords to hiring an outside marketing company or SEO expert to provide an arsenal of data-driven marketing tactics. Regardless of size, every health care practice should incorporate the following organic SEO practices to optimize search ranking: Get Google reviews from happy customers . The first thing potential patients do to learn about your business is to review sites. Learn where your patients are searching to find you, and make sure your business appears there. Add fresh content to your blog . Google reads new blog post pages as an update to your website, giving your site preference in search. Adding links in your blog posts to other pages and blog posts on your website also improves your website's search ranking. Write about services your practice offers on your blog . Use actual language in your blog posts that is likely to be input into a Google search browser to find information. This helps pull up your blog post as a result to a search match query leading directly to your website. Post new images on \"Google my Business.\" Keep directories up to date with properly titled images and relevant information, including hours and location. List all services, products and offerings. Stay relevant in your community . The world has never been more connected than it is now via the internet. Everything you do in the real world, from volunteering to supporting schools, to sponsoring local events, gets shared online and drives back to your business. Seek outside links from your community to your website.TECH TALK TOP 4 WHEN SOMEONE SEARCHES FOR A CHIROPRACTOR, ULTIMATELY YOU WANT YOUR BUSINESS TO APPEAR AS ONE OF THE TOP 4 RESULTSIt's not about the size of your practice or whether your business can support the effort, it's about the business goals of your company. 58 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMTECH TALK Write articles in local newspapers and magazines . Stay out front and center by offering your wisdom as an industry expert. Not only does it keep your name and business practice top of mind, it provides a digital linking opportunity from media outlets to your website, which improves your website's search ranking. Grow your practice through advanced SEO strategies Your SEO budget will be determined by the loftiness of your business objectives. You can start small by buying Google Ads and setting aside a monthly budget, or go big by hiring a marketing firm or SEO partner. \u0084Buy relevant keywords with Google Ads . Head over to Google's keyword planner to discover which keywords are best for your practice. Just drop in names of services or products related to your business. The results will give you a long list of keywords, how frequently they are searched, along with pricing and competition level for the keyword. Look for words or phrases that you can ultimately own that aren't highly competitive or break the bank. Find the balance of relevant words with low competition. You can refine your keyword search on the right to help you narrow down your results. Once you narrow your search, test them out with a Google Ads plan designed to drive traffic to your website. You can also use those keywords throughout your website to help the website get found in search. \u0084Conduct an SEO website audit . Hire an SEO expert to go through your company's website and optimize it for search engines. Expect your website content to be optimized with proper title tags, meta descriptions, keywords, links, backlinks, load speed and image titles. Once optimized, your website will run quickly and efficiently, ready to appear in search. \u0084Hire an SEO firm for a more complex, ongoing SEO effort . If you're looking to grow your revenue, you'll need to expand your reach to drive more business to your practice. This requires a more advanced SEO strategy that is implemented for you, constantly adjusted and refined for optimal results. It's not about the size of your practice or whether your business can support the effort, it's about the business goals of your company. This is particularly helpful for multi- location practices delivering a high return on investment. Start building your website search ranking now Establishing your online credibility is the digital equivalent of building your real-life professional reputation. It's important to embrace technology as part of your business growth model, as old school, traditional methods of getting business leads have gone by the wayside. Today, patients gain trust in service providers who have online visibility, reputable reviews, and easy-to-access information they need. Once you get your website optimized and start pointing traffic directly to relevant content on your site, you'll be amazed by the number of views and leads coming to your website, and in turn, through your front office door.

WONG, DC TIME TO READ: 10-12 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY Chiropractors can provide crucial foot-care guidance and information that the patient will not get elsewhere, becoming the voice for foot stabilization in communities. EACH NEW PATIENT WHO WALKS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR of your chiropractic clinic presents an opportunity for you to make a huge impression on their lives. Many of these individuals have already been bounced around to multiple health care practitioners for their ailment(s) with varying degrees of success. It is typical for new patients to exhibit disappointment, confusion and irritation with the type(s) of care they have had thus far. The patient may have received a diagnosis and treatment from a previous health care practitioner, but they are still in pain and are looking to you for different answers.Treatment protocols and foot function We have been taught since chiropractic college that during a first patient encounter, there are specific steps to take. We must successfully interact with the patient, gather pertinent facts, and then arrive at our specific diagnosis and treatment plan. Observation, history-taking, physical/orthopedic and chiropractic examinations are just some of these important areas to cover. Assessing the patient's foot function should also be part of the initial visit. Not only do these steps provide critical information to help fact-find, but they also convey to the patient that you are very skilled and thorough at your job. The patients may have seen specialists (podiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, etc.) who treat pain with medication, 60 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMinjections or surgery and tend to focus on symptoms of an issue rather than addressing the root cause, which is often dysfunctional feet. When allopathic medicine focuses on pain points, many acute and chronic conditions are simply prolonged, causing additional stress to other areas of the body. Ultimately, this creates additional frustration and cost for the patient while increasing the risk for surgical complications and/ or opioid abuse. The feet as the body's foundation One the most important areas of the body to evaluate on every new patient is ironically glossed over regularly by health prac - titioners in general. The two feet are the body's foundation, and they offer powerful information toward understanding the stability and biomechanical state of the patient's whole body. Most patients do not realize that there are three arches rather than just one on the inside of the foot. Introducing the concept of how the feet affect the rest of the body on the initial visit sets the framework for future care. This \"foot-spine connection\" is a powerful tool in helping a patient understand stresses that affect the body from the feet all the way up to the head and jaw. As chiropractors, we are trained to evaluate the spine and extremities of the body, and we employ these skills depending on the patient's presenting complaints. When the feet are out of alignment, the entire body is affected and becomes unbalanced. Assessing and correcting foot function should be an integral part of chiropractic treatment and can help doctors achieve better care outcomes. Examining the feet With the patient barefoot and standing in front of you in an anatomical position, look at their feet and observe what state the three arches are in. I have observed that 99% of patients coming to our clinics exhibit excessive foot pronation that is either mild, moderate or severe. It has been established that overpronation of the feet puts stress and strain on the ankles, knees, hips, pelvis, axial spine, shoulders and jaw. The remaining 1% of the population are excessive supinators or have healthy weight bearing. You will see far more overpronators than oversupinators. Here is a menu of options on how to identify excessive foot pronation quickly and easily:Visual changes of the feet: Have the patient stand in front of you and take a look: Bunions on Metatarsals (MT) 1 and 5 \u2014 due to the flattened MT arch, the MTs rub against the edges of the shoes and calcium deposits in response to the stress. Hallux valgus of the big toe \u2014 collapse of the MT/medial arches makes the big toe move laterally. Hammer toes \u2014 collapse of the medial/lateral longitudinal arches makes the foot grow longer, pushing the toes into the edges of the patient's shoes. This combined with the flattening of the MT arch can lead to hammer toes. Calluses \u2014 ones located on the tops of the toes and on the balls of the feet are due to collapse of the MT arch. The tops of the toes hit the roof of the shoe while the MT heads rub on the sole of the shoe or the ground. The 5 Red Flags of Overpronation: External foot flare Internal knee rotation Medially bowing Achilles tendons Flat medial arches Uneven lateral heel wear The digital foot scanner A weight-bearing, 3-D, laser digital foot scanner offers accurate assessments of the state of the arches underneath the feet. The scan indicates the severity of the arch collapse.

Recall that the gait cycle has two phases: the Swing Phase (40%) and the Stance Phase (60%). Focusing on the more clinically relevant information, let's talk about the stance phase where the foot is in contact with the ground. There are three parts of the Stance Phase: 1. Heel Strike \u2014 the calcaneus hits the ground and supinates while a force of 5 Gs goes from the heel into the ankle. That same force begins moving up the axial kinetic chain until it becomes .5Gs at the jaw after 10 milliseconds. 2. Foot Flat \u2014 the foot pronates at the subtalar joint and the tibia and femur bones internally rotate so the foot can grip the ground and make solid contact. 3. Toe Off \u2014 the MTP joints flex, the plantar fascia tightens, and the foot supinates as it gets ready to swing forward for the next step. The key takeaway for the Stance Phase is realizing that during the foot flat portion, the tibia and femur bones are internally rotating under normal pronation circumstances. For people who are overpronating, their tibia and femur bones are excessively internally rotating with every step they take. This creates stress at the medial ankle, medial knee, hip, SI, lumbar spine and up the kinetic chain to the neck/head. Excessive pronators can wear down the cartilage and connective tissues in these joints, predisposing their bodies to arthritis, soft tissue injuries and pain. What the evaluation of the feet reveals is that the feet have a critical role to play in overall body stability and stress. If the arches are flat, the feet cannot absorb shock and distribute forces in a safe manner for the body. Compensation results and problems arise in many areas of the body. To that end, recommending the proper arch support for the feet becomes paramount. The digital scanner we discussed earlier or the traditional foam casting kits come into play. The scan or mold is analyzed by the lab correlating the patient's age, height, weight and gender. Sixteen different measurements are then used to create a custom molded, three-arch orthotic to be worn comfortably in the patient's shoes. So not only do these types of orthotics support the patient's feet, but they stabilize the whole body from the ground up. Of interesting note, a conclusive study, \"Shoe Orthotics for the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial,\" published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, shows that three-arch, flexible, custom orthotics, particularly in combination with chiropractic care, significantly reduces low-back pain and improves function.1 Patients do not often seek chiropractors out for foot- related issues because our current medical model would have them see a specialist instead. These doctors do not have the background and treatment methods that we do in regard to helping the entire body heal itself naturally. This is a point in the treatment path at which chiropractors can provide crucial guidance and information that the patient will not get elsewhere. Become the voice for foot stabilization Chiropractors can position themselves to really understand the feet and the biomechanics. We can and should be the voice for foot stabilization in our communities as there few ways patients are going to learn this information. Because of the nature of their care, chiropractors can evaluate and converse with patients regarding the feet, walking and foot stabilization, and impacting the kinetic chain. KEVIN M.

THE TAKEAWAY Many patients prefer to speak to chiropractors and other holistic-based practitioners about CBD versus their regular medical doctor, and by educating your patients on safe use, you can help establish your authority. NEARLY A THIRD OF ALL PEOPLE USE CBD PRODUCTS and tend to prefer non-traditional therapies that are becoming more mainstream such as chiropractic. As you see patients you have a great way to introduce them to CBD therapy and guide them to results that will reduce their pain and bring them back to health as soon as possible. CBD origins and why quality matters Cannabidiol is a single component of the cannabis plant widely known to have pain-relieving and other health bene - fits. It is one of over 80 cannabinoids that help reduce anxiety and inflammation. The chemicals within the cannabis plants, particularly CBD, stimulate the endocannabinoid system, endogenous lipid- based retrograde neurotransmitters binding to cannabinoid receptors, expressed throughout the central (CB1) and peripheral nervous system (CB2). CBD doesn't appear to bind to these receptors but seems to work by preventing the breakdown of the natural endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglyerol most famous cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Most cannabinoids do not produce as strong or effective an interaction with the endocannabinoid system as CBD, and CBD has no hallucinogenic effect. The other potent chemical within the cannabis plant is THC, which is the hallucinogenic component and still illegal. Fortunately, strains of the cannabis plant that are commercially and legally farmed for CBD contain low levels of to zero THC. CBD and contaminants That doesn't mean all CBD products are pure and free of contamination. Under selected studies, various CBD products were tested for the concentration of CBD and other cannabi - noids, including THC. Many products did not contain the CBD listed, with some barely containing 5% of the stated value. Additionally, to legally sell CBD products, the product must contain less than 0.3% THC. Over half contained levels of THC much higher than this, some going above 10%.

There could be dangerous drug interactions for many of your patients, as CBD and THC interact with medications for pain, cancer, arthritis, seizures and blood pressure. CBD is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically the CYP3A4 enzyme. Nearly 60% of clinically-prescribed drugs, including methotrexate, are metabolized by CYP3A4. Metabolism of the drugs could be slowed, possibly leading to a dangerous buildup, particularly in methotrexate used for cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure medications and blood thinners. Despite the potential side effects, many people turn to CBD to reduce the side effects and number of medications they take. Many people who use CBD find a significant reduction in the need for prescription medications for pain, anxiety and other health issues. You should be aware of the side effects of CBD. Although few and very mild, CBD can affect some people negatively. The most common side effect tends to be drowsiness or decreased alertness. CBD can change your patients' appetite, for better or worse. Others experience faster-than-normal digestion that can result in diarrhea. Finally, CBD can result in anxiety, mood swings and erratic behavior in some people. For any of these side effects, you should monitor your patients closely and document their feelings, digestion and any physical side effects to adjust the dosage or cease use altogether. Why patients want CBD Any number of reasons exist why people use CBD. The top reasons include: Pain Inflammation Relaxation Migraines Depression and anxiety Sleep problems Cancer treatment symptom relief Epilepsy Muscle spasms associated with MS, Parkinson's Seizures High blood pressure Substance abuse Of course, there are plenty of false claims out there, including curative solutions for: weight loss, arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, asthma and breathing disorders (smoking cannabis may help, but causes other health problems), and with autoimmune issues. But let's not forget potentially the biggest downside of CBD \u2014 it's a palliative therapy in most cases. It may not stop the problem from progressing; instead, it unfortunately may only mask the symptoms. Pain, arthritis, anxiety and other issues often have deeper, systemic origins that CBD does not treat. Still, given a choice between prescription medication or over-the-counter pain relievers and CBD, many choose CBD. Selling CBD in the practice An estimated 33% of the population already uses CBD, with that number expected to double over the next five years. Some research estimates over half of the population will be using CBD to help control health issues within the next 10 years. As chiropractors, many balance between what is considered allopathic medicine and that considered alternative medicine. Offering CBD can help increase your patients' trust and compliance, while helping to deliver increased results. Many patients prefer to speak to chiropractors and other more holistic-based practitioners about CBD versus their regular medical or traditional doctor, and many trust chiropractors will provide natural and safe solutions over prescription medications. Fortunately, that puts you in a situation of being seen as an authority and the products you offer and use as higher- quality and worth the price. By using CBD in your practice and educating your patients on safe use, you can help establish your authority and have a potential income stream.WELLNESS APPROACH 5-7 DAYS A PERSON WILL NORMALLY FEEL THE EFFECTS OF CBD WITHIN 5-7 DAYS OF TAKING THE DOSE, AS LONG AS DAILY CONSISTENCY IS MAINTAINEDNano-particulate-based oil preparations tend to have a high bioavailability. 68 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS MAY 1, 2022 CHIROECO.COMWELLNESS APPROACH However, you must be very careful so you're not perceived as prescribing CBD or recommending CBD over prescription medications. This is considered illegal in most areas and against most chiropractic association guidelines. Teaching patients how to use CBD Finding the proper CBD product with the easiest delivery and quality necessary to achieve results can be challenging. Poor- quality products may do nothing for your clients. Most well-established, reputable companies provide CBD oil as their primary delivery method. Most have documented bioavailability at 20-30% and should indicate that in their materials. Nano-particulate-based oil preparations tend to have a high bioavailability. Established professionals trust CBD oil over other methods and applications. Capsules and edibles have a wide bioavailability range, from 5-20%. And when it comes to edibles, the amount of CBD available can vary within the batch from 0-30%. Edibles include gummies, chewables, food-based snacks (brownies, cookies) and liquid drinks. Topical application for massage therapy and relaxation can be an integral part of your therapy for your patients. Most CBD topical applications have a 1% bioavailability because of poor transmission to the bloodstream. However, the skin and muscle concentration at the application site is much higher (>50%) and can provide tangible results. There are multiple other delivery forms, including vapes, sublinguals, injectables and patches. However, these are not recommended, as dosing can vary considerably. Manufacturers should label how much CBD is present within a product. You should work with your patients to understand a proper dose. A common unit of measurement is a 10-milliliter bottle of oil containing 1,000 mg of CBD. At the recommended starting dosage of 5 mg, you would have 200 doses within the bottle. At 0.5 ml per dose, your client would take one drop to achieve proper dosing (one drop = 0.5 ml). Properly labeled and tested CBD products will contain the correct amount of CBD and often include cheat sheets for how much to use. Most medical documentation shows most people tolerate 20 to 1,500 mg of CBD per day well. However, this depends on a person's body weight, illness or condition, individual body chemistry and previous use. Currently, there is no recommended amount of CBD set for health conditions. The exception is the prescription Epidiolex, used for two specific types of seizures. However, there are some common suggestions found in literature:Anxiety \u2014 300-600 mg/day Central neuropathic and cancer-related pain \u2014 A maximum of 30 mg/day Arthritis and pain \u2014 A maximum of 30 mg/day or 250 mg applied topically IBS and gut inflammation \u2014 5 mg twice daily The most important thing about CBD dosing is that it follows the biphasic effect. A certain optimal dosing will react well within the body. If the dosage is too low, the results will not be felt. However, if the dose is too high, the CBD interferes with itself and reduces the effectiveness and relief a person feels. A person will normally feel the effects of CBD within 5-7 days of taking the dose, as long as daily consistency is maintained. Incorporating CBD into your practice effectively Providing CBD products for sale within your practice can offer you additional revenue and authority. Choosing the better- grade and higher-quality CBD products positions you as someone people can trust. Fortunately, many quality CBD companies offer training and provide services to help set up a practice, providing educational and marketing materials to sell the product. Additionally, you can start using CBD within your practice through massage therapy to relax muscles. The proper application of massage therapy combined with CBD can help loosen muscles and tendons before an adjustment and help increase the effectiveness and results your patients feel. The use of CBD within your practice takes a little bit of effort to get established but can provide additional revenue and health benefits to your patients. A quality company will help you set up and make sales. The pain relief your patients can get from CBD is worth the time and effort you put into it.

Your skills . Some courses may better complement your current skillsets than others, making them a more natural choice as they allow you to build on your skills and strengths even more. Your patients . Are there any differential diagnosis courses that may be better suited for your patient demographic? Availability .

Your patients count on you to help them through this difficult time, as do your family and friends. If you're a business owner your employees are counting on you also. In pre-pandemic times there was less to worry about and it was easier to find mental escapes and downtime. Now we're trying to create that new normal as a society, trying to make it look as close to the old normal we can, for both doctors of chiropractic and their patients. WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER Last year we told the story of the two young chiropractors who 30 years ago attained their DC degrees, both near the top of the same graduating class and full of enthusiasm to enter chiropractic care. When they returned for their 30-year reunion, both were married with family and had stayed in touch over the years. But while one worked in a multi-doctor practice, the other had founded his own multi-location practice and as CEO was contemplating an early retirement. THE DIFFERENCE? How and why did the two DC's paths diverge? Both sought success. Both were near the top of their class in school. Both entered the field with enthusiasm. The difference-maker was the business of chiropractic - learning the economics of the industry. The eventual CEO subscribed to Chiropractic Economics and gained the knowledge to take his practice to the next level. LET OUR KNOWLEDGE BE YOUR POWER Chiropractic Economics is the only BPA Audited publication requested by over 20,000 Doctors of Chiropractic.

It is made of a thin, lightweight, porous nylon fabric (stitched with Kevlar) so it doesn't stretch like an elastic back brace and is breathable. The material compound makes it extremely durable (it has a 5-year warranty), yet comfortable enough to wear all day, plus it doesn't hold heat, so you won't get hot and sweaty. The patented 5:1 compound pulley system enables the BaxMAX to get five times tighter than elastic braces, resulting in five times the support, and it can be loosened almost instantly. 888-422-9629 BaxMAX.net PATIENT EDUCATION 3D Consultation is cloud-based patient education software with high-quality 3D graphics doctors can use to quickly increase patient understanding and compliance.
