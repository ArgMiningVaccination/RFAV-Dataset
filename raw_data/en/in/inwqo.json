Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Fina ncial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Un ited States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenanc e of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statem ents that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the cons olidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United St ates. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The proced ures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial st atements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to New York University's preparation and fair presentation of t he consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of New York University's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accountin g policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 2 overall presentation of the consoli dated financial statem ents. We believe that the audit eviden ce we have obtained is s ufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statement s referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consoli dated financial position of New York University and its subsidiaries a s of August 31, 2020 and 2019, and the changes in their net assets and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordan ce with accounting principl es generall y accepted in the United States of America. Emphasis of Matter As discussed in Note 2 and 11 to the consolidated fi nancial statements, New York University change d the manner in which it accounts for leases and presen ts restri cted cash within the consolidated statement of cash flows in 2020. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Other Matters Other Matter Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The consolidating informatio n is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounti ng and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The consolidating informat ion has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial stat ements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconc iling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financi al statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves and other additional procedures, in accordance with auditing standards ge nerally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the consolidating info rmation is fairly stated, in all material res pects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements take n as a whole. The consolidating information is presented for purposes of additional analysis of t he consolidated financial st atements rather than to present the financial position, c hanges in net assets and cash flows of the individual companies and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements . Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the financial position, change s in net assets and cash flows of the individual companies. Other Information Our audit was c onducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financ ial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards for the y ear ended August 31, 2020 and sc hedule of financial res ponsibility data as of and for the year ended August 31, 2020 are presented for purposes of additional anal ysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal3 Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and the Department of Education, respectively, and are not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. The information is the responsibility of manage ment and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards and schedule of financial responsibility data are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 11, 2020, except for footnote 20 to the consolidated financial statements and with respect to the opinion on the schedule of financial responsibility data, as to which the date is June 24, 2021 on our consideration of New York University's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of their compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters for the year ended August 31, 2020. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.

Summary of Si gnificant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentat ion The consolidated financial statements of NYU have, in all material respects, been pr epared on an accrual basis in ac cordance with account ing principles generally accepted in the Uni ted States of America. The accom panying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NYU, as well as its separately incorporated affiliates . NYU and, generally, all of its affil iates are exempt from federal income taxes under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. NYU prepares its cons olidated financial statements in accordance w ith the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Acc ounting St andards Codifica tion (ASC) 958, Not for Profit Entities . This standard focuse s on the entity as a whole and requires classification of net assets as determined by the existence or absence of restrictions placed on the assets' uses by donors or by provision of law . A desc ription of the net asset classifications fol lows: Without D onor Restrictions: net assets of NYU that are used to carry out its missions of education, research and patient care which are not subject to do nor restrictions. With Donor Restrictions: Net assets subject to dono r-imposed restrictions that will be met eit her by the actions of NYU or the passage of time. Items that are included in donor r estric ted net asset s are gifts for which donor -imposed rest rictions have not been met i n the year of receipt; endowment s, annuit y, and life income gifts; pl edges; investme nt return on donor restricted endowment funds ; and endowments where the principal may be e xpended upon the passage of a stated period of time. Expirations of restr ictions on net assets with donor restrictions ar e reported as net assets rele ased from rest rictions. In addition, NYU has elected the simultaneous release option for contr ibutions that are also subject to pur pose restrictions. Activi ties Revenues and ex penses related to conducting programmatic activities and provision of s ervices by NYU are classified as operating in the consolidated statement s of activities . Invest ment r eturn relating to board -designated ed as well as pension a nd post retirement nonservice costs, changes in pens ion and postretirement obligations , net assets released from restriction for capital purposes, and other activity that is not part of N YU's core activities , are classified a s nonoperating in the consol idated stat ement s of activities. Tuition and Fees Tuition and fees are derived from degree programs as well as executive and cont inuing education programs. Tuition and fee revenue is reco gnize d within the fiscal year in which educational services are provi ded as the performance obligation is satisfied. Tuition and fee receipts received in advance of a semester are recorded as defe rred revenue. Financial aid, in the form of scholar ships a nd grants, including amounts funded by the endowment, research funds, and gifts reduces the published price of tuition for students receiving such aid. As such, financial aid is referred to as a t uition New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 9 discount and represents the difference betwee n the s tated charge for tuition and f ees and the amount that is billed to the student and/or third parties making payments on beha lf of the student. Tuition and fees are reported net of financial aid on the consolidated statement s of activities. Auxiliary Enterprises Auxiliar y enterpris es are self-suppo rting activities that furnis h goods or services to students, faculty, staff, or incidentally to the general public, and charge a fee directly related to, al though not necessarily equal to, the cost of the goo ds or s ervices . Auxiliary ente rprise s include student housing and dining, real estate rental income, and other similar activiti es. Student housing and dining services are delivered over the academic terms and r evenues are recognized ratably as the performance obligatio n is satisfie d. Student housing and din ing servi ces ar e presented net of financial aid on the consolidated statem ents of activities . Grants and Contracts NYU receives funding for sponsored program s from va rious government agencies, foundations, and corporat ions. The funding m ay represen t a re ciprocal tr ansaction in exchange for an equivalent benefit in return, or i t may be a nonreciprocal non-exchange transaction in which the funding provided is for the benefit of NYU , the funding organization's mission, or the public at large. Revenues from non-exchan ge transactions may be subje ct to condi tions, in the form of bot h a barrier to entitlement and a refund of amounts paid (or a release from obligation to mak e future payments) . NYU's grants and contracts are primari ly cond itiona l non-excha nge tr ansactions and revenues are recognized when expens es are incurred. Unspent conditional contributions from grants and contracts total $6 89,495 and $602, 753 at August 31, 2020 and 201 9, respectively . Revenues f rom unconditional non-exchange transact ions are recognized in the period aw arded. In 2020 and 2019, grants and contrac ts revenue recognized from U.S. governmental sources totaled $523,845 and $ 511,822 respectively . Such sponsored grants and contracts generally provide for th e recove ry of ind irect costs supporting these activities. Indirect costs, included in grant and c ontract revenues, are recovered at rates established in advance by NYU through negotiations with the U.S. federal government and other private sponsors and totaled $173,851 and $163, 778, respective ly. In 2014, NYU Langone Health w as awarded a $982,400 mul ti-year fixed capped public assistance grant from the Federal Emerge ncy Management Agency (FEMA) for both repair and replacement of damages and hazard mitigat ion projec ts as a result of Superstorm Sandy. The hazard mitigation project portion of t he awar d was recogni zed as a cont ribution with d onor restriction (Note 17 ), with a corresp onding FEMA receivable (Note 6). The net assets are released from restriction as the costs are incurred and totaled $12,179 and $43,683 for the year s end ed August 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectivel y. Cont ributions Contributions, including uncondit ional p romise s to give, are recognized as revenue in the period received at their fair value . Contributions receivable are reported at their discounted present value, using an estimated interest ra te for t he year in which the promise was received and cons idering marke t and credit risk as applicable ( 1.47% in 2020 and 2.25% in 2019) . Amortiza tion of the discount is recorded as additional contribution revenue. Allowanc es are recorded fo r estimated uncollec tible contributions based upon management's judgment and analys is of the creditworthiness of the donors, past collection experience and other relevant factors. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 10 Fair Value Measurements Authoritative guidance of f air val ue measurements, AS C 820, Fair V alue Measurements , establishes a hierarchy of valuation methodologies based on the extent to which as set valuations are observable in the marketpl ace. The following descr ibes t he hierarchy o f methodologies u sed to m easure fair value of invest ments: Fair value for Level 1 is bas ed on unadjusted quoted prices in actively traded markets that NYU has the abil ity to access for identical assets and liabil ities. Market price dat a is g enerally obtai ned from exchange or deal er markets. Fair value for Level 2 is based on quoted pri ces fo r instruments similar to those held by NYU in actively traded markets, quoted prices for identical instruments held by NYU i n markets that are not activel y traded and m odel-based valuat ion tech niques for which all signif icant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. Inputs are obtain ed from various sources including market part icipants, dealers and br okers. Fair value for Level 3 is based on val uation techniques used to as sess prices that are unobserv able as the assets trade infrequently or not at all. Investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per sha re as a practical expedi ent consist primaril y of NYU's owners hip in alt ernative investments (pri ncipally limited partnership i nteres ts in public equity, hedge funds, credit, real assets, private equity, real est ate, and other similar funds). The NAV of the securities held by lim ited partnerships that do not have readily determinable fair values are determined by the general part ner and are based on appraisals or other estimates that require varying degrees of judgment. If no public market exists for the i nvestment securities, th e fair value is determined by the gen eral par tner taking into considerat ion, among other things, the c ost of the securities, prices of recent significant placements of securities of the s ame issuer and subsequent developments concer ning the companies to which th e securities r elate. NYU has p erformed due diligence on these inv estments and belie ves the reported N AV as a practical expedient is an appropriate measure of fair value as of Augus t 31, 2020 and 2019. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation t hat may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of fut ure fair val ues. Furthermore, while NYU believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consi stent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions t o determine the f air valu e of certain financial inst ruments could result in a diff erent estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash an d cash equivalents include cash and all highl y-liquid debt instrument s with original matu rities of three m onths or less when purchased . This does not include pooled inves tments with less than three months to maturity held within the long- term investment p ortfolio . The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fa ir value due t o the short -term maturity of the instruments . NYU maintains its depos its with hig h credit quality financial institutions, with balances that exceed federal depository insurance limits . Management does not believe the credit risk relat ed to these deposits is significant. All shor t-term, highly liquid inv estments, which would otherwise qualify as cash equivalents that are included in NYU's investment pool within long- term investments , are treated as investments and are New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 11 therefore excluded f rom cash and cash equivalents in the consol idated statement s of cash flows. The f ollowing table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash e quivalents reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of cas h flows: 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents 3,220,829$ 1,953,180$ Cash in long-term investment pool (Note 5) 140,305 152,054 Cash in deposits with trustees (Note 9) 141,731 11,548 Cash in other long-term investments (Note 5) 3,443 405,293 Cash in assets held for professional liabilities (Note 13) 27,966 44,164 Cash in other assets (Note 8) 8,796 14,535 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,543,070$ 2,580,774$ Land, Bu ildings, and Equipment Land, buildin gs, and equipment are carried at their acquisition or construction c ost. If donated, these asse ts are recorded at t heir fair value on the date of the gift . Building s and equipment are depreciated over their est imated useful lives (buildings and building improvements 10- 60 years, equipment 3- 10 years) using the straight -line method. Repairs and maintenanc e expenditures are expense d when incurred. Collections The U niversity does not assign a value to collection items . Collection it ems are generally held f or educational purposes a nd ar e not disposed of for financial gain or otherwise encumbe red in any manne r. Deferred Revenue Deferred re venue consists of tuition and fees and student housing a nd dining fees recei ved in advance of the Fall sem ester as well as funding received for grants a nd contr acts in advance of incurring the qualifying expense s. Asset Retirement Obligation NYU recognizes asset r etirement obligations on future events, such as the abatement of asb estos and removal of lead- base d paint and petr oleum bulk storage tanks from building s. The fair value of the liability for a conditional ass et retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it occurred, provided that it can be reasonably estim ated. Corresponding asset ret irement costs (n et of accumulated depreci ation) h ave been included in land, buildings, and equipment. Funds Hel d for Others Funds held for others consist of NYU's federal grants refundabl e and deferred compensa tion plan liabilities (457(b) ). Corresponding assets are incl uded within accounts receivabl e (Note 6) and other assets (Note 8), respectively . Account ing Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requi res management t o make estimates and assu mptio ns that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabiliti es, th e disclosure of contingencies at the date of the New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 12 consolidated financial stat ements and the repo rted amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could di ffer from tho se estimates. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the 2019 conso lidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year 's presen tation. These reclassifications ha ve no impact on the net as sets or changes in net assets previously reported. Authoritative Pronouncements Adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standar ds update (ASU) 2014 -09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This standard implements a single framework for recogniti on of all revenue earned from custom ers. This framew ork e nsures that entities appropriately ref lect the consideration to w hich t hey e xpect to be entitled in exchange for goods and services by allocating the transaction price to identifie d performance obli gations and recog sat isfied . Qualitative and quant itative disclosures a re req uired to en able users of financial statements t o understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows ari sing from contrac ts with customers . NYU implement ed this standard using a full retrospec tive app roach in fiscal year 2019 and concluded there was no openi ng net asset impact. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2 016-14, Prese ntation of Financial Statement s for Not -for- Profit Entities . Under the new guidance, the existing three categories of net ass ets are replaced with a simplified mod el that combines temporarily restricted and permanently restricted net assets i nto a single category called \"net assets wi th donor restrictions\" and renames unrestric ted net assets as \"net assets without donor restrict ions.\" There are new reporting requir ements for expenses a nd additional disclosures to d escri be an organization' s liquidity . NYU implemented this standard usi ng a retrospective approach in fiscal yea r 2019. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 -08, Not-for-Profit Entities, Clarifying the Sc ope and the Accounting Guidan ce for Contributions Received and Contributions Made. This standard provides a framework for evaluatin g whether grants should be accounted for as exc hange transactions or as nonexchange tr ansactions. For none xchan ge tra nsacti ons, the new guidance clarifi es whether arrangements are conditional or unconditional. NYU implemented this standard usin g a modified prospective approach in fiscal yea r 2019 and concluded there was no openi ng net ass et impa ct. In Februar y 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016- 02, Leases . Under the new guidanc e, lessees are required to recognize the following for all leases with a term of twelve months or greater at the commencement date: (a) a lease liability, whi ch is a les see's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis ; and (b) a right -of-use (ROU) asset , representing the l essee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Leases are classifi ed as either op erating or finance leases ( formerly referred to as capital leases) . Recognit ion, measurement, and present ation of expenses and cash flows arising fr om a lease are determined by a lease's classification. NYU adopted the new standard on September 1, 2019 u sing the modified retrospec tive transition meth od that allows for application of the standard at the adoption date rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements. As permitted under the transi tion guidance, NYU elected a package of pr actical expedients which, among other provisions, al lowed NYU to carry forward historical lease class ifications. Upon adoption, NYU recog nized $2,718,449 of operating lease obligations in the consol idated balance sheet. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 13 In August 2016, the FAS B issued ASU 2016 -15, Classification of C ertain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 20 16-15 includes guid ance on eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practi ce with the presentat ion or classification of certain transactions within the statement s of cash f lows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. NYU adopted this standard in fiscal year 2020 using a retrospective appro ach. Adoption did not have an impact on the consolidated stateme nts of cash flows . In November 2016, the FA SB issued 2016- 18, Restricted Cash, which addresses the presentation, disclosure, and cash flow classification of restricted cash and requires that the statement s of ca sh flows explain t he change du ring the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equi valents. Entities are required to reconcile these amounts on the consolidated balance she ets to the consolidated statements of c ash flows a nd discl ose the nature of the restrictions. The standard is effective f or fiscal years beginning after Dec ember 15, 2018. NYU adopted this standard in fiscal year 2020 using a retrospective approach and included the require d reconciliation and dis closures in the C ash and Cash Equivalents sectio n of Note 2. New Authoritative Pronouncements not yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016- 13, Financial I nstruments -Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The previous stand ard dela ys the recognition of a credit loss on a financial asset until the loss is probabl e of occurring. The new s tandard rem oves the requirement that a credit loss be probable of occurring for it to be recogni zed, and require s entities to use historical experie nce, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecas ts to estimate their future ex pected credit l osses. The standard is required to be applied using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to net assets, if any, upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginnin g after December 15, 202 2. NYU is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements. Impact of C OVID-19 In January 2020, t he Worl d Health Or ganizati on declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) to be a pandemic. On March 7, 2020, the Governo r of New York declared a state of emergency, and the Mayor of New York City made a similar emerg ency declaration on Marc h 13, 2020. The pandemic i mpac ted NYU's activities with Executive Orders issued by the Gove rnor of New York State and related federal, s tate, and city law, regulations, and guidance resulting in the cancelation of elective procedure s at NYU Langone Health, the tr ansiti on to r emote learning and closur e of student residences at the campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, and the discontinuance of activities at each of the global academic centers. As of August 31, 2020, NYU Langon e Health has re -opened all ser vice lines an d pati ent service revenue has returned to near pre- COVID -19 levels. For Fall 2020, NYU 's New York campus offered courses using a hybrid model with sections conducted partly or fully in- person or remote. All of NYU's cours es, including those that are in-person, may be attended rem otely. Fall 2020 undergraduate enrollment increase d 2% from Fall 2019 and graduate and pr ofessional enrollment for Fall 2020 decreased 2 % from Fall 2019. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Econo mic Security Act On March 27, 2020, t he Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ( CAR ES Act ) was enacted. The CARES Act impacted NYU as follows for the y ear ended August 31, 2020: The Provider Relief Fund (PRF) appropriated $175 billion to rei mburse eligible healthcare providers f or expenses attributable to COVID -19 and lost reven ues. NYU Langone H ealth New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 14 received payments totaling $570,200 which w ere recognized in program fees and other revenues in the consolidated statement s of activities , bas ed on information contained in laws and re gulations, as well as interpretat ions issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS) gover ning the funding that was public ly availa ble as of August 31, 2020. NYU Langone Health received $432,800 in advanced payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ) which were reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2020. The Higher Education Em ergency Relief Fund ( HEERF ) approp the seco ndary Education. The U .S. Depar tment of Education ( DOE ) awarde d HEERF funds based on an institution of higher education's Pell Grant recipients and full -time enrollment. Bas ed on these criteria, DOE awarded $25 ,626 to NYU in May 2020. T he Univers ity recognized $6,158 in program fees and other revenues in the consol idated statement of activ ities and $9,734 in deferr ed revenue in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2020. Financial aid awar ds include $7,272 of COVID -related emergency grant s to students support ed by University funds, HEERF funds, and donation s for the year ended August 31, 2020. T he Univers ity disbursed the remaining HEERF funds during the F all 2020 semester. NYU deferred the deposi t and payment of $116,190 related to the employ er's share of Social Secur ity taxes which are reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2020. These deferred payments are due to be paid in two equal installments on December 31, 2021 and Decem ber 31, 2022.

Financial Asset s and Liquidity Resources As of August 31, 2020, and 2019, financial assets and liquidity resources a vailable within one year for general expenditure, such as operating expenses, sche duled princip al payments on debt, and capital costs not fi nanced with debt, were as follows: 2020 2019 Financial assets: Cash and short-term investments 3,223,281$ 1,957,483$ Investments available for general purposes 743,208 610,885 Accounts receivable, net 188,011 156,726 Grants and contracts receivable, net 115,562 112,721 Insurance premiums receivable 114,290 90,730 Patient accounts receivable, net 847,254 973,185 Non-endowment pledge payments due within one year 140,741 181,300 Other assets 19,746 44,745 Subsequent year endowment distribution 188,448 174,597 Total financial assets available within one year 5,580,541 4,302,372 Liquidity resources: Undrawn bank lines of credit 1,405,600 1,019,081 Funds functioning as endowment available for operations 1,593,729 1,442,772 Total liquidity resources 2,999,329 2,461,853 Total financial assets and liquidity resources available within one year 8,579,870$ 6,764,225$ The Unive rsity's cash flows have seas onal v ariations during the year att ributable to tuition billing cycles and, at times, a concentration of contributions received at calendar year end. The U niversity's Reserve and Liquidi ty Management Pol icy provides g uidelines for calculating and reporting the global cash posit ion on a dai ly basis as well as rigorous cash flow forecasting. This a pproach is adopted to maximize the portion of working capital funds that may remain invested . The Working Capital Fund Investment Pol icy (the Investment Policy ) has a primary objecti ve of aligni ng the maturity and liquidity profile of the working capita l portfolio with NYU's antici pated spending needs, while prese an d maximizing retu rn among a subset of app roved investment grade product s and providers. The Investment Policy establishes c oncentration limits for both inve stment s and banking institutions . Liquidity res ources are available with NYU board of trustees approval. As part of NYU Langone Health's liquidity ma nagem ent, financial as sets are struc tured to be available as its general expenditur es, liabilities and other obligat ions c ome due. In additi on, NYU Langone Health may invest cash in excess of daily requirements in short -term or liq uid in vestments. In Ap ril 2020, the Health System entered into three lines of credit, each totaling $100 million and each expiring in April 2021 (Note 1 2). As of August 31, 2020, the Health System has not drawn on these lines of credit and the total available amount of $300, 000 is included in the table abo ve within liquidity resources.

Patient Care Revenue and Receivables Patient care revenue for NYU, net of contra ctual a djustment s and implicit price conces sions for the years ended August 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows : 2020 2019 NYU Langone Health gross charges 36,148,464$ 36,139,995$ NYU Langone Health contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions (28,936,898) (28,440,683) University patient care 36,450 55,101 Total patient care revenue 7,248,016$ 7,754,413$ The University's Colle ge of Dentistry provides dental servic es to patients a s part of a student's training. Performance obl igations a re met and patient care revenue is recognized as services are performed. NYU Langone Health has agr eemen ts with third party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from its established rates (i.e. gross char ges). Payment arrangem ents include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges and per diem payment s. NYU Langone Health grants credit wit hout collateral to its patients, most of whom are local r esidents and are ins ured under third- party payor arrangements. NYU Langone Health bills patients and third- party payers several days after the services are pe rformed and/or the patient is discharged. Patient service reven ue is recogniz ed as performanc e obligations are satis fied over time based on actual charges incurred in relation to total expected charges. Generally, per formance obligations over time relate to patients receiving inpatient acute c are services or patient s receiving ser vices in NYU Langon e Health's outpatient and ambulatory care c enters. NYU Langone Health measures the performance obligation from admission into the hospital or the commenc ement of an outpatient or physician service t o the point when it is no longer requi red to provide s ervices to that patient , which is generally the time of di scha rge or the completion of the outpatient or physician visit. As substantially all of its perform ance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, NYU Lan gone Health has elected to apply the optional exemption provid ed in ASC 60 6-10-50- 14(a) Revenue from Contracts with Customers which removes the requirement to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allo cated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied at the end of the repor ting period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to above are primarily related to inpatient acute care services at t he end of the reporting period. The perf ormance oblig ations for these contracts are generally compl eted when the patients are discharged, which generally occurs within days or w eeks of the end of the reporting perio d. NYU Langone Health determines the tra nsaction price based on gross charges for services pro vided, reduced by adjus tments provided to thir d-party paye rs based on contractual agreements, discounts provided to uninsure d patients in accordance with NYU Lang one Health's policy, and implicit conces sions provided to unins ured patients. For the years ende d August 31, 2020, and 2019, NYU Langone Heal th recorde d $103,211 and $107,353, respectively, of implicit price concessio ns as a direct reduction to patient ca re revenue. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 17 NYU's patient accounts receivable, after contractu al adjustments and implicit pri ce concessions is $847,254 and $973,185 at Augus t 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. NYU Langone Health estimates its implici t price concessions using a quart erly standardized approach to review historic al collections based on major payor cl assification as a practical expedient t o account for patient c ontra cts as collective groups rather than individually. Based on historical c ollection trends, the financial statem ent effects of using this practical expedient are not materiall y different fro m an individual contract approach. In addition, NYU Langone H ealth assess es the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimburs ement issues and assess the impact, if any, on estimates. NYU Lango ne Health belie ves that the col lectability of its rece ivables is directly linked to the quali ty of its billing processes, most notably those related to obt aining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services i t provides. Subsequent changes to the estimate of tra nsaction price are reco rded as adjustments to net p atient care revenue in the period of the change. Certain patient care re venues received are subject to retroac tive adjustments under Retr oactive adjustme nts are accrued on an estimated basis in the p eriod the relate d services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. NYU Langone Health has established estimates, based on information pres ently available, o f amounts due to or from Medicare an d non- Medicare payors f or adjustmen ts to current and prior year payment rates, based on industry -wide and hospital -specific data. The amou nts due to third party payors included i n accounts payable and accrued expense s on the consoli dated balance sheets is $146,837 and $94,317 at August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, certain payors' paymen t rates for various years have b een appealed by NYU Langone Health. If the appeals are successful, additional inco me applicable to those years will be re alized. Laws and regulati ons govern ing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As a r esult , there is at least a reasonable possibi lity that recorded esti mates will chan ge by a material amount in the near ter m. NYU Langone Hospital s' Medicare cost reports have been audited by the Medicare fiscal intermediary through August 31, 2015; however, final s ettlements are pending for 2003 and 2004. Prior to their m erger into NYU Lang one Hospital s' Medicare cost report, NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn and NYU Langone Hospital -Long Island filed separate stand- alone Medicare cost reports through December 31, 2015 and July 31, 2019, respectively. NYU Langone Hospital -Brooklyn's Medica re cost reports have been audited by the Medicare fiscal inter mediary throu gh D ecember 31, 2015; however, final settlements are pending for the years 2008 to 2013. NYU Langone Hospital - Long Island's Medicare cost repor ts have been audited by the Medicare fiscal intermedia ry through August 31, 2017 and there are no f inal settleme nts pending. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 18 The mix of patient care revenue for the years ended August 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: Health System NYUGSoM Health System NYUGSoM Medicare 17% 17% 16% 18% Medicaid 2 1 2 1 Medicare and Medicaid managed care 18 14 17 15 Blue Cross 26 17 26 17 Managed care and other 37 51 39 49 100% 100% 100% 100% 2019 2020 The mix of patient accoun ts receivable, net from patients and third part y payors at August 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follow s: Health System NYUGSoM Health System NYUGSoM Medicare 10% 13% 9% 13% Medicaid 2 1 2 1 Medicare and Medicaid managed care 18 13 21 16 Blue Cross 27 18 21 15 Managed care and other 43 55 47 55 100% 100% 100% 100% 2020 2019 NYU Lango ne Health's charity care pol icy, in accordance with the New York State De partment of Health' s guidelines, ensures the provision of qualit y health care to the com munity serve d while carefully consi dering the ability of the patient to pay. The policy has sl iding fee schedules for inpat ient, ambulatory and emergenc y services provide d to the uni nsured and under -insured patients that qualify. Patients are eligible for the charit y care fee sch edule if they meet certain income tests. Since payment of the differ ence between NYU Langone H ealth's standard charges and t he charity care f ee schedules is not sought, these forgone charges for charity care are not reported as revenue. Total forgone charges fo r charity care totaled $102,569 and $102,918 for the years end ed August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This equated to an approximat e cost of $22,103 a nd $21,758 for the years ended August 31, 2 020 and 2019, respectively , which is based on a rati o of cost to charges. New York State regulations provide for the di stribution of funds from an ind igent care pool, which is intended to partially offset the cost of uncompensated care and service provided to uninsured. The funds are distribute d to NYU Lan gone Health based on an uninsured patient methodolog y. Subsidy payments recog nized as revenue am ounted to approximately $43, 554 and $60,944 f or the years ended August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are include d in patient care revenue in the consoli dated s tatement s of activities. NYU Langone Health paid $61,545 and $60,584 into the indigent care pool for the years end ed August 31, 2020 and 2019, respec tively.

The pension liability growth rate toget her wit h the obj ective to achieve and maintain a fully -funded level over a reasonable timeline implies a minimum absolute rate of return to be met through either: (1) annu al budgeted contr ibutions, (2) pens ion ass ets growth, (3) plan de- risking improv ements, or (4) a combination thereof. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 41 The strategy for achi eving and maintaining a fully funded pension liability may vary with the prevailing funded level and other parame ters related to the overall goal. The asset allocation process is designed to be dy namic a nd employ a liability -driven, glide path investment strategy, which reframes risk and performance relative to the pension liability. This approach is expected to enable pension assets t o more reliably tr ack the value of the pension liability, with less fu nded level volatility, than a static total -return in vestmen t. Broad t arget allocations at the current funded level are 55-75% return - seeki ng asset s, such as equity and real estate (REIT ) funds, and 25- 45% liability-hedging assets, such as f ixed income funds. The expected long -term rate of return assumptio n is de termined by adding expected inflation to expected l ong-term real returns of vari ous asse t classes, weighin g the asset class ret urns by the plans' invest ment in each class, and taking into ac count e xpected v olatility and correlation between the retur ns of various asset classes. Working with our actuary, NYU management believes 6.0% - 7.75% is a reasonable estimate of long- term rat es of return on pl an asse ts for 2020 and will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions and adjust them as necessary . The following table presents the fair value of the postr etirement benefit plan investm ents at August 31, 2020 and 2019 according to the asset categori es defin ed in N ote 5: Active Observable Unobservable Markets Inputs Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Public equity 114,703 $ - $ - $ 114,703 $ Fixed income 43,941 13,261 - 57,202 Cash and other 694 - - 694 Total 159,338 $ 13,261 $ - $ 172,599 $ Active Observable Unobservable Markets Inputs Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Public equity 96,956 $ - $ - $ 96,956 $ Fixed income 41,582 17,911 - 59,493 Cash and other 452 - - 452 Total 138,990 $ 17,911 $ - $ 156,901 $ 2020 2019 The plans' investm ent objectives seek a long- term total rate of return to meet NYU's current and future plan obligat ions. The post-retirement benefit plan target as set al location mix is 70% equity and 30% fixed income and cash, for which each asset class has a pe rmitted range of +/- 10%. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 42 The expected long- term rate of return assumption is determined by adding expected i nflation to expected long- term real ret urns of various asset classes, taking into account expected volat ility and correlation betwee n the returns o f various asset classes. NYU management believe s that 6 .0%-7.0% is a reasonable range of long -term rates of return on plan assets for 2020 and will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions and adjust them as necessary. Contributions Annual contributions to the plans are determi ned by NYU based upon calculations prepared by the plans' actuaries . Total exp ected contributions for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in f iscal year 2021 are $63,010 and $29,910, respective ly. Bene fit Payments The following benefit payments, which reflect expe cted future ser vice, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the following years: Defined Benefit Postretirement Year Ending August 31, Pension Plans Benefit Plans 2021 in multi -employer defined be nefit pension plans . NYU makes cash contribut ions to these plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that co ver its union employees based on a fixed rat e and hours worked per week by the covered employees . The risks of participating in these multi-employer p lans are different f rom ot her single -employer plans in the following aspe cts: (1) assets contribut ed to the multi -emplo yer plan by one employer may b e used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (2) if a part icipat ing employer s tops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligat ions of the plan may b e bor ne by the remaining partici pating employe rs; and (3) if NYU chooses to stop participating in some of its m ulti-employer plans, NYU may be required to pay thos e plan s an am ount ba sed on the underf unded sta tus of t he plan, referred to as a withdraw al liabil ity.

Pooled assets include both donor restricte d endowment fund s and funds desi gnated by the board to functi on as endowments. NYU cl assifies as n et as sets wi th donor restr ictions the historical value of donor -restricted endowment funds, whic h includes : (a) the ori ginal value of gi fts donate d to the per manent endowment , (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowmen t, and (c) accumu lations to the per manent endowment required by the applicable dono r gift instrument . Also included in net assets with donor restri ctions is accumulated unspent earning s on donor restricte d endow ment funds which ar e available for expendit ure in a manner co nsisten t with the standard of prudence described by the New Yor k Prudent Management of Inst itutional Funds Act (NYPMIF A), and deficiencies as sociated wit h funds where t he value of t he fund has fallen below the original value of the gift . The historical va lue of NYU's donor -restricted endowment funds to taled $2,284,97 3 and $2,183,087 at August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively . NYU defi nes the appropriation of endowment net assets for expen diture as the aut horization of its investm ent spendi ng rate as appro ved annually by the Board of Trustees (Note 5). Howev er, when donor s have expressly stip ulated the payout pe rcentage of earnings on endowments that differs from NYU po licies, the donors' intent prevails . In making a determinatio n to appr opriate or accumulate, NYU adheres to the standard of pruden ce prescribed by NYPMIFA and cons iders the f ollowing factors: the durati on and preservation of the endowm ent fund; NYU's miss ion and the purpose of the endowment fund; general economic conditions; the pos sible effect of infl ation or deflation; t he expected total re turn from income and the appreciati on of investments; other res ources of NYU; where appropriate and circumstances wou ld otherwise warran t, alternatives to expenditures of the endowment fund giving due consideration to the effect that su ch alternatives may have on NYU; and the inv estment pol icy of NYU. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 46 From time to time, the fair value of asset s associated with individua l donor-restri cted en dowment funds may fall below the level that the donor required t o be retained as a fund of perpetual duration. Deficiencies of this nature are reported i n net assets with donor rest rictions. As of August 31, 2020 and 2019, 12 funds and 27 funds, respect ively, with original gift value s of $3,118 and $12,283 were underwat er by $211 and $405.

Commitme nts and Contingencies NYU Langone Hospit als provides emergency department ( ED) services at the site o f the former Long Islan d Colleg e Hospital ED pursuant to an agreement with the State Univer sity of New York ( SUNY ) and a real est ate dev elopment company (the Company ). Pursuant to t he agreem ent with SUNY and the Company, following demolition and remediation of adjacent premises , SUNY will deed the cleared site to NYU Langone Hos pitals at no c ost and NYU Langone Hospitals will construct on the site a four -story medical service s build ing including a freestanding ED . NYU Langone Hospitals received the deed to t he site on March 13, 2020. As of Aug ust 31, 2020, construction i s under way and is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2023. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 47 NYU has ongoing construction projects with contrac tual commitments totaling $617,523 at August 31, 2020. NYU is self -insured for workers' compensat ion. The University purchases an excess workers' compensation insurance polic y with a retention of $500 per cl aim. In connection with being s elf- insured, the University has maintained a surety bond in the amount o f $11,749 at August 31, 2020 and 2019. Additionally, NYU Langone Health has maintained stand -by letters of credit aggr egating approximately $51,905 and $45,674 at August 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. NYU is a defendant in various legal actions arising from the normal cours e of its activitie s and amounts expended under governm ent grants a nd con tracts are subject to audit by governm ental agencies . In addition, amounts received for patient care from Medi care and Medicaid are subject to audit . Although the final outcome of s uch actions and audits cannot be determined, management believes th at eve ntual liability, if any, will not have a material effect on NYU's consolidated balance sheets. 19. Subsequent Events NYU performed an evaluation of subseq uent events through December 11, 2020, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. On September 14, 2020, a lease amendment that had been approved and executed in fiscal year 2018 was effectuated, extending the term of NYUGSoM 's existing lease of 632,628 rentable square feet of admi nistrative offices through 2050 and securing favorable lease terms in connection with the formation of a leasehold condominium . The estimated additional lease liability to be recorded under this agreement is approximately $382, 700. HHS issued new r eporting requirements for the Provider Relief Fund on Septem ber 19, 2020, which it updated October 22, 2020. HHS also issued additional frequently asked question (FAQ) guidance affecting reporting requirements on October 28, 2 020. Under these r eporting requirement s and additional F AQ guidance, HHS may recoup amount s distributed in excess o f actual healthcare related expenses attributable to coronavirus and lost patient care revenue compared to 2019. Due to these new report ing requirements and FA Q guidance, there is at least a reason able possibility that amounts reco rded under CARES Act fund ing may change in future periods. On October 8, 2020, C MS amended the repaym ent te rms for the Medicare advance payments. The revised rec oupme nt period is set t o commence one year after receipt of t he advances. Recoupment shall occu r via offsets to Medicare payments. The offset shall commence at 25% of Medicare payments for the fir st ele ven months of the recoupment period, and then increase to 50% of Medicare pay ments for th e next s ix months . On Oct ober 28, 2020, NYU Langone Health received $110,300 as an expe dited payment from the New York State Division of Homeland Security and E mergency S ervic es related to its submission of a FEMA COVID -19 pr oject worksheet. NYU Langone Health is in the process o f reviewing eligible expenses to r econcile the amount recei ved with expenses incurred and the amount of revenue that will be recognized cannot be asce rtained at this time. New York Univers ity Notes to C onsolidated Financial S tatements August 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands of dollars) 48 Events Subsequent to Original Issuance of Financial Statements (Unaudited) In connection with the reissuance of the consolidated financial statements, NYU has evaluated subsequent events through June 24, 2021, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be reissued. In April 2021, NYU Langone Health System, Inc. entered into a non -binding letter of intent with Brookhaven Memorial Medical Center, Inc. (d/b/a Long Island Community Hospital (\"LICH\")) concerning a potential affiliation transaction and is working actively to negotiate and complete documentation of the proposed transaction. LICH is an acute care hospital licensed to operate 306 beds located in Suffolk County. Completion of the proposed affiliation with LICH is subject to successful comp letion of negotiations between the parties, financial due diligence, approval by the various governing boards, and regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that such negotiations will be completed or that all necessary approvals will be obtained. 20. Financial Responsibility Standard NYU participates in federal Ti tle IV student financial assistance programs, which require it to meet standards of financial responsibility based on criteria determined by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), as set forth in 34 CFR 668.171. The criteria for private institutions includ e the annual calculation by ED of a financial responsibility composite score, as further outlined in 34 CFR 668.172, using audited financial statements submitt ed through ED's eZ -Audit system. The composite score has been and will continue to be based on three ratios: Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net Income. Inputs related to property, p lant, and equipment, net and long-term debt are divided between pre - implement ation, consisting o f the prior year audited financial statement amount, and post - implementation, consisting o f property , plant and equipment, net and long-term debt acquired during fiscal year 20 20, the period in which the financial composite s core regulat ions in 34 CFR 668.172 were implemented.

Basis of Pr ese ntation The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (\"the Schedule\") presents the federal grant a ctivity of New York University (\"N YU\") an d is presented on the accrual basis of account ing. The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements of the Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and therefore, some amounts may differ from amo unts presented in, or used in the preparation of NYU's consolidat ed financial statement s. Negative am ounts represen t adjustments or credits to amount s reported as expenditures in prior years arising out of the nor mal cours e of business . CFDA numbers and pass- through numbers are provided when available. The research e xpenditures for direct costs are recognized using th e cost accounting principles contai ned in OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Inst itutions, and OMB Uni form Guidance, where app licable . Under those cost principles, certain types of expenditures are not allowed for reimbursement . In additi on, expenditures include a portion of cos ts associated with general School activities (facilities and adminis trative) which are allocated to f ederal awards under negotiated formulas commonly referred to as facilities and admini strative rates (also under the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and OMB Uniform Guidance, where applicable). NYU, with the exception of NYU Langone Hospitals , excluding N YU Langone Hospital -Long Island, as described in Note 3, does not use t he 10% de- minimis indirect cost rate for spon sored programs. 2. Superstorm SandyAs described in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidate d financial statements , as a re sult of Superstorm Sandy , NYU L angone Health sustained widespread damage to the main ca mpus facilities including NYU Langone Hospital's in patient and outpatient facilities and the NYU GSoM research, faculty group clinical prac tice and education facilities , all of which were tempor arily closed . Under Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEM A\") reg ulations, NYU Langone Health qualified for funding as a private non-profit facility that s upplies critical services to the communi ty. For Superstorm S andy, FEMA ( through the U.S . Department of Homela nd Security) reimburses eligible entities at 90% of all e ligible c osts awarded. In 2014, FEMA awarded N YU Langone Health a fixed, capped Public As sistance Grant (\"Capped Grant\") totaling $1, 088,252,436, which i ncludes a reduction of $3,383,139 due to a com mercial insurance claim recovery . The award is t o be spe nt over a 7 year performance period for acti vities covered in the agreed upon scopes of w ork. The $1,088,252,436 will be subject to offset for future commercial insurance recoveries r elated to prope rty damage. All reimbursement under the Capped G rant is passed through from New York State to the Univ ersity, to NYU Langone Health. Included in the Schedule are $17,920,911 of NYU Lan gone Health expenditures under the Capped Grant . In 2013, NYU L ango ne Health received $179,394,000 of expedited funding under their ini tial FEMA Project Wor ksheet applica tions, which is separate funding f rom the FEM A Capped Grant . These Project Worksheet s are subject to revi ew and finalization by FEMA . The expenses associ ated with these Project Worksheets are included i n the S chedule in the year the Project Worksheets ar e approved. Included in the Sched ule are $5,063,263 of NYU Langone Health expenditures related to these P roject Works heets , of which $4,638,6 02 were incur red in prior fiscal years but approved in 2020.New York University Notes to Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Aw ards Year Ended August 31, 2020 93 3.

The criteria for private institutions include the annual calculation by ED of a financial responsibility composite score, as further specified in 34 CFR 668.172, using the institution 's audited financial statements submitted with the annual Uniform Guidance (UG) report through ED's eZ -Audit system. The composite score is based on three ratios: Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net Income. Effective September 1, 2019, NYU is required to report the inputs used to calculate these three ratios as a disclosure in the UG report.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to these matters. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In plan ning and performing our audit of the financ ial statements, we cons idered NYU's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing the audit procedures that are appropriat e in the circ umstances for t he purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of NYU's internal control. Accordingly, we do not exp ress an opinion on the effectiveness of NYU's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatemen ts on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control suc h that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial s tatemen ts will not be prevented, or detect ed and corrected on a timely basis. A s ignificant def iciency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by thos e charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given the se limitations, during our audit we did not identify any PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers Center, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY T: (646) 471 3000, F: (813) 286 6000, www.pwc.com/us 98 deficiencies i n internal control that w e consider t o be material weaknesses.

Compliance and Othe r Matters As part of obtai ning reasonabl e assuranc e about whether NYU's financ ial state ments ar e free from material misstatement, w e perform ed tests of its compliance with c ertain provisions of laws, r egulati ons, contracts and grant ag reements, noncomplianc e with whic h coul d hav e a d irect and material effect o n the financial state ments. How ever, provi ding an opinio n on compliance wit h thos e provisions was not an objec tive o f our audit, and accordingly, w e do not ex press suc h an opinion. The result s of our tests disclos ed no instan ces of noncomplianc e or other matters that ar e requi red to be report ed under Government Auditi ng Standards. Purpose of this Report The purpose o f this report is solely t o descri be the scope of our testi ng of internal cont rol and compliance and t he results o f that testing, and not to provi de an opini on on t he effectivene ss of t he entity's internal control or o n compliance. This report is an i ntegr al part of an audit perform ed in accordance w ith Government Audi ting Standard s in considerin g the entity's intern al control and compliance. Accordingly, this communic ation is not suitabl e for any other purpose. New York, New York December 11, 2020, except for footnote 20 to the consolidated financial statements and with respect to the opinion on the schedule of financial responsibility data, as to which the date is June 24, 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Pricewa terhouseCoopers Center, (813) Report of Independent Auditors on Compli ance with Requirements That Could Have a Direct and Material Effect on Each Major Program and on Internal Control Over Compl iance in Ac cordance with the Uniform Guidance To the Board of Trustees of New York Univer sity Report on Compliance for Each Major Fede ral Program We have audited New Yo rk University and its subsidiaries' (\"NYU\") compliance with the types of compliance requir ements described i n the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and materia l effect on each of NYU's major federal pr ograms for the year ended August 31, 2020. NYU's major federal programs a re identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Management's Respo nsibi lity Management is responsibl with federal stat utes, regul ations and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal pr ograms. Auditor s' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on complianc e for each of NYU's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of comp liance requirements referred to ab ove. We conducted our audit of compliance in accord ance with auditing s tandards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standard s applicable to financial audi ts cont ained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U .S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirem ents fo r Federal Awards (Uniform G uidance) . Those standards and the Uniform Guida nce require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain rea sonable ass urance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requireme nts referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a maj or federal program occurred . An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence abo ut NYU's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we c onsider ed necessary in the circumst ances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program . Howeve r, our audit does not provide a legal determination of NYU's compliance. 100 Opinion on Each Major Federal Program In our opini on, NYU compl ied, in all material respects, w ith the types of compliance requirem ents referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on e ach of its major federal programs for the year ended August 31, 2020. Other Matters As indicated in Part I to the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, we have audited the Student Financial Assistance cluster as a majo r program . Also, as indicated in the first paragraph of this report, we performed our audit of compliance using the compliance requirem ents contained in the OMB Compli ance Supplement, including those contained in Part V 5.3, Compliance Requirement N, Special Tests and Provisions, Section 10 \"Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act -Student Information Securit y.\" This section includes three su ggested audit procedures with respect to veri fication that the institution (1) desig nated an individual to coordinate the informati on security program, (2) performed a risk assessment that addresses the three required areas in 16 CFR 314.4(b), and (3) documented a safe guard for each risk identified. Our procedures in relation to these th ree items were limited to inquiry of and obtaining written representation from management and obtaining and reading management's document ation r elated to these three items. Our p rocedures did not include an analysis of the adequacy or completeness of t he risk assessment performed or the safeguards for e ach risk identified by management. Report on Internal Control Over Compl iance Management of NYU is responsible for establi shing and maintaining effective internal contr ol over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered NYU's internal control over c ompli ance with the types of requir ements that could have a direct and material e ffect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropri ate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for ea ch ma jor federal program and to tes t and report on internal control over complia nce in accordance with the Uniform G uidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinio n on the effecti veness of internal control over compliance. Accordi ngly, we do not expre ss an opinion on the effectiv eness of NYU's internal control over complianc e. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operati on of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, nonc ompliance with a type of complianc e requirement of a federal program on a timely bas is. A mate rial weakne ss in internal control over compliance is a deficien cy, or combinati on of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material n oncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a feder al 101 program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis . A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a d eficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of c ompl iance r equirement of a federal program that is less severe than a mater ial weakness in internal control over compliance, yet imp ortant enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our cons ideration of internal control over compliance wa s for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not des igned t o identify all deficiencies in inte rnal control over complianc e that might be material weaknesses or signific ant deficiencies . We did not identify any deficie ncies in internal cont rol over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses . However, material weaknesses may exis t that h ave not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control ove r compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that tes ting based on the requirements of the Uniform Gui dance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
