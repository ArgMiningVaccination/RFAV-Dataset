In the earlysixteenth century, this union fractured, due in part tothe work of a German monk named Martin Luther.Luther had striven to guarantee his salvation throughascetic practices but slowly came to believe thatsalvation can come only through the grace of God,not through any human effort. This fundamentalprinciple of Luther's thought, \"salvation by gracethrough faith alone,\" diverged from the traditionalRoman Catholic belief that both faith and humaneffort are necessary for salvation. The other funda-mental principle of Luther's thought, that the Bible isthe sole rule of faith and the only source of authorityfor doctrine, contrasts with the Roman Catholicreliance on both the Bible and tradition. Luthertranslated the Bible into German and, thanks to therecent invention of the printing press, it was distrib-uted widely and became a best-seller. The availabilityof a Bible in the language of the common people,coupled with Luther's idea of the Bible as the solesource of authority, marked the beginning of a signifi-cant shift away from Rome as the final source of reli-gious authority for many Christians.The Lutheran Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions Edited by Deborah Abbott Revised by Paul Nelson Contents The Individual and the 4 Patient-Caregiver Relationship Family, Sexuality, and Procreation 6 Genetics 12 Organ and Tissue Transplantation 14 Mental Health 15 Medical Experimentation 15 and Research Death and Dying 16 Special Concerns 19 Part of the \"Religious Traditions and Healthcare Decisions\" handbook series published by the Park Ridge Center for the Study of Health, Faith, and Ethics THEPARKRIDGE CENTERDeborah Abbott, M.P.H., formerly with the Park Ridge Center, is currently affiliated with Georgia State University. Paul Nelson, Ph.D., is Professor of Religion and Chair of the Department of Religion at Wittenberg University.THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS 2Luther first presented his ideas publicly in 1517, when he nailed to the church door inWittenberg his Ninety-five Theses protesting the corruption he saw reflected in both theteachings and the practices of the RomanCatholic church. Although Luther was not thefirst reformer of the church in this era, manycite the posting of his theses as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, which ultimatelyresulted in the formation of many non-RomanCatholic, or Protestant, churches in northernand western Europe. In 1530, the Germanprinces who supported Luther presented to theHoly Roman Emperor the Augsburg Confession,an official statement of Lutheran faith; followingthat event, congregations identified with Luthercould formally be called \"Lutheran\" churches. Soon thereafter, Lutheranism spread throughout Germany, Sweden, Denmark,Finland, Iceland, and Norway, and in the mid-seventeenth century, to the American colonies.Today, Lutheranism in the United States is divided among two large and seven relativelysmall denominational groups. The largest, theEvangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), has 5.3 million members in more than 11,000 congregations; approximately 270 hospitals, nursing homes, and other social service organizations are affiliated with theELCA. The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod (LCMS), which is more conservative than theELCA on many theological and moral issues, has 2.6 million members in more than 6,000congregations. Collectively, the smaller Lutheranchurches have about half a million members in 1,700 congregations (Nelson 1991: 123). FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS CONCERNING HEALTH CARE Lutherans as a group do not hold distinctive views on health care or healing. In manyrespects, including their acceptance of modernmedicine, Lutherans blend in with the largelysecular culture (Marty 1986: 18). They havetraditionally built hospitals and been open to scientific developments and cures, but thoseendeavors and attitudes have not retained aspecifically Lutheran flavor (Marty 1986: 171,18-19). Luther himself respected doctors and promoted close working relationships betweenthem and pastors in caring for the sick. Heexpected doctors to identify and treat medicallythe natural causes of sickness, but he believedthat more underlay sickness than a doctor couldaddress (Lindberg 1986: 177-78). Luther sawillness as both a result and a sign of that whichseparates humans from God (Marty 1986: 48)and understood the meaning of suffering, bothpersonal and social, as somehow tied to God'sdecision to redeem sinners and the worldthrough the death of Christ on the cross(Lindberg 1986: 176-77). The first draft of a proposed ELCA social statement understands \"healing in terms ofGod's work of creating, redeeming, and sustaining humankind\" (ELCA 2001b: 4).\"Providing good quality health care for all is a social obligation and responsibility compelledby justice\" (ELCA 2001b: 9). indefensible\"and calls for reforms that would assure\"universal access to a comprehensive decentminimum of health care for all persons\" (ELCA2001b: 9-10). The draft does not stipulateparticular mechanisms for achieving universalaccess but encourages ELCA members to \"vigorously and wisely . . . in the publicdiscussion on how best to fulfill this obligation\"(ELCA 2001b: 10). These matters are exploredin an ELCA congregational study booklet, Our Ministry of Healing: Health and Health CareToday , prepared by the task force that drafted the proposed social statement (ELCA 2001d). The LCMS, generally leery of an emphasis on \"social ministry\" lest it obscure the central focuson proclaiming the Gospel and administeringthe sacraments, nevertheless directs attention tothe church's \"communal Christian care.\" Parishnurse programs are identified as one of its possible expressions in a study document titledFaith Active in Love: Human Care in theChurch's Life (LCMS 1999: 29). INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE Issues of institutional authority and individual conscience are rooted in Lutheran ethics, whichis inseparable from Lutheran theology.According to Lutheran pastor and writer Edward Schneider, \"A basic word in the vocabulary ofLutheran theology is the word 'and.' Ourtheology speaks of law andgospel, of the believer as saint andsinner. It insists upon faith andwork. It deals with the kingdom of God andthe kingdom of the world. The genius of this theology is its ability to dialecticallyrelate aspects of the faith which often tend to be separated and thereby deprived of their full meaning\" (Schneider 1990: 15). This\"both/and\" approach shapes the way Lutheransexercise their conscience in this imperfect world.Lutheran professor of religion Paul Nelson haswritten, \"The sober recognition that we are lessthan perfect people living in a far from perfectworld, along with the conviction that we are,nevertheless, forgiven sinners are the twobenchmarks of a Lutheran moral vision. The former precludes self-righteousness and underlies the sense that often we can do littleelse but choose between greater and lesser evils.The latter makes choice and action possible despite the attendant ambiguities\" (Nelson1993: 151). A statement by the ELCA empha-sizes this point when it says that Christians mustface complex ethical decisions \"in all theirambiguity, knowing we are responsible ulti-mately to God, whose grace comforts, forgives,and frees us in our dilemmas\" (ELCA 1992: 1). Lutherans, like other Protestants, emphasize the importance of individual conscience overinstitutional authority, but \"Luther makes noclaim that one's natural sense of right andwrong is uncorrupted\" (Schneider 1990: 16); the potential for error within individualconscience is tempered by the Scripture asunderstood in the Lutheran tradition. Thefollowing statement by the American LutheranChurch, one of the bodies that merged to form the ELCA, emphasizes the importance of subjection to God's law: \"One remains subjectto God's law not only for one's personal goodbut for the good of the entire body of Christ. A caring community cannot sanction or condonea situation where each member does whatappears good, right, and self-satisfying simply inthat member's own eyes. No one can be a lawsolely to self; each lives in relationship withothers\" (ALC 1980: 10). Lutheran church bodies in the United States often issue statements or other documents thatreflect internal deliberation on moral and ethicalissues of importance to church members. Theseare normally designed to educate and guidemembers in developing their own positions onissues. Within a particular church, various docu-ments may differ in the degree to which theyreflect the \"official teaching\" of the church.Sometimes the churches publish works by asingle author which are intended to provide information and encourage reflection but do notrepresent an official position of the church. Thehistory of mergers within the Lutheran churchmay also complicate the status of various state-ments. For example, the ELCA was formed in1988 by the merger of the Lutheran Church inAmerica (LCA), the American Lutheran Church(ALC), and a smaller body, the Association ofEvangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC). The ELCA elected to accept and encourage the continued use of the \"social statements\" issuedby the ALC and LCA while it developed its ownteachings (Nelson 1991: 123), and continues to use these statements as \"part of the basis ofELCA advocacy on health care\" (ELCA 2001d: 52). Statements by the ALC and LCA, althoughthose churches no longer exist, will therefore be cited here when the ELCA has not made a statement on a particular topic or when an ALC 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERLutherans generally favor open communica- tion between caregiver and relationship between patients and providersshould be . . . a partnership of trust in pursuit of a shared goal\" (ELCA 2001b: 7). Patientshave the final authority to decide among theirmedical options, but they also have an obliga-tion to evaluate those options within a broadcontext, considering the effects of their decisionson other people. According to the first draft of a proposed ELCA social statement, \"our individual autonomy must . . . be understoodwithin the context of our obligation to seek tobe obedient to the will of God, because ulti- mately we belong to God and our exercise ofself-determination should always be understood within that relationship\" (ELCA 2001b: 12). CLINICAL I SSUES Self-determination and informed consent Lutherans, consistent with their general respect for medicine and informed decision making, arelikely to favor self-determination and informedconsent. As a proposed ELCA social statementputs it, \"health care professionals and patientsdeliberate together on the facts and valuesrepresented by options for treatments and care,with patients making free and informed consent 4 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSor LCA statement adds significantly to the substance of an ELCA statement. Social state-ments \"represent the official policy of the churchand are considered binding on staff members andothers who may speak on behalf of the church\"but are not binding on individual churchmembers (Nelson 1991: 128). A formal statementby the ELCA explains the standing of social statements in this way: Because they view issues from the perspective of the Church's faith, social statements are clearlyrooted in the biblical and confessional witness ofthe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.They are subject again and again to the testing of whether they are faithful to Scriptures as \"theauthoritative source and norm of [this church's]proclamation, faith and confessions (ELCA, themselves are parenthetical references are tothe ELCA's constitution.] Church members are called upon to give social statements serious consideration as they form theirown judgments. In their use as teaching documents, their authority is persuasive, not coercive. Theirteaching function builds upon and seeks to nurture the freedom of Christians to decide and act respon-sibly. Social statements help shape the conscienceof Christians by appealing to their faith, moralconvictions, and reason. The respect they evokecomes from the truth and wisdom they embody,which has stood the testing of various forumswithin this church and to which testing they alwayscontinue to be subject. Their effective teachingsignificance will be determined by the intrinsicquality of their contents and by their use in thechurch. (ELCA 1989: 6) Within the LCMS, the Commission on Theology and Church Relations has issued a number of reports on medical ethical issues;while they are not themselves the official posi-tions of the synod, they do reflect the synod's positions. Substantive documents that provideinformation and guidance for synod members and others who are grappling with the issuesaddressed, they are quoted extensively here. Only synodical conventions have the authority to estab lish official positions of the church (personal communication, David Mahsman,Director of News and Information, LCMS). THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIPto whatever services are to be received\" (ELCA 2001b: 7). An earlier statement by the LCA islargely consistent with this view but describes apossible exception: \"To treat a patient in viola-tion of his or her deeply held, carefully consid-ered, and clearly expressed preferences is to doviolence to that person. . . . At the same time, itmust be emphasized that pain and other factorsoften distort the decision-making process,resulting in expressions of preference that maynot represent a person's true wishes. In suchcases, it may be appropriate to administer treatment (by authority of court order, if necessary) if so doing would sustain the life of the patient\" (LCA 1982: 5). The LCMS recognizes that \"Christians who have had different specific experiences may at times disagree concerning application of principles to specific cases\" but affirms that,within the synod, \"agreement exists on thefundamental guiding principles,\" including thecommitment to care and not to kill. Within theframework of those guiding principles, theLCMS honors individual conscience and self-determination. \"Christians have numerousreasons to seek effective ways to assist theirloved ones and their health care team in determining their wishes concerning healthcare\" (LCMS 1993: 21-22). Truth-telling and confidentiality \"Central to [the provider-patient] relationship is respecting patient confidentiality and privacy of medical information\" (ELCA 2001b: 7). A companion study guide to the LCA's 1982social statement Death and Dying discussed truth-telling and confidentiality in this way: In any community that respects other people and is sensitive and responsive to their needs, truthful-ness and faithfulness are crucial. Lying or other-wise resorting to deception is to manipulate othersrather than relate to them as persons. It is to viewthem as adversaries rather than as friends andneighbors. Withholding information fromsomeone\u2014particularly information relating to thatperson's life\u2014is to erect a barrier that gets in the way of the honesty and openness essential tofellowship and human community. None of this, of course, is to suggest that informa- tion should indiscriminately be made available toanyone who wants it. There are many situations,including doctor-patient relationships, in whichkeeping faith with others means maintaining strictconfidentiality about certain matters. . . . However,it is an equally serious breach of faith to withholdfrom a patient information needed to make deci-sions about his or her life or to prepare for death.(Lee 1983: 15) A 1992 statement by the ELCA, which draws upon the LCA statement, states that \"truthful-ness and faithfulness in our relations with othersare essential to the texture of human life\"(ELCA 1992: 2). In the same spirit, an earlystatement from the ALC illustrates the negativeeffects of failing to tell the truth when a personis dying: \"[often] the dying person experiencesdeath as a tragic comedy, supported by a cast ofactors and actresses playing deceptive roles in aconspiracy of silence\" (ALC 1977: 7). No official statement by the LCMS was found. Proxy decision making and advance directives Lutheran statements tend to support the use of advance directives and the ability of people tomake informed decisions about the care of thosewith whom they have close relationships.According to the ELCA, \"Advance directives are welcome means to foster responsible decisions at the end of life\" (ELCA 1992: 4). An earlierstatement by the LCA addressed at greaterlength the issue of proxy decision making: \"If the situation involves a child under the ageof majority, who is therefore legally incompetent,or a person who is mentally impaired and henceunable to participate fully in the decision-making process, a shared decision-makingprocess is preferable. Collective wisdom is likelyto result in better decisions, and no one should 5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERExpressing well the Lutheran view, the LCA has stated that \"sex, marriage, and family are gifts of God in which to rejoice. Their essential goodness cannot be obscured by any crisis of ourtime\" (LCA 1970: 1). Contrary to the view thatcelibacy is preferable to marriage, Lutherbelieved that marriage is a very important vehicle through which to create a sense ofcommunity (Lindberg 1986: 181); but he did notbelieve that marriage is a sacrament, because it does not confer grace (Marty 1986: 130). The LCA characterized marriage this way: \"Christian faith affirms marriage as a covenantof fidelity\u2014a dynamic, lifelong commitment ofone man and one woman in a personal andsexual union. . . . Marriage is not simply a legaltransaction which can be broken when theconditions under which it was entered no longerexist. It is an unconditional relationship, a totalcommitment based on faithful trust. This unionembodies God's loving purpose to create andenrich life. As the needs of the partners change,the covenant of fidelity must be renewed byGod's grace and continually reaffirmed by husband and wife\" (LCA 1970: 1-2).Sexuality, when expressed appropriately, is viewed positively in the Lutheran tradition. AnLCA statement affirmed that \"human sexuality is a gift of God for the expression of love andthe generation of life. . . . In the expression ofhuman sexuality, it is the integrity of our rela-tionships which determines the meaning of ouractions. We do not merely have sexual relations;we demonstrate our true humanity in personalrelationships, the most intimate of which aresexual\" (LCA 1970: 1). The ALC stated moredirectly, \"We believe that Scripture sets the stan-dard of a lifelong monogamous marriage of oneman and one woman. We believe that sexualintercourse reaches its greatest potential onlywithin the committed trust relationship ofmarriage\" (ALC 1980: 5). The ELCA maintainsthe positive Lutheran view of sexuality: \"Weaffirm that the goodness of sexual intercoursegoes beyond its procreative purpose\" (ELCA1991: 4). Sexual intimacy outside of marriage is discouraged: \"Marriage is the appropriatecontext for sexual intercourse. This continues tobe the position of this church\" (ELCA 1991: 4). 6 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSbe left to bear alone the full burden of deciding. Participants in this decision-making process may include family members, the physician andother health care professionals, the pastor, andothers close to the person\" (LCA 1982: 3). Thestatement continued, \"A particular responsibilityof each individual is making treatment prefer-ences known, after careful consideration, so asto facilitate the decision-making process andrelieve the burden on others. Living wills . . .represent one way of doing this\" (LCA 1982: 7). The LCMS concurs in its approval of advance directives and proxy decision making: \"It isgood ethical procedure for the doctor to requestand receive a statement signed by the patient, ifcompetent to consent, or by the nearest of kin,agreeing to the uselessness of further 'heroic efforts' and consenting termination of treat-ments\" (LCMS 1993: 22). The synod recognizesthe complexity of medical decision making andencourages people to seek God's guidance:\"People who know themselves to be redeemedby Christ seek to make the right rather than thewrong decisions for His sake and for the benefitof their neighbor. How else should we seek tobring God's love and care to our neighbors?Right or wrong ethical decisions, of course, donot make us right or wrong with God\u2014we live bygrace\u2014but people who live by grace ponder God's guidance and seek principled ways to apply that guidance to the complexities of life ina world made difficult by sin\" (LCMS 1993: 30). FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONThe ELCA is nonetheless in the process of debating its traditional position on homosexu-ality and homosexual practices. While no newofficial position has been issued, a formalprocess of study and deliberation is under way. With respect to procreation, the ALC concluded, \"Thus, while 'be fruitful andmultiply' still expresses the collective humanobligation to reproduce and thereby perpetuatethe human species, procreation is not an obliga-tion of sexual intercourse. Rather, it is a privi-lege and gift from God to be used responsibly[and] appropriately\" (ALC 1977: 3). The LCMS takes a similar view on marriage, sexuality, and procreation: \"We honor God andthe neighbor rightly when we . . . regardmarriage as a divine, lifelong institution,ordained by of man . [and] affirm God's engaged in only between a manand woman committed to a complete and life-long sharing of their lives with one another in a marriage covenant not to be broken . . . andaffirm that this union of mutual love is the onlyproper context for human procreation\" (LCMS1981b: 40). \"The Biblical injunction to 'befruitful and multiply' is to be understood as a blessing as well as a command. It is one ofGod's good gifts to His people, for procreation is an actual sharing in God's ongoing creativeactivity\" (LCMS 1981b: 17). In 1992, the LCMSreaffirmed \"that the synodrecognize homophile behavior as intrinsicallysinful\" (LCMS 1992, Res. 3-12A) and, insupport of that position, cited a 1981 reportstating that \"the homosexual is held accountableto God for homosexual thoughts, words, anddeeds\" (LCMS 1981b: 35). In 1996 the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of the LCMS published a studydocument, Christians and Procreative Choices: How Do God's Chosen Choose? Organized around four case studies involving surrogacy,artificial insemination by a donor, in vitro fertilization, and voluntary thedocument sought to model While itaffirmed the denomination's previous positions, it recognized that conscientious Christians withinand outside the LCMS disagree about the moraljustifiability of various reproductive technologies.The document's specific concerns and judgments are discussed below. CLINICAL I SSUES Contraception Contraception is generally acceptable to Lutherans. The ELCA has said, \"Wheneversexual intercourse occurs apart from the intentto conceive, the use of contraceptives is theresponsibility of the man and of the woman\"(ELCA 1991: 4). In addition, the ELCA \"recog-nize[s] the need for contraceptives to be avail-able . . . and for of contraception\" (ELCA 1991: 8).A expressive statement was issued by theALC in 1977: \"Effective birth control methodsfacilitate responsible procreation and greatlyenhance the ability to exercise stewardship ofgenetic resources. Enjoyment of sexual inter-course without fear of unwanted pregnancy isappropriate. Men and women are equallyresponsible for contraception and procreation.Sexual intercourse is the privilege of maturepersons acting responsibly within the context[of] a commitment known in the Christiancommunity as marriage. However, contraceptiveinformation and assistance should also be available to all sexually active persons, regard- less of age or marital status\" (ALC 1977: 3-4).According to the LCA, \"The ethical significance of the use of any medically approved contracep-tive method within a covenant of marital fidelitydepends upon the motivation of the users. A responsible decision for or against having achild will include evaluation of such factors as the health of the potential mother, a reliableprognosis concerning the health of a possiblechild, the number and spacing of other children, the family's economic circumstances, and therapid growth of population. People have a rightnot to have children without being accused of 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS 8selfishness or a betrayal of the divine plan; and every child has a right to be a wanted child\"(LCA 1970: 5). The LCMS accepts the appropriate use of birth control but cautions against its perpetual use: In the absence of Scriptural prohibition, there need be no objection to contraception within amarital union which is, as a whole, fruitful. . . . With respect to voluntary childlessness ingeneral, we should say that while there may bespecial reasons which would persuade a Christianhusband and wife to limit the size of their family,they should remember at all times how easy it isfor them simply to permit their union to turninward and refuse to take up the task of sharing inGod's creative activity. Certainly Christians will not give as a reason for childlessness the sorrystate of the world and the fear of bringing a childinto such a world. We are not to forget the naturalpromise embedded in the fruitfulness of marriage.To bear and rear children can be done, finally, as an act of faith and hope in the God who haspromised to supply us with all that we \"need tosupport this body and life.\" (LCMS 1981b: 19-20) In a more recent study document, the LCMS admits that \"in special circumstances there canbe reasons childlessness.\" When and childbirth . . . pose a threat tothe health of a woman, or when the probabilityof severe genetic disease afflicting a potentialchild becomes known,\" a Christian couple may conclude that \"they will better serve God andtheir neighbors by choosing not to have chil-dren\" (LCMS 1996: 32). Sterilization Statements about sterilization by the ELCA andits predecessors tend to be tentative but notnegative; for example, \"We recognize the need . . sterilization to be considered\" (ELCA 1991:8) and \"In defining the acceptable limits ofcontrolling reproduction, we agree that volun-tary sterilization may be an appropriate option\"(ALC 1980: 6).The LCMS view is similar, but the synod is much more explicit about the conditions underwhich the procedure may be appropriate:\"Sterilization may under some circumstances bean acceptable form of contraception. . . . Thereshould be no moral objection to it, especially forcouples who already have children and who nowseek to devote themselves to the rearing of thosechildren, for those who have been advised by a physician that the birth of another child would behazardous to the health of the mother, or forthose who for reasons of age, physical disability,or illness are not able to care for additional chil-dren\" (LCMS 1981b: 19-20). The church's 1996study document appears to reaffirm this position. NEW REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES Artificial insemination Artificial insemination by a husband (AIH) is not problematic among Lutherans; however,artificial insemination by a donor (AID) is causefor moral concern within the ELCA and hasbeen rejected by LCMS. The ALC stated, \"Artificial insemination, . . . in which only one of a couple (the woman in present circumstances)provides genetic material and other geneticmaterial comes from an anonymous donor,becomes a consideration for some married couples. There are, however, such moral,emotional, and legal ambiguities that must betaken into account as to render the proceduresuspect for a Christian\" (ALC 1980: 6). According to one critical study, published in a 1986 joint LCA-ALC pamphlet series,Procreation Ethics, \"AIH presents few legal, social, or ethical problems\" (Schneider 1986: 5).In contrast, \"AID is not an ethically acceptablealternative to childlessness in the case of maleinfertility\" because of psychological difficultiesand because the donor \"exercises his procre-ative powers apart from any marital bond orcommitment. . . . By the introduction of donorsemen, AID separates procreation from marriageand thereby violates the marriage covenant\"(Schneider 1986: 11, 12). The author concludes that \"a couple who find themselves childlessbecause of male infertility are better advised either to come to terms with their childlessnessor to seek children through adoption\"(Schneider 1986: 13). Likewise, the LCMS Commission on Theology and Church Relations has implicitly approvedAIH but cautioned that it \"may be a way ofavoiding underlying psychological problems within a marriage rather than treating them\"(LCMS 1981b: 38). It has also rejected AID onthe grounds that \"the process of fertilization isremoved from the personal context of the one-flesh union of husband and wife in a way thatnot even their consent can allow\" (LCMS 1981b:39). In a 1996 study, the LCMS finds that AIDsubjects marital partners to \"psychological andemotional risks\" and puts children \"at risk ofwondering what significance, if any, is to befound in the hiddenness of their relationship totheir biological father\" (LCMS 1996: 22). Thesame considerations apply to human egg andembryo donation. All are to be rejected. Gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer (GIFT) No Lutheran statements on gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer were found; presumably, indi-vidual synods' positions would mirror their posi-tions on AIH or AID, depending on whether ornot the sperm and egg came from the husbandand wife. In vitro fertilization (IVF) The Lutheran Council in the USA (LCUSA), formerly a cooperative agency of the LCA, ALC,and LCMS, issued a study document circa 1983entitled In-Vitro Fertilization . The eleven study participants \"unanimously concluded that IVFdoes not in and of itself violate the will of God as reflected in the Bible, when the wife's eggand husband's sperm are used\" (LCUSA n.d.:31). indisagreement with other members of thecommittee, held that IVF is unobjectionableonly when the sperm and egg come from husband and wife and all of the fertilized eggsare implanted in the womb of the wife. Theyalso objected to \"experimentation with, destruc-tion of, or storage of unneeded or defectivefertilized eggs\" and \"interruption of an IVFpregnancy for any reason other than to preventthe death of the mother\" (LCUSA n.d.: 31-32). The LCMS Commission on Theology and Church Relations is \"reluctant to locate theproblems that arise [in IVF] simply in themedical technique itself and to suggest thatChristians could never faithfully use it\" (LCMS1996: 37). Nevertheless, the church is troubledabout the potential for abuse. \"When embryosexplicitly created from within a marriage aredenied the possibility of nurture in the wombthat God created to receive them, then theunique and sacred expression in the embryo ofthe one-flesh union of marriage is subject todistortion and diminution\" (LCMS 1996: 39). Surrogate motherhood In an essay on surrogate motherhood, publishedas part of the LCA-ALC pamphlet series, theauthor states that \"wholesale condemnation maynot be appropriate, but Christian perceptions ofthe significance of human procreation and itsplace within the marital relationship are notcompatible with the basic premise of surrogatemotherhood: that one could deliberatelyconceive and bear a child with no commitmenteither to the child or to its father\" (McDowell1986: 10). LCMS representatives to a pan-Lutheran committee studying in vitro fertilization objectedto the use of surrogate wombs in IVF procedureson the grounds that it \"involves the intrusion ofa third party into this one-flesh union [i.e.,marriage] and is contrary to the will of God\"(LCUSA n.d.: 31). In its 1996 deliberations onprocreative issues, the LCMS recognized thepossibility for disagreement within its commu-nity of faith. Just as prior documents haveallowed for conscientious disagreement, so thisdiscussion of procreative choices presented 9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER10 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSreasoned positions against third-party intrusion into the marital relationship but left open thepossibility of conscientious dissent. Neverthelessit is clear that the LCMS is worried that surrogacy\"may complicate or interfere with the parent-child relationship\" and \"risks turning a child into a 'project' or 'product'\" (LCMS 1996: 17). Abortion and status of the fetus Abortion has been an issue of great concern among American Lutherans, as in manyProtestant churches, during the past few decades. Delegates to the 1991 biennialChurchwide Assembly of the ELCA approvedthe following statement that generally discour-ages abortion but specifically recognizes possibleexceptions in cases in which the life of themother is threatened, the child was conceivedduring involuntary sexual intercourse, or thefetus has extreme abnormalities: Because of the Christian presumption to preserve and protect life, this church, in most circum-stances, encourages women with unintended preg-nancies to continue the pregnancy. . . . Thischurch encourages and seeks to support adoption as a positive option to abortion. . . . This churchrecognizes that there can be sound reasons forending a pregnancy through induced abortion.The following provides guidance for those consid- ering such a decision. . . . An abortion is morallyresponsible in those cases in which continuationof a pregnancy presents a clear threat to the phys-ical life of the woman. . . . A woman should not bemorally obligated to carry the resulting pregnancyto term if the pregnancy occurs when both partiesdo not participate willingly in sexual intercourse.This is especially true in cases of rape and incest. . . . There are circumstances of extreme fetalabnormality, which will result in severe sufferingand very early death of an infant. In such cases,after competent medical consultations, theparent(s) may responsibly choose to terminate thepregnancy. Whether they choose to continue orend such pregnancies, this church supports theparent(s) with compassion, recognizing thestruggle involved in the decision. Although abor- tion raises significant moral issues at any stage offetal development, the closer the life in the wombcomes to full term the more serious such issuesbecome. . . . This church opposes ending intrauterine life when a fetus is developed enoughto live outside a uterus with the aid of reasonableand necessary technology. . . . Our biblical andconfessional commitments provide the basis for usto continue deliberating together on the moralissues related to these decisions. We have theresponsibility to make the best possible decisionsin light of the information available to us and oursense of accountability to God, neighbor, and self.In these decisions, we must ultimately rely on thegrace of God. (ELCA 1991: 6-7) The LCMS has consistently taken a strong anti-abortion stance. A 1979 resolution on abor-tion stated that \"the living but unborn arepersons in the sight of God from the time ofconception . . . and since abortion takes ahuman life, abortion is not a moral option,except as a tragically unavoidable byproduct ofmedical procedures necessary to prevent thedeath of another human being, viz., the mother\"(LCMS 1979a: 117). A 1984 statement declared,\"Scriptural principles . . . compel us to regardabortion on demand not only as a sin againstthe Fifth Commandment forbidding the destruc-tion of human life, but also as a grievous offenseagainst the First\u2014that we worship the one trueGod and cling to Him alone. The act of abortion clearly manifests a refusal to honor God as theCreator and to seek Him above all else in timeof need\" (LCMS 1984: 32). In 1992, more than95 percent of the delegates at the triennialconvention of the LCMS (Stanich 1992: 734)voted in support of a resolution that restated thechurch's 1979 teaching and called for increased activity in support of it (LCMS 1992: 116). Thesynod again reaffirmed its position and renewedits call to action in 1995 (LCMS 1995: 141). The 1996 study Christians and Procreative Choices affirmed that \"the living but unborn are persons in the sight of God from the time ofconception,\" while admitting that contrary argu- ments based on such biological facts as the highincidence of spontaneous miscarriage, thephenomenon of twinning, and the \"indetermi-nate personhood of the embryo in its earlieststages\" deserved careful attention (LCMS 1996:38). However, subsequent actions by the LCMSin convention are unambiguous. In 1998 the LCMS convention resolved to \"uphold and underscore Christian concern forsanctity of life\" (Res. partial-birthabortion as a barbaric procedure\" (Res. 6-02)(LCMS 1998). The 2001 convention established a standing commission on sanctity of life (Res. 6-01) anddirected synodical presidents to write to thePresident of the United States requesting \"a thorough review and reversal of the Food andDrug Administration's decision to permit the useof the abortifacient drug RU-486\" (Res. 6-02A)(LCMS 2001). Prenatal diagnosis and treatment The ELCA has not directly addressed the issue of prenatal diagnosis and treatment, although itsstatement on abortion (above) indicates that insome cases, prenatal diagnosis may lead to amorally acceptable decision to have an abortion;this suggests that prenatal diagnosis is acceptableto the ELCA. The ALC stated that prenatal diag-nosis was acceptable under some circumstances: Evaluation of a pregnancy-in-process by currently imperfect and imprecise methods (mainly amnio-centesis) is appropriate under some circumstances.This is the case with families with increased genetic risk or with existing children sufferingfrom metabolic or developmental abnormalities.Amniocentesis will help provide data [with] whichto decide for or against abortion, to assuageparental fears, and to facilitate adequate medicaltreatment. It must, however, be questioned as aroutine screening procedure, as a means ofassuring the desired sex of the offspring, whenused against the wishes of a parent, or when abor- tion is the only option offered. (ALC 1977: 4) The Ethics of Prenatal Diagnosis , a pamphlet in the 1986 LCA-ALC series, encouragescaution and medically informed decisionmaking: \"Under current conditions amniocen-tesis, the most fruitful of the diagnostic tech-niques, involves certain serious risks for thefetus. Is the taking of such risks morallywarranted by the concern to prevent possiblegenetic defect or to prepare a family for thepossible birth of a child with genetic disease? . . . Any prudent and morally responsible delib-eration about whether amniocentesis should beundertaken will involve a careful assessment ofthe technique's benefits in relation tothese potential costs\" (Santurri 1986: 6-7). No official statement by the LCMS was found. Care of severely handicapped newborns The LCA is the only constituent body of the ELCA that has officially addressed the topic of the care of severely handicapped newborns. In1982, it held that in the case of \"a newborninfant with serious . strongpresumption in favor of treatment. Exceptionsmight arise in cases of extreme and over-whelming suffering from which death would bea merciful release, or in cases in which thepatient has irretrievably lost consciousness\"(LCA 1982: 4). A pamphlet titled The Nontreatment of Seriously Handicapped Newborns , published as part of the 1986 LCA-ALC series, advocatesequal treatment of all persons regardless of age:\"Our reasons for stopping treatment of handi-capped newborns must hold across the lifespanand must be compatible with reasons fortreating. No one should be treated actively whentreatment no longer does any good. That reason,however, does not single out unwanted infants asnonpersons; it does not regard early human lifeas dispensable or replaceable; and it does notprefer the rights or values of adults to the lives 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERThe ELCA and its predecessor bodies have generally displayed cautious optimism about the possibilities created by new knowledge ofgenetics. \"While we may celebrate the potentialof genetic knowledge, its application presentschallenges that range from interesting questions to troubling personal crises and socialdilemmas\" (ELCA 2001a: 5). These matters areexplored in a book intended for congregationalstudy, Genetics! Where Do W e Stand as Christians? which, though not a statement of church policy, assists readers in facing these challenges (ELCA 2001a). The ELCA has also published a book on human cloning, whichcontains papers presented at a church consulta-tion that brought together persons working ingenetics, theology, ethics, and law (ELCA2001c). This book, too, is intended to fosterindividual and congregational deliberationrather than provide definite answers or set forthchurch policy. The 1998 convention of the LCMS requested its Commission on Theology and ChurchRelations to prepare a study document on theissues raised by human cloning and directedthat special attention be given to issuessurrounding the production and harvesting of human embryos. The resolution stated that the \"Synod convention reject[s] without reserva-tion as contrary to God's Word any technique ormethod of human cloning that results in thedestruction of human embryos or the creation ofhuman embryos for the purpose of harvesting\"(Res. 3-15B) (LCMS 1998). The Commission'sstudy is ongoing at this time. CLINICAL I SSUES Genetic screening and counseling The ELCA has not yet officially addressed the topic of genetic screening and counseling. TheALC was fairly positive about their possibilities:\"The benefit of expert genetic counseling ispotentially very great. . . . As an endorsement ofresponsible parenthood, the church has an obli-gation to foster genetic education of youth andyoung adults, to assist older mothers, familieswith a history of genetic defects, and familieswith abnormal children in obtaining adequateexpert genetic counseling\" (ALC 1977: 4).Similarly, in 1980 the ALC stated, \"Shouldeither partner bear hereditary traits that mightimpose serious genetic difficulties upon their 12 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSand needs of these patients\" (Tiefel 1986: 11). The LCMS document Christian Care at Life's Endstates, \"In respect for our relationship with God and with one another, we are required to give and to receive 'ordinary' care in which the good effects of the treatment are proportionateto the difficulty and inconvenience involved,care that can be provided without imposing anexcessive burden on the patient and on others.We may, and perhaps should, reject 'extraordi- nary' care and in such cases 'let nature take itscourse'\" (LCMS 1993: 20-21). The documentrecognizes that people of faith may disagree intheir application of these principles, butnowhere does the document indicate that newborns are to be treated differently fromothers. In the case of severely handicappednewborns, as in the case of all severely compro-mised individuals, those involved in makingdecisions should \"ponder God's guidance andseek principled ways to apply that guidance tothe complexities of life in a world made difficultby sin\" (LCMS 1993: 30). See \"Death andDying,\" below, for additional discussion ofLCMS principles. GENETICSchild, we encourage them to seek competent genetic counseling\" (ALC 1980: 6). A pamphlet titled Genetic Screening and Counseling , published in the 1986 LCA-ALC Procreation Ethics series, emphasizes respon- sible use of genetic knowledge, which, in theauthor's view, may include an obligation not toprocreate: \"Responsible use of our geneticknowledge in screening and counseling for theprevention of unnecessary suffering is in accordwith God's purposes. However, . . . it is alsopossible and even likely that sinful humanbeings will misuse the knowledge they gain or be misguided in their application of that knowl- edge\" (Childs 1986: 7). \"Christian couplesfacing the risk of severe genetic disorders intheir children need to consider their obligationto forego the freedom to procreate, and notgamble with the odds in order to prevent unnec-essary suffering\" (Childs 1986: 9; see also ELCA2001a: 26-32). As indicated above (under \"Contraception\"), the LCMS recognizes that Christian couples mayconscientiously choose not to have childrenwhen there is a probability of severe geneticdisease (LCMS 1996: 32). See also \"Prenataldiagnosis and treatment,\" above. Sex selection A 1977 statement by the ALC asserted thatprenatal diagnosis must \"be questioned . . . as a means of assuring the desired sex of theoffspring\" (ALC 1977: 4). Because of its strong opposition to abortion and its insistence that all eggs fertilized in vitrobe implanted in the mother's womb, the LCMS would almost certainly oppose any efforts toselect the sex of a particular child when thedestruction of an embryo would result. Selective abortion No official statements specifically addressingselective abortion were found. The 1986pamphlet The Ethics of Prenatal Diagnosis states a presumption against abortion but argues thatin some cases abortion is a permissible way to\"care\" for the severely handicapped:For certain diseases detectable in utero [such as Tay-Sachs disease] the prospective symptoms are so harsh that it is meaningful to speak of selectiveabortion not as the abandonment of parental care,but quite the contrary, as the very manifestation ofsuch care. At the same time, there are othergenetic afflictions [such as Down's syndrome] inrelation to which an argument for genetic abortionis not so easily made\u2014if it can be made at all.. . . Finally, there will be borderline cases (neuraltube afflictions) where there is enormous variationin degree of severity and where the exact degreein a given case cannot be projected by the appro-priate prenatal tests. Given a moral presumptionagainst fetal destruction, perhaps the reasonablechoice under such conditions of uncertainty is to forego the abortion option in the hope that atolerable existence will be achieved. (Santurri1986: 10; see also ELCA 2001a: 26-32) The LCMS would strongly disagree with the assertion that abortion could be an acceptableway to \"care\" for any human fetus; instead, itwould argue that \"since abortion takes a humanlife, abortion is not a moral option, except as atragically unavoidable byproduct of medicalprocedures necessary to prevent the death ofanother human being, viz., the mother\" (LCMS1979a: 117). See also \"Prenatal diagnosis and treatment\" and \"Abortion and the status of the fetus,\" above. Gene therapy In June 1983, the presiding bishop of the LCA,James R. Crumley, Jr., and 57 other religiousleaders issued a resolution asking Congress toforbid genetic engineering of human germlinecells. Crumley told reporters, \"There are someaspects of genetic therapy [for human diseases]that I would not want to rule out. My concern isthat someone would decide what is the mostcorrect human being and begin to engineer thegermline with that goal in mind\" (as quoted inNelson 1991: 127-28). While sharing Crumley's concerns, the author of the LCA-ALC pamphlet Genetic Manipulation expressed much more optimism: 13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERBoth the LCA and the LCMS have issued statements encouraging organ transplanta- tion under certain circumstances. CLINICAL I SSUES Issues concerning recipients No official statements from any Lutheran churches were found concerning recipients of transplants. Issues concerning donors Although the ELCA has not yet addressed thisissue, the LCA was very positive about organand tissue donation: \"The Lutheran Church inAmerica recognizes that the donation of renew-able tissue (e.g., bone marrow) and live organs(e.g., a kidney) can be an expression of sacrifi-cial love for a neighbor in need [and] encour-ages its members to consider the possibility oforgan donation and to communicate their wishesto family members, physicians and health careinstitutions\" (LCA 1984: 2). Similarly, in 1981 the LCMS adopted a reso- lution that encouraged churchwide educationabout organ and tissue transplants, includinginforming members of \"the opportunity to sign aUniversal Donor Card (which is to authorize theuse of our needed organs at the time of death in order to relieve the suffering of individualsrequiring organ transplants),\" and \"encourage[d]family members to become living kidneydonors\" (LCMS 1981a: 204). Procurement from cadaveric and living donors \"The Lutheran Church in America regards the donation of cadaver organs as an appropriatemeans of contributing to the health and well-being of the human family\" (LCA 1984: 2). See \"Issues concerning donors,\" above, for the LCMS position on the procurement oforgans from cadaveric and living donors. Procurement from anencephalic newborns and human fetuses No official statement from any Lutheran synod was found. The LCMS would almost certainlyobject to procurement from anencephalicnewborns or human fetuses if death were theresult. It has resolved to \"reject without reser-vation . . . any technique or method of humancloning that results in the destruction of humanembryos or the creation of human embryos forthe purpose of harvesting\" tissue or organs fortransplantation (Res. 3-15b) (LCMS 1998). 14 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS\"New tools for dealing with nature may be means by which God is using us to work atbringing back the whole created order into linewith God's own purpose. The Christian isinclined , therefore, to underscore the promise rather than the peril of new discoveries. . . . [T]he drive of Christianity toward the futureredemption of all things would seem to suggestthat those who oppose the procedure be askedto present solid reasons for that opposition\"(Burtness 1986: 10).Although the LCMS has not issued any offi- cial statements on gene therapy, the Commissionon Theology and Church Relations is currentlydiscussing the issue. ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION15 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERLuther believed that mental and physical health are interrelated: \"With regard to depression Luther recommended not onlyScripture and prayer, but good company, goodfood and drink, music, laughter, and if neces-sary, fantasies about the other sex! . . . one point: 'Our physical healthdepends in large measure on the thoughts of ourminds'\" (Lindberg 1986: 182). The ALC issued a paper calling on the church to be more responsive to people with mentalillnesses. It emphasized that Christians shouldnot judge those with mental illnesses or viewmental illness as God's punishment but ratheroffer care and support to the mentally ill andtheir families (ALC n.d.). The first draft of aproposed ELCA social statement maintains that\"[m]ental health services must be fully incorpo-rated within health care services. The sufferingcaused by mental illness\u2014to both sufferers andloved ones\u2014is not only debilitating but is inten-sified by the labeling, isolating, and moral blamethat often accompanies it\" (ELCA 2001b: 6). At its 1995 synod convention, the LCMS adopted a resolution \"that the Districts of theLutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod identify indi-viduals and/or establish a Task Force on MentalIllness within each District to address theconcerns/needs of persons with serious mentalillness and the concerns/needs of families\"(LCMS 1995: 143). CLINICAL I SSUES No official statements from any Lutheran synods were found concerning involuntary commitment,psychotherapy and behavior modification, orpsychopharmacology. Electroshock and stimulation A statement by the ALC affirmed that electro-convulsive shock therapy could be useful undercertain circumstances (ALC n.d.: 3).MENTAL HEALTH According to the first draft of a proposedELCA social statement, \"Research and [the] development of knowledge and new technolo-gies and practices are an essential part of well- coordinated health care,\" and such research isworthy of \"substantial financial investment\"(ELCA 2001b: 8). The LCMS Commission on Theology and Church Relations is currently studying medicalresearch involving human cloning. However,the 1998 LCMS convention rejected thecreation or destruction of human embryos forresearch purposes (Res. 3-15B) (LCMS 1998). Three years later, the convention adopted a resolution on stem cell research. While \"notopposed to all stem cell research as a means ofseeking alleviation for disease\"\u2014the use ofumbilical cord and adult stem cells is unobjec-tionable\u2014the convention found the destructionof human embryos to be \"sinful and morallyobjectionable\" and denounced \"the utilitarianvalues that place possible healing of medicaldiseases over the life of defenseless humanembryos\" (Res. 6-13) (LCMS 2001). MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCHIn the Lutheran tradition, death is not simply a natural event\u2014it is the ultimate result of sin. One prominent Lutheran thinker has put it thisway: \"In the tradition, death is not merely theresult of natural law. It is a crisis, a decisiveevent. I am partly responsible for it. I have takenactions against God\u2014even if I have seemed to be'saintly'\u2014and am thus an agent of what is aheadof me. Somehow what is happening is also mydue. This is a particularly uncomfortable aspectof the Lutheran view of death, but without it thetherapy and affirmation this version of faithoffers is hollow\" (Marty 1986: 165). Not all Lutheran discussions of death empha- size this point, however. For example, the ALC'sprimary statement on death and dying beginswith the sentence: \"Death is a natural event inthe course of human life\" (ALC 1977: 7). In adiscussion of the LCA's 1982 statement, Death and Dying , author Daniel Lee observes that \"being born and dying are part of the dynamiclife processes as God has created them\" (Lee1983: 2). But death is not the end of humanexistence, for \"neither life nor death are [ sic] absolute. We treasure God's gift of life; we alsoprepare ourselves for a time when we may let goof our lives, entrusting our future to the cruci-fied and risen Christ who is 'Lord of both thedead and the living' (Romans 14:9)\" (ELCA1992: 2). The first draft of a proposed ELCAsocial statement goes even further. \"We shouldnot cling to life at all costs, thereby denying thereality of death in our lives and the promise ofsalvation and eternal life\" (ELCA 2001b: 7). The LCMS's 1979 Report on Euthanasia reflects well the traditional Lutheran view ofdeath: \"God created human beings to live andnot to die. Death in any form is inimical to whatGod originally had in mind for His creation. . . . Dying, therefore, is not just another point inthe cosmic process or in the experience ofliving, as it is sometimes made out to be\"(LCMS 1979b: 18). For Christians, death doesnot have the final victory; through the deathand resurrection of Jesus Christ, God has removed the \"sting\" of death and continues toenvelop believers even outside of their mortalexistence (Marty 1986: 159). \"Even as theperson who awakes from a night's slumber is thesame one who went to sleep in the first place, sothe person who lies down to die is the very oneto be awakened to his eternal destiny in theresurrection of all people\" (LCMS 1979b: 21). CLINICAL I SSUES Determining death In 1977 the ALC affirmed that \"definitions of death consist of more than biological facts. Theymust also consider the personal and the spiritualdimensions of life. Since the dimensions ofbiology and personhood are present in everyinstance of life and death, both deserve equalconsideration in any serious attempt to renderdefinition\" (ALC 1977: 7). In a companion study guide to the LCA's 1982 statement Death and Dying , Daniel Lee discusses the technical definitions of death:\"The whole or total brain definition has themost to recommend it. Unlike the upper orhigher brain definition it does not reduce theconcept of death to irreversible loss ofconsciousness. Nor does it violate social sensitiv-ities in the way that the upper or higher braindefinition does. Unlike the spontaneous heart-lung definition it does not run the risk ofdeclaring death when consciousness is stillpossible. And, unlike the more inclusive heart-lung definition, it does not by implication extendthe definition of human life beyond the pointwhere integrated functioning of the organism asa whole is possible\" (Lee 1983: 51). The LCMS, consistent with the foregoing statements, has said, \"When death, therefore, isdescribed only in terms of the total stoppage ofthe circulation of blood and the cessation of theanimal and vital functions, or even as irre- 16 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSDEATH AND DYINGversible coma, that may not say enough. For behind such a statement is a view of human life which identifies it solely with that of the animalkingdom. This does not do justice to the biblicalrevelation. . . . Dying, therefore, is called givingup one's . . The use of the criterion of'brain death' has contributed to a moreconstructive discussion in depth of the subject athand\" (LCMS 1979b: 18). Pain control and palliative care Lutherans generally agree about the importance of pain control, despite its possible risks, andpalliative care. \"Physicians and other healthcare professionals also have responsibility torelieve suffering. This responsibility includes theaggressive management of pain, even when itmay result in an earlier death\" (ELCA 1992: 4).\"Every reasonable effort should be made tocollaborate with patients to alleviate pain\"(ELCA 2001b: 7). \"At the same time, adjust-ments in administering [pain-relieving] drugsshould be made so as not to deprive the patientof consciousness prematurely\" (LCA 1982: 5).\"When artificially-administered nutrition andhydration are withheld or withdrawn, family, friends, health care professionals, and pastorshould continue to care for the person. They areto provide relief from suffering, physicalcomfort, and assurance of God's enduring love\"(ELCA 1992: 3). The LCMS takes a very similar stance: \"Administering pain-killing medications, even at the risk of shortening life, is permissible, sincethis does not entail the choice of death as eithera means or an end\" (LCMS 1993: 5). Death as a\"solution\" to suffering is never an option in theLCMS; instead, suffering gives Christians the opportunity to practice their faith throughcaring: \"In Christ we discover that we need notflee from the sufferer whose suffering resistsalleviation and explanation. Our baptismconcretely witnesses to Christ's presence with usand gives us strength in the presence ofsuffering\" (LCMS 1993: 25).Forgoing life-sustaining treatment The first ELCA social statement indi- cates that \"when death is likely or imminent, apeaceful death should become the goal of ahealth care system, sought as confidently andcompetently as other goals through adequatepalliative care and services such as hospice.Our health care services should not abandonthose who are dying\" (ELCA 2001b: 7). TheELCA and its predecessor bodies support the right of persons to forgo life-sustaining treat- ment, including nutrition and hydration: \"Foodand water are part of basic human care.Artificially-administered nutrition and hydrationmove beyond basic care to become medicaltreatment. Health care professionals are notrequired to use all available medical treatmentin all circumstances. Medical treatment may belimited in some instances, and death allowed tooccur. Patients have a right to refuse undulyburdensome treatments which are dispropor-tionate to the expected benefits\" (ELCA 1992:3). In such cases, the patient should be theprimary decision maker, but all decisions shouldbe made in consultation with others who are directly consider person [who iscapable of participating] mandates that he orshe be recognized as the prime decision-maker'in treatment. The patient is a person in relation-ship, not an isolated individual. Her or his deci-sions should take others into account and bemade in supportive consultation with familymembers, close friends, pastor, and health careprofessionals\" (ELCA 1992: 1). A 1993 report issued by the LCMS stated that \"when the God-given powers of the body tosustain its own life can no longer function anddoctors in their professional judgment concludethat there is no real hope for recovery even withlife-support instruments, a Christian may ingood conscience 'let nature take its course'\"(LCMS 1993: 5). Likewise, a 1995 resolutionopposing legalization of assisted suicide said, 17 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER\"We respect the individual's right to refuse treat- ment or to forbid life-support systems by a priordirective and to be allowed to die\" (LCMS 1995:141). Disagreement exists within the synod overwhether artificially administered nutrition andhydration constitute \"ordinary\" (necessary) or extraordinary care for someone in a persistentvegetative state. The validity of both positionscan be demonstrated given the guiding princi-ples articulated by the LCMS. In such aninstance, individual conscience is respected. Suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia Both the ELCA and the LCMS maintain a strong stand against assisted suicide. The ELCAhas stated, \"As a church we affirm that deliber-ately destroying life created in the image of God is contrary to our Christian conscience. . . . We oppose the legalization of physician-assisted death, which would allow the privatekilling of one person by another. Public controland regulation of such actions would beextremely difficult, if not impossible. The poten-tial for abuse, especially of people who are most vulnerable, would be substantially increased\"(ELCA 1992: 4). The LCMS, consistent with its strong pro-life stance, has condemned death as a means to endsuffering. \"To the dismay and fear of many, theadvocates of euthanasia, as well as of assistedsuicide, have sought to justify the taking ofhuman life on moral grounds by describing it asa truly compassionate act aimed at the relief ofhuman suffering. In light of what the Scripturessay about the kind of care God wills that weprovide to those who suffer and are facingdeath, we reject such claims as neither compas-sionate nor caring. Christians aim always to care, never to kill \" (LCMS 1993: 3). The LCMS holds that euthanasia and assisted suicide are contrary to God's law (LCMS 1993: 5)and that \"any attempt to legalize assisted suicideis an affront to the Lord, who gives life, and opens the door for abuse and future legislationthat would deny the freedom of many\" (LCMS1995: 143). The synod also maintains that\"Christians are obligated to make their positionknown, by whatever means possible, as a way ofhelping to shape public opinion on the questionof euthanasia\" (LCMS 1993: 31). In 1998 theLCMS convention reaffirmed its rejection of assisted suicide (Res. 6-02A) (LCMS 1998). Autopsy and postmortem care A 1982 statement by the LCA encouraged members to consider authorizing an autopsy ordonating a body for scientific purposes (LCA1982: 7). The LCMS regards the practice of donating one's body for medical research as \"a matter ofindividual conscience\" (Nelson 1991: 139). Last rites, burial, and mourning customs Although cremation has become increasinglyacceptable among Lutherans, it is still aminority practice; most Lutherans are buriedafter death. Burial from a church, rather thanfrom a funeral home, is the traditional practiceof Lutheranism, and one that is once again onthe ascendancy after a period of decline.Lutheran graveside services reflect widely heldChristian beliefs and emphasize both the realityof death and the hope of resurrection (Marty1986: 163-64). Stillbirths The historical Lutheran teaching and practice is to baptize only living persons (LCA 1970: 5); ifthe possibility of life exists in a stillborn, baptismwould be appropriate (Marty 1986: 143). 18 THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS19 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERATTITUDES TOWARD DIET AND THE USE OF DRUGS One author representing the LCA wrote that stewardship of the gift of life \"includes eating balanced diets, exercising regularly andotherwise doing those things that contribute togood health\" (Lee 1983: 12). According to thefirst draft of a proposed ELCA social statement,stewardship of our own health includes \"takingreasonable steps to prevent illness and disease\"and \"engaging in healthy behaviors.\" The state-ment recognizes, however, that \"[d]isability,disease, and illness do happen . . even to are good 10). A 1971 LCMS resolution stated, \"We encourage all people to avoid perverting God'swill by resorting to indiscriminate termination oflife, either directly through such acts as abortionor euthanasia or indirectly through the improperuse of drugs, tobacco, and alcohol\" (Resolution9-07, as quoted in Larue 1985: 63). RELIG IOUS OBSERVANCES Baptism and Eucharist Baptism and Eucharist are the two sacraments in the Lutheran church; most Lutherans arebaptized in infancy. Blessing of the sick Although Lutheranism is a liturgical tradition,\"there is less recourse here than in some othertraditions to the notion of a separate supernat-ural sphere to which the believer seeks accessthrough the use of anointing oils, the laying onof hands, or special prayers of healing designedto induce miracles\" (Marty 1986: 84). Nevertheless, Lutheran interest in liturgies of healing has increased in recent years. The 1982edition of Occasional Services: A Companion to Lutheran Book of W orship , published jointly bythe LCA and ALC, includes two services entitled \"Service of the Word for Healing\" and \"Layingon of Hands and Anointing the Sick.\" Althoughanointing the sick is not a sacrament in theLutheran church as it is in the Catholicchurches, these services do display a sacra- mental quality (Ballard 1987: 20). The use ofliturgies for healing is encouraged in the firstdraft of a proposed ELCA social statement(ELCA 2001b: 13). Holy days Like many Christians, Lutherans observe litur-gical festivals and designate certain days in commemoration of saints, martyrs, and othernotable Christians. Unlike the Roman Catholicchurch, the Lutheran church does not consider these occasions \"holy days,\" nor does it recog-nize \"feasts of obligation.\" Each Sunday is theLord's Day. Polity, scripture, and doctrine The ELCA is \"the most liberal of Lutheran church bodies in North America. . . . The church is divided into 65 synods, each headed by a bishop. During the final merger process [in1987], headquarters for the new church wereestablished in Chicago. Administratively, thechurchwide organization is divided into units with particular program responsibilities,\" andthe whole church is headed by a presidingbishop (Melton 1993: 320). The ELCA acceptsthe Bible as the inspired word of God, the threegreat ecumenical creeds (the Apostle's, Nicene, and Athanasian) as declarations of faith, theUnaltered Augsburg Confession as a witness tothe gospel, and the other confessional writingsof the Book of Concord as valid interpretations of the faith. The LCMS is relatively conservative. It main- tains that the Bible is the inerrant Word of Godand it operates with modified congregationalpolity. \"The members' responsibility for congre-SPECIAL CONCERNSgational leadership is a distinctive characteristic of the synod. Power is vested in voters' assem-blies, generally comprised of adults of votingage. Synod decision making is given to the dele-gates at national and regional conventions,where the franchise is equally divided betweenlay and pastoral representatives\" (Bedell 1994:96). In addition to the Bible, the synod accepts all the writings in the Book of Concord as \"a true and unadulterated statement and expositionof the Word of God\" (LCMS Constitution II); theBook of Concord includes the three creeds, the Augsburg Confession,Luther's Small THELUTHE RANTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSAmerican Lutheran Church. n.d.

Increasingly, health-care workers face the challenge of providingappropriate care and services to people of differentreligious backgrounds. Unfortunately, manyhealthcare workers are unfamiliar with the reli-gious beliefs and moral positions of traditions other than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of differ-ent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and adminis-trators in their decision making and care giving. It can also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the history of the tradition, including its perspectiveson health and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Finally, each booklet offers information on spe-cial concerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral decisionsabout clinical issues to individual conscience. Wewould therefore caution the reader against gener-alizing too readily.The guidelines in these booklets should not substitute for discussion of patients' own religious views on clinical issues. Rather, theyshould be used to supplement information coming directly from patients and families, andused as a primary source only when such first-hand information is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practitioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefs play a part in the way patients dealwith pain, illness, and the decisions that arise inthe course of treatment. Greater understanding of religious traditions on the part of careproviders, we believe, will increase the quality of care received by the patient.
