I knew I was dying. The first thing I noticed was that I was still alive. I was still there, just outside my body! This was the reaction of Dr. Lotte as she came close to death in the ER in 1992. She then developed a serious blood disorder and walked a fine line between life and death for several years. Two years later as she struggled to heal, she again left her body, which resulted in a spiritual transformation and activated her life path. As a result of these experiences, she became clairvoyant, clairaudient and clairsentient. She was then guided to attend medical school as well as become an author and evidential medium. In 2012 at the age of 54, she left her job as a sales manager in the bio-tech industry in San Francisco and moved to Tempe AZ to attend medical school. Dr. Lotte was an atheist before having her near-death experiences and it took her a quarter of a century to understand her newfound gifts. She works as a physician in her clinic and as a spiritual healer and educator outside her practice. She provides hope and healing and creates peace and happiness in your mind, heart, and soul. Her book Med School after Menopause, The Journey of My Soul is available on Amazon and is an inspirational story about transformation, healing, and spirituality.
