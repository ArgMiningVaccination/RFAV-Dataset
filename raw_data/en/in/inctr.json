The first initiative to set up a council was taken by the His Highness the Maharaja of Travancore, in 1944. The Travancore Medical Practitioners' bill was discussed in the Legislature and formally passed as Act No.VII of 1119 on 1st Chingam 1119 (Corresponding to 17th August 1943). The Travancore Medical Council comprising of seventeen members from various disciplines viz. Allopathy (Modern Medicine), Ayurveda, Siddha Vaidya, Unani and Homeopathy was formed under this Act. The Act was named the Travancore Medical Practitioners Act. After independence this Act was replaced by Travancore Cochin Medical Practitioners Act, 1953. Thus Kerala State Medical Council is the successor body of the erstwhile Travancore Cochin Medical Councils established by the TCMP Act, 1953.
