This pilot study was a survey-based study conceived as a descriptive analysis of real-life experiences with herb-drug interaction from the perspective of herbalists, licensed health-care providers, and lay persons. Reported dietary supplement-drug interactions were evaluated against the resources most commonly cited for the evaluation of potential supplement-drug interactions. Disproportionality analyses were performed using tools available to most clinicians using data from the U.S. Federal Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the US Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS). Secondary aims of the study included exploration of the reasons for respondent use of dietary supplements and qualitative analysis of respondent's perceptions of dietary supplement-drug interaction. While agreement among reported supplement-drug interactions with commonly cited resources for supplement-drug interaction evaluation and via disproportionality analyses through FAERS was low, agreement using data from CAERS was high.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-28", "cleaned_text": "Everyday Evaluation of Herb/Dietary Supplement-Drug Interaction: A Pilot Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines10030020](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines10030020) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicines-10-00020)]. [2](#B2-medicines-10-00020)]. This broad definition encompassed more than 80,000 products available for sale in the United States in 2018 [ [3](#B3-medicines-10-00020)]. [3](#B3-medicines-10-00020)]. The botanical dietary supplement industry in the United States is expanding rapidly. In 2020, retail sales of herbal dietary supplements in the US exceeded $12 billion, representing a nearly 10% increase from 2019 [ [4](#B4-medicines-10-00020)]. Several thousand new botanical dietary supplement formulations enter the market each year [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00020)]. [6](#B6-medicines-10-00020)]. Nearly 70% of those reporting use of herbal dietary supplements reported concomitant prescription medication use, and nearly 64% reported use of over-the-counter medications. Respondents with comorbid states including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, pulmonary disease, obesity, arthritis, and history of stroke reported a significantly higher prevalence of herbal dietary supplement use than those without illness, increasing the likelihood of dietary supplement in conjunction with prescription medications. [7](#B7-medicines-10-00020), [8](#B8-medicines-10-00020), [9](#B9-medicines-10-00020), [10](#B10-medicines-10-00020)]. In their 2022 study, Prely et al. reported that 40-83% of oncology patients use complementary and alternative medicines during cancer treatment, particularly herbal dietary supplements [ [9](#B9-medicines-10-00020)]. In a survey of 806 oncology patients, Alsanad et al. reported that 53.7% were taking combinations of dietary supplements and prescription medications [ [11](#B11-medicines-10-00020)]. The authors identified 167 potential supplement-drug interactions that affected nearly 14% of respondents; the potential for herbal dietary supplement interaction with narrow therapeutic index cancer agents is particularly alarming [ [12](#B12-medicines-10-00020)]. [13](#B13-medicines-10-00020)]. Concomitant herbal dietary supplement use by those taking prescription medication ranges from 20 to 35%, which poses a significant potential risk of clinically relevant interactions between medications and dietary supplements [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. It is estimated that up to 70% of patients using dietary supplements do not report such use to their health-care provider, thereby decreasing the potential for prevention of harm from such interactions [ [15](#B15-medicines-10-00020)]. Furthermore, many health-care providers are unaware of the potential for interaction, which is due in part to a dearth of clinically relevant evidence [ [8](#B8-medicines-10-00020), [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020), [16](#B16-medicines-10-00020), [17](#B17-medicines-10-00020)], variability [ [9](#B9-medicines-10-00020), [18](#B18-medicines-10-00020), [19](#B19-medicines-10-00020)], and lack of training in this area [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020), [16](#B16-medicines-10-00020)]. In their 2022 investigation of ten popular herbs' interactions with cancer treatment drugs as reported to the World Health Organization's adverse event reporting database known as Vigibase, Pochet et al. estimated that 5% of reported herbal dietary supplement-drug interactions could have been avoided if a reliable published source was available [ [20](#B20-medicines-10-00020)]. [21](#B21-medicines-10-00020)], although manufacturers must provide \"reasonable safety data\" for products introduced to market after 15 October 1994 [ [17](#B17-medicines-10-00020)]. It is important to note that such data are not required for products introduced prior to the adoption of the DSHEA [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. The US FDA bears the burden of proof to deem a specific product is unsafe; however, since 2007, manufacturers of dietary supplements are required to report serious adverse effects to the US FDA, and manufacturers of dietary supplements are required to follow current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) guidelines [ [22](#B22-medicines-10-00020)]. The cGMP guidelines aim to ensure overall product quality by setting standards for accuracy of labeling, minimal standards for manufacturing, guaranteed absence of certain (but not all) contaminants, and availability of records for inspection. However, the guidelines are nonbinding on the manufacturer, and botanical supplements may vary substantially in composition [ [23](#B23-medicines-10-00020)]. A DNA-based analysis of 44 herbal products from 12 companies performed by Newmaster et al. found that 59% of the samples contained DNA from plant species not listed on the label, nearly 33% contained contaminants or fillers not listed on the label, and product substitution was found in over 65% of tested samples [ [24](#B24-medicines-10-00020)]. In a recent review of 107 case reports of herb-drug interactions, contaminant causality was likely in at least one case [ [25](#B25-medicines-10-00020)]. Additionally, the US DSHEA prohibits dietary supplement labeling from claims related to disease treatment or diagnosis, products are often labeled with vague monikers such as \"thyroid support formula\". This further complicates the interpretation of case reports of HDI. [9](#B9-medicines-10-00020), [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020), [20](#B20-medicines-10-00020)]. Factors including the part of the plant used, geographic location, time of harvest, age of plant, specific cultivar or species used, and secondary stressors may alter the nature of the secondary metabolites responsible for alteration of drug action [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00020), [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. The handling of crude plant product post-harvest, misidentification of species, and method of extraction may similarly impart significant inconsistency in product [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. The combination of botanic species in formulated products only amplifies this variability [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. Variations in processing may further complicate matters for both botanic and non-botanic dietary supplements, creating a wide variability in organoleptic characteristics, altering native chemical constituents, and sometimes adding potentially harmful solvent residues. Fortunately, the application of metabolomics in the pharmaceutical industry is an emerging technology that may help standardize the nature and identification of product characteristics in the future [ [26](#B26-medicines-10-00020), [27](#B27-medicines-10-00020), [28](#B28-medicines-10-00020)]. [29](#B29-medicines-10-00020)]. The aforementioned variabilities in botanic product composition present major limitations to the reproducibility of studies of potential herb-drug interactions. In any experimental approach, authentication and phytochemical characterization are imperative to assure that the product being tested is appropriately identified and unadulterated, preferentially through the independent verification of labeled phytochemical content claims [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. [8](#B8-medicines-10-00020), [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020), [30](#B30-medicines-10-00020)]. In vitro studies can offer valuable mechanistic insight into interactions, particularly those at the level of pharmacokinetic interaction. However, results from in vitro assays often diverge from the clinical realities of herb-drug interaction. Depending upon the study design, influences on drug disposition related to the induction of a transporter or enzyme may not be identified. The water solubility of many phytochemicals is poor, resulting in limited intestinal absorption and/or extensive first-pass metabolism; thus, in vitro assays often examine supraphysiologic concentrations of constituents [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020), [27](#B27-medicines-10-00020)]. The use of solubilizing agents and solvents, ionic influences, and changes in pH may alter the effects observed on the target enzymes and transporters [ [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020), [27](#B27-medicines-10-00020)]. In vitro studies examining the impact on metabolic enzymes cannot simulate the myriad of factors that may impact pharmacokinetic drug disposition due to factors such as phytochemical metabolites, interaction with the microbiome, protein binding, uptake/efflux transporters, and other factors. Similarly, those studies looking at the impact on transporters cannot simulate the impact from metabolic drug-drug and herb-drug interaction [ [9](#B9-medicines-10-00020), [16](#B16-medicines-10-00020), [32](#B32-medicines-10-00020)]. Polymorphisms in genes coding for transport proteins and enzymes may not be present in a relatively small homogenous population [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00020)]; thus, such influences from gain-of-function mutation on herb and drug disposition will not be detected. Often, in real-world reports of herb-drug interaction, the overuse of the herbal supplement leads to an effect that might not occur with normal exposure levels [ [17](#B17-medicines-10-00020)]. Pharmacokinetic pathways for most constituents of herbal products are not known, and the influence of prescription drugs on herbal product disposition is often overlooked [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00020)]. Additionally, statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters may not lead to clinically significant impact [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00020)]. Quite often, clinical studies of the same botanical produce conflicting results when performed by different researchers, which is perhaps due in part to differences in product formulations [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00020)]. [8](#B8-medicines-10-00020), [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. The application of artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing offer exciting potential for risk evaluation; however, these tools are not generally available at the clinic level and still require significant labor for data extraction [ [20](#B20-medicines-10-00020)]. Pragmatic trials are needed to discern real-world risks and benefits of herbal supplement-drug interaction [ [8](#B8-medicines-10-00020)]. In addition to providing widely applicable and relevant outcome data, pragmatic trials are ideal to evaluate complex interventions applied in a multidisciplinary fashion [ [33](#B33-medicines-10-00020)]. Until such trials are available to inform clinical decision making, health-care providers must triangulate available information to discern the best approach to optimize patient-centered care for the burgeoning number of patients who elect to include herbal and other dietary supplements. Herb-drug interaction databases often derive their data from various types of studies with their accompanying limitations. Thus, providers must combine personal clinical experience, data from case reports, data from primary literature, and information from herb-drug interaction databases to evaluate potential benefits and risks. 2. Results 2.1. Summary Statistics from Survey [Figure 1](#medicines-10-00020-f001)displays the credentials associated with the respondent's role as they interacted with patients; several respondents were associated with more than one credential. Seven HCP/H provided the zip code where they observed most HDI, with three reporting from the mid-Atlantic states and one each from the southeastern US, western US, southwestern US, and New England. Too few respondents included zip code information, preventing meaningful subgroup analysis by geographic region. [Table 1](#medicines-10-00020-t001)details the HDI experienced and observed. Parameters not specified by survey respondents are identified as \"NS\" and are presented in [Table 1](#medicines-10-00020-t001)to provide a complete quantification of survey results. For example, respondent 131 answered \"yes\" that they had experienced an NDI but did not disclose which supplement or drug and did not specify the reaction; this feature of solicited and spontaneous reports adds to the complexity of interpretation. To help quantify the frequency of observations, HCP were asked how often a particular reaction was observed, which is reflected by the italicized content in the fourth column when specified. 2.2. Reasons for Using HDS [Table 2](#medicines-10-00020-t002)depicts the distribution of response by thematic category and group. 2.3. Source of Knowledge of HDI Mechanisms [Figure 2](#medicines-10-00020-f002)depicts the thematic response as a percentage of all responses. 2.4. Herb-Drug Interaction Checkers and Disproportionality Analysis [Figure 3](#medicines-10-00020-f003)depicts the percentage of citations for all specific sources cited more than once. The category \"other\" includes four unspecified texts, two unspecified online interaction checkers, and one each for PubChem, Micromedex, Examine.com, \"ask Brinker, inference from Medscape drug metabolism, inference from American Herbal Product Association Handbook, RxList, Little Herb Encyclopedia, and I Pro. [Figure 4](#medicines-10-00020-f004)depicts the level of agreement between respondent reports and Drugs.com [ [34](#B34-medicines-10-00020)], Epocrates [ [35](#B35-medicines-10-00020)], Lexicomp Database [37](#B37-medicines-10-00020)], and Stockley's Herbal Medicine Interactions [ [38](#B38-medicines-10-00020)]. [39](#B39-medicines-10-00020)] to evaluate the association of the reported adverse reaction with the HDS for respondent reports containing sufficient information to perform the evaluation. As adverse event reporting databases, beneficial interactions are not reported in the adverse even reporting system and thus were not evaluated. No case reports were found for Rauwolfia serpentina (snakeroot), Medicago 3](#medicines-10-00020-t003), all evaluable herb-reaction pairs were associated with the reported reaction at the pre-defined level of significance. [40](#B40-medicines-10-00020)], which was accessed via the public dashboard. Six HDI reports by respondents presented sufficient information to perform the analysis. As the most commonly used HMG CoA reductase inhibitor [ [41](#B41-medicines-10-00020)], atorvastatin was selected from the HMG CoA reductase (\"statin\") class to evaluate the HDI report involving red yeast rice. No reports involving escitalopram, St. John's wort and serotonin syndrome or alfalfa, warfarin, and decreased INR or clotting were found. Three of the six evaluable HDI reports returned with a significant association, as seen in [Table 4](#medicines-10-00020-t004). 3. Discussion [1](#B1-medicines-10-00020)]. Herb-drug interactions (HDI) were experienced by more than one in ten respondents. While the questionnaire intended to identify adverse HDI, 44.4% of HDI experienced and 26.3% of observed HDI were reported as beneficial. A rapid review of the literature published in PubMed in the last five years keyed to the MeSH term \"herb drug interaction\" found the theme of beneficial interaction reflected in 17 (4.8%) of the 354 articles identified. [21](#B21-medicines-10-00020)]. In this study, several respondents reported that they used HDS because they prefer a natural approach, and several cited the safety of HDS over prescription medications, but only one cited both: \"natural vs synthetic seemed safer and healthier choice\" (respondent 73, layperson). Reasons for HDS use were elicited by a question that asked, \"What factors influenced you to use or recommend/prescribe herbal medicines?\" Respondents preferred supplements because they perceived that supplements are superior to prescription drugs (28.3% of total responses). The reasons for this perception include themes related to natural/not synthetic nature of supplements (13.2% of total responses), increased safety or gentleness of supplements (9.4%), and the ability of supplements to produce effects not seen with prescription drugs (5.7%). As respondent 114 (RN, paramedic) stated, \"botanical medicine can do things that single-entity drugs can't\". Another overarching reason for HDS use reflects the status of health care in the United States (27.4%), with 17% reflecting decreased cost of HDS compared to prescription drugs and 7.5% reflecting mistrust of the medical establishment. Three laypersons specifically pointed at mistrust of physicians, with respondent 124 stating \"doctors don't want to fix what's wrong because it decreases return visits\". While culture/family was cited as only 4.7% of total reasons, four out of five respondents who cited culture/family also cited mistrust of the medical establishment. The only cited reason with a statistically significant response rate difference between HCP/H and laypersons related to autonomy and choice; this was likely due to prescribers citing patient autonomy as a reason for including HDS in the regimen. [32](#B32-medicines-10-00020)]. Regarding knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), respondent 111 (DO) stated that \"I have tried to learn TCM for years, it takes a vast amount of knowledge to function adequately\". Those possessing the \"vast amount of knowledge needed to function adequately\" are often not included during design and implementation of clinical trials, which further complicates the interpretation of the research that has been performed. [35](#B35-medicines-10-00020)]) did not find any of the HDS reported by respondents. All other resources agreed with reports of bleeding from combinations of warfarin with cranberry and Ginkgo and combinations of garlic and aspirin. Disproportionality analysis for bleeding with the HDS alone revealed an association of each with this reaction. The disproportionality analysis from FAERS indicated a signal of disproportionality only with the combination of Ginkgo, warfarin, and bleeding. Similarly, all resources other than Epocrates [ [35](#B35-medicines-10-00020)] cited interaction between melatonin/eszopiclone causing hangover or excessive sedation and between St. John's wort/escitalopram causing the serotonin syndrome; only the former was detected as a significant signal through disproportionality analysis using FAERS data. The Natural Medicine Online Database [ [37](#B37-medicines-10-00020)] was the only resource to agree with the report of Red Yeast Rice/statin causing muscle pain. Disproportionality analysis of FAERS data for this combination (using atorvastatin-related data as baseline) detected a significant signal of disproportionality for this interaction; CAERS also detected a signal of disproportionality for Red Yeast Rice alone in association with muscle pain. [37](#B37-medicines-10-00020)], Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions [ [38](#B38-medicines-10-00020)]) demonstrated the greatest agreement with the reports of experienced and observed HDI. Of the three respondents relying on the Natural Medicine Database, [ [37](#B37-medicines-10-00020)] two were pharmacists, and one was a Naturopathic Physician (ND); the ND and one of the pharmacists were also the two to cite the latter resource. [14](#B14-medicines-10-00020)]. [42](#B42-medicines-10-00020)] and Faillie [ [43](#B43-medicines-10-00020)] for details regarding the limitations of this methodology. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Online Questionnaire 4.2. Evaluation of Herb-Drug Interaction Checking Resources 4.3. Disproportionality Evaluation of Herbal Product and Reaction from CAERS [https://www.fda.gov/food/compliance-enforcement-food/cfsan-adverse-event-reporting-system-caers](https://www.fda.gov/food/compliance-enforcement-food/cfsan-adverse-event-reporting-system-caers)) (accessed on 14 December 2022) was searched for all reports filed between January 2004 and June 2022 was downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet by clicking the \"download CAERS excel\" button. An Excel formula command was applied to the REPORT_ID field to count all unique cases. Herbal product of interest was selected by filtering the PRODUCT field using both common names and scientific name. The CASE_MEDRA_PREFERRED_TERMS (reaction) field was filtered by searching the Medical Data Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms and synonyms for the reported reaction. The number of unique reports of the reaction of interest combined with the herbal product of interest (cases with herb, A) was counted. The number of unique reports for the reaction of interest without the specific herb (cases without herb, B) was calculated by removing the filter for the HDS, using an Excel command to count the unique reports, and subtracting A (the number cases with HDS). Non-cases with HDS (C) were calculated by removing the filter for the reaction field, counting the unique reports using an Excel command, and subtracting the number of unique reports with HDS (A). Non-cases without HDS (D) were calculated by subtracting the number of cases with HDS (A), the number of cases without HDS (B), and the non-cases with HDS (C) from the total number of unique reports in the database. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) was calculated using the formula (A \u00d7 D)/(B \u00d7 C), the standard error (SE) was calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the reciprocals of A, B, C, and D, and the 95% confidence interval was calculated by multiplying ROR by Euler's number to the power of +/1.96 \u00d7 (SE) [ [40](#B40-medicines-10-00020)]. Significance for the signal of disproportionality was predefined as a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval > 1 and at least one case reported in association with the herb of interest. All calculations were performed in Excel. [Figure 5](#medicines-10-00020-f005)offers a graphic overview of the calculation. 4.4. Disproportionality Analysis of Herbal Product with Drug with Reaction of Interest from FAERS [https://fis.fda.gov/sense/app/95239e26-e0be-42d9-a960-9a5f7f1c25ee/sheet/7a47a261-d58b-4203-a8aa-6d3021737452/state/analysis](https://fis.fda.gov/sense/app/95239e26-e0be-42d9-a960-9a5f7f1c25ee/sheet/7a47a261-d58b-4203-a8aa-6d3021737452/state/analysis), accessed on 14 December 2022). The search function was used to identify all reports involving the victim drug in the past five years, using both trade and generic name. Combination products containing the victim drug with other prescription ingredients were not included. Where the number of generic names and trade names exceeded five (the maximum number of allowable items in FAERS), multiple searches were performed. Details of individual reports were downloaded into an Excel file. The results of multiple searches for a victim drug were compiled into a single file. Duplicate reports are removed in FAERS; thus, the identification of duplicates was not needed. The lexical analysis function of MAXQDA20 (Verbi software2020, v2020.1) was used to code each report for the presence or absence of the target herbal product and MedDRA-defined reaction of interest. Mixed method quantizing was used to count the presence or absence of the herb and reaction of interest; quantized results were exported into Excel files. Excel commands were used to count cases where the herb and reaction were present with the victim drug (A), where the herb and drug were present without the reaction of interest (B), where the reaction and drug were present without the HDS (C), and other adverse effect reports of the drug without the presence of the HDS (D). The reporting odds ratio, standard error, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated in Excel and predefined significance for signal of disproportionality as with the CAERS data. 4.5. Analysis of Survey Results [https://www.downloadexcelfiles.com/us_en/download-zip-code-list-united-states-postal-service-usps#.Y6t9QRXMLrc](https://www.downloadexcelfiles.com/us_en/download-zip-code-list-united-states-postal-service-usps#.Y6t9QRXMLrc)) (accessed 14 December 2022). One author (MBB) reviewed open-ended texts to identify themes. Coded and sorted data were exported into Excel for analysis. Pearson's chi square for comparison of reported HDS use between health-care provider/herbalist and lay persons was performed in Excel. Fisher's exact test was performed using the free internet calculator \"Easy Fisher Exact Test Calculator\" [ [44](#B44-medicines-10-00020)] to evaluate differences in frequencies of reported reasons for using HDS between HCP/H and lay persons. In each case, significance level was set at alpha 0.05. 5.
