Title II, Part A : Funds made available under this title shall be used to supplement, and not supplant, non-Federal funds... Title III, Part A : Funds made available under this title shall be used so as to supplement the level of Federal, State, and local public funds that, in the absence of such availability, would have been expended for programs for limited English proficient children and immigrant children and youth and in no case to supplant such Federal, State, and local public funds . 7Statutory Language Texas Education Agency Supplement, Not Supplant Handbook , version 5.0, revised March 2022 ESSER statute has no SNS provision 8 Purpose of Supplement, Not Supplant 9Purpose of SNS Provision The purpose of the SNS provision is to help ensure that federal grant funds are expended to benefit the intended population, 10not diverted to cover expenses that the LEA would have paid out of other funds in the event the federal funds were not available.Traditional SNS Most federal programs with SNS provision still use traditional documentation. Program activities must be used to enhance, expand, or extend required activities.Traditional SNS State/local activitiesTraditional State/local activitiesFederal program activities (supplement state and local)Title III activities (supplement Federal, state, and local.)

The State and LEAs may use these program funds only to supplement and, to the extent practical, increase the level of funds that would, in the absence of federal funds, be made available from non-federal sources * for the education of participating students. In no case may an LEA use these federal program funds to supplant funds from non -federal sources. *Title III, Part A and RLIS must also be supplemental to other federal funds.Traditional SNS Traditional Presumptions of Supplanting An auditor will presume that supplanting occurs if the federal funds \u2014 Provide services/activities required by State or local law; Provide same services/activities as those provided in prior school year with State or local funds; Provide same services/activities in Federal and non-Federal programs.Rebutting the Presumptions of Supplanting The LEA is responsible for providing documentation to rebut a presumption of supplanting. Documentation of rescission of funds or budget reduction. Documentation that prior fund source is no longer available. Written, contemporaneous documentation!Additional SNS provision for RLIS and SRSA funds If the activity is one that would ordinarily be covered with other Federal, State, or local funds (for example, in most cases, standard textbook purchases would ordinarily be covered with State or local funds) \u2014 The LEA would have to rebut a presumption of supplanting through written, contemporaneous documentation (e.g., State or local legislative action, budget information, school board minutes, or other materials) that it would not be able to fund a particular activity in the absence of the RLIS or SRSA funds.Questions to Ask When Planning What program is involved? If it is a program that uses traditional SNS documentation, the LEA should ask - Is the activity/service required by state or local law? Did the LEA provide this activity/service in the prior year? Did the LEA previously use non -federal funds to provide the activity/service? Is the activity/service provided with federal funds to some recipients and with state/local funds to other recipients? If the answer to any of these questions is \"Yes,\" the LEA should consider whether it may need to rebut a presumption of supplanting, or use a different fund source.An LEA wants to purchase 25 new security cameras.

Did the LEA use Title IV funds for cameras at some campuses and state/local funds at others?Traditional SNS Example An LEA wants to purchase 25 new security cameras. Is it all right to use Title IV funds for this? It depends! If the LEA previously purchased security cameras with state or local funds, this could be a supplant. To rebut the presumption of supplant, the LEA must document that the state or local funds are no longer available.Informal (and Unscientific) Polls 32 Question Discussion Time (2-3 minutes) Poll Answer Polling Procedure 33Is it allowable for Title II, Part A funds to be used for the Reading Academies? Question 1 34Traditional SNS precludes Title II, Part A from being used for the Reading Academies in the instances where the academies are a state requirement. Therefore, the only instance where the academies may be considered allowable under Title II, Part A is if an LEA wants to provide the training to non -K-3 teachers. The HB3 state requirement applies only to Principals and K -3 Teachers. Answer 1 35May Migrant Education Program (MEP) funds be used to pay for meals and snacks for migratory students on field trips? Question 2 36If there are no other resources available, MEP funds may be used to pay for the costs of food while the migratory children are participating in the field trip. The LEA must consider the following when determining if they may use MEP funds for a particular activity or (instructional or support) service: 1. The activity or service comports with the results of the State's Comprehensive Needs Assessment (CNA) and the strategies outlined in the State's Service Delivery Plan (SDP). Answer 2 372. MEP funds must first be used to meet the identified needs of migratory children that result from their migratory lifestyle, and to permit these children to participate effectively in school. 3. The activity or service meets the needs of migratory children that are not addressed by services available from other Federal or non -Federal programs. 4. MEP funds are used to supplement, rather than supplant, the use of State and local funds. [i.e., the LEA cannot pay for migrant students with migrant funds and all other students with state/local funds.] Answer 2, continued 38An LEA wants to use its Title III, Part A funds to certify teachers who are on a bilingual exception or ESL waiver . Is this allowable? Question 3 39Title III, Part A funds cannot be used to certify teachers who are on a bilingual exception or ESL waiver because such a certification is a state requirement. Title III, Part A funds can be used to build capacity of bilingual and/or ESL certified staff above state requirements. Before doing so, however, the LEA should ensure that no federal, state, or local funds were used for this purpose in the prior year.

[Section 1118(b)(1)]Title I, Part A SNS Compliance 44An LEA may not be required to identify that an individual cost or service supported with Title I, Part A funds is supplemental.Title I, Part A SNS Methodology State/local activities campus allocations Title I, Part A SNS Methodology Title I, Part A funds State/local activities campus allocations Methodology or Statement of Exemption 47Every LEA that accepts Title I, Part A or School Improvement funds must have either \u2014 A written methodology for allocating its state/local funds A Statement of Exemption from Methodology RequirementTemplates available 48Templates for the SNS Methodology, as well as the Statement of Exemption, are available in the Supplement, Not Supplant Handbook .Primary Title I, Part A SNS Methodology Requirement 49LEA allocates State and local funds to its campuses without regard to their Title I, Part A status.Primary Title I SNS Methodology Requirement 50Title I, Part A neutralTraditional Presumptions of Supplanting... 51The traditional presumptions of supplanting DO NOT APPLY to Title I, Part A!!Questions to Ask When Planning What program is involved? If the answer is Title I, Part A, the LEA should ensure that it has either - A valid written methodology for distributing its state and local funds, OR A Statement of Exemption. If this requirement is met, the supplemental nature of Title I, Part A funds is established, and the LEA should consider the remaining items in the Title I, Part A Use of Funds document.LEA-level Funds 53Assurances in Methodology and Statement of Exemption 54LEA must assure that \u2014 any State and local funds that are retained at the LEA level will be used in a Title I, Part A -neutral manner; and any Title I, Part A funds that are reserved at the LEA level will be used only for Title I, Part A purposes, as indicated in the LEA's approved ESSA Consolidated Federal Grant Application.Informal (and Unscientific) Poll 55 Question Discussion Time (2-3 minutes) Poll Answer Polling Procedure 56Is it allowable for Title I, Part A funds to be used for the Reading Academies? Question 4 57The LEA meets the SNS requirement for Title I, Part A by having a written methodology for allocating its state and local funds to its campuses (or by having a valid Statement of Exemption). The LEA does not apply the traditional presumptions of supplanting to Title I, Part A activities. The LEA would work through the other items on the Title I, Part A Use of Funds one -pager to ensure that the activity is identified in the CNA, is included in the DIP/CIP , meets EDGAR requirements, and is aligned with the LEA's policies and procedures.

LEAs frequently try to apply it to Title I, Part A funds. Traditional presumptions of supplanting do not apply to Title I, Part A. LEAs frequently try to apply them to Title I, Part A. Title I, Part A SNS methodology does not document SNS compliance for other federal programs. LEAs tend to conflate the two systems of documentation. Ineligible for exemption. LEAs sometimes apply exemptions incorrectly.Informal (and Unscientific) Poll 67 Question Discussion Time (2-3 minutes) Poll Answer Polling Procedure 68We were granted the Mentor Allotment last year and were able to pay for mentor stipends. This year, we were not granted the allotment, so may we go back to paying the stipends with Title II funds as in previous years? Question 5 69This would be an example of where the LEA would want to keep documentation showing that the state fund source that had been used is no longer available. (This could be minutes from a board meeting, or from a budget report.) This would be what an auditor would want to see in order for the LEA to successfully rebut the presumption of supplanting. Answer 5 70Informal (and Unscientific) Poll 71 Can Title II Part A split -fund costs with Title I, Part A since Title I, Part A funds can only cover the cost of Title I, Part A schools? [e.g., substitutes for training or programs that are evidence - based ] Question 6 72It would not be a supplanting issue for Title II, Part A funds to replace Title I, Part A funds (or vice versa) because those statutes only require the federal funds to supplement state and local funds --not other federal funds. However, an LEA would want to ensure that it could document that Title II, Part A funds have been prioritized to meet the needs at campuses that have been identified for school improvement and campuses that have the highest percentage of low -income students. If Title II, Part A funds remain after that, then this could be an allowable activity if it meets with LEA policies and procedures. Answer 6 73Title I, Part A funds could be used, as long as the other Use of Funds requirements for Title I, Part A are met (e.g., identified in CNA, included in LEA/Campus plan, in line with EDGAR requirements and local policies). If these are Title I, Part A funds that have been reserved at the LEA level, they would need to be used in accordance with the activities approved in the LEA's Consolidated Federal Grant Application.
