The Chakra system originates from Hindu tradition but have also played an important part in Buddhism. The word Chakra is Sanskrit for \"wheel,\" and is often interpreted more as a vortex or whirlpool in Energy Healing. Even though, there are primary and secondary Chakras, the main focus in Energy Healing is on the seven primary/major chakras, which run up the center of the torso and head and are the main focal points for the meridians, or energy lines, that run through the body. The minor chakras are smaller focal points where meridians cross. All in all, the chakras are points that regulate energy flow. If they are blocked and therefore unhealthy then energy cannot flow freely and that results in physical illness and discomfort. The chakras can be open or closed, depending on how well energy is able to flow through them. Ludmila's healing system concentrates on the removal of toxins out of the energy field that results in the removal of blockages as well as healing and balancing of all the chakras. Chakra Balancing Chakra Balancing is the practice of aligning and harmonizing the seven chakras, or energy centers, in the body. When Chakras are balanced, energy flows freely throughout the body, promoting physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. One of the ways to rebalance your Chakras, is through Energy Healing - Reiki which helps balance the Chakras and promote overall well-being. When all seven Chakras are balanced, you may experience improved physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Some people feeling more relaxed, energized, and focused , others are feeling more connected to their inner selves and the world around them. How do you know if your chakras are blocked?
