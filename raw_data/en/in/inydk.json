One avenue of research has focused on finding ways to immunize patients against the specific cancer growing within them. This approach targets tumour-specific antigens found on the cancer cells.

Antigens are recognized as \"foreign\" by circulating immune cells and thereby trigger an immune response. However, many tumour antigens are altered...
