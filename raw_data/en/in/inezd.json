Professor Moshi Geso from the School of Health and Biomedical Sciences said that he was very impressed with the idea of designing and producing this vaccine, which depends on manufacturing a blade with special instructions to consider the protrusions like those on the body of the Coronavirus as strange and dangerous and must be eliminated. He added, explaining that in the cell there is a particle called (RNA) called the feature of carrying the instruction code (mRNA) that pushes these codes to the immune cells in the body. The scientists placed these coded messages inside a very small nano-fatty particle. The professor emphasized that the use of this technique will remove people's fear about this vaccine. Where he explains how this vaccine works. The immune cells read the code when find bodies with cuneiform protrusions, then they know that they are dangerous and must be attacked and disposed of, so the immune system is ready to get rid of these foreign bodies. The professor concluded that the effect of the vaccine may extend for a year, as the discoverers believe. According to the tests, the effect of the vaccine begins four weeks after taking its dose. - People in Australia must stay at least 1.5 metres away from others.
