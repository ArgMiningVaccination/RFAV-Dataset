Dosha balance occupies a central place in skin health- optimal moisture balance ensured by Kapha balance, prevention of hormonal reactions of the skin by balanced Pitta, and a balanced Vata ensures efficient circulation of blood and nutrients in the skin. Ayurveda can help to delay and reverse signs of aging and promote healthy and youthful skin. - Moringa: Your Daily Dose of Revitality - Moringa has proven to be extremely effective in dealing with anti-aging owing to its detoxifying properties. Moringa can help in controlling acne and fighting blemishes and hyperpigmentation. How to use: Applying a face pack made out of dried moringa powder can help in treating wrinkles, blemishes, and acne. - Ashwagandha: Source of Regeneration and Rejuvenation - Ashwagandha is a superfood that helps in rapid cell regeneration and rejuvenation. It also helps in boosting collagen within the skin by promoting firmness and plumpness of the skin. How to use: Drink a glass of warm milk with Ashwagandha, dried fruits, and nuts before going to bed at night. - Neem: Boosting Collagen Naturally - Neem has excellent anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial properties and is one of the best herbs for improving skin health.
