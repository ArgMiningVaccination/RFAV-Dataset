M/S (Agidius/Westerberg): To go out of Executive Session at 7:00 p.m.. Motion carried unanimously. The regular meeting of the Board convened on Thursday, August 21, 2008 at 8:20 a.m. at Idaho State University in the Rendezvous Complex. Board President Terrell presided and started with opening remarks. Mr. Terrell recognized noteworthy educational achievements, events, and activities that have taken place at the institutions in the past year. He indicated that the Board will be looking at how the Presidents' Council is structured and its function. OPEN FORUM Matt Spencer, Idaho State University Associated Student Body President, welcomed the Board to ISU. He noted that the students are looking to make some changes in the function of the student government at ISU. He offered to host a tour of the campus for any Board member that is interested. Jerry Peterson, Executive Secretary of Southwest Idaho Building and Construction Trades Council, spoke briefly about the current status of the construction industry. He noted that one of the challenges the construction industry faces is a shortage of skilled workers to fill vacant positions. He explained that the skilled trades require additional education, up to four years and/or including apprenticeship. The wages earned by the people in the skilled trades are equal to, and even greater than a number of professions that require academic degrees. He reminded the Board that construction will always be an essential profession. He urged the Board to be aware that the field is in desperate need of educated workers who have been provided opportunities for coursework, degrees, and apprenticeship programs beyond high school. Students need classes in higher level math, science, and technology. State Superintendent Luna invited Mr. Peterson to a meeting that will take place shortly to discuss professional-technical education (PTE) and also current credit courses. Board member Hall indicated that when the Board was discussing high school reform, there was discussion about PTE courses that would be accepted as math credit. Ann Stephens, State Administrator for the Division of Professional-Technical Education, was invited to comment. She discussed the math courses and pilot projects being offered by the the Lewiston school district, Lewis-Clark State College, and the Meridian School district. She reported that a school-to-apprenticeship program is starting and that a number of other efforts are being looked at. Mr. Hall indicated he was hopeful that a math course would be developed for people in the trades and encouraged PTE to work with the Department of Education to develop a senior level math course that would address the needs of the students going into the trades. At this time Mr. Terrell greeted Senator Denton Darrington who was in the audience. BOARDWORK 3 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 BOARDWORK 1.

PLANNING, POLICY, AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 1. Presidents' Council Report Dr. Jerry Beck of the College of Southern Idaho reported to the Board as the Chair of the Presidents' Council. He indicated that at the August 11, 2008 meeting of the Presidents' Council a report was presented by the Idaho Digital Learning Academy (IDLA). The Council acknowledged a need to improve the cooperative efforts between the colleges and universities in terms of IDLA delivery. The Council plans to forward the IDLA report to CAAP to pursue the issues and concerns brought forth. Dr. Beck also reported that the Presidents' Council was updated by the Governor's Nursing Task Force about the needs of the state in that regard. Board member Hall discussed inquiries and frustrations that have been expressed to him from students regarding the transfer of credits; specifically that institutions are not abiding by Board policy to transfer credits between institutions and, in some cases, between programs. Mr. Hall mentioned that he had been contacted by a legislator with concerns about the same subject. Mr. Hall declared that this issue must be addressed and resolved. Board member Agidius reported that he also had received a complaint from an individual who earned a two-year degree at a technical institution, only to be told by a four-year institution that the degree wasn't going to be accepted, and that student would be required to register as a sophomore. State Superintendent Luna indicated he wanted to see a time-frame set for addressing this issue. Mr. Hall noted it is broader than the lower division courses; it applies to the upper level courses as well. BOARDWORK 5 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 Sona Andrews from Boise State University r eported that the Presidents' Council had charged CAAP to look at this issue and that CAAP had involved the registrars in the process. The Presidents' Council expects to have a report for the Board soon. Board member Hall discussed the need to have a uni form numbering system for courses. Dene Thomas, President of Lewis-Clark State College, indicated that the Presidents' Council had looked at common course numbers and found several that weren't in line. Mr. Hall asked that the common course numbering apply to upper level courses as well. By unanimous consent the Board charged the Presidents' Council to bring a full report on the credit transfer subject to the Board in December, 2008. 2. Idaho State University Annual Report Dr. Art Vailas, President of Idaho State University delivered ISU's progress report. He noted that ISU is looking at interdisciplinary research efforts. He discussed how ISU is working to make strategic decisions based on the limited resources. One limiting factor is the shortage of qualified faculty to teach the new and upcoming students in health care professions as well as in related disciplines such as biology. Dr. Vailas discussed medical and health education. He indicated that ISU is working to address issues related to programs, clinical faculty, and affiliation agreements with a number of other sites locally, statewide, and nationally. He pointed out that ISU is restricted in what they can do because of the faculty/student ratios mandated by accreditation requirements. Board President Terrell mentioned the accelerator and asked if it was being used for proton therapy related to cancer research and treatment. Dr. Vailas reported that ISU is doing a tremendous amount of work in that area and ex plained it requires a huge amount of venture capital in order to build the kind of facility necessary to deploy proton therapy. He indicated that ISU is working with a venture capital firm to bring such a unit to this part of the country. ISU is also partnering with the federal government in that area. Dr. Vailas offered to provide follow up information to the Board. Board President Terrell said that would be helpful. Board member Hall asked that a future report be presented on the various efforts and activities related to the health professions accelerator as well as things taking place at the INEL and CAES. Before moving onto the next item, Board President Terrell noted that the Department of Administration wants all of the institutions to determine why they aren't able to tie into a single data base. Board member Hall suggested it would be helpful to have written clarification from the Department of Administration so it is clear what kind of information or response it wants to have. When that is received, it will be forwarded to the Presidents' Council. 3. Commission for Libraries Annual Report Ann Joslin reported to the Board. She noted that the Commission is guided by its vision for the year 2020. Its mission is to assist libraries to build their capacity to better serve their clientele by embracing change. She explained that in t oday's environment, libraries are more relevant than ever because young adults are the most likely users. Ms. Joslin discussed the Commission's strategic issues which included how Idaho libraries BOARDWORK 6 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 position themselves to embrace the future; preparing students for jobs that don't yet exist; professional development opportunities for teacher-librarians; defining the library's identity; and how to sustain an infrastructure that provides services in an atmosphere of change. Ms. Joslin reported that Idaho has moved to a digital repository requirement that replaces the hard-copy repository. This allows for easy access for the public and eliminates the need for more space for hard copies. At this time Board President Terrell introduced Representative Donna Boe in the audience. By unanimous consent, the Board agreed to modify the agenda in order to move item number five of the Instruction, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) agenda ahead of item number one on the IRSA agenda. 4. Family Medicine Residency of Idaho Presentation Dr. Ted Epperly Chair and Program Director of Family Medicine Residency of Idaho addressed the Board. He introduced Dr. Jonathan Cree fr om Idaho State University's Family Medicine program. Dr. Epperly is a physician in Boise, Idaho. He reported that Idaho has a crisis in the production of family care physicians. In terms of workforce generation, 90% of all Idaho counties are short on primary care. Currently Idaho ranks 47 th in the U.S. for the number of primary care physicians. He mentioned the programs in Boise and Pocatello rank 8th in the nation in terms of retention of residents in the state. Dr. Epperly explained that over the past six year s the program has grown, and it continues to build out. A carry-over funding request is in place to use the Governor's millennial funds to help address the need. He referred the Board to the Business Affairs and Human Resources agenda materials for the exact numbers. He thanked the Board for the support of their programs in the past. Dr. Jonathan Cree described the two different approaches that Idaho has. He said that Boise's program is community-based while the program at ISU is university-based. He indicated that efforts are underway by ISU to put a rural health program into place. ISU is currently working to establish a site, but additional faculty will be needed to get that going. Dr. Cree explained that the expansion plans in eastern Idaho are smaller than in the Boise area. Board member Thilo asked how federal funding applies to residency programs. Dr. Epperly indicated that the federal funding of residency programs comes through Medicare. For Idaho that means that about 27% comes from Medicare, 50% comes from patient care, and 8% of the current funding comes from state funds through the Board of Education. They are looking to increase the state funds to 12% in order to increase the size of the program. Dr. Epperly reported that federal funding of the program is fairly stagnant right now and the government appears ready to cut those monies in the fu ture. This will have a very negative impact on medical programs nationally. Dr. Cree reported that the two programs have appeared before the Board a number of times since 1996 to provide progress reports and to request funding. In response to a question from Board member Hall, Dr. Epperly pointed out that he and Dr. Cree last appeared before the Board at its meeting in Twin Falls. In terms of coordination with ISU, Dr. Cree reiterated that he BOARDWORK 7 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 heads up the program at ISU. Dr. Epperly clarified that this effort is a state-related mission and that the Governor asked them to expand, so in good faith they are working towards that end. The two programs do collaborate and coordinate in a number of areas. In addition, both programs are partners with the University of Washington. 5. Idaho State University - Alcohol Waiver Request for 2008 Home Games M/S (Hall/Thilo): To approve the request by Idaho State University to establish secure areas under the conditions set forth in this request for the purpose of allowing pre-game activities for the 2008 home football season.

Motion carried unanimously. Board member Lewis referred to a diagram on Tab 5, page 6 and noted it didn't appear that there were separate access entrances/exits into the area. Board member Agidius indicated that it was his understanding that an adult could take a child into the area, but that a minor could not come in on his own. Mr. Lewis explained that there were instances where that was allowed, but it was an exception to the policy, and not to be considered as the rule. ISU explained there is a fence around the area where alcohol sales will take place and that alcohol must be consumed prior to leaving the area. Board member Hall asked ISU draw in the fence on the diagram, and have that revised diagram attached to the minutes to attest to its presence. 6.

There was a discussion following the original motion related to concerns about serving alcohol during the game and in the stadium. Board member Lewis noted that when the request for Sky Boxes came before the Board previously, similar concerns were expressed. He indicated that as future waivers come forward it may be more difficult to keep what happens in the Sky Boxes separate from what happens in the stadium. Board member Hall referred back to the minutes from March 2005 and the discussion at that time about the sale of alcohol in the Sky Boxes. He noted that the minutes of March 2005 did approve the sale of alcohol sales in some fashion in the Sky Box suites. Mr. Lewis asked if alcohol consumption was critical to the sales of the suites. Gene Bleymeier of BSU indicated it was because it was a factor in how the Sky Boxes were promoted and sold. BOARDWORK 10 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 Mr. Lewis made a substitute motion. 8.

The area is for sponsors to entertain clients/guests for the fall of 2008 home football games, including the sales and service of alcohol. 11. This exception is only for the 2008 football season; the University shall bring the matter back to the Board after the conclusion of the 2008 football season for reconsideration for 2009. 12. Be required to provide a drawing that outlines the University's intent. Motion FAILED unanimously. Board member Hall asked about the difference between UI's request for 3 hours rather than 4 hours. UI agreed to change it to 3 hours. Mr. Hall and Ms. Thilo agreed to that change in their motion. Garrett Albrecht ASBUI President presented this request from the students to have a separate area on campus for those over the age of 21 to purchase and consume alcohol prior to the games. Several Board members voiced a concern that it promotes alcohol use among the students. State Superintendent Luna indicated that his biggest concern is that the student body association is getting into the business of creating and sponsoring events where alcohol is served. 9. Board Policy Section I.M - Annual Planning and Reporting - First Reading M/S (Hall/Agidius): To approve the first reading of the Idaho State Board of Education BOARDWORK 11 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 Governing Policies & Procedures, Section I.M. Motion carried unanimously. 10. College of Western Idaho (CWI) and College of Southern Idaho (CSI) - Accreditation Agreement M/S (Hall/Agidius): To approve the request by the College of Western Idaho to approve the Accreditation Agreement between the College of Western Idaho and the College of Southern Idaho as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. It was noted that representatives from the College of Western Idaho were not available to discuss this request. Dr. Jerry Beck indicated that this effort is a cost-recovery factor, not a revenue generating activity for the College of Southern Idaho. He noted that transcripts, degrees, and student aid will be in the name of the College of Southern Idaho until the College of Western Idaho is able to operate on its own. Board members agreed it would be helpful to have more detailed financial information including fiscal impact statements from both institutions. Board President Terrell asked that the Board be able to see that information before it votes on an MOU. M/S (Terrell/Lewis): To postpone this item to time certain, which will be at the next Board meeting, with the necessary financial information. Motion failed unanimously. Dr. Beck noted that there are two separate issues. One has to do with financial aid and the other has to do with accreditation. This MOU relates to the financial aid piece. If this item is postponed it will make it impossible for CWI to award financial aid for the spring semester. Dr. Beck emphasized that this request is from CWI not from CSI. CSI is not in possession of the financial statements of CWI. Board member Lewis noted that there is a community interest in the College of Western Idaho being successful. The transition path related to CWI's independence would be helpful. Board member Hall noted that in the past the Board hasn't interfered with the agreements between institutions with independent boards and it doesn't appear that the Board should do that now. The Board does not have any real governance over either CSI or CWI. Mr. Lewis noted that this request puts the Board in an awkward position. He suggested that CWI should be asked to come back to present their budget and to answer questions by the Board in the future. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS 5. Update and Recommendations on Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing and Blind/Visually Impaired Service Delivery Model Board member Thilo introduced this information item. Aylee Schaefer from the Board office reported to the Board. Ms. Thilo encouraged the Board members to review the considerable information provided to them in the Board material. She discussed the Summit which took place and noted that a number of recommendations were suggested. Final recommendations have not been compiled BOARDWORK 12 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 as yet, however several themes were identified. Ms. Schaefer briefly highlighted those themes: personnel preparation; family and mentor involv ement; full continuum of services for children and youth; separation/differentiation of services in the delivery system; the need for a residential school and where it should be located; the best system for collaborating and networking of resources; and the overall administration of services including the structure for how to network. Ms. Schaefer indicated she had received consistent and daily comments from participants thanking the Board for allowing them this opportunity to be involved in the discussion and for being allowed to be heard. She noted that the representation on the advisory board(s) will include the voices of those who will be impacted and that they will be equally weighted in terms of importance. 1. Approval of the University of Idaho's Law School Implementation Plan for the Two-Location Concept and Legislative Appropriation in FY 2010 Budget Request Steven Daley Laursen, Interim President of the University of Idaho introduced the panel of presenters. He discussed the proposal for a two-location concept noting that the proposal fits with the University's role as a land-grant institution. Mr. Laursen assured the Board that the law school's primary location will always be in Moscow. He suggested that this is a time of urgency in terms of making a decision. He indicated that the University's Foundation enthusiastically endorsed the proposal. Dean Don Burnett addressed the Board. He provided details as he reviewed information provided in the Board materials. He suggested that if the two-location concept is approved, the University's law school will be stronger academically, able to serve a bigger population, and will add value to the existing programs. He discussed a detailed year-to-year operating and capital budget which goes through FY 2017. He noted that there would be phased-growth with additional operating costs supported by appropriations, fees, private giving, and grants. To counter claims that the intent is to permanently move the law school to Boise, Dean Burnett pointed out that the Attorney General's ruling makes it clear that the law school cannot move out of Moscow. Chief Justice Schroeder spoke on behalf of Chief Justice Eismann. He read a letter from Chief Justice Eismann. Chief Justice Schroeder noted that this cooperative effort of the Supreme Court and the law school was presented to the Legislature in 2007 so it could receive extensive public comment and scrutiny. One driver of this effort is that the role of law is critical in our society. He emphasized that this effort will benefit the Courts, the students, and the public at large. Senator Denton Darrington addressed the Board. He suggested that Idaho cannot remain static; it needs to be progressive or it will regress. He clarified that this proposal has come as a result of many years of discussion. Initially, it started with discussions about what to do with the Law Library. He noted that a recommendation went before the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee last year to fund a study regarding the need for a Law Center. Senator Darrington indicated that he hadn't heard of any attempt by anyone involved with the proposal to move the entire law school from Moscow to Boise. Rather, it's been emphasized that the desire is simply to move some functions to Boise because it is the center of population growth. He suggested that controls can be put into place to make sure the school does stays in Moscow. Senator Darrington asked the Board members to be progressive in their thinking related to the law school coming to Boise. BOARDWORK 13 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 Justice Linda Copple-Trout spoke on behalf of the Law Advisory Council. She addressed the concern that the branch in Boise is just a prelude to moving the entire operation to Boise. She assured the Board, on behalf of the Advisory Council, which has a large number of UI alums on it, that is definitely not the case. In terms of there being enough lawyers in Boise, she observed that people with a law degree also pursue a number of different careers in a number of different areas outside of law, so it isn't just the number of lawyers that should be considered. Richard Morgan a consultant who has worked on the development of this plan indicated he favored the dual location approach. It keeps a substantial presence in the Boise area while maintaining a significant role in Moscow. He noted that the budgets presented with this plan are reasonable. It will take additional funds from the Legislature as well. He suggested that a dual location approach will allow for increased enrollments. He said he was optimistic that this will be a successful enterprise because there is a need in Idaho, and in Boise. Also, the University, the faculty, and the Law Center are committed to this effort. Brian Williams a recent graduate from the University of Idaho, College of Law addressed the Board. He said the prospect of a dual location means that there will be greater opportunity for students in Moscow and elsewhere in Idaho. He discussed how this would benefit place-bound students and their families, and indicated he was very confident this would be a good move. State Superintendent Luna asked about a tuition fee comparison between having a private sector entity fill the void versus the UI filling the void. Dean Burnett indicated that tuition at the University is $11,000 (out of state is $21,000) while the tuition for other northwest private schools ranges upwards from $29,000. Board member Agidius passed along concerns that have been expressed to him. One is that the specialty areas that would stay in Moscow are not areas of growth; the areas of growth are those being shifted to Boise. He applauded the collaborative effort between the law school and the law library, but suggested that the need for a presence in Boise is not as great as is being proposed. He expressed concerns about funding the operation as well. Dean Burnett indicated that the basic J.D. curriculum would be offered at both locations and that moving the specialty areas will enhance what the University is already doing. He indicated that the upper level specialties tend to be seminar size programs which could be shared between the two campuses via distance learning. President Laursen addressed the concerns about the areas that are suggested to stay in Moscow and pointed out that there is data to support that each one is viable, has high visibility, and expects greater growth in terms of need for legal services and representation. Board member Hall suggested that while there is a health care crisis in the U.S., there isn't a growing demand for attorneys. Dean Burnett pointed out again that Boise is the only state capitol in the United States without a law school. He reiterated that the concept is also to have phased-growth. Board member Hall raised a question about the sm all numbers of applicants who actually come to the University of Idaho, College of Law. Dean Burnett indicated that there are several factors, but a primary one is that Idaho doesn't have a law school in the largest population area of the state. He reiterated that because this is view ed as a drawback by many applicants, they often choose to go elsewhere in the end. BOARDWORK 14 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 Board member Hall expressed a concern that the quality of education may suffer if limited resources are divided between two locations. Dean Burnett suggested that the investment of funds to improve the program doesn't detract from the idea that improvement includes strategically advancing the program by an enhanced presence in Boise. . Board member Lewis noted that Board policy requires that, before programs are increased or approved, the Board fully understands the implicat ions in terms of economics and policy. He observed that while many programs would be enhanced by being in Boise that has not been the direction those programs, institutions, or this Board have taken lightly. Mr. Lewis suggested that the statistics presented in the materials provide argument not for growth or expansion, but for moving the law school to Boise altogether. M/S (Thilo/Terrell): To approve the request by the UI for (1) authorization to proceed with its Implementation Plan for two locations of the UI College of Law as described in the Implementation Plan presented to the Regents, and (2) authorization to include a legislative appropriation in the FY 2010 budget to prepare the program for the initial incoming class as provided in the Plan. Information on the progress of the implementation plan will be brought routinely to the Regents for updates, and any further approvals required by Board policy will be brought to the Regents in a timely manner. Board member Westerberg said that he found some merit in the proposal, but would like to see market information that demonstrates there are jobs in Idaho. He wondered if applicants would be considered separately for each separate location. Dean Burnett indicated that applicants would be asked about career paths, but ultimately the University will determine which location should accept the student, based on faculty workload and saturation. Board member Lewis referred to page 23 of the study provided by the University of Idaho and indicated the chart on that page demonstrates his concern that as a percentage, University of Idaho graduates have a harder time of finding jobs compared to those from other states because many University of Idaho graduates end up in public sector positions. Dean Burnett explained that UI students do tend to start out in public sector jobs not because of the quality of the student or the school, but because of the limitations that deprive students in Moscow from the relevant partnerships and networking opportunities that would be available to them if the law school expands to Boise. Substitute Motion (Thilo/Terrell): To authorize the UI to expand its offerings in Boise to a full third year curriculum and to include a legislative appropriation in the FY 2010 budget for this expansion. The Regents recognize the statewide mission of the UI for legal education and approve the concept of a full three-year branch curriculum in Boise. The UI is instructed to re-visit the funding model for the full three year branch curriculum, to continue collaboration with the Idaho Supreme Court on the Idaho Law Learning Center, and return to the Regents for further discussion. Board member Thilo clarified her intent with the motion. She noted she hears support for the intent for a law school in Boise. The third year concept allows UI to have access to all the metropolitan opportunities and is a way for the UI to get a foot in the door. Board member Hall amended Ms. Thilo's substitute motion. He agreed that some presence in Boise is important and hoped that the UI is interested in having a third year presence in Boise. AMENDED Substitute Motion (Hall/Terrell): To authorize the UI to expand its offerings in Boise to a full third year curriculum and to include a legislative appropriation in the FY BOARDWORK 15 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 2010 budget for this expansion. The Regents recognize the statewide mission of the UI for legal education. The UI is instructed to re-visit the funding model for a branch curriculum in Boise, to continue collaboration with the Idaho Supreme Court on the Idaho Law Learning Center, and return to the Regents for further discussion. Second Substitute Motion: (Lewis/Thilo): To authorize the UI to expand its offerings in Boise to a full third year curriculum and to include a legislative appropriation in the FY 2010 budget for this expansion. The Regents recognize the statewide mission of the UI for legal education. The UI is instructed to re-visit the issue of funding and support for a full dual location model, including a full three (3) year branch curriculum in Boise, to continue collaboration with the Idaho Supreme Court on the Idaho Law Learning Center with respect to those programs to be delivered in Boise, and to return to the Regents for further discussion. Motion carried 6-2 (Agidius and Hall voted Nay). Board member Lewis clarified his intent in the motion is to have an experience with a third year program to see how it works before considering going with something more. It allows for a continuation of the discussion. 2. This item was pulled from the agenda. 3. Approval of the Eight-Year Plan - Two-Year Update M/S (Thilo/Luna): To approve the updated Eight-Year Plan for academic years 2008-09 to 2015-16. Motion carried 7-0 (Lewis absent during vote). 4.

Motion carried 7-0 (Lewis absent during vote). 6. Statewide Assessment Committee Recommendation/Report Information item. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES - SECTION 1 1. University of Idaho - Employment Contract - Head Women's Soccer Coach M/S (Westerberg/Agidius): To approve the University of Idaho's employment contract with head women's soccer coach Peter Showler. Motion carried 7-0 (Lewis absent during vote). BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES - SECTION 2 1. FY 2019 Budget Requests a. Budget Requests BOARDWORK 16 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 M/S (Westerberg/Thilo): To approve the Line Items for the agencies and institutions as listed in Attachment 1, to forward to the Division of Financial Management and Legislative Services Office the remaining Line Items as listed in Attachment 2, and to authorize the Executive Director to approve the MCO and Line Item budget requests, pending adjustments for increases in the Health Insurance Premium, for agencies and institutions due to DFM and LSO on September 1, 2008. Motion carried 7-1 (Edmunds voted Nay). Board member Westerberg presented this item and explained the process for prioritizing the line items. Board member Hall raised a question about the line item related to the University of Idaho law school. He indicated he was uncomfortable in approving that particular line item until UI could adjust the costs, based on the fact that the scope of that effort was downsized from the original proposal. He asked that the Board instruct the Executive Director to review the number and to amend the number in the list of line items. Lloyd Mues of the University of Idaho spoke up and reported that the he had already been in touch with the budget officer at UI to adjust that number. He will get the revised number back to the Board. Board member Edmunds indicated that he was not familiar enough with the process for reviewing and considering the line items to vote for them. By unanimous consent the Board agreed to this. b. Capital Budget Requests M/S (Westerberg/Thilo): To approve the Capital Projects list for FY 2010. Motion carried 7- 1 (Edmunds voted nay). 2. Optional Retirement Plan - Proposed Amendments M/S (Westerberg/Hall): To adopt Amendment 3 to the Idaho Optional Retirement Plan. The proposed amendment is attached. Motion carried unanimously. 3. 403(b) Plan - Proposed Amendments M/S (Westerberg/Edmunds): To adopt the Idaho Tax Deferred 403(b) Plan as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. 4. Amendment to Board Policy - Section V.K., Construction Projects - First Reading M/S (Edmunds/Westerberg): To approve the first reading of the amendment to Board Policy V.I. - Real and Personal Property Services and Policy V.K. Construction Projects. Motion failed 5 - 3 (Terrell, Edmunds and Westerberg voted in favor of the motion). Board member Agidius raised a concern that this amendment would increase the amount that can be approved without Board review. Scott Christie of the Board office explained it was an aggregate amount, not an incremental amount. Board member Agidius said he was still not comfortable with the idea of the Board not being able to review amounts under $1,000,000 because a project could come in at $999,999 and the Board wouldn't see it. Board member Hall indicated he would vote against it for the same reason and that it hasn't been cumbersome for him to review items. Board member Westerberg suggested that work needs to take place on clarifying the intent. Another motion will come back before the Board at another time. BOARDWORK 17 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 5. Amendment to Board Policy - Section V.W., Litigation - First Reading M/S (Westerberg/Edmunds): To approve the first reading of Board Policy V.W. - Litigation. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Hall asked for clarification on the motion. Board member Edmunds asked about the amounts indicated. Jeff Schrader, the Board's legal counsel, indicated the ultimate dollar thresholds are solely the discretion of the Board. 6. Boise State University - Corporate Spons orship Agreement - St. Lukes/Elks Rehab Services M/S (Westerberg/Thilo): To approve Boise State University's request to enter into a corporate sponsorship agreement with St. Luke's-Idaho Elks Rehabilitation Services in accordance with the terms in the attached final draft of the agreement.

M/S (Westerberg/Edmunds): To delegate authority to the Executive Director of the Board to approve a beverage services agreement between Boise State University and Swire Pacific Holdings, Inc. and Coca-Cola North America upon review of a final agreement, consistent with the terms herein. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Edmunds indicated that Swire wa s a client of his approximately twenty years ago. Given the time frame, the Board agreed there is not a conflict of interest on his part. Stacy Pearson of Boise State University reported that there had been no other bids for this sponsorship. 8. Boise State University - Banking Services Agreement - Wells Fargo Bank M/S (Westerberg/Hall): To delegate authority to the Executive Director of the Board to approve a banking services agreement between Boise State University and Wells Fargo upon review of a final agreement, consistent with the terms herein.

University of Idaho - Nancy Cummings Center Project M/S (Westerberg/Agidius): To approve the request by the University of Idaho to increase the Capital Project Authorization for the Residential Facility, UI Nancy M. Cummings Research, Education & Extension Center, Salmon, Idaho from $1,500,000 to $2,213,410 to allow for the full implementation of the construction phase. M/S (Hall/Luna): To postpone this item until the next meeting. Motion carried unanimously. Lloyd Mues explained that when this project was approved in 2006, construction costs were lower. The qualified bidders came in higher than what was anticipated. Board President Terrell BOARDWORK 18 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 indicated he was very disturbed by the numbers and would vote against this proposal. Board member Agidius agreed with Board member Terrell about the numbers and suggested that the architect was wrong in his original projections. Mr. Terrell said he would like to see the justification for the amounts. Board member Hall said he would like to see a justification from the institution that the additional costs are worth it to the institution. He raised a concern as to where the additional money will come from. 10. University of Idaho - Interdisciplinary Studio Complex - Art and Architectures Project M/S (Westerberg/Agidius): To authorize the University of Idaho to proceed with project planning and design for an interdisciplinary studio complex, at a cost not to exceed $400,000, to be funded with private in-kind donations and gift funds. Motion carried unanimously. Lloyd Mues of the University of Idaho presented th is item. Board President Terrell clarified that this is tied to $3.5 million of other funding. 11.

Motion carried unanimously. Jim Fletcher from ISU presented this item. He discussed the parameters of the proposal and indicated that it would be financially prudent for ISU to take this step. He provided clarification on the suggested housing allowance and noted that ISU currently owns both properties. With the sale of the Magnuson property, ISU will realize a financial benefit. M/S (Westerberg/Hall): To approve the move of the Alumni Association from the Magnuson House to the Servel House. Motion carried unanimously. M/S (Westerberg/Hall): To approve the sale of the Magnuson Alumni House at an amount greater than or equal to the appraised value. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Thilo asked if there would be any negative response from the community regarding the sale of the Magnuson House. Mr. Fletcher explained that the facility was purchased by ISU in 1976 and that there hasn't been any negative reaction from the community. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 1. Superintendent's Update State Superintendent Luna noted that members from the U.S. Department of Education announced that Idaho is one of five states to receive a multi-million charter school grant. Idaho's efforts to expand opportunities for at-risk students will be helped by these monies. 2. School District Property Transfer - Lakeland-West Bonner (Nunnallee Petition) M/S (Luna/Agidius): To accept the findings and conclusions issued by the hearing officer and to approve the recommendation of the hearing officer to excise and annex property from West Bonner School District to Lakeland School District as proposed in the petition submitted by Chris Nunnallee. Motion carried unanimously. State Superintendent Luna noted that neither district opposes this request. He introduced Chris Nunnallee, the petitioner. She explained her request is a result of the property transfer petition submitted by Tonya Reed to the Board, and approv ed by the Board at the April 2008 meeting. Her children are in the same situation as Ms. Reed's children so she would like to have her property be included in the first petition. All of her children already attend the Lakeland School District. Mr. Luna noted that the State Department of Education appointed a hearing officer to review the request and the hearing officer strongly approved this request. 3. School District Property Transfer - Kuna-Meridian M/S (Luna/Edmunds): To accept the findings and conclusions in the recommended order BOARDWORK 20 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 issued by the hearing officer and to deny the petition for the excision and annexation of property from Kuna Joint School District to Meridian Joint School District. Motion carried 6-2 (Lewis and Luna voted Nay). Mike Rothwell the petitioner was introduced by State Superintendent Luna. Mr. Rothwell explained that the Meridian school district gave him wrong information related to which district this property was in prior to the time he purchased the home. He purchased the home believing it was in the Meridian School District. Afterwards he was told that was not the case. Mr. Rothwell indicated that while his children have been allowed by the Meridian School District to attend Meridian schools, the district won't provide transportation for them even though the school bus goes past his house. It has been a great hardship for both him and his wife to transport three children to and from three different schools. He also indicated that the Meridian schools are closer to his home than the Kuna schools. Mr. Rothwell pointed out that one of the conditions in the rules that allows for transferring property from one district to the other has to do with what is best for the children. He emphasized that condition needed to be applied to this situation and urged the Board to approve his petition. He indicated he understood that if the Board did approve the petition the voters would make the final decision. Mr. Luna shared that the Meridian District supports the property transfer while the Kuna district denied support. In addition, the hearing officer recommended denying the petition. Mr. Luna indicated to Mr. Rothwell that he would like to meet with him and the Meridian District to see if the issue of transportation could be worked out. 4. Pending Rules - 08-0202-0801 - Certification Definitions M/S (Luna/Agidius): To approve Pending Rules - Docket No. 08-0202-0801 - Certification Definitions. Motion carried unanimously. 5. Pending Rules - 08-0202-0802 - Amendment to Professional Growth M/S (Luna/Hall): To approve the Pending Rule Docket 08-0202-0802 - Application Procedures / Professional Development.

Pending Rules - 08-0203-0802 - Idaho Mathematics Course Standards for Secondary Mathematics M/S (Luna/Agidius): To approve the revisions to the Idaho Mathematics Course Standards for Secondary Mathematics courses to be incorporated by reference into rule. Motion carried unanimously. M/S (Luna/Hall): To approve pending rule Docket 08-0203-0802 - Idaho Mathematics Course Standards for Secondary Mathematics, Extended Content Standards and Cut Scores for Science Alternate Assessment. Motion carried unanimously. 7. Temporary Rule - 08.02.03.004, Idaho Content Standards - Chemistry M/S (Luna/Agidius): To approve the Idaho Content Standards for Chemistry to be Incorporated by reference into rule.

Motion carried unanimously. M/S (Luna/Agidius): To approve the temporary rule change to IDAPA 08.02.03.004, Rules Governing Thoroughness, to incorporate by reference the Idaho Content Standards for Humanities. Motion carried unanimously. 9. Statewide Longitudinal Data System Grant M/S (Luna/Agidius): To approve the Office of the Board of Education and Department of Education to collaboratively develop the application for the Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems Grant, and authorize the Executive Director to submit, once fully reviewed by Board staff and legal counsel and approved by the Division of Financial Management. Motion carried unanimously. State Superintendent Luna noted this is not a matching grant. Idaho is in a favorable situation because last year the Department received two m illion dollars as the first installment of long- term funding for this effort. Board member Lewis asked where Idaho is headed in terms of a data system. Mr. Luna noted a thorough proposal was provided to the Legislature last year and he will forward that information to the Board. The proposal outlines the flow of money over the next three years and the development of a data system. Mr. Lewis indica ted that not knowing the total costs is risky. Mr. Luna explained that the Department clearly knows what this will look like. The total projected cost is $11 million, with over four y ears to implement it. Then it will cost $1.9million every year after to maintain it. 10. 2007-2008 Final Accreditation Summary Report of Idaho Schools M/S (Luna/Edmunds): To approve the 2007-2008 Accreditation Final Summary Report of Idaho Schools as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. Board member Hall asked if there are any schools in the latter categories. State Superintendent Luna indicated he doesn't have that information at hand, but it is in the report. He will forward it to Mr. Hall. 11. Professional Standards Commission Appointment M/S (Luna/Thilo): To approve Cathy Bierne as a member of the Professional Standards Committee for a term of three years representing secondary classroom teachers. Motion carried unanimously. 12. Curricular Materials Adoption BOARDWORK 22 Boardwork October 9-10, 2008 M/S (Luna/Hall): To approve the request by the State Department of Education for adoption of curricular materials and their related instructional materials as recommended by the Curricular Materials Selection Committee as submitted. Motion carried unanimously. State Superintendent clarified that the Department of Education has a set cycle for reviewing curricular materials and that there is a window of opportunity for vendors to come back. The vendors are all aware of the timelines. OLD BUSINESS Board member Terrell explained that the Executive Committee still has on its agenda to look at the idea of providing incentives for college presidents as part of their contracts. He asked Board member Lewis to take part in that discussion. OTHER BUSINESS M/S (Agidius/Lewis): To adjourn at 6:18. Motion carried unanimously.

Performance Highlights: This past year has been an eventful and successful one for the Idaho Council on Economic Education and its Centers throughout the state. The International Ec onomic Summit program and student financial literacy programs have continued to generate a lot of excitement and support among educators, students and the general public across Idaho. Below are a few highlights: 1. North Idaho. Support for our economic education pr ograms in North Idaho was espe cially strong. With the help of our new Center Co-Director, Dr. Heidi Rogers fr om the University of Idaho, we were able to increase student participation at the International Economic Summi ts from approximately 200 stu dents per event to over 500 students per event. In fact, the largest Economic Summi t events we have ever conducted were this past year in the Coeur d' Alene area. In addition to the great student turn out, we also saw a huge increase in community volunteers in North idaho. 2. Twin Falls Growth. Our newest Center for Economic Education is based at the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls. Under the leadership of Bryan Matsuoka fr om CSI, this Center has been building its reputation and establishing its ability to serve schools for the last few years. This past year, the Center's efforts have really paid off. Attendance at teacher training events as we ll as student events has be en stronger than ever. 3. China - Idaho Connection. Region 3 and the Boise State Center have also had an especially great year. Not only did we continue with our traditional economic and finan cial education programs for teachers and students but we also had an opportunity during the Summer to take 5 st udents and 2 teachers from the Boise School District to China, where they played a direct role in leading 350 Chinese students and their teachers through the International Economic Summit program and teaching them about the Free Enterprise System, of which Idaho and the United States is so proud. This project was supported by the Boise State University Foundation, the Boise School District Foundation, the Idaho Department of Commerce, the families of the Idaho students and several other individuals and organizations. 4. Federal Reserve Bank. The Idaho Council has str engthened and expanded our relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco this past year. Not only has the Fed licensed and adopted our International Economic Summit program as the country's \"best educational program in international economics and globalization\" but it has also implemented this Idaho-g rown program in Washington, California, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii, Arizona and several other states. The Fed continues to be very supportive of the Idaho Council and our Centers. 5. Bottom Line. The bottom line benefit for Idaho throug h the Council on Economic Education is that our youth and their teachers continue to receive the best training available anywhere in economics and personal finance. This is not to say that we are doing enough to prepare our youth for the future. In many ways we are only scratching the surface of the need for economic and financ ial education, but we are making progress and we are pleased that thousands of Idaho students and hundreds of teachers benefit every year from the work and service we are able to provide. 10Special Programs - Idaho Council on Economic Education Agency Profile Part II - Performance Measures Performance Measure FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 Benchmark Number of Community Volunteers Participating in Providing Economic and Financial Education Programs to Idaho Students and Teachers *275 *325 360 350 350 Performance Measure Explanatory Notes: *Numbers from 2005 and 2006 are approximate.

The fewer federal dollars expended per surveyable project, the more clients that a center is serving per federal dollar. The ratio compares TechHelp's federal dollars expende d per surveyable project to the median amount for all federal MEP centers across the country. A ratio bel ow the national median (less than 1.0) indicates that TechHelp is more efficient than most MEP centers. *** Bottom-line Client Impact is a calculation of client sa les and savings divided by federal dollars expended. The higher the impact per federal dollar, the more effective that a center is. The ratio compares TechHelp's bottom-line client impact to the median amount for all federal M EP centers. A ratio above the national median (greater than 1.0) indicates that TechHelp is more effective than most MEP centers.

Both programs are funded from State allocations, grants, local hospitals, Graduate Medical Education, Medica re and patient revenues. The ISU FMR is a division of the Department of Family Medicine in the Kasiska College of Health Professions. The residency is governed by a Graduate Medical Education Commi ttee (GMEC) that oversees all residen cy functions, with members from ISU, Portneuf Medical Center, County Commissioners, loca l physicians and resident physicians. Jonathan Cree, M.D. is the Director of the ISU FM R and Department Chair. S ponsorship by a stable hospital medical center, committed to teaching is essential to ongoing residency success. Core Functions/ Idaho Code 1. Training family physicians to provide care to populations throughout Idaho, both rural and urban. Idaho is 49th out of 50 in physician per capita state statistics in the USA and has a special problem recruiting physicians to settle in isolated rural Idaho. Both residency programs have an excellent track record of recruiting family physicians that settle and stay in I daho, and gives Idaho the honor of being the eighth state in the nation in retention rates. The ISU FMR has 18 m edical residents and two pharmacotherapy residents in training, and graduates six new family physicians each June. Thirty-three of 65 graduates have stayed in Idaho. 2. Provision of services to underserved populations in Idaho: Over the last decade the two residency programs and t heir graduates have become leading medical providers to the underserved populations in Idaho. Reimbursement of such medical services has been declining, while program costs have been climbing. The ISU FMR provides over $1. 8 million in medical services to Medicaid, Medicare, and the indigent. Approximately 40% of th e $2.2 million (or $900,000) annual charges are written off to bad dept and contractual adjustments. The ISU FM R staffs community services such as the Health Department, adolescent detention centers, prison servic es, free clinics and HIV clinics. The Indian Health Service, migrant workers, nursing home residents and the home-bound also receive medical support from the residents.

Approximately 25% of thes e dollars are used for departmental needs that have nothing to do with the residency, leav ing $560,475 for 18 residents or $31,137 per resident as our best estimate of dollar cost per resident. Total departmental budget is $5.12M; $747,300 is 14.6% of that figure. Performance Highlights: Clinical Service Grants : The ISU FMR has active clinical grant writ ers who pursue grants to help offset residency deficits and enrich the clinical traini ng. Over the last decade, these grants have assisted funding outreach to rural perinatal populations in American Falls and Aberdeen, unins ured GYN patients with pre-cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix, education in the New Model Office Paradi gm and Quality Improvements. Total Title VII awards between 1999 and 2005 were $2,827,542. New Title VII Award 2008 - 2011 : ISU FMR received notice of a $900,000 award to promote interventions in exercise, nutrition and lifestyle choices at all phases of the family life cycle. We plan to combine a powerful, multi- disciplinary health resource personnel t eam that will foster the evolution of a new Therapeutic Li festyle Center in our Family Medicine Clinic. These innovations will be facilitated by an enhanced healthcare information technology infrastructure and the development of a Medi cal Home Business Model. This award of $300,000 per year, brings the total clinical grant funding to $3,727,542. Research Division : The ISU FMR sponsors an active and successful research division. We are the recipients of two prestigious NIH multi-center trials, ACCORD and AI MHIGH. The division was a major contributor to the ALLHAT study which changed the approach to hypertensi on treatment all over the world. A staff of highly qualified research assistants and coordi nators service these grants; and the clinical research division is extremely productive in scholarship research publications a nd book chapters. Between February 1995 and February 2008, the ISU FMR Research Division was successful in securing $2,338,629 in grant funding.

There are currently eight (8) seats available for Idaho residents to obtain their dental education. The Program began in 1981 with a cooperative agreement between Idaho State Univ ersity and The University of Washington School of Dentistry, where five (5) Idaho residents received their dental education. In 1982 the program became a cooperative effort between Creighton University's School of Dentistry in Omaha, Nebraska and Idaho State University's Kasiska College of Health Professions in Pocatello, Idaho. The program involves a decentralized first year of education taught at Idaho St ate University and the second through fourth years taught at Creighton University. The program currently has five (5) regular employees and five (5) adjunct employees in Pocatello. Dr. Jeff Ybarguen is the program director and works with Dr. Brian Crawford who is the Chair of the Department of Dental Sciences at ISU. Jeri Larsen is the Administrative Assistant (AA-II) who works with both the IDEP program and the Idaho Advanced Graduate Dentistry (IAGD) residency. These programs are located in the same facility at Idaho State University. Core Functions/Idaho Code The mission of the Idaho Dental Education Program is tw o-fold: First, to provide residents of Idaho with ready access to a high quality dental education; and second, to help the population of Idaho have ready access to high quality dental professionals. As the ma jority of students graduating from the program return to Idaho to practice, residents of the state have access to high quality dental treatment.

Since inception 67% of IDEP graduates have returned to Idaho to practice. The statewide distribution closely follows the state geographic population with 6% of graduates pr acticing in South Central Idaho, eighteen percent 18% in Northern, 31% in Southeastern, and 42% in Southwestern Idaho. Seventy-nine percent of graduates practice general dentistry while 21% practice as specialists. Si xty-five percent practice in Idaho's urban areas with 35% practicing in rural areas. With approximately twelve (12) applicants for each seat, the program has been successful in attracting the highest quality students to the program. The avera ge DAT scores and undergraduate GPA's of our students consistently exceed that of the average marks of matric ulated students in dental sch ools nationally. The average scores on the Dental National Board Examination for both Part I and Part II are consistently higher for IDEP students compared to the Creighton average and nat ional average on the same examinations.

This information is tabulated in the ADA Survey of Dental Education , published by the American Dental Association. Fr om this publication (inflation Adjusted) the national average cost per student for state programs is $115,742 in 2008. The IDEP cost per student for 2008 was $38,260 (33% of the national average). The pr ogram is accomplishing the goal of providing a competitive value in educating Idaho dentists. *** Our goal is to have greater than 50% of our program participants return to Idaho to practice Dentistry. Four of the 8 graduates in 2008 are advancing thei r education through post-graduate residency programs and may return to Idaho to practice upon residency completion. Of the remaining 4 graduates, 2 have returned to Idaho to practice, and 2 are practicing in other states. 30Health Programs - IDEP Dental Educat ion Performance Measurement Report For More Information Contact Dr. Jeff Ybarguen Health Programs, IDEP Dental Education Idaho State University, Campus Box 8088 Pocatello, ID Phone: (208) 282-3289 E-mail: ybarj@isu.edu 31 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 32Special Programs - Idaho Museum of Natural History Performance Measurement Report Part 1 - Agency Profile Agency Overview: Recognizing the importance of our natural heritage to t he citizens of the State, the Idaho Museum of Natural History (IMNH) is charged with preserving and interpreting cu ltural and natural history for the citizens of Idaho. It is the mission of the Idaho Museum of Natural History to actively nurture an understanding of and delight in Idaho's natural and cultural heritage. As the official state museum of natural history, it acquires, preserves, studies, interprets, and displays natural and cultural objects for Idaho residents, visitors, and the world's community of students and scholars. T he Museum also supports and encourages Idaho's other natural history museums through mentoring and training in sound museological practices. The Idaho Museum of Natural History is home to collections in anthropology, vertebrate paleontology, earth science, and the life sciences.

Performance Highlights: Current exhibits featured at the I daho Museum of Natural History include the following. These exhibits are representative of the high quality programming that the Mus eum staff and constituencies are consistently offering the citizens of the State of Idaho. \"The Art of Paleontology\" features the outstanding artwork of world-renowned Pa leoartist Mark Hallett. Stunning bronze casts of saber-tooth cats attacking a Bison latifrons fill the center of the gallery . The exhibit also features elements from IMNH's Tolo Lake Exhibit to teach visitors ab out one of the most significant paleontological sites in Idaho. \"A Century of Fish Hatcheries,\" on loan from the I daho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) where it was created by Mick Hoover and Sharon Clar k, celebrates the 100th anniversary of the legislative act that created the first state fish hatchery. Also featured in the Fish and Game exhibit is historical aquaculture equipment which was designed and built out of necessity at the fish hatcheries. This equipment and historical photographs chronicle the 100-year-old practices and techniques used for spawning and egg collection, egg care until hatching, transportation of fish eggs, fish f eeding and diet development, and the event ual planting of mature fish via horseback, backpack, truck, boat, airplane, and helicopt er with a collection of equipment and historical photographs. \"Dinosaur Times in Idaho\" features dioramas with cast skeletons of dinosaurs that roamed Idaho are enlivened with mural art by noted dinosaur reconstruction artist Robe rt Walters. They highlight these dinosaurs and their surroundings in prehistoric Idaho. Topics include spec ific information on all the dinosaurs discussed and displayed, what Idaho's environment was like during the time s of the dinosaurs, where we're likely to find more of this rare and interesting fauna, and why more hasn't been found to date. \"Raising The Tolo Lake Mammoth\" features the remains of a huge bull Columbian Mammoth found in northern Idaho. Expeditions led by Idaho Museum of Natural History paleontologists during 1994 and 1995 recovered more than 400 bones (now in the Museum's research collections) including most of this mammoth and parts of other animals from Tolo Lake, west of Grangeville, Idaho. RA ISING THE TOLO LAKE MAMMOTH tells the story of this find from discovery to research using actual Tolo Lake Fossils. The center piece is the reconstructed dig with explanations of excavation methods and descriptions of w hat research has revealed about the lake and its fossils. Supporting exhibits explore mammoth anatomy, evolution, and the history of mammoths and their relatives in North America. Focusing on Idaho's Native Peoples, \"Living Off the Land\" features sections on ancient tools and technologies as well as recent objects still used. The exhibit shows ho w they lived on an unforgivi ng landscape, making use of nature's resources for food, clothing, and shelter, and offers never-before exhibited artifacts and beautiful objects made by these creative people.

The University is also responsible for regional medical and veterinary medical education programs in which the state of Idaho participates. The University of Idaho will formulate its academic plan and gener ate programs with primary emphasis on agriculture, natural resources, metallurgy, engineering, architecture, law, foreign languages, teacher preparation and international programs related to the foregoing. The University of Idaho will give continuing emphasis in the areas of business, education, liberal arts and physical, life, and social sciences, which provide the core curriculum or general education portion of the curriculum. The institution serves student s, business and industry, the professional and public sector groups throughout the state and nation as well as diverse and special constituencies. The University also has specific responsibilities in research and extension programs related to its land- grant functions. The University of Idaho works in collaboration with other state postsecondary institutions in serving these constituencies. Core Functions/Idaho Code Recognizing that education was vital to the development of Idaho, the legislature set as a major objective the establishment of an institution that would offer to all the people of the territory, on equal terms, higher education that would excel not only in the arts, letters, and sciences, but also in the agricultural and mechanic arts. The federal government's extensive land grants, particularly under the Morrill Act of 1862, provided substantial assistance in this undertaking. Subsequent federal legislation provided further for the teaching function of the institution and for programs of research and extension. In all, approximately 240,000 acres were allocated to the support of Idaho's land-grant institution. After selecting Moscow as the site for the new university , in part because Moscow was located in the \"center of one of the richest and most populous agricultural sections in the entire Northwest\" and the surrounding area was not subject to the \"vicissitudes of booms, excitement, or speculation,\" the University of Idaho was founded January 30, 1889, by an act of the 15 th and last territorial legislature. That act, commonly known as the university's' charter, became a part of Idaho's organic law by virtue of its confirmation under article IX, section 10, of the state constitution when Idaho was admitted to the union. As the constitution of 1890 provides, \"The location of the University of Idaho, as established by existing laws, is hereby confirmed. All the rights, immunities, franchises, and endowments heretofore granted thereto by the territory of Idaho are hereby perpetuated unto the said university. The regents shall have the general supervi sion of the university and the control and direction of all the funds of, and appropriations to, the university, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law.\" Under these provisions, the University of Idaho wa s given status as a constitutional entity.

Pitkin Forest Nursery: The University of Idaho Pitkin Forest Nursery, administered through the College of Natural Resources with guidance from stakeholders, emphasizes the tripar tite components of a land grant university: teaching, research, and service. The nursery program has served the conservation needs of Idahoans since 1909. The mission of this program, achieved thro ugh our staff, students, coll aborators, and facilities, focuses on native plant regeneration. We teach students and professionals, conduct relevant re search, and serve the native plant industry and Idahoans by sharing information and producing high-quality nursery stock. The University of Idaho Pitkin Forest Nursery interacted with approximately 1500 private landowners in 2007-08 through seedling orders and advice pertaining to seedling establishment. As well, two major industry-based research projects, with numerous field sites in the region, are ongoing. Approximately 10 additional new research projects were initiated. The nursery was an ac tive participant in five courses offered through the Department of Forest Resources and provided servic e programs to approximately 10 Moscow area non-profit groups. Approximately 10 new research projects were initiated in 2007-08. The re sults of three of these projects have been presented at regional science and professional association meetings , while the others are ongoing and should be completed in the current fiscal year. It is expected that this rate of research project initiation, maintenance, and completion should continue for the foreseeable future.

The agency has serv ed the state since 1919 and prior to 1984 was named the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology. The agency is staffed by 10.35 state-funded FTEs and 20-25 externally funded temporary and part-time employees. Members of the Idaho Geological Survey staff acqu ire geologic information through field and laboratory investigations and through cooperative programs wi th other governmental and private agencies. The Idaho Geological Survey's geologic mapping program is the primary applied research function of the agency. The Survey's Digital Mapping Laboratory is central to compili ng, producing, and delivering new digital geologic maps. Other main Idaho Geological Survey programs include geol ogic hazards, hydrology, mini ng, mine safety training, abandoned and inactive mines inventory, and earth science education outreach. As Idaho grows, demand is increasing for geologic inform ation related to population growth, mineral- and water- resource development, landslide hazards and earthquake monitoring. However, delivery of the information and data to the public is restricted by low funding levels for operating expenses and support personnel, which are essential for publishing and Internet delivery. To best serve Idaho, the Idaho Geologi cal Survey needs a Mission Capability Enhancement for additional applied research, info rmation access and services de livery at its offices in Moscow, Boise, and Pocatello. Core Functions/Idaho Code Idaho Code Title 47, Chapter 2, defines the authority, administration, advisory board members, functions and duty of the Idaho Geological Survey.

The WOI Program was established in 1974 as a cooperative program of University of Idaho, Washi ngton State University (WSU), and Ore gon State University (OSU). Oregon recently dropped out of the cooperative program. The Do ctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree is awarded to Idaho students by Washington State University. The WO I Program annually provides 44 Idaho residents with access to a veterinary medical education through a coo perative agreement between the University of Idaho and Washington State University. Idaho provides the cooperative program with the majority of veterinary students who have expressed an interest in production agriculture animals. Core Functions/Idaho Code The University of Idaho provides educational opportunities for any senior student in the Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine by providing the equivalent of 65, one-month teaching rotations in food animal production and clinical medicine at the Caine Vete rinary Teaching Center (CVTC) in Caldwell. Faculty members at the CVTC also interact with Idaho veteri narians and livestock producers providing education and recommendations concerning animal production, diagnosis and clinical evaluation of disease situations. 1. Provide access to veterinary medical education at WSU for Idaho residents - the current WOI contract reserves 11 seats for Idaho veterinary medicine st udents each year. A total of 44 Idaho students are enrolled in this program per year. 2. Assist Idaho in meeting its needs for veterina rians - provide Idaho-trained, Idaho-resident graduate veterinarians to meet annual employment demands fo r the State. On averag e, 65-75% of new Idaho resident graduates of the WOI Program are licensed to practice veterinary medicine in Idaho annually. 3. Provide hands-on instruction opportunities for senior veterinary students - the equivalent of 65, one- month teaching rotations in food animal production medicine and clinical experience are offered annually at the CVTC in Caldwell. 4. Provide access to referrals from Idaho veterinarian s in the areas of food animal production, diagnosis, and clinical evaluation of diseases - a) accept approximately 600 hospital clinical referrals annually as student teaching cases; b) provide disease diagnostic testing on approximately 15,000 diagnostic samples annually, and; c) conduct on-farm disease in vestigations for herd problems as requested by Idaho veterinarians and livestock producers.

Nearly 50% of the Johne's samples tested were milk and serum from sheep and goats. Prior to 2007, Johne's disease had been identified in only 1 sheep flock and 1 goat herd. Since January 2007, we've identified 1 additional goat herd and 6 more sheep flocks positive for Johne's disease. o During FY2007, analyzed 70 samples (three times the usual number of samples), from cattle, sheep & goats for each of four Clostridium species. Clostridium causes sudden death in many species of animals. In nearly all these cases, death was due to Clostridium species not included in the animals' vaccination. Caine Center veterinarians and scientists provided diagnostics and management recommendations for the following new disease situations: o Tritrichomonas fetus diagnosed in a 2,500-cow dairy herd. o Johne's disease diagnosed from milk and serum samples from seven sheep flocks and two goat herds.

Idah o WWAMI provides twenty Idaho students with the opportunity to complete their first year of medical training through the Universi ty of Washington School of Medicine's regional program at the University of Idaho's (UI) Moscow campus, shari ng resources and faculty with the joint program at Washington State University in Pullman. After completing thei r second year of training at the medical school in Seattle, WWAMI students also have the opportunity to return and complete their 3rd and 4th year clinical training requirements in Idaho. These clinical rotations are co ordinated through the WWAMI (Idaho) Office for Clinical Medical Education in Boise. The UI WWAMI Program is directed by Andrew Turner, Ph D, who reports to the Provost at UI, and also functions as an Assistant Dean of the Univer sity of Washington School of Medicine. The WWAMI Clinical Education Program in Boise is directed by Suza nne Allen, MD, MPH, who reports to the Vice Dean for Regional Affairs at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and functions as an Assi stant Dean in Idaho. The UI WWAMI Program employs twelve part-time faculty (shared with other academic programs) and two administrative staff. Idaho students admitted to the WWAMI Medical Program are interviewed and selected by the Idaho Admissions Committee, a group of four Idaho physicians appointed by the Idaho State Board of Education, who work in cooperation with the University of Washington School of Medicine Admissions Committee. The WWAMI Medical Program is committed to helping prepare physicians for medical practice in Idaho, regardless of eventual sub-specialty selection, and to increasing the number of physicians who choose to practice in rural or underserved areas. There is also a stro ng commitment to the partnership between excellence in research and teaching in medical education. On averag e, WWAMI faculty in Idaho bring in $11 Million each year in biomedical research awards. Cutting-edge resear ch prepares the next generation of doctors to be well informed and at the forefront of clinical medical practi ce. The WWAMI faculty at the University of Idaho and our clinical/research faculty in Boise, Pocatello, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Falls, McCall, Sandpoint, Hailey, and rural training communities, are committed to being both dynam ic teachers and informed biomedical scholars. In addition, our WWAMI program goals include the c ontinue d de velopment of the humanitarian and service interests of the medical students, and an enhanced ability to recruit from groups within Idaho that are traditionally underrepresented in medical school populations. To do this, WWAMI delivers outreach programs to high schools and community colleges to help encourage and prepare tale nted Idaho students from rura l, underprivileged, or minority backgrounds who have an interest in medicine and health careers. In June 2008, Idaho WWAMI hosted the third Idaho Pre-Med Summit, in Pocatello. Six egion al coll ege advi sors and fifty-six pre-health and pre- medical students from across Idaho attended this advising and recruitment forum. Core Functions/Idaho Code The core function of the WWAMI Medical Education Program at the University of Idaho is to provide qualified Idaho residents with access and education in the first year of medical training as part of the Idaho State Board of Education's contract with the University of Washington Scho ol of Medicine. Idaho Code \u00a733-3720 authorizes the State Board of Education to enter into contractual agreements to provide access for Idaho residents to qualified professional studies programs, and specifically, the WWAMI medical education program (33-3717B(7)).

Today, LCSC is one of Idaho's four, public 4-year higher education institutions. LCSC's Carnegie classification is Baccalaureate College\u2014Diverse, with the \"diverse\" designation referring to the College's broad mix of undergraduate pr ograms in the professions, arts, and sciences. The Carnegie classification of LCSC's size and setting is \"small four-year, primarily non-residential.\" LCSC's credit and non-credit programs fall within three pr imary mission areas: academic programs, professional- technical programs, and community programs. In addition to its traditional 4-year baccalaureate programs, the College has been assigned a collateral mission of providi ng community college programs within its five-county area of operations (Clearwater, Idaho, Latah, Lewis, and Nez Perce Counties) by its governing body, the State Board of Education. The College emphasizes undergraduat e teaching and learning (w ith research playing a supporting role to teaching), application of learning, di rect interaction among students and faculty (LCSC does not utilize teaching assistants), and a small-college/small-class environment that maximizes the opportunities for the success of LCSC's traditional and non-traditional students. LCSC's main campus is located in Lewiston, ID. The Co llege also delivers instructional programs at the LCSC Coeur d'Alene Center (in collaboration with its Northern Idaho Center for Higher Education [NICHE] partners: North Idaho College, the University of Idaho, and Idaho State University), and operat es outreach centers in Clearwater Valley, Grangeville, and Orofino. LCSC's chief executive officer, President Dene K. Thomas, assumed her duties as the College's 14th president in July 2001. Since that time, LCSC has been the fastest- growing four-year public college/university in Idaho, with a 34% growth in enrollment since FY2001. LCSC is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Core Functions/Idaho Code The statutory basis for LCSC is located in the Idaho Code, Title 33 (Education), Chapter 31, which directs the College to offer instruction in \"four year college courses in science, arts, literature, and such courses or programs as are usually included in liberal arts colleges...\", and further specifies that the board of trustees \"may also establish educational, professional-technical and other courses or programs of less than four years, as it may deem necessary, and such courses or programs that may be given or conducted on or off campus, or in night school, summer schools, or by extension courses.\" LCSC's current role and mission, assigned by the St ate Board of Education, directs that the College \"will formulate its academic plan and generate programs with primary emphasis in the areas of business, criminal justice, nursing, social work, teacher preparation, a nd professional-techni cal education. The College will give continuing emphasis to select programs offered on and o ff campus at non-traditional times, using non-traditional means of delivery and serving a diverse student body. Lewis-Clark State College will maintain basic strengths in the liberal arts and sciences, which provide the core curri culum or general education portion of the curriculum.\" LCSC's revenue comes from state appropriations; student tuition and fees; federal, stat e, and private grants and contracts; sales and services from educational an d auxiliary services; and endowments and gifts. These revenues are allocated to instructional programs and support functions. 57LEWIS-CLARK STATE COLLEGE Performance Measurement Report Revenue and Expenditures 1 Revenue FY 2005 FY 2006 FY Revenues and Expenditures for FY2008 are estimates that have not been confirmed by outside auditors, as of the submission date of this Agency Profile to the State Board of Education Profile of Cases Managed and/ or Key Services Provided Cases Managed and/or Key Services Provided FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 Annual (unduplicated) Enrollment Headcount Awarded - Professional Technical - Undergraduate 579 192 387542 166 376539 159 380 515 141 374 Performance Highlights: Among the events that took place in FY2008 during t he execution of LCSC's Plan were the following: Funding appropriated by the Legislature for $620,6 00 for the nursing facility, and $605,800 for nursing equipment.

Professional-technical education programs are integrated into a larger, educational structure through public school districts, colleges, and universities. The mission of Professional-Technical Education is to provide Idaho's youth and adults with technical skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for performance in a highly effective workplace. Idaho's professional-technical system c onsists of three interconnected delivery mechanisms which operate as a single System: the System office; six postsecondary technical colleges; 789 secondary technical programs and related services throughout the state. The education provided by the System in cludes high school programs, postsecondary programs, workforce upgrading and retr aining, customized training for new and expanding industries, and fire service, hazardous ma terials, and emergency services training. The Division of Professional-Technical Education is the administrative agency of the State Board for Professional- Technical Education and provides leadership, advocacy, and technical assistance for professional-technical education in Idaho, from secondary through adult. It is responsible for state, federal, and dedicated funds management. The Division provides the focus for profes sional-technical education within existing schools and institutions by targeting resources, organizing and applying industry input, providing technical assistance to program areas, managing programs, and providing leadership for student organizations. The Division also acted as the administrative agency for the Career Information System (CIS). In addition, the Division gained responsibility for Human Resources training functions (3 FTP), ABE/GED (3 FTP), and Veterans Education and Proprietary Schools (1 FTP + 1.375 group positions). Funding and technical assistance provid ed by the State Division of Professi onal-Technical Education varies with the level of delivery and training involved. These include: 1. Junior High (7-8) - Funding is limited to special gr ants targeted at career awareness and pre-vocational exploration. The Division provides considerable technica l assistance at the junior high level, particularly related to career guidance and exploration. 2. High school (9-12) - Secondary programs are offe red as part of comprehensive high schools or in professional-technical schools. Stat e funding is provided for approved pr ofessional-technical programs to offset the \"added costs\" associated with operating those programs. Funding for the \"regular\" costs is distributed through the public school funding formula. The professional-technical schools receive special added-cost funding of approximately 1/3 more than t he regular public school funds. High schools are also major recipients of federal funds. The Division is the primary source of technical assistance for the secondary programs including curriculum development, program development, program improvement, statewide student organization supervision, and supplemental services to special populations. 3. Postsecondary - The Division, thr ough the state general account, is the primary source of funding for the postsecondary technical college system. The general account pays for the faculty salaries, operating expenses, capital outlay, and local administration. The postsecondary system also receives federal Perkins money distributed through the Division. The Division is responsible for providing staff support to the State Board for Professional-Technical Education on programmatic and fiscal issues that relate to the technical college system. Technical assistance is provided to the colleges particularly in maintaining program standards and cu rriculum development. The technical co lleges have primary responsibility for program operation, development, and evaluation. The agency has 42 FTP employees. Ei ght (8) of these, however, worked for CIS which was administratively housed within the Division. Of the remaining 34 empl oyees, seven (7) are federa lly funded and 27 are funded through the state general account. The Division also includes 502 postsecondary FTP's in its budget. The Division was established to oversee all professional -technical education and training in the state. It began when the State Board of Education wa s designated as the State Board fo r Vocational Education in 1918 and given the charge to hire an administrator. In 1966, the legislature created a system of area vocational schools 61Idaho Division of Professi onal-Technical Education Performance Measurement Report (postsecondary) which were funded by and responsible to the Division. In the 1980's, these schools were converted into technical colleges and the two-year As sociate of Applied Science degree was added. The Displaced Homemaker Act was also passed in the early 1980's to provide transitional services for displaced homemakers. A dedicated account (divor ce fee) was created and responsibility assigned to the agency. In the early 1990's, additional responsibility for Emergency Services Training was given to the agency through the appropriation process. In 1998, the Professional-Technica l School was created, providing for high-end technical education at regional centers. In 1999, the name of the Board and the Division was changed from vocational education to professional-technical education. Core Functions/Idaho Code Statutory authority for the Division of Professional-Technical Education is delineated in Idaho Code, Chapter 22, \u00a7\u00a7 33-2201 through 33-2212 and IDAPA 55. Section 33-1002G allows school districts to establish professional-technical schools and 39-5009 established the displaced hom emaker account for appropriation to the State Board. The role of the Division of Professional-Technical Educ ation (IDAPA 55) is to admini ster professional-technical education in Idaho. Specifically, the Division: Provides statewide leadership and coordinat ion for professional-technical education; Assists local educational agencies in program planning, development, and evaluation; Promotes the availability and accessibility of professional-technical education; Prepares annual and long-range state plans; Prepares an annual budget to present to the State Board and the Legislature; Provides a state finance and accountability syst em for professional-technical education; Evaluates professional-technical education programs; Initiates research, curriculum development, and professional development activities; Collects, analyzes, evaluates, and disseminates data and program information; Administers programs in accordance with state and federal legislation; Coordinates professional-technical education relat ed activities with other agencies, officials, and organizations.

After this funding was in place for a year, results on the ISAT improved statewide across all subject areas. The funding will continue in future years. The State Department of Education, working with the St ate Board of Education, created the Middle School Task Force in May 2007. The Task Force developed formal recommendations for ways in which the state can help school districts improve st udent achievement in the middle grades. The recommendations include a proposed rule to implement a credit system in grades 7 and 8. The Department staff has presented the Middle School Credit system throughout the state and will continue to work with stakeholders as it brings forth the proposal to the State Board of Education in April 2009. The proposa l will then move forward to the Legislature for final approval in January 2010. The new credit system would be implem ented in the 2010-2011 school year. 71Idaho Public Schools Performance Measurement Report The State Department of Education, with funding from the Idaho Legislature, created a Concurrent Credit Task Force in 2008 to evaluate the current access to postsecondary education and recommend opportunities for Idaho high school students to access college-lev el courses at the high school level. The Task Force will present its recommendations to the Idaho Legislature for approval in January 2009. The State Department of Education ha s increased the number of Highly Qu alified Teachers statewide and is implementing a plan to partner with school districts and utilize federal Title II funding to provide professional development opportunities for educators. With the help of school districts and charter schools across the state, Idaho has increased its number of Highly Qualified Teacher s to 93.06% of teachers statewide, up from 70.3% in the 2006-2007 school year. The State Department of Education is continuing to remove unnecessary barriers that have prevented quality teachers from Idaho classrooms. The SDE has proposed th ree new alternate routes to endorsements, which will offer more simple routes for teachers to earn additi onal endorsements. The SDE is also piloting a new recertification process for all certif ied staff statewide that is less cumbersome for educators, yet provides accountability. The State Department of Education partnered with educational stakeholders and prop osed a pay-for-performance plan for teachers during the 2008 Legislative session. Th e plan did not pass by two votes in the Idaho Senate, but gained widespread support in the Legislature and with the Governor and key educational stakeholders. The 2008 Legislature did approve one piec e of the pay-for-performance plan, wh ich provided funding for the State Department of Education to create a Teacher Perform ance Evaluation Task Force to develop minimum standards for a fair, valid, and consistent teacher performance eval uation system in Idaho. The Task Force will present its recommendations to the Idaho Legislature in January 2009. The State Department of Education has developed a unique student identifier and will implement it statewide in the 2008-2009 school year. The SDE is also working to create a unique teacher identifier. The State Department of Education secured funding for FY2009 to begin development of the State Longitudinal Data System. The SDE has already begun to review all K- 12 data collection systems at the state level, which is the first step to developing the State Longitudinal Data System.

Number of Highly Qualified Teachers Teaching in Their Area of Specialty as a Percentage of the Total Teaching Population: State Department of Education does not have data available for FY2005. The data for HQT teachers in Idaho decreased from FY2006 to FY2007 because, prior to 2007, a previous administration at the Idaho State Department of Education wanted an Idaho certificate/endorsement to stand as the only means necessary to meet the Highly Qualified Teacher requirement. However, this was not in compliance with federal law. The problem was fixed in 2007 under a new administration by clearly communicating with the U.S. Department of Education that the Idaho State Department of Ed ucation was committed to meeting all of the federal requirements. The SDE then created a sense of urgency for all teachers to report qualifications by me ans of Praxis scores, participation in an appropriately rigorous alternative ro ute to certification or a HOUSSE rubric . Districts were also notified that this documentation must be centrally located in the event of an audit. Over the past school year, the accurate number of Highly Qualified Teachers, as defined by federal law, has increased significantly. Percentage of K-12 Students Meeting or Exceed ing Idaho Standard Achievement Test (ISAT): The benchmark for 2014 is that students will be 100% pr oficient or advanced. Fo r 2008, Idaho students met the incremental targets for math (70%) and reading (78%), and missed the target for language usage (78%). Science is only assessed in grades 5, 7, and 10; it is not curr ently part of the calculation and has no annual target for proficiency. Number of Schools Receiving Technical Assistance: The State Department of Education offers technical assi stance to every public school, district and charter school in the state of Idaho through a variety of programs as well as through constant e-mail and phone communication. The data presented in this chart repres ents the number of schools that are of fered technical assistance from the State Department of Education because they are in School Improvement status.

Both programs are funded from State allocations, grants, local hospitals, Graduate Medical Education, Medicare and patient revenues. Family Medicine Residency of Idaho (FMRI), was founded in 1975. FMRI is a Federally Qualified Health Center Look- Alike and is governed by a consumer based independent board and is an independent corporate entity and has a Graduate Medical Education Committee that oversees all residency education functions. The Director and CEO of FMRI is Ted Epperly, M.D. and FM RI is affiliated with the University of Wash ington WWAMI Residency Network. Core Functions/Idaho Code There are two core functions of FMRI: 1. Training family physicians to provide care to populations throughout Idaho, to include rural, urban, and suburban. Idaho ranks 49 th out of 50 in physicians per capita and 47th out of 50 for primary care physicians per capita in the USA and has a special problem recruiting physicians to settle in isolated rural Idaho. Ninety five percent of all Idaho counties are Health Prof essional Shortage Areas for primary care. FMRI has an excellent track record of recruiting family physicians that settle and st ay in Idaho. The Residency, including its Caldwell Rural Training Track, is expanding and is growing to 33 residents in training at any one time and will be graudating ten to 11 new family physicians each June. Currently, the residency programs are exceeding their recruitment target of 50% of their graduates staying within Idaho. Of the 221 FMRI graduates, 124 (56%) family physicians have been recruited and settled in Idaho since the beginning of our program. 2. Provision of services to under served populations in Boise. Over the last three decades the residency program has become the leading medical provider to the underserved population of Boise. Reimbursement of such medical services has been declining, while program costs have been climbing. FM RI provides over three million dollars in medical services to Medicaid, Medicare and the indigent and absorbs approximately one million dollars of uncompensated care annually. FMRI supports and staffs community services such as the Health Department, adolescent detention centers, prison services, free clinics and HIV clinics. Reside nts who settle in Idaho communities have an excellent track record of continuing outreach services to Medi care, Medicaid and indigent patients and supporting free clinics in their communities.

This partnership allows Idaho students to receive medical training not currently available in the state of Idaho. The University of Utah School of Medicine is responsible for the predoctoral , graduate, and continuing education of physicians, the graduate and postdoctoral education of biomedical scientists , and the training of certai n other health specialists. In determining the size and types of its educational prog rams, the school is guided primarily by the needs of the State of Utah. The school is also guided by the impe ratives of affirmative action and by the needs of the surrounding states which lack their own medical schools. In addition, the school emphasized high quality programs that address national priorities, such as the need for generalist and academic physicians, rural practitioners, basic biomedical scientis ts, and selected medical subspecialists. Core Functions/Idaho Code Core Functions/Idaho Code Idaho Code \u00a733-3722 authorizes the State Board of Education to enter into contractual agreements to provide access for Idaho resi dents to qualified professional studies programs. Revenue and Expenditures Revenue FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Funds received through the agreement with Idaho are us ed to support medical student education.

Dr. Michael Graham is the Administrator of the Division. IDVR is charged with several major responsibilities: Management of the State/Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Program, State Renal Disease Program, and Extended Employment Services while also serving as a flow through agency for funding related to the State Epilepsy Program. The Public Vocational Rehabilitation program is one of t he oldest and most successful federal/state programs in America. Vocational Rehabilitation serves individuals with severe disabilities that impose significant barriers to gainful employment. The average time needed for a person to complete a rehabilitation plan and become employed is thirty-two (32) months. In FFY 2007, employment of individuals with disabilities resulted in a 300% increase in client weekly earnings and signi ficant decreases in the need for public support. The structure of IDVR includes a Field Services Bureau as well as Managers who deal with Human Resources, Program Development, Planning and Evaluation, Fiscal Operations, and Information Technology. There are also three zone managers, as well as six Regional Managers who supervise Field staff in the following regions: Coeur d'Alene, Lewiston, Boise, Boise Corrections, Boise Mental Health/School Work, Twin Falls, Pocatello, Idaho Falls, and Caldwell. IDVR is comprised of 159 employees, of which 154 are full time positions serving in thirty-eight (38) offices throughout the state. Offices are located in Boise, M ountain Home, Coeur d'Alene, Sandpoint, Lewiston, Orofino, Moscow, Twin Falls, , Fa lls, Salmon, Rexburg, Caldwell, Nampa, Payette, and Eagle. There is one (1) Central Office, nine (9 ) Regional Offices, eleven (1 1) general Sub-Offices, six (6) Mental Health Sub-Offices, twelve (12) School - Work Sub-Offices, and two (2 ) Corrections Sub-Offices. Core Functions/Idaho Code Legal Authority for the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation is Idaho Code, 33-2301 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amend ed, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, and is augment ed by regulations promulgated and set forth at 34 CFR \u00a7 361.1. Services that may be available include evaluation of r ehabilitation potential, vocational guidance and counseling, physical and mental restoration, vocati onal, academic and other training, j ob placement and other services, which can reasonably be expected to benefit the individual in terms of employment. The Division also manages state appropriated funds to a ssist individuals with chronic renal failure to help cover the catastrophic costs of this seriou s, life-threatening disease. The Divisi on coordinates the medical management of this program, and coordinates its payments with the client's ability to pay, private insurance payments, and Medicare and Medicaid payments (Idaho Code, Chapter 23, Vocational Rehabilitation 33-2307 - 33-2308). The Extended Employment Services ( EES) program provides funding to indi viduals with severe disabilities who are determined unable to maintain competitive employment without on-going support. A state financial allotment is provided annually to be allocated by the EES staff to contracted Co mmunity Rehabilitation Programs who subsequently provide the long term support to eligible clients. The Epilepsy Foundation of Idaho is a statewide not-for-profit organization, staffed by volunteers dedicated to the service of individuals in Idaho affected by epilepsy/seizure disorders. The intent is to overcome the associated problems through direct services, increased public and professional awareness, and the control of epilepsy and its consequences. The Joint Financial Appropriati ons Committee has designated IDVR as the flow through agency for funding this entity. 89Vocational Rehabilitati on, Idaho Division of Performance Measurement Report Revenue and Expenditures Revenue FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 General Cases Managed and/ or Key Services Provided Cases Managed and/or Key Services Provided FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 The Number Individuals by Vocational Rehabilitation 13,438 13,191 12,874 12,612 The Number of Individuals Who Receiving VR Services 1,777 1,907 1,996 2120 The Number of Individuals With Chronic Renal Failure Supported Not available 203 207 196 *IDVR is primarily a federally funded program that as sesses performance on a Federal Fiscal Year basis. (October 1-September 30). For this reason, chart data repr esents figures that are different from State Fiscal year data reported. Performance Highlights In FFY2006-07, the IDVR collaborated with the Department of Corrections and BSU to establish a special training project that was conducted at the corr ectional facility. Through collaboration wi th the Department of Labor, it was determined that there was a strong market need for qualified welders in the state of Idaho. As of this date, seventeen (17) individuals have completed the training and fourteen (14) are currently employed. IDVR, through the support of the Idaho legislature, has provided supplementary financial support to Idaho citizens who are financially in need of such a ssistance in order to obtain life saving end-stage renal services. Historically, this program has proven to be highly successful as a result of the careful administration by IDVR of the limited state resources available. In an effort to utilize all resources available for the su ccessful rehabilitation of ID VR clients, the agency has advocated for and received support from t he state Legislature for the position of a Pass Plan Writer. This position is designed to target cli ents who are SSA beneficiaries and desire to bec ome employed. By utilizing the SSA Plan for Achieving Self Support (PASS), the agen cy is able to access additional fi nancial resources for the qualified recipient that can support the desired employment outcome. During FFY2007, IDVR contracted with an employment specia list in order to enhance the VR counselor's capacity to develop meaningful relationships with state and loca l employers. Subsequent to the training each region developed an individual project that included a st rong collaboration among the Community Rehabilitation Programs, the Department of Labor, and employers. The projects are curr ently in their second quarter of performance and on track for targeted employment outcomes. 90Vocational Rehabilitati on, Idaho Division of Performance Measurement Report Part II - Performance Measures Performance Measure 2005 2006 2007 2008 Benchmark Number of Individuals Exiting the VR Program Who Achieved an Employment Outcome 1777 1907 1996 2120 Meet or exceed previous year Percentage of Individuals Who Exit the VR Program After Receiving Services Who Are Determined to Have Achieved an Employment Outcome 58.58% 54.49% 59.0% 65.5% 55.8% Average Hourly Earnings of Individuals Exiting the VR Program Who Achieved an Employment Outcome During the Current Year $8.77 $8.69 $9.22 $9.81 Meet or exceed previous year Number of Individuals Involved With the Correctional System Exiting the VR Program Who Achieved an Employment Outcome 341 316 337 419 Meet or exceed previous year Percentage of Community Supported Employment clients served through the Extended Employment Services program 51% 51% 52% 53% Meet or exceed previous year Performance Measure Explanatory Notes: The benchmark of 55.8% for individuals who exit the VR program after receiving services who are determined to have achieved an employment outcome is a minimum requirement of the agen cy set by the Federal Rehabilitation Services Administration.

It is governed by the Board of Library Commissioners, whose five memb ers are appointed by the State Board of Education. The agency's name has varied over the years, but through much of its history it was known as the Idaho State Library. Effective July 1, 2006 the name changed to the Idaho Commission for Libraries. The State Librarian, appointed by t he Board of Library Commissioners (I.C. 33-2504), serves as the agency's chief executive officer and is charged with implementing the Board's policies and rules and with managing the operations of the agency. Current State Librarian Ann Jos lin works with three (3) staff as a Management Team: two Associate State Librarians and one Progr am Supervisor. In our relatively flat organization, all employees work to support the agency mission to assist libraries to build the capacity to better serve their clientele. The agency has 45.5 FTE positions in three (3) office locati ons. The central office is in Boise at 325 W. State Street. Field offices are located in Moscow and Idaho Falls. ICFL has its origins in the Columbian Club of Boise, wh ich established the Traveling Library System in 1899. In 1901, the Idaho Free Library Commission was organized as a state institution and received its first appropriation. In addition to providing reading materials to Idaho citizens via the traveling library, t he agency was to assist in the establishment and improvement of free public and school libraries throughout the state, and to deliver, foster, and promote library services in Idaho. Beginning in 1957, the agency was designated as the Idaho recipient of federal funds under the Library Services Act (LSA), and it was appropriated a significant increase in its general fund budget to provide the match necessary to receive the LSA funds. The federal program ev olved over the years, first to the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), and most recently to the Librar y Services and Technology Act (LSTA). LSTA funds are used for pilot projects, to implement collaborative pr ojects among Idaho libraries, and for statewide library programs that offer benefits to all Idaho residents. Other significant benchmarks in the agency's history include: In 1972, legislation passed that charged the agency with distributing Idaho state public documents through a system of depository libraries. In the same year, the State Legislature directed the agency to establish a library for the blind and others who could not use regular print materials. In 1984, library development services (continuing lib rary education, consultant services, and statewide planning) were expanded as a response to major chan ges occurring in the public library community. In 2002, after a 20% budget cut over two years, the Board discontinued several direct services and revised the agency mission to focus on statewide library dev elopment. With legislation passed by the 2006 Legislature, that mission was codi fied, the name of the agency was changed to the Idaho Commission for Libraries to better reflect its activities, and the Board was renamed the Board of Library Commissioners. The 2008 legislative session produced two more subs tantial changes in the agency. The resulting FY2009 appropriation included ongoing operati ng and personnel funds for five (5) new positions to implement and maintain the programs: Legislation amended IC 33-2505 by replacing the state documents depository library system with a digital repository for state publications and instit uting simpler requirements for compliance. The first of a planned 2-year line item request for st ate funds to significantly expand the Read to Me early literacy program was approved. Our customers, Idaho's libraries, tell us that consistent with national trend s the demand for their services is growing. Idahoans (kids, adults, stud ents, parents, business people) want traditional library services, 24/7 electronic information services, and a place - physical or virtual, local and global - to participate in community conversations. The libraries' challen ge is to plan for and maintain the ne cessary trained staff, collections, and technology to deliver this range of services when and where people want them. Our challenge is to help Idaho libraries sustain their services and thrive in this rapidly changing environment. 93Libraries, Idaho Commission for Performance Measurement Report Core Functions/Idaho Code Consistent with our mission, the core function of ICFL is statewide library development. We provide continuing library education and consultant services to the Idaho library community, co ordinate statewide library programs, administer grant programs for library development purpos es, advocate for library services, and facilitate planning for library development at the local, cooperative, and state levels. Other functions include the management of the digital repository for state publicatio ns and the Idaho talking book service.

The increase in LiLI-Unlimited measures (see below) is largely due to school libraries joining the project and making their collections available for loan statewide. The sustained increase in registrations at summer reading programs is due in part to public libraries partnering with schools to promote summer reading to kids and their parents. Working in collaboration with representative teacher-l ibrarians from throughout t he state, the Idaho Library Association, staff of the Department of Education, and the First Lady's Office, the Commission continues to develop several initiatives to increase the capacity of school libraries to serve their students and teachers. Collection of baseline data and subsequent annual statistics on Idaho school library services and resources, Launch of an impact study in March 2009 to assess h ow Idaho students, teachers, and principals benefit from strong scho ol libra ries, Annual professional development oppo rtunities for teacher-librarians fo cusing on their role in student success, and Development of a statewide scope and sequence of the information, communication, and technology competencies students should have as they pass through grade levels.

Eighteen years after the Idaho Territory was established in the midst of civil war and westward expansion, and nine years before statehood in 1890, a roomful of early settlers created the Historical Society of Idaho Pioneers. As technology and time itself accelerated in the late nineteenth century, several of these founders sensed how much of their own heritage was about to be lost and how much native heritage remained to be discovered. Their efforts led to the establishment of the Idaho State Historical Society (ISHS) as a state agency in 1907. The society has evolved in its first century to an extr aordinary system of cultural and historic resources, comprised of the Idaho State Historical Museum, Public Archives and Research Library, State Historic Preservation Office, Historic Sites Program, and Agency Ad ministration. Under the dire ction of a board of seven trustees, who represent the judicial districts of the stat e and with support from the Foundation for Idaho History, a staff of fifty professionals and 200 volunteers, and facilit ies statewide, the society no w serves annually more than 100,000 people on-site and reaches an additional 700,000 on its web site. The Idaho State Historical Museum is accredited by the American Associ ation of Museums and is the largest and most visited museum in the state. Its many interactive programs add value to the state, illuminating Idaho's history through public programs which are authentic, relevant and exciting for children, students, families, adults, tourists, and newcomers. The Idaho History Center in Boise houses the agency's administrative office, and the Public Archives and Research Library provides public and scholarly access to holdi ngs in many media dealing with Idaho history, local history, and genealogy. These include manuscrip ts, state archives, books, periodicals, oral history interviews, films and videos, microfilms, and maps. The Office of the State Historian is located in north Idaho, in Moscow. This Historic Sites program oversees sites at Pierce, Franklin, Rock Creek, and Boise. These include the old federal Assay Office, a national historic landmark, where t he State Historic Preservation Office is located and the old federal Bureau of Reclamation building on Broadway Avenue, which we lease to Foothills International Baccalaureate School. Under the terms of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the State Historic Preservation Office administers the National Register of Historic Places and the state's historic and archae ological site inventories, the certified local government program, and the tax incent ive program, and carries out federal project review duties. In 1992 the state legislature established the Archaeological Survey of Idaho with collections repositories in Pocatello, Boise, and Moscow. Mission Statement Idaho State Histori cal So ciety (ISHS) preserve s and promotes Idaho's cultural heritage Vision Statement of Purpose Our visi on is to inspire, e nrich an d engage all Idahoan s by leading the state in preserving and sharing our dynamic cultural heritage. Core Functions/Idaho Code People have wrested a living from Idaho's remarkable reso urces for more than 13,000 years. Our state has a rich history and prehistory, and the Idaho State Historical Society is charged with responsibility for its preservation and promotion in accordance with Chapter s 41 and 46 of Title 67 of the Idaho Code and other statutory capacity assigned by Titles 9, 14, 27, 31, 33, 50, 49, 58, and 63. The society serves as an agency of the State Board of Education, with oversight provided by a seven member board of trustees. 97Historical Societ y, Idaho State Performance Measurement Report Revenue and Expenditures: Revenue FY 2005 FY 2006 of Cases Managed and/ or Key Services Provided Cases Managed and/or Key Services Provided FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 11,428 10,828 12,458 15,354 Number of Paid Visitors Annum 21,845 32,600 26,979 32,735 Number of Students (K-12) Served by Educational Programs at the Historical Museum 5,200 14,758 14,537 15,000 Number of Students Participating in Idaho History Day Contest 992 1,213 1,100 1,100 SHPO federal project reviews 1,185 1,152 1,010 1,151 Number of Paid visitors to the Old Pen Site NA 21,043 23,852 23,539 Performance Highlights Promoting Responsible Government So that it could become more co nnected with affiliated institutions and colleagues in Idaho, ISHS began a new Community Forum initiative in 2007. The goal of this program was to create a conversation with constituents statewide, provide an ISHS agency update and information about national initiatives, and hear the concerns, needs, and successes of cultural colleagues and their programs. In FY 2008, we conducted community forums in Jerome, Rupert, Ha iley, Coeur d'Alene, Moscow, Weiser, Franklin, and Sandpoint. Society staff served on the Capitol Commission coor dinated the inventory and tr ansfer of statehouse art, furniture, and records and planned for the restoration of historic materials. Staff also coordinated with all agency personnel within the statehouse. Working join tly with the State Reco rds Center, ISHS staff implemented records training for statehouse agenc y staff, housed all stat ehouse agency records, cataloged records, and provided daily courier service for all agencies displaced by the renovation. In FY 2008, 21% of the Idaho State Historical Society's expenditures, amounting to $920,564.62, were funded by grants. Leveraging some general funds with grants has allowed the society to accomplish the following: o Restoration and repair of historic sites - $138,700 o Creating a statewide digital consortium - $84,900 o Processing and indexing of Idaho Penitentiary inmates files - $75,941 o Operate State Historic Preservation Office - $619,100 o Create a Freemason Exhibit at Historical Museum - $5,000 o Fund Lewis and Clark Discovery Trail - $14,800 o Conduct research at pre-historic Cougar Bar - $15,100 o Collect Archeological Data - $26,900 o Operate Children's Summer Camp - $6,200 98Historical Societ y, Idaho State Performance Measurement Report The Idaho State Historical Museum was awarded national accreditation by the American Association of Museums. Accreditation is a widel y recognized seal of approval; less than 10% of our nation's museums enjoy this credential! Accred ited status signifies that a museum fulfi lls its obligations to the public as set forth in its mission and recognizes a museums' commitm ent to excellence, public service, accountability, and high professional standards. Idaho Receives American Association for State and Local History Awards - Since 1904, the American Association of State and Local Hist ory has served as the only comprehensive national organization dedicated to the fields of state an d local history. AASLH Awards of Me rit went to two Idaho groups in 2008: Idaho Transportation Department for the pres ervation and restoration of the Rainbow Bridge on Highway 55 and Timberline High School for the Boise Architecture Project, a student project to record Boise architectural styles. State Historian and Associat e Director Keith Petersen served as the Regional Director of the AASLH Awards Progra m, where he represented the states of Idaho, Alaska, Washington, and Oregon. Idaho State Co-Chairs included State Historic Preservation Office (ISHS) staff members Suzi Pengilly and Shelby Day. ISHS established a formal partnership with Idaho's fi ve tribes to assist the agency in interpretation of historic sites, exhibition development and related projects. Enhancing Economic Opportunity Plans to expand its State Historical Museum by 40 ,000 square feet, culminating in a new 75,000 square foot museum: Museum expansion will meet the needs of Idahoans and provide additional value to the state through the creation of a world-class museum which will be a place of learning for families, educators and children. New auditorium and classroom space will allow the Idaho State Historical Society to enhance educational opportunities for the Treasure Valley and statewide. The museum collaborated with Idaho's Abraham Linc oln Bicentennial Commission to feature \"Lincoln and Idaho\" and \"Forever Free,\" two exhibits on the life of Abraham Lincoln. Featuring the sixteenth president of the United States, the Lincoln and Idaho exhibit is currently traveling the state. The Pacific Northwest Historic Preservation Field School is a partnership between our Idaho State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), Idaho Stat e Parks, Washington and Oregon SHPOs and State Parks, the National Park Service and the University of Oregon. This year, the field school was hosted at Heyburn Lake State Park (the first state park in the northwest), and the park benefited by condition assessment of all structures within the park and the complete restorat ion of one of the large, historic Civilian Conservation Corps picnic shelters. This proj ect realized three times the benefit of its materials investment, saving the state of Idaho approximately $150,000 through in-kind labor; it strengthened partnerships and camaraderie between agencies, preser ved these historic building s and developed the skills of the 46 students from Idaho and from throughout the country Empowering Idahoans Idaho students Joel, Isaac and Jordan Diann Scha efer (Coeur d'Alene) and Chloe Peterson and Silas Domy (Kellog) received special recognition at this year's National History Day competition at College Park, Maryland, June 15-19. Sponsored in Idaho by the Idaho State Historical Society under the direction of the State History Museum, National History Day engages thousands of Idaho students in history each year, providing them with an opportunity that chal lenges their creativity and instills leadership while meeting new graduation requirements. In response to needs expressed through ISHS community forums and a recent study by the Idaho Association of Museums, the board of trustees has implemented a Community Enhancement Grant pilot program to provide financial support for collections care and preservation, enhancement of public access/interpretation, and development of a vibrant statewide cultural industry. 99Historical Societ y, Idaho State Performance Measurement Report Part II - Performance Measures Performance Measure FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 Benchmark Number of Daily Page Views on the Web Site (average time spent 23 minutes per user session) 1,197 1,973 2,101 2316 Maintain/exceed previous fiscal year Number of Paid Visitors Museum and Old Penitentiary 41,396 53,643 50,831 56,274 Maintain/exceed previous fiscal year Number of Children Served by Educational Programs at the Museum 5,200 14,758 14,537 15,000 Maintain/exceed previous fiscal year Number of Federal Projects Reviewed for Compliance With Section 106 and Done Within 30 day Deadline * 1,185 1,152 1,010 1,151 100% Cubic Feet of Public Archives 4649 6020 6,423 4,397 Maintain/exceed previous fiscal year Idaho Historical and Archaeological Sites added to the Archeological Survey of Idaho 1,068 1,112 907 908 Maintain/exceed previous fiscal year Performance Measure Notes: *Federal Section 106 compliance reviews determine potential impact to culture properties.

CSI prepares students to l ead enriched, productive, and responsible lives in a global society. Updated mission statement approved by th e CSI Board of Trustees on 04/21/08. CSI's service area is defined in Idaho Code as the eight counties of the Magic and Wood River Valleys and a portion of Elmore County. CSI offers its programs and cour ses at the nearly 350 acre main campus in the center of Twin Falls, as well as at the off-campus centers in Burley (The Mini-Cassia Center), Hailey (The Blaine County Center), Gooding (The Northside Center), and Jerome (Workforce Development Center). Students can choose from a wide range of transfer and prof essional-technical programs - more than 120 program options ranging from short term training courses and certificates to two-year academic and technical degrees. CSI's extensive proprietary microwave system deliver s classes and programs to college stud ents as well as high school students in dual enrollment. The College offers a growing number of online courses for students who cannot attend traditional face-to-face courses due to family or work responsibilities. In order to meet the needs of students and area employers CSI also offers evening, weekend, as well as customized short courses, and summer courses. CSI shows its commitment to lifelong learning through very active community education and workforce training programs. Growing partnerships with Boise State Univer sity, University of Idaho, Idaho State University, and Northwest Nazarene University also give local residents more than two dozen bachelor's and master's degree options without having to leave Twin Falls. As embodied in the Idaho Code, the College of Southern Idaho is governed by a locally elected five member Board of Trustees who manages the Co llege through a total of 428 full-time faculty, administrators and staff. Trustees are elected from within the College District comprised of Jerome and Twin Falls counties. Board members serve four-year terms and are not compensated. The over 23 year average tenure of the Trustees has given continuity and stability to the College. In July of 2005, Dr. Jerry Beck succeede d Jerry Meyerhoeffer as the third President in the College's forty-three year existence. Revenue for the operation of the College comes from a combination of sources including state appropriation, local property taxes, tuition and fees, and counties not in community college districts. The College of Southern Idaho received its first accredita tion in 1968. Since that time, CSI has been continuously accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), a regional postsecondary accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education an d the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Several of CSI's programs are al so accredited by the appropriate accrediting agencies, and graduates are eligible to take the qualifying examinatio ns of the respective state and national licensing and registration bodies and join professional organizations. The College of Southern Idaho provides support and leadership to economic development efforts in South Central Idaho. CSI has been instrumental in recruiting and retaini ng firms that contribute to a 3.1% unemployment rate in Twin Falls (Jerome County 3.5%, Idaho 3.8%, U.S. 5.5%).* CSI is a char ter member of the Southern Idaho Economic Development Organization (SIEDO). Dr. Beck was the founding chairman of SIEDO and he still serves on the Executive Committee. * Idaho Department of Labor http://lmi.idaho.gov// June 2008 CSI partners with industry, school districts and others including sister institutions of higher education. Probably more than any other industry, CSI has developed a relationship with health care providers in the Magic Valley and the State of Idaho. The crit ical shortage of nurses and other health care professionals has prompted the College to expand its programs. Although the number of gr aduates in the RN and PN programs have nearly doubled, there is still a waiting list for these programs. Health science programs will be further expanded with the addition of the new Health Science Center. Groundb reaking for the Center was held on May 16th 2008, construction is slated to begin in September 2008, with an approximate grand opening date in January 2010. 101College of Southern Idaho Performance Measurement Report Core Functions/Idaho Code The College of Southern Idaho was established and is governed under Chapter 21 of Title 33, Idaho Code.

Performance Highlights Online Learning CSI has been offering an increasing number and variety of online courses. The College serves a large rural geographic area and many students with family or work responsibilities choose to take online courses in order to cut down on the commute and save on gas and/or child care. Students are also mo re technologically savvy and often prefer online courses as opposed to the traditional face-to-face delivery. Dual Credit The number of high school students taking CSI dual credit courses has been increasing at a rapid rate. More and more students realize the benef its of earning college credit while still in high school. The College of Southern Idaho recognizes the nationwide movement toward colle giate programs that allow high school students of outstanding academic achievement and/or inclination the opportunity to earn collegiate credit towards an undergraduate degree prior to graduation. CSI accepts high school students as one of its important constituent groups and considers its dual credit programs to be a major part of its off-campus outreach effort. Pass Rate/Licensure/Certification Pass rates for CSI students on professional licensure and certification exams are consistently above the national norms. Outreach Public Service The College of Southern Idaho is commi tted to outreach and public service. Classes are provided on the main campus as well as through the College's four off-campus centers located in Burley (The Mini-Cassia Center), Hailey (The Blaine County Center), Gooding (The Northside Center), and Jerome (Workforce Development Center).

Instruction w ill not commence before Spring 2009. The College of Western Idaho will utilize several sets of facilities beginning January 1, 2009, and continuing through July 1, 2009. Currently, CWI offices are co-located at the Boise State Univer sity-West Campus (BSU) in Ada County. On January 1, 2009, CWI will receive from BSU the entir ety of the three story 66,000 sq.ft building along with 100 acres of property upon which the building sits. The building is a three year old modern, well- maintained classroom facility that houses class rooms, science laboratories, computer labs, distance learning facilities, and faculty and student services areas. Th is building will be used for lower division transfer, general education classes and associate of arts and associate of science degree programs. Presently, no professional-technical programs are planned for this building. On July 1, 2009, the CWI will receiv e from BSU the entirety of the curr ent Canyon County Center facility, 70,000sq.ft. building located in Nampa, Idaho. It sits on fi ve acres of land and is 20 years old. The Canyon County Center is a well-maintained, two story building containing classrooms, computer labs, apprentice ship labs, and student services space. The building will be used for Adult Basic Education classes, lower division general education transfer, professional-technical courses (such as Licensed Practical Nurse), and various non- credit Center for Workforce Development classes and programs. Beginning in January 2009, College of Western Idaho will also offer selected lower division transfer general education classes in both the Boise and Meridian school districts. In keeping with directives from the Northwest Commi ssion on Colleges and Universities, CWI is nearing the completion of an agreement among NWCCU, College of Southern Idaho, and College of Western Idaho wherein CWI will become a contract par tner with CSI. Essentially, through the c ontract partnership, CWI will be allowed to offer CSI approved courses and programs through CWI and offe r credit for credit classes through CSI. This type of partnership is a first for Idaho. The clientele would include high school students who eit her desired to remain closer to home and who either could not afford a university education or who were not academically ready to begin university work, people who were ready to begin professional technical training or who desired to upgrade or retrain, people who had been denied admission to Boise State University, and others desiring incidental course work, both for credit and non- credit. Core Functions/Idaho Code College of Western Idaho is a two-year community college as defined by Idaho Code 33, Chapter 21 and 22.

The Idaho State Historical Society is an extraordinary system of cultural and historic resources comprised of the Idaho State Historical Museum, Public Archives and Research Library, State Historic Preservation Office, and Historic Sites Program. We seek to inspire, enrich and engage all Idahoans by leading the state in preserving and sharing our diverse and dynamic cultural heritage. We have spent the past year changed the way that we do business including: Performing like a team rather than a loosely aligned group of individual functions Adopting policies and procedures that assist us in being better at the business of how we operate Implementing a new marketing approach to create awareness about our services and (hopefully) converting that awareness into action Seeking new opportunities for financial support through a more aggressive program in grants and the creation of a philanthropic infrastructure Challenging our customer service assumptions through a study to identify our strengths and weaknesses and then adapting to meet our customer needs We still need to be better at tracking statistics, more focused on cost-benefit analysis and recapturing costs associated with service delivery and swifter when it comes to shifting resources to meet strategic goals. We also need to challenge our assumptions about old best practices models and be more adept at positive change. We are also already operating at 35% non-state sources for budget support which puts a lot of pressure on staff - while on the one hand, being more entrepreneurial is good, the opposite side of that equation is that we have relied heavily on fees for service to drive our budget support. At some point, the organization reaches diminishing returns in raising new revenue with these limited sources or by grants written at the department level. This is why our fund development plan is so very important. In term s of how I would like to see us viewed by the public, simply put: Relevant Inspiring A trusted resource 114 Good stewards of our historic resources and funds entrusted to us by the public, granting agencies, and donors Valued for the work that we do bringing resources to the state and improving conditions in society What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? Our strategic plan provides purposeful direction for our future, including excellent customer services, a higher public profile, and enhanced fundraising capacity. We need to move forward with one foot in our historic based mission and one foot in always thinking about how we add value to the state and our constituents. We also need to be sure that our business practices enhance our operations at every level so that we are efficient in the deployment of our resources through effective programs and services that benefit the broadest possible needs of our citizens. While this seems clear and logical, it happens systematically through leadership consensus , seeking new models, and providing staff support to learn and adapt to a more entrepreneurial way of thinking. What does the ISHS intends to accomplish? We will enhance communities and enrich the lives of our citizens We will bring new resources to our communities statewide We will advocate for history, historic preservation, and education What is the outcome? We create memories through transformational experiences We inspire learning We connect diverse groups We enhance community pride We foster the importance of place Key Future Projects? Accomplish the expansion of the new Idaho State Historical Museum with an amazing new exhibition: Idaho: The Spirit of the Land and its People. Match the annual State Historic Preservation Grant at $350,000+ annually. Complete the deferred maintenance for sixty historic buildings statewide in the amount of $3.5 million. Provide funding for the Archeological Survey of Idaho, including support of a western repository which would house archeological items excavated in Idaho. This facility would provide environmentally c ontrolled storage of and public access to 20,000 items. Expand facilities and operating costs for the agency's public archives and research library, with particular emphasis on records of enduring historical value. 115 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 116 IDAHO COMMISSION FOR LIBRARIES 325 West State Street Boise, Idaho 83702 ph. 208.334.2150 800.458.3271 Fax: Time Positions: 40.50 Profile of Cases Managed and/or Key Services Provided Cases Managed and/or Key Services Provided FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 7,553,492 2. Performance Highlights: Increase in school libraries joining the LiLl-U nlimited, making their collections available for loan statewide. The sustained increase in registrations at summer reading programs is due in part to public libraries partnering with schools to promote summer reading to kids and their parents. Working in collaboration with representative teacher-librarians from throughout the state, the Idaho Library Association, staff of the Department of Education, and the First Lady's Office, the Commission continues to develop several initiatives to increase the capacity of school libraries to serve their students and teachers. 3.

Strategic Questions: What would your organiza tion like to do differently? What direction do you see your organization progressing? These two questions are directly related in that progress toward our strategic plan helps us define what we want to do differently. Our staff interaction with our customers gives us good and ongoing feedback for planning, implementing, and evaluating services for Idaho libraries. Continuous improvement, with ongoing assessment of our work and looking for better and more efficient processes, has been part of the agency philosophy for over 15 years. More recently we began incorporating systems thinking tools. Consistent with that philosophy, we're trying to increase our ability to balance being responsive to current needs of the library community with challenging libraries to meet the expectations of tomorrow's users. Our focus on the future includes monitoring trends in information technology and in the search for and use of information, and helping build the skills and services librarians will need to meet the emerging demands for information. At a more specific level, our direction includes a number of long term initiatives, identified collaboratively with the library community, to build the capacity of Idaho libraries to better serve all Idahoans: Increasing visibility and local support for Idaho libraries, Developing a sustainable school library development program, Expanding public library services to serve all Idahoans, and Increasing the leverage of collaborative ventures outside of Idaho and beyond the library community Application of continuous improvement, syst ems thinking, and feedback from the library community will help us identify needed changes as we proceed. 118 Agricultural Research Extension 1.

Strategic Questions: What would your organization like to do differently? The Idaho agricultural industry is currently in a considerable state of flux. Since 2001, the livestock industry (beef and dairy) has become the predominant agricultural sector in revenue generated. The dairy industry, currently ranked 4 th nationally, will soon surpass New York in liquid milk production to become the 3rd leading dairy state in the nation behind California and Wisconsin. This is driving growth and development of the Idaho's food processing industry, e.g. cheese, and the associated service sector s. Additionally, agricultural biotechnology is undergoing phenomenal growth and innovation revolutionizing production agriculture impacting management and operations, and enhancing markets for Idaho's commodities. These transitions within Idaho agriculture are also inextricably linked to the dynamics of global supply and demand. Similarly, Idaho's population demographics are markedly changing. Approximately 60% of Idaho's population is located in four major urban areas, Coeur d'Alene, Boise, Twin Falls and Idaho Falls. Rural communities are at risk and the diversity in population is changing with the growth in the Hispanic population. Additionally, individuals and families are facing increasing economic, educational and health challenges. Current resource constraints, our existing base resources and our ability to obtain additional state resources limit our ability to maintain required research and extension programming. In addition, meeting the increasing needs brought about by changing industry, population and economic issues is increasingly difficult. Ther efore, increasing science-based research with the associated technology transfer to provide solutions and options for our stakeholders and Idaho's population is critically needed. We must strategically focus our priorities and organize the Agricultural Research and Extension System (ARES) to increase our flexibility and ability to meet the diverse and changing needs of our clientele. What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? The ARES must enhance its capability through partnerships and funding opportunities. UI Extension is the only agency of the State of Idaho dedicated solely to the non-formal education of children and adult residents. UI Extension has the expertise, experience and desire to serve a more pivotal function in partnering with other State agencies, e.g., Health and Welfare, and local governments whose missions depend upon the transfer of technology, ideas and knowledge to targeted audiences in Idaho. Consequent to providing needed science-based data to use in the transfer of technology and knowledge for solutions to Idaho's agricultural industry and family and consumer issues, nationally recognized research programs which are self-sustaining and nationally competitive must be developed. Greater reliance on and success in obtaining competitive funding must be achieved to fund needed research with less reliance on federal earmarks. In addition, ARES efforts and funding must be prioritized by adjusting land-grant research priorities with Idaho's industry and policy needs and the needs of its population. 120 Forest Utilization Research 1.

Strategic Questions: What would your organization like to do differently? 1. We would like to have more flexibility to r equest additional funds or reallocate funds to more rapidly adapt research and teaching directions to reflect emerging forest issues that impact Idaho's timber industry. For example, we need to be able to fund additional positions to engage in areas of emerging natural resource issues, to conduct additional long-term demonstration projects on the Experimental Forest or in the Forest Nursery that emulate or evaluate best practices, to test new technologies such as mechanical thinning to reduce fire hazards, as well as explore the effects of climate change on forest productivity, and create bio-technologies and products to capitalize on forest biomass. Both applied and basic research is necessary. 2. We believe increased collaboration with state agencies, such as Idaho Department of Lands, Idaho Fish and Game, Idaho Parks and Recreation, Idaho Water Resources, as well as enhanced networks with regional universities and the private sector is necessary. We envision using some of our seasoned, practicing natural resource professionals in our state agencies to demonstrate best practices via video conferencing in our natural resource classes. In return, we would provide students to engage in service-learning and research projects addressing an agency's-identified need where students can practice some aspect of their chosen profession. This experiential education, service learning, and research approach links directly to the University of Idaho's 2005-2010 Strategic Action Plan. What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? 1. Adding additional social and bio-physical scie ntists as well as positions for practicing professionals to insure students receive an enhanced mix of academic and practice- oriented education. This will result in a well-trained workforce that meets the future need of Idaho's forest products sector as well as research to make the industry more efficient and effective. 2. More research focused on bio-materials and fuels, increased utilization of Experimental Forest to demonstrate and evaluate mechanical thinning and other new technologies, and the expansion of the Forest Nursery to include research on native plants needed to address issues of invasive species and restoration ecology. All of these changes will create additional research and practice learning opportunities for our students. 3. It is essential for our students to have access to new technologies used by forest industries and natural resource management agencies. These tools require continued investment by the University and the FUR Program to ensure the workforce we are training is state of the art and allows us to do practical research. 122 Idaho Geological Survey 1.

Strategic Questions: What would your organization like to do differently? Background: Our mission is to provide decision makers, manager s, local jurisdictions, industry, government officials, and private citizens up-to-date geologic information in technol ogically modern formats that are compatible, for example, with Geogr aphic Information Systems (GIS). The survey has experienced a dramatic increase in the demand for geologic products particularly with regard to (1) earth resources (minerals, construction ma terials, energy sources, ground water, tree and crop nutrition, parks and recreation), (2) ge ologic hazards (landslides, earthquakes, and environmental assessments), and (3) geologic mapping and associated baseline geologic information. To meet the demands with limited state resources, the survey currently depends on externally sponsored projects to sust ain research programs and provide geologic information products. 123Desired change: The Idaho Geological Survey would like to expand our information delivery for research, service, and outreach and to better meet the needs of the state that go beyond narrowly focused sponsored projects. This will require additional state resources, especially for operations. What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? The Idaho Geological Survey has made great strides in modernizing its publications and information delivery systems via the Internet. We should expand those capabilities to facilitate efficient and cost-effective distribution of information to users, and keep pace with technology. In addition, the Idaho Geological Survey should increase its cooperation with other state agencies in projects that meet their needs for applied geologic information. Both of these areas, information delivery systems and cooperative st ate projects, will require additional state resources. 124 1.

The fewer federal dollars expended per surveyable project, the more clients that a center is serving per federal dollar. The ratio compares TechHelp's federal dollars expended per surveyable project to the median amount for all federal MEP centers across the country. A ratio below the national median (less than 1.0) indicates that TechHelp is more efficient than most MEP centers. 131*** Bottom-line Client Impact is a calculation of c lient sales and savings divided by federal dollars expended. The higher the impact per federal dollar, the more effective that a center is. The ratio compares TechHelp's bottom-line client impact to the median amount for all federal MEP centers. A ratio above the national median (greater than 1.0) indicates that TechHelp is more effective than most MEP centers. 4. Strategic Questions: What would your organization like to do differently? TechHelp would like to expand its offering of Grow th services in order to generate even greater economic impact for Idaho manufacturers. Growth services assist manufacturers to grow revenue and jobs through new products, new services and new markets. Companies have two basic strategies available to them to achieve competitiveness. They can cut costs and/or grow revenue. The most competitive companies pursue both strategies. In its twelve years, TechHelp has excelled at teaching companies to cut costs through services like Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, and ISO 9000. For example, in the last four years, TechHelp's clients have attributed $80.9 million in sales, $28.7 million in savings, and 1,458 jobs as direct results of their projects with TechHelp. Most of this success has been achieved through cost-cutting strategies. To meet the needs of Idaho's manufacturers, Tec hHelp must expand its services to teach companies to grow revenue also. Through the New Product Development Laboratory at BSU, TechHelp is already assisting manufacturers with product design, prototyping and testing. An expansion of Growth services would allow TechHelp to take advantage of proven tools developed by its federal sponsor - such as Eureka! Winning Ways for developing new products and ExporTech for entering overseas markets - to lead Idaho manufacturers to stronger competitiveness and job growth. The most competitive companies practice both strategies diligently - cutting costs and growing revenue. The need for cost-cutting services does not disappear with the introduction of Growth services. Continuous improvement is just t hat: continuous. Leading companies like Toyota continue to pursue lean improvements aggressi vely even after 40 years of continuous improvement. With the expansion of Growth services, TechHelp will teach Idaho manufacturers to continuously innovate their pr oducts, services and markets as well as their production processes. What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? TechHelp is an effective and well-functioning partnership of the state's three universities. The next step for TechHelp is to expand the reach of its partnerships by developing more integrated working relationships with the state's community colleges, Department of Commerce, Department of Labor and local economic development organizations to coordinate the seamless delivery of our complementary services. Each of us has a clear role to play in t he development of job opportunities and the preparation of candidates for those job opportunities. The universities educate engineers, managers, IT specialists and accountants. Our community colleges train computer-controlled machine operators, equipment maintenance specialists, bookkeepers and welders. The Department of Commerce and local economic development organizations recruit companies and create incentives for the organic growth of Idaho companies. The Department of Labor matches job 132seekers with employers and funds training fo r new skills. TechHelp teaches workers and managers to continuously improv e competitiveness through process and product innovations. We are each driving towards the same goal and providing a needed service in the journey of each worker and employer. To varying degrees, eac h of us already integrates our services seamlessly. Where this has not happened as well yet, the reason is not for lack of desire. Truly effective partnerships take time to develop and to maintain. Each of us is committed to the continuous improvement of our own partnerships. As those partnerships develop and mature, we will provide even greater impact for Idaho's students, workers and employers. 133 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 134 1.

Strategic Questions: What would your organization like to do differently? Family Medicine Residency of Idaho would like to grow and expand our mission of educating outstanding family physicians in our three year post medical school Family Medicine training program and provide greater clinical medical se rvice to Ada County and the State of Idaho. We would like to do this by expanding our current Residency program from a 10-10-10 program (number of Family Medicine residents in each year of training) to a 15-15-15 program over the next five years. By growing our size, we meet both of our missions of increasing family physicians for the State of Idaho and providing more clinical medical service to Ada County and the State of Idaho. 135 What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? Family Medicine Residency of Idaho, by direction of Governor Otter, and Idaho's ranking of 49th out of 50 in the number of primary care physi cians to population. We already are seeing a massive shortage of primary care physician and aging populations in need of patient-centered, primary care medical homes. We wish to continue to provide an outstanding family medicine training program to prepare future family medi cine physicians by further expansion of the Boise Family Medicine Residency training program, c ontinued development of Rural Training Tracks throughout Idaho, as well as to develop fellowships in Geriatric and Palliative Care, Obstetrics, Rural Family Medicine, and HIV/Primary Care. This will help meet the anticipated primary care work force f or Idaho. 136 ISU - Family Medicine Residency 1.

Chris Schneider and M. Wayne Ayers for Year 1 of a 2-year proposal for the Idaho Bovine Veterinary Experience Program (IBVEP). Year 1 funding allowed four 1st or 2nd-year veterinary students to each spend six weeks working with veterinarians or directly on the dairies. The primary objective is to use an aggressive mentoring program to increase the number of food supply veterinarians graduating from veterinary school and practicing in Idaho. Additional objectives include a) providing posit ive exposure of modern animal agriculture to an increasingly suburban veterinary school demographic b) increasing the amount of veterinary school graduates supported under the WOI veterinary training program that return to Idaho to practice c) increasing the level of Spanish language skills in program participants. The hypothesis is early mentorship on farms and with food animal veterinarians in Idaho will accomplish these objectives. 143 4. Strategic Questions: What would your organization like to do differently? We, in the WI (WOI) Veterinary Program feel keenly the challenge of attracting Veterinary Students into Food Animal Medicine. There is no problem attracting students into Small Animal Medicine but with the advent of fewer and fewer families involved with agriculture, students must be recruited from non-agriculture backgrounds. This interest in food animals must really be encouraged before students actually begin their Veterinary training. In order to influence students at an earlier point in their life, we need to be more involved in the interaction of the University with high school education, Univ ersity undergraduate education, volunteerism and involvement in Extension youth Programs. What direction do you see yo ur organization progressing? I believe that we will be spending more time and effort on Idaho students earlier in their education in an effort to attract them to a career in Food Animal Veterinary Medicine. For example, the Caine Center, in conjunction with the UI College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, is now spending effort working with Idaho High School Ag and FFA teachers helping them with offering introductory courses in Livestock care and management. These courses give dual credit for high school graduation and toward a degree in the UI curriculum in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. We believe we can identify potential students who may be swayed at an early point in their life to have an in terest in food animal veterinary medicine as a career. Another example of this trend is a pilot program coordinated by the Caine Center called the Idaho Bovine Veterinary Experience Training (IBVET) finance through grants from the Idaho Dairymen. Potentially interested students are identified and given a summer internship working on a dairy and the following year working with a Food Animal Practitioner. Four students started this Program during the summer of 2008 under the mentorship of Drs. Chris Schneider and Wayne Ayres of the Caine Center. So far, it appears to be hugely successful. 144 1.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Educat ion Governing Policies & Procedures, Sections I.A.5. and III.P.7. BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION Current Board policy defines a \"full-ti me\" undergraduate student as any student carrying eight (8) or more credits (o r equivalent in audit and zero-credit registrations) and graduate students on full appointments (instructional and graduate assistants), r egardless of the number of credits for which they are registered. A review of policy history i ndicates that this def inition has not been revised in well over 10 years. The attached revision of Boar d policy will align the Board' s definition of a full time student with Federal Financial Aid Guidelin es and reduce confusion to students. This definition is also consistent with WICHE and other national definitions. IMPACT This revision will align the Board's defini tion of a full-time student so that it is consistent with the Federal Financial Aid definition, as well as with national standards. While the impact of these changes will increase the number of undergraduate credits from 8 to 12, in order to be consi dered a full-time student. This change will not limit the total number of credits that a student can take and will not impact the overl oad fee institutions can assess when students take a higher number of credits. The Federal definition of a full-time undergraduate student is already required for all federal reports, and therefore, this change will have no impact at t he federal level. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 2 - Revised Governi ng Policy Section III.P. Page 3 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The revised policies will allow the institut ions to consistently apply financial aid policies. CAAP and the VP's of Finance have both reviewed and approve the proposed change to the full-time student definition. If any additional comments or concerns are received t hey will be brought to t he Board at the December meeting. Staff recommends approval.

Chapter 59, Title 67, Idaho Code, and other applicable stat e and federal laws. 2. Sexual Harassment Each institution must establish and mainta in a positive learni ng environment for students that is fair, humane, and responsibl e. Sexual discrimination, including sexual harassment, is inimical to any institution.

Academic Freedom and Responsibility Institutions of postsecondary education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interests of eit her the individual st udent or the institution as a whole. Academic freedom is fundamenta l for the protection of the rights of students in learning and carries with it res ponsibilities as well as rights. Membership in an academic community imposes on students an obligation to respect the dignity of others, to acknowled ge the right of others to express differing opinions, and to foster and defend intellec tual honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction, and free expressi on on and off the campus of an institution. Expression of dissent and attempts to produce chang e may not be carried out in ways which injure individuals, damage institutional facilit ies, disrupt classes, or interfere with institutional activities. Speakers on the ca mpuses must not only be protected from violence but must also be given an opportunity to be heard. Those who seek to call attention to grievances must do so in ways that do not significantly impede the functioning of t he institution. Students are entitled to an atmo sphere conducive to learning and to fair and even treatment in all aspects of student-teacher relationships. Teaching faculty may not refuse to enroll or teach a student because of the student's beliefs or the possible uses to which the student may put the knowledge gained from the course. Students must not be forced by the aut hority inherent in the inst ructional role to make personal or political choices.

When economic and other conditions permit, the [institution] tries to provide ad vance notice of such changes. In particular, when an instructional program is to be withdrawn, the [institution] will make every reasonabl e effort to ensure that students who are within two (2) years of completing graduation requirements, and who are making normal progress toward completion of those requirements, will have the opportunity to complete the program which is to be withdrawn. No employee, agent, or represent ative of an institution ma y make representations to, or enter into any agreement with, or act toward any student or person in a manner which is not in conformity with Board Go verning Policies and Procedures or the approved policies and procedures of the institution. 5. Student Records The collection, retention, us e, and dissemination of student records is subject to the requirements of the Family Educationa l Rights and Privac y Act of 1974, as amended, and implementing regulations.

The Council was created within the Department of Labor with the purpose of advising the Governor, Legislatur e, State Board of Education, state colleges and universities as well as other agencies and organizations on nursing workforce issues . The Council is comprised of 22 member s representing the Governor's office, Legislature, Office of the State Board of Education, Idaho's colleges and universities' nursing programs, rura l and urban hospitals, Department of Labor, Idaho Board of Nursing, and Idaho Allianc e of Leaders in Nursi ng. A membership list is provided in Attachment 1. The Council has held several meetings since November 2007 an d most recently held a meeting on September 15, 2008.

The council's charge is to define the scope of the perceived problem, address supply / demand and develop strategies to ensure Id aho has an adequate supply of nurses for future expansions. In the meantime, several buildings are being built to expand nursing education in Idaho. Efforts to fund the facult y positions needed to carry the programs are critical. Without the ability to educate, recrui t and hire additional nursing faculty, Idaho will have great difficulty addressing the shortage of nurses. Progress to Date Leaders in education, govern ment and industry are working together to define the issue, streamline data collection and develop workable reco mmendations. Their efforts have resu lted in substantial savings and improved data. A statistical picture of the current status of the nursi ng occupation in Idaho will be finalized in October. A full report and recommendations will be delivered to Governor Otter in November. Draft Goals / Objectiv es / Recommendations Address faculty needs. Expand educational capacity. Incorporate innovative practices involving the private sector. Establish employment practices that encour age work force retention in all sectors. Ensure the availability of critical wo rk force data and informed planning. Plans for FY09 Finalize and implement the council's recommendations. Seek an investment of Workforce In vestment Act funds to match Idaho Hospital Association scholarships for advanced degrees. Educate legislators on the need to address nursing faculty issues. Upgrade the data collection process at the Idah o Nursing Licensing Board, continue gathering information from healthcare and educational institutions and monitor the supply / demand. Immediate Needs The current charter and funding for th e Idaho Nursing Workforce Advisory Co uncil expires in June of 2009. To continue the progress of the council, legislation will be required this next legislat ive session to remove the sunset and continue funding. Also, Idaho's nursing progra ms and the state's higher education institutions need to share additional data with the Id aho Department of Labor so the agency can identify where graduates receive their degrees and where they are ultim ately employed. Graduate migrations , emigrations and current education pipeline and capacity plans will allow for more accura te supply /demand information and data driven decisions when targeting the allocation of limited resources. 1.

If CAAP recommends approval, the proposal shall be forwarded to the Board for action. Boise State University (BSU) is proposing a Master of Arts in Teaching English Language Arts degree progr am, which would replace t he university's current Master of Arts in English, English Education degree. The first aspect of the proposed change is to discontinue the Mast er of Arts in English, English Education degree, which was intended fo r students with baccalaureate degrees who have returned to the university to seek secondary school teaching certification in English. Recently, to better serve t he needs of such students, the College of Education cr eated a Graduate Certific ate in Secondary/K-12 Teaching. Therefore, the MA in English, English Ed ucation is no longer needed. The second aspect of the proposed ch ange is to replace the discontinued program with a new Master of Arts in Teaching English Language Arts. The new program is designed to meet the needs of practicing teachers from elementary through high school who are interested in learning more about how to support the achievement of their student s in writing, reading, lit erary study, language, and general literacy. In addition, the program is set up to be more flexible than traditional programs, including offerings during weekends and summers, possibly in various locations, to accommodate teac hers' schedules. The program of study and many courses will address literacy-re lated subject matter and teaching skills within the teacher's current instructional context. IRSA TAB 3 Page 1INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 IMPACT There is no fiscal impact with the request to discontinue the Master of Arts in English, English Education degree (see pa ge 14); however, there is some fiscal impact with the request to replace this degr ee with a Master of Arts in Teaching English Language Arts degree as depicted below.

With an average of 10 students per course now, there is sufficient room for the additional 10-15 students expected in the new program, or one or two addition al students in each course. The exception is the need for one additional summer or weekend cour se specifically designed for the students (teachers) in this degree program. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Notices of Intent Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BSU's request for an M.A. in Teaching English Language Arts was not listed in their Eight-year Plan for Delivery of Academic Programs in the Southwest Region. BSU indicated that the need to make the program change did not become apparent until after formulation of the Eight -Year plan; however, the IRSA TAB 3 Page 2INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 change is consistent with identified needs. IRSA, CAAP, and Board staff recommends approval as presented. BOARD ACTION A motion to approve the request by Boise State University to discontinue their M.A. in English, Englis h Education and replace it with an M.A. in Teaching English Language Arts as presented. Moved by __________ Seconded by _____ _____ Carried Yes _____ No _____ IRSA TAB 3 Page 3INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK IRSA TAB 3 Page 4IRSA TAB 3 Page 5 Revised 8/9/06 Page 2Before completing this form, refer to Board Policy Section III.G. (Program Approval and Discontinuance). 1. Briefly describe the nature of the request e.g., is this a new program (degree, program, or certificate) or program component (e.g., new, discontinued, modified, addition to an existing program or option). The proposed new Master of Arts in Teaching Englis h Language Arts is designed to meet the needs of practicing teachers from elementary through high school who are interested in learning more about how to support their students' achievement in writing, reading, literary study, langua ge, and general literacy. The field of literacy teaching is broad, and this program acknowledges and reflects this breadth by combining course work from several existing univers ity resources, including: courses offered by the English department, the Literacy Education department in the College of Education, and the Boise State Writing Project. Also reflecting our teacher populati on, the program is set up to be relatively more flexible than traditional programs, including offerings during weekends and summers, possibly in various locations, to accommodate teachers' schedules. The program is designed with the practicing teacher in mind: the program of study itself and many particular courses will address literacy-related subject matter and teaching skills within the teacher 's current instructional context. The dominant theme of the program is that of connecting research and theory in literacy learning with effective classroom teaching practices. The proposed new M. A. will replace the existing Englis h Education emphasis of the Master of Arts in English, which is being discontinued via a separate Notice of Intent. The existing M. A. emphasis was designed for post-baccalaureate students who return to the university to earn a secondary school English teaching certificate. The recently established Graduate Certificate Program in the College of Education now provides for this need and so the existing English Education emphasis is no longer needed. At the same time, the original English Masters degree wh ich was long ago intended mainly for teachers has since then become much more speci alized in the study of literature or rhetoric and composition, not secondary level teaching. The proposed M. A. would bring us back to our original purpose. 2. Provide a statement of need for program or a program modification. Include student and state need, demand, and employment potential. Attach a Scope and Sequence, SDPTE Form Attachment B, for professional-technical education requests . (Use additional sheets if necessary.). This program fills a gap because English and literacy teachers in the Boise area (and indeed throughout southwestern Idaho) lack many continuous high-quality professional development opportunities and graduate programs of study that meet their speci fic needs as teachers of literacy and the English language arts. Other programs, such as those offered by the University of Phoenix or Leslie College, are completed largely on-line and do not offer extended specific coursework in the language arts, or the rigor and personal relationships that will be offered through this proposed degree. Local teacher interest in professional development opportunities and graduate study at Boise State University has been apparent during the past three years, over 450 area teachers applied for admission into the invitational National Writing Project program held at Boise State. All 25 invitees in 2005, and all 27 in 2006 and 2007 accepted their invitation. Of these 79 teachers, about 40 indicated serious interest in pursuing an M.A. in English/language arts at Boise State. We believe that the Boise State Writing Project, then, could act as a springboard for further graduate work and professional development with the general goal of improve ment of teaching effectiveness in literacy. While one incentive for students to enroll in the propo sed Masters program stems from the fact that local teachers can move up the salary scale by earning gra duate credits and degrees, we have found that good teachers are always looking for high- quality professional deve lopment programs that address their teaching questions and needs. Currently the Boise State Writing Project has a database of over 450 teachers who IRSA TAB 3 Page 6 Revised 8/9/06 Page 3have attended or indicated interest in our professiona l development activities - this provides a rich starting point for recruitment for the proposed program. Also, sev eral studies over the past thirty years indicate that up to 50% of new teachers leave the profession in the first five years due in large part to lack of mentorship and professional development -making this a top con cern for schools and school leaders, and a need, we believe, that can be addressed in part by the proposed degree program. 3. Briefly describe how the institution will ensure the quality of the program (e.g., accreditation, professional societies, licensing boards, etc.). The three major strands (writing/composing, reading/lite rature, language) in the program of study reflect the three areas of concentration required by the national st andards for English language arts teachers articulated by the National Council of Teachers of English (NC TE ) and National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and required by the National Pr ofessional Board of Teaching Standards (NPBTS). Quality will be ensured by accreditation of the academic program by three entities. The English department regularly undergoes accreditation review, and all English degree programs (including the proposed program) are evaluated in this review. In addition, since teacher education is a main focus of this degree, it will also be reviewed by both the Idaho State Department of Education and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) whenever teacher edu cation units at Boise State University undergo accreditation review . 4. Identify similar programs offered within the state of Idaho or in the region by other colleges/universities. If the proposed request is similar to another program, provide a rationale for the duplication. This may not apply to PTE programs if workforce needs within the respective region have been established. Idaho State University's Master of Education with Literacy Emphasis is a much more general education degree than the proposed BSU degree. A College of Education degree, the ISU program requires, among other courses, Applied Educational Statistics and Theories of Learning. Even ISU's courses like Psychology of Literacy, Remediation of L iteracy Problems, Clinical Methods in Literacy, Developmental Literacy reflect a central focus on educational psychology. Instead, the BSU program would be derived more from best teaching appr oaches and teaching practices in literacy/ English language arts, applied within the classroom settings of the teachers in the program. University of Idaho's Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) is an English department degree. Its culminating project is somewhat similar to th e BSU portfolio in its emphasis on classroom-based, hands-on applications of learning, but the mode of assessment (project vs. portfolio) is different. A more significant difference is that coursework at U of I requires only one course on teaching writing, and only one on language/linguistics (without teaching a pplications), and all the rest are literature courses. The BSU Masters in Teaching English Language Arts requires students to spread their coursework more evenly across the three literacy areas of reading/literature, writing, and language, and each area specifically requires advanced study of teach ing skills in that area. In addition, the BSU program is intended for teachers of any subject (not just English), and any grade level (not just high school) whose teaching effectiveness would be enha nced by advanced understanding of methods for teaching literacy to their K-12 students. Finally, although the University of Idaho does have the only other National Writing Project site in the state, their M.A.T. does not make room to use credits earned in their writing project. The BSU proposal, however, assumes that the writing project experience, shown by research to be a more effective model of t eacher professional development than university course work alone, deserves a legitimate place in our Masters degree. Finally, of course, many potential Master's students who are teachers in or near the Treasure Valley IRSA TAB 3 Page 7 Revised 8/9/06 Page 4cannot travel to Pocatello or Moscow for course wo rk and rely upon programs offered by Boise State University or its private competitors in the Treasure Valley.

Describe how this request is consistent with the State Board of Education's policy or role and mission of the institution. (i.e., centrality). Included in Boise State University's academic and program plan is a primary emphasis on teacher education. We believe that the proposed program will enhance teacher education for practicing teachers, thereby enhancing the education of thousands of K-12 students. In addition, the institutional mission highlights offering graduate degrees that are consistent with state needs; these need s, we believe, include enhancing teachers' professional knowledge and teaching skills. The proposed program at the same time provides continuing education and technical and workforce training, which are also central to Boise State University's institutional mission. 6. Is the proposed program in the 8-year Plan? Indicate below. Yes No X If not on 8-year plan, provide a justification for adding the program. We are essentially replacing one program with another that is better designed and more closely focused on the prospective students.

Attach a Scope and Sequence, SDPTE Form Attachment B, for professional-technical education requests . (Use additional sheets if necessary.). The Master of Arts in English, English Education degree was intended for students with Bachelors degrees who have returned to the university to seek secondary school teaching certif ication in English. Recently, to better serve the needs of such students, the College of Education has created a Graduate Certificate in Secondary/K-12 Teaching. Deleting our current degr ee program puts us in line with parallel secondary- level teacher education programs across Boise State Univer sity that have also conformed to the College of Education's graduate certificate program. The deleted program will be replaced by a new program l eading to the degree of Master of Arts in Teaching English Language Arts, focused on e nhancing the knowledge and skills of practicing teachers of literacy. 3. Briefly describe how the institution will ensure the quality of the program (e.g., accreditation, professional societies, licensing boards, etc.). The Department of English will ensure that the program will be discontinued in a manner that allows all current students to finish in a manner that ensures the quality of their degree and does not delay them in any way. 4.

If CAAP recommends approval, the proposal shall be forwarded to the Board for action. Boise State University (BSU) anticipat es that during the next 18 months, the College of Western Idaho wil l begin to offer an associ ates-level nursing degree program. In anticipation, BSU proposes to suspend admission to the AS Nursing program effective fall 2008, and to remove the program from the Department of Nursing section of the BS U undergraduate catalog. No additional students will be admitted to the BSU ASN program, and those that have been admitted will be given sufficient advising to enable them to complete the five-semester program by December 2010. Any students who hav e not completed the ASN program by December 2010 will be given the option of transitioning into the Baccalaureate nursing program offered by BSU's Department of Nursi ng. It is Boise State's desire that students still wishing to receive an associ ates-level degree would be able to do so at the Co llege of Western Idaho. Because of the current and future nursing shortage, careful attention has been paid to student numbers, and taken as a whole the changes Boise State is undertaking will yield a greater number of nursing graduates. A short-term decrease in the number of enrolled ASN st udents will occur during the transition. However, because of an increased ca pacity in the baccalaureate nursing program, there will not be a decrease in the number of licensed nurses produced by BSU: the number of baccalaureate nursing graduates from BSU will more than double, from 90 a y ear to 240 a year. Additional ly, Boise State will graduate approximately 10 masters-le vel students per year. See chart illustrated on page 6 of the NOI. IRSA TAB 4 Page 1INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 IMPACT All resources made available by the su spension of our AS Nursing program will be invested in the BS Nurs ing program. Because the re sponsibilities of faculty members are multi-faceted, it is not possible to give a detailed estimate of the amount of funds that would be made available by t he suspension of the AS nursing program. However, for the purpos es of providing an approximation, BSU took the entire appropriated budg et of the Department of Nursing and divided it in half to produce the numbers in the table above. Dividing the budget in half makes sense in that the Department of Nursing will be more than doubling its output of BS Nursing graduates.

Program Approv al and Discontinuance. 1. Briefly describe the nature of the request e.g., is this a new program (degree, program, or certificate) or program component (e.g., new, discontinued, modified, addition to an existing program or option). In anticipation of the impending development of an associates-level nursing degree program to be offered by the College of Western Idaho (CWI), Boise State University (BSU) proposes to suspend admission to the program, effective May 1, 2008, and to remove the program from the Department of Nursing section of the BSU undergraduate catalog. No additional students will be admitted to the BSU AS Nursing program. Any students who have not completed the AS Nursing program by December 2010 will be transitioned into the baccalaureate nursing program offered by the Department of Nursing. 2. Provide a statement of need for program or a program modification. Include student and state need, demand, and employment potential. Attach a Scope and Sequence, SDPTE Form Attachment B, for professional-technical education requests . (Use additional sheets if necessary.). It is anticipated that during the next 18 months, the College of Western Idaho will create and offer an associates-level nursing degree. By suspending admissions to Boise State's AS program at this time, we will reduce the number of students enrolled in BSU's AS program who would need to transfer to the College of Western Idaho program. Because of the current and future nursing shortage, careful attention has been paid to student numbers, and taken as a whole, the changes we are undertaking will yield a greater number of nursing graduates. A short-term decrease in the number of enrolled AS Nursing students will occur during the transition. However, because of an increased capacity in the baccalaureate nursing program, there will not be a decrease in the number of licensed nurses produced by BSU. As can be seen by the table below, the number of baccalaureate nursing graduates will more than double, from 90 a year to 240 a year. Additionally, Boise State will graduate approximately 10 masters-level students per year.

Because the responsibilities of faculty members are multi-faceted, it is not possible to give a detailed estimate of the amount of funds that would be made av ailable by the suspension of the AS nursing program. However, for the purposes of providing an approximation, we have simply taken the entire appropriated budget of the Department of Nursing, divided it in half, and entered the resulting numbers in the table above. Dividing the budget in half makes sense in that the Department of Nursing will be more than doubling its output of BS Nursing graduates.

IRSA TAB 5 Page 4INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Summit Recommendations and Discussion Recommendation One Create an Advisory Council Summit recommendation At least one advisory committee should be formed to provide input, analysis, recommendations, and accountability to the Idaho State Board of Education regarding the education of students who are blind or visually impaired or deaf or hard of hearing. The committee should include a balanced repr esentation of: interest groups from the deaf community, blind community, local educ ation agencies, adminis trators, parents, educators, and other stakeholder groups. Nominations should occur for appointments to be made by the SBOE. * See standard 19 in the standards for the b lind/visually impaired and standard 18 in the standards for the deaf/hard of hearing. IRSA TAB 5 Page 5INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Recommendation Two Differentiate Services for the Education of Students who are Blind/Visually Impaired and Deaf/Hard of Hearing Summit Recommendation 1. Differentiate services for the blind/ visually impaired and deaf/hard of hearing. 2. Consistent services will be provid ed through the regiona l programs for the blind/visually impaired and fo r the deaf/hard of hearing. 3. Separate identities wi ll be created for the deaf/har d of hearing and for the blind/visually impaired. 4. Collaboration will occur with the local education agencies. DISCUSSION The Transition Coordinator and the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind, with the recommendations of the Advisory Co uncil, will create a proposal for the differentiation of services that will be presented to the Board. This recommendation will allow for grow th, improvement upon a system already in place and for the differentiation of services betw een two separate populations of students. IRSA TAB 5 Page 6INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Recommendation Three Relocate the Residential School to a Metropolitan Area for Students who are Blind/Visually Impaired and for Students who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing DISCUSSION Recognizing the need to serve Idaho's stude nts who are blind/visually impaired or deaf/hard of hearing in a residential facili ty, the operation of t he current facility in Gooding should be maintained until the new facility(ies) are established. This recommendation is in alignmen t with standard 21 in the Standards for the blind/visually impaired and standard 20 in the Standards for the deaf/hard of hearing. Supporting this recommendation will align wit h recommendation number 4 of this document, Full Continuum of Services for Children and Youth. To establish a new facility or facilities in a metropolitan area, a plan will need to be developed for seeking: a. Location/space b. Funding A detailed plan for relocation, including w hether one campus/location will house two separate buildings/residential pr ograms (one for the blind/vi sually impaired and one for the deaf/hard of hearing) or if two separate locations will be secured. One campus does not necessarily mean that the two programs cannot be s eparate and differentiated. Consideration needs to be given on how to prov ide efficient services while maximizing differentiation. Summit Recommendation A residential school is needed for the deaf/hard of hearing and for the blind/visually impaired. 1. A vote was taken via a raise of hands of summit participants. The vote indicated the program should be relocated to a metropolitan area to better serve Idaho's students. 2. Why is a residential progr am needed? Examples include: a. Education in the Expanded Core Curri culum for the Blind/visually impaired b. Social opportunities for both populations c. Extracurricular activi ties for both populations d. Funding issues for rural areas e. Serves students with multiple needs f. Incidental learning opportunities g. Unwritten curriculum opportunities h. Intensive language development i. Sense of belonging and its relation to success j. Servicing individual needs k. Provides a needed component to t he full continuum if services IRSA TAB 5 Page 7INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Recommendation Four Adopt and Implement the Full Conti nuum of Service Delivery Options and Placements for Children and Youth Statewide Summit Recommendation 1. The full continuum of serv ices in Idaho will be based on the federal definition: The Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Education Act (IDEIA) of 2004 states: Each public agency must ensur e that a continuum of al ternative placements is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services [Sec. 300 (b)(300)(115)(a)] (2004). Additionally, The continuum required in paragraph (a) of this section must-- (1) Include the alternative placements list ed in the definition of special education under Sec. 300.38 (instruction in regular classes, special classes, special schools, home instruction, and instructi on in hospitals and institutions); and (2) Make provision for supplementary se rvices (such as resource room or itinerant instruction) to be provided in conjunction with regular class placement [Sec. 300 (b)(300)(115)(b)](2004). This recommendation is in alignment with standard 21 in the Standards for the blind/visually impaired and standard 20 in the Standards for the deaf/hard of hearing. 2. Recommendations for Early Inte rvention Services (Birth - 3) a. Continue to include/increase: i. Identification, fa mily support/education 1. Family involvement and support working well ii. Delivery of services iii. Infant/toddler program & services with the Department of Health and Welfare 1. Memorandum of Understanding between agencies iv. Use of technology v. Centralized information ava ilable on a statewide level 3. Recommendations for Services for Ch ildren/Youth ages Three through Twenty-one a. Standardize and avail transiti on services/process statewide b. Services should be family-centered/student-focused c. Improve family involvement/s ervices from birth-3 to 3-21 d. Enforce standards with accountability 4. Recommendations for Post-secondary Services a. Create centralized directory of services b. Moving from family-centered to adult-client centered services c. Intensive training around and in preparation for transitions d. Collaborative services wit h higher education programs 5. Recommendations regard ing the full continuum: a. How to increase services and access to services so students/families have options vi. Use 2-way video conferencing to increase family and educational support IRSA TAB 5 Page 8INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 vii. Regional centers become resource centers for the local education agency (families, teachers, etc.) viii. Medicaid services may provide financial support b. Equitable funding regardless of st udent's placement (residential school, Local Education Agency) c. Year-round school calendar IRSA TAB 5 Page 9INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Recommendation Five Create and Increase Instate Personnel Preparation Programs Summit Recommendation 1. Begin in-state personnel preparation program for Teacher of the Visually Impaired, Certified Orientation and Mobility, and Reha bilitation Teacher of the Blind (the new name is: vision rehabilitation therapists) . The State of Idaho does not have a personnel preparation program for teachers of the visua lly impaired, certifiable orientation and mobility specialists and cert ifiable vision rehabilitation therapists. This recommendation is in alignment with standard 26 in the Standards for the blind/visually impaired. 2. Use marketing techniques in order to recruit more highly capable professionals 3. Provide competitive salary and benefit schedules for professionals and/or recruitment packages 4. Strengthen Teacher of the Deaf and Interpreter Training programs (Current program is located at Idaho State University) 5. Quality of university personnel should be evaluated and approved DISCUSSION The state of Idaho requires t hat a teacher be certified as a Teacher of the Visually Impaired yet the state does not have a Teacher of the Visually Impaired preparation program available. In 2001 Stephen F. Austin Stat e University began preparing teachers in the Northwest (Idaho, Wa shington, Montana, and Wyoming) via synchronous and asynchronous distance education through a federal grant. The grant was a five-year grant awarded from the U.S. Department of Education, which was extended one year. The grant concluded July 31, 2007. Students with visual impairments have uni que educational needs which require special knowledge and experience of the teacher s who. The critical shortage of certified Teachers of students with Visu al Impairments has been a chronic problem for school systems. State law, federal law, and best pr actice in education require districts to provide services to students with visual impairments. Without trained and experienced certified Teachers of the Visually Impaired, students with visual impairments have limited access to a wide range of visual experiences which are essential to obtaining an education that is truly equivalent to the one provided for their sighted peers. One of the most important disability-specific educational needs of students with visual impairments lies in the area of safe mobility in a variety of environments. To address this need, students must have access to regular services from a Certified Orientation and Mobility Specialist. The shortage in certified professionals in the field of visual impairment is just as critical for Ce rtified Orientation and Mobility Specialists as for Teachers of Students with Visual Impairments. Idaho needs an in-state personne l preparation program with state funding to support the program. IRSA TAB 5 Page 10INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Recommendation Six Increase Family and Mentor Involvement Summit Recommendation 1. Family and mentor involvement will be increased. Information and resources to families will be more easily accessible through centralized and shared resources. a. Mentors will be available to families from birth b. Identify mentor in Infant Family Service Plan/Individualized Education Program, which is driven by family and student need c. Mentors for the Deaf/Hard of Hearing - i. organized under the program for the deaf/hard of hearing ii. mentors will receive supervision and support iii. funding will be provid ed for mentor program iv. take advantage of pre-established guidelines/training/curriculum (Gallaudet, Hands and Voices, etc.) v. Mentors will be able to use Am erican Sign Language, Cued Speech, Oral, etc. d. Mentors for the Bli nd/Visually Impaired - i. organized under the program for the blind/visually impaired ii. mentors will receive supervision and support iii. funding will be provid ed for mentor program iv. take advantage of pre-established guidelines/training/curriculum (Texas School for the Blind/VI, Nati onal Federation of the Blind, Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind and Idaho Commission for the Blind/Visually Impaired, etc.) v. Mentors will be able to use braille, technology, low vision aids and devices, etc. e. Locate mentors through Idaho's es tablished service providers and organizations (e. g. Council for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, National Federation of the Blind, etc.) f. Use a variety of technology to connect with families g. Parents as mentors - i. the role of parents as mentors will be defined and differentiated from Deaf or Blind mentors ii. funded, supported, and tr ained under central program iii. parents who have \"walked the walk\" will be available for those who choose h. All mentors will be trained, work under guidelines, and compensated for their time. Their roles/responsibilities will be defined. i. Mentors' training includes k nowledge of all resources and ethical responsibilities to honor family choice j. Family Support - i. classes for parents - accessible via technology 1. braille, orientation and mobility, sign language, language development, etc IRSA TAB 5 Page 11INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 2. opportunities for family short term visits to reside ntial program to specific training/evaluation ii. Regional offices become resource centers for families iii. Establish Idaho Family Support Symposium These recommendations align with Section 5 in the St andards for the blind/visually impaired and Section 5 in the Standards for the deaf/hard of hearing. IRSA TAB 5 Page 12INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 Recommendation Seven Create a Statewide System for Collaborating and Networking of Resources Summit recommendation 1. Create two committees (one for th e deaf/hard of hearing and one for the blind/visually impaired) to plan efficient sharing and networking. a. Committees will share responsibility of gathering, organizing, maintaining and distributing list or resources. b. Committees will define the best system to assure easy access to resources, sharing ideas, knowledge, and expertise statewide. c. The responsibilities of t he committees shall include: i. The development of a clearinghouse, and ii.

Date: _____________________________ ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 22 Boise State University Foundation STATEMENT OF INVESTMENT POLICY JUNE 2007 ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 23Statement of Investment Policy Boise State University Foundation Page 1 Statement of Investment Policy for The Boise State University Foundation INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE The intent of this Statement is to articulate an investment strategy with specific parameters that reflect the philosophy of the Board of Directors (the \"Board'), thereby providing the Investment Committee (the \"Committee\") with clearly defined policies and objectives. Although these policies and objectives are inte nded to govern investment activ ity, they are intended to be sufficiently flexible in order to be practical. INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT The following statements represent the invest ment principles and philosophy governing the investment of funds held by the Boise State University Foundation (the \"Foundation\"). These statements describe the core values and beliefs that form the basis for investment decision making. These commonly held fundamental investment beliefs are: 1. That the single most important decision that the Committee makes is the long-term asset allocation decision. As a result, nearly all of the absolute levels of investment returns are attributable to the Committee's decisions regarding asset al location, not manager implementation. 2. That the capital markets are mean-reverting by nature. The Committee will therefore use long-term strategic asset class allocations and rebalance to thos e allocations within suitable ranges. 3. That the achievement of long-term investme nt goals is derived directly from sound investment strategy decisions and efficient and consistent implementation of the strategy. Ad-hoc asset allocation or manager allocation changes (usually in reaction to recent market performance) are likely to result in poor outcomes th at will impair the long-term performance of the funds. As a result, the Committee will delegate all tactical implementation decisions to its inve stment managers and will avoid ad-hoc re-allocations to any manager or asset class in reaction to recent market conditions. 4. That the achievement of the Foundation's long -term investment goals necessitates that the investment strategy be base d on using a combination of asset classes (and sub-asset classes) that has a reasonable probability of achieving the Foundation's goals. As a REVISION DATE: JUNE 2007 ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 24Statement of Investment Policy Boise State University Foundation Page 2 result, the Committee will periodically conduct asset allocation studies to assess the probability of achieving its long-term goals. 5. That market timing is ineffective as a market strategy for institutional funds. As a result, the Committee will remain fully invested in all long-term mandates and avoid interest rate anticipation as the primary means of adding value in fixed income mandates. 6. That some asset classes are inefficient and act ive managers can clearly add value. Other asset classes, most notably the domestic large-cap equity market, are more efficient. As a result, the Committee will allocate assets between active and passive (index) allocations based on its ability to identify active managers that can add value net of fees and expenses. 7. That it is necessary to use long time frames a nd appropriate benchmarks to fairly evaluate active manager performance. Ac tive managers are, by definiti on, different than a passive index. Differences in manager styles (growth, value) and mark et capitalization will have multi-year cycles. Additionally, active managers may be hired specifically to have different risk characteristics th an popular indices. As a result, even the best performing managers will have periods of both under- and out-performance relative to popular indices. In establishing individual manager investment objectives and in evaluating manager performance: a. The Committee will use long time fram es (rolling 3- and 5-year periods), b. The Committee will set appropriate invest ment objectives using relevant style and capitalization benchmarks, c. The Committee will evaluate mana gers on a risk-adjusted basis. 8. Investment implementation should be cost and resource effective. When evaluating new and current asset classes, managers and implementation strategies, the Committee will evaluate both the implementation and monitori ng costs and requirements, as well as the incremental benefits in terms of both risk and reward to the funds. The Committee will utilize only those investment strategies that are expected to provide meaningful benefits to the funds, net of implementation and monitoring costs and risks.

REVISION DATE: JUNE 2007 ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 28Statement of Investment Policy Boise State University Foundation Page 6 INVESTMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES Objectives and Guidelines Objective: The Investment objective is to provide a ra te of return over inflation sufficient to support in perpetuity the mission of the Foundation. It is particularly important to preserve the value of the assets in real term s to enable the Foundation to main tain the purchasing power of the spending on programs and administration without er oding the real value of the principal corpus of the Foundation. General Investment Considerations and Constraints: Risk: The Committee will seek to limit the overal l level of risk commensurate with the chosen Policy Asset Allocation. Liquidity: At times, cash may be required to satisfy the needs of the Foundation. The Foundation should have sufficient liquid assets to meet such foreseeable requirements. Time Horizon: The Foundation has an infinite life. An investment Time Horizon of twenty years is appropriate. Taxes: The Foundation is tax-exempt. Return Need The long-term net compound return need shall be es tablished as the goal rate of return for the Foundation over the Time Horizon. The Return Goal shall consist of a spending rate, an assumed rate of inflation and investment manageme nt fees. These items and their function in the overall return need are established below: Components of Return Need Return Need Goal Return Spending Rate 4.00% 4.00% Administrative Fee 1.50% 1.50% Inflation Rate 2.50% 2.50% Desired Growth - 1.00%* Long-Term Return Need (Net of Fees) 8.00% 9.00% *Desired growth target incl udes fundraising activities in addi tion to capital appreciation. REVISION DATE: JUNE 2007 ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 29Statement of Investment Policy Boise State University Foundation Page 7 The following goals are designed to support ach ievement of the Foundation's Investment Objective and are net of (a fter) investment expenses. 1. Total Foundation assets should achieve an annualized rate of return equal to or greater than that of the Return Need over trailing five-year time periods. 2. Total Foundation assets s hould return, over tr ailing three year periods, a nominal rate of return greater than or equal to a hypothetical index portfolio consisting of 35% Russell 3000, 26% MSCI-EAFE, 9% MSCI-EMF, 15% Lehman Aggregate 10% Citigroup Inflation Linked Bond and 5% Wilshire REIT Index. Spending Rate Policy Spending Rate The Spending Rate of the Foundati on will be reviewed at least annually in light of evolving trends with respect to invest ment performance and the needs of the Foundation, and will be adjusted as necessary. Unless otherwise directed by the donor for a speci fic endowed gift, the annual Distribution rate shall not exceed 4% of the tra iling 3-year average market value of the Foundation, as determined each December 31st. Total Return Policy The Board has adopted a \"total return\" appro ach to calculating investment returns. In recognition of these facts, th e Committee will consider the F oundation's total return from both income and net realized and unrealized capital gains when recommending the Spending Rate Policy. When distributions are made, they will be withdrawn from the Foundation regardless of the portion of the total return that is from capital gains or from income, subject to applicable gift agreement restrictions. Asset Allocation The single most important decision made by the Committee is the Policy Asset Allocation decision. Investment research has determined that a significant portion of a portfolio's investment behavior can be attr ibuted to: (1) the asset classe s/styles which are employed by the Foundation; and (2) the weighting of each asset class/style. It is the responsibility of the Committee to iden tify the Policy Asset Allocation that offers the highest probability of achievi ng the Foundation's Investment Objectives. The Committee, with guidance and recommendations from their Consulta nt, shall review the asset mix on an ongoing basis and recommend revisions as necessary. The Policy Asset Allocation shall be determined based on a comprehensive asset allocation study completed by the Consultant and reviewed from time to time by the Committee. The Policy REVISION DATE: JUNE 2007 ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 30Statement of Investment Policy Boise State University Foundation Page 8 Asset Allocation of the F oundation, as presented in Appendix A , is designed to give balance to the overall structure of the Foundation's investme nt program over the Time Horizon. However, many factors over time may necessita te an asset allocation revi ew and possible rebalancing. These factors include an ongoing assessment by the Consultant and the Committee of the comparative long-term outlook for all availa ble types of asset classes and styles. Permissible Investments The Policy Asset Allocation of the Foundation is expected to include a wide range of asset classes. These asset classes and their rela tive comparative indices are displayed below. COMPARATIVE INDICES FOR INVESTMENT MANAGERS ASSET CLASS COMPARATIVE INDEX Equity Domestic Equity U.S. All-Cap Stocks Wilshire 5000 U.S. Large Stocks S&P 500 U.S. Large Value Stocks Russell 1000 Value U.S. Large Growth Stocks Russell 1000 Growth U.S. Large Quality Stocks S&P 500 U.S. Mid Stocks S&P MidCap 400 U.S. Small Stocks Russell 2000 U.S. Small Value Stocks Russell 2000 Value U.S. Small Growth Stocks Russell 2000 Growth U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts Wilshire REIT Index International Equity Int'l Large/Mid Stocks EAFE ($US) Emerging Mkt Stocks MSCI Emg.

The Committee may elect to rebalance the portfolio to reach the Policy Asset Allocation at any time. However, the portfolio shall be rebalanced in the event any individual marketable asset class differs from policy ranges (minimum or maxi mum) by more than 20% of the target weight, but with a minimum deviation threshold of 2% of the total portfolio value. The Consultant will inform the Director of Fi nance after the close of any month in which rebalancing is advisable. The C onsultant, together with the Director of Finance, will complete the rebalancing process. The Consultant will assist the Director of Finance as needed in implementing such rebalancing. Other Non-Endowment Assets The Board may, from time to time, establish in vestment portfolios other than the Endowment Fund. Asset allocation and investment guidelines for these portfolios will be developed as needed and, when appropriate, in consultation with the donor. The Foundation is the trustee for se veral charitable remainder trusts and is the beneficiary for other trusts. The Investment Committee shall monitor the activity, investment policy and investment performance of the trusts. The Foundation owns several parcels of real estate as the result of individu al gifts and purchases made in the interest of the University. The Investment Committee has appointed a real estate subcommittee to monitor these properties, revi ew potential gifts and make recommendations regarding disposition to the Board. The trust assets and parcels of real estate are not included in the Foundation's investment asset allocation, nor are they included in the Consultant's purview. Investment Policies for Investment Managers The following are performance goals and constraint guidelines placed on individual managers within specific asset classes: All Traditional Managers 1. Index (passive) managers shall be term inated if performance or volatility significantly differs from that of the benchmark. 2. Active managers may be terminated due to philosophical changes, management turnover, poor long-term investment pe rformance, or other material changes. REVISION DATE: JUNE 2007 ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 32Statement of Investment Policy Boise State University Foundation Page 10 Alternative Investments 1. Alternative investment managers typically must have significant latitude in the strategies and investments they make and th e leverage they introduce into a portfolio. As a result, it is generally not feasible to impose guidelines and restrictions on such managers. Instead, the Committee may choose to terminate a manager, subject to the manager's liquidation policy, if they are di ssatisfied with the manager and/or his strategy. Other 1. Securities Lending: Investment Managers (via a written contract with the Foundation), may engage in securities lendi ng, or the \"loan\" of the Foundation's securities in return for interest, to brok er dealers as a means of enhancing income. 2. Related Party Transaction: The Foundation will not loan funds to related parties, defined as an officer, Board member, Co mmittee member, employee, or donor, either current or prospective. Procedure for Revising the Stat ement of Investment Policy This Statement of Investment Policy will be re viewed at least annually by the Committee. The Board must approve material changes to the St atement. Any deviation from the Policy Asset Allocation of the combined asse t sectors (i.e., total equities, total fixed income, or total alternative investments) would represent a material change an d shall be approved by the Board. Conflicts of Interest All persons responsible for invest ment decisions or who are invol ved in the management of the Foundation or who are consulting to, or providing any advice whatsoever to the Committee, shall disclose in writing at the beginning of any discussion or consideration by the Committee, any relationships, material beneficial ownership, or other material in terest(s) which the person has or may reasonably be expected to have, with respec t to any investment issu e under consideration. The Committee may require such persons to remove themselves from the decision-making process. Any members of the Committee responsible for inve stment decisions or who are involved in the management of the Foundation shall refuse any re muneration, commission, gi ft, favor, service or benefit that might reasonably tend to influence th em in the discharge of their duties, except as disclosed in writing to and agreed upon in writing by the Committee. The intent of this provision is to eliminate confli cts of interest between committee me mbership and the Foundation. Failure to disclose any material benefit shall be groun ds for immediate removal from the committee. This provision shall not preclude the payment of ordinary fees and expenses to the Foundation's custodian(s), Investment Managers, or Consultant in the course of their services on behalf of the Foundation.

Approved 4/9/2008 Page 1 of 6 Policy Effective 4/9/2008 Board of Directors Revised Conflict of Interest Policy v1.1 Boise State Universi ty Foundation, Inc. Conflict of Interest Policy I. Purpose : The Boise State University Foundation, Inc. (\"Foundation\") is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization. Maintenance of its tax-exempt status is important both for its continued financial stability and for public support. Therefore, the IRS as well as state regulatory and tax officials view the operations of the Foundation as a public trust which is subject to scrutiny by and accountable to such governmental authorities as well as to members of the public. Consequently, there exists between the Foundation and Responsible Persons (defined below) and the public a fiduciary duty which carries with it a broad and unbending duty of loyalty and fidelity. Responsible Persons have the responsibility of administering the affairs of the Foundation honestly and prudently, and of exercising their best care, skill, and judgment for the sole benefit of the Foundation. Those persons will exercise the utmost good faith in all transactions involved in their duties, and they will not use their positions with the Foundation or knowledge gained therefrom for their personal benefit. The interests of the organization must be the first priority in all decisions and actions. II. Responsible Persons : This statement is directed to Directors, Officers, all employees and others who can influence the actions of the Foundation (\"Responsible Persons\"). For example, this would include all who make purchasing decisions, all persons who might be described as \"management personnel,\" and anyone who has proprietary information concerning the Foundation. III. Areas in Which Conflict May Arise: Conflicts of interest may arise in the relations of Responsible Persons with any of the following third parties: 1. Persons and firms supplying goods and services to the Foundation. 2. Persons and firms from whom the Foundation leases property and equipment. 3. Persons and firms with whom the Foundation is dealing or planning to deal in connection with the gift, purchase or sale of real estate, securities or other property. 4. Competing or affinity organizations. 5. Donors and others supporting the Foundation. 6. Agencies, organizations and associations which affect the operations of the Foundation. 7. Family members, friends, and other Responsible Persons. IV. Nature of Conflicting Interest: A conflicting interest may be defined as an interest, direct or indirect, with any persons or firms mentioned in Section III. Such an interest might arise through: 1. Owning stock or holding debt or other proprietary interests in any third party dealing with the Foundation. 2. Holding office, serving on the Board, participating in management, or being otherwise employed (or formerly employed) with any third party dealing with the Foundation. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 55Boise State University Foundation, In c. Approved 4/9/2008 Page 2 of 6 Policy Effective 4/9/2008 Board of Directors Revised Conflict of Interest Policy v1.1 3. Receiving remuneration for services with re spect to individual transactions involving the Foundation. 4. Using the Foundation's time, personnel, equipment, supplies, or goodwill for other than Foundation-approved activities, programs and purposes. 5. Receiving personal gifts or loans from third parties dealing or competing with the Foundation. Receipt of any gift is disapproved except gifts of a value less than $50 which could not be refused without discourtesy . No personal gift of money should ever be accepted. V. Interpretation of this Policy: The areas of conflicting interest listed in Section III, and the relations in those areas which may give rise to conflict, as listed in Section IV, are not exhaustive. Conflicts might arise in other areas or through other relations. It is assumed that Responsible Persons will recognize such areas and relation by analogy. The fact that one of the interests described in Se ction IV exists does not necessarily mean that a conflict exists, or that the conflict, if it exists, is material enough to be of practical importance, or if material, that upon full disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances it is necessarily adverse to the interests of the Foundation. However, it is the policy of the Board that the existence of any of the interests described in Section IV will be disclosed before any transaction is consummated. It will be the continuing responsibility of Responsible Persons to scr utinize their transactions and outside business interests and relationships for potential conflicts and to immediately make such disclosures. VI. Disclosure Policy and Procedure: Transactions with parties with whom a conflicting interest exists may be undertaken only if all of the following are observed: 1. The conflicting interest must be fully disclosed. 2. The conflicting interest must be considered by the Board, or, if appropriate a Committee of the Board. 3. The person with the conflict of interest will not participate in or be permitted to hear the Board's or Committee's discussion of the matter except to disclose materials facts and to respond to questions. Such person will not attempt to exert his or her personal influence with respect to the matter, either at or outside the meeting. 4. The person with the conflict of interest with respect to the contract or transaction that will be voted on at a meeting will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum for purposes of the vote. The person who has the conflict of interest may not vote on the contract or transaction and will not be present in the meeting room when the vote is taken, unless the vote is by secret ballot. 5. The Board or Committee will consider whether a competitive bid or comparable valuation exists. 6. The Board or Executive Committee must determine that the transaction is in the best interest of the Foundation. Responsible Persons who are not members of the Board of Directors or who have a conflict of interest with respect to a contract or transaction that is not the subject of Board or Committee ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT TAB 1-A Page 56Boise State University Foundation, In c. Approved 4/9/2008 Page 3 of 6 Policy Effective 4/9/2008 Board of Directors Revised Conflict of Interest Policy v1.1 action, will disclose to their supervisor, the Executive Director, or the Board chair any conflict of interest that such person has with respect to any contract or transaction. Such disclosure will be made as soon as the conflict of interest is known to the Responsible Person. The Responsible Person will refrain from any action that may affect the Foundation's participation in such contract or transaction. A supervisor will info rm the Executive Director of any such conflict of interest. The Executive Director will bring the matter to the attention of the Board or Executive Committee. Disclosure involving Directors will be made to the Board chair (or if she or he is the one with the conflict, then to the Board vice-chair) who will bring these matters to the Board or the Executive Committee. Information acquired in connection with disclosures of conflicts of interest or potential conflicts will be treated as confidential and will generally be made available only as necessary for the implementation of this Policy. The Board or Executive Committee will determine w hether a conflict exists and in the case of an existing conflict, whether the contemplated transaction may be authorized as just, fair, and reasonable to the Foundation. The decision of the Board or Executive Committee on these matters will rest in their sole discretion, and their concern must be the welfare of the Foundation and the advancement of its purpose. Each Responsible Person will be provided with and asked to review a copy of this Policy and to acknowledge in writing that he or she has done so. Any changes to the Policy will be communicated to all Responsible Persons. Annually, each Responsible Person will complete a disclosure form identifying any relationships, positions or circumstances in which s/he is involved that he or she believes could contribute to a conflict of interest.

The following investment objecti ves and directions are to be judged and understood in light of that overall sense of stewardship. In that regard, the basic investment standards shall be those of a prudent investor as articulated in applicable state laws. Investment Assets For purposes of these policies, investment a ssets are those assets of the Idaho State University Foundation that are available for in vestment in the public securities markets as stocks, bonds, cash, or cash equivalents, either directly or through intermediate structures. Illiquid assets are described in the Idaho Stat e University Foundation's gift acceptance policies, and are governed by those rules and not by these investment policies. Supervision and Delegation The Board of the Idaho Stat e University Foundation has adopted these policies and has formed an Investment Committee, described bel ow, to whom it has delegated authority to supervise the Idaho State University F oundation investments. The committee and its counselors will act in accord with this invest ment policy (hereinafter \"policy\"), and all applicable laws and state and federal regul ations that apply to nonprofit agencies including, but not limited to, the Unifo rm Prudent Investors Act and the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act. The Board reserves to itself the exclusive right to amend or revise these policies. Investment Committee It shall be the responsibility of the Investment Committee to: 1. Supervise the overall im plementation of the Idaho St ate University Foundation's investment policies by the Idaho State Univ ersity Foundation's executive staff and outside advisors; 2. Monitor and evaluate the investment per formance of the Idaho State University Foundation's funds; 3. Report at each regularly scheduled meet ing of the Board on Foundation investment matters including financial performance: ATTACHMENT 2 AUDIT TAB 1-B Page 23 Policy VD Investments Page 2 4. Develop and annually update an investment policy, asset a llocation strategies, risk- based fund objectives, and appropriate in vestment management structures and provide the same to the Board; 5. Execute such other duties as may be delegated by the Board. Whenever these policies assign specific ta sks to the committee, the policies assume that the actual work will (or may) be performed by the Idaho State University Foundation's Finance Director or other desi gnated staff members, subject only to the committee's overall supervision. Investment Consultant, Advisors, and Agents The committee is specifically authorized to retain one or more investment advisors (advisors) as well as any administrators, custodians, or other investment service providers required for t he proper management of the Idaho State University Foundation's funds. The committee may utilize an advisor as an investment consultant (consultant) to advise and assist the co mmittee in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities. In that regard, a consultant may help the committee to 1. Develop and maintain invest ment policy, asset allocation strategies, risk-based fund objectives, and appropriate invest ment management structures; 2. Select, monitor, and evaluate investment advisors and/or investment entities; 3. Provide and/or review quarterly perform ance measurement repor ts and assist the committee in interpreting the results; 4. Review portfolios and recommend actions, as needed, to maintain proper asset allocations and investment strategies for the objectives of each fund; and, 5. Execute such other duties as may be mutually agreed. In discharging this authority, the committee can act in the pl ace and stead of the board and may receive reports from, pay compensat ion to, enter into agreements with, and delegate discretionary invest ment authority to such advisors. When delegating discretionary investment authority to one or more advisors, the committee will establish and follow appropriate procedures for selecting such advisors and for conveying to each the scope of their authority, t he organization's expectations, and the requirement of full compliance with these policies. Objectives The Idaho State University Foundat ion's primary investment objec tive is to preserve and protect its assets by earning a total return for each category of assets (a \"fund\"), which is appropriate for each fund's time horizon, di stribution requirements, and risk tolerance. Tax-Based Restrictions The Idaho State University Foundation is a charitable organization under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Consequently, its in come is generally exempt from federal and state income tax with the exception of in come that constitutes unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). The committee is to determine if a particular strategy or investment will generate UBTI, for which it may rely on advice of counsel. Since UBTI can be generated by leveraged investments (re sulting in \"debt-financed income\"), the ATTACHMENT 2 AUDIT TAB 1-B Page 24 Policy VD Investments Page 3 Idaho State University Foundation will not ut ilize margin, short selling, or other leveraged investment strategies unless t he Investment Committ ee grants a specific exception. When granting ex ceptions, the committee must determine that the potential rewards outweigh the incremental risks and costs of UBTI. All such exceptions shall be made in writing and shall be communicated to the Board as part of the next regular Investment Committee report. Reporting Requirements 1. Monthly \u2014 The committee will obtain written m onthly custodial statements. Such statements should contain a ll pertinent transaction details for each account that holds all or a portion of any the Idaho State University Foundation investment funds. Each monthly stat ement should include - The name and quantity of each security purchased or sold, with the price and transaction date; and, - A description of each security holdi ng as of month-end, including its percentage of the total portfolio, purc hase date, quantity, average cost basis, current market value, unrealized gai n or loss, and indicated annual income (yield) at market. In addition, if not included in the custodi al reports, the consultant and/or the investment advisor(s) should provide a report for each fund or portfolio showing the month-end alloca tion of assets between equities, fixed-income securities, and cash. The monthly revi ew of custodial statements may be delegated to the Idaho State Univer sity Foundation accounting staff. 2. Quarterly \u2014 The committee should obtain from its investment consultant and/or investment advisors, a detailed review of the Idaho State University Foundation's investment performance for the preceding quarter and for longer trailing periods as appropriate. Such reports should be provided as to each fund and as to the Idaho State University Foundation investm ent assets in the aggregate. As to each fund, the committee should establish wi th its investment consultant and/or investment advisors the specific criter ia for monitoring ea ch fund's performance including the index or blend of indices t hat are appropriate fo r the objectives of each fund and for the investm ent style or asset class of each portfolio within a fund. The committee shall meet with the c onsultant to conduct such reviews to the extent it deems necessary. 3. Periodically \u2014 The committee should meet with its investment consultant at least annually to review all aspects of t he Idaho State University Foundation's investment assets. Such a review should include 1) strategic asset allocation, 2) manager and investment entit y performance, 3) anticipated additions to or withdrawals from funds, 4) fu ture investment strategies , and 5) any other matters of interest to the committee.

Page 3 BACKGROUND : On September 17, 1970, The University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. (Foundation) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho as a non- profit organization exempt from Federal tax under section 501(c)(3 ) of the Internal Revenue C ode. The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors. The Foundation's sole purpose is to support the University of Idaho (University) by the means at its di sposal with an emphasis on solic iting financial support for the University and managing and investing the securi ties, monies and real and personal property it receives from such sources, and to expend its re sources, beyond that requi red to cover the costs of its operation, to and for the benefit of the University. The University is governed by the Regents of The University of Idaho (Regents) and is a constitutional corporation organized and existi ng under and by virtue of the Constitution of the State of Idaho. The University is exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as an educational organization. The Consolidated Investment Trust (C.I.T.) wa s established by the Rege nts in July 1959, when the assets of 25 individual endowments ha ving a combined market value of $441,460 were pooled for investment purposes only and in return were issued unit participation shares in an investment account called the C.I.T. The purpose for creating the C.I.T. was to provide a well- managed, diversified investment ve hicle owned entirely by endowments. Effective July 1, 1975, the Regents transferred th e assets of the C.I.T. to the Foundation. Upon accepting the C.I.T., the Foundation Board of Directors established an Investment Committee and charged it with the responsibilit y of monitoring and guiding the C.I.T.'s investment policy. INVESTMENT POLICY: Introduction: The Foundation Investment Committee de veloped this policy through careful study and consideration of the retu rns and risks associated with al ternative investment strategies in relation to the current and projected income needs of University and Foundation activities which are supported by the endowments. The policy provides a structure w ithin which the funds may be managed to achieve the long term inve stment and financial obj ectives of all pooled endowment funds. The Foundation is committed to ensuring the assets of the pooled endowment funds are fully diversified and are managed effi ciently and prudently by qualified investment personnel. Because of the perpetual nature of endowment s, decisions with regard to investment management and performance of all pooled endowment funds must focus on long-term goals and objectives which safeguard endowment princi pal and maximize returns which support the education, research, and service missions of the University. ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 29Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 4 It is noted that the Foundation may accept and administer endowments and/or trusts which for various reasons are not invested in the C.I.T. or other pooled e ndowment funds. In those rare instances, the Investment Committee shall ensure the assets of said endowments/trusts are invested in a prudently and fiscally sound manner and are administered in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the individu al endowment/trust agreement which exists for each. Objectives: The specific objectives of all pooled endowment fund investments are to: 1. provide a regular and reliable source of funding to meet the goals and objectives of the endowments which own pooled endowmen t fund unit partic ipation shares, 2. target a long-term total rate of return that is, as a minimum, net of fees , at least five percent (5%) greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), 3. maintain or increase the purch asing power of the corpus af ter withdrawals are taken, and 4. keep in perspective the long-term (ten year or longer) in vestment objectives when evaluating interim fluctuations. Spending Policy: An endowment spending policy de termines how the endowment payout amount will be calculated, including how much of the tota l return will be distributed to support the purposes of the endowment and how much will be reinvested. It is the intent of the Investment Committee to achieve a balance between the endow ment growth objectives and stability in the annual investment revenue avai lable for spending in s upport of the specified purposes of the endowments which own unit pa rticipation shares. A spending policy in conjunction with the investment pol icy is intended to help achieve this balance thereby allowing greater predictability in allocation planning . C.I.T. Endowment Classes : The spending policy for each endowment is determined by the endowment agreement that exists for each endowment owning C.I.T. unit participation shares. There are two \"classes\" of endowments: 1. \"Old\" or \"Traditional\" Language: Most endowments that were created prior to 1996 stipulate that realized income is to be distributed and that all realized capital gains are to be reinvested as principal. Accordingly, the sp ending policy for these is to annually distribute all of the net realized income from dividends and interest to support activities and programs specified in the endowment agreements. Net real ized capital gains, unles s stated otherwise in the endowment agreements, are returned to the principal of the endowme nts and reinvested. The principal of all C.I.T. endowments is inviol ate. The C.I.T. distributions are made on a unit participation shar e pro-rata basis. 2. \"New\" or \"Flexible\" Language: Most endowment agreements written since 1996 and some of the older endowments include more flexible la nguage that allows for distributable earnings to be calculated in accordance with policy established by the Foundation's governing board. ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 30Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 5 In September 2000, the Foundation Board of Direct ors determined that a spending rate for \"new\" or \"flexible\" endowments will be established annually by the Foundation Board of Directors based upon the recommendation of the Investment Committee. The target spending rate, net of fees, will be four and a half per cent (4.5%) of the three-year rolling average fair market value of the C.I.T. Assessment for Administration and Investment Management Expenses : Each endowment participating in the C.I.T. will annually be asse ssed 75 basis points (.75%) of its three-year rolling average fair market value to pay for e xpenses associated with the administration and investment management of the C.I.T. Assessment for Foundation Operations : Each \"New\" or \"Flexible\" Language Endowment will annually be assessed 50 basis points (.50%) of its th ree-year rolling average fair market value to be allocated to the Foundation for expenses incl uding but not limited to operating costs and fund raising/development expenses. Investment Management Expenses: Investment management expenses will be paid from the following sources: 1) the 75 basis points assess ment described above; 2) revenues generated by commission recapture, and 3) temporary invest ment of realized investment earnings. Asset Allocation Guidelines: The asset allocation process include s: 1) the selection of asset categories, i.e., domestic and international equi ties, fixed-income funds , real estate, private equity, other alternative investments and cash and/ or cash equivalents; and 2) the percentage of the total portfolio for each asset category. Once the asset allocation has been determined by the Investment Committee, the selection of indivi dual investments within each class is the responsibility of the investment managers. The Investment Committee is responsible for determining strategic (long-term) asset allocation, which focuses on the optimal combination of asset classes that is consistent with the Foundation's risk-return preference and the time horizon. Asset allocation includes the establishment of ri sk tolerance and the maximization of the long- run productivity of the pooled endowment fund's portfolio. This determ ination, in conjunction with the spending policy, is the basis for balanc ing the investment policy to assure the growth and financial stability of th e endowment in perpetuity. The asset allocation as shown below will be re viewed at least annually by the Investment Committee, rebalanced, and repor ted to the Foundation Board.

The committee will communicate in formal cont racts the policy and performance expectations for each investment manager, and will review inve stment performance regularly to assure policy compliance. Performance will also be regular ly evaluated to judge investment managers. The Investment Committee is a standing committee of the Foundation. It generally meets three or four times a year with the staff from the University Trust and Investment Office (TIO). Membership of the Investment Committee shall be structured to assure investment acumen, continuity and opportun ities for service.

Additional committee members shall be appointed by the Foundation's Chairman and approved by the F oundation Board of Directors. The chairman of the committee shall be a ppointed by the Foundation's Chairman and approved by the Foundation Board of Directors . The primary responsibility of the Investment Committee is to oversee and provide guidance for the investment of Foundation assets. Its major responsibilities are: 1. Recommending investment goals and object ives to the Board of Directors. 2. Formulating investment policy (asset a llocation, spending policy, and level of risk). 3. Selecting and hiring investment manage rs and reviewing their performance. 4. Establishing performance measurement cr iteria for investment managers and the overall portfolio. 5.

The TIO has the responsibility to comply with: applicable state and fede ral laws and regulations; Regents' regulations and require ments; University of Idaho policies and procedures; donor requirements; generally accepted accounting a nd financial management principles; the Foundation's Articles of Incorpora tion and the Foundation's by-laws. Specifically with regard to the investment responsibilitie s, the TIO will oversee the administration and support of those functions es sential to sound financial management of all Foundation funds, including pool ed endowment funds, such as fiscal planning, budgeting, receipting and disbursing of funds, and invest ing/managing assets to include custodial and accounting functions. The Foundation Board of Directors shall aut horize specific indivi dual(s) to endorse securities/stock or bond powers for sale, transfer, merger or other lawful purposes and to open or close brokerage accounts and accounts with co mmercial banks, as necessary to implement investment decisions and transa ct business in the name of a nd on behalf of the Foundation. The TIO will, under the direction of the Investment Committee, provide and/or arrange for the following services: conducting se lection processes for investment management; review, assess, and present to the Investment Committee analysis data about investment performance; analyze and present discussion agendas re garding modifications to the investment policy, especially the allocation matrix and spending policy; negotiate the management fee structure; and provide desired accounting and reporting to the Inve stment Committee and Foundation Board of Directors. Investment Managers: The pooled endowment funds will be managed by qualified investment management personnel/investment management or ganizations. The investment managers have discretion, within the guidelines set forth in this investment po licy statement and any additional guidelines provided each manager, to manage the assets in each portfolio to best achieve the investment objectives established by the Investme nt Committee. The investment managers shall be responsible for determining investment stra tegy and implementing security selection and the timing of purchases and sales with in the policy guidelines set forth in this statement and as otherwise provided by the Investment Committee. Each investment manager will be provided a copy of this statement of investment policy. In turn, as part of the investment management contract that will govern the allocated portfolio, each investment manager is to be provided a writ ten statement of the Foundation's expectations, stated in terms of the objectives and comparativ e benchmarks that will be used to evaluate performance and the allowable investment vehicles that can be used to achieve these objectives. ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 34Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 9 Investment Managers - General Guidelines: These guidelines shall apply to all investment managers, unless addressed otherwise in individual management contracts. Parameters: 1. All managers shall have discretion to invest in cash reserves; however, managers will be evaluated on total funds investment performance. 2. Cash and short-term instruments maturing in le ss than 360 days shall be restricted to a maximum of 10% of total assets except fo r brief periods and for temporary defensive purposes. 3. Mutual funds and other pooled asset portfolios are accepta ble investment vehicles provided they conform to all othe r requirements and restrictions. 4. US equity holdings shall be restricted to r eadily marketable securi ties of corporations that are actively traded on the major US exchanges including National Market System Stocks. US equity holdings may include American Depository Receipts traded on US Exchanges. Preferred and convertible prefer red stocks may be held. Publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) shares may be held and are considered part of the allocation to stocks. Th ere is no minimum market capit alization for holdings of individual issues. However, each holding shall be of sufficiently low percentage of average daily trading volume to ensure sa le on favorable terms at the appropriate time. 5. At least 75% of all non-US e quity holdings shall be highl y liquid securities issued by corporations headquartered in countries included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Austra lia, Far East Index and Cana da. Up to 25% of non-US equity holdings may be issues purchased and sold on exchanges in other countries that offer a ready market for individual issu es and have no restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from the US. Mana gers holding non-US dollar denominated securities are permitted to employ currency hedging strategies. 6. Fixed income investments shall be market able securities which may include, but not necessarily be limited to US Treasury, federal agenci es and US Government guaranteed obligations, sovereign debt, a nd domestic and foreign corporate issues including convertibles. Mort gage pass-throughs and collat eralized debt obligations may be held. Quality preferred stock issu ed by domestic corporations may also be held. The overall rating of the fixed income assets will be at least \"A\" as measured by a nationally recognized rating agency. In cases where the yield spread adequately compensates for additional risk, BAA or BBB and below and non-rated securities may be purchased. However, no more than 30% of the holdings shall be in securities whose credit rating is less than BAA- or BBB-. ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 35Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 10 7. Cash equivalent reserves sh all consist of cash instrume nts having a quality rating by at least one rating agency of A-2, P-2 or higher, maturing in 360 days or less. 8. The following securities and transactions ar e not authorized: le tter stock and other unregistered equity securities; commodities or commodity contracts; short sales or margin transactions. 9. Financial options and futures may be employed in defensive and hedge strategies undertaken to preserve principal. 10. An investment manager shall not use derivativ es to increase portfolio risk above the level that could be achieve d in the portfolio using onl y traditional investment securities. Moreover, an investment ma nager will not use derivatives to acquire exposure to changes in the value of assets or indexes that, by themselves, would not be purchased for the portfolio. Under no circumstances will an investment manager undertake an investment that is non-covered or leveraged to the extent that it would cause portfolio duration to exceed normal duration limits. Investment in \"exotic\" derivatives with unstable durations is prohi bited. PO's, . Conventional classes of CMO's are allowed. Diversification: Investments sha ll be diversified with the intent to minimize the risk of large realized and unrealized losses to the invested assets. Consequen tly, the total portfolio will be constructed and maintained to provide prudent dive rsification with regard to the concentration of holding in individual issues, co rporations, or industries. 1. Not more than 5% of the total equity portfo lio valued at market may be invested in the common stock of any one corporation. 2. Not more than 5% of the total outstanding shares of any one company may be held. 3. Not more than 20% of the equ ity portfolio valued at market may be held in any one industry category. 4. Fixed income securities of any one issuer shall not exceed 5% of the market value of the total bond portfolio at the time of th e purchase (except US Treasury or other federal agency issues). 5. Holdings of any individual fixed income i ssue must not exceed 5% of the value of the total issue (except US Treasury or other federal agency issues). Volatility: Consistent with the de sire for adequate diversificati on, the investment policy is based on the assumption that the volatility of the combined equity portfolios will be similar to that of the market opportunity available to institutional i nvestors with similar return objectives. Fixed income portfolio durations may exceed that of the market even though the volatility of fixed income portfolios, under these conditi ons, may be greater than the market. ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 36Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 11 Voting of Proxies: The Investment Managers shall vote sharehol der proxy ballots. Execution of Security Trades: The Investment Committee expects the purchase and sale of securities by investment managers to be made in a manner designed to receive the combination of best price and execution. MONITORING AND EVALUATION: Overall Portfolio: This will entail a review of th e investment objectives. Investment performance will be reviewed a nnually to determine the continue d feasibility of achieving the investment objectives and the appropriateness of the investment policy for achieving these objectives. It is not expected that the inve stment policy will change frequen tly. In particular, short-term changes in the financial markets should not requi re any adjustment in the investment policy. Managers: The TIO will provide monthly investme nt activity reports to the Investment Committee, including a breakdown by each invest ment manager. The Investment Committee shall meet on a periodic basi s with the Foundation's investment advisory consultant and TIO staff to review total assets and individual manager performance. Performance reviews will focus on: 1. Comparison of managers' results to funds using similar policies (in terms of diversification, volatility, style, etc.). 2. Manager and total asse ts adherence to th e policy guidelines. 3. Material changes in the manager organizati ons, such as investment philosophy, personnel changes, acquisitions or lo sses of major accounts, etc. 4. Evaluate performance on a minimum rolling thre e to five-year investment horizon to judge interim fluctuations with an appropriate perspective. 5. Evaluate performance relative to performance benc hmarks that realistically reflect the market of each investment portfolio. The Investment Managers shall keep the Invest ment Committee advised of any material changes in personnel, investment strategy, or other pertinent information potentially affecting performance of all managers. Performance Expectations: The most important performance expectation is the achievement of long-term investment results that are consistent with this Investment Policy Statement. The C.I.T. will be compared to a blended benchmark th at represents the target asset classes. The ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 37Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 12 C.I.T. is expected to meet or exceed the pa ssive policy benchmark over a majority of rolling three- and five-year periods. Implementation of th e policy will be directed toward achieving this return and not toward maximizing re turn without considering the risk. The Investment Committee recognizes that this real return objective may not be meaningful during some time periods. In order to ensure that investment opportunities available over a specific time period are fairly evaluated, compar ative performance statistics will be used to evaluate investment results. The Investment Co mmittee expects each manager to meet or exceed their passive index and the median of their respective performan ce evaluation universe. This performance should be achieved over a major ity of rolling three to five year periods. ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING In addition to retaining competent investment managers, essential elem ents of a successful portfolio include proper accounting, investment activity reporting, performance reporting and internal activity reporting. These functions ar e provided to the Foundation by financial systems and personnel of the TIO. Annual Audit: 1. The accounting records for the pooled endowment funds will be maintained in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles a nd reporting standards, and will be audited annually by the same independent external a uditors who audit the Foundation's financial statements. 2. The annual audited financial statements and auditor's letter to management will be presented at the Foundation's annual meeting. 3. The internal controls utilized by the Foundation will be adapted to meet the needs of all pooled endowment funds and will be routinely reviewed by external auditors for appropriateness. Investment Pool: 1. Endowments which own pooled endowment fund unit participation shares will be separately accounted for -- ea ch will have their own sepa rate fund identification and subaccounts which detail uninve sted cash, fund balance invest ed in a pooled endowment fund, and total fund balance. 2. Endowments which have cash available for inve sting in a pooled endow ment fund will be allowed to purchase unit participation shares at their fair market value on the first day of each month. ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 38Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 13 3. The fair market value of a unit participation share will be determined as of the close of business on the last working day of each mont h. The share value will be determined by valuing the pooled endowment fund 's portfolio at market and dividing that market value by the number of permanent unit participation shares outstanding. 4. The pooled endowment fund's annual spending distributions will be made based on the number of distribution unit particip ation shares owned by each endowment. 5. The TIO will ensure idle cash is fully invested until needed for distributions at year end, and for transfer to a pooled endowment fr om individual endowments to purchase unit participation shares. 6. The TIO will receive all broker/custodial confirma tions for purchases and sales of securities and ensure that (1) purchases are paid in a ti mely manner, (2) sales proceeds are received and immediately deposited in a Foundation brokerage/custodial or bank account and invested, (3) the financial records properly refl ect all purchases and sa les, and (4) sales and purchase commissions are reasonable. Investment Management: 1. The TIO will monitor investment activity and de termine whether or not current established portfolio investment parameters are being followed. 2. The TIO will receive monthly broker/custodial statements and reconcile detail shown thereon to the financial and investment records. 3. The TIO will receipt all interest and dividend checks and ensure they are (1) the proper amount, (2) properly recorded on the financial records, and (3) promptly deposited in a Foundation brokerage or bank account. 4. The TIO will maintain a detailed schedule of in vestments to ensure that all dividends and interest are, in fact , received when due, and that the ex act location of all investments is known at all times. 5. The TIO will ensure accurate and timely invest ment data is submitted to an independent funds evaluation firm so that firm can prepare investment performance reports. 6. The TIO will ensure that accurate and timely I nvestment Activity Reports are prepared for use by Investment Managers, Investment Committee and others. 7. The TIO will prepare accurate and timely m onthly valuations of the pooled endowment fund portfolios and calcula te the value of a unit participation share. 8. The TIO will ensure that endowments which have cash available for the purchase of pooled endowment fund unit participation shares have that cash transferre d to the appropriate ATTACHMENT 3 AUDIT TAB 1-C Page 39Statement of Investment Policy and Management University of Idaho Foundation, Inc. Page 14 pooled endowment fund in a timely manner, and that the investment manager is aware of the amount of new money available for investment. 9.

D. Addressing a Conflict of Interest. If a conflict of interest is determined to exist, then the board or committee shall: 1. Require the interested person to leave th e meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement that results in the conflict of interest; provided, however, that the interested person may make a presentation at the meeting prior to leaving; 2. Appoint, if it deems appropriate, a non-interested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the propos ed transaction or arrangement; and 3. Determine, by a majority vote without the interested person voting, that the transaction or arrangement is in the F oundation's best interests and for its own benefit; is fair and reasonable to the Foundation, and, after exercising due diligence, determine that the Foundatio n cannot obtain a more advantageous transaction or arrangement with reas onable efforts under the circumstances.

Prior language would allow coach to take lesser employment and continue to receive full termination payment. Language also requires Coach to inform University of the terms of any new employment so University can accurately determine the compensation, if any, to which Coach is entitled.

BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION The agencies and instituti ons noted below received legislative carryover spending authority. FY 2009 appropriation bills for the College and Univer sities (HB610), Health Programs Education ( SB1474 and HB687). The institutions and agencies request approval to carry over authorized but unspent funds from FY 2008, to be expended in FY 2009. Board Policy V.C.1.b(2) states \"Certain special acco unt monies, such as direct federal appropriations, state endowment income and trust accounts, and miscellaneous receipts, are the subject of continuing or perpetual spending authority.\" Board Policy V. C.1.d states \"...the instit utions, school and agencies under the governance of the Board must not expend, encumbe r, or otherwise use monies under their direct control with out the specific or general approval by the State Board of Educat ion or the Board of Regents of the University of Idaho...\" The ability to carry over funds from one fisc al year to another is very valuable in managing institution or agency budget planning ac ross fiscal years. Expenditures can be strategically planned instead of attempting to spend all funds by the end of a particular fiscal y ear. The instituti ons and agencies have identified the funds available to be carried over and the plan ned expenditure of these funds. Since carry over revenues are one-time, the expenditures must be limited to one-time items. IMPACT Approval will authorize an increase in sp ending authority for FY 2009 so the institutions and agencies can expend th e funds. These expe nditure plans are included in the FY 2009 inst itutional operating budgets. STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Staff has reviewed the information provi ded by the institutions, and recommends approval of carryover s pending authority, as aut horized by legislative appropriation.

BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION Board policy regarding capital project re visions has not been clear in determining when an institution or agency ne eds to get Board approval. Current policy requires that re visions that substantially al ter the use of the project causing changes in project costs betw een $250,000 and $500,000 must first be submitted to the executive director for review and approval. Changes in project costs of more than $500,000 must be submi tted to the Board for its review and approval. There has been some confusion over whether the threshold referred to each incremental change or to the aggregate total project cost. At its August meeting, t he Board reviewed a similar po licy revision that included the decision grid on pages 5 and 10 and in creased the approval authority for the local government from $250,000 to $500,0 00 and for the Executive Director from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The Board disappro ved this revision citing concern for increasing the dollar thresholds, but they considered the grid helpful. This policy revision includes the decision grid but does not change the dollar thresholds.

Litigation REFERENCE August 2008 Board approved first reading APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governi ng Policies & Procedures, Section V.I.7. BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION The proposed policy clearly defines the repo rting procedures to the Board for all claims, potential claims, and litigation matters. The Board approved the first reading at t he August Board meeting. The only changes in this second reading is clarifyi ng language in section 3 to indicate monthly reports are attorney-client privileged. No other comments were received. IMPACT The attached policy will increase the th reshold for Chief Executive Officer approval, allow for Executiv e Director approval up $2 50,000 and increase the threshold requiring Board approval to amounts over $250,000. This should decrease the number of agenda items s ubmitted to the Board for under $250,000, allowing for quicker re solution. It also would permit the institution to initiate litigation without prior B oard approval up to these thresholds.

BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 1 SUBJECT Differential Fees REFERENCE February 2001 President's Council report on need for differential fees May 2001 Included in strategic planning discussion APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Govern ing Policies & Procedures, Section V.R.3.b. BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION The college and universities request the Board to consider amending policy V.R.3.b. to allow institut ions to request Board approval to establish Differential Fees in the future. While most other stat es do allow for some form of differential fee, Idaho's Board policies do not include a provision that would allow institutions to seek these types of fees. By insert ing this definition of differential fees, institutions would be able to r equest such fees in the future. Differential fees may be higher or lowe r than base tuition and fees and apply to all academic programs in a college or school. Higher fees may be charged by a college or school that incurs markedl y higher than average expenditures for faculty or equipment and that lead to employment possibilities that are demonstrably worth the higher price. Lower fees may be charged where costs of delivery are consistently and substantially below average for the institution. Differential fees differ from Board approved professional fees. Professional fees include credentialing and accreditation re quirements as well as extraordinary program costs. IMPACT The proposed policy envisions higher differ ential fees which wo uld substantially increase the quality of the learning ex perience for the student and provide a basis for later opportunities that would not be possible without the differential increase. The institution would be requi red to allow for access to qualified students who cannot afford t he differential amount by including a financial aid plan with a minimum percentage of the fees set aside for need-based aid. The aid plan would also include an advisin g process that enables students to anticipate future cost increases and seek additional aid to cover the fee increase. The differential fee plan would include a cl ear justification related to the variance in cost for the college or school com pared to the funds that would be provided through base tuition and fees. Evidence sh ould exist that the differential fee plan is comparable to the student cost for simila r programs at peer inst itutions so that BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 2 the institution is not dis advantaged in attracting students . Finally, the plan should show evidence of consultation with affected students both through student representative groups and organized opinion gathering among students. STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The institutions are requesting direction fr om the Board whether there is support for a mechanism to request differential fees by the college or universities. BOARD ACTION A motion to direct staff to bring forw ard an amendment to Board Policy V.R.3. adding differential fees.

(Foundat ion) for an office building located at 220 Park Center Boul evard in Boise, property the Foundation purchased from Supervalu for universit y use. The University and Foundation executed the lease on August 8, 2008. Si nce that time, the Foundation, in consultation with the University, has elected to finance the purchase of the property using tax-exempt bond financing. The cash portion of the purchase pric e of the property is $7 million. The Foundation received a multi-year pledge of $5 million, payable in annual payments of $1 million. T he Foundation has received the first of five pledged payments. On September 2, 2008 the Foundation obtained a short-term (45 days) loan in the amount of $5,936,882 at a variable rate of 5% to purchase the property. The Foundation will refinance t hat loan with tax-exempt bond financing bearing an interest rate of 4.86% no la ter than October 17, 2008. The Foundation expects to receive the next pledge paym ent in mid-September , and will apply that pledge to the refinancing so that t he total bond financing amount does not exceed $5.2 million. IMPACT Tax-exempt bond financing creates use rest rictions on the property, restrictions the University understands and must comply with in its own tax-exempt bond financed properties.

In 2002, the University init iated a multi-year process for design of the Education and Performance Facility at the Lionel Hamp ton Center using a series of federal HUD grants awarded from 2001 through 2004. The project was to include music performance spaces, music classrooms , as well as archival and display spaces for jazz memorabilia of the Lionel Hampton Jazz Collectio n. In 2004, the University placed the project on hold, and later cancelled the project due to a number of factors, including lack of progress in priv ate fundraising required to support the project. The University reconceptualized project elements and most recently sought to renovate an existing music performance s pace, the Recital Ha ll within the Music Building, as well archival space in the Li brary. The Board granted authorization for these projects at the June 2008 meet ing, subject to federal support for realigning the grant fundi ng. The University has since received guidance from HUD, limiting grant expenditures to only the Music Building. The University now seeks to further adjust the project to co mply with HUD limitations. The project outlined below has been presented to and endorsed by HUD. The Lionel Hampton School of Music (LHS OM) Building was orig inally built in 1951 and has had only minor im provements implemented in the 57 years since. The series of HUD grants available for t he project total $1,590,686 and will fund a limited, phased expansion and renovati on/rehabilitation of the existing structure. The University envisions a three-phased approach to renovate and expand the building. Per HUD limitations , construction expenditures are limited to only $596,586, which will fund a portion of the reno vations anticipated within the Recital Hall. The remaining $994, 100 can be used only to cover planning, design, and owner/administrative costs associated with all three phases of the BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 6 Page 2 project. The overall project element s and estimated costs are summarized below. Available HUD f unding will serve only a portion of these needs; the remaining needs will be target ed for private fundraising. Phase 1 includes renovation of the existi ng Recital Hall; Phase 2 will be the construction of a 10,000 s quare foot building addition; Phase 3 will include the renovation/rehabilitation of the remain ing 25,000 square feet of the existing facility. Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 A/E Design 190,000 400,000 550,000 Construction 1,528,000 3,050,000 $3,500,000 $5,000,000 Further explanation of the work of each phase follows. The building includes a Recital Hall which seats almost 400 people. It is the site of many community performances and is the main performance space for the Lionel Hampton School of Music students and faculty. As such, the Recital Hall is the teaching laboratory for the LHSO M. During the annual Lionel Hampton International Jazz Festival, the Recital Hall is in use from dawn to dusk. The Hall is used every day throughout the academi c year for classes, rehearsals, and performances. There are over 150 full conc erts in the Recital Hall each year. The Hall is located in the middle of the building, a bove other classroom space, and adjacent to various faculty offices and labs. Due to poor acoustical separation, there is signifi cant sound transmission both into and out of the Recital Hall, negatively impacting recital and concer t events, as well as activities in adjacent spaces. The School of Music mu st carefully schedule activities in the Hall and nearby classrooms, due to the lack of acoustical separation. The priority needs to be met in this firs t phase of construction include resolution of the acoustical challenges in the building as well installation of updated seating, handicap seating, new floor coveri ngs, and lighting enhancements. Later phases of the project will serve to enhance teaching and learning spaces supporting music education at the unive rsity, to include construction and renovation of classrooms, production preparation and stor age facilities, rehearsal spaces, loading dock, instrument storage, props shop, offices, and storage; technical facilities and equipment incl uding stage equipment, lighting equipment, music equipment, sound system, video s ystem, and communication systems; public areas, box office, food and bever age areas, restrooms, and administrative office areas.

Cu mmings Research, Education & Extension Center, Salmon, Idaho REFERENCE October 2006 Initial Capital Proj ect Authorization for Planning, Design and Construction Implementation. Regular Board Meeting, October, 2006 June 2008 Included in the C apital Improvement Budget Summary Submitted at the Regular Board Meeting, June, 2008 August 2008 Presented for Additi onal Project Authorization for Planning, Design and Cons truction Implementation. Regular Board M eeting, August, 2008 APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governi ng Policies & Procedure, Section, V.K.1 & V.K.2 BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION This is a request for additional Regents Authorization to design and construct a Residential Facility to be located at the UI Nancy M. Cummings Research, Education & Extension C enter, Salmon, Idaho. This project and request for additional Re gents Authorization was presented at the August, 2008 Regular Meet ing of the Board of Regent s. At that time the Request was held in abeyance, and the Board requested that the University bring the request back before the Board at the October, 2008 Regular Meeting with a justification for the increase and the high cost per square foot. Project History: In October 2006, the University of Idaho, College of Agricu ltural and Life Sciences (CALS), requested authorizat ion to plan, design and construct a residential (dormitory) facility at the Na ncy M. Cummings Research, Education & Extension Center located on approximately 1,025 acre s of real property in Salmon, Idaho. This property was gifted to the University of Idaho with the agreement that the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences would promote research, economic development and educati onal opportunities for the residents of Lemhi and surroun ding counties, and secondarily to the state of Idaho, the nation and the world. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 2 The Initial Regents Authoriz ation level was set at $1,500,000 for the project during the October, 2006 Regular Board meeting. It is important to note that this number was based upon budgetary targets; no design work had been completed at that time. In the materi als submitted to the Board at that time, the University noted that the overal l project cost estimate will be refined and improved as part of this planning process. The University further pledged to repor t back to the Board of Regents any resulting revisions to t he project estimate and seek additional project authorization as may be required. As the project design progre ssed, the Design Team cons isting of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Idaho Facilities and the Design West Architects and their consulting team wo rked to keep the project in budget. The period from 2006 to 2008 is one in which the constructi on industry as a whole experienced significant cost escalati ons in commodities such as metals, concrete, and fossil fuels. Rapidly escala ting costs in these areas fueled cost adjustments in materials across the boar d. Several cost estimates were performed at key design phase milestones . The design team met numerous times to examine scope, perform val ue engineering exercises and look for methods to keep costs estimates withi n reason in an envir onment of rapid escalation. The project was reported to the Regent s in the annual Capital Improvement Budget Summary as submitt ed at the June, 2008 meeting at a total project cost of $1,800,000. This figure wa s based upon the results of the most recent cost estimate, performed in late April, 2008. Th e Architect also verified this estimate by requesting a review to the Constructi on documents and the estimate from two, separate General Contractors. The design phase for the project was comp leted in June, 2008 and the University publicly opened bids in July of 2008. The university received six competitive bids: Bidder Location Total Bid (Base + Alternates) Bateman Hall Idaho Falls $1,896,000 W.R.Henderson Rexburg $2,259,980 Commercial General Idaho Falls $1,812,100 Rivers West Idaho Falls $2,200,500 Ovard Idaho Falls $2,134,500 Harris General Pocatello $1,880,000 Based upon the bids received, the total pr oject cost - to include all A/E fees, geotechnical engineering fees, plan check and construction materials testing fees, fixtures and furnishings for a comp lete and functional facility, and prudent construction and project contingencies, et c. - for the effort is now $2,213,410. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 3 The apparent low bid results in a total pr oject cost increase of approximately 23% more than the total project cost based upon the April 2008 design phase milestone estimate as reported in June , 2008, and an increas e of approximately 47% over the initial esti mates in October, 2006. Upon receipt of the bids, the design t eam met to evaluate the bids, and re- evaluate the scope. The College of Agricult ural and Life Sciences confirmed that the scope of the project was the correct scope in support of the programmatic goals and requirements for the facility. Further, the fact t hat six bids were received, and that the bottom three bids were within 4% of each other, indicates that a fair, market value pr ice had been bid for the scope. As a result of that session, and subseq uent sessions on the same topic, the University believes the cost escalation in the Total Project Budget can be best ascribed to: The period October 2006 to July 2008 was one in which the construction industry as a whole saw rapid escalati on in commodity materials such as concrete, asphaltic-based products and metals - with corresponding costs adjustments in other materials and items - between 10% to 15% per annum. Nearly two years of escalation at those rates, compounded, accounts for 21% to 33% escalation. Furnishings beyond Insta lled Equipment were not originally accounted for within the Project Budget. They are now included - along with an associated design fee for their iden tification and specification. A nominal amount, approximat ely $29,000, was added to the administrative fees to cover additiona l design team services related to achieving LEED Certified status in response to adopted University Policy. Conversations with bidders both before and after the bid lead the University to the conclusion that the aspiration to attain LEED Certified status is cost neutral in terms of the bid, construction costs. Design process decisions during the De sign Phase related to a level of fit and finish in keeping with the import this facility has within Beef Industry in the State of Idaho and the Pacific No rthwest. The facility is to house research and industry representatives from Idaho, Wash ington, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, etc. T he facility needs to have a basic level of quality in accordance with the programmatic mission. The facility is not extravagant by any means of measure, however, t he facility as designed and bid is not a bare, exposed structure. Conversations with bidders prior to t he bid led the University to believe that at least one local, Salmon, Idaho, Contractor would bid the project as a General Contractor. We believed th is bidder would have a comparative advantage. In the end, there we re no local bidders as General Contractors. The remote location. Given no loca l bidders, the lo cation in Salmon causes an increase in transportation costs. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 4 The 23% increase from final, pre-bid es timate in late April of 2008 to June of 2008 matches nearly identically an approximate 21% increase in fuel prices over the same period of time . This sudden and rapid escalation in fuel prices likely contributed to an over all context of unce rtainty. Couple that uncertainty with the remote location and it is a very logical conclusion that the pricing likely reflects a hi gher degree of bid contingency on the part of the General Cont ractors than might normally be the case. Given that the bottom three bidders fall into a tight range, this appears to be an accurate reflection of the market forces at work. The College of Agricultural and Life Sciences therefore identified requisite funding to allow the awar d to proceed. Sources of Funding: Funding sources are from College of Agricu ltural and Life Sciences reserves. These reserves have been accumulated during the past four years to address strategic initiatives identified by CALS Leadership, once the decision was made by President White to accept the gi ft from the Auen Fo undation in 2004. Because the facility costs were more than anticipated, the CALS administration will have to further realig n funding sources to addres s faculty startup packages, deferred maintenance, equipment purchas es, and other capital projects. Programmatic Goals and Ob jectives of the Project: The Nancy M. Cummings Research Education and Ext ension Center (NMCREEC) is dedicated to the study and teaching of sustai nable, integrated forage-based beef production and associat ed environmental interactions. University of Idaho faculty and staff affiliated with the Ce nter promote the understanding and practice of meeting both beef production and environmental goals through collaborative research pr ograms, and delivery of resulting educational information to K - 12, undergr aduate and graduate st udents as well as diverse groups in the Salmon Riv er region and the state of Idaho. Goals of the project include: 1. NMCREEC is a premier Center in t he Western United States for the study and teaching of sustainable, integrat ed, forage-based beef production and associated environmental interactions. 2. NMCREEC is a community-based re source for enhancing education for the Salmon River region, t he state, nation and world. 3. NMCREEC is a Center focused on a collaborative relationship between production and environmental goals. This living/conference facility is instrum ental in meeting the infrastructural needs at NMCREEC to meet these programmatic goal s. As a component in addition to the land and water resource base of NMCREEC, this stru cture will facilitate increased educational and diverse activiti es including Youth/4H/FFA, adult and BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 5 continuing education, undergraduate internships, graduate research and education, industry-related research and programmatic needs (Idaho Cattle Association, Idaho Beef Council, etc), and cultural/educational/industry needs of the City of Salmon and the Salmon River Valley Region, and associated federal (BLM) agencies. The project is supported and endorsed by the organizations mentioned above. It is a critical facility in developing the links and synergies between industry, research and educational stakeholders associated with forage-based beef production. Summary: This request for additional authorization is based upon the bids received and will allow the University to proceed. As the bids received in July, 2008 have now expired, there is the potent ial that the university will need to rebid the project. The project includes planni ng, pre-design, design, bi d, award and construction phase activities necessary to construc t a new building of approximately 7,430 GSF, complete. The facility as designed features 16 dormitory rooms for faculty, staff, students, administr ative personnel and constituent groups, a family sleeping room, a large assembly space for conferences and community outreach events, restrooms, kitchen, laundry and anc illary spaces. The project includes all systems and appurtenances necessary for a complete and functional installation. The project is fully consistent with the university's strategi c plan and its goals related to research, ex tension and outreach. IMPACT Immediate fiscal impact of th is effort is $2,213,410.

Although the recent events in the financial markets may have a positive effect on construction costs in the near future, the University believes similar cost reductions may not be realized in singul ar, on their own, remote projects - especially for projects schedul ed for the fall and winter. As noted by the University, due to t he increase in costs the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences will have to reallocate funding sources to address faculty startup packages, deferred maint enance, equipment pur chases, and other capital projects.

BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION University of Idaho Housing provides campus living options for both single graduate students and graduate st udent families. Univer sity housing has the capacity to accommodate 242 graduate student families in four unique communities: South Hill, South Hill Vi sta, Elmwood, and Graduate Student Residences. South Hill apartments were built beginning in 1972 and continued through 1985. The buildings were designe d to be 25-30 year buildings. Currently, of the 132 apartments available in South Hill only 75 are habitable. The remaining 57 apartments have been closed due to mold , excessive deferred maintenance, or water mitigation issues. Thirty six years after the first building opened, there is a need to address the poor condition of thes e buildings. The university estimates a total of $75 million in deferred maint enance needs in the South Hill Complex. Graduate family housing is generally at fu ll capacity, having to turn students away. The Long Range Campus Devel opment Plan (2000 upd ate added to the 2001 Strategic Plan) dedicates a portion of the space along Sweet Avenue as future housing, academic and parking sites. The envisioned potential project to redevelop South Hill, could in clude new development in a portion of this space. Any such development would not affect the academic portion of the footprint; there are no immediate plans to build or bond in the academic area. In studying strategies to redevelop S outh Hill, departmental leadership has found it to be financially infeasible to interna lly fund and construct new facilities without adding costs to all residents of housin g (beyond South Hill). The university recognizes the need to improve existi ng housing and create additional housing without issuing additional debt or using central cash reserves due to competing facility demands and limited debt capacity . An alternative is to explore collaboration with a private entity to replace these aging facilities, in a manner such that the collaboration would not affect the university's debt capacity. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 8 Page 2 The university plans to explore the pot ential for a collaborative public-private housing development for graduat e student housing. As a first step, the university will issue a request for information and qua lifications (RFIQ) to identify the market interest and abilities. Working with a private housing development entity could allow t he university to quickly modernize housing inventory, offer creative approaches to housing dilemmas, and meet student nee ds without increasing the debt of the University. In addition, new development would provide opportunities to design facilities that better meet occupancy demands an d student needs. A public-private development would allow the universit y to transfer construction risk and obligations to the private developer, while freeing up exis ting university funds to use for other needs. By addressing Sout h Hill through new construction using funding by an outside in vestor, University Housing woul d not have to continue to invest its own monies into clearly failing facilities but invest toward other Housing deferred maintenance projects. IMPACT The large renovation backl og and high existing debt service has created significant obstacles to renovation and upgr ading the existing housi ng inventory. The university intends to use this RFIQ process to identify the potential for alternative creative solutions to curr ent and future housing needs. This presentation is to provide an overview; any project will be presented separately for Board action as required by Board policy.

December 2004 Board asked for needs analysis and competitive RFP. January 2005 Board asked LCSC to explore possibility of private enterprise building new residence halls, and/or advantages of self-financ ing without a lease. March 2005 Board approved sale of tax-exempt bonds to fund the construction of a residence hall; however, at Board request, LCSC promised to postpone action until private firms had time to develop proposals. October 2005 After LCSC was c ontacted by two firms (each proposing to fund and build a residence hall), the Board approved the sale of lots to provide land for private development of (Co llege Place) residence hall. June 2006 Board approv ed management agreem ent for the first of two privately-developed residence halls (College Place) located adjacent to Campus on 4 th St. November 2006 Board approved management agreement for the second of two-privately developed residence halls (Clearwater Hall) locat ed in downtown Lewiston. April 2008 Board authorized LCSC to make offer to purchase residential portion of Clearwater Hall. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Educat ion Governing Policies & Pr ocedures, Sections V.I.1. through V.I.2. BACKGROUND / DISCUSSION The builders and current owners [Colle ge Town Development Idaho (CTDI)] of Clearwater Hall (the new residence facili ty which opened for operations in August 2006) on Main Street in dow ntown Lewiston, have ask ed LCSC to purchase the residential portion of the property. The investors in this private development project incurred operating losses as a resu lt of not having been able to lease the commercial space on the street level of the facility and lower-than-expected revenues for the residential portion of the facility. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 2 CTDI's investors assumed that commerc ial space on the ground floor of the building would be leased out almost continuously, generating revenues of over $120,000 per year, and that the 117 bed spac es in the residence hall portion of the building would be full 12 months eac h year. In the two years since the building opened, no tenants have been placed in the commercial space, and occupancy rate in the upstairs residential units averaged less than 80% over the Fall and Spring semesters. These lo wer-than-expected occ upancy rates were due to a combination of factors including: 1) Problems with missing or non-func tioning equipment/services when the facility opened for its first year of operation, and; 2) The simultaneous addition of two new residence halls (College Place and Clearwater Hall) which creat ed temporary overcapacity (an instantaneous increase of approximately 200 bed s). [This temporary housing glut was unanticipated\u2014the Co llege had experienced significant housing shortages in the 3-year period prior to the opening of the two new privately-developed hall s\u2014a period in which dozens of spillover students were housed each year under contract at the local Red Lion hotel.] LCSC's current management agreement with the owners has limited the College's exposure to financial risk for fa cility operations. LCSC foregoes a small management fee when occupancy rates dr op below 85%, while the owners bear the financial risk in the event commercia l space and residential space revenues are lower than anticipated. Because of near-term cash flow problems and difficulties securing long-term financing, the investors are s eeking to sell the property. In January 2008, after the owners urged LCSC to purchase the facility, the College analyzed the potential costs and b enefits of assuming direct ownership of the residential space. LCSC sugges ted that, based on an analysis of the value of the property based on revenues/cos ts that the Coll ege would incur, a ballpark figure of between $3.8M and $3. 9M would be the likely maximum amount that institution and it s Board of Trustees would likely be able to offer (significantly less than the $5.2M the owners' believed the College could and should pay for the facility. After addi tional discussion/analysis, the owners agreed to consider LCSC taking a $3.8M to $3.9M proposal to the State Board. On April 17, 2008, the Stat e Board authorized LCSC to make an offer of $3.8M\u2014 or the appraised value of the property (an appraisal was st ill underway at the time of the April Board meeti ng)\u2014whichever was lower. LCSC's appraisal for the property, receiv ed in mid-July 2008, estimated that the \"as is\" commercial value of the property to another potential investor was $2.8M (a weighted average of a $2.48M \"inc ome approach\" value, a and a $3.745M \"cost approach\" value). BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 3 In accordance with the Board's guidanc e in its April 2008 decision, LCSC subsequently offered (Atch 2) CTDI $2. 8M for the residential portion of the facility. CTDI rejected LCSC's offe r, and argued that the College's appraisal of the property reflected the va lue another out side business would be willing to pay for the facility to take CTDI's place and work with LCSC under the current arrangements and past demand rates\u2014rather than the expected value to LCSC if it were to become t he owner/operator. The owner s maintained that a $3.8M price would be a bargain in li ght of the costs the Stat e would incur to obtain a new facility. CTDI stressed that it had invested over $6.2M in the property. The Nez-Perce County Assessor (in April 2 008) placed a $3.8M value on the residential portion of the property . In conjunction with its rejection (see Atch 3) of LCSC's offer, the owner's provided a copy of their investment bank's independent appraisal of the property (Key Bank appr aisal excerpts at Atch 4)\u2014 which they maintained supported a val ue to LCSC of over $3.5M, plus $300K value added in light of LCSC's future occupancy growth, for a total counter offer of $3.8M. The owners cont end that the value of the residential portion of the building if LCSC were to assume direct ownership (rather than manage on behalf of some other investor gr oup which would assume CTDI 's limitations under the current management agreement ) is $5.3M. Structural Assessment: LCSC engaged a structural engineer to examine the condition of the premises. Two signific ant areas requiring prom pt attention were noted: installation of missing grout in bear ing plates supporting some of the steel columns for the structure to increas e seismic resistance, and repairing (\"tuckpointing\") some of the mortar on the bricks for some of the original masonry on the older section of the building. LCSC's portion of the associated repair costs are estimated to be $100K or less. Financing: The College has worked cl osely with financial advisors to analyze possible financing options for the purchase, if it were to be acceptable to the Board. The College's offer assumes an amortization period of 27 years, based on financing via a 4.9% secured note, wit h a balloon payment after 15 years. Potential revenues are projected at an 80% average annual occupancy rate during the regular aca demic year over the life of the investment, with only token revenue projected for summer months. LCSC's offer price would include purchase of all furniture (new condition) already in place in the facility. LCSC's proposed $3.7M counter-offer would represent fair value for the facility and its fixtures and furniture, providi ng funding to make minor repairs or upgrades to the facility, as needed. IMPACT During the period of the owner s' financial difficulties, and despite high turnover of personnel at CTDI, the College has been able to sustain normal operations at Clearwater Hall. As of the ti me of writing, Clearwater Hall is full, and there is a waiting list for residence hall spaces with students temporarily housed in make-BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 4 shift dorm quarters (occupancy rates have increased over 19% compared to Fall 2007). If a suitable purchase arrangement cannot be worked out, LCSC students now living in (or programmed to backfill future openings in) Clearwater Hall may have to be relocated for the 2008-2009 school year, or, if foreclosure were to occur, operations at the facility might have to be negotiated out with the owners' bankers. Timely closure on a purchase w ould minimize disruptions to students and would channel revenue streams immediately to LCSC. The Board strongly encouraged the priv ate-public partnership approach as a method of quickly and inexpensively expa nding residence space at LCSC. A good faith effort to sustain this existi ng residence hall would help support LCSC's students and the College's relations with ot her partners and the local community. If the purchase is authorized by the Board, the College wi ll maintain its current approval rights over the type of tenant busi nesses that would be eligible to lease the downstairs commercial space in cl ose proximity to student residents. If the Board approves LCSC's request to ma ke a counter-offer of $3.7M for the facility, and if that offer were to be accepted by the owners, the College will proceed immediately to secure financing to lock in favorable interest rates, under the approach outlined above. The College assesses t hat a purchase of the facility lies within the financia l means of the institutio n and, under conservative assumptions, the business m odel would result in positiv e net cash flows to the College within approximately 10 years. Ownership of the facility would enable LCSC to improve services for its gr owing population of student residents, decommission decrepit residence facilities, and improve utilization rates and quality factors for the College's re sidential program as a whole.

Wh ile the institution is not purchasing a new building, they believe the building has not depreciated very much in 2 years. The value of the bui lding based on the construction costs and 75% of the building would be $4.65M compared to the app raised value of $2.8M. CTDI is still the owners and managers. The current estimated occupancy rate is about 100%. The prior year's occupancy rate was below 80% in part as a result of over-capacity getting ahe ad of actual growth. Ev en though occupancy is estimated about 100%, CTDI still wants to remove themselves from the financial risk. Clearwater Hall is at 100% capacity and there is a waiting list for residence hall spaces.

There has not been a condominium declaration or documents prepared for transferring the ownership of these upper floors. This appraisal assumes that the final condo documents will include the basic areas outlined in this report with commonarea access to the main floor lobby/elevator/stairwell area. There are no atypical appraisal problems,except that this type of facility rarely sells. This appraisal assumes that there is no significant hazardous contamination and the opinions of value are predicated on a \"clean\" site. Delineation of Title In 2004-05, Clearwater Historic Development, LLC acquired 402 Main, a three-story brick building know as the Adams Building and 410 Main, a vacant parcel that had been developed with a three story 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 11 Michael J.

Clearwater designed, remodeled and built the existing buildings in 2006. On April 26, 2006, the subject parcels were transferred to College Town Development Idaho, LLC by Quit Claim Deed. Purpose and Intended Use The purpose of this appraisal is to estimate the market value of the fee simple interest in the subject property \"As Is\" on April 8, 2008. The function and intended use of this appraisal is to provide the client with value estimates as a basis for purchase and collateral loan purposes. Real property includes the interest, benefits and rights inherent in the ownership of physical real estate, subject to the four powers of government; that is, taxation, eminent domain, police power and escheat. A fee simple estate is an estate without limitations or restrictions. A leased fee estate is a property held in fee with the right of use and occupancy conveyed by lease to others. Scope of the Analysis To estimate the market value of the fee simple interest in the subject parcels, I have investigated the market in which the subject is situated and attempted to identify and analyze all relevant data that may affect or indicate property value. These data include economic and demographic trends, comparablesales data, absorption rates, rental information including vacancy and expenses, and significant rates and ratios relating to value. In my research, I interviewed sellers, purchasers, brokers and other individuals familiar with value, sales and trends in the market. In developing this appraisal, I have attempted to be aware of, understand, and correctly employ the recognized methods and techniques necessary to produce a credible appraisal. Each appraisal generally includes the Cost Approach, Sales Comparison Approach and Income Approach to Value. This is a complete summary appraisal that includes a sufficient analysis of the Cost, Sales and Income approaches. I performed a physical inspection of the subject property, including the site and exterior and interior of the improvements. The local and regional market was surveyed and researched for data and factors that relate to and impact the value of the subject property. The local and regional market was investigated and researched for similar comparable sales and rental data so that an estimate of value by the Sales Comparison and Income Approaches could be made. When possible, sales data were verified by the buyer, seller, or broker. A rental survey was also made to identify both market rent levels and vacancies for the Income Approach. In my opinion, the complete appraisal process per USPAP requirements was performed. For the purpose of this assignment, I have considered the Cost, Income and Sales Comparison Approaches to Value. I have gathered data from the Cities of Lewiston and Clarkston, Nez Perce County, State of Idaho, various brokers and sales people, as well as buyers and sellers in the county in order to compile sufficient information from which to form an opinion of value on the subject property. Definition of Value Market Value is defined as: \"The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 12 Michael J.

Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 2. Both parties are well informed or well advised, and both acting in what they consider their own best interest; 3. A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;4. Payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars and in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and 5. The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold, unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 1\" Conformity with the USPAP and Competency Provision This appraisal has been developed to conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation, and with the Standards of Professional Practice and Code of Ethics of the Appraisal Institute. I have not departed from the USPAP. The appraisal is reported in a summary format. In my opinion, all significant information necessary to reach a reasonable value conclusion has been disclosed in the report. I am familiar with the appraisal of this type of property and with the locale in which the subject is located. I believe I have sufficient education and experience to appraise the subject property. I have not appraised any similar apartment style cluster housing, however, I have appraised college apartmentsover the last eight to ten years. I have researched the market for sales and consulted other knowledgeable appraisers regarding the appraisal of similar facilities. Consequently, I found no need to take special measures to conform to the competency provision of the USPAP. No information that was required or considered necessary for the completion of the appraisal is unavailable. Adequate information was gathered from which to form an opinion of value. However, if in the future additional pertinent information becomes available, I reserve the right to consider the information and its impact on the value estimated herein. Such review and consideration may be at an additional fee. Reasonable Exposure/Marketing Period The exposure period is the length of time the subject property would have been offered for sale prior to the date of the appraisal at a price that would have resulted in a sale at the estimated value on the date ofthe appraisal. The marketing period is the time required for the sale of the subject property as of the date of value, recognizing its characteristics and the market conditions. The subject property is of a size and quality that would be attractive to many investors. It is located in an attractive downtown area with good exposure and access. Most of the sales used in the Sales Comparison Approach were of comparable properties with an exposure /marketing time of generally less than one year. 1Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under 12 CFR, Part 34, Subpart C-Appraisals, 34.42, Definitions (f). 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 13 Michael J.

Nearly 90% of the area's population lives within the city limits of the two primary urban areas. The valley population ha s grown only about 1.5% over the last five years while the State of Idaho has grown 10.5%. There has been little in-migration and expansion of the employment base. However, unemployment remains fairly low with an average unemployment of less than 4%. Lewiston and the Moscow/Pullman area, located about 30 miles to the north, are rivals for regional shopping in North Central Idaho, Southeastern Washington, and the Northeastern Oregon area. Lewiston has long been the dominant supply and financial center of the region, however, in recent years, Moscow/Pullman has proven serious competition with two shopping malls. A new shopping center, including a Payless Drug Store and a Safeway grocery store, was completed a few years ago in Pullman. Both communities have added Wal-Marts with the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley now having the only Costco. Moscow and Pullman are the locations of the University of Idaho and Washington State University, respectively. The most important economic base to the Lewiston-Clarkston area in addition to the Potlatch Corporation is the most easterly extension of the Columbia-Snake Inland Waterway. With the completion of the Lower Granite Dam in 1975, slack water navigation reached the area continuing to expand the economy and creating several ports. The main products being shipped downstream are logs and grain from the Ports of Clarkston, Wilma and Lewiston. Chips are being shipped to U.S. Ports of the West Coast, while logs are being shipped as far as the Orient. Finished paper products from the Potlatch Corporation are also being shipped from Lewiston to ports all over the world. The major employer in the area is Potlatch Corporation with \u00b12,100 employees and a pulp and paper mill located east of the Lewiston city limits. Potlatch continues to operate two plywood mills at two other North Idaho locations. It has shut down several sawmills in other communities in recent years; however, their pulp and paper mill remains profitable and is the dominant industry in the area. Regence-Blue Shield of Idaho employs \u00b11,000 in the region and ATK (formerly Blount/Omark),employs \u00b1680 and constructed a new plant in the Lewiston Orchards providing 40 new jobs. Bennett Lumber Products (sawmill) is the largest employer in Clarkston. St. Joseph Medical Center with \u00b1808 employees, Lewiston School District with \u00b1710, Lewis-Clark State College with 720 and Clarkston School District with 350 employees are other large employers in the area. Recent additions to the retail market include Wal-Mart and Costco who each developed 155,000 square foot outlets respectively in Lewiston and Clarkston. Other relatively recent projects have included a Big 5 Sporting Goods, Home Depot, Staples, and Petco. Several banks, small retail centers and restaurants as well as a new Safeway have opened in recent years. Though the new stores have created hundreds of jobs, many of them were simply transfers from the smaller retail outlets no longer able to 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 17 Michael J.

The demand for older/smaller commercial properties is less than the current supply, and a high vacancy rate, particularly among older buildings in secondary locations is occurring. The local economy is expected to be stable, with a slow growth pattern fueled by normal population increases. The outlook for most secondary and older real estate is for limited demand in the short termand a stable pattern over the long term. Until the demand for goods and services increases to a level that will support the occupancy of the available space, the vacancy rates will remain relatively high and real estate sales and leases will continue at a sluggish pace. NEIGHBORHOOD DESCRIPTION Neighborhood Map 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 18 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 22CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 MSN Aerial looking South. The subject properties are located at the southwesterly corner of Main Street and 5th Street near the core of the downtown area. The \"central business di strict\" is that area south of the Clearwater River from roughly a few blocks west of the Highway 12 bridge on the east to the Snake River on the west. This is a \u00b1three to five block wide area running along the north side of a steep bluff upon which the remainder of Lewiston is constructed. The neighborhood is generally one to three story commercial facilities including general office, banks, general retail and some entertainment businesses such as lounges and restaurants. The original commercial improvements were built in the early 1900's with some construction in the 1970's and 1980's. There has been little new construction over the past \u00b120 years, although there has been some major remodeling projects. Main Street is a one-way, two lane arterial through the westerly \u00b110 blocks of the downtown area, coupled with D Street, one block north. Across 5 th Street to the east of the subject is a two-story, multi-tenant, mixed use retail and office complex with street level entries on both levels from Main and F Streets. In the block to the east is mo stly two story buildings with mostly retail uses on the main floor and office uses above. Across Main Street from the subject property is an older, two-story brick building housing some Lewis-Clark State College outreach facilities. Further west are one and two story retail and office buildings including some lounges and restaurants. Because of the steep bluff south of the downtown area, north/south access to and through the area is limited to just a few streets including 5 th Street, 8th and 14th. The downtown streets are mostly two lane, with traffic lights at major intersections. East/west access is via D and Main Streets and a 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 19 Michael J.

The majority of the rest of the streets in the neighborhood are paved, two lane city streets with curbs and sidewalks. All utilities are available throughout the neighborhood. Electricity, natural gas and telephone service are provided by private companies. Municipal water and sewer is available from the City of Lewiston. The subject remodel and new construction is one of a very few new projects in the downtown area over the past ten years. The downtown area is mostly older buildings with generally smaller retail users and office tenants. Most new retail and restaurant construction has been along 21 st Street and Thain Road in southeast Lewiston. Recent construction has included a large Wal-Mart, Home Depot and similar facilities. The downtown area remains a stable identifiable commercial district with a good mix of commercial, retail, office and service businesses. It is the location of the County Courthouse complex, City offices and police department. The general outlook is continued stability, but with slow to moderate growth. There is a substantial amount of vacant storefronts in the downtown area, some of which have been vacant for a few years. There has been little demand for space by new retail tenants because the new growth and development has been along 21 st, Thain Road and other suburban arterials. The downtown has been is a slow decline for decades with some changes to a lower intensity use for many buildings. The population growth is projected at less than 1% per year, and it could be a few years before the present supply of commercial buildings in the downtown Lewiston area is absorbed.

Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 25CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 Size and Topography : The subject site is an irregular parcel with \u00b1198ft on Main Street and a maximum depth of \u00b1260ft on 5th Street with a minimum width of \u00b1155.02ft on the west. The total site area is \u00b139,100sf , according to my measurements of the above plat map. The useable area is \u00b119,500sf because of the steep hillside in the south half of the site. No soil survey was taken, but the site appears to be of a sandy clay loam with some rock outcroppings typical of the Lewiston area with no major construction problems evident in the surrounding, older buildings. The property does not appear to be within a Federally Identified Flood Hazard Area and is in Zone C on FIRM CP1601040001B, effective 1/20/1982. Access : Almost all of the entire useable area of the site is developed with the building improve- ments with vehicle access off 5th Street at the southeast corner of the useable portion of the site. If vacant, the parcel could presumably be developed with some vehicle access from Main Street. Both Main and 5th are arterials providing the site with good access to most areas of Lewiston and Clarkston. Services : The City of Lewiston provides water and sewer service. Refuse service; electricity, natural gas, and cable television services are available from private purveyors. Police and fire protection are good with no public bus service currently available. Hazardous Materials : No Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment was provided for this appraisal. I am not qualified to detect or evaluate the inappropriate storage or disposal of hazardous material or products, although no suspicious containers or leaks were observed. The client should seek a Level 1 site assessment from a qualified provider if they so desire. The appraiser's conclusions of values assume that the property is free of any significant contamination. I reserve the right to re-analyze the value conclusions if significant contamination is found. Presumably any site remediation was done before the new building was constructed in 2006. Zoning: The subject parcels are zoned C-4, General Commercial in the City of Lewiston. This zone allows a wide variety of commercial uses including retail sales and services, service stations, eating and drinking establishments, offices, banks and personal service uses. The existing use is allowed under this zone. Parking standards vary depending upon the use. The subject property is within the boundaries of the Central Business District where parking requirements do not apply. If not within the CBD, the subject facility would need 95 parking spaces. Easements and Encroachments : A preliminary title report was not provided for this appraisal. Only the typical utility easements are assumed to encumber the subject parcels. Based on a visual inspection of the subject parcels, there does not appear to be any easements or encroachments that adversely affect the subject's use and utility. According to the plans furnished for this assignment,some of the brick facing on the existing west building may be in the right of way for Main Street. This is not uncommon for old buildings in the downtown area. Assessed Valuation and Taxes : The subject parcels are assessed under Nez Perce County Assessor's Parcel No.'s RPL0360029002AA, RPL 03600290010A and RPL0360029002BA. The total current assessed value is $100,650 for the land and $4,153,921 for the improvements for a total of $4,254,571. 2007 taxes were $78,971.26. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 23 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 26CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 Improvement Description The westerly \u00b190ft of the subject property is improved with a three-story building constructed in 1910 and formerly known as the \"Adams Building\". It has a concrete foundation and is of concrete, steel and brick construction with brick exterior walls. It was remodeled in 2006 in conjunction with the construction of the new four-story building attached to the east. Exterior windows were replaced with fixed, vinyl, double and single hung, thermo-pane with low e glass. The interior second and third floors have mostly wood frame partitions with painted drywall walls and ceilings. Interior finish is the same as the new building and described below. The new structure has a reinforced concrete foundation, a steel frame and has a combination of brick veneer and hardi-lap siding for the second through fourth floors above a first floor of reinforced concrete. It has vinyl windows, with steel and safety glass exterior doors. The roof is single ply membrane over tapered, rigid insulation up to R-38 on a steel deck. Exterior walls have R-21 batt insulation. The second floor is 6\" composite concrete on a steel deck with steel floor joists. The third and fourth floors are 1.5\" concrete on a plywood deck with wood TJI joists. Interior construction is 6\" metal stud partition walls with painted drywall walls and ceilings. Floors are mostly commercial grade carpet with sheet vinyl in kitchenette and bathroom areas as well as the laundry area and some sealed concrete in storage and maintenance areas. The interior of the old building is remodeled into two, four-bedroom suites and two, five-bedroom suites per floor with a laundry facility on the second floor and a study room on the third floor. Each suite has a small common room with limited kitchenette of \u00b14ft or 5ft counter space, small refrigerator and wall-mounted microwave. The five bedroom suites have two bathrooms each with a 4ft and 5ft vanity, 36\" square, fiberglass shower stall and toilet area. Each bedroom has a lock-off door, and motel style, electric, through-the-wall or ceiling mounted HVAC system. Each floor has a handicap accessible restroom in the hallway next to the entry to the new building. The interior of the new building contains six, 4-bedroom, one bath suites and one 2-bedroom, one bath suite on the second floor and five, 4-bedroom, one bath suites and two, 3-bedroom, one bath suites on the third and fourth floors. Each floor also has a one-bed room, one bath suite for the resident assistant. All of the suites have a \u00b14ft vanity with single sink and about half of the suites have \u00b15ft feet of kitchenette counters and the others have \u00b14ft. All have a 36\" square, fiberglass shower stall and toilet area. Each bedroom has a lock-off door, and motel style, electric, through-the-wall or ceiling mounted HVAC system. The central common area between the two buildings has a lounge area, elevator access and stairwell. Each building has a second central stairwell providing access to Main Street for the old building and off the second level to the rear of the new building. Site Improvements : The buildings occupy most of the useable portion of the subject parcels. There are retaining walls and chain link fencing along the south line of the useable portion. There are four ft, six ft and 8ft wide sidewalks leading from the rear of the second floor of the new building and used as primarypedestrian access to the complex. There is also a small amount of lawn, crushed rock landscaped area and a concrete maintenance vehicle parking pad in front of a fenced dumpster area. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 24 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 27CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 Quality and Condition : The improvements are of average to good quality and appeal. The existing building was completely gutted and rebuilt with new windows, insulation, electric wiring, plumbing and roof cover as well as new partition walls and interior finish. The effective age of all of the improve- ments is about two years. Functional Utility : The improvements have adequate functional utility for their intended use as student housing in conjunction with Lewis-Clark State College. The floor plans are functional, although common area kitchenette/living rooms and toilet/shower areas are small. Clearance is 3ft past the showers and 2.75ft in the toilet area. Personal Property, Fixtures, and Equipment Each suite is equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, table and two chairs as well as single beds, small desks with chairs and wardrobe closets in each bedroom. There is also common area furniture, washers and dryers in the laundry room and study room tables and chairs. All of these items are needed for the facility to function as student housing and included in the valuation of the facility. Occupancy and Use of Subject The subject facility is leased to Lewis-Clark State College for use as student housing. They lease only the second through fourth floors and access through the common lobby with elevator and stairwell on the main floor between the two buildings. The lease will be discussed in the IncomeApproach section of this report. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 25 Michael J.

The opinion of such use may be based on the highest and most profitable continuous use to which the property is adapted and needed, or likely to be in demand in the reasonably near future. However, elements affecting value that depend upon events or a combination of occurrences that, while within the realm of possibilities are not fairly shown to be reasonably probable should be excluded from consideration. Also, if the intended use is dependent upon an uncertain act of another person, the intention cannot be considered.\" \"That use of the land which may reasonably be expected to produce the greatest net return to land over a given period of time. That legal use which will yield to land the highest present value; sometimes called optimum use.\" 2 The following tests must be passed in determining highest and best use. The use must be legal. The use must be probable, not speculative or conjectural. There must be a demand for such use. The use mustbe profitable. The use must be such as to return to land the highest net return. The use must be such as to deliver the return for the longest period of time. The Subject Parcels As Vacant Physical Uses : The useable area of the subject parcels is \u00b119,500sf with good frontage and visibility along Main Street at 5 th Street in nearly the center of the downtown area. A variety of uses are physically possible including most commercial uses of the surrounding properties. Typical buildings in the general area are one to three stories with a scattering of older, taller buildings. Legal Uses : The subject parcels are zoned C-4, General Commercial under the current Zoning Ordinance. This zone allows for a wide variety of commercial uses. Surrounding uses include boutique retail, offices, banks and general commercial uses. Reasonable and Probable Uses : Because of their size, location and accessibility, the most reasonable and probable uses of the subject parcels, if vacant, would be for development with two-story, mixed- use, general commercial buildings with adequate access, landscaping and some parking. This location is near the center of the downtown area of Lewiston. There has been limited demand for new commercial and office uses in the general area with most new development outside of the downtown area partly due to a lack of onsite or adjacent parking in the downtown area. Many of the typical downtown tenants, including commercial banks have moved to the suburbs. The sites could accommodate a wide variety of mixed commercial uses. Single or multi-tenant buildings of up to \u00b155,000sf could be developed on four floors including parking. One possible scenario would be to develop the ground floor with retail with the next two levels for parking and two levels of office and/or apartments above. Conclusion - Highest and Best Use as if Vacant : In my opinion, the highest and best use of the subject parcels as vacant would be for single or multi-tenant, mixed use commercial buildings of two to 2 American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers - Appraisal Terminology and Handbook 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 29 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 32CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 three stories. Demand for new buildings has been slow with no new buildings in the last twenty or more years. Most new construction has been to the southeast of the subject parcels along 21st Street, Thain Road and in the Orchards area. It may be several years before a large mixed-use project would be feasible. Unless a buyer with a specific use was found, the likely purchaser if the parcels were vacant would be a speculative investor willing to hold the parcels for future development. The Subject Site as Improved The subject parcels are improved with a three and four story development with retail space on the Main Street level and two and three levels of resident suites above. This appraisal is only of the upper level resident suites. The total gross area is \u00b134,314sf above a \u00b113,392sf first floor that is unfinished retail. There are 32 suites with 117 bedrooms. Before the subject facility was constructed in 2006, Lewis-Clark State College, LCSC was having to rent rooms in the Red Lion Motel on 21 st Street about 1.5 miles from campus. Beginning in the fall of 2003, the College rented 23 rooms with steady increases each fall to 47 rooms for the fall of 2005. During 2005 and early 2006, the subject facility was constructed along with the 88 bedroom, College Place located across 4 th St from the campus. This created an abundance of student housing. The College has tried to balance occupancy between the two new facilities, but the overall occupancy rate for all student housing has declined to 85% to 88% for the fall enrollment and 64% to 66% for the spring semester. Because two projects were built when only one was needed, the supply far exceeds the demand at the present time. As a result, overall occupancy is less than desirable for both College Place and the subject Clearwater Hall. Although the College may eventually remove some older facilities from the housing pool, overall occupancy will still remain below desirable levels for the next few years. The College closed Talkington, a 95 room facility for the fall of 2006 that substantially helped increase occupancy for the subject and College Place and may close the 29 room Parrish House next year. That would also boost occupancy for the subject by an average of 10 rooms per semester. However, overall occupancy will still be below 60% because of the slow summer months. The rental market in Lewiston is not very strong and there has been no new construction of large apartment complexes greater than 10 units for several years. The College is unable to demand that students rent or reserve rooms during the summer months and is trying to increase occupancy by renting blocks of rooms for a variety of activities including sports camps, music camps and even family reunions. Occupancy during the summer months will be fairly slow for the next few years and may not approach 20% or 20 to 25 rooms per month for a couple of years. In my opinion, the subject facility is a special use limited primarily to student housing because of its design and lack of additional onsite amenities such as parking. Parking appears to be a limiting factor for the retail space on the main level that is not a part of this appraisal. The retail space has been offered for lease for two years and is still vacant. It is competing with space along 21 st and Thain Road that has adequate, drive-up parking for customers as well as employees. Other buildings in the downtown area also appear to suffer from the lack of parking with vacancy levels higher than in the outlying areas. Parking would also help if the subj ect student housing were to be converted to another use such as offices or senior housing. In my opinion, it would not be cost effective to convert the subject facility from student housing to 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 30 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 33CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 senior housing. It is possible to convert the units, however, the bathroom areas are too narrow for access by walkers, people with canes or wheelchairs. The toilet areas are even narrower and would be tight for handicap rails or pull bars. It would be expensive to remodel the bathrooms to be acceptable for elderly housing. Most of the bedrooms are designed for a single bed and do not have built-in closets or room for additional furniture. The community facilities needed for a senior housing facility would have to be constructed on the main floor of the subject building that is not a part of this appraisal. Senior housing generally has large community rooms, game rooms, exercise rooms and community eating areas as well as a commercial kitchen. These would all have to be developed on the main floor. It is beyond the scope of this appraisal to assess the demand for senior housing in downtown Lewiston. Lewiston is a retirement area for the surrounding farming communities in north central Idaho, but new facilities are mostly one-story and located in th e suburban areas closer to new shopping areas and medical and dental offices. A 42 unit facility was built in 2007 on Bryden. The lack of convenient parking would again be a detriment for any senior facility that would be competing with new suburban facilities. The small rooms and shared bathrooms would also be less than desirable. There does not appear to be a strong demand for new office space in the downtown area, again, due in part to a lack of convenient parking. It would be less expensive to convert the apartment suites into office suites. Most of the suites could be utilized as they are with the living/kitchenette areas used for reception and the bedrooms for private offices. The restrooms would also not need to be upgraded because each floor has a handicap accessible restroom in the hallway. The biggest drawback would be lack of demand for office space without convenient pa rking. Also, office suites would be limited to the size of the existing apartment suites without substantial remodeling. There would also be a lack of large executive offices without remodeling. In my opinion, the subject is a special use facility limited to student housing in bedroom suites with the existing layout without substantial expense to convert to another use. There does not appear to be a strong demand that would absorb \u00b134,314sf of office space or other uses that would be feasible. SUMMARY OF VALUATION ANALYSIS The subject property is the second through fourth floors of a two building complex connected by a common lobby/elevator/stairwell area. No condominium declaration or other documents have been prepared, however, I assume that the necessary documents will be drawn to closely reflect the property as described. Because the subject improvements are a two-year, special purpose facility, the Cost Approach is considered as an indication of the value before any deductions for being an over improvement. Recent land sales have been analyzed to estimate the contributory value of the subject site for the subject 32 units. No sales of newer dormitories or apartment project similar to the subject were found in the Washington, Idaho or Oregon area. I have uses sales of improved apartment properties in Moscow and Pullman in order to derive some indications of value by the Sales Comparison Approach was concluded. A rental survey was conducted to identify market rent, vacancies, and expenses, and to provide the basis to estimate the net operating income for the subject. Capitalization rates were derived from the comparable investment properties, and a value estimate by the Income Approach was concluded. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 31 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 34CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 COST APPROACH The Cost Approach normally involves estimating the cost new of the improvements and depreciation from all sources. This is added to the estimated land value as if vacant and ready for development to its highest and best use. Because this is a special use facility, the Cost Approach will be a primarymethod in forming an opinion of value. LAND VALUE The market value of the subject site, as if vacant, is estimated by direct comparison with recent sales of land similar to the subject site in terms of physical and locational features, and Highest and Best Use. Since the subject property is valued as a condominium above retail space on Main Street, I have attempted to form an opinion of value of the contributory value of the land on a price per unit basis, based upon what a developer would pay to develop an apartment complex or senior housing center of similar size. Only two sales of larger apartment complexes were found in the Lewiston area over the past two years. A 24, 920sf site at 5 th & Linden was purchased for a 10 unit apartment in February 2007 for $85,000 or $8,500/unit. A 140,575sf parcel at 906 Bryden was purchased in January 2007 for $425,000 for a 42 unit senior housing center or $10,119/unit. A 10 unit apartment site of 48,730sf was purchased in May 2003 at 1 st Street and 19th Avenue for $95,000 or $9,500/unit. A 66,952sf site at 230 Baker Street in Moscow, Idaho was purchased in March 2008 for $301,282 or $8,369/unit for a 36 unit apartment complex. Land Value Conclusion The subject parcels are in a good location but not as good as some of the comparables for apartment development. The sales summarized above show a range of \u00b1$8,500 to $10,100/unit for typical apartment projects in the Lewiston area. In my opinion, a rate of $9,500/unit would be reasonable for the subject project. This rate applied to the 32 units results in a value indication of $304,000 . IMPROVEMENT VALUE The subject project was reportedly constructed for a cost of \u00b1$6,000,000 in 2005-06 including the \u00b113,392sf main floor. The total overall cost for the \u00b147,706sf was \u00b1$125.77/sf including the land and site improvements. TheMarshall Valuation Service Cost Handbook indicates a current cost for an average quality, Class A, steel frame, dormitory facility similar to the subject with brick, steel or concrete panel exterior walls with some ornamentation, interior walls and ceilings of drywall and carpet floors, one bath per three students, and average electric service of $121.77 after allowances for local cost adjustments. This description best fits the subject improvements. A \u00b144,000sf, three-story, brick and steel, 160 bed dormitory is under construction at Whitworth College in Spokane at a reported cost near $7,000,000 or $159.09/sf. This facility will include lounge areas and a large kitchen area as well as more bathrooms than the subject facility. The cost is approximate and included demolition of two small, older dorms. It is supportive of the cost indicated by the cost service. For this analysis, I have used a building cost of $120.00/sf including plans, engineering, permits and sewer connection. This cost includes all soft costs except financing costs and developer's profit. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 32 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 35CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 The site improvements of paving, landscaping, sidewalks, fencing, retaining walls and exterior lighting have been added in at $100,000, which is about $2.91/sf including a pro-rata share of soft costs. These costs are based on the Marshall Valuation Service and the known costs for local site improvements. Entrepreneurial Profit & Financing Costs Entrepreneurial profit is the measure of a fee that a developer will earn upon the sale of an investmentproperty that compensates him for putting together the various elements required in a successful real estate investment project. These elements include the acquisition of the land, construction of the building and the leasing of the project to appropriate tenants at a market rental rate. In my opinion, entrepreneurial profit of 8% would be reasonable for the subject property. Financing costs include interest during construction and the financing fee. Based on a loan of $4,000,000 and a 6.25% interest rate, construction interest for one year is estimated at $250,000 and the financing fee at $60,000. DEPRECIATION Depreciation may occur in three basis forms; physical, functional, or from external forces. Physical depreciation includes such things as the age of the improvements, general wear and tear, and deferred maintenance. This depreciation may be curable or incurable. Functional obsolescence is present if the design and/or building characteristics are not well conceived or well utilized. External obsolescence is when forces outside the subject property cause an adverse influence. This could occur through depressed market conditions, certain legislative actions, neighborhood transitions, adverse adjacent property influences, or various other reasons. The subject improvements are about two years old and have been reasonably maintained with no extra- ordinary wear or abuse noted on inspection. Based on a normal economic life of \u00b140 years, physical depreciation of 5% would be reasonable for general wear. The subject improvements are functional for their intended use as student housing with little wasted space and serviceable floor plans. The bedroomsare of adequate size, the bathrooms are utilitarian and the common areas are somewhat small but functional. There is no basis for any additional charge for functional obsolescence in my opinion. The subject facility was built at the same time that a competing facility was built with 88 rooms across from the College. As a result, both facilities have suffered some economic loss due to an over supply of student housing for the next several years. In the Sales Comparison Approach analysis, I have estimatedan adjustment of 25% for the economic loss. This is primarily due to the vacancy in the units during the summer months, although, occupancy during the school year is also lower than the typical \u00b195% occupancy expected for competing apartment units. Occupancy is expected to increase over the next few years and a long-term allowance for external obsolescence of 25% appears reasonable. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 33 Michael J.

To employ the Sales Comparison Approach, the market is researched for recent sales of improved properties similar to the subject. These comparable sales are then compared to the subject for physical, functional, and economic differences. IMPROVED SALES To value the subject property via the Sales Comparison Approach, the general Inland Northwest area was researched for sales of similar, newer, student housing or dormitories. I have researched the Eastern Washington and North Idaho area for sales of similar facilities. My research included perusing national sales data basis including Costar and LoopNet, calling various other appraisers in North Idaho and Eastern Washington, as well as Assessor's offices in several counties. I was not able to find any comparable sales of similar dormitories or student housing. In order to form some opinion of the value of the subject improvements, I analyzed eight sales of newer apartment complexes in the Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington area. These are larger college towns, home to the University of Idaho and Washington State University, respectively. The apartmentmarket in both cities is generally driven by the dema nd for student housing. As a result, I have analyzed the sales on a price per bedroom as well as the more traditional price per unit, price per square foot and gross rent multiplier. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 34 Michael J.

The sales are adjusted for seller contracts, below market financing, cash equivalency and conditions of sale. The resulting analysis price is the basis for additional adjustments for differences in physical features. Each sale has differing building sizes, number of units, bedrooms and bathrooms. Thesales span a time period of about four years. During this time, the market for residential incomeproperties has been relatively strong in Nez Perce County, North Idaho and Eastern Washington. A market conditions adjustment of 5% per year was made for the sales. The most significant adjustment is for the location of the subject facility in Lewiston where the occupancy rate is reduced because of the oversupply of student housing caused by the construction of two competing projects at the same time with nearly twice as many units as were needed, although the College did close a 95 room older dormitory to offset some of the oversupply. During the first full year of occupancy, the subject facility averaged 45.7% for the 12 months to the end of August 2007. Average occupancy for the nine-month school year was 61%. For the next nine months, the average occupancy was 61.7% through May 2008. Occupancy during the school year should gradually increase over the next couple of years to \u00b175%. The College has alwa ys had a problem with spring quarter enrollment and occupancy with a differential of \u00b120% to 25% between the fall semester and the spring semester for mostyears from 2001 through 2008. (See chart and graph on Page 46) The differential has been narrowing over the last two years, declining from 38% to 48% in 2003 and 2004. In my opinion, occupancy levels should stabilize at 85% average for the nine month school year within a few years and 25% during the summer months. This would result in an average annual occupancy rate of 70% compared to a \u00b195% average occupancy rate for the comparable sales. I have used an adjustment of 25% for location, which is the difference in the average occupancy rate. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 43 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 38CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 SALES COMPARISON APPROACH CONCLUSION The sales produced adjusted rates of $53.04/sf to $85.51/sf. The subject has more bedrooms per unit and is larger than most of the comparables. In my opinion, a value rate toward the high end of the range would be appropriate. At $80/sf the 34,314sf of gross area has an indicated value of $2,745,120. The sales produced a range of $47,743/unit to $87,057/unit. At $85,000/unit, the 32 units have an indicated value of $2,720,000. The indicated range per bedroom was $22,826 to $32,835, with six sales indicating a narrower range of $23,871 to $28,101. The subject has fewer bathrooms and less kitchen amenities than the comparables and a rate towards the middle of the range would be reasonable. At $25,000/bedroom, the indicated value for the 117 bedrooms is $2,925,000. At an effective gross rent multiplier of 8.25, the stabilized effective gross income of $402,358 has an indicated value of $3,319,454. In my opinion, the indicated value of the subject complex is $2,925,000 by the Sales Comparison Approach. INCOME APPROACH The Income Approach to Value is based on the premise that a knowledgeable purchaser would pay no more for the property than the cost of obtaining an equally desirable, similar property as an investment, providing similar risk and opportunities for return on and return of the investment. This approach analyzes the value of the property through the eyes of a typical investor. The gross income the property can generate is estimated by comparison with competitive properties. Deductions are made for expenses paid by the owner, resulting in an indication of net income. Net income is then capitalized into a value estimate at a rate that is commensurate with the risks inherent with the ownership of the property. This approach is most appropriate where there is an active rental and investor-driven market for the type of property being appraised. Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC) has a management agreement with College Town Development Idaho, LLC through the State of Idaho, acting by and through the State of Idaho Board of Education as Board Trustees for LCSC. The initial term is 120 months (10 years) beginning August 23, 2006. The agreement contains a voluntary termination clause by providing the other party with written notice on or before March 1 st of any year with termination on August 14th of the then applicable calendar year. LCSC will manage the day-to-day operation of Clearwater Hall including collecting all rents, paying all bills and maintaining all areas except the first floor retail spaces. The owner will pay real property and personal property taxes, real estate and liability insurance, and all utilities and will reimburse LCSC for all maintenance costs, except lawn mowing, trimming of shrubbery and other routine lawn maintenance. LCSC uses their general facilities maintenance crew to maintain the subject property. The initial minimum monthly rent for the first lease year was $390/residence unit (bedroom), inclusive of the cost of local telephone and basic cable TV in the common room of each pod and broadband internet service in each residence unit. The rent has been renegotiated for 2007-08 to $365/residence unit except for $335 for two small bedrooms and $395 for four large bedrooms.LCSC owes rent on a unit if occupied on the first day of the month, regardless of whether a student is 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 45 Michael J.

The agreement provides for annual escalations of the minimum rent of not less than 3% per year, however, because of the vacancy rate in the project, this provision has not been utilized. LCSC is to receive a management fee of 2% of rent installments paid if the amount is between 85% and 90% of potential gross rent, 3% if between 90% and 95% and 4% if 95% or higher. At the current occupancy levels, no management fee is due. There have been few management agreements similar to the subject. College Place has an agreement modeled after the subject agreement, according to LCSC staff. There rental payment was $375/unit for fiscal 2008. The units are slightly larger and located across from the college with some on-site parking. Brewster Hall at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Washington was constructed in 2002 and master leased to the University. It is 4-stories with a main floor of retail and located on a secondary street in downtown Cheney, at 410 2 nd Street, one block north of the main street. It has 135 rooms of similar construction to the subject. Eastern is a much larger campus with enrollment over 7,500. The 2009 school year rate for Brewster Hall is $527.89/month. Vacancy For the first nine months of occupancy, the average occupancy was 61.0% with no summer occupancy leaving a 12 month occupancy rate of 45.7% with the fall semester at 78.0% and the spring at 47.4%. For the past nine month school year, the occupancy level increased slightly to 61.7% with overall 12 month occupancy at 46.3% if no activity during the summer months. If summer occupancy averages 15 rooms per night, overall occupancy will increase to 49.5%. Occupancy during the school year should gradually increase over the next couple of years to \u00b175%. Fall semester occupancy was 73.3% and the spring 2008 semester was 52.5%, after allocating 60 rooms for May. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 46 Michael J.

Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 41CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 Fall Semester Enrollment The residence halls have had fluctuating occupancy over the past six years with gradually increasing levels peaking when the College had to lease rooms from the Red Lion until the subject property and College Place were built in 2006. In 2006, the College closed the \u00b195 room Talkington Hall and is considering closing or selling Parrish Hall eliminating another 29 rooms. This would increase occupancy in College Place and Clearwater Halls. Enrollment has gradually been increasing over the past six years. The total enrollment includes the Coeur d'Alene, Idaho center with 367 in 2005, 358 in 2006 and 341 in 2007. Lewiston enrollmentwas 3,084 in 2005, 3,036 in 2006 and 3,271 in 2007. Overall FTE enrollment has increased \u00b11% annually over the last four years. In my opinion, a long-term vacancy and collection loss allowance of 30.0% would be reasonable for the subject property. This is equivalent to an occupancy rate of 95% for the fall semester, 75% for the spring semester and 25% for the summer months. Occupancy for the spring semester has always been a problem with a differential of up to 38% to 40% in 2002 and 2003 declining to 21% and 22% in 2006 and 2007. It is possible that spring enrollment will continue to increase, however, I have already projected a healthy increase in summer usage that will be hard to achieve in the next fewyears. In the following summary, I have projected stabilized occupancy of 70% in about two years. Expenses/NOI I have been furnished with the income and expenses for the subject property for the last 2-plus years and have included them in the Addenda. I have included professional management expenses at 5.0%, which is not currently being charged. Professional management fees for apartment projects are generally from 5% to 7%. A more competitive rate may be around 6%, however, with the changes taking place and the higher than normal vacancy rate, a rate of 5.0% appears reasonable. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 48 Michael J. Sprute, MAI ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 42CLEARWATER APARTMENTS COMPLETE APPRAISAL-SUMMARY REPORT As of April 8, 2008 Current real estate taxes are $78,972 based on a total assessed value of $4,254,571 including the main floor retail space. In my opinion, the assessed value for the subject portion of the project could be reduced because of the decreased occupancy projections. I have estimated real estate taxes at $54,000 based on an assessed value of $2,900,000. Personal property taxes are currently $5,262 based on a value of $283,434 and have been included at $5,300. Property and liability insurance has been estimated at 15\u00a2/sf or $5,150. Water/sewer/garbage and electricity was \u00b1$30,500 for the past twelve months and have been increased in the second and third years to account for the increased occupancy. Elevator maintenance was estimated at $1,900, telephone and internet service at $29,0000 and cable TV at $11,170 but have only been increased at 2.5% because they are more fixed and do not fluctuate with occupancy. Repairs and maintenance were less than \u00b1$3,000 for the past twelve months because the project is nearly new. I have used an allowance of 12\u00a2/sf or $4,120 for normal repairs and maintenance. Although there will be periodic replacement of some shorter life building components such as carpet and HVAC units, a replacement allowance has not been included. Buyers of residential rental property know that these costs will occur and the allowance is reflected in the overall capitalization rate used, since the comparable sales do not include any allowance. Typical salaries and wages would be for an on-site manager during half of the working day and a half-time maintenance/repair employee. I have allocated an expense of $24,000 for two part-timeemployees including some benefits allowance. I have included miscellaneous expenses of $2,400/year for audits, professional fees, etc. Direct Capitalization Direct capitalization converts the estimate of net annual income into an indication of value. Capitalization rates are derived from comparable sales of similar grade investment properties that appeal to the same level of investor as the subject property. The eight sales included had overall capitalization rates of 8.0%, 7.5%, 7.6%, 7.1%, 7.8%, 7.7%, 7.3%, and 7.3%, respectively. The most recent sale indicated the highest rate. Overall rates had been declining for the past few years but have begun to increase due to the changing economy and shortage of available money. The recent national housing crisis has caused many traditional lenders to reconsider the types of properties they are willing to lend on. Also, investors have turned to investments other than real estate, causing a further erosion of available money. In my opinion, these sales support an overall rate of 7% to 8% as reasonable in the Lewiston area. Rates for residential income property in the Kootenai County and Spokane County area have been closer to 7% with some below. For this analysis, I have used an overall capitalization rate of 7.50%. Below is a summary of the Income Approach. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 49 Michael J.

Consideration should be given to this approach because this is a special purpose, student housing facility that does not have any good comparable sales from which to derive a value indication. The sales used in the Sales ComparisonApproach were all of apartments in the university cities of Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington.The Effective Gross Profit Multiplier indication of $3,320,000 is higher than the Sales ComparisonApproach but lower than the Cost Approach. The income and expenses derived were based on current expenses for the most part and appear to be reasonable. The overall capitalization rate of 7.5% was bracketed by the sales used. In my opinion, this approach should be given equal weight with the other two approaches. The Sales Comparison Approach indication of $2,925,000 was derived by comparing recent sales of apartment complexes in the Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington area. This approach should be given supporting consideration in the final value estimate because the sales were not of college housing similar to the subject, although the analysis on a per bedroom basis was reasonably reflective of the subject facility. The price per unit indication of $85,000/unit or $2,720,000 and per square foot indication of $80/sf or $2,745,000 were on the high side of the adjusted range of the comparables but reasonably well supported. The Cost Approach indication of $3,745,000 is an estimate of the cost new including soft costs and developer's profit with an estimate of overall depreciation due primarily to the lower than typical occupancy levels compared to apartments. This approach should set the lower limit of value if the project is successful. The undepreciated cost should set the upper limit of value. In final analysis, I believe that all three approaches have some validity, however, the most weight should be given to the Income Approach indication. Therefore, it is my opinion that the estimated market value of the fee simple interest in the subject resident student housing facility \"As Is\" is: TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS . . . . $2,800,000 Including Fixtures and Equipment FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT ALLOCATION The value is allocated between real estate, furniture, fixtures, and equipment to comply with USPAP requirements. The real estate is identified as the building improvements, asphalt paving, concrete, landscaping, land, etc. The furniture, fixtures and equipment (F,F&E) are the common area furniture, beds, desks, wardrobe closets, refrigerators, microwaves, tables, chairs, etc. to furnish the complex for student housing. The total new value of the FF&E is \u00b1$285,000. I have allocated the same depreciation of 30% to arrive at a current value of $200,000. The allocation between real estate and fixtures is shown below. 402-418 Main Street, Lewiston Appraisal Group NorthWest Page 51 Michael J.

Based upon the reasons outlined in our letter of July 16, 2008, as well as additional information provided herein, we cannot accept your offer price if $2.8 million. As a counter proposal, we offer the following three alternat ives. These alternatives are significant compromises on our part; and accordingly, they are offered in good faith, as a potential solution to the issues we have expressed to you in all of our meetings and correspondences to date. Purchase of Clearwater Hall Residential Space We will accept an \"as is\" purchase price of not less than $3.8 million for the residential space only; or Purchase of Entire Facility Including First Floor Commercial Space We will accept an \"as is\" purchase price of $5.1 million for t he entire facility including the first floor commercial space; or Master Lease of Residential Space We will accept a master lease for the residential space as follows. The lease rate shall be $28,000 paid monthly each and every calendar month. The lease rate shall be trip le net, and all taxes, utilities, insurance, telephone, cable and other related expenses specific to t he residential space, shall be paid by the LCSC. The term of the lease shall be five years, with three successi ve five year options to renew at the then-fair market lease rate. Justification for Count er Offer Purchase Price Low student occupancy rates comprise the sole reason for t he discounted valuation of the Sprute appraisal. The appraisal acknowledges that the current Management Agreem ent actually diminishes the value of the property; and the appraisal gives inadequate considerat ion to the fact that LCSC is capab le of fully utilizing this space. The Sprute appraisal assumes that LCSC will experience little to no future growth. Accordingly, 64 rooms are attributed value, while the remaining 53 rooms are r endered worthless due to low occupancy rates. LCSC has consistently stated that this property must be va lued at its actual value to the college, as if the college were the owner. The Sprute appraisal does not reflect such a situation. In fact, if LCSC were to own the property, its pro rata share of property taxes should be deducted from expenses; and accordingly, $55,360 annually at a capitalization rate of 7.5%, or $738,133, mu st be added back to Income Approach valuation. Via e-mail, we have sent to you the December 17, 2007 Appraisal of Clearwater Hall, as performed by Lembeck Appraisal & Consulting, Inc. of Spokane, WA for KeyBank Na tional Association. Typical of appraisals performed for ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 50 banks, the bank instructed the appraiser to view the proper ty from a conservative perspective. You will find this document to be considerably more thorou gh than the appraisal performed by Sprute. The following is our comparison of the two appraisals. Pl ease note that both appraisers included the property taxes as expenses negatively affecting income. We have re-adjus ted the value as a separate li ne item notation, using each appraiser's respective capitalization rate.

The two appraisals, collectively, provide more than enough data to arrive at a fair price. Both appr aisals utilize the same basic three approaches to value. And both appraisers admit that you cannot base value on any one particular number. Our counter-offer of $3.8 million is equally supported by both of these appraisals. First we arrive at a base value of $3.5 million, by applying the following two formulas: ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 51 Valuation Formula One: The Lembeck appraisal values the residential portion at $3,777,556 using their \"Income Approach Without Management Contract\" value, adjusted for property taxes. We feel that it is approp riate to use the \"Without Management Contract\" value because this best reflects an LCSC ownership situation. The same is true with regard to deducting pro rata property taxes from the expenses. The Sprute appraisal, adjusted fo r property taxes, indicates an Income Approach value of $3,218,133. If you simply average these two appraisals, you arrive at a value of $3,497,845. This supports the base value of our counter offer, and it ut ilizes only the conservative income approaches. Lembeck Income Approach w/o Management Agreement Adj. Taxes $3,777,556 Sprute Income Approach Adj. Taxes $3,218,133 Average of Two Approaches $3,497,845 Valuation Formula Two: The Sprute appraisal arrives at one blended appraisal va lue, using a combination of Income Approach, Sales Approach and Cost Approach. If we accept the ratios us ed by Sprute, of 38.8%, 30.6% and 30.6% respectively, and apply these ratio's to each approach, equally averaging bot h appraisals, we arrive at a value of $3,500,000, once again, supporting the base value of our counter offer. Income Approach Valuation from Valuation Formula One $3,479,845 Avg. of Lembeck Cost Value & Sp rute Cost Value $3,872,348 Avg. of Lembeck Sales Value & Sprute Sales Value $3,212,500 Value Weighted 38.8% / 30.6% / 30.6% as used by Sprute $3,500,000 Finally, to this base value of $3.5 million, we must add back additional value to reflect the fact that this property provides LCSC with excellent growth potential. This gr owth has already been projected by the college; however, neither appraisal gave consideration to this fact. Clearwater Hall is not a 64 room facility. It has 117 rooms, which LCSC expects to fill in the near future. Using the Sprute appraisal (page 50) value analysis based solely on income, the following chart accepts all expense assumptions, and calculates values under reasonable short term growth scenarios. ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 52 Current Occupancy 75% Sem 1&2 10% The Sprute appraisal's Income Approach value of $2,4 80,000 assumes that Clearwater Hall will never surpass 70% occupancy. This assumption is unreasonable and absurd. As you can see, The Sprute Model returns a value $2 million higher at 100% occupancy during the non-summer academ ic year, and nearly $3 million higher when property taxes are no longer paid. Based upon this information, we feel that we can reasonab ly and logically provide an argument which supports a total purchase price well over $4 million for the residential portion of this property. In the interest of quickly resolving our differences with the college, and endi ng the continuing and mounting losses generated by this project, we are willing to value the property's ability to meet the college 's future space requirements at only $300,000. Base Value Derived From Appraisals: Va luation Formulas 1 & 2 Noted Above $3,500,000 Value Added for Consideration of Property's Ability to Meet Future Growth $ 300,000 TOTAL COUNTER OFFER TO PURCH ASE RESIDENCES $3,800,000 ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 53 I hope we can both agree that it would be grossly unfair to set the college's purchase price at a deeply discounted value, solely because the college itself has failed to main tain occupancy rates, and further failed to honor its own representations. Had LCSC been capable of simply produci ng 53 additional students as renters, these residences would now be worth $4.6 million on the open market, and $5.3 million to the college. Please give careful consideration to our second alternative noted above, as this price fo r purchasing the entire facility is very well supported by the appraisals. We have provided the Master Lease alternative as a viable opt ion, in the event that we cannot consummate a sale. This would be our \"last resort\" means of solving our curr ent issues with LCSC, prior to initiating litigation and beginning the process of converti ng the building into a new use. Once again, we ask you to consider that our company has, as of today, invested $6,323,170 in this project. And we did so, based upon the projections, promises and representat ions of Lewis-Clark State College. This counter proposal to your offer constitutes a significant compromise on our part, and it offers you an opportunity to secure this property at an outstanding value, especially given its ability to generate prof itability for the college. As time is critical, both in terms of your August board meeting, and in terms of the approaching Fall semester, we would appreciate your prompt reply. Respectfully, Fred M.

The subject property is Clearwater Hall, a four-story, mixed-use facility, which comprises retail space on the main floor and student-oriented housing in the upper levels. The student housing portion contains 117 bedrooms in 32 units. Based on our investigation and analysis, and subject to the assumptions and limiting conditions contained within this report, we are of the opinion that the market value of the leased fee interest in the subject property is as follows: VALUESCENARIO EFFECTIVEDATE VALUECONCLUSION Hypothetical Leased Fee Value Without Management Agreement As Is: December 6, 2007 $4,910,000 Upon Stabilization: October 6, 2009 $5,200,000 Leased Fee Value With Management Agreement As Is: December 6, 2007 $4,510,000 Upon Stabilization: October 6, 2009 $4,800,000 As will be discussed later in the report, the stabilized value of the subject is less than the value concluded in the previous appraisal of the subject that was completed for its construction loan. Please see the Property History on page 16 of this report for a discussion of the influences that led to this reduction in value. The data and analysis leading to the conclusion are summarized in the attached self-contained appraisal report. This report was prepared in conformance with the requirements of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, in addition to those of KeyBank National Association. Sincerely, Justin L.

The client has asked for an \"as is\" market value of the subject, assuming operation without the current management agreement between the subject owners and Lewis- Clark State College. Therefore, for the purposes of this value, it is a hypothetical condition of this report that the subject is operating without the aforementioned management agreement. The client has also requested the \"as is\" value of the subject with the existing management agreement. Therefore, after the reconciliation, the \"as is\" value of the subject will be analyzed under the existing management agreement. Thus the preceding hypothetical condition will not be in effect during the later analysis. GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS 1. No responsibility is assumed for the legal description or matters involving legal or title considerations. Title to the property is assumed to be good and marketable unless otherwise stated. 2. The property is appraised free and clear of any or all liens or encumbrances, unless otherwise stated. 3. Responsible ownership and competent management are assumed, unless otherwise stated. 4. The information furnished by others is believed to be reliable, but no warranty is given for its accuracy. 5. The appraiser has made no engineering survey of the property and assumes no responsibility for such matters. Any maps, plans and photographs included in this report are for illustrative purposes only. 6. It is assumed there are no hidden or unapparent conditions of the property, subsoil or structures that render it more or less valuable. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or for obtaining the engineering studies that may be required to discover them. Subsurface rights, e.g. mineral or oil rights, were not considered in this report. 7. It is assumed the property is in full compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations and laws unless the lack of compliance is stated, described, and considered in the appraisal report. 8. It is assumed that the property conforms to all applicable zoning and use regulations and restrictions unless a nonconformity has been identified, described and considered in the appraisal report. 9. It is assumed that all required licenses, certificates of occupancy, consents, and other legislative or administrative authority from any local, state, or national government or ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 65Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 12private entity or organization have been or can be obtained or renewed for any use on which the value estimate contained in this report is based. 10. It is assumed the utilization of the land and improvements is within the subject property boundaries and there is no encroachment or trespass unless otherwise stated. 11. Unless otherwise stated in this report, the existence of hazardous materials, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser. The appraiser has no knowledge of the existence of such materials on or in the property.The appraiser, however, is not qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, and other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property. The value estimated is predicated on the assumption that there is no such material on or in the property that would adversely affect its use or value. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or for any expertise or engineering knowledge required to discover them.The intended user is urged to retain an expert in this field, if desired. 12. Any allocation of total value estimated in this report between land, improvements, or any other fractional part or interest applies only under the stated program of utilization, and is invalidated if used separately or in conjunction with any other appraisal. 13. Possession of this report, or a copy thereof, does not carry with it the right of publication. 14. The appraiser, by reason of this appraisal, is not required to give further consultation or testimony or to be in attendance in court with reference to the property in question unless arrangements have been previously made. 15. Neither all nor any part of the contents of this report (especially any conclusions as to value, the identity of the appraiser, or the firm with which the appraiser is connected) shall be disseminated to the public through advertising, public relations, news, sales, or other media without the prior written consent and approval of the appraiser. 16. Any value estimates provided in the report apply to the entire property, and any proration or division of the total into fractional interests will invalidate the value estimate, unless such proration or division of interests has been set forth in the report. 17. Any proposed improvements are assumed to have been completed unless otherwise stipulated; any construction is assumed to conform with the building plans referenced in the report. 18. Any construction, alterations or repairs upon which the appraised value is contingent are assumed to be completed in a workmanlike manner. 19. The forecasts, projections, or operating estimates contained herein are based on current market conditions, anticipated short-term supply and demand factors, and a continued stable economy. These forecasts are, therefore, subject to changes with future conditions. 20. Disclosure of the contents of this report is governed by the Bylaws and Regulations of the Appraisal Institute.

The appraiser has not made a specific compliance survey and analysis of the subject property to determine whether it is conformity with the various detailed requirements of the ADA. It is possible that a compliance survey of the subject property and a detailed analysis of the requirements of the ADA may reveal that the subject property is not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of the act. 22. This appraisal report is prepared for the sole and exclusive use of the appraiser's client, K KeyBank National Association.No third parties are authorized to rely upon this report without the express written consent of the appraiser. 23. Provision of an Insurable Value by the appraiser does not change the intended user or the intended purpose of the appraisal. The appraiser assumes no liability for the Insurable Value estimate provided and does not guarantee that any estimate or opinion will result in the subject property being fully insured for any possible loss that may be sustained. The appraiser recommends that an insurance professional be consulted. The Insurable Value estimate may not be a reliable indication of replacement or reproduction cost for any date other than the effective date of this appraisal due to changing costs of labor and materials and due to changing building codes and governmental regulations and requirements.

LEGAL DESCRIPTION A lengthy metes and bounds legal description of the subject property is included in the addenda of this report. DATE OF INSPECTION Jeffrey D. Lembeck and Justin L. Stout inspected the subject property on various dates in December 2007. The formal inspection of the subject property was conducted on December 6, 2007. DATE OF VALUATION The property is valued as of December 6, 2007. DATE OF REPORT The date of the report is December 17, 2007. PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL The purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the market value of the leased fee interest in the subject property with its existing management agreement in place and assuming operation without the management agreement. INTENDED USE OF THE APPRAISAL The intended use of the appraisal is to provide the client, KeyBank National Association, with an updated value of the subject property for monitoring purposes. PROPERTY RIGHTS APPRAISED This analysis will lead to an opinion of the market value of the leased feeinterest in the subject property. Leased Fee Interest - An ownership interest held by a landlord with the rights of use and occupancy conveyed by lease to others. The rights of lessor (the leased fee owner) and the lessee are specified by contract terms contained within the lease.1 1 Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed. 2002, pg. 161. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 68Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 15Fee Simple Estate - Absolute ownership unencumbered by any other interest or estate, subject only to the limitations imposed by the governmental powers of taxation, eminent domain, police powers, and escheat.2 The right of use and occupancy for the subject property is conveyed by lease to the tenants; as such, the report will conclude to a leased fee value. The client has asked for the \"as is\" market value of the leased fee interest in the subject property. However, the subject is not yet stabilized, and therefore a stabilized value will be concluded first, followed by the \"as is\" value. DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) Buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests; (3) A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.3 SCOPE OF THE APPRAISAL The scope of the appraisal included: xInspection of the subject property, subject neighborhood and all comparable properties used in the report; xreview and analysis of all subject information included in the report and addenda; xresearch, confirmation and analysis of sale comparables with the aid of County records, TRW Real Estate Information Services, and other sources; xuse of the Cost, Sales Comparison, and Income Approaches in valuing the property, and; xpreparing this written appraisal report in a self-contained report format. 2 Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed. 2002, pg. 113. 3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRS), 12 CFR Part 225; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 12 CFR Part 323; National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), 12 CFR Part 722; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), 12 CFR 34.42(f); Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), 12 CFR 564.2(f); and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), 12 CFR Part 1608.

THREE-YEAR OWNERSHIP AND SALES HISTORY OF THE SUBJECT The subject property is currently owned by Clearwater Historic Development, LLC, which purchased the property in February 2005 for $250,000 from S. Griffin Construction, Inc. The land component of this sale will be analyzed in the land valuation section of this report. The property was reportedly not being marketed at the time of sale. At the time of this sale, the facility comprised only a three-story brick building that was originally constructed in 1910, which was in \"shell\" condition, prior to being completely gutted, remodeled, and expanded to the east with a four-story building, all of which was completed after the sale. We are aware of no other sales, listings, or offers involving the subject over the past three years. It should be noted that a representative for Lewis-Clark State College reported that the college was assessing the possibility of purchasing the subject. However, they would need the approval of the State Board of Education. SUBJECT HISTORY As stated earlier, we previously appraised the subject property for the purposes of its construction loan, which resulted in a higher stabilized value than is concluded in this report. The prior appraisal was predicated on assumptions put forth by Lewis-Clark State College that did not come to fruition after the completion of the subject property. In order to provide a better understanding of the progression of the subject property to its current state, it is helpful to consider the following history of the subject. x Project Development History - When the subject project was initially conceived, there was reportedly a large supply of pent-up demand for student housing. At the time of development, Dr. Ron Smith, the former Vice President for Administrative Services at Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC), stated the college had a contract with the nearby Red Lion hotel to house 59 of the overflow of students that could not be accommodated in residence halls on campus, which were fully occupied. This contract would be terminated at the end of May 2006. The three residence halls on campus were reportedly fully occupied with approximately 205 students. Dr. Smith reported that there was typically a waiting list for these lodgings in the summer and when the contract with the Red Lion terminates, the college anticipated there would be over 160 students on the waiting list for on-campus housing. Additionally, Karen Morscheck, Director of Residence Life at LCSC stated that lots of groups apply to LCSC for summer stays, but given the limited on-campus housing, these groups couldn't be facilitated. As an inducement to build the subject project, Dr. Smith drafted a letter of intent between the subject's developer and LCSC to enter into a management agreement, in which LCSC agreed to fill the subject's residence units and College Place (an 88-bedroom, student-oriented facility that was to be constructed and completed at the same time as the subject) prior to allowing students to reside in any other LCSC owned or managed residence facility. T Thus LCSC agreed to fill the subject's 117 bedrooms and the 88 bedrooms at College Place before filling its own residence halls on campus. However, this commitment never materialized, as it is not included in the current management agreement. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 70Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 17Dr. Smith further stated that peer institutions that are similar to LCSC typically use 12% of their total enrollment as a benchmark for programming the number of beds needed for on-campus housing. Therefore Dr. Smith surmised that 12% of LCSC's reported 3,500 students would equate to a need of 420 beds. According to Dr. Smith, LCSC had about 205 beds on campus, thus falling well short of the 12% benchmark and indicating a need for over 200 additional beds. Since the subject and College Place would accommodate a combined total of 205 beds, both projects were undertaken and completed in August 2006. x Present Project Status - The subject project is currently approximately 75% occupied. According to the subject history, this occupancy rate is typical for the nine-month school year. During the summer term, however, the occupancy rate drops to about 8%. The experience of College Place, which is also at a present occupancy rate of 75%, has reportedly been the same. We spoke with one of the owners of College Place, Bill Lawson, who stated they were having serious vacancy and absorption problems that they have yet to work out. Mr. Lawson said the project is basically dead in the summer, and they have to \"make it up\" during the nine-month school year. They start the school year at 85% to 90% occupancy, but by the first semester they are down to only 60% occupancy. oWe spoke with Kent Kinyon (208-792-2202), Controller for Lewis-Clark State College, who said that during the 2005/2006 school year, there was excessive demand for student housing, as students were relegated to the Red Lion hotel for overflow housing. Since that time, enrollment has increased at LSCS, however there has been a change in the demographics related to the student body. While typical colleges mainly have traditional four-year students between the ages of 18 and 22, LCSC has experienced a combination of a net increase in older, non-traditional students and a slight decrease in enrollment for traditional four-year students. This has a magnified effect upon residence halls, since they historically comprise younger students that are either freshmen or sophomores. Additionally, LCSC has experienced a lower retention rate for students living in residence halls, compared to the general student population. A possible reason for this is the younger students are increasingly seeking out traditional apartment housing, as opposed to residence halls. Another possible explanation is that, due to a favorable economy in the Lewiston area, these younger student's are opting to quit or put on hold their pursuit of a college degree and enter the workforce. As a result, there are fewer students attending LCSC, which leads to a decreasing number of students seeking student housing. oWe spoke with Karan Morscheck (208-792-2259), Director of Student Life at LCSC, who related they have closed Talkington Hall, a residence hall on campus. Ms. Morscheck said Clark Hall had 69 beds occupied out of 78, which are used for athletes only, and Parrish Hall has 19 beds occupied out of 29, which is occupied by upper-classman on the honor roll. As such, housing on campus is very limited, and the majority of the students requiring housing are accommodated at the subject, Clearwater Hall, and College Place. Ms. Morscheck related that while enrollment at the subject is at around 90 beds during the nine-month school year, it drops to about 9 or 10 during the summer term, even though LCSC marketed the space through several different outlets. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 71Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 18xProject's Future Outlook - Mr. Kinyon stated it is LSCS's goal to increase enrollment of traditional four-year students and he believes the trend line for the traditional student will increase in the future. As part of LCSC's commitment to increasing enrollment of this demographic, they will be constructing a $15 Million addition for their prestigious nursing program, which is reportedly highly regarded. This expansion, which is expected to be completed by Fall 2009, will enable the college to admit more students to its nursing program. Their nursing program is a baccalaureate program, from which they anticipate an increase of traditional four- year students. As a result, this will be a source of additional student demand for both residence halls (Clearwater Hall and College Place). oAdditionally, we spoke with Howard Erdman (208-792-2456), Director of Institutional Planning, Research and Assessment at LCSC. The following information was relayed during our conversation. Enrollment of full-time students at LCSC has been steady over the past seven years, while total student enrollment has been trending upward, as shown in the following table. LCSC Fall Semester Total Enrollment Year: 2001 2002 2003 2004 Semester Total Enrollment students in residence housing are freshmen and sophomores, and therefore, the college is targeting these younger, traditional students. As shown in the above chart, total enrollment in 2007 increased by 6%. This increase was partly due to an increase in freshmen. The following table displays the freshman enrollment over the past seven years. LCSC Freshman Enrollment History Year: 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2007 Enrollment 2007 shown, a 15% increase in freshman was experienced in 2007. This is reportedly a direct result of the college targeting smaller school districts in the region that have small graduating classes. The college plans to continue their efforts to target these smaller school districts that are purportedly not courted by other colleges and universities. It should be noted that the increase in 2003 (as shown in both tables above) was due to an atypically large high school graduating class. In addition, virtually all of the college's international students are accommodated in residence halls. The following table reflects past international enrollment for LCSC. LCSC International Enrollment History Year: 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Int'l Students: 78 79 94 98 115 132 - 1.3% 16.0% 4.1% 14.8% 12.9% 7.7%LCSC International Enrollment 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Int'l Students: 78 79 94 98 115 132 1.3% 16.0% 4.1% 14.8% 12.9% 7.7% - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 72Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 19As shown, the enrollment of international students has been rising steadily. However, the 2001 enrollment, as well as a few years that follow, is reportedly atypically low due to the terrorist attack in September 2001. Also, 100 students from Nepal will be enrolling at LCSC in Fall 2008, as LCSC has a strong enrollment of Nepalese. Therefore, these additional 100 students would be expected to be housed in the residence halls, and in turn, increasing occupancy rates. x Conclusion - It is evident that the demand for student housing that was anticipated prior to construction of the subject did not materialize. A possible reason for the lower demand is a change in the demographics at LCSC and a reduction in retention rates for students housed in residence halls. Also, there are approximately 88 students still being lodged in on-campus housing, further impacting the occupancy rate for the off-campus residence halls (the subject and College Place). If these 88 students were to be housed in off-campus residence halls, there would still not be enough student demand to maintain an appropriate occupancy rate during the summer term. The college does appear to be increasing its efforts to increase traditional student enrollment that would typically require student housing. These efforts include focusing on smaller school districts in the region that have smaller high school graduating classes. The college will also be completing a $15 Million expansion to accommodate more students in its nursing program in Fall 2009, which mainly comprises traditional four-year students. Additionally, they are projecting an increase of at least 100 international students in Fall 2009, which will all likely require student housing. Thus, the aforementioned plans should positively impact the future enrollment of LCSC, and in turn, the subject's occupancy; however it will not be occurring in the near term and it is unknown when the full impact of their efforts will be received. MARKETING/EXPOSURE PERIOD Marketing Time - an estimate of the amount of time it might take to sell an interest in real property at its estimated market value during the period immediately after the effective date of the appraisal; the anticipated time required to expose the property to a pool of prospective purchasers and to allow appropriate time for negotiation, the exercise of due diligence, and the consummation of a sale at a price supportable by concurrent market conditions.4 Exposure Time - the estimated length of time the property interest being appraised would have been offered on the market prior to the hypothetical consummation of a sale at market value on the effective date of the appraisal; a retrospective estimate based on an analysis of past events assuming a competitive and open market. Exposure time is always presumed to occur prior to the effective date of the appraisal.5 In this instance, marketing time and exposure time are judged to be equivalent. According to the Korpacz Real Estate Investor Survey, the average marketing time for the \"National Strip Shopping Center Market\" is 6.25 months. Additionally, the average marketing time for the \"National Apartment Market\" is 5.65 months. Among the improved apartment sales, Clarke Terrace was listed for 2 months prior to selling. Considering the subject's 4 The Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed., 2002. 5 Ibid.

SIZE AND SHAPE The subject is an irregular site that comprises three contiguous parcels, as shown in the plat map above (the subject site is highlighted in yellow). The entire site is approximately 0.85 acres, or 36,984 SF. However, due to the severe slope on the southern border of the subject site, only the northern section of the parcels is usable. This usable portion is approximately 0.32 acres, or 14,130 SF. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 76Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 40FRONTAGE/EXPOSURE The subject is a corner site with frontage along Main Street and 5th Street. Main Street is a one-way road that is the eastbound portion of Lewiston's downtown couplet. The westbound portion of this couplet is \"D\" Street, which is located one block north of Main Street. The subject site has approximately 198' of frontage along the south side of Main Street and about 237' of frontage along the west side of 5th Street. The subject has ground-floor retail space and student-oriented housing in the upper levels, therefore, its exposure is considered good since it is located along Main Street, a major arterial in the historic district of Lewiston's central business district, and along 5th Street, which provides access to Lewis-Clark State College, one-half mile to the south. Additionally, the subject site is located at a signalized intersection. ACCESS Regional and local access to the site is good. The subject can be accessed via Main Street, which is also known as Highway 12, but is Main Street while in the city limits of Lewiston.Main Street accesses the city of Clarkston to the west and intersects with Twenty-first Street to the east, which provides access to US Routes 12, 95, and 195. These routes serve as the major north/south and east/west highways in southern Washington and south-central Idaho. The subject is easily accessed both regionally and locally. INGRESS/EGRESS The subject site has frontage on Main Street, a paved one-way road with two eastbound lanes, and 5th Street, a paved two-way road. The only area of vehicular ingress/egress to the subject property is the southeast corner of the site along the west side of 5 th Street, which is used to access the subject's trash receptacle. EASEMENTS/ENCROACHMENTS The title report by Land Title of Nez Perce County, dated January 6, 2006, did not indicate any adverse easements, or restrictions. No obvious easements or encroachments were observed during the inspection of the site. Typical utility easements are presumed to exist. ADJACENT USES North: An older two-story brick building in average condition at the northwest corner of Main Street and 5th Street. This building is occupied by the Lewis-Clark State College Center for Arts and History. This building shares a common wall with the four-story building to the west, across the street to the north of the subject's existing building. This is the Butler Building, which was recently renovated and comprises Moxie, a full service salon, on the main level and private residences on the upper levels. South: The Garden City Apartments; an older multi-family apartment complex that comprises three buildings in average condition. This apartment complex is situated atop the hillside directly behind the subject. East: Across 5th Street is the Town Square Mall; a combination of two buildings that comprise four levels of retail and office use. The mall ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 77Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 41was constructed in 1892 and was remodeled in the early 1980's. The 45,735 SF facility is in average condition. West: A block of buildings in fair to average condition that share common walls. TOPOGRAPHY/DRAINAGE As mentioned, there is a severe upward slope from north to south along the southern border of the subject site. Thus only the northern section of the site is considered usable.The severity of this slope is illustrated in the topographic survey below. The northern section of the site is generally level and at street grade. There were no areas of standing water at the time of the inspection, and the subject property appears to have adequate drainage. UTILITIES Utilities available to the subject property include: Utility Purveyor Contact Water: City 800-227-9187 All typical utilities are available in the subject's neighborhood with City supplied water, sewer, and garbage.

The facility comprises a three- story brick building that was originally constructed in 1910 and was completely gutted and remodeled in 2006, in addition to an expansion to the east with a four-story building. The four-story expansion is of concrete construction on the main level and wood-frame on the upper levels, with a brick veneer exterior. The retail space is divided into four bays with bay depths of 60' to 70'.However, it would be possible to divide this space into more, or fewer bays, depending upon tenant demand. The subject's student-oriented housing portion has 32 units that comprise 117 bedrooms, each furnished with a loft-able bed, an armoire, and a desk and chair. The upper levels is accessed via an elevator, in addition to an interior stairwell. Each unit has a living room/kitchen area equipped with a refrigerator, kitchen sink, dining table with chairs, sofa, coffee table, and chair.The majority of the units have one bathroom with a shower and toilet, and a sink located just outside the bathroom. All the units are accessed via interior corridors. Additionally, the facility has common laundry, a study room, and storage rooms.

The retail bays will each have an individual gas forced air package system. Water Heaters: The residential portion of the facility has a central gas water heater, while the retail bays will each have individual water heaters. Plumbing: Kitchens are equipped with a refrigerator and basin sink. The majority of the living units have one bathroom with a shower and toilet that has a sink located just outside the bathroom. A laundry room equipped with washers and dryers is located on the second level, in addition to a common area unisex restroom with one toilet and sink. Janitorial rooms are located on all the upper levels. Electrical: Adequate outlets and lighting. The retail bays are individually metered. Elevator: One, with four stops. Fire Protection: Wet sprinkler system. Other Parking: The subject facility does not include on-site parking, however, this does not appear to be a negative influence upon the property, given that its tenants are students. With the subject's proximity to the campus of LCSC and its location in Lewiston's central business district, parking does not appear to be a significant need, and is therefore not considered a negative pressure upon the subject facility. Also, student tenants are reportedly allowed to use the city parking lots in the immediate vicinity of the subject, free of charge. Additionally, the city of Lewiston has a transit system that runs along 5th Street, in front of the subject and up to LCSC, on the hour. Thus, parking does not appear to be a problem for the subject's student tenants . Special Features: There is a bicycle stall and a courtyard on the south side of the new building. IMPROVEMENTS CONCLUSION The subject facility is in excellent condition, as the western building was completely gutted and rebuilt and the new addition, contiguous to the east, is newly built. As such, the improvements have no items of deferred maintenance. Additionally, the improvements seem to be well designed for their intended use and no functional obsolescence appears to exist. Overall, the subject is an attractive mixed-use facility in Lewiston's \"downtown,\" with mostly older buildings in the subject's immediate vicinity.

Revenue is disbursed to other municipal authorities from the county. By statute, real property is assessed at 100% of market value (although in practice, assessments are generally conservative), and re-valuation occurs at least once, by physical inspection, every five years. Values can also be changed annually, between inspections, by a trending process.Assessment notices are mailed in May, and annual tax bills are mailed on the fourth Monday in November. The first half is due in December, and the second half is due the following June. The real estate taxes for the subject are summarized below: Tax Account No.: RP representatives of Nez Perce County Treasurer's Office, delinquent taxes are currently owing for the subject, which total $887.26, plus interest and penalties. Additionally, a one-time occupancy tax of $18,241.66, plus interest and penalties, is also owing. As shown in the table below, the 2007 tax rates are the lowest in the past five years, as tax rates have been trending downward.

The four criteria the highest and best use must meet are legal permissibility, physical possibility, financial feasibility, and maximum productivity.\"6 AS IF VACANT Legally Permissible - The primary legal restriction affecting the use of the subject site is its zoning designation. The subject parcel is zoned C-4, General Commercial, by the City of Lewiston. Uses permitted in the C-4 zone include, but are not limited to, business or professional offices, eating or drinking establishments, multi-family residential uses not on the ground floor of a building, personal services, retail sales and service, and financial institutions. This zone is in accordance with surrounding zones and uses and appears to be commensurate to the subject's current improvements. Physically Possible - The subject site comprises three contiguous parcels, which total 0.85 acres, or 36,984 SF. However, due to the severely sloping hillside that takes up the southern border of the subject site, only the northern section of the parcels is usable. This usable portion is approximately 0.32 acres, or 14,130 SF. All city utilities are available to the site. Soils are of a consistency that should support substantial development, as evidenced by the current improvements in the subject's immediate area. These factors are conducive to the construction of a multi-story building on the site, which would be a likely use. Financially Feasible - Despite the low vacancy rates, new apartment construction is only marginally feasible in the Lewiston-Clarkston area. Most types of new apartment construction in this area are currently possible at approximately $60.00 to $65.00 per square foot. Assuming an average unit size of 900 square foot, the total construction costs are ranging from roughly $55,000 to $60,000/unit. Adding land acquisition costs in the $5,000 to $10,000 per unit range, total development costs are near $60,000 to $70,000 per unit. The bulk of newly constructed apartment complexes in Eastern Washington/Northern Idaho are selling for prices in the range of $65,000 to $70,000 per unit. Assuming some relationship between cost and value, the potential profit is about $11,000 per unit, at best. This implies a potential profit in the range of -5% to 17%, with no guarantee of achieving a rate toward the upper end of the range. This return is sufficient to warrant new development, although, new market rate apartment development has been extremely minimal in the Lewiston-Clarkston area. However, the current improvement is a mixed-use facility and the subject site is not a typical apartment site. Additionally, the zoning does not require the off-street parking required by typical apartment sites. Also, the tenants that occupy the subject's living units do not have the same parking requirements of typical apartment dwellers. Therefore, cost savings can be realized via the lower price of the subject's land in a central business district, compared to typical apartment land. Overall, apartment development does not appear to be feasible at this time. Additionally, there is no new development occurring in the subject's immediate area. 6 Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed. 2002. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 89Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 53Maximally Productive - Developers have continued to build new apartments in Eastern Washington/Western Idaho despite current economic conditions, with the belief that market conditions will eventually improve to the point of providing a sufficient future return on investment to justify construction today. In addition, a number of multi-family developers have continued to build \"niche\" properties, such as retirement apartments, high-end complexes, and affordable housing projects. The developers of these projects have continued to acquire and develop multi-family land, despite the current state of the market. The subject facility, as a student-oriented complex, could be considered a \"niche\" property. Also, developers have built speculative retail properties in Lewiston, albeit along its main retail corridor in the eastern section of the city. However, Lewiston's central business district is reportedly experiencing some rejuvenation. At least four properties in the CBD have been purchased and renovated over the past few years, indicating the possible viability of new development. The subject's retail space is superior to the typical retail space in downtown Lewiston. However, new development in Lewiston is occurring in the southeast section of the city, along 21 St Street/Thain St. The subject site has many positive locational characteristics, due to its proximity to Lewiston's CBD and the campus of Lewis-Clark State College, in addition to medical and other services. However, development does not appear to be feasible at this time.Considering the preceding discussion, the highest and best use of the subject site as if vacant would be to develop a retail/office facility, with possible multi-family living units in the upper levels, in accordance with zoning standards, when the market permits. AS IMPROVED There are essentially three possible options with regard to the Highest and Best Use of a property as improved: 1) improve or expand the existing use, 2) demolish the existing improvements in favor of a more profitable use, or 3) continue the existing use. Option #1: Expansion of the subject's improvements is not a viable option, as the current structure covers the majority of the usable site area. Additionally, further additions in the form of increased stories, does not appear viable at this time. Option #2: As will be shown later, the market value of the subject is near five million dollars. Considering the subject's estimated land value is $92,000, the existing improvements add significantly to the value of the subject, eliminating the viability of demolition. Option #3: The continuation of the current improvements appears to be the most productive use of the property, based on the obvious contributory value of the improvements. Therefore, the current improvements are representative of the highest and best use of the site, as improved. It should be noted that if the subject continues to suffer from high vacancy rates, an alternative use of the upper levels of the subject property could be as an elderly care facility. This type of facility would not likely require extensive parking and the existing design would potentially be a practical layout for such a use. We are not familiar with specific code regulations regarding a use of this type, therefore further research would be required if such a use is being considered. Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this assignment. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 90Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 54VALUATION In the valuation analysis that follows, the subject will be valued using the three traditional approaches to value. Each of these approaches is further described below. COST APPROACH A set of procedures through which a value indication is derived for the fee simple interest in a property by estimating the current cost to construct a reproduction of (or replacement for) the existing structure, including an entrepreneurial incentive, deducting depreciation from the total cost, and adding the estimated land value. Adjustments may then be made to the indicated fee simple value of the subject property to reflect the value of the property interest being appraised. 7 SALES COMPARISON APPROACH A set of procedures in which a value indication is derived by comparing the property being appraised to similar properties that have been sold recently, then applying appropriate units of comparison and making adjustments to the sale prices of the comparables based on the elements of comparison. The sales comparison approach may be used to value improved properties, vacant land, or land being considered as though vacant; it is the most common and preferred method of land valuation when an adequate supply of comparable sales are available. 8 INCOME CAPITALIZATION APPROACH A set of procedures through which an appraiser derives a value indication for an income- producing property by converting its anticipated benefits (cash flows and reversion) into property value. This conversion can be accomplished in two ways. One year's income expectancy can be capitalized at a market-derived capitalization rate or at a capitalization rate that reflects a specified income pattern, return on investment, and change in the value of the investment. Alternatively, the annual cash flows for the holding period and the reversion can be discounted at a specified yield rate. 9 The following analysis begins with the Cost Approach, and is followed by the Sales Comparison and Income Approaches to value. The three approaches are seldom completely independent, and the quality and quantity of the data used within each approach will be considered in reconciling to a final value at the end of the analysis. These approaches will be used to arrive at a stabilized value for the subject as though it were being operated without its current management agreement. Following the reconciliation, the \"as is\" value will be addressed, followed by an analysis of the subject's value under its existing management agreement. 7The Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal , 4th Edition, 2002. 8ibid. 9ibid.

In this case, none of the sales required adjustments for terms of sale. The next adjustment is for market conditions at time of sale. The best evidence for an appropriate adjustment for market conditions (time) is by an analysis of the sale/resale of the same property.None of the land sales used in this analysis was useful for extracting such an adjustment.Considering the lack of market data, in addition to the subject's location, we have applied a moderate annual appreciation rate of 3%/yr to the land sale comparables used in this analysis. DISCUSSION OF LAND SALES The comparable sales analyzed reflect value rates ranging from $4.05/SF to $6.75/SF, with an average of $6.03/SF after adjusting for market conditions. Sale 4 ($4.05/SF) marks the lower end of the range for the comparables. The site was purchased for use as a storage lot for inventory of a nearby auto sales company. This site is located in downtown Lewiston and has inferior exposure and access compared to the subject. This sale is a low indicator for the subject. Sale 5 ($6.64/SF) was the acquisition of a parking lot for a nearby business. This sale is situated a few blocks north of the subject and has inferior exposure, but is superior in size to the subject. This sale is a good indicator of value for the subject. Sale 2 ($6.34/SF) is the sale of a site at a signalized intersection in southeast Lewiston. This sale is superior in exposure and access, but this is offset by its substantial size inferiority. Thus, a similar value would be expected for the subject. Sale 6 ($6.75/SF) is included only as supplemental information, because of its age. This sale is situated at 5 th Street, between \"D\" Street and Main Street, kitty-corner from the subject site. After adjusting for market conditions, this sale is at the upper end of the range of comparables. This sale has frontage along three roadways and thus has superior exposure. Therefore, a lower rate is anticipated for the subject. Sale 3 ($5.89/SF) is a site located in the southwestern Lewiston, which was subsequently developed with an office building. This is a low indicator of value for the subject site. Sale 1 ($6.50/SF) is the sale of the subject site. The value of the site is predicated upon the value allocated to the usable land by the listing/selling agent that facilitated the sale of the subject in February 2005. Given the rates indicated by the sale comparables, the rate allocated to the subject's usable land from its recent sale, after adjusting for market conditions, is a good indicator for the subject. The following table summarizes the comparability of each site relative to the subject.

To do so, the appraiser first estimates the replacement cost new of the building and land improvements as of the date of the appraisal. Three sources have been relied upon for cost estimates: 1) the developer's cost budget, 2) the Marshall Valuation Service, a nationally recognized cost reporting authority, and 3) actual construction costs as available from other similar facilities recently developed in the market. COST OF IMPROVEMENTS NEW Developer's Cost Budget - The following table is a summary of the developer's cost budget. Since the costs were not current, it was necessary to make an upward adjustment to account for inflation. Therefore, cost multipliers from the Marshall Valuation Service were applied to the original costs. This resulted in a total cost of $4,524,507, or $93.40/SF, which is exclusive of land acquisition costs.

As shown, the subject building was analyzed as a mixture of average quality Class \"C\" Mixed Retail Center with Residential Units described on page 33 of Section 13 in the cost manual and average/good quality Class \"C/D\" Dormitory as described on page 14 of Section 11 in the cost manual. The cost calculation is further refined using multipliers for current and local costs. The base construction cost per square foot of the building area was estimated at $86.23. Additionally, lump-sum additions are necessary to account for site work/landscaping, appliances, and loan fees related to permanent financing. After these adjustments, the total hard and soft costs are estimated at $4,291,982, or $88.60/SF overall.

This cost comparable is Brewster Residence Hall, built in 2002 in Cheney, Washington, for students of Eastern Washington University. This property was built by the same developer as the subject, and is very similar is design. Brewster Residence Hall was built of wood-frame construction with a brick veneer. The four-story building has retail on the main level, in addition to administrative offices, a bike storage room, and a laundry facility. The building includes 2, 3, and 4 bedroom student-housing units in the upper levels. There is a common area kitchen on the 1st and 3rd floors. There are community lounges located on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The 4th floor has a skylight and a balcony, which overlooks the 3rd floor. Since the comparable was not current, it was necessary to make an upward adjustment to account for inflation. Therefore, cost multipliers from the Marshall Valuation Service were applied to the original costs.

CONSTRUCTION COST CORRELATION The developer's costs reflected a rate of $93.40/SF, or a total cost of $4,524,507. The Marshall Valuation Service shows a rate of $4,291,982, or $88.60/SF, which is lower than the developer's costs, but only slightly lower than the cost comparable at a rate of $4,301,593, or $90.47/SF. For newer construction like the subject, the developer's cost is commonly given greater emphasis. Also, the developer's costs are considered more reliable, as they are based on the specific construction characteristics of the subject.Therefore, replacement cost new has been estimated at a total of $4,481,070, or $92.50 per square foot. ENTREPRENEURIAL INCENTIVE Entrepreneurial profit is defined as \" A market-derived figure that represents the amount an entrepreneur receives for his or her contribution to a project and risk; the difference between the total cost of a property (cost of development) and its market value (property value after completion), which represents the entrepreneur's compensation for the risk and expertise associated with development.\"1 The Cost Approach is based on the principle of substitution, and assumes that no prudent buyer would pay more for a property than the cost to acquire a similar site and construct improvements of equivalent desirability and utility without any undue delay. As such, for a developer to choose construction as an equivalent option in comparison to acquisition of an existing property, it is necessary to add a figure for entrepreneurial profit. Although a particular development may or may not ultimately be profitable, it is still necessary to include this margin to reflect the anticipation of profit that a developer would require to undertake new construction, and to expend the time and effort to undertake the development. Sales of newly constructed properties had indicated entrepreneurial profit rates 8% to 18% of the properties construction cost new. The most recent comparable indicates a rate near the low side of the range, at 8%. This also coincides with recent interviews with local contractors and developers in their willingness to accept a lower profit margin in order to 1 The Appraisal Institute, The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 4th ed. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 96Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 74continue developing in a market with rising costs and stable rents. Considering the characteristics of the subject development, a profit margin of 15%, or $672,161 is considered an appropriate expected margin. DEPRECIATION Depreciation is the difference between the market value of an improvement and its replacement cost new. Depreciation in an improvement can result from three major causes operating individually or in combination. These causes are physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and external obsolescence. Physical deterioration includes such factors as the age of the improvements, general wear and tear, and deferred maintenance. This depreciation may be curable or incurable. As the subject was completed just over one year ago, the facility would not be expected to have any physical depreciation. Curable physical deterioration, or deferred maintenance, is a curable defect caused by deferred maintenance. As stated, the subject's newer condition would preclude it from any physical deterioration. Functional obsolescence is a reduction in value due to inadequacies or superadequacy in the subject's construction and includes such factors as the design and/or building characteristics not being well conceived or well utilized. Functional obsolescence can be curable or incurable. It is curable only when it is economically plausible to correct. The subject improvements appear to be adequately functional for their use as a mixed-use facility. External obsolescence is a loss in value due to influences outside the property that caused an adverse influence. This could occur through depressed market conditions, certain legislative actions, neighborhood transition, adverse adjacent property influences, and various other reasons. No adjustment is applied for external obsolescence. No forms of depreciation are deducted, thus the total depreciation deduction is $0, leading to an estimate for the depreciated value of the improvements totaling $5,153,231. COST APPROACH CONCLUSION This leads to a hypothetical stabilized value via the Cost Approach as follows: Construction Cost New (48,444 SF x $92.50/SF) $4,481,070 Entrepreneurial Profit @ 15% + $672,161 Total Development Cost New $5,153,231 Less Depreciation - $0 Depreciated Value of the Improvements $5,153,231 Plus Land Value + $92,000 Estimated Value $5,245,231 Rounded To: $ $5,250,000 ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 97Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 75SALES COMPARISON APPROACH OVERVIEW In the Sales Comparison Approach, market value is estimated by comparing properties similar to the subject that have recently been sold, are listed for sale, or are under contract.A major premise of this approach is that the market value of a property is directly related to the prices of comparable, competitive properties. It is also based on the principle of substitution, which holds that the value of the property tends to be set by the price that would be paid to acquire a substitute property of similar utility and desirability within a reasonable amount of time. The subject comprises two uses in the same facility, with 12,787 SF of retail space on the main floor and 26,805 SF of rentable area for student-oriented housing on the upper levels. The focus of our research was on sales, listings, and offers of other student-oriented/multi-family apartment complexes and retail centers in the Lewiston area.Notably, relatively few properties with these uses have sold in recent years, and it was necessary to consider other sales outside of the immediate area. The subject's living units will be analyzed first, followed by the retail space. Regarding the subject's living units, the primary physical units of comparison are the price per unit and the price per square foot. The living units have a larger than typical amount of space that is not included in the net rentable area due to the student-oriented design, which includes over 8,500 SF of space for interior corridors and stairs, study room, lobbies, storage rooms, and janitorial rooms. Therefore, the price per square foot comparison is not considered an appropriate technique for the subject, and as such, is not used.However, we did include a price per bedroom comparison. Additionally, a measure of comparison based on income, the Effective Gross Income Multiplier (EGIM), is used in this approach. The EGIM technique is appropriate within the Sales Comparison Approach because it is recognized that purchasers are most often concerned with the income-producing ability of the property. The effective gross income multiplier is derived by dividing the comparable's sales price by its effective gross income. The EGIM has the advantage of simplicity and ease of calculation. It is based on the premise that rents and sale prices move in the same direction, and essentially, in the same proportion as net incomes and sale prices. As mentioned, relatively few apartment sales have occurred in the Lewiston/Clarkston market, and of those sales that were found, none were considered appropriate for comparison to the subject. Therefore, it was necessary to broaden our search to include Eastern Washington and Western Idaho. However, among those sales that have occurred, few are similar in terms of quality, location, and investment size. We have adjusted for these differences in construction type/quality and age to provide a more reliable measure of comparison for the value of the subject. On the subsequent pages are details of the sale comparables, followed by an adjustment grid that summarizes the sales and shows the adjustments made for the superior and inferior characteristics of each property in comparison to the subject.

EGIMs tend to have an inverse relationship in comparison to expense ratios. The expense ratios for the comparables ranged from 33.5% to 48.2. The relationship between EGIM and expense ratio is arrayed in the following chart. Sale # Property EGIM Expense % 4 Russet Square Apartments 6.68 48.2% Subj. Clearwater Hall - 47.5% 1 Conrad Smith Apartments 7.72 45.1% 5 Clarke Terrace 7.49 42.9%2 Levick Apartments 7.60 39.9% 3 Taylor Apartments 7.88 33.5%Sale # Property EGIM Expense % 4 Russet Square Apartments 6.68 48.2% Subj.

The subject's expense ratio, as estimated, is 47.5%, which is at the upper end of the range of comparables. Considering the characteristics of the subject, an EGIM toward the lower end of the range is appropriate. An EGIM of 7.00 is concluded. The concluded EGIM is applied as follows: Concluded EGIM 7.00 Times Effective Gross Income x $463,613 Indicated Value $3,245,291 Rounded To $ $3,250,000 SALES COMPARISON APPROACH CONCLUSION - APARTMENT SALES The following summarizes the market value conclusions via each of the two techniques use: Technique Total Price Per Unit $2,720,000 Price Per Bedroom $4,450,000 Effective Gross Income Multiplier $3,250,000 As shown above, the three techniques used yielded a very dissimilar indication of values, ranging from $2,450,000 to $4,450,000. The price/unit and price/BR comparisons are hindered by the large amount of adjustment needed for comparison to the subject. For this reason, the EGIM technique is considered the most reliable in this instance. Giving primary emphasis to the EGIM technique, the estimated value via the Sales Comparison Approach is $ $3,500,000. The next step is to analyze the subject's retail space. On the subsequent pages are details of the sale comparables, followed by an adjustment grid that summarizes the sales and shows the adjustments made for the superior and inferior characteristics of each property in comparison to the subject.

ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 101Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 105ADJUSTMENTS TERMS OF TRANSACTION ADJUSTMENTS Financing - Each of the sales reflects a cash or cash equivalent transaction, and no adjustments for financing are necessary. Conditions of Sale - An adjustment for conditions of sale compensates for unusual buyer or seller motivations that influence sale price. For instance, when a seller gives the buyer an atypical rebate, discount, credit, or something of value to induce a conveyance, it is logical to deduct the worth of the giveback from the sale price. Residual sums represent the net or effective sale price. All of the comparable sales are arm's length transactions, and no adjustments are necessary. Immediate Expenditures - This adjustment is often applied to account for costs that were necessary to cure deferred maintenance or to make the facility usable as intended. Sale 4 was remodeled subsequent to its sale at a cost of $375,000. Therefore, this sale was adjusted upward by this amount. None of the other sales required an adjustment for immediate expenditures. Market Conditions - The best method of deriving a market conditions (time) adjustment comes from the sale/resale of the same property. It is noteworthy that over the past several years, overall capitalization rates have continued to fall as rental rates have continued to rise for newer properties, resulting in some appreciation in the retail market. Since typical lease escalations for retail space range from 2-3%/yr, we have applied a 2%/yr upward adjustment for changes in market conditions since the time of the sale. ADJUSTMENTS FOR PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES The preceding adjustments led to a figure that reflects the price that would be paid for each sale if it were a fee simple, arm's length, cash transaction occurring on the date of the appraisal. These prices will then be further adjusted for physical differences in comparison to the subject. In this case, the primary physical components of comparison are effective age, construction type/quality, and location. Other physical differences may also be applied as needed for specific issues. Effective Age - Although a total economic life of 45 years would imply a depreciation rate of 2.2%/yr, it must be recognized that properties tend to show less depreciation in the early part of their useful lives. For this reason, effective age adjustments are applied at a lower rate of 1.5%/yr . Other - An adjustment is applied for differences in construction type/quality, although an adjustment for this factor is based only on true differences in quality or finish because much of the physical differences between properties are already reflected in the effective age adjustment. Location is also adjusted for, while others items, as necessary, are simply considered in reconciling to a final value rate from within the range. DISCUSSION OF SALE COMPARABLES Sale 1 is the sale of University Pointe in May 2006 for $3,650,000. This two-story, 25,000 SF facility was built in 2003 and comprises retail on the ground floor and office space in the upper level. The building is of above-average quality, is elevatored, and is located on the periphery of the U of I Campus in Moscow, Idaho. After adjustments, this sale reflects ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 102Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 106a rate of $139.33/SF. This building is superior in size and is considered a low indicator for the subject. Sale 2 is the sale of the Stadium Way Retail Center in September 2004 for $4,550,000. This facility was completely renovated prior to the sale and included a freestanding Burger King on a pad site. Tenants include Starbucks, Little Caesar's, Sprint, Blockbuster, Supercuts and Barnes & Noble. After adjustments for market conditions, effective age, construction type, location and the included Burger King, this sale indicates a rate of $237.95/SF. This sale required the greatest amount of gross adjustments and is considered an outlier, relative to the other sale comparables. This is a high indicator of value for the subject. Sale 3 is the sale of the 21st Street Retail Center for $1,910,000 in July 2004. At the time of sale this 9,750 SF retail facility was newly built of good-quality steel-frame construction with four retail bays. Tenants included Starbucks, a Sprint Store, Check into Cash, and a Rent-A-Center. After adjustments, this sale reflects a value rate of $159.64/SF. This sale is slightly superior in size compared to the subject. Additionally, this building is occupied by national tenants. This sale is an indicator of the upper bracket of value for the subject. Sale 4 is the sale of the Deranleau Building in March 2004 for $825,000. The property comprised a retail building and warehouse. The warehouse and underlying land was allocated at $209,905, leaving $615,095 for the retail building and accompanying land. The retail building was completely gutted and remodeled after the sale at a cost of $375,000. This equates to a total adjusted price of $990,095 for the retail building. The 7,169 SF retail building was originally built in 1961, prior to its renovation in 2004, of masonry block construction. The building is currently leased to Diversified Specialty Institutes, which uses the building for blood transfusions. After adjustments, this sale indicates a rate of $155.73/SF. This building is superior in size, but this is offset by its inferior overall appeal, compared to the subject. A similar rate would be expected for the subject. Sale 5 is the listing of a newer retail center across from a Wal-Mart store in south Lewiston. The 12,178 SF retail facility is currently listed at $2,787,678 and comprises four retail bays that are fully occupied by Anytime Fitness, Unicel, Cash Advance, and Mattress Outlet. After adjustments, this listing indicates a rate of $160.42/SF. This is considered a slightly high indicator of value for the subject. PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT After adjustments for the differences described previously, the comparable sales reflected a range from $139.33/SF to $237.95/SF, with an average of $170.61/SF. When Sale 2 ($237.95/SF) is excluded, the range narrows to between $139.33/SF and $160.42/SF, with an average of $153.78/SF. Sale 1 ($139.33/SF) was the most recent, but due to its inferior size, is a low indicator for the subject. Sale 2 ($237.95/SF) is at the upper end of the range and is an outlier among the comparables. This is a high indicator for the subject. Sale 3 ($159.64/SF) is superior in size and is considered an indicator of the upper bracket of value for the subject. Sale 4 ($155.73/SF) is inferior in overall appeal compared to the subject, but is superior in size. A similar rate is expected for the subject. Sale 5 ($160.42/SF) is the listing of a newer retail facility at a major signalized intersection in south Lewiston. Due to the listing status of this comparable, a lower rate would be expected for the subject. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 103Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 107SALES COMPARISON APPROACH CONCLUSION - RETAIL SPACE Based on the preceding analysis, the data best supports a market value of $155/SF for the subject improvement. This is applied as follows: Indicated Value/SF $155.00 Times Building Area (SF) x 12,787 Indicated Value $1,981,985 Rounded To: $ $1,980,000 SALES COMPARISON APPROACH CONCLUSION The previously concluded values of the subject living units and retail space must be combined to arrive at a total value via the Sales Comparison Approach. This leads to a hypothetical stabilized value via the Sales Comparison Approach as follows: Indicated Value of Living Space $3,500,000 Plus Value of the Retail Space + $1,980,000 Total Indicated Value $ $5,480,000 ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 104Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 108INCOME APPROACH INCOME APPROACH OVERVIEW In the Income Approach, the expected rental income for a proposed property is estimated based on a comparison to rents achieved for similar properties in the market area.Deductions are made for vacancy and collection loss and expenses. The prospective net operating income is then estimated. For an existing property, the subject's operating history is analyzed and compared to other properties in the market. After estimating the stabilized NOI, an applicable capitalization method, and appropriate capitalization rates are developed and used in computations that lead to an indication of value. There are two methods of income capitalization: direct capitalization and yield capitalization, or discounted cash flow analysis. Both methods convert the future benefits property ownership into a present value. These methods convert income streams and resale value upon reversion into a capitalized, lump-sum value. In direct capitalization, the overall rate reflects a market-derived rate that includes both a return on and return of the investment in one blended rate, as applied to the stabilized income estimate for one year of operation. In yield capitalization, the cash flows over a typical investment holding period are discounted to their present value, including both cash flows from operation and the future resale of the property upon reversion. In this analysis, only the direct capitalization technique is employed. SUBJECT OPERATING INFORMATION INCOME/EXPENSE HISTORY We were provided with income/expense pro forma data and have included in the following table a reconstructed version for September 2007 to August 2008. While the income used in the pro forma is based on student housing, it should be noted that some of the expenses (real estate taxes and insurance) are likely inclusive of the subject's retail space. INCOME/EXPENSES PRO FORMA - Reconstructed Clearwater $185,951 As stated previously, the subject currently operates under a management agreement with Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC). A copy of this agreement is included in the addenda of this report. For the purposes of this analysis, the subject will be analyzed as though the ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 105Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 109management contract were not in effect. In the expense analysis portion of the Income Approach, the subject's operating income will be projected based upon an analysis of available operating data for other apartment buildings of similar use. SUBJECT LEASING ACTIVITY The subject's student housing has had an average occupancy rate of about 74% since it was completed in August 2006, with the exception of the summer term. The housing is reportedly mostly vacant during the summer months. The student housing is currently 74% occupied. The rental rates for the student housing are summarized in the following table. STUDENT HOUSING RENTAL RATES Clearwater Hall Dec-07 Living Units Type Avg Subtotal No. (BR/BA) 2 larger bdrms at $395/mo.STUDENT HOUSING RENTAL RATES Clearwater Hall Dec-07 Type Avg Subtotal No. (BR/BA) 2 larger bdrms at $395/mo. It should be noted that the $365/mo rental rate, shown in the above table, that LSCS remits to the developer is not the rate that LCSC collects from the student tenant. Lewis-Clark State College collects approximately $538/mo from the student tenant. The lower remittance rate reflects the unreimbursed costs that LCSC incurs for trash removal, cable, repair and maintenance, supplies, janitorial, and personnel. The subject's retail space is vacant. However, a lease agreement has been drawn up on about 7,047 SF of the subject's retail space that is located at the northeast corner of the building. The terms of this agreement are displayed in the table below. Tenant: Landlord: College Town Development Idaho Suite Size (SF): 7,047 SF Initial Term (Yrs): Town Suite Size (SF): 7,047 SF Initial Term (Yrs): Triple-NetClub Rain The owner reported that this lease will not be signed, as the rental rate is considered too low. The Town Square, across the street to the east of the subject, is a much older retail/office building that purportedly recently leased its 3,685 SF corner retail space for $12.00/SF/Yr. This building was built in 1892 and is inferior in condition, compared to the subject. Attempts to contact the owner of the Town Square to confirm the aforementioned lease were met with negative results. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 106Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 110Therefore, the entire 12,787 SF of the subject's ground-floor retail space is available for lease, and is currently being marketed at a rate of $12.00/SF/Yr, based on triple-net expense terms. The lease rates for the subject's retail space is summarized in the following table. RETAIL RENTAL RATES Clearwater Hall Dec-07 Bay Area (SF)Proposed Rent/SFSubtotal Rent/MoDeveloper's should be noted that while the retail space is divided into four bays, it would be possible to divide this space into more, or fewer bays, depending upon tenant demand. Additionally, the retail space is at a \"base shell\" state, as not all the space has been improved to a \"vanilla shell\" with walls ready to be painted, a concrete floor, a drop ceiling with lights, electrical outlets, HVAC, and restrooms. This will be taken into account when arriving at an \"as is\" value after the reconciliation. MARKET DATA The next step in the analysis is to determine the market rent levels for the subject via a comparison to comparable rental properties in the market. Additionally, due to the student-oriented design of the subject, other student-oriented housing developments were also considered. The subject's student housing will be analyzed first, followed by the subject's retail space.

This project was built at the same time as the subject and comprises 88 bedrooms in 22 units in one, three-story building. Like the subject, this facility includes furnished bedrooms, common laundry, storage, and air conditioning. However, the common area of each pod, or living unit, is not furnished. Twenty of the units comprise four-bedrooms and one bathroom, while the other two units include a three-bedroom unit and a five-bedroom unit.Additional amenities include disposals and open parking. Rental 2 is the Brewster Residence Hall, located in Cheney Washington. The complex was built in 2002 on the edge of the campus of Eastern Washington University. The four-story facility is privately owned, but is managed by Eastern Washington University. The building has a bookstore, coffee house, laundry facility, bike storage room, and administrative offices on the main level. The complex comprises 140 bedrooms that include two-, three-, and four-bedroom units. Each unit has a kitchen area with a refrigerator and sink, and a bathroom with a toilet and bathtub. There is an additional sink located just outside the bathroom. There are also two common area kitchens with a stove/oven, microwave, and sink. Each bedroom is furnished with a loft-able bed, chest of drawers, an armoire, and a desk and chair. Complex amenities include two lounge areas, an elevator, common laundry, and open parking. Rental 3 is the College Crest Apartments, located in Pullman, Washington. The complex comprises 54 three-bedroom units that can be leased on an individual bedroom basis. Each of the units has a separate outside entrance, in addition to a sink and a chest of drawers and a built-in desk. All these units are equipped with a sofa, chair, end tables, lamp, and a dining room table with four chairs. Additionally, the units include a living room, dishwasher, garbage disposer, and electric baseboard heat. Complex amenities include common laundry and open parking. Rental 4 is the Cougar Crest Apartments, located in Pullman, Washington. The complex comprises three- and four-bedroom units that groups of individuals typically get together and rent on an individual bedroom basis. The three-bedroom units have a den, which is utilized as a fourth bedroom in the four-bedroom units. Each bedroom has a sink and vanity, in addition to a phone jack and cable TV outlet. The units are equipped with dishwasher, garbage disposer, wall-mounted air conditioning, private deck/patio with storage closet, electric baseboard heat, and 2 baths. Complex amenities include common laundry, open parking, and a small exercise room. Rental 5 is the Breier Building Apartments, located in downtown Lewiston, two blocks east of the subject. This five-story building was constructed in 1925 with office space on the main level and 40 apartment units on the upper levels. The facility comprises one- and two-bedroom units, each equipped with garbage disposer and storage. Complex amenities include laundry and open parking. MARKET RENT CONCLUSIONS - STUDENT HOUSING The subject has 32 units that comprise 117 bedrooms, each furnished with a loft-able bed, an armoire, and a desk and chair. Each unit has a living room/kitchen area equipped with a refrigerator, kitchen sink, dining table with chairs, sofa, coffee table, and chair. The majority of the units have one bathroom with a shower and toilet that will have a sink located just outside the bathroom. Additionally, the facility has common laundry, a study room, and storage rooms. The subject is located in downtown Lewiston, with the Lewis-Clark State College campus located approximately seven blocks to the south. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 109Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 124The comparables reflect a range of $244/mo to $612/mo per bedroom, with an average of $435/mo. Comparables 1, 2, 3 and 4 lease on an individual bedroom basis and reflect an average of $474/BR/mo. Comparable 1 ($566/BR/mo) is College Place, which is located southwest of the subject, across the street from the LCSC campus. This 88-bedroom, student-oriented facility was recently completed at the same time as the subject, is managed by LCSC, and like the subject, is restricted to student tenants. This building is similar to the subject, but is closer to the college. However, the common area of each unit is not furnished. Considering the proximity of this comparable to the LCSC campus, this rate is a high indicator for the subject. Comparable 2 ($612/BR/mo) is located in Cheney, Washington, and is the very similar to the subject, since it is a student-oriented residence hall that's occupancy is restricted to Eastern Washington University (EWU) students. Like the subject, this facility has furnished bedrooms, common laundry, and storage area. However, the complex does have a lounge area, open parking, and two common area kitchens with a stove/oven, microwave, and sink. The building was constructed in 2002 on the edge of EWU's campus. Due to this comparables additional amenities, the rate indicated is high for the subject. Comparable 3 ($395/BR/mo) is located in Pullman, Washington, near the campus of Washington State University (WSU). This project was built in 1974 and is inferior to the subject in terms of age and quality. The bedrooms are equipped with a chest of drawers and a built-in desk. Additionally, all these units are equipped with a sofa, chair, end tables, lamp, and a dining room table with four chairs, much like the subject. However, this comparable also has dishwashers, garbage disposers, sinks in each bedroom, separate outside entrances to each of the units, and open parking. Considering this facility's age, quality, and amenities, this is an indicator of the upper lease rate that the subject could potentially achieve. Comparable 4 ($310/BR/mo to $350/BR/mo) is also located in Pullman, Washington, near the WSU campus. Groups of individuals typically get together and rent the units on an individual bedroom basis. This facility was built in the late 1990s and has an exercise room, private decks/patios, and a sink and vanity in each bedroom, unlike the subject.However, this is somewhat offset by its inferior age and lack of furnished bedrooms. This complex is an indicator of the lower bracket of lease rates that the subject could expect to achieve. Comparable 5 ($244/BR/mo to ($390/BR/mo) is an old building that is located about two blocks east of the subject. This comparable includes disposals and open parking, and is inferior in age and doesn't include furnished bedrooms. However, the one-bedroom units ($390/BR/mo) are not shared, and therefore are superior in this respect. Thus, the subject would be expected to fall within the upper range of rates reflected by this comparable. Considering the preceding discussion, a rate of $375/BR/mo is concluded for the subject's bedrooms. As additional supplemental market information, we have also included the rental rates of a few multi-family apartment complexes in the subject's market area as an added check on the subject's concluded lease rate. These comparables are summarized in the following table.

The subject's concluded rate of $375/BR/mo falls within this range and is very near the average rate. Comparable No. 2 is the newest of the comparables and reflects a rate that is less than the subject's rate. Considering the supplemental comparables, the subject's concluded rate of $375/BR/mo appears to be appropriate. As previously discussed, the subject's retail space will now be analyzed. It should be noted that the subject's retail space is not typical in comparison to its immediate area. The subject is located in Lewiston's central business district, which is mainly composed of older buildings that were built around 1900. Therefore, the majority of the buildings have dated storefront retail space that does not match the quality of the subject's retail space. The majority of the newer retail facilities in Lewiston are located along Thain Road in the southeast section of the city. Thus, the subject's lease rate would likely be at the upper end of the range of rates received for the dated retail space that is located in the subject's immediate area and below the newer retail space that is located in Lewiston's new retail corridor along Thain Road, which is continuing to develop. A grid summarizing the rental rates for properties that were considered most useful for comparison to the subject's retail space is displayed after the rent comparable details that follow.

ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 112Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 136DISCUSSION OF RENT COMPARABLES - RETAIL Rental 1 is a building occupied by H&R Block, about 0.75-miles east of the subject along Main Street. The 2,784 SF building was originally constructed as an optical store in 1996. The building is currently being leased at a rate of $5.50/SF/Yr (adjusted from modified gross to triple-net). The building has superior parking, but is inferior in age and condition compared to the subject. As a result, this is a low indicator for the subject's retail space. Rental 2 is a strip center with various storefront office/retail tenants. The 8,000 SF building is located one mile to the east of the subject. Most of the newer tenants in this building are leasing at a rate of about $8.83/SF/Yr (adjusted from modified gross to triple-net). This comparable has superior parking compared to the subject, but it is inferior in age, condition, exposure and overall appeal. Consequently, this is a low indicator for the subject. Rental 3 is the SL Start Building, located approximately two blocks northwest of the subject. This 11,058 SF building was originally constructed in 1897, but was extensively remodeled in 2004. SL Start occupies 3,453 SF of the two-story building, but reportedly only approximately 80%, or 2,762 SF is usable due to the ill-conceived design of the renovated space. This equates to an adjusted lease rate of $11.67/SF/Yr (adjusted for usable space and from modified gross expense terms to triple-net). This comparable has superior parking compared to the subject, since its lease includes about 10 off-street parking stalls. The condition is somewhat similar to the subject, however the design, exposure, and age are inferior. The rate indicated by this rental is an indicator of the lower rental bracket for the subject. Rental 4 is a newer strip retail building at the southwest corner of Thain Road and Stewart Avenue, a signalized intersection across the street from a Wal-Mart Store. This 13,178 SF retail center has four retail bays and is fully occupied. The bays range is size from 1,300 SF to 5,650 SF, with rental rates ranging from $13.63/SF/Yr to $22.00/SF/Yr, with an average of $16.94/SF/Yr. This facility is similar in age and condition to the subject, but has superior exposure. A lower rate would be expected for the subject than those indicated by this comparable. MARKET RENT CONCLUSIONS - RETAIL To better illustrate the comparison of the subject to each of the comparables, we have utilized a ranking analysis, displayed in the following chart. As shown, the subject lies between Rental 3 ($11.67/SF/Yr) and Rental 4 ($13.63/SF/Yr). No.Comparable RentalTypical Rent/SF/YrOverall Comparison Retail Center $13.63 $22.00 Superior -Subject $12.00 - 3 SL Start $11.67 Inferior 2 Strip Center $8.83 Inferior 1 H&R Block Building $5.96 Inferior This subject's current asking rate of $12.00/SF/Yr is well supported by the market comparables. Therefore, a lease rate of $12.00/SF/Yr is concluded for the subject's retail space. Conclusion of Gross Rental Income - As shown at the end of this section, the projected gross rental income for the subject, including student housing and retail income, is $679,944. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 113Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 137Laundry Income - The subject facility has a common laundry room on site with leased laundry machines from Hainsworth Company, a major leasing company for coin-operated laundry machines. We spoke with a representative from Hainsworth Company, who reported that student housing such as the subject typically generate 1.5 loads of laundry per student per week. Based on the subject's average occupancy rates and the laundry rates, this equates to an annual income of $6,264. Hainsworth's typical lease arrangement is for the property owner to retain \u00bd of the revenue earned by the machines. This would lead to a yearly income for laundry of $3,132. Therefore, the laundry income retained by the subject owners is estimated at $3,132/Yr, or $26.77/BR/Yr. Miscellaneous/Other Income: This category includes income retained from deposits, late fees, and other revenue. This item is projected at 3% of the living units rental revenue per year, or $15,795. All the discussed sources of income result in a Projected Gross Income of $698,871. VACANCY The rent comparables reflect an average vacancy of 6.4% for the student-oriented living units. There are no formal vacancy surveys that we are aware of for the Lewiston-Clarkston area. The subject is a newer facility that is well located in Lewiston's central business district about seven blocks north of the LCSC campus, comprises functional units, and has commensurate amenities with its targeted tenant pool. The subject's student housing has experienced an average occupancy rate of about 75% during the academic year, and approximately 8% during the summer term. This equates to a yearly vacancy rate of about 40%. As previously discussed, College Place, an 88-bedroom student- oriented facility located across the street from the LCSC campus that was completed at the same time as the subject, has also remained at about 75% occupied. However, as mentioned earlier, LCSC charges students approximately $538/Mo. Thus subject's vacancy rate would likely decline if its lease rates decreased to the concluded market rate of $375/Mo. Additionally, the summer vacancy rate would be expected to decrease substantially, since the subject's lease terms would allow 12-month leases that could be paid on a monthly basis. Currently, under the management agreement, the subject allows 12-month leases; however, the rent for the entire lease term must be paid up front, which severely discourages students from entering into a 12-month lease contract. Additionally, we have considered future demand for student housing at LCSC, which is summarized in the following table.

As shown in the previous table, total occupancy rate for student housing at LCSC is currently 84%. However, this is projected to increase to 95% by 2010, based on enrollment projections that were predicated on the enrollment history under the current LCSC administration (a common practice used in enrollment forecasting). Considering the lower market rates, improved contract terms, and increased occupancy projections, a stabilized vacancy rate of 15% is concluded for the subject student-oriented living units. This rate takes into account an increase in vacancy during the summer term. The subject's retail space currently has an unsigned lease for 7,047 SF. However, the subject owner reported that this lease will not be signed, as the rental rate is considered too low. Of the retail lease comparables surveyed, all were found to be fully occupied.However, due to the limited number of comparables, we have also consulted the Korpacz Real Estate Investor Survey , which showed that most institutional investors used a vacancy and credit loss assumption for the \"National Strip Shopping Center Market\" of between 1% and 10%.11 Considering the preceding discussion, a stabilized vacancy rate of 5% is concluded for the subject retail space. This results in a reduction of $89,486 annually, and leads to a total effective gross income estimate of $609,385/yr. OPERATING EXPENSES The operating expenses for the student-oriented living units will be analyzed first, followed by an analysis of the retail space expenses. Operating expenses for garden apartment complexes typically range from about $2.50/SF to $3.75/SF of leasable area in properties with full amenities, before an allowance for replacement reserves. Rents vary widely from property to property; therefore, analyzing expenses as a percentage of effective gross income does not provide a reliable indication.Reserves for the replacement of short-lived items are rarely allocated and less often funded by apartment owners, but must be considered in an appraisal analysis to reflect the periodic replacement of these items on a stabilized basis. The only expense information provided for the subject facility was a pro forma, which was displayed near the beginning of the Income Approach. Therefore, we have considered the experience of two comparable apartment properties and the developer's expense pro 11 PricewaterhouseCoopers, Korpacz Real Estate Investor Survey, 3rdQtr. 2007, p. 45. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 115Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 139forma. After analyzing this data, operating expenses payable by the owner were estimated for a stabilized year by category. This information is summarized on the following pages.

Electric bb heat, washer/dryer in unit, and open parking (some covered). Real Estate Taxes - The subject is currently assessed at $4,253,499, which results in a total tax bill of $78,971. However, as the retail tenants will be responsible for their pro rate share of the real estate taxes, their share must be deducted from the total taxes in order to arrive at the subject's student housing share of the taxes. Since the student housing accounts for 74% of the total property, their share of the real estate tax is calculated at $58,439, or $0.11/SF. Based on this information the subject's taxes are applied at a tax amount of $58,400/yr, or $2.18/SF. Personal Property Taxes - Since the subject's units are furnished, a cost for personal property tax is incurred. The subject's pro forma indicates a personal property tax of $4,500/yr. As such, this amount has been applied to the subject. Insurance rates vary widely from property to property, depending on quality, amenities, existence of sprinklers, and other market factors. The expense comparables reflect insurance rates ranging from $0.18/SF to $0.19/SF. The developer's pro forma reflects an expense rate of $0.63/SF for this item, which is much higher than the comparables. However, additional insurance coverage, due to the characteristics of the subject's tenants, is likely. Therefore, a rate of $0.63/SF, or $17,020/yr has been projected for the subject. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 116Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 140Energy (Gas & Electricity) - The two expense comparables indicated an expense of $0.07/SF and $0.11/SF for this item. However, these expenses reflect costs incurred for their common area only. The subject provides gas and electricity for the tenants, and therefore a higher rate is anticipated. The subject's pro forma shows a rate of $1.03/SF for this expense. A representative for the owner stated that gas and electricity generally average between $2,000 and $2,200 per month. This equates to a range of $24,000 to $26,400 per year, or $0.90/SF to $0.98/SF. Considering this information, a rate of $1.00/SF is estimated for the subject. Utilities (Water & Sewer) - The comparables displayed a total expense for these items at $0.25/SF and $0.30/SF. The owner's pro forma reflected a rate of $0.51/SF for this item. Considering the characteristics of the subject and its tenants, a combined rate of $0.50/SF is projected. Trash Removal - Only one of the comparables reported this expense as a separate line item, which was $0.24/SF. The developer's pro forma did not show a separate line item for this expense. According to Lewis-Clark State College, which currently pays for this expense item, incur a monthly cost of $600 for trash removal. This equates to a rate of $7,200/yr, or $0.27/SF. A rate of $0.27/SF/yr is estimated for the subject. Maintenance and Repairs can vary widely from year to year. The comparables reported expenses ranging from $0.26/SF to $0.54/SF. The subject's pro forma shows a rate of $0.05/SF. However, this is under the current management contract, in which Lewis-Clark State College pays for routine maintenance. As this analysis will arrive at a value as though this contract were not in place, a rate will need to be estimated for this expense item. The subject has furnished units, and thus a rate at the upper end of the comparables is indicated. Therefore, this expense item is projected at $0.55/SF. Elevator - None of the comparables were helpful in estimating this expense, as they are not elevatored complexes. A representative for the owner reported they have a maintenance contract for the elevator at a cost of approximately $1,900/yr. Based on this information, a rate of $1,900/yr, or $0.07/SF is applied to the subject. Redecorating and Cleaning Expenses typically range from a combined total of $0.08/SF to $0.18/SF. Only one of the comparables reported this expense as a separate line item, which was $0.09/SF. Considering the tenant makeup, a rate of $0.15/SF is estimated for the subject. Landscaping and Grounds Expenses can vary according to the size and extent of on-site landscaping. Among the comparables, these combined charges ranged from $0.02/SF to $0.31/SF. The developer's pro forma did not show a separate line item for this expense. Considering the subject's small site size and very minimal landscaping needs, $0.05/SF is concluded for the subject. Professional ManagementExpenses typically range from 5.0% to 12.0% of effective gross income, depending on the number of units, the income level generated by the complex, and the difficulty of management. Larger, easily managed properties are obtaining management fees of 4.0% to 5.0% for professional management only. The expense comparables indicated rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.7% of EGI, while a survey from the Urban Land Institute on multifamily housing indicates a rate of 5.0% for elevatored apartment complexes in the Northwest. Given the size of the subject and the characteristics of the potential tenants, a professional management expense of 6.0% of Effective Gross Income is applied to the subject. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 117Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 141Marketing Expenses vary widely with occupancy levels and overall market conditions. Only one of the comparables reported this expense as a separate line item, which was $0.01/SF. The pool of potential tenants for the subject is limited, due to the specific tenant base that it accommodates. Considering the subject's location, its special purpose design for student housing and the involvement of LCSC, a minimal rate of $0.02/SF is applied to the subject. Office and Administrative Expenses can vary widely, depending on what items are included in this category. None of the comparables reported an expense for this item. The owner's expense pro forma did not show a separate line item for this expense. Given the characteristics of the subject, a minimal charge of $0.05/SF annually is estimated the subject. Legal, Audit, and Professional Service Expenses can also vary widely, and are often sporadic. Legal fees tend to be higher during times of high vacancy and the resulting credit loss. Assuming careful screening and operation of the subject, a charge of $0.05/SF is applied to the subject. Telephone/Internet Expenses - As these expense items are included in the student leases, it is necessary to account for their costs. The owner's pro forma indicates a charge of $10,580/yr, or $0.39/SF for this item. As such, this expense is projected at $10,580/yr. Miscellaneous Expenses often vary, depending on what items are included in this category. Other complexes typically indicate a range of $0.03/SF to $0.08/SF, though property managers are inconsistent in what charges are recorded under this \"catch all\" category. A rate of $0.03/SF is applied to the subject. Reservesare not often allocated by apartment owners, but must be included to reflect an annualized estimate of the ongoing cost for the replacement of short-lived items. In this analysis, we have estimated the current replacement cost and life of the short-lived components listed below. Because the sinking fund factor is calculated at an estimated \"real\" rate of return (taking inflation into account), it is not necessary to trend this cost upward. The following grid summarizes the reserves that are projected for the subject facility.

This rate is higher than the typical apartment complex operating expenses. However, given that the subject rents will include all utilities, and that the subject will furnish the bedrooms, units, and lobby areas, this rate is appropriate. This leads to a net operating income estimate of $243,187/yr for the subject's living units. The next step is to analyze the subject's retail space expenses. The subject's retail space will be leased on a triple-net expense basis, meaning that tenants are responsible for the payment of all operating expenses either directly, or in the form of a reimbursement to the owners. Despite this expense situation, most investors will still anticipate some costs associated with ownership/asset management, and the likelihood of some capital improvement costs, particularly upon turnover ore renewal. Asset Management Fee: This is a \"catch all\" category that accounts for those items that cannot realistically be charged back to the tenants as a reimbursement. It includes most in-house costs associated with the operation of the project. According to the Korpacz Real Estate Investor Survey, most investors include an asset management fee ranging from 2.5% to 5.0% for shopping centers as an \"above the line\" charge.12 This expense is estimated at 3% of EGI, or $4,373. Replacement Reserves: This category is used to account for the replacement of short-lived items and capital improvements for which tenants are not likely to be charged. This can include structural damage, roof replacement, HVAC repairs/replacement, etc. The Korpacz survey referenced above also shows that investors will typically apply a deduction for replacement reserves ranging from $0.10/SF to $0.30/SF. Considering the condition of the subject, a rate of $0.15/SF is applied. This equates to $1,918/yr. This leads to a net operating income estimate of $139,481/yr for the subject's retail space. DIRECT CAPITALIZATION RATE The subject's capitalization rate for its student-oriented living units will be analyzed first, followed by an analysis of the subject's retail space capitalization rate. The best source for deriving direct capitalization rates is typically by comparison to market sales, with consideration given to such factors as tenant quality, date of transaction, quality, and location. Overall rates can be extracted from the five apartment sales used in the Sales Comparison Approach. As shown on the following chart, the overall rates reflect a range from 7.12% to 8.43%, with an average of 7.76%.

ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 119Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 143design, that it may be attractive to a more limited pool of investors. According to the Korpacz Real Estate Investor Survey , the \"National Apartment Market\" experienced an average overall rate of 5.76%, with a range of 3.50% to 8.00%, for the third quarter of 2007.13 This was a reduction from the previous quarter and a year ago, which were 6.28% and 7.01%, respectively. Overall rates in Lewiston generally tend to lie above the rates indicated for larger metropolitan markets, which constitute the bulk of the survey. Given the preceding information and the subject's newer construction, investment size, amenity level, and design, a rate of 7.75% is concluded for the subject's living units. The overall rates for the subject's retail space can be extracted from four of the five retail sales used in the Sales Comparison Approach. As shown on the following chart, the overall rates reflect a range from 6.71% to 7.82%, with an average of 7.31%.

However, this is a listing, and therefore is considered slightly low for the subject. Sale 1 (6.71%) is the most recent sale among the comparables, and is located on the fringe of the U of I campus in Moscow. This is an indicator of the lower range that the subject could be expected to achieve. Sale 3 (7.82%) is located in Lewiston, but is somewhat dated, and thus doesn't reflect the general downward trend in capitalization rates over the past few years. As a result, a lower rate would be expected for the subject. According to the Korpacz Real Estate Investor Survey , the \"National Strip Shopping Center Market\" experienced an average overall rate of 7.20%, with a range of 5.70% to 9.00%, for the fourth quarter of 2007.14 As previously mentioned, overall rates in Lewiston generally tend to lie above the rates indicated for larger metropolitan markets, which constitute the bulk of the survey. Given the preceding information and the subject's newer construction and investment size, a rate of 7.25% is concluded for the subject's retail space. INCOME APPROACH CONCLUSION Applying the concluded overall rate of 7.75% for the subject's living units to its corresponding projected net operating income of $243,187/yr, results in an indicated value of $3,137,897. Additionally, applying the concluded overall rate of 7.25% for the subject's retail space to its corresponding projected net operating income of $139,481/yr, leads to an indicated value of $1,923,876. These values combine for a total indicated hypothetical stabilized value via the Income Approach of $ $5,060,000(rd).

Factors considered in the analysis include the type of property being appraised, the appropriateness and reliability of each approach, and the quality, quantity and appropriateness of the available data. The results of the three approaches are as follows: Cost Approach $5,250,000 Sales Comparison Approach $5,480,000 Income Approach $5,060,000 The Cost Approach is most often used to test the feasibility of a proposed project, rather than to estimate market value. It is also less useful for evaluating leased fee, versus fee simple, interest in a property. The reliability of this approach is also largely dependent upon the ability to accurately estimate depreciation. For new or proposed properties with no depreciation, this is not a problem. For older properties, however, depreciation can be a major percentage of value and is difficult to estimate reliably. In the subject's case, it represents newer construction, and costs were consistent among the cost comparables. However, as previously stated, the Cost Approach is more useful as a check on the feasibility of a project, as opposed to an estimate of market value. Therefore, the Cost Approach is given little weight in this final analysis. The Sales Comparison Approach is most valuable for homogeneous properties that sell frequently. Although the market for retail and apartment facilities is fairly active, and a number of sales were analyzed, there is very little homogeneity with respect to investment size, quality, tenant profile, or location among the sales. As a result, it was necessary to apply substantial subjective adjustments to account for these differences, which led to a fairly broad range of value/SF indications. Given the quality and quantity of the data available for analysis, in addition to the substantial adjustments, this approach is given only secondary emphasis in the final analysis. The Income Approach is given significant consideration in the final value conclusion. Typical buyers of commercial real estate are primarily concerned with the income- generating potential of a property, and thus make purchase decisions based largely on the income a property is currently or will possibly produce. In this case, although minimal operating history was available for the subject, rents and expenses were generally well supported by other properties in the market area. Based on the good quality and quantity of the data, and the importance placed on this approach by investors, this approach is considered the most reliable, and is given primary emphasis. Overall, most reliance has been placed on the results of the Income Approach, with secondary consideration to the Sales Comparison Approach. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 122Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 146Based on the preceding analysis and subject to the assumptions and limiting conditions contained within this report, we are of the opinion that the hypothetical stabilized market value of the leased fee interest in the subject property without the management agreement in effect, as of October 6, 2009, the date of stabilization, will be: FIVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,200,000) ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 123Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 147VALUE AS IS Two discounts are necessary to arrive at a value upon completion but prior to stabilization: 1) Vanilla shell discount for retail space and 2) absorption discount for retail space. BASE SHELL DISCOUNT The preceding analysis led to a hypothetical valuation of the subject upon stabilization, as though the retail space were finished with a \"Vanilla Shell\" (finished walls, ceilings, and bathrooms). The subject's retail space is currently finished to a \"Base Shell\" state with bare studs, open ceiling, concrete/dirt floors, and no plumbing. Therefore, a discount is required in order to account for the difference in value between the \"Base Shell\" and the \"Vanilla Shell.\" This is accomplished by applying a build-out cost to the retail portion of the subject. The Marshall Valuation Service (MVS) indicates a cost of $35.05/SF to build-out shopping center interior retail space with drywall, tile ceilings, vinyl composition/carpet floor cover, adequate lighting and outlets, small restrooms, and package A/C. Whereas another source suggests a cost of $10/SF for walls ready to be painted, a concrete floor, a drop ceiling with lights, electrical outlets, HVAC, and restrooms. In addition, the subject owner suggested a cost of $15/SF. Considering the amount of build-out needed for the subject, a rate of $15/SF is applied to the retail space. This equates to a rounded discount of $190,000 ($10/SF X 12,787 SF = $191,805). ABSORPTION DISCOUNT The subject's retail space has been vacant since it was completed in August 2006. The owner sites two reasons for this lack of leasing activity. 1) The leasing agents that are currently marketing the subject property's retail space are based in Spokane, Washington, and therefore are not local. After discussions with other business owners in the immediate vicinity of the subject, the owner reported that local representation is important. 2) The owner also reported that representatives from Lewis-Clark State College had unknowingly misstated the lease rate when queried by purportedly potential tenants. The college had apparently indicated that the asking rate for the retail space was $12/SF/Mo, rather than $12/SF/Yr. To measure the difference between the values \"upon stabilization\" and \"as is,\" the rent loss and additional expenses can be estimated and discounted into a present value. This discount is then subtracted from the stabilized value to arrive at the as is value. The first step in this analysis is to estimate the projected time it will take to bring the property to stabilization. The best measure of absorption is by a comparison to the absorption periods of other, similar projects in the market area. We are only aware of two recently developed retail projects in the Lewiston area that are similar in size to the subject. 1) A 13,178 SF strip retail center was completed in July 2005 at a major signalized intersection across the street from a Wal-Mart store in southeast Lewiston. This retail center was only recently fully absorbed in November 2007. Thus the strip center took approximately 28 months to absorb, which equates to an absorption rate of approximately 470 SF/Mo. The developer of this project, Marshall Clark stated that retail takes longer to absorb in Lewiston, compared to other market areas, and suggested that other developments in Lewiston have also taken longer than normal to absorb. ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 124Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 1482) The 21st Street Retail Center, a 9,750 SF strip retail facility located along 21st Street in southeast Lewiston was completed in 2004. This retail center reportedly took two years to absorb, which equates to an absorption rate of 406 SF/Mo. Assuming a 95% stabilized occupancy, there will be approximately 12,148 SF of retail space that will need to be occupied before stabilization is reached. It is estimated that the subject will lease space at approximately 400 SF/Mo. Using this absorption rate, it will take approximately thirty-one months to absorb the subject's retail space. Given that the subject was completed in August 2006, theoretically, about fifteen months has already been accrued. However, due to the reportedly poor marketing of the facility, only nine months is considered to have accrued to the subject's absorption period. Therefore, it will take an additional twenty-two months to lease the subject's retail space. Additionally, some marketing and leasing commissions will be incurred prior to reaching stabilization.

Deducting the base shell discount of $190,000 and the absorption discount of $100,000 from the stabilized value conclusion of $5,200,000, the hypothetical \"as is\" market value of the leased fee interest in the subject property, as of December 6, 2007, is: FOUR MILLION NINE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($4,910,000) ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 125Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 149ANALYSIS WITH MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT The previous analysis led to a hypothetical market value of the leased fee interest in the subject as though the current management contract with Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC) were not in effect. Key excerpts of this management contract are included in the addenda of this report. As the subject is a student-oriented housing facility, it would still rely on student demand from LCSC even if the management agreement were not in place. However, the management agreement does defray some of the operating expenses incurred by the subject. Therefore, the Income Approach will be readdressed to make the appropriate adjustments to the expenses that are affected by the management agreement. Since the Cost and Sales Comparison Approaches are not affected by the management agreement, these approaches have not been revisited. INCOME APPROACH Under the management agreement, the management is responsible for janitorial, trash removal, maintenance of landscaping. Therefore, the following expense items that were included in the previous analysis, will be excluded: 1) Trash Removal, 2) Redecorating/Cleaning, and3) Landscaping/Grounds. Additionally, under the management agreement, the owner is responsible for all structural and mechanical elements of the facility. Therefore, general maintenance costs will be absorbed by the management. In the prior analysis, this expense item was estimated at $0.55/SF. Since structural and mechanical costs are not separately broken out in the Urban Land Institute's survey of multifamily housing (a national survey commonly referenced as source material for operating costs of apartments), we have relied on BOMA International's Experience Exchange Report for income and expense data, a nationally recognized income and expense data source for commercial real estate. According to the BOMA report, HVAC, electrical, structural, plumbing, and general exterior maintenance are estimated at $0.23/SF. Therefore, the subject's maintenance and repairs is estimated at $0.23/SF. Additionally, taking into account the subject's average occupancy rate near 60% (inclusive of the summer occupancy rate), while considering the increasing student housing occupancy rates projected in the Income Approach section of this report, a vacancy rate of 25% is used in this analysis. Since the management agreement doesn't allow for a management fee, unless occupancy rates equal or exceed 85%, it is unlikely that a management fee will be charged. As a result, an expense for management is excluded in this analysis. After the preceding changes have been applied to the subject's expenses, the resulting net operating income (NOI) is $226,753/yr. Applying the previously concluded overall rate of 7.75% for the subject's living units to the net operating income of $226,753/yr, an indicated value of $2,925,845 results. When this value is added to the previously concluded value of $1,923,876 for the subject's retail space, as concluded in the prior ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 13 Page 126Clearwater Hall As of December 6, 2007 PAGE #07.197 150Income Approach, this leads to an indicated value of $ $4,850,000(rd).

S. Dept. of Education describing the progress made toward the project's overall objectives. This requires consistent collection, analysis, and reporting on t he participation and outcome data that enables the U.S. Dept. of Education to verify that GEAR UP Idaho is accomplishing its proposed objectives. Continued funding throughout the grant cycle is dependent upon making progress and m eeting the program objectives. Currently, the required annual reports have been developed and submitted through a process requiring manual collecti on and compilation of data. General data categories include individual student demographic and academic performance data, information on types of services and programs provided, student participation in the services and programs, teacher professional development activities and participat ion, parent services, programs and participation, and student and parent surveys. The State Department of Education init ially engaged a contractor to provide evaluation services for GEAR UP. T he proposed costs were $430,000 per year and significantly curtailed t he availability of funding for services to students in the GEAR UP schools. The contractor was re leased prior to the start of services. The GEAR UP grant currently has $173,300 of federal f unding set aside per year for the purposes of a contra ct for evaluation services. IMPACT On a national level, the evaluation of GEAR UP program s has led to an expansion in the number of web-based data collection and evaluation providers. Costs range from $75,000 to over $250,000 per year. Total contract costs for GEAR UP Idaho for the rema inder of the grant cycle (4 years) may reach $1,000,000. STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Currently data is housed in each of t he 38 schools with a GEAR UP Idaho cohort. Manual data retrieval and paper reporting present signific ant expenditure of staff time in basic data collecti on, quality review, analysis, and reporting. As the final cohort begins classes this fall, this work load will increase, at a minimum, by one third. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES OCTOBER 9-10, 2008 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 14 Page 2 Moving to an electronic data collecti on, analysis, and reporting system will provide significant savings in staff time at the schools and the Board office.

The two residency programs are increasin gly placing a new focus on advanced obstetric and newborn care training for family medicine residents because the residents are finding that t hey are the major obstetric and newborn clinicians in their chosen communities. A major com ponent of that training is on the prevention of diseases caus ed by smoking and substance abuse - diseases that are disasters both to the pregnant wo man and to the developing fetus and newborn. Just as the Millennium Committee jump-started the rural training tracks in FY 2008 and the prevention of s ubstance abuse in rural populations in general, this new \"Clean Start\" project for FY 2010 would jump-start the focus at both residencies on advanced matern ity care and perinatal training. Grant applications are due to the Joint Millennium Fund Committee by close of business day Friday, October 10, 2008. The Committee will ho ld a meeting in Boise on October 30, 2008. Funding de cisions by the Committee will be made by April 2009. IMPACT According to the Millennium Fund app lication guidelines, t he Committee will only consider applications directly rela ted to one or more of the following: 1. tobacco cessation or prevention 2. substance abuse cessation or prevention 3. tobacco or substance abus e related disease treatment The Clean Start project is targeted to trai ning on the prevention of diseases caused by smoking and substance abuse - diseases that are disasters both to pregnant women, to developing fetuses and newborns. The Clean Start project also has a training component specifically aimed at teaching resi dents how to recognize and treat the obstetrical and newborn dise ases caused by smoking and substance abuse.

Many pregnancies are impacted by smoking, drug use and abuse, poverty, unhealthy diets, pre-existing chronic diseases, and poor lifestyle choice s that adversely affect maternal and neonatal outcomes. These problems are compounded by poor access to physicians trained in the care of high-risk pregnancies. Treating undesirable outcomes such as developmental delay and pre- maturity after the fact is less successful, and more expensive, than implementing prevention strategies. This proposal is designed to pilot strategies for im proving outcomes in this patient population at Idaho's two family medicine programs. Because the progra ms are unique this paper presents both proposals below. The shared overarching goals of this request are as follows: Goal 1: To pilot at the two Idaho family medicine residen cy's new approaches to improving outcomes of high-risk pregnancies by developing clean- start interventions at both programs. Goal 2: To encourage residents to incorporate clean-start approaches into their practices upon graduation by incorporating successful strategi es into the ongoing curriculum of both programs. Goal 3: To provide information to the Governor, Legisl ature, and State Board of Education on the most effective approaches which should be incorporated into basic graduate medical educational programs for successful perinatal health outcomes. The two requests included in this prop osal are outlined in more detail below. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 15 Page 4 SECTION 2: Family Medicine Residency of Idaho (FMRI) Request: GOALS The goals of this project from FMRI will be the following: 1. To produce healthy outcomes in high risk obst etrical patients and their newborn babies in the following areas: a. OB patients that screen positive for the following: i. Elicit drug and substance abuse. ii. Tobacco use and abuse. iii. Alcohol use and abuse. b. OB patients that are on therapeutic me dications for mental illness, diabetes, and hypertension amongst others for their potential for causing birth defects. c. OB patients with unhealthy lifestyles that need education and coaching in the areas of: i. Diet. ii. Nutrition. iii. Exercise. 2. Outstanding family medicine education in the ar eas of screening, recognition, intervention, and the management of the following: a. Elicit drug and substance abuse. b. Therapeutic drug use that may cause birth defects. c. Healthy lifestyle that will maximize healthy mothers and babies. METHODS FMRI will achieve the above goals by providing oversight to patient ca re and resident education using the following: 1. FMRI obstetrical faculty includes doct ors Marietta Thompson and Cyndi Hayes. 2. FMRI family medicine faculty, to include doctors Elizabeth Rulon and Jennifer Petrie. 3. FMRI certified nurse midwife - Sarah Cox. 4. FMRI pediatric faculty, to includ e doctors Perry Brown and Susan Kim. 5. FMRI faculty pharmacologi st - Dr. Roger Hefflinger. 6. FMRI faculty behavioral health doctors Alex Reed and Jeralyn Jones. 7. Perinatologists - Doctors Clarence Blea, Stacy Seyb, Richard Lee, and Mike Kasulka. In addition to this grant, FMRI will develop an Obstetrical Fellowship which will be a permanent program of one year in training that will provide advanced obst etrical training to Family Medicine Residency of Idaho residents after the residency program for a one year period of time. FMRI will also obtain a nutritionist to help with many of the items mentioned above as well as a case manager, which will either be a certified nurse midwife or a registered nurse t hat will provide active management of this patient population in conjunction with the physicians mentioned. FMRI is successfully utilizing a group visit model, w here groups of eight to ten obstetrical patients go through their pregnancy together under the supervisi on of our residency teams that maximize healthy maternal and fetal outcomes. It is envisioned that we will utilize similar group model formats for these high risk patients in which care in all the above areas will be rendered, with the po wer of patients teaching patients and reinforcing positive, health behavio rs and healthy choices will be emphasized. All of these items will be integrat ed and coordinated through our health information technology of our Centricity Electronic Medical Record to provide sc reening tools, prevention templates, and intervention and management tools at the point of service with this patient population. We will also utilize the therapeutic lifestyle template that ISU's family medicine program uses. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 15 Page 5 OUTCOMES - The major outcomes of this Clean Start Millennium Grant for FMRI will be the following: 1. All obstetrical patients will be screened and all hi gh risk obstetrical patients with elicit drug and substance abuse (tobacco abuse, alcohol abuse, and therapeutic medicine use) that could be teratogenic to their newborn babies will be identified. 2. These patients will be managed to provide maximized health outcome to the mothers and their newborn children. 3. Outstanding ongoing, permanent education will be conducted to all 33 of the Family Medicine Residency of Idaho family physician residents to imprint this style of care for their future practices. 4. A permanent obstetrical fellowship program w ill be initiated that will be a permanent, ongoing program from this project. Estimated Budget: $500,000 (detail being developed) SECTION 3: Idaho State University Family Medicine Residency (ISU FMR) Request: Goal 1: Enhancement of High risk Obstetrical training to Family Medicine residents. Both of Idaho's Family Medicine Residencies provide exemplary obstet rical training to their resident physicians. Both Residencies care for a vulnerable and at-risk patient population. The ISU Family Medicine Residency (ISU FMR) cares for a large number of Native Americans, Hispanics and rural poor. Each resident delivers about 180 patients over three years and the residency cares for about 1,000 deliveries per year. Training family physicians to provide high-risk matern ity care requires a unique level of supervision. A curriculum will be taught on the recognition of and in terventions for the growth retarded fetus of the smoking mother, the abrupted placenta of the co caine addict and the hypertensive crisis of the amphetamine addict. Resident training in high risk obstetrical management will be maximized by increased access to the Residency's obstetrical coor dinator, Donald Dyer, MD. Perinatology consultation and training will be provided by the perinatologist from the University of Utah, Michael Varner, MD. An obstetrically active family physician will be hired part time to role model exemplary care, consultative interactions and preventive management. The case m anager described above will identify the high risk patients.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Section 33-1003 (2)(b), Idaho Code BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION At the October 1999 meeting, the State Board of Educat ion approved the request by Cassia County School District #151 for Albion Elementary School to be designated as a hardship elementary school for one year, and required an annual report. However, the 2000 Legislature amended 33-1003 (2)(b) by adding, \"An elementary school operating as a previously approved hardship elementary school shall continue to be c onsidered as a separ ate attendance unit, unless the hardship status of the elementary school is rescinded by the state board of education.\" Therefore, no action is required unless the State Board of Education chooses to re scind the hardship status. Conditions supporting the October 1999 decision approve the Albion Elementary School as a Hardship Elementary School have not changed. IMPACT Cassia County School District #151 would have received $8 0,936.72 less in FY 2008 if Albion Elementary School was not considered a separate school.
