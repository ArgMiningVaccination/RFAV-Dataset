Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new .\"YOGI BHAJAN -The Last Breath This last breath is also a last chance. As you die, you assess your actions and their karmas. According to the frequency of your last breath and your last thought, you can project beyond the reactions to your karmas. So in the act of dying, the projected frequency of your last breath establishes your relationship with the Infinite. \"Why are you afraid of death? Because you do not understand death. What is death? Death is that constant calm .\" Meditation for Conquering Death Meditation for Crossing the Hour of DeathThe Importance of Death to Soul's Spiritual Evolution \"Of all footprints, that of the elephant is supreme. Similarly, of all mindfulness meditations, that on death is supreme.\"-The Buddha \"When it comes time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so when their time comes, they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.

The use of meditation increased more than threefold from 4.1% in 2012 to 14.2% in 2017. In 2012, chiropractic care was as popular as yoga, followed by meditation; however, the popularity of meditation surpassed that of chiropractic care to become the second most used approach among those surveyed in 2017. The use of chiropractors increased from 9.1% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2017. In 2017, women were more than twice as likely to use yoga compared with men (19.8% versus 8.6%). Women were also more likely than men to use meditation (16.3% versus 11.8%) and see a chiropractor (11.1% versus 9.4%). Non -Hispanic white adults were more likely to use yoga, meditation, and chiropractors compared with Hispanic and non- Hispanic black adults. The use of yoga was highest among adults aged 18 to 44 compared to older adults, while the use of meditation and chiropractic care was higher among adults aged 45 to 64 years compared with younger and older agegroups.Tai Chi and Qi Gong In 2002, over 2.5 million Tai Chi users and 500,000 Qi Gong users in the United States low-impact , traditional Chinese exercises with a low risk of side -effects and a lack of drug interactions. improve health- related quality -of-life in physical and mental health conditions. may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, and mood evidence is promising but limited for Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, sleep disturbance, substance abuse, and impaired cognitive functioning.

Altern Complement Med 2012 .A systematic review with both narrative synthesis and meta -analysis. Original studies from 1950 to November 2010 were sought, evaluating the effects of yoga on older adults. The search was restricted to randomized controlled trials of yoga in subjects age 60, and published in English. The search yielded 18 eligible studies (N=649). The studies reported on older adults across a range of settings, intervention intensity, and outcome measures. The majority of the studies had<35 participants (range 9 -77). The benefits of yoga may exceed those of conventional exercise interventions for self-rated health status, aerobic fitness, and strength. However , the effect sizes were modest, and the evidence was mixed for yoga's effect on depression, sleep, and bone -mineral density. Studies did not find an effect on cognition.Meditation (MBSR) Programs for Psychological Stress and Well -being A Systematic Review and Meta -analysis Goyal, et al 2014 Meta -analyses- after 18 753 citations, included 47 trials with 3515 participants. Mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence of improved anxiety (effect size, 0.38 [95%CI, 0.12-0.64] at 8 weeks and 0.22 [0.02- 0.43] at 3-6 months), depression (0.30 [0.00-0.59] at 8 weeks and 0.23 -0.42] at 3-6 months), and pain (0.33 [0.03- 0.62]) Low evidence of improved stress/distress and mental health- related quality of life,positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight .

This meditation involves repetitive finger movements, or mudras, plus verbal chanting and silent chanting of the mantra \"Saa Taa Naa Maa.\" What does Kirtan Kriya mean in English? A kirtan is a song. These ancient primal sounds from Sanskrit mean \"birth, life, death, rebirth.\" Kriya refers to a specific set of movements or chants. In the yogic tradition, kriyas are used to help bring the body, mind, and emotions into balance, thus creating healing.

The difference between meditators and non- meditators showed higher activity in the anterior cingulate, fronto - orbital cortex and insula DMN activity was largely suppressed throughout the course of Kirtan Kriya meditation, meaning that Meditation =Rest; Meditation has \"brain fitness effect.\"Yoga for mild cognitive impairment Yoga and Cognition: Meta- Analysis Studies in field: 15 RCTs and 7 acute exposure studies examined the effects of yoga on cognition. Result: Yoga practice seems to be associated with moderate improvements in cognitive function. Effect sizes : 0.33 for RCTs; 0.56 for acute studies.

The right hippocampus (A), left hippocampus (B), and dorsal ACC (C) are displayed in red on a representative subject's brain image.RESULTS The yoga group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in depression and visuospatial memory . In both groups, we observed improved verbal memory performance correlated with increased connectivity between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and frontal medial cortex, pregenual cortex (PCC), and left lateral occipital cortex. Improved verbal memory performance positively correlated with increased connectivity between the language processing network and the left inferior frontal gyrus. MET increased hippocampal volume, but not ACC, and language domain score at baseline inversely predicted change in hippocampal volumeA. The default mode network (DMN) is displayed in yellow on a template brain in neurological convention. Regions that exhibited significant correlations between changes in DMN connectivity and changes in HVLT delayed recall are shown in red (z > 2.3, p < 0.05, corrected). All correlations were positive, and significant clusters included the pregenual anterior lateral occipital cortex ( LOC). B.
