So how do we know these medicines are safe? Believe it or not, the answer comes from a \"living fossil ,\" which still inhabits the mid -Atlantic coast of the USA \u2014the amazing horseshoe crab. The latest film by award -winning film maker Tom Fitz , Horseshoe Cra bs: Prehistoric Paramedics , tells the fascinating story of the Atlantic horseshoe crab and its vital connection to human health and shorebirds . This 15 -minute educational film connects human health, environmental , and economic issues that are centered on the Atlantic horseshoe crab and its remarkable natural history. Viewers will learn how this animal 's unique immune system inspired scientists to develop an indispensible tool , which ensure s injectable medications are free of bacterial contaminants. But as horseshoe crab harvesting increases to supply international demands for eel and conch bait, ecologists learn that not only humans rely on this intriguing animal. Migratory shorebirds like the threatened red knot, which feed heavily on horseshoe crab eg gs during their northward migration , also declined in number as horseshoe crab harvesting pressure increased . Realizing the myriad values of the horseshoe crab , scientists, industries, and government agencies are now working together to maintain sustainable populations of the horseshoe crab. How to Use This Guide Horseshoe Crabs: Prehistoric Paramedics serves as an excellent discussion starter and entry point for students to learn about this primitive arthropod , its interesting adaptations, and its importance to human health and the environment. This guide can be used to supplement study of the Next Generation Sunshine State Science Standards, specifically alongside lessons covering organization and development of living organisms, comparisons of functions of organs and other physical structures in animals, diversity and evolution of living organisms, and interdependence of living things .

Its spiny shell, ten spiderlike legs, and spear -shaped tail all appear threatening . But as scary as the horseshoe crab may look, it is actually harmless. In fact, this amazing creature helps keep you safe . Each time you get an injection at a doctor's office, you can thank the horseshoe crab for protecting you from harmful bacteria. Read on to find out how ! LIVING FOSSILS Atlantic horseshoe crab s are a type of arthropod . They are found in the north eastern Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Despite their name , horseshoe crabs are not actually crabs. Th ey are more closely related to spiders and scorpion s. Horseshoe crab s are considered \"living fossil s.\" This means that the species living today is very similar to its early ancestors. In the case of the horseshoe crab , very little has changed in over 400 million years. BACTERIA BEWARE ! So how do horseshoe crabs keep you safe from bacteria? The answer is in its blue blood. Special cells in horseshoe crab blood can detect endotoxins, a harmful substance made by bacteria. When endoto xins are present , blood cells called amoebocytes release substances that cause the blood to form a gel. This keeps the bacteria from spreading further inside the horseshoe crab 's blood . A moebocytes then release a nother substance that kills bacteria. Humans may also be harmed if bacteria and their endotoxins enter our blood. It is very important that vaccines or other injected medicines are free of endotoxins . Fortunately, s cientists figured out a way to use horseshoe crab amoebocytes to detect dangero us bacteria . T he Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (or LAL) test is now used around the world to make sure medicines are free of endotoxins . David M. Goehring 5 KEY TERMS arthropod : A group of related animals that includes insects, spiders, centipedes, shrimp, and horseshoe crabs. Arthropods have jointed legs, many pairs of limbs, and a hard exoskeleton. bacteria : Tiny single -celled organisms that are everywhere. Some bacteria are harmful while others are helpful . endotoxin : A toxic substance formed by bacteria, which causes fevers. exoskeleton : A hard external body covering in some animals migration : The annual movement of animals over long distances in order to find more suita ble habitat as seasons change. spawn : The release of eggs in large numbers. vaccine : A mixture of killed microorganisms (bacteria or viruses) that is injected into the body. The vaccine helps the body's immune system recognize and fight the microorganis m if it enters the body at a later time . Here is how the test works. A sample of the medicine is diluted in water. Several drops of this mixture are placed in a vial containing horseshoe crab amoebocytes. If the liquid mixture forms into a gel, then the medicine is contaminated with bacteria and cannot be used. FISH FOOD Horseshoe crabs are not just important for human health. They are also important to the fishing industry. Horseshoe crabs are u sed as bait for eel and conch fishing . Harvesting horseshoe crabs for bait along the US Atlantic seaboard increased dramatically between 1970 and 1995. Eventually, horseshoe crab populations began to decline. NOT ONLY HELPFUL TO HUMANS Many s horebirds rely on horseshoe crab eggs for food . Each year, between April and June, horseshoe crab s emerge from the Atlantic Ocean to spawn on sandy beaches. Female horseshoe crabs bury thousands of eggs in the sand . Around this time, migratory shorebirds arrive from South America on their way to the arctic for summer breeding season. The birds are hungry and the abundant horseshoe crab eggs help supply them with energy to finish the voyage . The red kno t is one migratory shorebird that really counts on horseshoe crab eggs. When fishermen harvest too many horseshoe crabs, the red knot cannot find enough eggs to eat . As a result, the red knot population decline s. Many people worried the bird would become endangered. Today, scientists, industries , and governments are working to gether to protect the horseshoe crab and the red knot . By placing a limit on the number of harvested horseshoe crabs, the population is growing. Horseshoe crabs are once again easy to spot on beaches and the red knot s are returning . 6 You might be wondering... Why is horseshoe crab blood blue? Horseshoe crab blood has copper , which helps carry oxygen around the body . When there is plenty of oxygen, c opper turns blue . Human blood uses iron instead of copper to carry oxygen . Can you guess what color i ron turns when oxygen is present ? What do horseshoe crabs eat? Horseshoe crabs love to eat soft-shelled clams. They will also eat other arthropods and worms. Why does the horseshoe crab have so many eyes? The horseshoe crab has ten \"eyes\" that are located in different parts of its body . The eyes are used for different purposes , like finding mates or determining whether it is day or night. Despite having so many eyes, horseshoe crabs do not see very well. Can horseshoe crabs swim? Yes. Horseshoe crabs either crawl or swim. Strangely, horseshoe crabs always swim upside down. Scientists think that is why horseshoe crabs also have two eyes on their bottom side. ? What do you think? Do you think it is important for humans to protect horseshoe crabs from over fishing? Why or why not? Write your opinion using at least three reasons from the film or from your research to support your point of view. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Name_______________________ _____ 7 Draw lines to connect the horseshoe crab body part with its purpose.

Use the overlapping center to list at least five structures that both animals have. Use the outer circles to list five or more structures that are unique to each animal. Name_______________________ _____ 9 1. How do you think the horseshoe crab got its name? o Named for their horseshoe shape and crab -like appearance o Explain that this name is a common named used in everyday language o Explain that scientists use a different name (Limulus polyphemus ) to refer to the horseshoe crab. All scientists use this name, no matter what part of the world they are from or what language they speak. This ensures that all scientists know what species is being referred to and helps identify the relationships betwee n different species . o Explain that scientists discovered that the horseshoe crab is not actually a crab (Crustacean). It is more closely related to spiders and scorpions. Despite this, people still use the word \"crab.\" o Ask students if they can think of ot her common names that do not accurately describe the species. Examples may include: Dog fish Flying fox Guinea pig Jelly fish Koala bear Sea horse Sea lion Starfish 2. Scientists and citizens are trying to protect the horseshoe crab from overharvesting. Why should we care about horseshoe crabs? o Horseshoe crab blood is a vital tool for making safe medicines. o The LAL test is the best test available for ensuring there are no bacteria or bacterial toxins in vaccines and other medicines. o Ask students to consider the importance of horseshoe crabs to shorebirds like the red knot. o Explain to students that over -harvesti ng for fishing can cause the horseshoe crab population to drop so much that future supplies of fishing bait may not be available. HORSESHOE CRABS \u2014PREHISTORIC PARAMEDICS Discussion Questions/Writing Prompts Use the following questions to stimulate classroom discussion or as writing prompts. Either way, the goal is to foster discussion on the level of synthesis and analysis. Below each question, you will find supporting information and recommendations to facilitate classroom discussion . 10 3. What basic things do horseshoe crab s need in order to survive? o Students should recognize basic needs of an animal --Food , water, oxygen, shelter. o Explain to students that horseshoe crabs feed primarily on clams, but also smaller arthropods, and worms. o Horseshoe crabs require sea water . They are not found in freshwater habitats. o Horseshoe crabs need oxygen in their sea water, but can tolerate low levels . o Sandy beaches are important for horseshoe crabs. This is where they bury eggs. 4. What is the purpose of the horseshoe crab's exoskeleton (or shell) ? o Exoskeleton provides a rigid structure for the body and provides a prote ctive shield from predators and other dangers o Explain to students that, like all arthropods, horseshoe crabs do not have an internal skeletal system . o Ask students to give examples of other animals without a back bone or other bones. Point out that some invertebrates have a hard covering while others do not. o Discuss benefits and disadvantages of having a hard exoskeleton. Benefits include protection from predators and other threats, hard structure for tools (e.g., claws) Disadvantages include vulnerability during molting (i.e. soft shell phase) and difficulty moving through small spaces. 5. In the film we learned that horseshoe crabs grow by molting. The exoskeleton is shed and replaced with a new one. How is this different from how you grow? o Briefly explain the molting process to students (See the Exploration Activity below for background information .) o Ask students to consider the fundamental differences between this growth strategy and human growth. Students should recognize that humans have more or less continuous bone growth until they are adults. Humans do not replace their bones through a process like molting. 6. Why is it important to keep bacteria out of vaccines and other medicines that are injected into your body? o Discuss the role of ba cteria and other germs in human sickness. o Point out that our skin and other surfaces , which make contact with the environment act as a barrier to germs . mucus linings in sinuses and lungs tears in eyes acid in stomach 11 o Explain that when we inject a medicine into the bloodstream, all of the body's barrier defenses are bypassed. If there are bacteria or toxins in the medicine, our body is less able to defend itself. o Ask students to identify another situation when bacteria may easily enter the body (i.e., cuts and skin abrasions) . 7. We learned in the film that the red knot shorebird t ravels from the southern parts of South America (near Antarctica) to the Arctic every spring, then back to South America in the fall. Why do you think this bird flies so far every year? o Discuss reasons for migration. o Ask students if the red knot seems adapted to very cold places like Antarctica. Discuss the seasonal changes in temper ature, food and water availability, and nesting habitat near the north and south poles. o Ask students if they can think of other animals that migrate . 8. What would happen to the red kno t if horseshoe crabs did not arrive each spring to lay their eggs on th e Atlantic beaches? o Students may recall that red knots obtain a great deal of food energy from horseshoe crab eggs. Discuss the importance of this energy source for the remaining part of their migration. o Ask students what consequences there would be if the red knot did not have enough food. Discuss reproductive success and impact on populations. 9. Mother r ed knot s usually lay only four eggs . Both of the red knot parents stay with the hatchlings until they can fly. How is this strategy for reproduction and d evelopment different from the horseshoe crab? o Remind students that horseshoe crabs lay many eggs (usually around 2,000) and adults do not care for the eggs at all once they are laid. o Ask students if laying more eggs increases the likelihood that at least one offspring will survive to become an adult. o Ask students if caring for the eggs and hatchlings increases the likelihood of hatchling survival. o Point out that parents have only so m uch energy to make and care for their offspring. Explain that there is a trade -off in nature --use most of your energy to make many eggs and let the offspring fend for themselves or make fewer eggs and use the saved energy to take care of offspring after th ey hatch. 12 Exploration Activity : Modeling Molting TEACHER'S GUIDE How do horseshoe crabs grow if their shell s are hard? What is molting exactly? In this hands -on activity , students will create a physical model of an arthropod and simulate growth and molting. Students will use inflated balloons, news paper strips, and glue to build their model organism , and then illustrate the molting process by further inflating the balloon . Students will observe how the horseshoe crab and other arthropods shed their e xoskeleton and increase their body size. Follow -up questions will allow students to consider the benefits and disadvantages of the arthropod body plan and growth process. Class Time DAY 1 40-50 minutes for film viewing, introduction to activity, and model construction Optional --Assign Student Briefing as homework on Day 1 DAY 2 20 minutes for demonstration and discussion Note: A dd a n additional day for optional model painting and decoration , if time . Materials 9 to 12\" latex balloon s, one per student * small (12 to16 oz) paper cups, one per student spring -loaded paper clamps or clothe spins, one per student strips of news paper white g lue warm water cooking oil spray large shallow bowl s (one for every 3 -4 students) permanent marker (Sharpie\u00ae) Optional water -based paint materials for arthropod eyes and appendages (buttons, stickers, pipe cleaners) * Mylar balloons may be used as a substitute if latex allergy is a concern. 13 Background Information Molting is the process of shedding a part of an animal's body. This phenomenon occurs across a wide range of taxonomic groups including birds (feathers) , dogs (fur), reptiles (skin), and arthropods (exoskeleton). Many arthropods have an inflexi ble exoskeleton. In order to accommodate expanding body volume during growth, the exoskeleton is routinely shed and a new outer covering is formed. The physiological process of molting in arthropods involves the separation of the outer cuticle from the un derlying epidermal layer. After separation, a new cuticle is formed and enzymes digest the lower regions of the old cuticle . The arthropod then increases its body volume by taking in air or water. This causes the old shell to split along a seam, allowing t he animal to crawl out. The new exoskeleton is initially soft and may take hours or days to harden, depending on the species. This phase is often referred to as the soft-shelled stage (as with crabs). Arthropods are more vulnerable to predators during this phase. Horseshoe crabs and other aquatic arthropods will often bury themselves in the mud during the soft -shelled stage to avoid being spotted by a potential predator. Horseshoe crabs will molt several times each year for the first few years, then annually for several more years. Procedure Preparation Gather materials needed for the activity. Be sure clean -up facilities and supplies (wipes, soap, paper towels) are available for your students. Use art aprons if available. Set up stations with one balloon, one cup, and one clamp per student . Each student group of four should have a stack of paper strips and access to a glue bowl. Prior to class, mix equal parts of warm water and white glue in shallow bowls. Film Viewing Show the film, Horseshoe Crabs: Prehistoric Paramedics . After the film, discuss arthropod exoskeletons and the molting process using the discussion questions provided in this guide. Ask students to consider how horseshoe crabs can grow if their outer she ll is hard. Explain the concept of physical models and how scientists use them to understand how things work. 14 Model Construction Move students to their activity stations. Demonstrate the following steps and ask student s to follow along with their materials. Some students may need assistance. Inflate balloon until it is approximately 6\" wide (about the size of a cantaloupe) . Twist the end of the balloon but do not tie. While holding the twisted end, clamp it with the pap er cla mp or clothespin. Set the balloon in the cup (cup serves as a stand) . Once each student has an inflated balloon in the stand, use a permanent marker to draw a line along the longitudinal plane of the balloon. This represents the arthropod's exoskel eton seam \u2014the line of separation during the molting process. Allow the ink to dry, and then lightly spray the balloon with cooking spray. Paper Mach\u00e9 : Dip a strip of news paper in to the water/glue mixture . Place the strip of wet paper on to the balloon , making sure not to cross the seam line , as shown in the diagram . One strategy for this is to first apply paper strips parallel to each side of the line. The seam should be approximately 1/8\" wide. Once these strips are in place, the student can cover the remaining parts of the balloon using a crisscross pattern. No more than three layers of news paper should overlap. Once the top of the balloon is covered, turn it over in the cup stand and complete the bottom of the balloon taking care not to cover the twi sted end with paper. Inspect the balloon to verify that the seam is not covered with news paper and set the balloon back on the cup stand to dry. (After class, reposition the balloons slightly to minimize sticking to the cup. ) 15 Discussion After clean up, hold up a model and ask students what the news paper \"shell\" represents. Students should recognize that the news paper is a representation of the arthropods exoskeleton. What about th e balloon? It represents the inside parts of the arthropod. Explain that there are no bones inside an arthropod, only fluids and soft tissues. The paper mach \u00e9 models should be dry on Day 2. If optional decorating is desired, use a segment of the class per iod to paint and decorate the models to look like arthropods. For example, pipe cleaners can be used to make legs or the class could make paper mach \u00e9 telsons (tails) to attach to one end of the balloon. Once the model s are completed, ask students to recall what the news paper represents. Ask them what is different today about the exoskeleton. It is now dry and hard. Ask students how this hard outer skeleton helps the animal. Discuss the physical protection that is provided. Also point out that the shell provides structural support for the animal (without it, it would be a blob --like a jellyfish). Students may also recognize that the hard covering over appendages allows them to be used as tools ( e.g., claws, telsons). Use one of the models to demonstrate t he disadvantage of a hard outer shell when moving through tight spaces. Sho w how the model cannot squeeze between narrow passages (e.g., partially opened door). Molting Demonstration Now explain to the students that the arthropod is growing on the inside. It is accumulating more fluid , air, and soft tissues are growing. Remove the clamp (while holding the twisted end) and slowly inflate the balloon. Ask students to guess what the inflati on represents. Students will see that as the inner body expands, the exoskeleton separate s along the seam. The old exoskeleton is not flexible and is now too small for the growing arthropod. As the seam opens more, the arthropod is able to walk (or wiggl e) out of the old exoskeleton. Completed paper mach\u00e9 with continuous longitudinal seam Further inflation of balloon causes shedding of \"shell.\" 16 With care, the exoskeleton can be peeled away from the balloon without it popping . Explain that the arthropod now has a new exoskeleton, but it is still somewhat soft and flexible --much like the balloon when the paper mach \u00e9 was still wet on Day 1! Point out that the old exoskeleton is not used by the arthropod any more. Follow up Discussion Explain to the students that this soft exoskeleton will harden in a matter of hours or days (depending on the type of arthropod). Expl ain that during this time, arthropods will take in extra air or water to make their body grow even bigger. Discuss the vulnerabilities of the animal during this stage. Is the animal protected from predators when its shell "}
