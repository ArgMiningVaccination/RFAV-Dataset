Learn how Ayurveda helps with energy and endurance.", "sitename": "mapi.com", "date": "2022-09-06", "cleaned_text": "principles (or goals) that support \"high performance\", whether physical or mental. They are broadly summed up in three lifestyle strategies: - Reducing toxins (ama) - Balancing and strengthening digestion (agni) - Significantly lowering stress Under each of these key areas are a wide variety of tactics and sub-categories. Each of these three plays a powerful role in supporting high performance and wellness, short and long term, according to Ayurveda. Balance, strength, speed, endurance, resistance to stress Our mind and body perform at peak levels and recover quickly when they are balanced, low-stress, flexible, intuitive, responsive, and energetic. In Ayurveda, performance strategy goes beyond aerobics, muscle toning or a sole focus on isolated symptoms. To accomplish the three goals mentioned above, Ayurveda offers many options. Each has its own power to change and sustain a higher level of mind-body performance. The extent to which one can adopt these strategies will vary depending on each individual, but adopting one is good; the effects and results are cumulative, and all are easy to integrate into our lifestyles. These performance-oriented options include: - Changes in diet and routine - Using stress-reduction practices like yoga, exercise and meditation - A variety of traditional Ayurvedic herbals There are many other tools that support high performance for athletes and everyone else. They all have a cumulative, positive effect on performance. Digestion = energy, balance and performance Digestion is a central, long-term, priority focus of Ayurveda. Great emphasis is placed on keeping digestion (agni) balanced. It is an essential component for high-performance lifestyles where competition dominates. In this sense, \"balance\" means digestion is functioning at its absolute optimum. That's because agni is the engine of assimilation and transformation. Think of the engine of a car. If the ability to assimilate the fuel is hindered by poor fuel delivery (clogged lines) or by poor ignition (faulty electrical system), the car, although filled with fuel, will be unable to operate at peak performance. This transformation \"engine\" isn't found just in the stomach \u2014 it is found in every cell in the body. It is an extremely intelligent engine. It transforms and assimilates food nutrients and food intelligence into you, and eliminates that which isn't useful to the body and mind. Depending on the strength of our agni, either ama or ojas (the beneficial biochemical of balance) will be created. Ojas is the finest and most valued by-product of digestion in ayurveda, supporting energy, clarity, immunity, inner happiness, physical toning, intuition, judgment and peak emotional stability. All of these are qualities central to athletic performance, and all other performance. Whole-person versus \"isolated parts\" performance Ayurveda's strength lies in its \"whole person\" approach to high performance. This means it does not isolate a narrow area of health and exclude the rest of a person's life. There are specific Ayurvedic approaches supporting specific results, like faster muscle recovery time or reaction times, discussed below. But it's important to understand that each of these tools is one in a number of balance-creating, natural performance-enhancing tools available. Ayurveda takes a holistic approach that is much more powerful. This approach is summed up in a famous phrase in Ayurveda: \"Water the root to enjoy the fruit.\" The entire plant is watered, not an isolated part. Amalaki: A famous Ayurvedic berry for performance Of all the [rasayanas](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/top-seven-ayurvedic-behavioral-rasayanas) (Ayurvedic formulations revered for their positive influence on the physiology) the [amalaki ](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/the-legendary-ayurvedic-fruit-amalaki)(amla) fruit is considered one of the most potent and nourishing.

The only taste missing is salty. This gives it a holistic, balancing effect on the doshas. Very few fruits have this quality. This is the beauty of this fruit: it is tri-doshic, which means that it is pacifying to all three doshas (mind-body operating principles). It is good for all seasons, all weather conditions, and all body types. Rasayanas have many high-performance benefits. The Ayurvedic texts mention that they promote: - Longevity, memory, intelligence, youthfulness, strength and immunity of the body - Strength of the sense organs - The quality of purity (sattva) - A clear voice and sweet and successful speech - Respectability (due to a pure nature, good health, and prosperity) - Invincibility Amalaki is good for men and especially for women.
