INTRODUCTION The detection of clinically relevant molecules, including small molecules, nucleic acids, and proteins, is fundamental tounderstanding their biological and physiological functions andto developing clinical diagnostics. 1These molecules carry out many biological functions, including storing and transmittinggenetic information, regulating biological activities, transportingChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXBsmall molecules, and catalyzing reactions. Moreover, they can be used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of many diseases. Clinicalanalysis is no longer performed exclusively in clinicallaboratories. 2Instead, it is routinely carried out in several settings, including hospital point-of-care settings, by caregivers in nonhospital settings, and by patients at home.3Electrochemical detection systems are ideally suited for these new applications.4 Electrochemical sensing strategies have the potential to achieve rapid, sensitive, selective, and low-cost detection of biomolecular analyt es relevant to clinical diagnosis and monitoring treatment of disease.5A variety of strategies for target recognition and signal transduction have allowed thedevelopment of a vast array of electrochemical assays. Electro-chemical sensing platforms have been successfully transitioned from the central lab to the point-of-care for the detection of small molecules, such as glucose and lactate, using enzymaticapproaches. 6,7In contrast, detection of larger biomolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, requires further innovation toovercome challenging problems related to nonspeci c adsorp- tion of nontarget molecules and lack of enzyme/analyte pairs for many analytes.This Review will acquaint the reader with recently developed electrochemical approaches that can be deployed for analysis ofclinically relevant biomolecules. Examples of the biomolecularanalytes of interest as well as their reference values are providedinFigure 1 . This is a large and rapidly advancing eld, and this Review attempts to provide comprehensive coverage of the lastve years of progress to inform the selection of targets for future work. Overviews of di erent sensors are presented combined with important performance metrics including dynamic rangeand limit of detection (LOD). We also discuss the new frontiersin the eld and the challenges to be addressed. 2. ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOSENSORS An electrochemical biosensor is an integrated device that provides analytical information, either quantitative or semi-quantitative, using a biorecognition strategy involving anelectrochemical transducer (e.g., an electrode or eld-eect transistor). 8 2.1. Types of Electrochemical Biosensors Electrochemical techniques discussed in this Review can beorganized into ve main types, including voltammetric/ amperometric, impedimetric, conductometric, potentiometric, Figure 1. Reference ranges for clinically relevant small molecules, nucleic acids, and proteins sorted by mass. The value for bacterial nucleic acids corresponds to levels observed in clinical swab and urine specimens. The value for viral nucleic acids corresponds to levels observed in clinical swa b and urine specimens.Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXCandeld-eect transistor-based biosensors. The principles behind each approach Voltammetric/Amperometric Biosensors. Vol- electrode versus a reference electrode and measure thecurrent. The current arises from electrolysis by means of anelectrochemical oxidation or reduction at the working electrodeand is limited by the mass transport rate of the reactant moleculesfrom the bulk solution to the electrode interface. Voltammetricbiosensors measure current as the potential is ramped at a givenrate, and the current response is usually a peak or a plateau that isproportional to the concentration of analyte. Amperometricbiosensors allow the detection of an analyte by measuring thecurrent at a constant applied potential at the working electrodewith respect to the reference electrode. In this technique, thepotential is stepped directly to the desired value and the current isthen measured. Amperometric biosensors o er additional selectivity because their oxidation or reduction potential usedin analysis is typically characteristic of the analyte species. 9The dierent combinations of parameters, including potential ( E), current ( I), charge ( Q), and time ( t), make for a long list of electrochemical techniques. In this section, we will provide a brief summary of the techniques that were used throughout thisReview. 2.1.1.1. Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV). In LSV, the electrode potential is varied at a constant rate throughout thescan, and the resulting current is measured. 2.1.1.2. Alternating Current Voltammetry (ACV). During ACV an alternating potential is added to the DC potential rampused for LSV. Only the AC portion of the total current ismeasured and plotted versus the DC potential portion of thepotential ramp. 2.1.1.3. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). In CV, the applied potential is varied at a working electrode in both forward andreverse directions while monitoring the current. Depending onthe analysis, a partial cycle, one full cycle, or a series of cycles canbe carried out. CV is widely used for the study of redox processes,monitoring reaction intermediates, and stability assessment ofreaction products. 2.1.1.4. Chronoamperometry (CA). In CA, the current response is studied as a function of time after a potential steplarge enough to initiate a chemical reaction is applied to an electrode. 2.1.1.5. Chronocoulometry (CC). In a CC experiment, the charge used in an oxidation or reduction reaction is measuredand plotted versus to time. The excitation waveform used in CCis similar to that used in CA, but the resulting curve shows anincrease of charge with time, rather than the decrease of currentwith time that can be observed in CA. In addition, CC allows formore accurate determination of a kinetic rate constant. 2.1.1.6. Chronopotentiometry (CP). CP is a technique in which a constant current, or a current step, is applied to theelectrode and the resulting potential change is monitored overtime. 2.1.1.7. Pulse Methods. To improve the speed and sensitivity, many forms of potential modulation have been developed. Twoof these pulse techniques, including di erential pulse voltam- metry and square wave voltammetry, are widely used. 2.1.1.8. Di erential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). In this technique, the potential is scanned with a series of pulses withxed small amplitude (10 100 mV) and superimposed on a slowly changing base potential. The current is determined at twopoints for each pulse; the rst point is registered before the pulseapplication, and the second is taken at the end of the pulse. These sampling points are selected to allow for the decay of thenonfaradic (charging) current. The di erence between current measurements at these points is determined for each pulse andplotted as a function of the base potential. 2.1.1.9. Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV). In SWV, the excitation signal consists of a symmetrical square-wave pulse ofamplitude E swsuperimposed on a staircase waveform of step heightE, where the forward pulse of the waveform coincides with the staircase step. The net current is centered on the redoxpotential and is determined by measuring the di erence between the forward and reverse currents. SWV has several advantages,including its excellent sensitivity, speed, and discriminationagainst nonfaradic current. 2.1.1.10. Preconcentration and Stripping Techniques. These techniques have the lowest detection limits of any of thecommonly used electrochemical techniques. The three mostcommonly used preconcentration and stripping techniquesinclude anodic and adsorptive stripping voltammetry. Eventhough each technique has its own unique features, all have two steps in common. First, the target analyte in the sample solution is concentrated onto the working electrode. In thesecond step, the preconcentrated analyte is stripped from theelectrode surface by the application of potential and measured.Potential waveforms can be used in the stripping step, such aslinear sweep, di erential pulse, and square wave. The most common are the di erential pulse or square wave due to their abilities to discriminate against charging current. In addition,square wave has the added advantages of rapid scan rate andenhanced sensitivity as compared to di erential pulse. 2.1.1.11. Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV). In ASV, the metal ions in a sample are concentrated onto the electrodesurface by application of a negative potential. The metals are thenoxidized and stripped o of the electrode surface by scanning to positive potentials. The peak currents that result are correlated tothe concentration of each metal in the sample solution. Inaddition, the position of the peak potential is characteristic foreach metal. ASV is widely used for the determination of tracemetals and has a detection limit of parts per trillion. 2.1.1.12. Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV). In CSV, the anions in a sample are concentrated on the electrode surfaceby applying a positive potential. A negative potential scan willthen strip out the deposited lm. This method has been used to analyze halides. cathodic stripping techniques. The maindierence is that preconcentration occurs via adsorption on the electrode surface or by a speci c reaction at a chemically modied electrode rather than by accumulation via electrolysis. The adsorbed species is quanti ed by measuring a voltammetric response, the amplitude of which is proportional to theconcentration of the species. Many organic and inorganic speciescan be and capacitiveproperties of upon of the system by asmall amplitude sinusoidal AC excitation signal ( 210 mV). The frequency is changed over a wide range to obtain animpedance spectrum. The in-phase and out-of-phase currentresponses are then measured to determine the resistive andcapacitive components of the circuit. At high frequency, the migration rate of the redox species to the electrode surfaceChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXDbecomes rate limiting, and thus analytes that block access to the electrode surface can generate a frequency-dependent phase lagbetween the Conductometric biosensors measure changes in the electrical conductivity of a sample solution as the composition of thesolution changes during a chemical reaction. Conductometricbiosensors often include enzymes whose charged products causechanges in the ionic strength of the sample solution. 10In general, capacitive biosensors have the advantage that capacitance measurements are more indicative of the insulating properties of the biosensor.11Even minor desorption of the sensing layer is usually translated into an increase in the capacitance baseline.12 In addition, capacitive sensors are less c binding. 2.1.4. Potentiometric Biosensors. Potentiometric bio- sensors measure the potential of an electrochemical cell while drawing negligible current. These sensors usually contain anelectrochemical cell with two reference electrodes capable ofmeasuring the potential across an ion-selective membrane thatreacts with the charged ion of interest. Biological elements such as enzymes are commonly integrated into potentiometric sensors to catalyze the reaction that forms the ion, which can be detectedby the underlying electrode. change in source-drain channel conductivity arising from the electric eld of its environment. The electrical conductance of the channel is proportional to its carrier density, and this is readily sensed via the change in the source-drain voltage current.13 Of all of these methods, voltammetric approaches are the most widely deployed. This type of measurement strategy has the mostflexibility, and the signals that are generated are straightforward to interpret. 2.2. Biosensor Recognition Elements Molecular recognition is central to biosensing. Initially, biosensorrecognition elements were obtained from living systems.However, many recognition elements are synthetic and havebeen prepared in the laboratory. The recognition element plays a crucial role in the overall biosensor performance and selectivity toward a particular analyte. Recognition elements currently usedin the preparation of electrochemical sensors for clinicallyrelevant biomolecules include antibodies, antibody fragments,enzymes, receptors, lectins, acids, aptamers, peptide locked nucleic acids, and molecularly imprinted polymers. 2.2.1. Antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system. They feature antigen recognition sites, whichcan bind to their respective antigens by noncovalent interactionswith relatively high a nity. The antigen-binding fragments of the molecules comprise the heavy chain variable region (V H) and the light chain variable region (VL). Both fragments fold to provide a perfect t for the speci c antigen. Frequently, sensor design makes use of antibody sandwiches, where capture antibodies areimmobilized onto the surface of the sensor, while labeledreporter antibodies bind to the analyte to provide a signal. Antibodies could be either polyclonal or monoclonal. In contrast to polyclonal antibodies, which are produced by di erent immune cells, monoclonal antibodies are produced by identicalimmune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Inaddition, they have monovalent a nity and bind to the same epitope within the antigen. 142.2.2. Antibody Fragments. For sensing applications, only the antigen-binding fragment of the antibody is required forbiomolecular recognition, while the crytallizable fraction is notinvolved in target binding. Smaller antibody fragments havemore de ned immobilization sites through thiol groups liberated after cleavage of the whole antibody molecule. In addition, thesesmall fragments could be more densely packed onto the sensorsurface, thus improving the interaction with the target analyte. Enzymatic cleavage of antibodies is one way to produce antigen- binding fragments. Phage display and ribosome displaytechniques for antibody gene cloning and expression are otheralternatives to produce single chain variable fragments. Thesefragments feature the V Hand V Ldomains connected by a flexible polypeptide linker that can be designed to have desirableproperties for immobilization.15 2.2.3. Enzymes. Enzymes are catalytic proteins with an active site that has some features similar to those of antigen-bindingfragment of antibodies, that is, exquisite speci city for certain molecules, known as their substrates. Enzymes are not only usedas recognition elements per se, but are commonly conjugated to asecondary recognition element to allow for signal ampli cation. Of all enzyme recognition element-based biosensors, glucosebiosensors are the most widely studied and used. 16 2.2.4. Receptors. Receptors are transmembrane and soluble proteins that bind to speci c molecules called ligands to initiate a specic cellular response. Receptor preparations are attractive recognition elements because they can bind to their ligands withhigh a nity and selectivity. Nevertheless, their low yield, relative instability, tedious isolation methods, and transduction di cul- ties have signi cantly impeded the pursuit of receptor-based sensing. However, recombinant techniques are currently used togenerate large amounts of receptor proteins, thus alleviatingmany of the earlier logistical issues. 2.2.5. Lectins. Lectins represent a broad family of proteins involved in many biological processes. They generally exhibitstrong binding a nities to speci c carbohydrates, known as glycans. Their speci c binding has been exploited in biosensor design. 17Although there are a variety of ligand-speci c lectins available, Concanavalin A remains one of the most widely usedlectins for carbohydrate detection. 2.2.6. Whole Cells. The term whole cells often refers to microbial cells. In whole cell-based sensors, the whole cellularmachinery functions as a recognition system for the targetanalyte. For instance, bacterial cells can be induced to produceamino acid metabolizing enzymes that can be used in thedetection of that particular amino acid. 18 2.2.7. Peptides/Proteins. Using techniques such as phage, bacterial, and ribosome display, it is now possible to producepeptides/proteins with strong binding a nities to speci c ligands. In each technique, iterative rounds of a nity puri cation are employed to produce proteins/peptides with desired bindingproperties. 19The unique feature of phage display is that the production of 107108short peptides on the surface of lamentous phages can be achieved via the fusion of an epitope library of DNA sequences and one of several coat proteins. These peptides are screened, and candidates exhibiting speci c binding properties can be integrated into many analytical platforms. Forexample, a number of peptide- and protein-based electro-chemical sensors have been described in the literature, many ofwhich feature impressive sensitivity and selectivity. 2026 2.2.8. Nucleic Acids. In classical nucleic acid-based sensors, referred to as genosensors, the biorecognition process involves noncovalent interactions between bases of comple-Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXEmentary nucleic acid strands and is manifested by hybridization between an immobilized capture probe and a complementarytarget sequence.27,28The immobilized nucleic acid could be either a stem-loop probe (SLP) or linear probe (LP).2931In SLP sensors, the probe is usually tagged with a redox label that ispositioned in proximity to the electrode surface in absence of the target sequence. Upon hybridization with the target sequence, theflexibility of redox-labeled probe is hindered, diminishing the electron transfer e ciency (signal-OFF).32In LP sensors, the redox-labeled probe is highly flexible in the absence of the target sequence. Target hybridization induces a change in probedynamics, leading to a reduction of the redox current (signal-OFF). 33A signal-ON sensor is fabricated using a redox-labeled linear DNA probe containing a flexible linker. Target hybrid- ization induces the formation of \"close \"structure, positioning the redox label close to the sensor surface and subsequently resulting in an increase in the redox current.34,35Displacement-based genosensors represent another class of signal-ON sensors inwhich the capture probe is partially hybridized with a redox-labeled DNA. In the presence of the target sequence, a newhybrid is formed and the redox-labeled DNA is released to form ahairpin structure, thus bringing the redox label close to theelectrode surface and consequently resulting in an increase inredox current. 3638interestingly, nucleic acids are used as recognition elements to develop electrochemical ion sensors. Inthe absence of the target ion, the redox-labeled thymine- containing DNA probes are highly flexible, enabling e cient electron transfer between the electrode and redox label. Bindingof Hg(II) or Au(III) rigidi es the probe, resulting in in redox current (signal-OFF). 39,40 2.2.9. Aptamers. Aptamers are that are isolated from libraries of oligonucleotides by an in vitro selection process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments (SELEX).41,42In contrast to base pairing exhibited by nucleic acids, aptamers can fold to form highly speci c three- dimensional structures due to their self-annealing properties.The selectivity and binding a nity of aptamers can be similar to those of the corresponding antibodies. However, the selectiv-ity 43,44and binding a nity45of aptamers can be tailored during the selection process. Another advantage of aptamers overantibodies is that they are inherently stable, so that they can besubjected to numerous rounds of denaturation and renaturation, thus allowing for an easy regeneration of the sensor surface. Aptamers are produced by chemical synthesis after selection andsequencing, and so they can be readily modi ed to enhance their anity and stability. A variety of electrochemical aptamer-based sensors (aptasensors) have been fabricated to detect a plethora ofanalytes ranging from small molecules 46to large microorgan- isms4750and cells.51,52Many signal-ON aptasensors rely on the formation of a layer of partially unfolded redox-labeled aptamerprobe on the electrode surface. Upon binding to the target, theprobe forms a \"close \"structure 53or a \"three-way junction \",54,55 thus bringing the redox label in proximity to the electrode surface and subsequently increasing the redox current. Catalytic aptamers called aptazymes (RNAzymes and DNAzymes) are possessing thatconvert recognition of target analytes into catalytically generated signals. DNAzymes can be easily engineered to detect many classes of biological molecules. In addition, DNAzymes canbe repeatedly denatured without losing with a polyamide backbone instead of the sugarphosphate backbone. The uncharged nature of PNAs is mainly responsible for the thermal stability of PNA DNA hybrids as compared to DNA DNA equivalents. Hence, single-base mismatches in PNA/DNA hybrids have a considerable more destabilizing e ect that can be easily interrogated. PNAs are resistant to nucleases and proteases. In addition, PNAs can formhigher order complexes (3- and 4-stranded) with DNA. Hence,they can be used for the detection of double-stranded DNA(dsDNA) directly without thermal denaturation. 59 2.2.11. ismodied methylene linkage connecting the 2 oxygen and 4c a r b o n .T h eb r i d g el o c k st h er i b o s ei nt h e3 -endo conformation. LNAs to Watson Crick base-pairing rules to form highly stable hybrids that are compatible with most enzymes.60 2.2.12. Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs). Molec- ular imprinting is a method for making selective binding sites insynthetic polymers using molecular templates. Followingpolymerization, the template molecule is extracted from the polymeric matrix using a suitable solvent or by chemical cleavage, leaving a cavity within the polymeric matrix, which can be used tocapture the target analyte. MIPs o er great promise for the production of stable \"solid-state like \"synthetic recognition elements. 61,62MIPs have been successfully utilized to develop sensing platforms for small molecules (200 1200 Da range). Detection of larger biomolecules remains challenging becausethe formation of the template cavity to conform to the three-dimensional image of the biomolecule may be di cult. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that MIPs can be fabricated using biomolecular templates such as presented by a protein cancer marker, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125, molecularweight 200 kDa), enabling a subsequent binding of thosetargets. 63 2.3. Integrated Electrochemical Assays As compared to carrying out electrochemical analysis in bulksolution, micro fluidics can speed up the interaction between the recognition element and the target analyte by reducing thedistance required for interaction. Smaller channel dimensionslead to smaller sample volumes, which can subsequently reduce the amount of sample and reagents required for analysis. Reduced dimensions can also lead to miniaturized portabledevices that can enable on-site analysis. Finally, integration ofmultiple processes, such as labeling, separation, and detection, ina micro fluidic device is highly amenable for many applica- tions. 6466 Micro fluidic platforms are ceramics69), polymers (e.g., elastomers70and thermoplastics71), and paper.72The choice of material depends on the application, detection system,fabrication facility, cost, and other factors including thermal conductivity, sealing properties, and resistance to di erent chemicals. Silicon, glass, and ceramics are more expensive andlessflexible to work with, as compared to polymers. Fabrication of polymer-based micro fluidics does not have stringent require- ment on clean room facility. Within the past few years, paper- based micro fluidic devices have been widely used as a lower-cost microfluidic platform. 73 The majority of single-step electrochemical assays are based on microfluidic devices integrated with embedded electrodes or electrode arrays.46,7478These devices were predominantly made from elastomers (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS),Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 and paper. 2.3.1. PDMS-Based Micro fluidic Devices. PDMS is one of the most widely used elastomers as it is cheap, elastic, and cures atlow temperature. In contrast to other polymers, PDMS is gaspermeable, which can be advantageous for O 2and CO 2transport in cellular studies. However, bubble formation caused by passageof gas through PDMS can cause technical problems. Because ofits hydrophobicity, PDMS is prone to molecules. 79Chemical modi cation of PDMS can often address these problems. In addition, plasmaexposure can hydrophilize the exposed PDMS surface but only lasts for a short period.80Although PDMS is one of the most widely used materials to fabricate cost-e ective micro fluidic platforms, the fabricated devices have some limitations as well.PDMS swells in organic solvents and low molecular weightorganic solutes. It cannot withstand high temperature, and itsmechanical stability is quite low. There are several methodsavailable for the fabrication of PDMS devices including softlithography, casting, imprinting, injection molding, hot emboss-ing, and laser ablation. 81,82Importantly, multiple layers can be stacked to create complex micro fluidic designs.83In recent years, several PDMS-based micro fluidic devices were designed to allow for ecient capture of circulating tumor cells.8488Several PDMS-based micro fluidic devices integrated with electro- chemical sensors have been developed for the analysis ofclinically relevant proteins, such as the polymerization of methyl methacrylate, is widely known under the name lucite and Plexiglas. PMMApatterns can be formed by injection molding or hot embossing.Several advantages of this material include gas impermeability,biological compatibility, and ease of micromachining at relativelylow temperatures ( \u00b0C). 92PMMA o ers better perform- ance than PDMS under mechanical stress. In addition, it does notrequire long fabrication a nd curing time. PMMA-based mutlilayered devices can be completely fabricated in few hours.PMMA-based micro fluidic devices integrated with electro- chemical sensors have been employed for the analysis of clinically relevant proteins, such as -fetoprotein Paper is a flexible, cellulose-based material that has recently emerged as a promising micro fluidic substrate for several reasons: (1) paper can transport liquids via the capillary e ect without the assistance of an external force; (2) inkjet and solid wax printing enable facilefunctionalization and pattern de nition; (3) paper is biologically compatible and can be chemically modi ed; (4) the high surface to volume ratio provided by the macroporous structures in paperimproves the immobilization of recognition elements, allowingfor rapid detection; (5) paper-based micro fluidic devices can be fabricated both in 2D and in 3D for either horizontal and verticalflow; and (6) the material can be easily disposed by natural degradation. Electrochemical detection in paper micro fluidics wasrst demonstrated using a three-electrode design to analyze clinically relevant small molecules, such as glucose, lactate, and uric acid in human serum. 72 Integration of electrochemical detection into paper-based microfluidic devices has led to the development of several low- cost, easy-to-use portable diagnostic devices. Micro fluidic channels can be fabricated on cellulose paper and wax-patterned paper using photolithography. Electrodes can be fabricated byseveral methods, including screen-printing, direct writing with a pen dispensing conductive material, spraying conductive inksthrough stencils, and physical deposition of metals. However,screen-printing remains the most convenient method forelectrode fabrication. 95Paper-based micro fluidic devices inte- grated with electrochemical sensors have been used in theanalysis of clinically relevant small molecules, such as glucose,lactate, and uric acid, 96and proteins, such as carcinoembryonic antigen,97,98-fetoprotein,97cancer antigen 125,97and immu- noglobulins.99 3. ELECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SMALL MOLECULES Clinically relevant endogenous small molecules and ions include neurotransmitters, metabolites, vitamins, amino acids, dietaryminerals, and other small biomolecules. In this section, we reviewseveral approaches adopted for the selective detection of smallmolecules and ions, including: (i) using speci c biorecognition elements as antibodies, biological receptors, in case detection; (ii) theuse of conducting lms and electrocatalytic electrode-coating materials to enhance the response current and reduce theoverpotential to minimize the interference caused by otherelectrochemical analogues; (iii) using nanostructured interfacesto amplify the signal and subsequently improve the temporalresolution of the sensor; and (iv) chemometrics that resolve theoverlapping signals of the target small molecules and otherinterfering species. Combinations of two or more of theseapproaches have also been pursued to improve the analyticalperformance of biosensors. 3.1. Neurotransmitters Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemical messengers thattransmit, enhance, and convert speci c signals between neurons and other cells. Neurotransmitters include dopamine, acetylcho-line, serotonin, epinephrine, no repinephrine, and tryptamine. A variety of electrochemical methodsare available for the measurement of these analytes both in vitroand in vivo. 3.1.1. Dopamine (DA). DA is a catecholamine neuro- transmitter widely present in the central nervous system. Itinfluences a variety of motivated behaviors, attention span, and neuronal plasticity and plays a critical role in memory andlearning. Altered levels of DA have been implicated in severalneurological disorders including Parkinson 's disease and schizophrenia. 100The normal values of DA in blood range from 10 to 480 pM.101Monitoring of DA, in the presence of other chemical analogues such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,serotonin, ascorbic acid, uric acid, catechol, phenethylamine,tyramine, and tyrosine, is crucial in the diagnosis and mechanisticunderstanding of human neuropathology. A voltammetric immunosensor for DA was designed on the basis of magnetic particles (MPs) coated with anti-DAmonoclonal antibody. 102Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were adsorbed on the surface of the MPs. The magnetic entrapment of the CNT/MP hybrids onto a gold screen-printed electrodeplaced on top of a magnet allowed for straightforwardelectrochemical sensing of DA by exploiting CNTs as a wiringtool. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) permitted the determination ofDA level in the linear range from 780 pM to 50 M, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 120 nM.Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXGAn amperometric aptasensor for DA was fabricated on the basis of the electrostatic interactions between a negatively charged DA-speci c aptamer and a positively charged cyste- amine-modi ed gold electrode.103The sensor allowed for quanti cation of DA over the range from 100 nM to 5 M. In addition, interference from ascorbic and uric acid was rendered negligible by coating the sensor surface with a Na on-coated membrane. Recently, the aptamer a nity to DA was enhanced by 1 order of magnitude via regulating the electrostatic immobilization ofthe aptamer.104Under optimal conditions, the dissociation constant of aptamer was 0.12 \u00b10.01M as compared to 1.6 \u00b10.17 M in solution. Remarkably, the amperometric sensor demonstrated more robustness and allowed for a more selective determination of DA level in the range from 100 nM to 2 M, with negligible interference from structurally related catechol- amines. A FET-based aptasensor for DA was recently developed in which a multiple-parallel-connected silicon nanowire eld-eect transistor (MPC/SiNW-FET) was modi DA-speci aptamer ( Figure 2 ).105As compared to conventional electro- chemical methods, the nanoelectronic device lowered the LOD of DA to 100 pM and did so even in the presence of other chemical analogues. A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for DA was prepared using a coreshell composite of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and biocompatible porous sol gel SiO2preformed on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE).106The template DAmolecules were rst adsorbed on the GNPs surface; then they were further assembled onto the polymer membrane via hydrogen bonding and interactions between the template molecules and the silane monomers. Subsequently, CV wascarried out to strip out the DA molecules from the imprinted membrane. Di erential pulse voltammetry (DPV) permitted the measurement of DA in the linear range from 48 nM to 50 M, with a LOD of 20 nM. To enhance further the selectivity of MIP-based detection of DA, a combination of boronic acid functional groups and molecularly imprinted cavities of poly(aniline- co-anthranilic acid) (PANANA) was utilized as the support material. 107This receptor, which bore a covalent ester linkage to DA via boronic acid, was employed as a recognition element for DA. The doublerecognition through the boronic acid and the shape of the cavitiesendowed the sensor with high selectivity toward DA. DPV measurements revealed a linear relationship between the peak current and DA concentration in the range from 10 nM to 10M, with a LOD of 3.3 nM. An enzymatic implantable microbiosensor is also available for in vivo monitoring of DA. 108The biosensor was fabricated using matrixcomprising chitosan and ceria-based metal oxides, and was deposited onto the surface of a carbon ber microelectrode. Tyrosinase catalyzed the conversion of DA to o-dopaquinone, and the reduction of the product was detected at low potential. This amperometric sensor demonstrated a linear range of 5 orders of magnitude between 10 nM and 220 M, with a LOD of 1 nM. Another DA speci c enzyme, laccase, was utilized to construct an amperometric sensing platform for DA via laccase-catalyzed oxidation and intramolecular cyclization of DA. 109In this approach, the enzyme was immobilized onto magnetite nano- particles con ned in a fused-silica capillary using an external magnetic eld. The resultant magnetic bioreactor was then placed upstream relative to an electrochemical flow cell. Laccase catalyzed the oxidation of DA into a quinonoid form and thereby initiated a series of sequential reactions, including deprotonation, intramolecular cyclization, and oxidation to yield 5,6-dihydrox-yindoline quinone. The electrochemical reduction of the product on the surface of a GCE provided the readout for DA measurement, as shown in Figure 3 . The amperometric sensor allowed for the detection of 2 Mo fD Ai nt h eb r a i n Figure 2.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXHmicrodialysate, without signi cant interference from uric acid and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Another enzyme-based sensing platform for DA was constructed on the basis of a mixture of horseradish peroxidase(HRP) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Thelatter were immobilized onto the surface of a carbon pasteelectrode coated with a calibration curve of DA was obtained in the range from 15 to 865 M, with a LOD of 6 M. Sensors coated with conducting lms have also been employed for selective detection of DA.111In one study, the aromatic stacking and electrostatic attraction between the positivelycharged DA and negatively charged porphyrin-functionalizedgraphene electrode were found to accelerate electron transferbetween the DA and the electrode surface. In contrast, oxidationof anionic interferents, such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, wasinhibited at the negatively charged porphyrin-modi ed surface. DPV permitted the analysis of DA level, with a LOD of 10 nM. In a related approach, a screen-printed carbon electrode was pretreated with an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate, forDA analysis. 112It was observed that the sodium dodecyl sulfate pretreatment had caused the DA oxidation peak to shiftcathodically and became clear ly distinguishable from the oxidation peaks of ascorbic and uric acid. Using square wavevoltammetry (SWV), a calibration curve of DA was obtained inthe range from 1 to 100 M, with a LOD of 370 nM. Silicon carbide-coated GCEs have also been utilized for selective detection of DA in the presence of interferents. 113SWV permitted the interrogation of the DA level in the linear rangefrom 0.2 to 35 M, with a LOD of 50 nM. Nanomaterial-based interfaces have also been utilized for selective DA analysis.114In one study, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with carboxylic groups and assembled onto a carbon- ber disk electrode modied with a thin, iron hydroxide-decorated, Na onlm. The surface modi cation allowed for a 9-fold increase in temporal resolution as compared to the bare electrode. Fast-scancyclic voltammetry (FSCV) permitted a sensitive dopamineanalysis, with a LOD of 17 nM. In another approach to enhance the selectivity of DA analysis using nanostructured surfaces, the electrooxidation of DA was investigated on the surface of ve dierent classes of carbon electrodes. 115These included a GCE, boron-doped diamond, and the basal surface ofhighly oriented pyrolitic graphite, encompassing ve distinct grades and coverage varying by more than 2 orders of magnitude.Of all of the ve carbon electrode types, the highly oriented pyrolitic graphite showed the clearest signal at a lowconcentration of DA (10 M). Interestingly, repetitive voltammetry caused the products of ascorbic acid oxidation toadsorb onto the surface, forming a perm-selective layer thatallowed an unimpeded electrochemical oxidation of DA, whilesignicantly inhibiting the electrochemical response of ascorbic acid. Using nanostructured interfaces coated with electroactive materials, the selectivity of DA sensors has been enhancedsignicantly. A sensor coated with a three-layered lm, consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene) as the internal and externallayer and poly( N-methylpyrrole) as the intermediate layer, was utilized for voltammetric analysis of DA. 116The sensitivity of the three-layered electrode was further enhanced by coating itssurface with GNPs. Using CV, the level of DA was determined, with a LOD of 10 M and 2 3M in the presence and absence of interferents, respectively. Chemometrics represents an alternative means to improve the selectivity of assays using mathematical and statistical methodsrather than interfacial design techniques. Mutivariate curve resolution using a least-squares approach has been used for s e l e c t i v ed e t e r m i n a t i o no fD Ai nt h ep r e s e n c eo fo t h e rcatecholamines. 117Chemometrical analysis of the DPV data using an alogarithm to correct the potential drift in the voltammetric response allowed for the analysis of a wide concentration range of DA extending from 0.1 to 205 M, with a LOD of 35.5 nM. 3.1.2. Acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is a neurotransmitter that acts as a key link in the communication between the neurons inthe spinal cord and the nerve skeletal junctions in vertebrates.ACh is found in the preganglionic and motor neurons that a ect cognition, learning, memory, and muscle tone. A variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson 's disease, myas- thenia gravis, and Alzheimer 's disease are correlated with dysfunctional ACh regulation. The normal values of ACh in blood range between 7.6 and 9.7 nM. 118The release of this neurotransmitter occurs at the millisecond time scale, thusrequiring a rapid and sensitive method for its detection. One approach for ACh detection that is available relies on M1 muscarinic ACh receptor expressed in E. coli and subsequently immobilized onto the surface of a SWCNTs-based FET, thusenabling sensitive and selective detection of ACh. 119This sensor system provided the rst demonstration of real-time detection of ACh. The sensor allowed highly sensitive detection of ACh, witha LOD of 100 pM. An enzymatic microbiosensor for choline (Ch) and ACh was lm choline oxidase (ChO), were coimmobilized onto the surface of a poly( o-phenylenediamine)- modied carbon ber microelectrode. The electrode assembly was completed by depositing MWCNTs and Na on. This amperometric sensor permitted the analysis of ACh and Ch levels, with a LOD of 45 nM. To enhance the sensitivity of enzyme-based ACh sensors, an enzymatic sensor was designed to work at near monolayercoverage. 121Reducing the enzyme layer thickness was found to improve the temporal resolution of the sensor by reducing the diusion time of the enzyme product. In this work, two enzymes, AChE and ChO, were coimmobilized onto the surface of a GNPs-modi ed carbon ber microelectrode at an optimized ratio of 1:10 AChE/ChO for most e cient sequential enzymatic activity. Amperometric detection of ACh was linear over therange from 10 M to 4 mM, with a LOD of 10 M. Another enzyme-based sensing platform relied on two enzymes, ChO and catalase coimmobilized onto magnetitenanoparticles and con ned within a fused-silica capillary using an external magnet. 122The bienzyme microreactor was placed between an in vivo microdialysis system and an electrochemical detector to suppress the interference of Ch toward AChdetection. Selective detection of ACh was achieved using AChE and ChO as the recognition units for ACh and Prussian blue as the electrocatalyst for H 2O2reduction. Electrochemical measurements revealed a linear relationship between theamperometric current and ACh concentration in the range from 5 to 100 M, with a LOD of 1 M.Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXIThe use of nanostructured electrodes for ACh detection has also been reported. An amperometric sensor was fabricated usingnanopipette electrodes with diameters ranging from 14 and 70nm. 123The sensor distinguished between ACh, tryptamine, and serotonin at half wave transfer potentials ( E1/2)o f0.11,0.25, and0.47 V, respectively. When amperometry was used, the current was proportional to ACh concentration in the range from250M to 6 mM, with a LOD of 205 M. 3.1.3. Serotonin. Also known as HT), serotonin is a major monoamine neurotransmitter andneuromodulator that contributes to a variety of biological andpsychopathological processes, including sleep regulation, depression, eating disorders , autism, alcoholism, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis. Thenormal values of 5-HT in blood range between 0.6 and 1.6M. 101 A variety of electrochemical sensing platforms for 5-HT have relied on -cyclodextrin as a recognition element, leveraging its ability to form a stable inclusion complex with 5-HT. A carbonpaste electrode was modi ed with a composite of -cyclodextrin, N-acetylaniline, and MWCNTs to construct an electrochemical sensor for 5-HT.124Using amperometry, the 5-HT level was determined in the linear range from 4 to 200 M, with a LOD down to the sub-micromolar level. The use of speci c ligands for 5-HT has also been pursued, including in an electrochemical sensor based on a mixed layer ofcaptopril and thiophenol self-assembled onto the surface of agold electrode. 125The 5-HT molecules were selectively captured via the formation of a strong complex with the layer, providing ananodic stripping current upon anodic scan or increase in thecharge-transfer resistance to a redox probe due to the blockingeect of the formed complex. Di erential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) and EIS were successfully used for 5-HT detection with LOD values of 28 and 1.2 nM, respectively. Real-time analysis of 5-HT in biological samples was also demonstrated using a carbon ber microelectrode for the quanti cation of 5-HT secreted from a platelets suspension. 126 Notably, this electrode was chosen due to its excellent temporal resolution, high sensitivity, and ability to provide a cyclicvoltammogramic signature for 5-HT identi cation. Using FSCV, the sensor allowed for a sensitive detection of 5-HT, with a LOD of 360 pmol/10 7platelets. In a closely related approach, a Wireless Instantaneous Neurotransmitter Concentration System (WINCS) was pro-duced to support FSCV at a carbon ber microelectrode for real- time measurement of 5-HT.127Optimized for 5-HT detection, FSCV consisted of an N-shaped waveform scanned linearly froma resting potential of +0.2 to +0.1 V then to 0.1 V and back to +0.2 V at a rate of 1000 V s 1. The sensor permitted the detection of 10 M of 5-HT in the dorsal raphe nucleus of rat brain slices after neurotransmitter release was provoked electrically. 3.1.4. Epinephrine (Ep). Ep, also known as adrenalin, is and neurotransmitter secreted by the medulla of theadrenal glands. It is also produced at the ends of sympatheticnerve bers and serves as a chemical mediator for conveying nerve impulses to the e ector organs. Ep is mainly responsible for activating the sympathetic system associated with the energy and excitement of the ght-or- flight response. The in fluence of Ep is mainly limited to metabolic and bronchodilation e ects on organs devoid of direct sympathetic innervations. The normalvalues of Ep in blood range from 20 and 460 pM. 101 A MIP-based sensor for Ep was constructed using CNTs bearing a terminal monomeric unit and entailing N-hydrox-yphenyl maleimide functionality as a polymeric network with simultaneous imprinting of Ep as a template molecule.128The MIP was cast onto a pencil graphite electrode (PGE). Using DPASV, the Ep level was determined in the linear range from 0.5 to 32 nM, with a LOD of 10.9 nM. In another nanomaterial-based approach, an electrochemical sensor for Ep was made on the basis of oxidized single-wall carbon nanohorns.129DPV permitted the analysis of Ep level in the linear range from 2 to 2.5 M, with a LOD of 0.1 M. A similar strategy was adopted using a GCE modi ed with nickel oxide nanoparticles and dihexadecylphos- phate lm allowed for the quanti cation of Ep within the linear range from 0.3 to 9.5 M, with a LOD of 82 nM. Selective detection of Ep was also achieved with porous diamond-like carbon electrodes.131Using CV, interrogation of Ep levels was achieved in the linear range from 10 to 100 M, with a LOD of 4.5 M. 3.1.5. Norepinephrine (NE). NE, also known as nora- drenalin, is a hormone and neurotransmitter released from the sympathetic neurons to a ect the heart. As a stress hormone, NE aects the amygdala in the brain where attention and vigilant concentration are controlled.132In addition, NE also underlies theght-or- flight response along with Ep by directly increasing the heart rate, triggering the release of glucose from energy stores and increasing the blood flow to skeletal muscles. The normal values of NE in blood range from 0.45 and 2.49 nM.101 A MIP-based sensor for NE was constructed by electro- polymerizing o-aminophenol on the surface of a GCE in the presence of NE.133Using SWV, a linear increase in the peak current was observed in the range from 50 nM to 10 M, with a LOD of 490 pM. An enzymatic amperometric sensor for NE was fabricated using a of a mesoporous carbon electrode.134The sensor permitted the linear determination of NE level up to 2995 M, with a LOD of 591 M. The use of electrode materials coated with poly(acrylic acid) represents a means to enhance the selectivity of the underlying sensors, because the negatively charged lm can inhibit anionic interferents, such as ascorbic acid and uric acid. A sensingplatform for NE was designed utilizing a screen-printed carbon electrode modi ed with poly(acrylic acid) coated-MWCNTs.135 DPV permitted linear quanti cation of the NE level up to 10 M, with a LOD of 131 nM. 3.1.6. Nitric Oxide (NO). NO is a transcellular messenger molecule that mediates various physiological and pathological events in the biological system. NO is released by most cancer cells and normal cells under drug stimulation and in the course ofdisease development. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to detect NO in real-time due to its low concentration, high diusivity, and fast decay. 136 An enzymatic electrochemical assay for NO was developed using a microperoxidase enzyme immobilized onto a nano- composite of MWCNTs and poly-5,2 :5,2-terthiophene-3 - carboxylic acid on the of GCE.137Catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes were coimmobilized onto theprobe surface to prevent any interference from H 2O2and O2 during NO detection. Using amperometry, a linear relationshipwas established between the current and NO concentration inthe range from 1 to 40 M, with a LOD of 4.3 nM.Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXJAnother enzymatic approach was described for NO detection in biological fluids, which usually contain a mixture of NO and its oxidation products, nitrite and nitrate.138In this method, nitrate was enzymatically converted to nitrite, which thenchemically converted to equimolar NO in acidic iodide bath.The total NO was directly detected using an amperometricsensor. The method permitted a sensitive detection of NO, witha LOD of 0.1 nM. Hemin is an iron protoporphyrin that has a high binding anity and selectivity toward NO. A NO sensor was fabricated using a hemin-functionalized graphene-based FET. 139An ecient immobilization of hemin molecules without damaging the graphene lattice, was attained throughstacking interactions. The sensor allowed for the linear determination of NO level up to 1 M, with a LOD of 0.3 nM. Direct oxidation of NO using nanomaterials-based sensors has also been reported.140A nanocomposite of GNPs was deposited on a three-dimensional graphene hydrogel to fabricate anamperometric sensor for NO. The relation between theoxidation peak current and NO level was linear over the rangefrom 0.2 to 6 M, with a LOD of 9 nM. Direct real-time monitoring of NO was demonstrated using a thin amperometric sensor that can be embedded into a microfluidic device. 141A gold/indium tin oxide (Au/ITO) patterned electrode was directly positioned on a porous polymermembrane as the base working electrode. An electrochemicallydeposited Au-hexacyanoferrate layer on the surface of Au/ITOwas used to catalyze NO oxidation to nitrite at lower potential. Inaddition, a gas-permeable membrane was used to enhance theselectivity of the sensor. The sensor enabled NO detection, witha LOD of 1 nM. 3.1.7. Glutamate (Glu). Glu is a major excitatory neuro- transmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in the main aspects of brain functions and plays a principal role inneural activation. Excessive glutamate in brain fluids is indicative of acute brain insults such as traumatic brain injury and stroke. 142 An enzymatic amperometric sensor for Glu was constructed using glutamate oxidase immobilized onto a composite chitosan, preformed on thesurface of a gold electrode.143A linear relationship was obtained between the amperometric current and Glu concentration overthe range of 5 500M, with a LOD of 1.6 M. Another enzymatic sensor was based on glutamate dehydro- genase enzyme covalently attached to the tips of vertically alignedCNTs grown on the surface of a silicon substrate using directcurrent plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. 144Using DPV, two linear calibration curves of Glu were obtained in therange from 0.1 to 20 M and 20 to 300 M, with a LOD of 57 nM. An enzyme-free electrochemical platform for Glu analysis was developed using vertically aligned arrays of nickel nanowires andplatinum-coated nickel nanowires. 145The amperometric sensor allowed for the analysis of glutamate level up to 8 mM, with aLOD of 68 and 83 M for nickel nanowire array and platinum- coated nickel nanowire array, respectively. 3.1.8. Tryptamine. This monoamine alkaloid found in trace amounts in the brains of mammals is believed to play a role as aneurotransmitter or neuromodulator. Tryptamine acts as anonselective serotonergic receptor agonist releasing agentfor 5-HT and DA. 146 A MIP speci c for tryptamine was synthesized by electro- polymerizing p-aminobenzoic acid in the presence of the template, tryptamine.147The MIP was deposited onto agraphene electrode the quanti cation of tryptamine in the linear range from 90 nM to 70 M, with a LOD of 74 nM. 3.2. Metabolites Metabolites are the intermediates and products of metabolism. They include glucose, uric acid, urea, cholesterol, lactates,hydrogen peroxide, creatine, creatinine, ketone bodies, xanthine,and hypoxanthine. One member of this molecular class, glucose, is perhaps the largest success story in the application of electrochemical sensing methods to clinical applications. Thewidespread use of electrochemical glucometers is a clear exampleof how the cost-e ectiveness and robustness of electrochemical sensors can be leveraged in commercial products. 3.2.1. Glucose. Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide public health problem. This metabolic disorder is caused by insulin deciency and is re flected by blood glucose concentrations higher or lower than the normal range (4.4 6.6 mM). 148The rst and second generations of commercial glucose sensors were based on the immobilization of glucose oxidase enzyme onto anelectrode surface. Mediators were employed for electron shuttling between the enzyme and electrode surface.149Direct electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode surfacewas introduced in third generation glucose sensors.150The selectivity of these sensors is excellent; however, problems suchas enzyme denaturation and subsequent reduction in reprodu- cibility after storage can arise.151Alternative nonenzymatic glucose sensors are therefore of considerable interest; however,these require alkaline aqueous conditions during measurement,and this is not suitable for in vivo glucose sensing applications. To facilitate glucose monitoring without the need for blood sampling, an enzymatic amperometric sensor was designed to facilitate glucose measurement in tears. 152The sensor relied on immobilized glucose oxidase onto the surface of a 0.25 mmplatinum/iridium wire and anodic detection of the liberatedH 2O2from the enzymatic reaction. Inner layers of Na on and an electropolymerized lm of 1,3-diaminobenzene/resorcinol greatly enhanced the selectivity of the sensor in the presence of interferents in tear fluids. Using only 4 5L of tear fluid, the sensor had a LOD of 1.5 M glucose. A micro fluidic paper-based electrochemical device ( PED) was developed to quantify the glucose level in various biologicalfluids such as serum, blood, and urine. The PED comprised paper-based micro fluidic channels patterned using photo- lithography or wax-printing and electrodes directly screen- printed from conducting inks (e.g., carbon or Ag/AgCl).153A solution of glucose oxidase was spotted on top of the papermicrochannel. Using chronoamperometry (CA), a linearquanti cation of glucose level up to 22.2 mM was accomplished. Another version of the paper-based electrochemical system was made to facilitate flow-injection analysis of glucose. 154In this design, capillary wicking was used to allow for a gravity-drivenflow of bu er solution continuously through paper from a bu er reservoir placed at the higher end of the device to a sink at thelower end. Glucose oxidase was immobilized onto a nitro-cellulose membrane coating a thin platinum electrode positioned on a solid support. The counter and reference electrodes were positioned upstream in the bu er reservoir. CA allowed glucose level determination up to 26 mM, with a LOD of 0.2 mM. Thismethod did not require disposable test strips. A universal mobile electrochemical detector (uMED) was developed for use in resource-limited applications. 155The deviceChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXKwas designed to operate with a wide range of electrode formats coupled directly to the mobile Internet using a cellular device, asshown in Figure 4 . The uMED allowed for direct glucose sensing in blood, using glucose oxidase-modi ed test strips. CA was employed for glucose measurement within the linear range from2.8 to 27.8 mM. An enzymatic-ink-based roller pen was produced to allow for direct incorporation of the sensing element into renewableglucose sensor strips. 156The resulting enzymatic-ink-pen permitted facile fabrication of high-quality inexpensive ampero-metric sensors of any design using a wide variety of surfaces. Therenewable sensor strips allowed for up to 20 measurements of 2mM glucose in blood without any appreciable change insensitivity. Intense research e orts to develop a nity sensors for glucose have focused on the plant lectin Concanavalin A (Con A) due toits inherent stability and activity in physiological pH. 157For example, a competitive capacitive glucose sensor was fabricatedusing Con A-coated GNPs assembled on a polytyramine-modied gold electrode. 158Experimental results demonstrated that the biosensor responded linearly to glucose concentrationsin the range from 1 M to 10 mM under optimized conditions. Another nonenzymatic glucose sensor was based on localized modulation of pH within a symmetric gold gold junction electrode.159In this work, a paired gold gold junction electrode (average gap size ca. 500 nm) was formed by simultaneouselectrodeposition of gold onto two closely spaced platinum diskelectrodes. The potential of the working electrode was set to1.5 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) to increase the pH locally. CV and SWV data demonstrated the linearity of thesensor response within the clinically relevant glucose range of 1 10 mM. 3.2.2. Lactose. Lactose is a disaccharide hydrolyzed by the lactase enzyme in the digestive system into the monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. The lactose level in blood can be used inthe diagnosis of gastrointestinal malignancies. 160 An enzymatic-based amperometric sensor for lactose was prepared by immobilizing -galactosidase enzyme in a layer-by- layer onto a Prussian blue-coated ITOelectrode.161The sensor responded linearly to increasing lactose concentrations and had a LOD of 1.1 mM. Another lactose-speci c enzyme, cellobiose dehydrogenase, was utilized to construct an amperometric sensor for lactose.162 Here, the enzyme was immobilized acid- co-aniline) MWCNTs fol- lowed by the nanohybrid on the surface of agold electrode. The sensor responded linearly to lactoseconcentrations up to 30 mM. 3.2.3. Uric Acid (UA). UA is the major nitrogenous molecule in urine and has been associated with a variety of clinical disorders. Elevated UA level in blood, also called hyperuricemia or Lesch Nyhan syndrome, may result in gout and other pathological conditions, including obesity, diabetes, high bloodpressure, and kidney and heart diseases. The normal values of UAin blood range between 200 and 400 M. 163One of the major problems inherent in direct biological determination of UAresults from the interference caused by other biomolecules ofclose oxidation potential such as ascorbic acid. 164 An enzymatic amperometric sensor for UA was fabricated using ferrocene-induced electroactivated enzyme depos-ited within a Na of uricase was achieved using CV through the electrostaticinteraction between the Fc molecules and tryptophan residueswithin the hydrophobic pockets in the enzyme. The sensorsystem generated a linear response over a range from 500 nM to600M UA, with a LOD of 230 nM. A nonenzymatic assay for UA in urine was developed using boron-doped diamond microelectrodes. 166The approach relied on the superior properties of BDD, such as low backgroundcurrent, low nonspeci c adsorption of other species, long-term stability, and antifouling capabilities upon electrochemicalreactivation. Direct estimation of UA concentrations down to 1mM was feasible in the presence of ascorbic acid. In a related system, a sulfur-adlayer-coated gold electrode was utilized for UA analysis. The sensor facilitated UA oxidation at a signicantly lower overpotential with a higher current density as compared to an unmodi ed electrode. 167The proposed electrochemical sensor showed a linear amperometric responseto UA in the concentration range from 2.5 M to 5 mM, with a LOD of 0.4 M. A dendrimer-modi ed sensor was used for selective determination of UA in the presence of ascorbic acid.168In this work, a GCE was groups. The concen-tration of UA was determined using CV, with a LOD of 34.5 nM. 3.2.4. Urea. Because urea is the nal product of protein metabolism, its level often provides critical information on thenutritional status of the human body. The normal concentrationrange of urea is 2.5 6.6 mM, depending on the patient 's age and sex. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and urine urea nitrogen (UUN) tests are often used to assess kidney disorders such as acute kidney failure or end-stage renal diseases. However,alteration of the urea level is not highly speci c for kidney diseases, but instead may re flect dehydration or increased protein intake. 169 Using a pH-switchable electrochemical sensing platform, both urea and glucose can be analyzed.170The detection relies on in situ pH-switchable enzyme-catalyzed reactions in which thehydroxylation of urea catalyzed by urease or oxidation of glucose catalyzed by glucose oxidase resulted in a pH change in the electrolyte solution, leading to a di erent electrochemical Figure 4.

Using CV, DPV, and EIS, urea analysis was achieved in the linear range from 1 to 7 mM. In another enzymatic approach, an amperometric sensor for urea was constructed using a multilayered graphene-coated ITOelectrode. 171Notably, multilayered graphene was used because of its large 2D surface area and high electrical conductivity. Urease and glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes were coimmobi-lized onto the sensor surface. The assay permitted theinterrogation of urea level in the linear range from 1.7 to 16.7 mM, with a LOD of 0.6 mM. A urease-based potentiometric sensor for urea was also reported. 172The enzyme was either physisorbed onto an electrodeposited polyaniline lm immobilized on a layer-by- layer lm alternating carboxymethylpullulan and chitosan assembled on the polyaniline lm. The potentiometric response was proportional to urea concentration in the range from 1 Mt o 100 mM. The sensor based on the enzyme-grafted layer-by-layerlm has exhibited higher stability, a nding attributed to the protective nature of the polysaccharide coating. A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for urea was developed using a gold electrode coated with cadmium sul de quantum dots (QDs) doped chitosan as the functional matrix. 173Using DPV, two linear ranges for urea analysis were demonstrated between 5 pM and 0.4 nM and between 0.5 and 70 nM, with aLOD of 1 pM. 3.2.5. Cholesterol. Monitoring cholesterol is of great importance, especially for people with a high risk of developing heart diseases. Determination of blood cholesterol is required forthe diagnosis of atherosclerosis and for estimation of the risk of thrombosis and cardiovascular disorders. The normal concen- tration of total cholesterol in blood should be less than 5.17 mM,but the value can vary from person to person depending on age, weight, and gender. The threshold level for total cholesterol concentration in human blood to be classi ed as high is de ned as 5.17 6.18 mM. 174 A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for cholesterol was fabricated by mixing MIP-coated MWCNTs, graphite powder,and silicon alkoxide, followed by packing the formed mixture intothe electrode cavity of a Te flon sleeve. 175Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) allowed for the quanti cation of cholesterol in the linear range of 10 300 nM, with a LOD of 1 nM. An enzymatic amperometric sensor for cholesterol was constructed using a composite magnetic ferrite nanoparticles (GA-MNPs) and carboxylated MWCNTs with the positively charged PDDA priorto the addition of GA-MNPs. Cholesterol oxidase and HRP enzymes were coimmobilized onto the composite cast and deposited on a GCE. The sensor allowed for the calibration ofcholesterol level in the linear range from 0.01 to 0.95 mM, with a LOD of 0.85 M. A reagentless self-powered cholesterol sensing platform was prepared using the same substrate to power both the anodic andcathodic electrocatalytic reactions. 177Cholesterol oxidase was immobilized in a sol gel matrix, coating both the cathode and the anode. Cholesterol oxidation catalyzed by cholesterol oxidaseoccurred at the anode, whereas hydrogen peroxide, a product of the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol, was electrocatalytically reduced by Prussian blue at the cathode ( Figure 5 ). The resulting self-powered amperometric sensor enabled the analysis of cholesterol concentrations up to 4.1 mM.In another enzymatic approach, an amperometric triglyceride sensor was fabricated using a mixture of four enzymes, includinglipase, glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, and HRPcoimmobilized platinum electrode coatedwith a poly(vinyl alcohol) membrane. 178The current response was proportional to triglyceride concentration in the range from560M to 2.3 mM, with a LOD of 210 M. An interesting approach for cholesterol analysis combined a simple electrochemical microp aper-based analytical device (EPADs) and a commercially available glucometer.73Each EPAD contained printed wax barriers to de ne the sample and reference zones, whereas the test strips were made from plastic ora single layer of paper. In the enzyme-catalyzed step, cholesteroloxidase catalyzed the oxidation of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one, of Fe(III) to Fe(II), and theFe(II) (CN) 64ions generated were subsequently detected electrochemically. Amperometric analysis of cholesterol inhuman plasma yielded a linear calibration plot in theconcentration range from 0.5 5.2 mM, with a LOD of 340 M. A nonenzymatic voltammetric sensing platform for cholesterol has also been reported. 179In this work, a hydrophilic and electroactive cholesterol sensing interface was formed bymodifying a chemically converted graphene with -cyclodextrin and methylene blue. In the presence of cholesterol, themethylene blue molecules were displaced from the inclusioncomplex and moved into the bu er solution and subsequently detected electrochemically. Using DPV, a cholesterol calibrationcurve was obtained in the range of 5 100M, with a LOD of 1 M. 3.2.6. Lactate. The level of lactate in blood is used in the clinical diagnosis of respiratory insu ciency, shock, and acute cardiac disorders. In addition, lactic acidosis is known toaccompany tissue hypoxia, left ventricular failure, and drugtoxicity. The normal values of lactate in blood range between 0.5and 2.2 mM. 180 An the surface of a platinumelectrode.181Typical interference caused by anionic species was minimized by coating the electrode with a Na on membrane. A linear dependence of the catalytic current on lactate concen-tration was demonstrated in the range from 2 and 1000 M, with a LOD of 0.8 M. Another enzymatic approach was based on lactate dehydro- genase enzyme and NAD +coimmobilized onto the surface GCE precoated with a nanocomposite of Fe 3O4magnetic nanoparticles and MWCNTs.182DPV analysis of lactate yielded a linear response over the concentration range of 50 500M, with a LOD of 5 M.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXMAn interesting approach was developed for real-time non- invasive lactate sensing in sweat during exercise events using a printed amperometric sensor \"tattoo \"that conforms to the wearer 's sensor exhibited chemical selectivity toward lactate with linearity up to 20 mM and demonstrated resiliency against the mechanical deformation expected from epidermal wear. The device wastested on human subjects, and it was observed that the lactate proles successfully re flected the production of lactates in sweat at varying exercise intensities. The use of whole cells as a sensing element for lactate analysis was demonstrated using mixed bacterial cultures of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus and palygorskite, a stabilizing matrix for bacteria, coimmobilized onto the surface ofan O 2electrode.184The amperometric response of the sensor was found linear in the concentration range from 0 to 300 M. A FET-based sensor for lactate analysis was developed on the basis of two elements: (i) a pH-sensitive chemical eld-eect transistor and (ii) a metallic microelectrode deposited around a sensitive gate.185The coexistence of these two elements combined potentiometric and amperometric e ects at the microscale. This sensor permitted the quanti cation of lactate in the linear range from 1 to 6 mM. 3.2.7. Hydrogen Peroxide (HP). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important intracellular signaling molecules, mainly regulating DNA damage and cell apoptosis. However, accumu- lation of ROS in cells leads to oxidative stress that may be linkedwith a variety of pathological conditions such as neuro- degenerative disorders, Alzheimer 's disease, autoimmune dis- eases, and cancer. HP is the most common type of ROS studiedin the cell as it induces numerous deleterious biological modications. Hence, selective detection of HP in cells and assessment of its dynamic release process is essential to fullyunderstand the roles of the reactive species in cellular physiology. 186 An enzymatic voltammetric biosensor for HP was engineered by embedding a HRP enzyme in a cross-linked 3D polymermatrix bearing a mobile osmium redox (Os +/+2) and permitting the di usion of the substrate.187Electrons, which reduced the analyte, were transferred from the electrode surface to theenzyme by step-by-step collisions of the redox mediators. CV measurements of HP demonstrated a linear dynamic range extending from 1 to 100 M. In addition, CA measurements of HP exhibited a linear response in the range from 1 to 10 nM, with a LOD of 1 nM. In a closely related approach, mesoporous carbon nano- particles (pore dimension 6.3 nm) were utilized to fabricate electrically contacted enzyme electrodes for HP sensing. 188The pores of the carbon nanoparticles were lled with methylene blue and capped with HRP, and then immobilized onto the surface ofa GCE. Using CV, this sensor permitted the determination of HP levels up to 25 mM. Another enzymatic amperometric sensor for HP was engineered using a microperoxidase-11 enzyme immobilizedonto MWCNTs-functionalized bacterial cellulose. 189Modica- tion of bacterial cellulose with MWCNTs was carried out to provide a flexible conductive lm with high biocompatibility. The proposed sensor allowed for the interrogation of HP levels over the linear range of 0.1 257.6 M, with a LOD of 0.1 M. An enzymatic amperometric sensor was fabricated using a catalase enzyme immobilized onto a lm of L-lysine and MWCNTs-modi ed GCE.190This sensor exhibited a linearcurrent response to HP in the concentration range from 1 Mt o 3.6 mM, with a LOD of 8 nM. Metalloproteins are frequently utilized as a sensing element for HP due to the inherent enzymatic activity of the metal center inthe enzyme molecule. For instance, a protein microarray was prepared on hydrophilic micropatterns of L-cysteine-modi ed Au-TiO followed by immobilization of the metalloprotein, Cytochrome c.191Using amperometry, a broad linear range of HP from 1 nM to 10 mM was quanti ed, with a LOD of 2 nM. Recently, an amperometric sensor for HP was developed bydirect wiring of the heme center of Cytochrome c to a gold ultra microelectrode surface via the use of an imidazole-terminated self-assembled monolayer. 192This sensor allowed for the determination of HP level, with a LOD of 3 M. Using another metalloprotein, hemoglobin, an amperometric HP sensor was engineered by the electrospinning of hemoglobinmicrobelts onto a GCE surface. 193Subsequently, hemoglobin catalyzed the reduction of HP within the dynamic range extending from 10 to 230 M, with a LOD of 0.6 M. Another metalloprotein-based HP sensing platform relied on myoglobin immobilized onto an ITO substrate coated with a lm of nanostructured porous cerium dioxide.194This sensor was capable of detecting HP with linearity up to 3 mM and a LOD of 0.6M. Also, an amperometric sensor for HP was constructed using a heme peptide immobilized onto a conductive 3D hybrid lm of grown on a graphene surface.195The microvoids in the lm contributed to the di usion of HP to the modi ed heme peptide, resulting in an enhanced catalytic cathodic current. The cathodic current increased linearly with HP concentration over the range of 1 30M. Another amperometric sensing platform for HP was prepared using a zinc porphyrin-fullerene (C60) derivative, entrapped in tetraoctylammonium bromide lm and deposited onto the surface of a GCE.196The electrocatalytic reduction of HP showed a broad dynamic range extending from 35 M to 3.4 mM and a LOD of 810 nM. The electrocatalytic activity of nanomaterials has also been exploited to develop a sensing platform for HP. Here, core/shell Au/MnO nanoparticles were prepared by hydride reduction ofmanganese acetylacetonate in the presence of GNPs, and further utilized to construct an amperometric sensor for HP.197This sensor permitted the electrocatalytic reduction of HP in thelinear range from 20 nM to 15.1 mM, with a LOD of 8 nM. In a closely related approach, an electrochemical sensing platform for HP was engineered using nitrogen-doped carbonnanotubes (NCNTs). 198In contrast to MWCNTs, NCNTs possess a activity toward O 2reduction using an e cient four-electron transfer process, whereas a two- electron transfer process is involved in MWCNTs-mediated electrocatalysis. This amperometric sensor allowed for the interrogation of HP level in the linear range from 1.8 to 139M, with a LOD of 370 nM. Another nanomaterial-based assay for HP relied on a 3D graphene network (3DGN) that was preformed using chemicalvapor deposition. 199The 3DGN was used as a template to synthesize various composites, including Pt nanoparticles/ 3DGN, MWCNTs/3DGN, Pt/MWCNTs/3DGN, andMnO 2/3DGN. Experimental results revealed that among the four synthesized composites, the Pt/MWCNTs/3DGN-based amperometric sensor permitted highly sensitive analysis of HP inthe linear range from 25 nM to 6.3 M, with a LOD of 8.6 nM.Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXN3.2.8. Creatine. Creatine is an amino acid derivative synthesized from L-arginine, glycine, and S-adenosylmethionine in the kidneys, liver, and pancreas. Most of the stored creatine isconverted to phosphocreatine in muscle tissues in a Phosphocreatine a majorenergy storage form in the body. The creatine level in blood andurine is clinically used as an indicator of muscle damage. 200 An enzymatic amperometric sensor for creatine was fabricated using a mixture of creatinase and sarcosine oxidase coimmobi-lized onto the surface of a carbon paste electrode modi ed with Fe 3O4nanoparticles.201This sensor exhibited two linear dynamic ranges extending from 0.2 to 3.8 M and from 9 to 1200 M, with a LOD of 0.2 M. 3.2.9. Creatinine. Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism and represents an important indicator of renalfunctions. Creatinine is produced via a biological pathwayinvolving creatine, phosphocreatine, and ATP. The normalvalues of creatinine in blood range between 53 and 115 M. An enzymatic amperometric sensor for creatinine was prepared using a mixture of three enzymes, including creatinineaminohydrolase, creatine aminohydrolase, and on thesurface of a platinum electrode. 202The sensor possessed a working range extending from 10 to 650 M, with a LOD of 0.5 M. A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for creatinine has also been reported.203In this work, the template molecule, creatinine, was self-assembled onto the surface of Fe3O4polyaniline nano- particles in the presence of the functional monomer, aniline.After magnetically guided preassembly via a magnetic GCE, theordered structure of the MIP was established by electro-polymerization onto the electrode surface. The DPV responseshowed a linear correlation with creatinine concentration in therange from 20 nm to 1 M, with a LOD of 350 pM. A competitive MIP-based amperometric sensor for creatinine was also constructed by coating an array of gold electrodes withcreatinine embedded in pyrrole via electropolymerization. 204 The creatinine sample was subsequently mixed with a HRP-labeled anticreatinine antibody, and the mixture was transferredonto the electrode surface to allow for a competitive reactionwith the creatinine embedded in the electrode surface.Amperometric measurements were carried out in the presenceof 3,3 ,5,5-tertamethylbenzidine (TMB) and H 2O2. By applying a circular square wave, the creatinine level was measured up to 1mM. An enzymeless electrochemical method for creatinine relied on the measurement of consumed picrate anions upon reactionwith creatinine molecules, using an edge graphiteelectrode. 205Amperometric analysis of the consumed picrate anions permitted the determination of creatinine level over twolinear dynamic ranges of 0 6 and 6 11 mM, with a LOD of 720 M. 3.2.10. Ketone Bodies. Ketone bodies including acetone, 3- hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate are biomarkers for diabetesthat has progressed to severe ketoacidosis. An enzymatic voltammetric sensor for 3-hydroxybutyrate was prepared using enzymeimmobilized onto the surface of SWCNTs-coated screen-printedelectrode. 206CV was used for 3-hydroxybutyrate analysis on the basis of the signal produced by 3-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), one of the products of the enzymaticreaction. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the response was linear with increasing 3-hydroxybutyrate concen-trations in the range from 0.1 to 2 mM, with a LOD of 9 M. A nonenzymatic voltammetric sensor for acetone was fabricated using a ZnO nanoparticles-coated GCE.207It was observed that the current increased linearly with increasing acetone concentration in the range from 130 M to 1330 mM, with a LOD of 68 M. 3.2.11. Xanthine. Xanthine is an intermediate of the purine nucleotide deoxynucleotide metabolism. As the metabolicprecursor of uric acid, xanthine is the rst indicator of an abnormal purine pro le and thus can serve as a marker for many diseases, including hyperuricemia, gout, xanthinuria, and cerebral ischemia.208The normal values of xanthine in urine range between 40 and 160 M.209 An enzymatic amperometric sensor for xanthine was reported elsewhere.210In this work, a GCE was modi ed with SWCNTs and a 3D network of electropolymerized GNPs capped with 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, p-aminothiphenol, and lization of xanthine oxidase and -cyclodextrin through host guest interactions. This sensor allowed for the measurement ofxanthine in the linear range from 50 nM to 9.5 M, with a LOD of 40 nM. A nonenzymatic xanthine sensor was engineered using a reduced graphene oxide-modi ed GCE that was coated with an electropolymerized lm of poly( o-aminophenol- co-pyrogallol) (PAP). 211PAP was synthesized the electrochemical copolymerization of o-aminophenol and pyrogallol in acidic solution. Notably, reduced graphene oxide played a signi cant role in increasing the amount of electropolymerized PAP ascompared to that formed on the bare GCE due to the largesurface area of reduced graphene oxide. Amperometric analysis of xanthine showed a linear dynamic range from 1 to 120 M, with a LOD of 0.5 M. 3.2.12. Hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is the precursor of xanthine, and its normal values in blood range between 10 and 30M. 212Hypoxanthine plays a role in posthypoxic reoxygenation cell injury through oxygen radical production and serves as anindicator of hypoxia.213 A low-potential enzymatic amperometric of hypoxanthine to uric acid via an oxidativehydroxylation mechanism. The electrocatalytic oxidation response showed a linear dependence on the total concentrationof xanthine and hypoxanthine ranging from 10 M to 1.8 mM, with a LOD of 0.25 nM. 3.3. Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds and vital nutrients required by living organisms in limited amounts to perform diverse biologicalfunctions. In the last ve years, several electrochemical sensors have been developed for the analysis of a variety of vitamins such as biotin (vitamin B7 or H), ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C), folic acid (vitamin B9), ribo flavin (vitamin voltammetric immunosensor for biotin was developed using an antibiotin antibody immobilized onto the surface of a boronicacid-modi ed screen-printed gold electrode via the interaction between boronic acid and the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody. 215This approach was adopted to improve theChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXOorientation of the antibody on the surface and subsequently maximize its interaction with biotin. Using SWV, the level of biotin was interrogated over the range from 100 pM to 1 mM. Notably, the normal values of biotin in blood range between 0.9and 3.1 M. 216 An enzymatic amperometric sensor for AA was fabricated using an ascorbate oxidase enzyme immobilized between aninner and outer lm of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and MWCNTs-coated Na on, respectively. 217The relationship between AA concentration and the response current was linear in the range from 400 nM to 1 mM, with a LOD of 87 nM.Notably, the normal values of AA in blood range between 34 and 114M.218 A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for AA was prepared by incorporating AA as a template molecule during the electro- chemical copolymerization of o-phenylenediamine and o-amino- phenol ammoniumaqueous solution. 219Using DPV, quanti cation of AA was attainable in the linear range from 0.1 to 10 mM, with a LOD of 36.4 M. MIP-based sensors have also been used for folic acid analysis.220In this system, a MIP/carbon composite was prepared via in situ free radical polymerization of 2,4,6- trisacrylamido-1,3,5-trizine and subsequent cross-linking withethylene glycol dimethacrylate, in the presence of carbon powder and the template, folic acid. Di erential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry (DPCSV) permitted the quanti cation of folic acid in the linear range from 1.4 to 8.6 nM, with a LOD of 0.5 nM. Normal values of folic acid in blood range between 4.5 and 45.3 nM. 221 In a self-powered nonenzymatic sensing platform for AA, the oxidation of AA was carried out on a nanocarbon-based anode leading to reduction of Prussian blue at the cathode into Prussian white.222The rate of color change from blue to colorless is dependent on AA concentration. Using CA, the current concentration dependency was linear over the range of 10 350 M, with a LOD of 4 M. A nonenzymatic sensor for ribo flavin was engineered using a carbon ionic liquid electrode. DPV measurements of ribo flavin demonstrated two linear dynamic ranges of 0.8 110 and 110 1000 nM, with a LOD of 0.1 nM.223Notably, the normal values of ribo flavin in blood poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) acid and ferricyanide, as doping anions during the electropolymerization of PEDOT onto the surface of a GCE.225This sensing platform was employed for pyridoxine analysis within the linear working range of 1 1500 M, with a LOD of 0.5 M. Importantly, the normal values of pyridoxine in blood range between 30 and 144 nM,226so this sensor will require optimization to measure physiological levels of pyridoxine. A nonenzymatic voltammetric sensor for using 4-ferrocenylmethyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (FMTAD)-modi ed screen-printed gold electrode.227FMTAD is able to bind 25OHD through a DielsAlder reaction between the conjugated diene of the vitamin and triazoline-3,5-dionic group of FMTAD, thus allowing a voltammetric transduction due to the electroactive of ferrocene. Using DPV, linear quanti cation of 25(OH)D was feasible in the range from 49.9 to 495 nM, with a LOD of 24.8 nM. Notably, the level of 25(OH)D re flectsaccurately the level of vitamin D in the body. The normal values of 25(OH)D in blood range between 80 and 248 nM.228 3.4. Amino Acids Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are essentialfor cell function. They play a variety of roles in nutrition and whole-body homeostasis, inclu ding nucleic acid synthesis, metabolic regulation, cell signaling, osmoregulation, acid base balance, and reproduction. Several amino acids are involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as tryptophan and tyrosine, and in the synthesis of serotonin and epinephrine. Also,arginine has a cardioprotective function because it acts as a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide, a vasodilator with a hypotensive e ect. 229 The normal amino acid level in plasma is in the micromolar range and can be as low as 2 11M for aspartic acid and as high as 352 689 M for glutamine. Analysis of amino acids is required for the diagnosis a nd management of inherited metabolic disorders a ecting more or one amino acids, such as tyrosinaemia, cystine-lysinuria, homocystinuria, hyperglycinae- mia, phenylketonuria, and citrullinaemia. An increase in the totallevel of plasma amino acids can be a sign of kidney failure, Reye syndrome, ketoacidosis, and fructose intolerance. A decrease in the total level of plasma amino acids might be caused bymalnutrition, rheumatoid arthritis, nephrotic syndrome, Hun- tington 's disease, and fever. 230In the last ve years, a variety of electrochemical sensors have been developed for the analysis of amino acids such as L-lysine was designed on the basis of the impregnation of L-lysine oxidase in a diamond paste.231This sensor exhibited a linear response toward L-lysine in the range from 1 to 100 nM, with a LOD of 4 pM. Also, severalenzymatic sensors were reported for the detection of leucine 232 and D-methionine.233 A voltammetric aptasensor for phenylalanine was constructed using a c aptamer immobilized onto a gold electrode.234Using DPV, phenylalanine was analyzed in the linear range from 1 to 10 nM, with a LOD of 1 nM. A voltammetric sensor for L-histidine was fabricated using a specicL-histidine-dependent DNAzyme modi ed with a ferrocene tag at the distal end.235In the presence of L-histidine, the DNA probe with a single ribo-adenine was self-cleaved, bringing the ferrocene tag close to the electrode surface, which subsequently enhanced the electron transfer to the electrodesurface. Using SWV, linear interrogation of the L-histidine level was allowed in the range from 0.1 pM to 50 nM, with a LOD of 0.1 pM. A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for L-histidine was developed using a combination of a MIP and MWCNTs. The sensing interface was prepared on an ITO electrode via stepwise modication with MWCNTs and a thin lm of MIP via sol gel technology.236DPV measurements revealed a linear relationship between the current and L-histidine concentration in the range from 2 M to 1 mM, with a LOD of 5.8 nM. In addition, several MIP-based sensors were reported for the detection of arginine,237tyrosine,238phenylalanine,239and tryptophan.240 Cyclotricatechylene, a redox-active tris-catechol analogue, was recently utilized to fabricate a voltammetric sensor for cysteine using a cyclotricatechylene-modi ed carbon electrode.241CV measurements revealed the ability of the sensor to determineChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXPcysteine concentration up to 40 M, with a LOD of 0.6 and 0.9 Mi nb u er solution and tissue extracts, respectively. Many sensors for amino acids can distinguish between the D and Lenantiomers of amino acids. Enantiomeric discrimination can be achieved using (i) stereoselective enzymes such as D- methionine oxidase,233D-leucine oxidase,233and L-lysine oxidase;231(ii) L-tryptophan;240and (iii) stereoselective electrode coating materials such as -cyclodextrin at an optimized temperature for selective detection of L-tryptophan243and dsDNA probes in the presence of Cu(II) for detection of L-tryptophan.244 A variety of electrocatalytic electrode coating materials have been utilized to construct amino biosensors, including cobaltphthalocyanine,245poly addition, the use of nanostructured surfaces provides a means to achieve sensitive analysis of amino acids, including gold nanorods/MWCNTs,258gold nanoclusters,259graphene nano- 3N4nanosheets,270for tyrosine analysis. 3.5. Dietary Minerals Dietary minerals are chemical elements required by livingorganisms other than the four essential elements, including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen present in commonorganic molecules. Dietary minerals have key roles in several biological functions such as energy production, bone mineraliza-tion, nerve and muscle functions, and immunity. Dietaryminerals are classi ed as major minerals (macrominerals) and trace minerals (microminerals). Both macro- and micromineralsare equally important for the body; however, microminerals areneeded in smaller amounts as compared to macrominerals.Examples of macrominerals include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, and chloride. On the other hand, microminerals include iron, zinc, iodine, cupper, manganese,selenium, chromium, molybdenum, and fluoride. In addition, some minerals are required in trace amounts, including cobalt,silicon, nickel, and vanadium. The use of aptamers for the detection of dietary minerals was demonstrated in a nanochannel-based amperometric aptasensorfor potassium. 271A potassium speci c G-quadruplex aptamer assembled onto the inner walls of porous anodicalumina nanochannels via a Schi reaction between the aptamer and nanochannels. Conformational switching of the aptamers within the nanochannels occurred in the presence of potassium molecules, which resulted in increased sterichindrance and subsequently reduction in the anodic current.Quantitative detection of potassium was realized in the linearrange from 5 to 200 M, with a LOD of 0.4 M. Another aptamer-based voltammetric sensor for potassium was developed by combining the binding ability of a potassium-specic aptamer and the RecJ fexonuclease-mediated signal amplication.272A DNA probe, with a stem-loop structure containing the potassium-speci c aptameric sequence, was synthesized with a thiol group at the proximal end and methyleneblue at the distal end. In the presence of potassium ions, the G- rich single-stranded aptamer was transformed to a G-quadruplex via intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, the stempart of the probe was broken, releasing the single stranded 5 end. Because RecJ fis a single-stranded DNA speci c exonuclease, the DNA was digested and the potassium ions were released intosolution and became recognized by another DNA probe on theelectrode surface, thus initiating a new RecJ fcleavage cycle, as shown in Figure 6 . Because of the departure of the methylene blue molecules, a signi cant reduction in the peak current was Figure 6.

SWV measurements permitted the quanti cation of potassium ions in the linear range from 50 nM to 1 mM, with aLOD of 50 nM. A protein-based impedimetric sensor for calcium ions was constructed using porcine protein immobilized onto a polyvinyl butyral-coated gold electrode.273The biosensor exhibited a linear response to calcium ions concentrationsranging from 12.5 to 200 mM. A MIP-based sensor for cadmium and copper ions was fabricated by modifying a PGE with a dual-ion imprintedpolymer in a sol gel matrix. 274Using DPASV, this sensor allowed for the analysis of cadmium and copper ions in the linear ranges from 3.8 to 38.3 nM and 2.3 to 21.5 nM, respectively. The LOD values were 0.4 and 0.5 nM for cadmium and copper ions,respectively. Ion-sensing electrochemical paper-based analytical devices (EPADs) were also utilized for the analysis of several ions such aschloride, potassium, sodium, and calcium. 275An EPAD for sensing chloride ions comprised wax-de ned sample reference zones; each incorporated an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. EPADs developed for electrolytes comprised apolyvinyl chloride ion-selective membrane to separate thesample zone from a paper indicator electrode. The ion-selectiveEPADs exhibited a linear response over 3 orders of magnitudeover the range from 1 mM to 1 M, for chloride and sodium ions,and 0.1 100 mM for potassium and calcium ions. A potentiometric sensor for magnesium was designed on the basis of the magnesium selective ionophore, 4,5-bis- ionophore-containing polymer was borosilicate glasscapillary modi ed with ZnO The concentration-dependent potential di erence versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode within the concentration range from 500 nM to 100 mM. A volatmmetric sensor for calcium ions was engineered using a gold microparticle-modi ed GCE.277This sensor catalyzed the electrochemical reduction of alizarin red after alkaline thelinear quanti of calcium ions over the linear range from 0.6M to 0.1 mM, with a LOD of 0.5 M. Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) was used for zinc analysis. 278The analysis involved a preconcentration step to accumulate the metal ions onto the surface of a copper electrodeby reducing them into ions, followed by a stripping step at apositive potential to reoxidize the metal back to its ionic form.This sensor performed reliably in acetate bu er and allowed for zinc analysis with a LOD of 6 M. 3.6. Other Small Molecules Other biologically relevant small molecules have been detected using electrochemical is an important coenzyme found in all living cells. It exists in two forms, including an oxidized (NAD +) and a reduced form (NADH). It plays a key role in a variety of metabolic redoxreactions as an electron carrier, as well as in cell signaling.279Also, it participates in posttranslational modi cation of proteins. NADH dysfunction is associa ted with many pathological conditions such as reduced respiratory capacity and increasedoxidative stress.280In addition, the rate of NADH turnover in cancer cells is higher than that in normal cells, and thus it can beused as a biochemical marker in the analysis of new cancertherapeutics. Because of its role in the synthesis of tyrosinehydroxylase and endogenous dopamine, NADH levels canprovide information that enables the selection of appropriatedrugs for Parkinson 's disease, Alzheimer 's disease, and major depression diseases. 281 While NADH is a redox-active molecule, the oxidation of NADH at bare metal electrodes exhibits signi cant irreversibility and requires overpotentials up to 1 V. The use of such a highoverpotential with unmodi ed electrodes leads to rapid fouling of the electrode surface and causes problems arising fromnonspeci c oxidation of other species, such as ascorbates and urates. 282 A nonenzymatic amperometric sensor for NADH was fabricated using a platinum modi ed with hierarchi- cally driven iridium oxide nanowires.282Iridium oxide is an exceptionally biocompatible metal oxide with high catalyticactivity, low resistivity, and superior chemical and thermalstability. 283A platinum microwire coated with iridium oxide exhibited remarkably enhanced current signals in response toNADH oxidation as compared to the bare platinum electrodedue to its smaller oxidation overpotential. This enhanced the selectivity of the sensor and reduced its surface fouling. The sensor permitted the determination of NADH level up to 1 mM,with a LOD of 5 M. An assay based on NADH oxidation was developed using a screen-printed carbon electrode modi ed with polythionine. 284 The system allowed for the quanti cation of NADH in the linear range from 20 M to 1 mM, with a LOD of 1.7 M. Another sensing platform for NADH was developed using a FET modi ed with 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate functionalized-SWCNTs.285In the presence of NADH, electrons were transferred to the phenazine derivative throughthe SWCNTs, allowing for a sensitive analysis in the linear rangebetween 10 pM and 500 nM, with a LOD of 1 pM. 3.6.2. Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP). AMP is a purine nucleoside produced during ATP synthesis by the enzymeadenylate kinase. The variation of AMP levels in body fluids may be indicative of some diseases such as liver diseases and cancer.AMP can also exist as a cyclic structure known as cyclic AMP(cAMP). cAMP is an intracellular second messenger thatregulates kinase A (PKA) signal transduction system.Several studies have demonstrated that changes of cAMPconcentration are closely related to pathological conditions.Plasma cAMP concentrations fluctuate in patients with type-2 diabetes and chronic hepatitis. In addition, cAMP levels in urine were found to increase in humoral hypercalcemia malignancy,hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D de ciency. 286 An aptamer-based impedimetric sensor for cAMP has also been reported.287The aptasensor had a wide e ective dynamic range extending from 50 to 250 pM, with a LOD of 50 pM inbuer, and from 50 nM to 1 M, with a LOD of 50 nM in serum. An amperometric sensor for AMP was designed, taking advantage of the electrocatalytic properties of hemin/G-quadruplex HRP-mimicking DNAzyme. 288In this work, a nucleic acid structure consisting of an AMP-speci c aptamer sequence and a G-quadruplex sequence was immobi-lized onto the surface of a gold electrode. In the presence ofAMP, the hairpin structure was opened and the hemin/G-quadruplex HRP-mimicking DNAzyme was generated on theChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXRsurface. This sensor allowed for AMP analysis with a LOD of 1 M. A direct AMP oxidation-based amperometric sensor was constructed using a carbon molecular wire electrode modi ed with a composite of hexa fluorophosphate) and chitosan. 289The oxidation peak current of AMP was proportional to its concentration in the range from 10 nM to 80 M, with a LOD of 3.4 nM. 3.6.3. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). ATP, the major energy currency of the cell, plays a crucial role in the regulation ofcellular metabolism and biochemical pathways. It is also used as an indicator of cell viability and injury. Therefore, the determination of ATP is essential in biochemical studies andclinical research. The normal values of ATP in serum range between 0.1 and 3 mM. 290 An ATP-speci c aptamer291was reengineered and imple- mented into an electrochemical aptasensor for detection of ATP.292Reengineering allowed the aptamer to undergo a signicant conformational change upon target binding and thereby enhanced the e ciency with which terminal redox tags exchange electrons with the electrode surface, leading to improved sensitivity. SWV measurements revealed that thedynamic range of the sensor spanned 5 orders of magnitude, including the physiological range (0.1 3 mM), and the sensor did not appear to become saturated at the highest ATPconcentration tested (250 mM). Another aptamer-based approach toward the detection of ATP was developed using a dual-signaling ampli cation strategy. 293 The sensor featured both signal-ON and -OFF sensing pathways. The sensor design comprised a ferrocene-labeled aptamer a methylene blue-tagged DNA probe thiolated atthe proximal end. The interaction between ATP and the aptamer led to dissociation of the duplex DNA structure and released the ferrocene-tagged aptamer from the sensing interface. In addition,the methylene blue-labeled DNA formed a hairpin structure through the hybridization of the complementary sequences atboth ends. These conformational changes resulted in decreased peak currents for ferrocene (signal-OFF) and increased methylene blue currents (signal-ON). The changes of the dualsignals were linear with ATP concentration in the range from 10nM to 100 M, with a LOD of 1.9 nM. A displacement-based electrochemical aptasensor for ATP detection was developed utilizing a recognition surface based onan ATP-speci c aptamer prebound to electroactive flavin adenine dinucleotide onto the surface of a carbon-paste electrode modi ed with graphene and GNPs. 294Binding of ATP to the aptamer caused a release of an equivalent concentration of FAD molecules that were quantitatively monitored in real-time at the sensing interface. Using adsorptive stripping SWV, a wide linear working range ofATP was obtained from 0.1 nM to 30 M, with a LOD of 20.1 pM. Another aptamer-based sensing platform for ATP was adopted to enhance the detection sensitivity via a current recti cation strategy. Here, a ferrocene-tagged ATP-speci c aptamer was assembled onto a gold electrode surface. 295Without signal amplication, the resulting current response was relatively small and limited by the amount of probe molecules on surface. Asolution-phase redox probe, hexachloroiridate, was used toreplenish continuously the ferrocene tag with charge carriers. Unidirectional electron transfer from the electrode via the ferrocene group to the solution-phase charge carrier ampli ed the cathodic current response. In the reverse direction, theelectron transfer process was thermodynamically unfavorablebecause the electrons could not be transferred from the hexachloroiridate to ferrocene molecules. Alternating current voltammetry (ACV) permitted the determination of ATP levelup to 5 M, with a LOD of 114 nM. An aptamer-based potentiometric sensor for ATP was fabricated using an ATP-speci c aptamer electrostatically bound to a protamine binding domain. 296Binding of the aptamer to ATP caused a conformational change in the aptamer, and the released protamine was monitored by a conventional Figure 7.

Potentiometric titra- tion of ATP exhibited a linear dynamic range extending from 0.5to 4M, with a LOD of 0.3 M. An ultrasensitive universal approach applicable to a variety of clinically relevant biomolecules, including ATP, was recentlydescribed. 297In this system, a probe molecule was tethered to the electrode surface and bound to a neutralizer, which is a conjugate of PNA that contains cationic amino acids at the proximal anddistal termini to neutralize the negative charge of a DNA probe. The probe-neutralizer was designed to contain mismatches such that the analyte of interest could bind more strongly to the probeand displace the neutralizer. When an ATP-speci c aptamer was used as the probe molecule, ATP successfully displaced the neutralizer from the aptamer-neutralizer hybrid and caused asignicant increase in the current. DPV measurements performed in the presence of an electrocatalytic redox pair, [Ru(NH 3)6]3+/[Fe(CN) 6]3, revealed the ability of the sensor to detect low concentrations of ATP down to 1 M, as shown in Figure 7 . Another aptamer-mediated ATP assay relied on signal III (Exo III)-assisted target recycling.298Here, a hairpin-aptamer probe was designed, which consisted of an aptamer sequence for ATP that is cagedin the duplex structure of the stem and a ferrocene tag. In the absence of ATP, the hairpin-aptamer probe could resist the cleavage activity of Exo III, because the 3 -end existed in a single- strand con guration and exhibited a negligible electrochemical response on the sensing electrode, due to its di usion suppression toward a negatively charged ITO electrode. In thepresence of ATP, the hairpin-aptamer probe reverted to the active G-quadruplex structure where the 3 end nucleic acid, carrying the ferrocene tag, formed a duplex with the stem region.As a result, Exo III hydrolytically digested the 3 end strand, resulting in the release of ferrocene-labeled mononucleotide and subsequently the dissociation of ATP. The ferrocene-labeledmononucleotide, cleaved o by Exo III, possessed much higher diusivity toward the negatively charged ITO electrode due to its less negative charge and small size, leading to a distinct increasein the electrochemical signal. Using DPV, the level of ATP was interrogated over the linear range from 1 to 20 nM, with a LOD of 1 nM. A related approach featured a redox-active Au(III)-assisted coreshell iron oxide, and poly( o-phenylenediamine) nano- structure was designed as a sensing platform for ATP. 299An ATP-speci c aptamer was immobilized onto the surface of the nanostructures via the hydrophobic and -stacking interactions with the nucleobases. The aptamers acted as an inert layer andthus hindered electron transfer. In the presence of ATP, theaptamer dissociated from the surface of the nanostuctures and were cleaved by DNase I. The released ATP then recomplexedother aptamers on the surface and triggered another round of target recycling. SWV measurements permitted the quanti ca- tion of ATP in the range from 0.5 pM to 5 nM, with a LOD of 50fM. Another aptamer-based impedimetric sensor for ATP was fabricated using an array of pyramidal gold nanotips. 300This sensor allowed for a highly sensitive analysis of ATP within thelinear range from 1 pM to 2 M, with a LOD of 1 pM. A ligase-based sensing strategy for ATP was developed using a molecular beacon-like DNA.301In this approach, a biotin-tagged molecular beacon-like DNA was self-assembled onto a goldelectrode to form a stem-loop structure, which blocked electron transfer. In the presence of ATP, two nucleotide fragments complementary to the loop of the capture probe became ligatedby the ATP-dependent T4 DNA ligase. Hybridization of the ligated DNA with the capture probe induced a conformational change in the surface-con ned DNA structure, which sub- sequently released the biotin from the surface and allowed for free exchange of electrons with the electrode surface (signal- ON), as shown in Figure 8 . Using DPV, ATP analysis was achieved in the linear range from 0.1 nM to 1 M, with a LOD of 50 cells, exists in two forms: one is a reduced form (GSH), and the other is an oxidized form (GSSG). In healthy cells, more than 90% of glutathione is found as GSH. However, certain pathologicalconditions causing oxidative stress result in the conversion ofGSH to GSSG. High levels of GSSG are associated with asthma, chronic renal failure, diabetes, Alzheimer 's disease, Parkinson 's disease, and macular degeneration. 302,303The analysis of the GSSG concentration in the body is therefore critical because it provides a sensitive index of the whole body oxidative stress, as well as being useful in the diagnosis of certain clinical disorders.The normal values of GSH and GSSG in blood are 3.8 5.5 and 0.20.5M, respectively.304 An amperometric sensor for GSSG the surface of a GCE.305A linear calibration plot was obtained using CA in the dynamic rangebetween 0.1 M and 2.5 mM, with a LOD of 12.5 nM. The coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, Ubiquinone) was used as a sensing element to construct a voltammetric sensor for GSH based on a GCE modi ed with a mixture of an ionic liquid (1- butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexa fluorophosphate) and Figure 8. Schematic illustration of a hairpin-mediated ATP detection approach. The designed molecular beacon (MB)-like DNA, a 5 -SH, and 3 -biotin were immobilized onto a gold electrode surface in a stem-loop structure via gold sulfur a nity. The oligo A and oligo B, which are complementary to the loop of MB-like DNA, were hybridized to form a ligatable nick, while no ligation occurred in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP, T4 DNAligase was activated, and the two nucleotide fragments were ligated to open the MB-like DNA completely, which subsequently pushed the biotin away from the electrode surface and induced the change of the DNA from a stem-loop to an extended structure. The ferricyanide ions were allowed to easily access the surface, providing a detectable electrochemical signal. Reprinted with permission from ref 301.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXTMWCNTs.306Using DPV, the interrogation of GSH level was permissible in the linear range from 4 to 200 nM, with a LOD of0.3 nM. A DNA-based voltammetric sensor for GSH was designed on the basis of the ability of GSH to chelate Hg(II) and displace itfrom the thymine-Hg(II)-thymine complex formed betweenmethylene blue tagged DNA probes immobilized onto a goldelectrode surface. 307In the presence of GSH, a complex between GSH and Hg(II) is formed, liberating Hg(II) from its complexwith thymine. The increase in the DNA probe flexibility and methylene blue signal is shown in Figure 9 . Unlike other GSH sensors, the signaling mechanism of this sensor did not require direct oxidation of GSH. ACV measurements permitted thequanti cation of GSH in the linear range from 5 nM to 1.3 M. 3.6.5. Heparin. Heparin is a highly sulfated anionic y used antithrombotic agent during clinical procedures. Heparin isusually stored within the secretory granules of mast cells and released into the vasculature only at sites of tissue injury. It has been suggested that the main purpose of heparin is to guard against invading bacteria and other foreign materials, rather than to facilitate anticoagulation. 308The molecular weight of native heparin ranges from 3 to 30 kDa. The normal values of heparin in serum range between 1.2 and 1.8 mg L1.309 A MIP-based potentiometric sensor for heparin was engineered using an ITO electrode.310In this work, an acrylamide-based MIP was grafted on the electrode surface in the presence of heparin, as a template molecule. It was observed that the electrochemical signal behaved linearly with heparin concentration over the range from 10 to 300 ng L1, with a LOD of 10 ng L1. Also, a polymeric membrane-based potentiometric sensor for heparin has been described.311The membrane contained lipophilic inert salt of tridodecylmethylammonium cation and dinonylnaphthalenesulfonate anion. The sensor provided anelectromotive force in response to heparin concentration in the linear range of 5.6 111.1 gm L 1. 3.6.6. Levodopa ( L-DOPA). L-DOPA is chemical precursor for It is biosynthesized from L-tyrosine in a reaction catalyzed by dopadecarboxylase enzyme. Also, L-DOPA can be administered to treat Parkinson 's disease because it can cross the blood brain barrier and become converted into the active form, DA, which cannot cross the blood brain barrier.312 A voltammetric sensor for L-DOPA was fabricated using a carbon paste electrode modi ed with meso-tetrakis(3-methyl- phenyl) cobalt porphyrin and titanium nanoparticles.313 Using DPV, the oxidation current intensity of L-DOPA was proportional to its concentration in the range from 0.1 to 100 M, with a LOD of 2 nM. 3.7.

Today, the worldwide sales of Figure 9. Design and signaling mechanism of the Hg(II)-mediated GSH sensor.

ELECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF NUCLEIC ACIDS 4.1. Application of Nucleic Acid Analysis in Diagnostic Medicine The analysis of speci c nucleic acids sequences is of central importance in clinical medicine. Pathogens responsible forinfectious disease can be rapidly and speci cally identi ed via their nucleic acids (NAs), and molecular-level information can becollected on cancer and other diseases through sequence-levelanalysis. This is a challenging area, however, as NAs are typically present in clinical samples at low levels ( Figure 1 ) and a very high level of speci city is required to distinguish speci c sequences from related molecules. The presence of pathogen-speci c NAs is routinely used for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases. By looking for molecular-level evidence of a bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogen, the lengthytimelines typically associated with culture-based methods can beavoided. Gene-based analysis usually includes a nucleic acidamplication step. While PCR is the most commonly used method for ampli cation, a number of other ampli cation methods have variety of electro- chemical sensing techniques have been developed that areachieving levels of sensitivity that make ampli cation unneces- sary. The formation and growth of cancerous tumors involves an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in DNA, such aspoint mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, microsatelliteinstability, and promoter hypermethylation. At the molecularlevel, a cancer cell can be distinguished from a healthy cell byabnormalities in structure or expression of certain genes. Whileleukemia and lymphomas are associated with relatively few buthighly speci c genetic abnormalities, solid tumors frequently comprise multiple speci c and nonspeci ca b n o r m a l i t i e s . Molecular alterations that have been used for cancer diagnosiscould occur at the DNA level and include gene replication,rearrangements/translocations, point mutations/deletions, orinsertions. 317The bcr-abl oncogene was the rst abnormality reported to be related to a speci ch u m a n malignancy, the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), whichresults from a reciprocal t(9;22) translocation. This translocationis characterized by the formation of a shortened chromosome, named Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), in which the tyrosine kinase of c-abl is constitutively activated. The BCR-ABL fusion genes that are generated are translated into three oncoproteins,p190, p210, p230, associated with three di erent including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, CML, leukemia, respectively. The relativequanti cation of the BCR-ABL fusion transcripts is used forcancer diagnosis and monitoring relapse , are used for the detection of hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia. In addition,alterations of gene are associated with polycythemia vera, primary myelo brosis, and essential thrombocythemia. cance of ALK,EGFR ,KRAS , and BRAF cancer320andBRAF ,KIT, and NRAS alterations in melanomas.321At the RNA level, alterations occur in transcription and post-transcriptional modi cations.322 Circulating cell-free NAs in plasma have been correlated with the severity of injury in stroke323and trauma patients.324Ten times higher plasma DNA concentration was also observed inmyocardial infarction patients.325Thus, detection of cfNAs in blood could provide a means to perform liquid biopsy, which would be bene cial for many diagnostic applications and would avoid the need for tissue biopsies. The discovery of fetal cfNAs in maternal plasma and serum has opened new venues for parental for parental derived species, such as human placental gonadotropin ( hCG), can be detected in maternal plasma, and their expression is correlated with thecorresponding protein product levels. 338 In addition to cfNAs in plasma and serum, DNA in urine represents another tool for molecular analysis. For example,microsatellite alterations have been detected in the urine ofpatients su ering from renal cancer, 339prostate cancer,340,341 and bladder cancer.342It was shown that the kidney is permeable to cfDNA by detecting male-speci c sequences in the urine of females receiving male blood transfusion or carrying a malefetus.343The potential use of cfDNA in organ transplant monitoring was described in a study in which donor-speci c DNA was detected in the plasma of kidney and liver transplantrecipients.344Increase in urinary cfDNA level was observed during acute rejection and was followed by a rapid return to normal level after administration of antirejection drugs.345The donor genetic material was also detected in circulation after boneallotransplantation.346 Tumor-associated mRNA was rst detected in the plasma or serum of cancer patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma347and melanoma.348In addition, mRNAs of various telomerase components have been detected in plasma or serum of patients with breast cancer,349follicular lymphoma,350and hepatocellular carcinoma.351Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and mammaglobin mRNAs in the plasma of breast cancerpatients,352whereas -catenin mRNA was observed in the plasma of patients with adenoma and colorectal carcinoma.353 The expression levels of miRNAs are tumor-speci c and can be used for early cancer diagnosis.354Depending on their downstream signaling e ect on genes and gene products, miRNAs can be up- or down-regulated in cancers. Up-regulatedmiRNAs are proposed to have an oncogenic e ect, whereas down-regulated miRNAs are suggested to have a tumorsuppressor e ect. There are clearly many nucleic acid-based targets of interest for sensor development. A variety of electrochemical methods have been investigated for this application that either covalently orChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXVnoncovalently labels NAs analytes with redox-active reagents. Furthermore, several systems that are essentially \"reagentless \" are also available for this application. The key challenges in thisarea relate to attaining high levels of sensitivity, speci city, and the validation of performance levels in clinical samples. 4.2. Electrochemical Detection of Clinically Relevant Nucleic Acids Electrochemistry of NAs is a key area within the eld of biomolecular electrochemistry, de ned by Saveant as \"molecules for electrochemistry and electrochemistry for molecules \".355The ability of the stacked base pairs of DNA to provide a pathway for ecient charge-transfer was recognized in 1962.356This interesting nding has stimulated numerous studies,357366 resulting in three theories underlying the mechanism of long- distance charge-transfer in DNA: (1) one-step charge transportby long-distance to acceptor via the DNAbases; 367(2) multistep random movement from donor to acceptor involving short-distance tunneling intervals connectedby nucleotides which serve as charge resting sites;368and (3) classical hopping in which the charge resides on one base orseveral adjacent bases then thermal fluctuations activate the charge migration along the DNA duplex.369It has been demonstrated that the dominant mechanism for charge-transferin DNA is multistep hopping.370This mechanism involves a complex process in which the charge migrates by hoppingthrough the double helix until it is irreversibly captured in areaction that damages DNA bases. 371 Several approaches exist for the detection of nucleic acids, including (i) sensors modi ed with a MIP speci c to a nucleic acid sequence;372(ii) label-free hybridization between either a neutral PNA or negatively charged DNA or RNA capture probeand the target nucleic acid; an external redox mediator is usuallyincluded in the detection solution to monitor the change in theinterfacial resistance resulting from altering either the surface netcharge or the compactness of the surface-immobilized probe/hybrid; 373,374(iii) hybridization between a capture probe and a prelabeled nucleic acid with a redox probe or an enzyme;375(iv) hybridization between the capture probe and the target nucleicacid only in the presence of adaptor strands that arec o m p l e m e n t a r yt ob o t ho ft h e m ; 376,377(v) hybridization between the capture probe and the nucleic acid, followed bythe capture of a protein378or antibody379specic to which thetarget nucleic acid is hybridized to an immobilized capture probeand a signaling probe modi ed with a redox label, 380an enzyme,381,382or a carrier of primers to initiate displaces a redox-labeled secondarystrand from its hybrid with the capture probe, causing amodulation of the electrochemical signal; 385in another format, the target nucleic acid binds to the secondary strand, causing theredox-labeled capture probe to regain its original conforma-tion; 386(viii) hybridization between a redox-labeled hairpin capture probe and a target nucleic acid, which is accompanied byeither bringing the redox label close to the electrode surface(signal-ON) 34or forcing it away (signal-OFF);387(ix) hybrid- ization between the target nucleic acid and capture probe thatcontains a restriction site for endonucleases; in the absence of thetarget nucleic acid, the capture probe is digested; 388and (x) hybridization between the capture probe and target nucleic acid is followed by target recycling by digesting the capture probe inthe formed duplex by duplex-speci cn u c l e a s e exonuclease, to create an isothermal ampli cation cycle.390 In general, MIP-based sensing strategies are tedious and lack the sensitivity required for clinical analysis. However, the use of nanostructured transducers could enhance the sensitivitysignicantly by improving the interaction between the recognition element and the target analyte. The use of adaptor strands in nucleic acid analysis was found to enhance the selectivity of detection. However, the adaptor strands should bedesigned on the basis of the target sequence, which couldcomplicate the assay. An alternative strategy is to use hairpin capture probes over 25 nucleotides in length. Remarkably, hairpin probes can enhance the selectivity of the sensor,particularly in SNP recognition, because they allow as much as1014\u00b0Cd ierence in T mbetween perfectly matched and SNP- containing double helices as compared to 1 6\u00b0C often observed for linear probes.391 Prelabeling of the target sequence is advantageous due to the signal-ON sensing mode of the sensor. However, the tedious andexpensive procedure for target sequence labeling restricts its real- time application. An e cient alternative to produce signal-ON sensors is to utilize hairpin capture probes and ne-tune the experimental conditions, such as the probe length 392and density393and electrochemical parameters, such as the frequency in SWV394and potential scan rate in CV.395In addition, a simple truncation of the DNA hairpin sequence can allow reversal of thesensing mode from \"ON-OFF \"to the more attractive \"OFF- ON \". 395 Displacement-based methods are considered promising for clinical analysis due to their simplicity and versatility. However,the sensitivities of these methods are often low and insu cient for clinical analysis. On the contrary, sandwich-based hybrid- ization assays often result in ultrasensitive analysis of In such assays, the capture probe speci cally hybridizes with one portion of the target sequence, and the signaling probehybridizes with the other portion of the target. These three components form a capture probe target oligonucleotide signaling probe sandwich format. Like sandwich assays forproteins, sandwich assays for nucleic acids do not requireprelabeling of the target sequence. In addition, the capture and signal probes have minimal interaction in the absence of the target, which ensures a high signal change upon target bindingand relatively low background signals. Methods based on enzymatic ampli cation may allow nucleic acid analysis down to the subattomolar level. 382However, the cost of the enzymes and the multiple steps involved in the analysis often restrict their use in clinical analysis. Replacingenzymes by nanoparticles or quantum dots often results insignicantly ampli ed signals. In addition, sacri cial mediators can be used as electron sinks to favor the catalytic recycling of a redox label. For example, ampli cation of the signal of a ferrocene or methylene blue label can be achieved by includingferricyanide in the analysis bu er. Similarly, redox cations such as [Ru(NH 3)6]3+(RuHex) electostatically associated with nucleo- tide phosphate residues can be electrocatalytically recycled usingferricyanide, resulting in higher detection sensitivity. 4.2.1. DNA Detection Strategies. 4.2.1.1. Genomic DNA. The analysis of disease-speci c gene mutations in DNA, such as those in KRAS ,p53,BRCA1 ,BRAF ,APC, and EGFR , is desired because these genes have high mutation frequency in manytumor types and are associated with cancer progression. 396,397 The presence of these mutated genetic sequences in the plasma/Chemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXWserum is generally associated with larger tumors and advanced staging.398 A sequence-speci c MIP-based amperometric sensor for the p53gene mutation fabricated by electropolymerizing o-phenylenediamine and single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleo- tide (ssODN) ITO-coated glass substrate.372 The 17-mer ssODN template is associated with the pointmutation of human prostate cancer susceptibility gene p53. The sensor showed a linear current response to the target ss-ODNconcentration ranging from 10 aM to 300 fM. An amperometric sensing platform was reported for the detection of EGFR gene mutation in the saliva of NSCLC patients. 399In this method, a capture probe for the mutant was copolymerized with pyrrole on the surface of an array of goldelectrodes. A fluorescently labeled signaling probe for the mutant was incubated with the saliva sample. Hybridization was performed using a cyclic-square wave electric eld at200 mV for 1 s and +500 mV for 1 s for 5 cycles of 10 s each. Thecontinuous variation of the electrical eld facilitated the hybridization exclusively of the perfectly matched sequence. AHRP-conjugated anti fluorescein antibody was added followed by a mixture of TMB and H 2O2. This sensor allowed for the detection of the L858R point mutation and exon 19 deletion intheEGFR gene. An amperometric sensor for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was constructed using a DNA tetrahedron structure,displaying a pendant capture probe at one vertex and three thiolgroups at the other three vertices. 400This 3D nanostructure was strongly anchored on a gold electrode by the three thiol-modi ed 55-mer DNA strands at the base of the \"pyramid \", leaving a free- standing 80-mer capture probe at the top. The tetrahedronassembly process was extremely fast (within 2 min) with a yieldof over 85%, as shown in Figure 10 . Subsequent to target hybridization, a biotin-tagged reporter probe was hybridized with the capture followed modi cation with conjugated HRP ofTMB and H 2O2, the SNP discrimination factors between a perfectly matched and three SNP-containing sequences were 150, 1000, and 10 000, respectively. In a closely related approach, a streptavidin-conjugated HRP enzyme was utilized as a signaling tag.401Upon the addition of TMB and H 2O2, amperometric measurements permitted SNP detection with complete discrimination between the perfectlymatched and the G Am u t a t e d p53 gene sequence. Remarkably, the sensitivity of nucleic acid-based sensors wassignicantly enhanced by coating the sensor surface with a ternary self-assembled monolayer. This was achieved by coupling the cyclic and linear con guration of the back ller.402For example, coimmobilization of the thiolated capture probe and,-alkanedithiol dithiothreitol, followed by the assembly of mercaptohexanol, was shown to reduce the LOD of a DNA target to the zeptomolar level. A nonenzymatic voltammetric clamp assay for SNPs was developed using a PNA probe (complementary to the mutatedtarget) immobilized onto the surface of a gold nanostructuredmicroelectrode. 403PNA probes, which carry no molecular charge at neutral pH, enhance the binding a nity to target nucleic acid and consequently improve the detection sensitivity.404A collection of oligonucleotides was utilized to sequester closelyrelated sequences in solution, thus allowing only the mutated sequence to bind to the sensor surface. This sensor was employed for the detection of KRAS gene mutation, which is associated with lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers, 405as shown inFigure 11 . In addition, the sensor was utilized to detect BRAF gene mutation, which is associated with melanoma.406 Remarkably, DPV measurements indicated that the signal increase was dependent on the target concentration over 6orders of magnitude with a LOD of 0.1 pM. A signal-ON voltammetric sensor for p53gene mutation was fabricated using a biotin-labeled capture probe with a hairpin structure immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode, with astem designed to contain a restriction site for endonucleaseenzyme EcoR1. 388In the absence of target DNA, the probe was cleaved by EcoRI and the biotin tag dissociated. In contrast, the capture probe was opened by the target hybridization, deformingthe restriction site and moving the biotin tag away from theelectrode. Afterward, streptavidin-conjugated gold nanoparticles capped with multiple ferrocene signaling probes were introduced into the stem region to generate the signal. DPV measurementswere used to demonstrate that the currents generated for SNP-containing DNA were signi cantly lower than those generated by a perfectly matched sequence. An electrochemical sensor for the KRAS gene mutations was constructed using a LNA probe immobilized onto the surface of aGNPs-coated gold electrode. 407The probe was cleaved by EcoRI in the wild-type DNA but could not be cleaved in the presence of mutations. The di erence before and after enzymatic cleavage was then monitored by (CC) in the presenceof Ru(NH 3)63+, with a LOD of 0.5 fM. Another voltammetric sensor for KRAS gene mutations was developed using a hairpin capture probe modi ed with a thiolated methylene blue at the 3 terminus and ferrocene in the middle of the loop, immobilized onto the surface of a goldelectrode. 408In the presence of the target DNA, a duplex with a blunt end was formed, which triggered the Exo III cleavage process accompanied by the release of the target DNA. As aresult, the methylene blue tags were forced away from the goldelectrode surface, and the ferrcoene tags were brought close to the electrode surface, as shown in Figure 12 . These changes led to the decrease of the oxidation peak current of methylene blue,accompanied by the increase of that of ferrocene. The values ofI Fc/IMBfor SNP-containing sequences were only 43% and 24% of that for a perfectly matched sequence.

The probe was hierarchically assembled from three thiolated 55-nt DNA fragments and one 80-nt DNA fragment carrying the probe sequence, mixed instoichiometric equivalents in bu er. The nanostructure was anchored to the gold surface through three thiols at the base of the \"pyramid \", leaving a free-standing probe at the top. Reprinted with permission from ref 400.

A voltammetric sensor for BRCA1 gene mutations was fabricated using a PNA probe immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.373Because the PNA-modi ed electrode surface is electrically neutral, no electrostatic interaction took placebetween the electrode surface and the negatively charged redox mediator, [Fe(CN) 6]3/4. After hybridization with the target DNA, the redox mediator was prevented from freely accessingthe electrode surface, due to the electrostatic repulsion between the mediator and the formed hybrid. Nuclease S1 was then applied to the PNA/DNA duplex on the electrode surface where perfectly matched PNA/DNA duplex could not be hydrolyzedby the nuclease. CV experiments demonstrated that nuclease S1 treatment of the mismatched PNA/DNA duplex led to recoveryof the current signal approaching a value close to that beforetarget hybridization.

The sample (1) was mixed with clamp sequences (2) to sequester the wild-type sequence and all of the mutants except the target sequence. All of the mutants and the wild-type sequence were hybridized to the respecti ve complementary clamps in solution (3), except the target sequence, for example, 134A (green). The sample was then incubated with the PNA probe- modied microsensor, and only the target mutant nucleic acids hybridized to an immobilized PNA probe.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXYA polarity-switching voltammetric sensor for SNPs utilized a DNA capture probe modi ed with centrally located methylene blue and immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.387In the absence of target, the double-stranded stem of the probecreated proximal rigidity, while the centrally located methyleneblue did not interact with the single-stranded DNA loop. In theperfectly matched hybrid, a decreased SWV current was observedpresumably due to the con nement of the methylene blue tag within the DNA duplex, which lowered the probability of themethylene blue approaching the electrode (signal-OFF). In themismatched hybrid, the interaction was disrupted, giving rise tothe opposite signal polarity (signal-ON), as shown in Figure 13 . Other reports have demonstrated enhanced flexibility for bulge- containing duplexes as compared to perfectly matched analoguesusing ferrocene-modi ed PNA probes and voltammetric measurements. 410,411 A sensor for SNPs was constructed using a methylene blue-labeled DNA probe immobilized onto thesurface of a gold electrode.34The capture probe comprised a 9-base target recognition region at the 3 -end and an 8-base target recognition region at the 5 -end. The two regions were attached through a 10-T spacer. Target hybridization broughttogether the two domains to form a \"closed \"structure, which conned the methylene blue label close to the electrode surface for ecient electron transfer, as shown in Figure 14 . Using ACV, a LOD of 200 fM was obtained. In addition, SNP-containingsequences did not cause a signi cant change in the current. A clamp-like voltammetric sensing strategy for SNPs was developed using a methylene-labeled DNA probe immobilizedonto the surface of a gold electrode. 412The clamp-like probe c o u l db i n dt oat a r g e ts e q u e n c et h r o u g ht w od i s t i n c tcomplementary regions to form a triplex DNA structure, thusbringing the methylene blue label close to the electrode surface,as shown in Figure 15 . This approach provided over 2000-fold discrimination e ciency between perfectly matched and SNP- containing sequences. Another voltammetric sensor for SNPs featured a hairpin DNA probe as the recognition and signaling probe, the shorter arm of which was labeled with methylene blue at its free end. 413 The recognition probe was immobilized onto the surface of agold electrode using a thiol group located internally, in the turnregion of the hairpin. Hybridization of a target DNA with thelonger arm of the hairpin displaced the shorter arm, allowing theredox probe to approach the electrode surface and transferelectrons, as shown in Figure 16 . SWV measurements revealed 800% signal increase at the saturating target level with a LOD of50 pM. Also, the sensor can readily discriminate betweenperfectly matched sequences and those containing SNPs. A voltammetric sensor integrated within a micro fluidic device was designed to perform electrochemical melting curve measure-ments and subsequently discriminate between homozygous andheterozygous SNPs in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE ) Noteworthy is that speci c alleles of ApoE strongly a ect individual risk of late-onset Alzheimer 's disease. The device employs methylene blue-labeled surface-bound DNA probescomplementary to the SNP-containing target sequence. The probe was modi ed at the other end with trithiol to ensure the probe stability at higher temperatures.415To distinguish between perfectly matched and SNP-containing sequences, the chip washeated until the formed duplex completely melted. Because of itshigher hybridization energy, the perfectly matched target meltedat a higher temperature, bringing the methylene blue group closeto the electrode surface and leading to an increase in the ACV Figure 13. Polarity-switching sensor exploited the probe flexibility and the interaction between the methylene blue label and dsDNA to tune the electron transfer between the methylene blue molecules and the electrode, so that the sensor reported a \"signal-OFF \"response from the perfectly matched target, but an opposite \"signal-ON \"response from the SNP-containing target.

On the other hand, SNP-containing sequences showed an increase in current at lower melting temperature. Also,impedimetric monitoring of DNA denaturation by NaOH wasperformed using a DNA probe immobilized onto a nanocrystal-line-diamond electrode. 416This approach allowed for fast localization and identi cation of SNPs. An impedimetric sensor for SNP was fabricated using a PNA capture probe immobilized onto the surface of a goldelectrode.417The interaction of metal ions with the DNA/ PNA hybrid was studied in the presence of [Fe(CN) 6]3/4, and the charge-transfer resistance was found to decrease in the orderof Ni 2+>C o2+>Z n2+>M g2+. This was ascribed to the strong interaction of Ni2+with the N7 of purines or N3 of pyrimidines on the PNA/DNA lm. Using Ni2+, it was possible to detect a single C T mismatch. This approach was further utilized to detect SNPs in the ApoE gene with target DNA levels down to 10 fM.418In a closely related approach, a DNA capture probe wasutilized instead of PNA in the presence of Zn2+.419The eect of the SNP position on the electrochemical signal was studied in 25- mer DNA sequences. A large di erence in the charge-transfer resistance between perfectly matched and SNP-containing sequences was observed in middle mismatches as compared to terminal ones. A gap electrical sensor for SNP leveraged the self-catalytic growth of unmodi ed GNPs as conductive bridges.420In the presence of target DNA, the formed dsDNA product could not adsorb onto the surface of GNPs due to electrostatic repulsion, which made the GNPs exhibit excellent glucose oxidase-like catalytic activity. Such catalytic activity enlarged the diameters of GNPs in the glucose and HAuCl 4solution and resulted in a dramatically increased conductance. In the absence of the target DNA, the catalytic activity sites of GNPs were fully blocked by ssDNA due to the noncovalent interaction between nucleotide bases and GNPs, as shown in Figure 17 . Conductance change measurements revealed the ability of the sensor to discriminate between perfectly matched and SNP-containing sequences. 4.2.1.2. Epigenetic Alterations. Heritable changes in gene expression that do not depend on the DNA sequence are referred to as \"epigenetic \". Genomic DNA methylation is frequently observed at the cytosine base in the CG-rich region, called CpG islands, located in the promoter and the rst exon of genes.421 Cytosine methylation occurs at the 5 position of cytosine replacing a hydrogen atom with a methyl group without interfering with CG pairing.422In normal cells, most CpG islands spanning the promoter regions are nonmethylated, and their downstream genes are transcriptionally active. On the other hand, when CpG island promoters in cancer cells are methylated, their downstream genes become subsequently silenced.423 Hypermethylation of these CpG islands is associated withdiseases as a result of the transcriptional inactivation of classic tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation has been linked to leukemia, lung, thyroid, pancreas, and prostate tumors, among many other diseases including male sterility.424,425Several studies have revealed the presence of methylated DNA in theplasma/serum of cancer patients. Hence, detection of methylated DNA may represent a means to monitor cancer progression and Figure 16. A signal-ON sensor employing an asymmetric hairpin probe. The sensor operated via a strand displacement mechanism. Hybrid-ization of the target DNA with the longer arm of a probe molecule led to the liberation of the shorter arm, increasing the e ciency with which the methylene blue redox reporter at its end approaches the electrode surface. This resulted in a readily measurable increase in Faradaic current. Reprinted with permission from ref 413. Copyright 2011 American Chemical Society. Figure 17.

Genes that are frequently hypermethylated in cannot be used to study methylation because both bases exhibit identical Watson Crick base-pair behavior. Thus, current DNA methylation assays involve methods designed to distinguish between C and methylcytosine(mC) in oligonucleotides. Bisul te treatment,427,428restriction enzymes,429and molecules methylation assays, the deaminated and thenconverted to U, whereas mC remains almost unchanged due to its low reactivity.432Restriction enzymes catalyze the scission reaction of a speci c base sequence. When the C in the speci c sequence is methylated, the scission is inhibited. Several studieshave also revealed the use of antibodies,431binding proteins,433 and metal complexes with high a nity for mC.434 A voltammetric sensor was constructed for direct oxidations of mC and C in the 5 -CG-3 sequence using a sputtered nanocarbon lm electrode CpG oligonucleotides oxidation of the longer CpG oligonucleotides was insu cient for obtaining the oxidation currents of these bases because the CG-rich sequence inhibited the direct oxidation of each base due tothe native conformation and its very low di usion coe cient. Using SWV after P1 treatment allowed for 4.4 times highersensitivity and a wider concentration range for mC detectionwith a resolution capable of detecting a subtle methylationdierences in the 60-mer CpG oligonucleotides. Another study studied the CV and SWV responses of 250 M C, mC, and 6-mer oligonucleotides using screen-printed graphite electrodes. 436 Good reproducibility of the electrochemical behavior of C and mC was observed with a potential separation of about 100 mV,which allowed for a clear discrimination between C and mC. Another voltammetric method for methylated DNA relied on the conversion of C into U using sodium bisul te.437The sensor was prepared using a complementary DNA probe to 27- or 33- mer ssDNA from the GSTP1 promoter region, immobilized onto the surface of a platinum microelectrode precoated with apolypyrrole bilayer lm. After bisul te treatment, the sites where the U base is present in the non methylated DNA were no longera base pair match to the G bases on the complementary probeDNA. Using CV, 0.1 M methylated DNA sequences were successfully measured with an average percent di erence of 25.4% as compared to nonmethylated respective sequences.Using EIS in another study permitted the detection ofmethylated GSTP1 sequences down to 29 nM. 438 In a closely related approach, a voltammetric sensor was prepared using a PNA probe immobilized onto the surface of aGNPs-modi ed GCE, precoated with a choline monolayer.439 The purpose of using choline was to provide a stable monolayer with positively charged N+(CH 3)3polar head groups, which could increase the density of edge-plane-like active sites of theGCE for the assembly of GNPs, as shown in Figure 18 . DPV measurements permitted the pro ling of the methylation status ofp53after bisul te treatment, and the peak current was found proportional to the logarithm of target concentration in the rangefrom 50 pM to 96 nM, with a LOD of 18 pM. Another voltammetric sensi ng platform referred to as \"eMethylsorb \"relied on the base-dependent a nity interaction of DNA with a gold electrode. 440Briefly, DNA samples extractedfrom cell lines were treated with bisulphite to convert nonmethylated C into U. These samples were then convertedto ssDNA amplicons by an asymmetric PCR step, where mC wascopied into G, and U into A. The resulting ssDNA ampliconswere directly adsorbed onto a gold electrode, and their amountwas determined using DPV, as shown in Figure 19 . It was noted that the relative current response decreased linearly withincreasing methylation percentage in the mixture. A voltammetric sensor array integrated with a micro fluidic device was constructed for the detection of oxidation in intactDNA. 441DNA can be oxidatively damaged by reactive oxygen species, which may lead to carcinogenesis.442,443The device featured osmium bipyridyl poly(vinylpyridine) chloride lms assembled layer-by-layer with polyions onto gold sensors. UsingSWV, the device was successfully utilized to detect one guanosine, 8-oxodG, per 6600 nucleobases. 4.2.1.3. referred short tandem repeats (STRs), are repetitive DNA triplets rangingin size from 2 to 6 bp that form variable-length stretches of DNA.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXABThey can be found at many loci within the human genome. The biology of microsatellites has been studied extensively, and theiranalysis has seen application in several elds including forensic analysis, paternity/kinship testing, and disease-related linkageanalysis. 444Therst reports about microsatellites involved patients with lung cancer445and head and neck cancer.446To date, more than 12 human genetic diseases including Huntingtondisease (triplets CAG-CTG), (GAA- TTC) have been found to be associated with the expansion oftrinucleotide repetitive sequences such as CTG, CGG, or GAArepeats. 447,448The d(CGG) ntrinucleotide expansion in the coding sequence of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 gene leadsto the gradual damage of the brain.449 An impedimetric sensor was developed for the detection of XCG trinucleotide repeats (X: C, T) using a naphthyridinecarbamate dimer (NCD) of nucleic acids immobilized onto thesurface electrode. 450The selective binding of naphthyridine dimer to guanine-rich special DNA sequenceswas ascribed to the hydrogen bonding between the naphthyr-idine group and G base. 451After the sensor was incubated with trinucleotide repeats, the relationship between the charge-transfer resistance and the logarithm of tandem repeatsconcentration was linear from 1 nM to 1 M. A voltammetric sensor for CGG repeats was constructed using a complementary DNA probe immobilized onto the surface of agold electrode. 452Subsequent to capturing the tandem repeat, the with a bifunctional electrochemicalprobe, ferrocene-labeled NCD2. SWV measurements revealedthe to detect trinucleotide repeats down to50M. 4.2.1.4. Viral DNA. A DNA virus is a virus in which the genetic material is DNA and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNApolymerase. The DNA can be either double- or single-stranded.Viruses, such as Epstein Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis virus and human papillomavirus (HPV), are etiological factorsin several malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 453 cervical cancer,454head neck squamous cell carcinoma,455 Hodgkin 's disease,456and lymphoid A voltammetric sensor for the HPV HPV16E7p was fabricated using an anthraquinone-labeled pyrrolidinyl PNA probe immobilized onto the surface of achitosan-modi ed screen-printed carbon electrode.458Hybrid- ization with the viral DNA was studied by measuring theelectrochemical signal of the anthraquinone label using SWV.The calibration curve exhibited a linear range from 20 nM to 12M, with a LOD of 4 for HPV DNA sequences HPV16E7p andHPV45E6 was constructed using a capture DNA probe immobilized onto the surface of an array ofgold electrodes. 381Subsequent to viral DNA capture, a second hybridization was carried out between the terminal part of theviral DNA and a HRP-modi ed reporter DNA. After incubation with TMB, the levels of HPV16E7p and HPV45E6 were determined in the linear ranges of 0.1 10 and 0.1 1 nM, with LOD values of 490 and 110 pM, respectively. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for HBV DNA was fabricated using a capture DNA probe immobilized onto thesurface of an array of gold electrodes. 459Silver nanoparticles were modied with an oligo(d)A and the reporting probe, followed by hybridization with silver nanoparticles modi ed with oligo(d)T. The formed tag was found to show an aggregated nanostructure 10 times larger than the individual nanoparticle, as shown inFigure 20 . In the presence of HBV DNA, the sandwich was formed and the target was subsequently analyzed using DPV in the linear range from 10 aM to 100 fM, with a LOD of 5 aM. A sandwich-based voltammetric assay utilized DNA-wrapped CNTs as electrochemical labels for detection of HBV DNA.460 The presence of target DNA mediated the formation of asandwiched complex between the DNA-wrapped CNT and ahairpin DNA capture probe immobilized on magnetic beads.After treatment with N,N-dimethylformamide, the collected sandwiched complex released the bare CNTs and facilitated theremoval of magnetic beads from the electrode surface. The bareCNTs were then assembled on the electrode surface andmediated e cient electron transfer between the electrode and the electroactive species, ferrocenecarboxylic acid. Using DPV,the target DNA was measured in the linear range from 1 pM to100 nM, with a LOD of 0.9 pM. An electrocatalytic fluid displacement method for HCV detection was designed and tested using a PNA capture probeimmobilized onto the surface of a nanostructured micro-electrode. 461After hybridization with the viral DNA, comprised ruthenium hexamine,ferricyanide, mercaptopropionic acid, cysteamine, and potassiumtetrachloroplatinate, was introduced into the sensing chamber.On the application of a potential, Ru(NH 3)63+attracted to the negatively charged backbone of the formed hybrid, was oxidizedat the sensing electrode, and platinum was simultaneouslyelectrodeposited at a mesh electrode in the read-out chamber.The current was further ampli ed by two additional reducing agents in the electrocatalytic solution, including mercaptopro-pionic acid and cysteamine. After the application of the potential,H 2O2was introduced into the read-out chamber. The deposited platinum catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2into O2, and the formed bubbles displaced a fluid to reveal a color change, as shown in Figure 21 . This sensor allowed for viral DNA detection with a LOD of 100 fM. A paper-based voltammetric sensor for HBV was fabricated using a hollow-channel paper analytical device to accommodatemicrometer-scale particles, and a convenient slip layer for timingthe incubation steps. 462The capture DNA probe was modi ed at one end with magnetic microbeads and with silver nanoparticlesat the other end.

UsingASV, the level of viral DNA was quanti ed in the linear range up to 500 pM, with a LOD of 85 pM. 4.2.1.5. Mitochondrial DNA. Human cells contain several hundreds of copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) thatencodes respiratory chain subunits, pathogenicity have beenidentied within the human mtDNA. 463Several mutations have been observed in patients with lung cancer, bladder cancer,head and neck cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. 464These mutations have been detected in bodily fluids, including saliva, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage.465For instance, the mitochondrially encoded is translated into NADH dehydrogenase 6. This protein is part ofa large multienzyme assembly known as complex I, which is one of the enzyme complexes necessary for oxidative phosphor- ylation within mitochondria. Several mutations in the MT-ND6 gene have been identi ed in patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy 466and Leigh syndrome.467Mutations and mitochondrial encephalopathies.470472 A voltammetric sensor for MT-ND6 was constructed using a complementary DNA probe immobilized onto the surface ofGNPs-modi ed GCE. 473The hybrid formed was subsequently digested with BamHI, a restriction enzyme that cleaves after the 5-G. The electrode was then immersed in methylene blue or neutral red for electroactivation followed by signal detectionusing DPV. An impedimetric sensor was fabricated to monitor the PCR amplication of mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase gene using a forward primer immobilized onto the surface of a GCEprecoated with a polymerized lm of pyrrole and pyrrolylacrylic acid. 474This sensor permitted the detection of as few as 2 copies L1. 4.2.2. RNA Detection Strategies. The analysis of messenger RNAs and microRNAs is the focal point of theelectrochemical RNA analysis area. RNA sequences that areimportant targets for cancer monitoring, infectious diseasediagnosis, and organ transplant assessment have all beenanalyzed electrochemically using a variety of approaches. 4.2.2.1. Messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA is the intermediate between genes encoded by DNA and the nal protein products. Hence, the mRNA level usually re flects the concentration of the corresponding protein. The copy number of a speci c mRNA in a particular cell type can vary signi cantly from one mRNA to another, and depends on a series of factors related to the functionof the corresponding protein. Tumors typically exhibit aberrantmRNA expression, and hence mRNA can be used as a marker forcancer monitoring. 475In breast cancer patients, the level of CCND1 mRNA has been identi ed in patients with poor survival and who were nonresponsive to tamoxifen.476In addition, the levels of TERT mRNA and EGFR mRNA in lung cancer patients have been correlated with tumor size, metastasis, and diseaserecurrence. 477Furthermore, the presence of tyrosinase mRNA has been demonstrated in the serum of one-third of patients with malignant melanoma.348 A displacement-based voltammetric signal-ON sensor for survivin mRNA was constructed using a ferrocene-labeled stem-loop DNA probe immobilized onto the surface of a goldelectrode. 386Survivin is an apoptosis inhibition protein found in most cancer cells, such as breast, ovarian, cervical, andhepatocellular carcinomas. 478In this report, the immobilized probe was then hybridized with a partial complementary survivin antisense oligonucleotide to open the stem-loop structure and reduce the electron transfer.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXADwith the sensor, lysed with Triton, and the released mRNA subsequently displaced the antisense strand and retrieved thestem-loop structure. DPV experiments revealed that the peakcurrent exhibited a linear correlation with the logarithm ofmRNA concentration ranging from 50 pM to 50 nM. A voltammetric sensing platform was developed for detection of the BCR-ABL mRNA, which is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. 479This platform was based on amino acid/ nucleic acid chimeras (ANAs) immobilized onto the microelectrodes. The ANAs weredesigned to speci cally bind to the junction region between the two fused genes, bcrandablin the BCR-ABL gene fusion. Using a catalytic redox probe, [Ru(NH 3)6]3+/[Fe(CN)6]3,D P V allowed for the detection of BCR-ABL mRNA in as few as 10 K562 cells after lysis. Chip-based voltammetric sensors referred to as fractal circuit sensors were applied to the IL-6,IL-10 , and ATP11B mRNAs that correlate with the development of primary graft dysfunction in recipients after transplant.480The sensors made from electrodeposited gold were templated in apertures created in an SU-8 layer patternedover gold contacts on a glass chip. Electrodeposition was carriedout using conditions that facilitate rapid growth and generationof fractal structures extending into solution. Afterward, thesensors were modi ed with the complementary PNA sequences for the target mRNAs. The donor lung tissue extracted by atransplant surgeon was chemically lysed in 5 min using nonionicdetergents compatible with the sensor. The electrochemicalcurrents were generated by a label-free, redox-active, [Ru- (NH 3)6]3+/[Fe(CN)6]3reporter system. The [Ru(NH3)6]3+ electron acceptor complex is positively charged and binds to the sensors at levels that correspond to the amount of negativelycharged nucleic acid bound to the sensor. The [Fe(CN) 6]3 electron acceptor complex is negatively charged, and so it remains in solution to accept the electrons from [Ru(NH 3)6]3+ to induce multiple turnovers and current ampli cation,481,482as shown in Figure 22 . This sensor system exhibited a 335% signal gain using FraCS when challenged with solutions of 1 to 10 nMmRNA versus 52% using conventional electrodes. In addition, a signicant up-regulation of IL-6,IL-6/IL-10 ,a n d ATP11B mRNAs was observed in the donor lungs with poor outcomes. An integrated voltammetric sensor with a micro fluidic device was fabricated to allow the capture of circulating tumor cells(CTCs), cell lysis, and pro ling of PSA mRNA. 483In this work, a velocity valley chip was utilized to capture magnetic nanoparticle- bound CTCs, which were then electrochemically lysed, and the in situ released mRNA was analyzed using nanostructuredmicroelectrodes. Using DPV, CTCs as few as 2 cells per mL ofblood were captured with 97% e ciency within 1 h, and the level of PSA mRNA was determined, as shown in Figure 23 . Furthermore, integrated electrochemical lysis and mRNAdetection was previously reported using a variety of optimizedtemplates for bottom-up growth of nanostructured electro-des. 484486 complementary DNA probes immobilized onto the surface of vertically aligned goldmicroband electrode/SiO 2/gold microband wasrst hybridized with its speci c capture probe on the bottom side of the nanogap, followed by annealing of its poly(A) tail with poly(T) annealing probes on the top side of the nanogap, thusholding the hybridized mRNA strands vertically across the nanogap, as shown in Figure 24 . A subsequent deposition of silver nanowires, using AgNO 3/hydroquinone, alongside the mRNA strands bridged the nanogap and consequently produceda substantial change in conductance, allowing for the detection ofmRNA within the linear range from 0.5 fM to 1 pM, with a LODof 0.1 fM. A sandwich hybridization assay for human acute lymphocytic leukemia-related p185 BCR-ABL fusion transcript was designed using a DNA capture probe immobilized onto the surface ofmagnetic beads. 488Subsequent to mRNA capture, the terminal end of the captured strand was hybridized with a complementarysignal DNA probe immobilized onto the surface of CNTsfunctionalized with an HRP enzyme. The activity of enzyme wasmonitored measuring the enzymatic product inthe presence of 2-aminophenol and H 2O2substrate solution. Using SWV, the level of the 491bp target oncogene wasmeasured down to 1.7 pM. 4.2.2.2. MicroRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level by either translationalrepression or degradation of mRNAs. 489Mature miRNAs consist of22 nucleotides and are derived from hairpin precursor molecules of 70 100 nucleotides. It has been estimated that the human genome may encode for over 1000 miRNAs, which canregulate up to 60% of the mammalian genes.490The miRNAs Figure 22. Lung tissue mRNA assessment assay.

Using DPV, interrogation of the miRNA level was permissible up to 100 nM,with a LOD of 0.5 fM. Another hybridization-based voltam-metric assay was designed on the basis of a previously reported 501 methylene blue-labeled three-stem loop structure DNAsequence immobilized onto the surface of a gold micro-electrode. 502Subsequent to miRNA capture, the methylene blue label was cyclically oxidized electrochemically and reduced chemically using tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) in the detection solution to amplify the current. UsingSWV, a linear relationship was achieved between the current and miRNA concentration in the range from 0.1 fM to 500 pM, with a LOD of 0.1 fM. Hybridization-based impedimetric sensors for miRNA were constructed by coimmobilization of the capture probe and 4- mercaptoaniline onto the sur face of a gold electrode.375 Following hybridization with a ruthenium oxide nanoparticles- tagged target miRNA, a mixture of 3,3 -dimethoxybenzidine and H2O2was added. The polymer- ization initiator for The -dimethoxybenzidine) (PDB) and its insulat- ing power directly correlated to the concentration of the target miRNA in the range from 6 fM to 2 pM, with a LOD of 3 fM. In another approach, a neutral morpholino capture probe wasimmobilized onto the surface of an ITO-coated glass slide.503 Upon hybridization, the neutral surface of the biosensor became anionic by the hybridized miRNA strands. Subsequently, a mixture of HRP and H 2O2catalyzed the formation of an insulating lm of PDB. A linear relationship was established between the charge-transfer resistance and miRNA concen- tration in the range from 5 fM to 2 pM, with a LOD of 2 fM. An impedimetric sensor for miRNA based on target recycling was fabricated using a DNA capture probe immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.389After hybridization with miRNA, the capture probe was simultaneously digested by a duplex-specic nuclease, releasing the miRNA strands back to hybridize Figure 23.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAFwith the remaining capture probe, thus forming an isothermal amplication cycle. A linear relationship was obtained between the charge-transfer resistance and the concentration of the targetmiRNA in the linear range from 2 fM to 2 pM, with a LOD of 1.0fM. In another approach, T7 exonuclease quanti cation of miRNA was permitted in the range from 0.5 to 100 fM, with a LOD of 0.2 fM. Another target recycling approach relied on target miRNA displacement instead of captu re probe digestion. In this approach, a capture hairpin probe (H1) was immobilized ontothe surface of a GCE coated with porous graphene oxide/goldcomposite. 504The target miRNA that had been hybridized with the capture probe was subsequently displaced from the hybrid inthe presence of another stable hairpin DNA (H2). The releasedmiRNA became available for initiating another cycle. The hybridformed on the sensor surface was then hybridized with a ed with alcohol blue was intercalated into the DNAduplex. Subsequently, a catalysis cascade was initiated in whichalcohol oxidase catalyzed the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, accompanied by the generation of H 2O2. Cytochrome c and platinum nanoparticles then cooperativelycatalyzed the reduction of H 2O2, as shown in Figure 25 . Using DPV, a LOD of 0.4 fM was achieved. A voltammetric sandwich-based hybridization assay for miRNA used a molecular beacon capture probe immobilizedonto the surface of a gold electrode.505After hybridization with the target miRNA, silver nanoclusters encapsulated with asignaling probe were attracted to the electrode surface andproduced a current signal, in response to H 2O2reduction. Using DPV, the current intensity versus the logarithm of miRNAconcentration displayed a linear relationship in the range from100 fM to 10 nM, with a LOD of 67 fM. In another approach, asignaling probe modi ed with Cd 2+-functionalized titanium phosphate nanosphere and Ru(NH 3)63+molecules was utilized to produce an electrochemical signal.506Using SWV, the assay displayed a dynamic linear range extending from 1 aM to 10 pM,with a LOD of 0.8 aM. In another approach, a signaling probetagged with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated gold nanoclusterswas utilized. 507Both the capture and the signaling probes were ligated using a DNA ligase to increase the bearing strength. Thealkaline phosphatase-conjugated gold AgNO 3solution. Using LSV, the sensor displayed a linear dynamic range extending from 14 aM to 20fM, with a LOD of 4.6 aM. A gap hybridization assay for miRNA was designed using a DNA capture probe, helper DNA, and esterase 2-labeledsignaling probe. 508In the absence of miRNA, the gap between capture and detection DNA is not lled, and missing base stacking energy destabilized the hybridization complex. In thepresence of miRNA, the reporter enzyme was brought to theproximity of the electrode to catalyze the hydrolysis electrochemi- cally active. This assay allowed for miRNA analysis in the rangefrom 2 pM to 200 nM, with a LOD of 2 pM. Displacement voltammetric sensing of miRNA was achieved using a DNA capture probe immobilized onto the surface of agold electrode. 385The capture probe was hybridized with a miRNA with ferrocene-capped GNPs. In the presence ofthe target miRNA, the labeled miRNA was forced to dissociatefrom the electrode surface, resulting in a decrease in theferrocene oxidation current. Using CV, the miRNA level wasquanti ed down to 10 fM. An amperometric sensor for miRNA was constructed using a DNA tetrahedron structure displaying a capture probe at onevertex and three thiol groups at the other three vertices, whichwas immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode. 509After hybridization with the target miRNA, a biotin-tagged reporterprobe was hybridized with the capture probe followed by Figure 25. Preparation process for biobarcode conjugate labels and the proposed strategy for miRNA detection. Reprinted with permission from ref 504.

After incubation with a mixture of TMB and H 2O2, the target miRNA was detected with a LOD of 10 aM. In a closely related approach,a combination of the tetrahedral approach and hybridizationchain reaction was utilized for miRNA detection. 126Subsequent to target hybridization, two biotin-modi ed signaling probes were used to amplify the hybridization signal by adding an amplied chain on each target. Afterward, a streptavidin- conjugated HRP enzyme was attached to the chain reactionproduct followed by incubation with the TMB and H 2O2 mixture. Also, a LOD of 10 aM was achieved. In another approach, the target miRNA triggered the hybridization chain reaction of two species of metastable DNAhairpin probes, resulting in the formation of multiple G-quadruplex-incorporated long duplex DNA chains. Conse- quently, methylene blue selectively intercalated into the duplex DNA chain and the multiple G-quadruplexes, causing asignicant electrochemical signal drop. 383Using DPV, a linear relationship was established between the current signal and miRNA concentration in the range from 1 to 800 pM, with a LOD of 1 pM. A three-mode voltammetric sensor for miRNA was developed on the basis of the unique binding properties of the p19 protein(a component of the Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus), to small dsRNAs.378In this work, an RNA capture probe was immobilized onto the surface of a GNPs-modi ed screen-printed carbon electrode. In the hybridization modality referred to as H-SENS,hybridization between the target miRNA and its complementary immobilized probe caused an increase in the current signal due toan increase in the number of Ru IIIcations electrostatically attracted to the phosphate backbone of RNA. Binding of the p19 protein to the hybrid caused a large decrease in current density byblocking the electron transfer to the electrode surface, thusamplifying the signal (P-SENS). In the displacement modality(D-SENS), the hybrid-p19 complex attached to the sensor surface was incubated with a mixture of another miRNA and a nonthiolated complementary RNA probe. The a newly formedhybrid subsequently forced the p19 to dissociate from the surfaceand bind to the newly added hybrid, thus causing a shift in the signal, as shown in Figure 26 . Using SWV, a broad range of miRNA concentrations could be analyzed with a LOD of 5 aM.Another three-mode voltammetric sensor for miRNA wasdesigned on the basis of the previous concept. 379However, a DNA capture probe was used instead of RNA. In addition, an RNA/DNA speci c antibody was utilized instead of p19. Using SWV, a wide range of miRNA concentrations were determined,with a LOD of 8 fM. A DNA four-way junction-based voltammetric sensor for miRNA was also reported376This assay comprised a hairpin DNA capture probe and two DNA adaptor strands, whichcooperatively hybridize with both the capture probe and thetarget miRNA. Each adaptor strand has a fragment comple-mentary to the capture probe and a fragment complementary to the target miRNA. In the presence of the target miRNA, the two adaptor strands could hybridize to the capture probe andmiRNA, thus resulting in the formation of a quadripartitecomplex with a four-way junction structure. The formed complex subsequently captured a streptavidin molecule to cause a Figure 26. Schematic representation of the three-mode electrochemical sensor for detection of miRNAs.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAHsignicant decrease in the current (signal-OFF). Using SWV, the miRNA level could be determined down to 2 aM. On the basis ofthe previous approach, a signal-ON voltammetric sensor was developed by incorporating 1 methylene blue molecule at each end of the two adaptor strands. Electrochemical measurementswere performed in the presence of glucose oxidase, whichamplied the methylene blue reductive peak as a result of electrocatalysis, 377as shown in Figure 27 . SWV measurements revealed the ability of the sensor to quantify several miRNAs with concentrations down to 100 fM. A potentiometric sensor was constructed for the detection of encapsulated miRNAs in exosomes after a reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).510In this work, the PCR amplicons were captured via hybridization with a capture probe immobilized onto the surface of an array of gold electrodes. Thisassay allowed for the detection of miRNA levels down to 20 pM. A FET-based sensor for miRNA was fabricated using a DNA capture probe immobilized onto the surface of hafnium oxide- based dielectric-based silicon nanowires precoated with poly- L- By optimizing the surface fabrication and functionaliza-tion, a LOD of 1 fM was achieved.511Another FET-based sensor relied on the formation of a tripartite hybridization complex andsubsequent both-sided ligation of the target miRNA to a reporter and capture probe on the surface of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip with interdigitated goldelectrodes. 512The assay achieved a 1 with p19 was utilizedfor miRNA detection.513After hybridization between the target miRNA and the capture probe, the formed hybrid was quanti ed by measuring the change in the interfacial resistance caused by its binding to the surface p19. A LOD of 1 aM was reported. 4.3. Sensitivity Challenges for Electrochemical Nucleic Acid Detection Systems Despite so many developments in the eld of electrochemical nucleic acid analysis, only few systems have successfully becomecommercialized. For instance, GenMark Diagnostics (USA) oers the eSensor Technology, integrating micro fluidics and electrochemical detection. The voltammetric sensing platform is based on the hybridization between the target sequence and a ferrocene-labeled probe. CombiMatrix Diagnostics (USA) hasadvanced an oligonucleotide 000 individually addressable microelectrodes in a semi-conductor matrix. The approach is based on labeling the target sequence with biotin, which, subsequent to hybridization with the capture probe, binds to streptavidin-conjugated HRP. subsequently catalyzes the amperometric measurement of the product. Anotherstrategy for DNA base analysis was introduced by NanoporeTechnologies (UK) and relies on passing a single DNA strand through a nanopore of a chemically engineered membrane protein, -hemolysin. The sensitivity of nucleic acid detection methods is mainly driven by the e ciency of target capture by the sensor surface combined with the translation of a modest change in the interfacial layer into a large change in the electrical current. Todate, several approaches were sought to enhance the sensitivity ofdetection. Electrocatalytic reporters have been used over threedecades to amplify the signal and leverage the detection sensitivity. 514Optimization of the probe monolayer on the electrode surface has also been pursued by controlling the probelinker length and structure. However, it was noted that di ering linkers did not alter the electrochemical properties of theattached reporter and that the choice of the linker had no e ect on the sensor sensitivity. 515The use of neutral PNAs as capture probes instead of DNAs or RNAs has provided a considerable enhancement in sensitivity.516Because PNA lacks the phosphate backbone, it forms more thermally stable complexes with DNAand RNA. In addition, the number of electrocatalytic reportersbound to the unhybridized PNA strand is usually small.Consequently, the background current in electrocatalytic sensors Figure 27. Schematic representation of an electrocatalytic quadroprobe sensor for detection of microRNAs. (a) Thiol-modi ed universal interfacial probe (UIP) was immobilized onto the electrode surface. (b) Incubation of the sensor with a mixture of the target microRNA and the methylene blue- labeled adaptor strands, C (from cooperative) and H (from hybridization) strands, resulted in the formation of a characteristic redox peak.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAIis usually minimized, which could increase the overall sensitivity of the reporter system by more than 2000% as compared toconventional DNA probe-based systems. Also, DNA tetrahedralnanostructures provided another means to enhance thedetection sensitivity by improving the accessibility of targetnucleic acids, leading ampli cation strat- detection sensitivity. Eliminating ampli cation in nucleic acid sensing strategies may provide a better solution to speed up the analysis and also tosimplify the assay work flow to enable automation. For example, several integrated circuit strategies were adopted on the basis of electronic transduction schemes that monitor the change in theproperties of an underlying electronic material, such as FETs. 520 These devices combine superior performance with ease ofmanufacture using the same infrastructure leveraged by theelectronics industry. Direct electrochemical readout of nucleicacids represents an alternative solution for rapid moleculardetection challenges. In designing electrode-based detectors, it iscrucial to miniaturize the electrodes to minimize signal-to-noise;however ,electrodes that are too small will not permit su cient collisions between the slow-moving analytes and the capture probe to attain high sensitivity. 521 The fact that the hybridization e ciency between a target nucleic acid and a capture probe immobilized onto the electrodesurface is much lower than that observed for solution-basedprobes raises the question of whether the structure of the probemonolayer, and its accessibility to the target molecules, is convenient for target capture. Poor hybridization e ciency could be attributed to the electrode surface used for capture, whichessentially lays flat on the molecular length scale. In addition, high surface probe densities or probe probe interactions could hinder the e cient capture of target nucleic acids. 522The use of nanorough electrodes provided a means to improve the probeorientation by increasing the angle of de flection among the nearby probe molecules. For example, the use of 3D nano-electrode ensembles (NEEs) was found to improve the detectionlimit of the 23S rRNA of Helicobacter pylori by a factor of 10 6 when tested alongside the macroelectrodes made of bulk gold.523 Although NEEs had a signi cant impact on the detection sensitivity, the material chemistry involved in their fabricationmade the mass production of robust devices a challenge. Toaddress this problem, a combination of top-down and bottom-upfabrication was employed, allowing for the rapid fabrication of sensing electrodes with nanoscale features on a single planar integrated circuit. 524It was demonstrated that nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs) with ner nanostructures had higher probe density than smooth electrodes, which subsequentlyenhanced the hybridization e ciency by several orders of magnitude.525The performance of NMEs was impressive, and they allowed for the detection of clinically relevant levels ofnucleic acids. Nevertheless, analyzing slow-di using large mRNAs necessitates long incubation times to ensure that asucient number of these molecules will reach the sensor surface. 526To increase the interaction of target nucleic acids with NMEs, longer plating times were used to deposit gold structures with large footprints (100 m) and subsequently permit rapid accumulation of the slowly di using molecules.527 Although NMEs could be successfully used in multiplexed analysis, there was a need to contact each electrode individually.To address this drawback, a solution-based electronic switch was developed to allow for the interrogation of more than 100dierent analytes using a small number of electrical contacts.528 Another important step in the development of nucleic acid sensing platforms involved introduction into user-friendlydevices with integrated sample processing units that can handlecrude and complex sample matrices. A sample-processing unitbased on electrical lysis was successfully coupled to NMEsintegrated chip to allow for the release of nucleic acids after celllysis followed by their rapid capture on the surface of NMEs fordetection. 529,530This strategy showed promise in the analysis of gene expression in rare cancer cells isolated from the blood-stream of cancer patients.531,532 5. ELECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF PROTEINS The contents of human plasma represent secretions coming from all body tissues and may feature markers of physiological andpathological processes. Plasma contains tens of thousands of coreproteins, which span 10 11 orders of magnitude in abundance, from albumin to cytokines ( Figure 1 ). Proteins are the biological molecules most ubiquitously a ected in diseases. 533However, since 1998, the rate of introduction of new protein biomarkersapproved by the FDA has fallen to an average of one per year.This re flects the long path from biomarker discovery to clinical assay and the lack of coherent processes for assay develop-ment. 534Clinically relevant protein markers include tumor, cardiac, hepatic, in flammatory, and other biomarkers that do not fall into the previous categories. 5.1. Tumor Markers The National Cancer Institute de nes a biomarker as \"a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition ordisease. \"Tumor markers are one of the most valuable tools of early cancer detection, classi cation, staging, progression monitoring, and assessment of resistance to chemotherapy.There are more than 200 distinct diseases associated with canceraecting di erent parts of the body. 535In the absence of a tumor, the tumor markers usually exist at low levels. Upon tumorformation, the level changes, and hence clinical assays of cancermarkers must be rapid, selective, and sensitive enough to detectsmall changes in the level of the markers in complex biologicalfluids. 536 5.1.1. Prostate-Speci c Antigen (PSA). PSA is one of the rst tumor markers that has been used for screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA is a peptide that exists in eithera free form (fPSA) or a complex with a-1-antichymotrypsin(PSA-ACT). The total PSA level in healthy males is usually lessthan 4 gL 1and increases in prostate cancer patients.537 A displacement-based voltammetric immunosensor for PSA was developed using an anti-PSA antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a MWCNTs-modi ed GCE,538where the antibody was coupled with polytyrosine-tagged PSA. Notably, polytyr-osine is an electroactive polymer, which can liberate a largenumber of electrons upon elec trochemical oxidation and subsequently enhance the detection sensitivity. In the presenceof the target PSA, the labeled PSA was forced to dissociate fromthe sensor surface, and the current was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Using DPV, a LOD of 2.2 ng L 1was achieved. A sandwich-based amperometric immunosensor for PSA was fabricated using a DNA nanostructure as a sca old to precisely control the assembly of the antibody monolayer on the surface ofa gold electrode.539It was demonstrated that the detection sensitivity was dependent on the nanoscale spacing of theChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAJimmobilized antibodies provided by the DNA sca old. Subsequent to PSA capture, the immunosensor was incubatedwith HRP-conjugated anti-PSA-GNPs to further amplify thesignal. Amperometric analysis permitted a linear quanti cation of PSA with a LOD of 1 ng L 1. In addition, several sandwich-based electrochemical immunoassays for PSA were reported in whichthe capture antibody was coupled either directly to the electrode surface540or through iron oxide nanoparticles,541nanoporous gold foils,542or magnetic beads,543with LOD values of 5, 4, 6, and 100 ng L1, respectively. Also, gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles were modi ed with an anti-PSA antibody and dispersed in a PSA sample solution tocapture the PSA present in the sample. After binding to a HRP-conjugated anti-PSA antibody, a magnetic eld was applied to capture the target on a transducing electrode for electrochemical interrogation. 544Amperometric analysis of H2O2reduction, catalyzed by peroxidase, permitted detection of PSA levels downto 100 pg L 1. Impedimetric aptasensors for PSA were using thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and 3-mercapto-1- propanol coimmobilized onto the of a a scaold for PSA-speci c aptamer attachment.545The ssDNA was either directly hybridized with a DNA extension (primer) of theaptamer on the electrode surface or in solution prior toimmobilization onto the electrode surface. A dsDNA intercalatorwith a ferrocenyl redox label was synthesized to evaluate thefeasibility of the strategy. Impedimetric analysis permitted linearinterrogation of PSA level in the range from 50 ng L 1to 50 g L1, with a LOD of 0.5 ng L1. Also, a label-free aptasensor was designed by using a quinone- containing conducting polymer as a redox transducer and matrixto immobilize a PSA-speci c aptamer.546SWV allowed a linear quanti cation of PSA with a LOD in the gL1range. Furthermore, modi cation of the reporter antibody with CdSe/ ZnS quantum dots via biotin/streptavidin coupling was sought toamplify the detection sensitivity.547Quanti cation of PSA was performed through acidic dissolution of the quantum dots andstripping voltammetric detection of the Cd 2+released. This assay permitted the linear quanti cation of PSA level up to 20 gL1, with a LOD of 120 ng L1. A MIP-based sensing platform for PSA used MWCNTs decorated with manganese nanoparticles and functionalized witha thio-group to produce a nanoiniferter.548The iniferter is a chemical compound that simultaneously acts as initiator, transferagent, and terminator and hence the name ini-fer-ter. The nanoiniferter was subsequently utilized as a platform to synthesize a 3D MIP for PSA via a controlled-radical polymer-ization technique. Both SWV and DPSV were employed for PSAanalysis with LOD values of 250 fg L 1and 3 pg L1, respectively. Also, a MIP-based capacitive biosensor for PSA was fabricated bycopolymerizing methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimetha-crylate on the surface of a gold electrode. 549A linear relationship was established between the capacitance change and thelogarithm of PSA concentration in the range from 100 pg L 1 to 10 gL1, with a LOD of 80 pg L1. Recently, speci c peptides selected using the phase display technique were presented as an alternative to antibodies inbioassays. These peptides are more stable, economic, resistant toharsh conditions, and amenable to engineering at the molecularlevel. 550A\"signal-ON \"impedimetric sensor was based on the PSA ability to cleave a speci c peptide labeled with GNPs as a signal enhancer.551The onto a dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)-modi ed electrode. Subse-quently, GNPs were attached to the peptide and further treated with a positively charged surfactant, cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, to adsorb a negatively charged redox electrodesurface and subsequently increasing the interfacial resistance.The charge-transfer resistance was linear with PSA concen-trations ranging from 0.2 ng L 1to 45 gL1, with a LOD of 60 pg L1. Another impedimetric peptide-based impedimetric sensor was reported for PSA analysis.552T h ep r e s e n c eo fP S Aw a s accompanied by a decrease in the interfacial resistance due tothe peptide cleavage. This protein sensor had the ability tomonitor PSA in the range from 1 ng L 1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 1 ng L1. Gold nanowires have also been employed to facilitate ultrasensitive detection of PSA.553,554A FET-based sensing platform for PSA was developed using an anti-PSA antibodyimmobilized onto the surface of CMOS-compatible siliconnanowire FET. 555Experimental results revealed the ability of the sensor to detect low concentrations of PSA down to 1 pg L1. Reducing the sample volume using micro fluidics was also sought as a means to enhance the sensitivity of PSA detection. Avoltammetric sensor for PSA was fabricated using a micro fluidic sensor chip with a gold nanoelectrode array modi ed with metalized PNA-anti-PSA antibody conjugate.556Using CV, the level of PSA was quanti ed with a LOD of 10 ng L1.I na dierent study, PSA was mixed o ine with paramagnetic beads coated with anti-PSA antibodies and HRP enzymes, followed by capture of the formed complex on the surface of an anti-PSA-modied gold array electrode within a micro fluidic device.89A linear relationship was exhibited between the amperometriccurrent and PSA concentration with a LOD of 5 ng L 1. Another microfluidic chip-based sensing platform distinguished between prostate cancer and benign prostatic conditions via thedetermination of the fPSA to total PSA biochip arrays of microelectrodes functionalizedwith antitotal PSA antibodies. LOD of 1 gL 1. 5.1.2. Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA). CEA is a cell surface glycoprotein that has been used for the clinical diagnosisof breast, lung, pancreatic, gastric, colon, and ovarian tumors.The level of CEA is 2.5 gL 1among nonsmokers and 5 gL1 among smokers. A rising CEA level indicates the progression or recurrence of cancer.558 A displacement-based voltammetric immunosensor for CEA featured an anti-CEA antibody-modi ed sensing platform.559The immobilized antibody was coupled with multiarmed star-like platinum nanowires modi ed with CEA and HRP. enzyme was utilized to catalyze the reduction ofH 2O2. In the presence of the target CEA, the nanowires/enzyme complex was displaced from the sensing interface, causing areduction in the generated current. The relationship between theDPV peak current and CEA concentration was linear in the rangefrom 10 ng L 1to 60 gL1, with a LOD of 5 ng L1. Another displacement-based sensing platform relied on the ability of the CEA to displace TMB-conjugated CEA from the surface ofimmobilized anti-CEA antibody.560Using DPV, the level of CEA was quanti ed, with a LOD of 10 ng L1. A noncompetitive sandwich-based immunosensor for CEA was designed using anti-CEA antibody immobilized onto thesurface of magnetic graphene nanosheets.561A reverse-micelle method was used to encapsulate HRP-thionine within nanogoldChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem.

A flow-through immuno- assay coupled the detection cell to an external magnet. In thepresence of CEA, a sandwich was formed followed by the catalytic reduction of H 2O2. DPV permitted a linear inter- rogation of the CEA level in the range from 10 ng L1to 80 g L1, with a LOD of 1 ng L1. Another sandwich-based platform relied on an anti-CEA antibody and thionine coimmobilized onto the surface of GNPs-encapsulated dendrimer. 562The secondary antibody conjugated with two enzymes, HRP and glucose oxidase, was immobilizedonto the surface of MWCNTs. Notably, the bienzyme utilized to enhance the electrocatalysis. CV and SWV wereused to monitor the electrocatalytic reduction of H 2O2. The linear dynamic range and LOD were determined to be 10 ng L1 to 50 gL1and 4.4 ng L1, respectively. In addition, DNAzyme concatamers were utilized as a signaling tag to develop a sandwich immunoassay for CEA.563 In this work, an anti-CEA antibody was immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode. The DNAzyme concatamer was synthesized by coupling an anti-CEA antibody to GNPs usingbiotin/streptavidin coupling. In addition, two auxiliary DNAstrands were attached to the GNPs to initiate the in situpropagation of the concatamer. Upon addition of hemin, aDNAzme was formed followed by the intercalation of the doublehelix with methylene blue, as shown in Figure 28 . The formed DNAzyme catalyzed the reduction of H 2O2in solution to amplify the redox signal of methylene blue. DPV allowed for a linearquanti cation of CEA in the range from 1 pg L 1to 20 gL1, with a LOD of 0.5 pg L1. A fully automated micro fluidics-based amperometric sensing platform was fabricated using an anti-CEA antibody immobilizedonto the surface of a gold electrode array via cross-linking to a bipodal dithiol chemisorbed on the electrode surface. 564After target recognition, an amperometric signal was generated via theinteraction between a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and amixture of H 2O2and hydroquinone. A LOD of achieved. A fast Fourier transform admittance biosensor for CEA was developed using an anti-CEA antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a gold electrode coated with a bilayer ZnO and GNPs. 565The positively charged HRP enzyme was used to block the active sites of the sensing interface to prevent nonspeci c binding. In the absence of CEA, the enzyme catalyzed thereduction of H 2O2and subsequently the oxidation offerrocyanide to generate a current. In the presence of CEA, the turnover rate of the enzyme was reduced presumably due toblocking the active center of the enzyme, leading to a decrease inthe current signal. Using fast Fourier transform SWV, thereduction current was proportional to CEA level within twoconcentration ranges of 0.1 70 and 70 200gL 1, with a LOD of 10 ng L1. Recently, a volatmmetric sensing platform for CEA was designed using a Mg2+-dependent MNAzyme.566The MNA- zyme assembly was achieved via the simultaneous recognition ofCEA with three DNA-labeled anti-CEA antibodies (via biotin/streptavidin coupling), in the presence of Mg 2+. The formed MNAzyme subsequently cleaved a methylene blue-labeledhairpin probe immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode,causing a decrease in the redox current, as shown in Figure 29 . Using DPV, it was demonstrated that the current suppression was linearly dependent on the logarithm of CEA concentration inthe range from 2 ng L 1to 500 gL1, with a LOD of 1.5 L1. 5.1.3. -Fetoprotein (AFP). AFP is an oncofetal glyco- protein that has been used for the clinical diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, teroblastoma, and liver carcinoma. The level of AFP is 10 ng L1, and it increases during cancer progression.567 A voltammetric immunosensor for AFP was fabricated using an anti-AFP antibody immobilized onto the surface of goldnanowires-functionalized MWCNTs via the interaction of thethiol groups of the cysteine residues in the antibody and the gold Figure 28.

A sandwich-based immunosensor for AFP and CEA was designed using anti-AFP and anti-CEA antibodies coimmobi- lized onto the ed GCE using an L-cysteine chitosan derivative.569The signaling tags were synthesized using platinum nanoparticles ed with thionine and ferrocene- tagged anti-AFP and anti-CEA antibodies, respectively. In addition, the platinum nanoparticles were modi ed with HRP. In the presence of AFP and CEA, electrocatalytic reduction of H2O2was carried out. DPV allowed for the linear quanti cation of AFP and CEA over the ranges 500 ng L1to 50 gL1and 300 ng L1to 45 gL1, with LOD values of 80 and 50 ng L1, respectively. Other sandwich-based immunosensors relied on the electro- catalytic properties of nanoparticles instead of enzymes. For instance, palladium nanoparticles anchored to the surface of carbon decorated iron oxide microspheres were utilized to immobilize the reporter anti-AFP.570Reduction of H 2O2yielded amperometric currents proportional to AFP concentrations in the range from 0.5 ng L1to 10 gL1, with a LOD of 160 pg L1. In another study, patterned gold iridium oxide nanospheres were used for labeling the secondary anti-AFP antibody and water oxidation.571A primary antibody was immobilized onto the gold iridium oxide assemblies preformed on a Prussian blue- functionalized GCE. In the presence of AFP, a sandwich immunoreaction occurred in the presence of p-aminophenol, which became oxidized into p-quinone imine by Prussian blue. The generated p-quinone imine was reduced back to p- aminophenol subsequent to water oxidation. This catalytic recycling reaction ampli ed the DPV currents and allowed for AFP measurements in the linear range from 5 ng L1to 200 g L1, with a LOD of 0.5 ng L1. Also, a dual template-based MIP was utilized as a capture probe to develop a sandwich assay for AFP and CEA.572The MIPwas synthesized by self-polymerization of dopamine on iron oxide nanoparticles, using CEA and AFP as template proteins. The reporter was produced by coimmobilization of anti-AFP or anti-CEA antibody and apoferritin metal (cadmium for AFP, lead for CEA) onto the surface GNPs-modi ed graphene. Subsequent to the sandwich immunoreaction in the presence of AFP or CEA, stripping analysis of the metal component of theimmunocomplex provided a means for quanti cation of the target, as shown in Figure 30 . Using SWV, dynamic measure- ments of AFP and CEA were permissible in the range from 1 ng L 1to 5 gL1, with LOD values of 300 and 350 pg L1, respectively. 5.1.4. Cancer Antigen (CA). A variety of cancer-related antigens are currently being explored for the marker, and its elevated level (>17 kU L 1)i s observed in pancreatic and gastrointestinal malignancies.573 CA125 is a membrane mucin-like glycoprotein, and its elevated level (>35 kU L1) is used for monitoring of epithelial ovarian tumors.574CA15-3, a breast-associated mucin, is often elevated (>25 kU L1) in the majority of breast carcinoma with distant metastases.575CA19-9 is a vital carbohydrate tumor marker.

A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for CA125 was prepared by electropolymerizing a polyphenol lm on the surface of a gold nanoelectrode, in the presence of CA125 as a template.63This was followed by extraction of CA125 using a mixture of aceticacid and sodium dodecyl sulfate. DPV measurements revealedthe linearity of the sensor response in the concentration rangefrom 0.5 to 400 kU L 1, with a LOD of 0.5 kU L1. An electrochemical ELISA for CA125 analysis used an anti- 125 antibody adsorbed onto the wells of a microtiter plate.582 Subsequent to CA125 capture by the immobilized which is electrochemically active. Using amperometry,CA125 was determined within the linear range of 5 1000 kU L 1, with a LOD of 1.3 kU L1. A sandwich-based electrochemical sensor for CA15-3 was designed using an anti-CA15-3 antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a graphene oxide-modi ed ITO electrode.583A mixture of two secondary antibodies conjugated with tyrosinaseand-galactosidase was utilized to amplify the signal via redox cycling. In the presence of CA15-3, phenyl - D-galactopyrano- side was converted into phenol by -galactosidase; phenol was converted into catechol and then o-benzoquinone by tyrosinase; and o-benzoquinone was reduced onto the electrode surface. Chronocouolometric analysis allowed for the detection of CA15-3 concentrations down to 0.1 kU L 1. To overcome the limitations of enzymatic-based assays, a signaling tag was prepared using an anti-CA72-4 antibody conjugated with polyaniline-coated GNPs, which could catalyze the reduction of H 2O2.584The primary antibody was immobilized onto the surface of a nanoporous gold electrode.Using amperometry, quanti cation of CA72-4 was permissible in the range from 2 to 200 kU L 1, with a LOD of 0.1 kU L1. A multiplexed stripping voltammetric immunoassay protocol was designed for simultaneous detection of CA125, CA15-3, andCA19-9 by coimmobilization of the respective antibodies onto the surface of magnetic beads.585The signaling tags were synthesized using the respect ive antibodies labeled with PAMAM dendrimer-metal sul de (ZnS for CA125, CdS for CA15-3, PbS for CA19-9) quantum dots. In the presence of thetarget, a sandwich immunocomplex was formed followed by ASV analysis of the metal components released by acid treatment of the quantum dots. Experimental results indicated that themultiplexed assay enabled the detection of the cancer markers in the range from 0.01 to 50 kU L 1, with a LOD of 0.005 kU L1. 5.1.5. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA). SCCA is a glycoprotein that has been used for the clinical diagnosis ofcervical cancer. Elevated levels of SCCA (>1.5 gL 1) are also associated with other types of cancer with epithelial or endodermal origins, including lung cancer, head and neckcancer, melanomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 586 A sandwich-based voltammetric immunoassay for SCCA was performed in a magnetically controlled micro fluidic device.587 The assay was magnetic mesoporous nanogold/thionine/NiCo 2O4 anti-SCCAantibody conjugated with nanogold/graphene nanosheets as asignaling tag. After sandwich formation in the presence of SCCA,the formed immunocomplex was captured within the micro- fluidic device with the aid of an external magnet. DPV allowed for the linear quanti cation of SCCA in the range from 2.5 ng 15gL1, a LOD 1 ng Enolase (NSE). enzyme enolase, localized predom- in cytoplasm of the neurons. NSE is up-regulatedsubsequent to axon damage to maintain homeostasis. NSE level increases (>12.3 gL 1) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroblastoma.588 A sandwich-based electrochemical sensing platform for NSE was developed using an anti-NSE antibody immobilized onto the surface of nitrogen-doped MWCNTs.589Gold nanoclusters were incorporated into porous calcium carbonate spheres viaelectrostatic interactions, and the formed hybrid material wasfurther utilized to assemble a HRP-conjugated anti-NSE antibody. In the presence of NSE, the enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine by H 2O2. DPV measurements revealed that the current intensity was proportional to the concentration of NSE in the range from 0.5 ng L1to 2gL1, with a LOD of 0.1 Human Epididymis-Speci c Protein 4 (HE4). HE4 is an ovarian biomarker initially identi ed in the epithelium of the distal epididymis and predicted to be a protease inhibitor involved in sperm maturation. Elevated levels of HE4 (>0.6 g L1) are associated with lung cancer and ovarian cancer.590 A sandwich-based electrochemical sensor was adopted for HE4 sensing using rolling cycle ampli cation.591An anti-HE4 antibody was immobilized onto the surface of a tin-doped ITOelectrode precoated with a chitosan/titanium carbide lm. After capture of HE4, a biotinylated anti-HE4 antibody was added followed by streptavidin. Subsequently, the sensor was incubated with biotinylated DNA primers to initiate the rolling cycleamplication, in the presence of a circular DNA template and phi29 DNA polymerase. Doxorubicin hydrochloride intercalated between the rolling cycle ampli cation products, which was subsequently monitored by DPV. This sensor enabledquanti cation of HE4 in the linear range from 75 ng L 1to 7.5 gL1, with a LOD of 1.5 ng L1. Figure 31. Schematic of electrochemical sensor preparation and CA125 analysis.

Ferritin is the oldest known protein involved in iron metabolism. Generally, the range of ferritin in humanserum is 7 158gL 1for is breast cancer, panc reatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin 's lymphoma.593In addition, serum ferritin is elevated during acute and chronic in flammation.594 A MIP-based impedimetric sensing platform for ferritin was polyphenol onthe nanotube array preformed a titanium-coated glass,in the presence of the template ferritin, as shown in Figure 32 . 595 The deposition was self-limiting and yielded a highly conformal nanocoating that is bene cial for low-noise recordings. The impedance change in response to ferritin occurred in the linearconcentration range from 10 pg L 1to 100 ng L1, with a LOD of 10 pg L1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for ferritin was developed antibody, thionine,and bovine serum albumin surface of a screen-printed carbon electrode. 596The signaling tag was synthesized by reverse micelle method using glucose oxidase-doped magneticsilica nanostructures. Subsequently, the nanostructures wereused to label the secondary antibody. A sandwich immunocom-plex was formed in the presence of ferritin followed by theconversion of glucose into gluconolactone by the enzyme label.DPV permitted linear quanti cation of ferritin in the range from 0.1 to 400 gL 1, with a LOD of 10 ng (Ct). linear polypeptide mainly by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Elevated levels of calcitonin (>8.5 gL1) are associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma.597 A sensor for Ct was prepared by grafting 2- acrylylamino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid onto the sur-face of zinc oxide nanostructures followed by Ct-templatedpolymerization on the surface of a vinyl-functionalized PGE. 598 The calibration curve for the DPSV peak current observed versusthe Ct level showed linearity over a concentration range from 9.9 ng L1to 7.9 mg L1, with a LOD L1. 5.1.10. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast in the placenta. Itincreases during pregnancy and abnormal placental invasion. Inaddition, its level is also elevated (>2.2 IU L 1) in germ cell tumors, cancer.599 A sandwich-based voltammetric immunoassay for designed using an anti-hCG antibody immobilized onto thesurface of an array of SWCNTs microelectrodes.600The signaling tag consisted of GNPs coated with the secondary antibody. In the presence of hCG, a sandwich immunocomplex was formed followed by the oxidation of GNPs at a constantpotential of 1.2 V. Using DPV, this sensor permitted the linearinterrogation of hCG level in the range from 0.1 to 20 IU L 1, with a pro-uPA form that binds tothe cell surface and becomes activated to uPA, which regulates the action of other proteases. It also catalyzes the cleavage of plasminogen to are correlated with breast, prostate, ovarian,and squamous cell carcinoma. The normal values of uPA rangebetween and 511 gL 1.601 A voltammetric uPA was constructed using a uPA-speci c aptamer attached to the surface of a gold electrode.602DPV permitted linear quanti cation of uPA in the range from 48.5 ng L1to 48.5 gL1, a LOD of 48.5 for the purpose ofdetoxi cation. GST can be grouped into seven gene-independent classes (alpha, mu, pi, sigma, theta, omega, and zeta) on the basisof the amino acid sequence. The isoform GST-Pi is overex-pressed in cancer cells. Elevated serum GST-pi levels (>3.2 UL 1) were observed in patients various gastrointestinal malignancies, including gastric, esophageal, colonic, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and biliary cancer.603 Using the interaction between GST and ferrocene-labeled glutathione in solution, a voltammetric approach was developedfor GST analysis.604DPV voltammograms displayed a progressive decrease in the ferrocene peak current intensity asthe GST concentration increased, reporting on the bindinginteraction between the electroactive ferrocene-labeled gluta- thione and GST. This sensor successfully detected GST concentrations down to 286 mg L 1. 5.1.13. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). ALP is a hydrolase phosphate groups from manymolecules, including nucleotides, proteins, and alkaloids. As itsname suggests, ALP is more e ective in alkaline environment. The level of ALP rises (>140 U L 1) in leukemia, lymphomas of B cell origin, and osteoblastic bone tumors.605In addition, ALP level increases when renal, intestinal, or placental damage occurs. Also, skeletal diseases such as Paget 's disease, osteomalacia, and fractures may cause an increase in serum ALP level.606 Furthermore, the ALP level increases in liver disorders, such asbile duct obstruction, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and choleocysti-tis. 607 A voltammetric method for detecting ALP activity in droplets was reported.608In this system, the di erence in water and oil solubility between the enzyme 's substrate, ferrocene ethyl phosphate ester, and the product, ferroceneethanol, was utilized for analysis.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAOphosphate ester were placed on a platinum microelectrode and surrounded by a mineral oil. The ester was hydrolyzed intoferroceneethanol, which was partitioned into the mineral oillayer, and the remaining ester was detected by CV to determinethe ALP activity. In addition, a micro fluidic device integrated with comb-type interdigitated ring array electrodes wasfabricated to permit the detection of an array of droplets. 609 The device was successfully applied for the detection of ALPactivity of HeLa cells in single droplets. An amperometric sensing platform for ALP was designed using a synthetic ferrocene-labeled substrate for ALP.610It was proposed that in the presence of ALP, the synthetic substrateferrocenylphenyl phosphate would be dephosphorylated intoferrocenylamine, which would be oxidized at a lower potential than that of the substrate. As a result, ALP activity was monitored ratiometrically due to the ability of the assay to distinguishbetween the substrate and product. Electrochemical analysis wascarried out using a screen-printed carbon electrode, and a LODof 0.4 U L 1was determined. Another substrate, 1-naphthyl phosphate, was utilized for ALP analysis using a screen-printed carbon electrode.611In addition, nanoceria particles were involved in the assay as redox activecatalytic ampli ers of the ALP signal by facilitating the conversion of the enzymatically generated naphthol intonapthoquinone. Using DPV, the ALP activity was determinedwith a LOD of 20 U L 1. An electrochemical sensing platform for ALP used two complementary DNA probes (DNA1 and DNA2) coupled with exonuclease, a 5 -3exonuclease that degrades one DNA strand with a phosphate moiety at the 5 end in the dsDNA.612In this work, ALP dephosphorylated the 5 -phosphoryl-terminated DNA1, which was subsequently hybridized with the DNA2, andattached to a gold electrode surface via a thiol group. The dsDNAformed was cleaved with exonuclease, and DNA1 was released after digestion of the 5 -phosphoryl-terminated DNA2, as shown inFigure 33 . Continuous removal of DNA2 from the electrode surface subsequently reduced the electrochemical signal of theDNA-bound redox probe, (Ru[NH 3]6)3+. Using CC, the ALP level was quanti ed within the linear range from 1 to 20 kU L1, with a LOD of 0.1 kU L1. 5.1.14. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). lactate as as thereverse reaction; NADH/NAD +is used as a cofactor in these reactions. LDH is involved in tumor initiation and metabolism.Thus, LDH is utilized as a general marker in the prognosis of cancer. Elevated levels of LDH (>236 U L 1) are associated with lymphoma, melanoma, acute leukemia, and germ cell tumors. Inaddition, LDH level can be elevated in noncancerous conditionssuch as heart failure, hypothyroidism, meningitis, and liver andlung diseases. 613 An internally calibrated electrochemical continuous enzyme assay was developed for the determination of the enzyme activity.614This assay was performed in a constant-potential amperometric mode in a stirred solution of the enzyme 's substrate. After a baseline current was recorded, aliquots of theproduct (or reactant) of the enzymatic reaction were added tothe solution to calibrate the assay. This was carried out using aGCE modi ed with a CNTs/chitosan hybrid. Subsequently, the assayed enzyme was added to trigger the enzymatic reaction andrecord the current time segment, which was used to calculate the enzyme activity. Using a mixture of sodium pyruvate, NADH,and LDH, this assay enabled the determination of LOD of U L 1.5.1.15. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). VEGF is a signaling protein that regulates both physiologic andpathologic angiogenesis. As its name suggests, VEGF stimulatesvascular endothelial cell growth, survival, and proliferation. 615 The VEGF family in mammals comprises ve members: VEGF- A, VEGF-B, VEGF-D, circulating levels of VEGF (>256 ng L1)616has shown to be of prognostic value in many solid tumors such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma andhematological malignancies such using a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1)immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.618The obtained results revealed a linear response to VEGF concen-trations in the range from 10 to 70 ng L 1. A voltammetric aptasensor for VEGF was designed using a methylene immobilized onto thiol moiety andterminating with label. 53The unique folding motif of the aptamer allowed the sensor to translate the target-induced folding into a signal gain. Using ACV, VEGF wasquanti ed with a LOD of 190 ng L 1. An electrochemical micro fluidic array analyzed four clinically relevant proteins, including VEGF.619In this approach, VEGF was captured o ine using paramagnetic beads modi ed with an anti-VEGF antibody and HRP enzyme. Subsequently, the captured VEGF was introduced into the micro fluidic device, which contained a GNPs-based immunoarray in a microchannelinterfaced with a syringe pump and sample injector. A mixture ofhydroquinone and H 2O2was injected to enhance the signal. Amperometric measurements permitted the interrogation of theVEGF level, with a LOD of 0.8 ng L 1. Figure 33.

Using DPV, the level of VEGFR2 was quanti ed in the linear range from 60.6 ng L1to 13 gL1, with a LOD HER1 is a cell trans-membrane glycoprotein located on the cell surface. Upon binding with its ligands such as the epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor (TGF ), the tyrosine kinase is overexpressed (>75.3 gL1) in many tumors of epithelial origin, such NSCLC, breast, head and neck, gastric, colorectal, esophageal, prostate, renal, bladder, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer.624 A label-free impedimetric sensor for EGFR was fabricated using an anti-EGFR antibody immobilized onto the surface of GNPs-modi ed gold electrode.625Protein G was used as a scaold to allow the proper ori entation of immobilized antibodies. The impedance changes were proportional to EGFR concentrations in the range from 1 ng L1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 0.3 ng L1. An electrochemical aptamer/antibody sandwich-based sens- ing platform for EGFR was developed using EGFR-speci c aptamer immobilized was conjugated to citrate-coated GNPs and used as a signaling probe. In the presence of EGFR, an immunocomplex was formed, and theextent of complexation was determined using DPV. This sensor permitted the linear quanti cation of EGFR in the range from 1 to 40 gL1, with a LOD of 50 ng L1. 5.1.18. Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is a key prognostic marker that is overexpressed in approximately 30% of invasive breast cancers.627It is a particularly important marker because HER2-positive cancers can be treated with targeted therapies. Normal individuals have HER2 levels in the range between 2 and 15 gL1in blood.628 A voltammetric immunosensor for HER2 was fabricated using anti-HER2 antibody attached to iron oxide nanoparticles, which were deposited on a gold electrode surface.629Using DPV, this sensor was shown to be responsive to HER2 concentrations over the linear ranges from 10 ng L1to 10 gL1and 10 gL1to 100gL1, with a LOD of 995 pg L1. Abodies were recently utilized to develop sensing platforms for clinical markers. A bodies are small proteins engineered to bind to a large number of target proteins or peptides with high anity, imitating monoclonal antibodies. For instance, an impedimetric a sensor for HER2 was fabricated using a HER2-speci cabody immobilized onto a GNPs-modi ed screen-printed graphite electrode.630This protein sensor allowed for the linear interrogation of HER2 level up to 40 gL1, with a LOD of 6 gL1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for HER2 was designed using an anti-HER2 onto GNPs, modi ed with 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-1 was conjugated with GNPs modi ed with hydrazine and used as a signaling probe. Following the immunoreaction, the sensor was immersed in a silver nitrate solution. Subsequently, the silver ions were reduced by hydrazine into silver metal and deposited onto the aptamer-GNPs conjugate. Using square wave stripping voltammetry (SWSV), the level of HER2 was determined over the range from 0.1 ng L1to 10 gL1, with a LOD of 37 pg L1. 5.1.19.

Normal individuals have a HER3 concentration in the range between 0.06 and 2.5 gL1in blood.632 An impedimetric immunosensor self-assembled monolayer of 4-aminothiophenol preformed on the surface of a gold electrode.633An anti-HER3 antibody was immobilized onto the electrode surface. The immunosensor exhibited a linear dynamic range of 0.4 2.4 ng L1and a LOD of 0.28 ng is a membrane-associated glycoprotein of the mucin family and represents the major constituent of the mucous layer found in most human epithelia. It serves to lubricate and protects the surface against mechanical, chemical, and biological damage. It is commonly overexpressed in a broad range of di erent malignancies, including breast, lung, gastric, colorectal, bladder, pancreatic, prostate, and ovarian carcinomas.634Normal individuals have a MUC1 concentration in the range between 0.7 and 39.8 kU L1in blood.635 A voltammetric aptasensor was designed for simultaneous determination of two markers, MUC1 and VEGF 165, using a ferrocene-labeled aptamer-complementary DNA hybrid immo- bilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.636The presence of the target forced the complementary strand to dissociate from its complex with the immobilized aptamer, thus bringing the ferrocene group closer to the electrode surface. This was accompanied by an increase in the peak current \"signal-ON \". Using SWV, the peak current increased linearly in the rangesfrom 122.1 gL 1to 2.4 mg L1and 38.2 to 764 gL1, for MUC1 and VEGF 165, respectively. In addition, a MUC1-speci c aptamer was immobilized onto the surface of polypyrrole- modied nanowires within a micro fluidic device.637A signi cant increase in the current was demonstrated in the presence of low concentrations of MUC1 down to 324.8 gL1. Another aptamer-based sensing platform for was developed using a MUC1-speci c hairpin aptamer modi ed with a thiol moiety at one end and biotin label at the other end.638The aptamer was immobilized onto the surface of GNPs, which were further modi ed with a HRP enzyme. After the binding between the aptamer and MUC1, the biotin was exposed and subsequently captured by streptavidin-modi ed MWCNTs preformed on the surface of a GCE, as shown in Figure 34 . The enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine byH2O2into 2,3-diaminophenazine, which became reduced at 0.56 V on the surface of the electrode. DPV results revealed a linear relationship between the peak current and MUC1 concentration in the range from 1.1 to 43.1 mg L1, with a LOD of 268.6 gL1. 5.1.21. Platelet-Derived Growth of three isoforms of PDGF, is a cytokine that plays a signi cant role in vascular proliferation and cell transformation, which is closely related to tumor growth and progression.639The normal serum level of PDGF-BB (8.5 g L1) usually increases sharply in glioma and sarcoma patients.640 An aptamer-based sensing platform for PDGF-BB was constructed using a ferrocene-labeled DNA probe, which contained the aptamer sequence for PDGF-BB and the recognition sequence for EcoR1 endonuclease, immobilizedonto the surface of a gold electrode. 641In the absence of PDGF- BB, the probe folded into a hairpin structure and formed a recognition site for endonuclease. Subsequently, the speci c and cleavable double-stranded region was cleaved and the redox- active ferrocene molecule was removed from the electrodesurface. When bound to the target protein, the probe changed its conguration and the recognition strand was dissociated, resulting in a peak current (signal-ON), as shown in Figure 35 . ACV enabled the interrogation of the PDGF-BB level over the linear range from 20 ng L 1to 200 gL1, with a LOD of 10 ng L1. Another aptamer-based voltammetric sensor for PDGF-BB was designed using rolling circle ampli cation for signal transduction.642First, a PDGF-BB speci ca p t a m e rw a s hybridized with a thiolated complementary DNA strand immobilized onto a gold electrode surface. The electrode was held at 300 mV to accelerate the hybridization process and enhance its e ciency. In the presence of the target, an aptamer- PDGF-BB complex was formed in lieu of the DNA-aptamer complex, resulting in the departure of the aptamer from the electrode surface. The free cDNA was subsequently hybridized with the terminal regions of a padlock probe, generating a circular conguration in the presence of DNA ligase. The rst primer, primer 1, was hybridized with the padlock probe, and extended isothermally by Bst DNA polymerase to generate a multimeric ssDNA, which served as a template for primer 2 binding. Primer 2 was further extended by the polymerase enzyme to displace the Figure 35. Schematic diagram of the principle underlying PDGF-BB detection. In the absence of PDGF-BB, the EcoRI endonuclease cleaved the recognition site of palindrome, resulting in the removal of the redox-active ferrocene from the electrode surface (upper half). On the contrary, the target binding event deformed the EcoRI recognition site and subsequently protected it from endonuclease. As a result, a peak current was observed as shown in the lower half.

Subsequently, methylene blue molecules intercalated into the formed dsDNA. DPV datademonstrated a linear correlation between the DPV current andthe logarithm of PDGF-BB concentration in the range from 123pg L 1to 196.8 ng L1, with a LOD of 39.4 pg L1. In another approach, aptamer-based recognition and rolling cycle ampli cation were also carried out externally, and the amplication products were subsequently deposited onto the electrode surface prior to hybridization and methylene blueintercalation.643Using ACV, this assay o ered a linear response to the target over a concentration range from 2.1 to 206.6 gL1, with a LOD of PDGF-BB ricated using anti-PDGF-BB antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a gold electrode.644PDGF-BB was subsequently sandwiched between the primary antibody and a secondaryantibody immobilized onto the surface of graphene oxide. Theelectrode was then immersed into a silver enhancer solutioncontaining silver ions and hydroquinone. Experimental resultsrevealed that the SWV response of the immunosensor wasproportional to the logarithm of PDGF-BB concentration in therange from 10 ng L 1to 100 gL1, with L1. A sandwich-based immobilized onto the electrode surface. The signaling tag was prepared bycoimmobilizing a thiol-terminated PDGF-BB speci c aptamer 2 and ferrocenehexanethiol onto the surface of GNPs. DPVmeasurements were carried out in the presence of PDGF-BB andpermitted its linear quanti cation in the range from 24.6 ng L 1 to 246 gL1, with a LOD of 7.4 ng L1. Another sandwich-based electrochemical aptasensor for PDGF-BB was designed using a PDGF-BB speci c aptamer immobilized onto the surface of GNPs-modi ed screen-printed carbon electrode.646Silver nanoparticles were used as signaling through modi cation with a PDGF-BB speci c aptamer and hybrid (hybrid-A and hybrid-B). Silver aggregates wereformed on the electrode through the in situ hybridization of theaptamer/hybrid-A and aptamer/hybrid-B, which were detected by DPSV after peroxidation, as shown in Figure 36 . This approach facilitated the linear analysis of PDGF-BB in the rangefrom 5 ng L 1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 1.6 ng L1. 5.1.22. Nuclear Matrix Protein 22 (NMP22). NMP22 is a tumor marker for bladder cancer. The level of NMP22 in healthyindividuals is less than 10 kU L 1, and it increases among 80% of bladder cancer patients.647 A voltammetric immunosensor trimetallic Au/Pt/Pd nanoparticles.648Subsequently, antibody was anchored to the surface of thenanoparticles. It was demonstrated that the trimetallic nano-particles could accelerate the electron transfer and enhance thesignal response by the synergistic e ect of the three di erent metals. The immunosensor exhibited a wide linear dynamicrange (0.04 20 kU L 1) and a low LOD of 0.01 kU L1. An amperometric immunosensor for NMP22 was constructed using Au Pt bimetallic nanostructures, which were prepared by dealloying a commercial Au/Ag alloy into nanoporous gold.649 After deposition of the nanoporous gold onto the surface ofGCE, Pt nanoparticles were deposited on top of the surface ofnanoporous gold by bottom-up electrodeposition. An anti-MMP22 antibody was subsequently immobilized onto thesurface of the Au Pt nanostructures. In the presence of MMP22, it was observed that the electrocatalytic reduction ofH 2O2was diminished as a result of its blocked access to the Au Pt nanostructures. Using amperometry, a linear range from 10 ng L1to that is transiently expressed during fetal develop-ment and is absent or greatly reduced in most adult tissues.However, TN-C is overexpressed (>13.6 gL 1) in many solid tumors, such as brain, lung, breast, pancreatic, colon, liver,kidney, bladder, skin, bone, prostate, ovarian, and soft tissuecancer. 650 A competitive impedimetric assay for TN-C was developed using an anti-TN-C antibody immobilized onto the surface of anarray of gold electrodes.651TN-C was captured by the immobilized antibody, and the nonoccupied binding sites wereidentied using a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody speci o the cantly increased the interfacial resistance. This antibody-based assay had a LOD of 7 mg L 1. 5.1.24. p53 Tumor Suppressor Protein (p53). p53 is a potent transcription factor that plays an important role incontrolling cellular responses to stress factors such as ionizingradiation and UV induction. Loss of p53 function results intumor formation and gene mutation, which is caused by theconformational changes in p53 protein structure. 652It was observed that the expression of p53 protein phosphorylated atserine 20 (p53(20)) and 653In addition, p53(392) may regulate the oncogenic function of mutant forms of p53 protein in breastcancer. The typical mean value of p53 protein in the serum is 150ng L 1.654 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for p53(392) was constructed using an anti-p53(392) antibody immobilized onto the surface of a GNPs-modi ed screen-printed carbon electrode.655The signaling tag was produced using graphene oxide functionalized with an anti-p53(392) antibody and HRPenzyme. After a sandwich imm unoreaction, the captured signaling tag produced an ampli ed electrocatalytic response through the reduction of enzymatically oxidized thionine in thepresence of H 2O2. Using SWV, the level of p53(392) was linearly Figure 36.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXASquanti ed in the range from 1.1 to 106 gL1, with a LOD of 0.5 gL1. To further enhance the sensitivity and reduce the analysis time, gold nanorods were used instead of GNPs and a positivedriving potential (+0.4 V for 3 min) was applied to accelerate thetransport of negatively charged analytes, including p53(392),p53(15), p53(46), and p53. 656In addition, a negatively charged potential of 0.2 V was applied for 1.5 min to accelerate the binding of the signaling tag to the captured analyte. SWV measurements allowed for the linear analyses of p53(392),p53(15), p53(46), and p53 ranging from 0.5 gL 1to 1.1 mg L1, 2.7gL1to 1.1 mg L1, 5.3gL1to 2.7 mg L1, and 2.7 g L1to 1.1 mg L1, with LOD values of 0.3, 1.1, 1.6, and 0.5 g L1, respectively. A biofuel-cell-based self-powered biosensor for p53 was reported, in which bilirubin oxidase/DNA-modi ed graphene/ platinum nanoparticles hybrid nanosheet worked as a biocathodeto control the capture of p53, and thus tune the electron transferprocess of O 2reduction for signal ampli cation.657It was observed that the strong interaction between p53 and itsconsensus DNA sequence on the electrode surface could blockthe electron transfer from bilirubin oxidase to the electrode, thusreducing the electrocatalytic activity of O 2reduction at the biocathode. In combination with glucose oxidation at the CNTs/Meldola 's blue/glucose dehydrogenase bioanode, a current or power decrease of the biofuel cell was observed in the presence of p53. The designed BFC-based sensor showed a wide linear range extending from 53 ng L 1to 53 mg L1, with a LOD of 53 ng L1. 5.1.25. Fibrinogen (Fib). Fib is a glycoprotein produced by the liver and plays a key role in the hemostatic system. Normallevels of Fib in human plasma lie within the range between 1.5and 4.5 g L 1.658Plasma levels of Fib can be used as a biomarker for gastric and ovarian cancer.659The determination of Fib and its degradation products has also a great value in the detection of bladder cancer.660Fib is also an important determinant of the metastatic potential of circulating tumor cells.661In addition, elevated Fib levels are associated with cardiovascular diseases662 and in flammatory diseases such as periodontal disease.663 A sandwich immunosensing platform for Fib was constructed using an anti-Fib antibody immobilized onto the surface of a carbon nanohorns-modi ed screen-printed carbon electrode.664 After Fib capture, a HRP-conjugated anti-Fib antibody was added, thionine byH 2O2. a linear relation- ship between the amperometric current and Fib concentration inthe range from 0.1 to 100 mg L 1, with a LOD of 58 gL1. Two competitive electrochemical assays exist for the sensing of Fib.665In the direct competitive format, Fib-speci c nanobodies were immobilized onto magnetic beads attached to the surface ofa screen-printed carbon electrode positioned on top of a magnet.The target Fib competed with biotin-labeled Fib for binding toimmobilized nanobodies. In the indirect competitive format, Fibwas immobilized onto the surface of the magnetic beads.Subsequently, the target Fib competed with immobilized Fib forbinding to biotin-labeled nanobodies. In both assays, astreptavidin-labeled HRP enzyme byaddition of a mixture of H 2O2and hydroquinone. Remarkably, better analytical performance was achieved using the indirect competitive immunoassay with a LOD of 44 gL1. 5.1.26. Cluster of Di erentiation 146 Antigen (CD146). CD146 is a cell adhesion molecule that belongs to theimmunoglobulin superfamily. It was originally identi ed as a melanoma and breast cancer progression marker,666,667and later recognized as an endothelial marker.668Previous studiesdemonstrated that endothelial CD146 is involved in especially tumor angiogenesis.669The normal serum level of CD146 in healthy individuals is 309 gL1.670 A sandwich-based amperometric sensor for CD146 was constructed using an anti-CD156 antibody immobilized onto the surface of a reduced graphene oxide-tetraethylene pentam- ine-modi ed GCE.671This surface modi cation provided a large number of amino groups to enhance the loading capacity ofantibodies. The secondary antibody was modi ed with TiO 2 colloidal sphere laden Au/Pd nanoparticles, to permit the electrocatalytic reduction of H 2O2. This approach allowed for the linear quanti cation of CD146 in the range from 5 ng L1to 20 gL1, with a LOD of 1.6 ng 5.1.27. Cluster of Di erentiation 105 Antigen (CD105). CD105, a receptor for transforming growth factor (TGF) 1 and 3 in vascular endothelial cells, is highly upregulated (>0.9 g L1) in patients a ected with colorectal cancer and metastatic breast cancer.672,673 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor was fabricated using an anti-CD105 antibody immobilized onto the surface of a GNPs- modied gold electrode.674The signaling tag was prepared by immobilizing a thionine acetate-modi ed anti-CD105 antibody onto platinum nanoparticles. CV permitted a linear interrogation of the CD105 level in the range from 1.3 to 200 gL1, with a LOD of 0.9 gL1. 5.1.28. Estrogen Receptor (ER). ER, a ligand-dependent transcription factor, is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.675The biological e ects of ER are mediated by its binding to estrogen. Emerging ndings suggest that elevated levels of ER (>0.6 g/g cytosol protein) can be used for the diagnosis of breast cancer.676 An exonuclease III protection-based voltammetric assay for ER was designed using a DNA duplex, incorporating an ER- specic sequence, immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.677The second strand was labeled with methylene blue at the proximal end. The presence of ER protected the duplex DNA molecules from exonuclease III digestion, resulting in anelectrochemical signal. Experimental results revealed the abilityof SWV to quantify ER in the range from 33.1 gL 1to 6.6 mg L1, with a LOD of 5.1.29. Interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine that has a key role in the in flammatory response, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of in flammatory conditions, such as arthritis, psoriasis, and in flammatory bowel diseases.678 High levels of IL-6 have also been correlated with prostate, breast, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.679The normal values of IL-6 in a healthy individual range between 10and 75 ng L 1.680 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for IL-6 was constructed using a magnetic beads-labeled anti-IL-6 antibody captured within the wells of a microtiter plate positioned on topof a magnet. 681Silver nanoparticle-titanium phosphate spheres (AgNP-TiP) were synthesized and used to label the secondary antibody. In the presence of IL-6, an immunocomplex wasformed, and the silver ions were subsequently released using HNO 3. DPV permitted the interrogation of IL-6 level in the linear range from 0.5 ng L1to 10 gL1, with a LOD of 0.1 ng L1. In a related approach, a signaling tag comprising the secondary antibody and poly-HRP-streptavidin conjugate was utilized.682The immunoreaction was monitored amperometri- cally after of a mixture of hydroquinone and H2O2.A linear calibration plot was achieved between the measuredChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXATsteady-state current and the logarithm of IL-6 concentration in the range from 1.8 to 500 ng L1, with a LOD of 0.4 ng L1. Another sandwich-based amperometric assay was developed using an array of 8 gold compact discs integrated into amicrofluidic device to reduce the sample volume.683The capture anti-IL-6 antibody was immobilized onto the surface of the goldelectrodes. After incubation with IL-6, a biotinylated detectionantibody was added followed by streptavidin-labeled HRPenzyme. A mixture of hydroquinone and H 2O2was then injected into the micro fluidic device to generate the amperometric response. This sensing system exhibited a linear response towardthe logarithm of IL-6 concentration in the range from 10 pg L 1 to 1.3 ng L1, with a LOD of 10 pg L1. Also, a boron nitride gold nanocluster composite was synthesized and used to label thesecondary antibody.684After immunocomplex formation, SWV permitted the linear quanti in the range from 5 ng L1to 100 gL1, with a LOD of 5.1.30. Interleukin 8 (IL-8). IL-8 or CXCL8 is an important mediator of host response to injury and in flammation. It possesses diverse functions as neutrophil activator and chemo-tactant for neutrophils, T cells, and suggest that elevated levels of IL-8 (>13 ng L1) can be used for the diagnosis of NSCLC, breast, and ovarian cancers.686 A sandwich-based amperometric sensing platform was constructed for the simultaneous detection of IL-8 and PSA,using a primary antibody immobilized onto the surface of adisposable 16-channel screen-printed carbon electrode. 540The signaling tag was fabricated by loading the secondary antibodyand HRP enzyme onto the surface of MWCNTs. Usingamperometry, this approach sensor facilitated measurements ofIL-8 and PSA within the linear ranges of 8 1000 and 5 4000 ng L 1, with LOD values of 8 and 5 ng L1, respectively. 5.1.31. Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). MMP-9 is a gelatinase subgroup of the matrix metalloproteinases thatdegrades type IV collagen, the main material in the basementmembrane, thus helping to separate the epithelial cells from theunderlying stroma. 687Increased expression of MMP-9 in tumors lead to the degradation of the basement membranes, a criticalstep in tumor invasion.688Elevation of the serum level of MMP-9 (>189 gL1) has been observed in NSCLC and breast cancer patients.689 A peptide-based MMP-9 speci c peptide, which was designed to contain a terminal cysteine for assembly on a goldelectrode.690The sensing electrode was packaged in poly- ethylene glycol hydrogel and integrated with a micro fluidic device. The MMP-9 cleaved the redox-labeled peptides andcaused a in the signal. SWV allowed forthe quanti cation of the MMP-9 level, with a LOD of 5.5 pg L 1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensing platform for MMP-9 was constructed using an anti-MMP-9 antibody immobilizedonto the surface of a screen-printed electrode.691Polystyrene spheres/poly- to label thesecondary antibody. After immunocomplex formation, SWVwas employed to determine the level of MMP-9 in the linearrange from 10 to 1000 pg L 1, with a LOD of 5 pg L1. 5.1.32. Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor (p16INK4a). p16INK4ais a tumor suppressor protein that is implicated in the prevention of cancer. It is currently used as a biomarker forcervical cancer and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.692 sensor for p16INK4awas developed using an anti-p16 antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a CNTs-modi ed screen-printed carbon electrode.693 The signaling tag consisted of GNPs coated with the secondary antibody. In the presence of glutathione- S-transferase-p16 recombinant protein, sandwich immnoreaction occurred fol-lowed by the deposition of metallic silver on the surface of GNPs.LSV enabled a linear quanti cation of p16 in the range from 15.6 gL 1to 0.3 mg L1, with a LOD of 1.3 gL1. 5.1.33. Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2). MDM2 is a protein, encoded by the MDM2 gene, which acts as a negative regulator for the p53 tumor suppressor. MDM2 is overexpressedin a wide variety of tumors, such as breast and lung cancer, germcell tumors, sarcomas, lymphomas, MDM2 was constructed using an anti-MDM2 antibody immobilized onto the surface of acysteamine-modi ed gold electrode, using 1,4-phenylene diisothiocyanate as a linker.695This approach enabled a linear quanti cation of MDM2 in the range from 1 ng L1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 0.3 ng L1. 5.1.34. Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF- B).NF-Bi sa protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA, cytokineproduction, and cell survival. Defects in NF- B production result in increased susceptibility to apoptosis, leading to cell deathbecause it regulates the antiapoptotic genes. The level of NF- B has been shown to increase in estrogen receptor negative (ER ) breast and lung cancer patients. 696 A voltammetric nucleic acid-based sensing platform for NF- constructed using dsDNA containing a protein-binding sitefor NF- B that was self-assembled onto a GCE.697In the absence of the target, the dsDNA probe was digested with exonuclease III.In the presence of NF- B, it could bind to the probe and hinder its digestion with exonuclease III. An acridone derivative, 10-methyl-3-nitro-acridone, was bound via intercalation to thedsDNA, leading to an electrochemical signal. A small signal wasobserved in the absence of the target due to the weak bindinganity of the redox mediator to ssDNAs. Using SWV, the NF- B level was linearly determined in the range from 10 to 50 gL 1, with a LOD of 2 gL1. 5.1.35. Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1 (APE1). APE1 is a multifunctional protein in the DNA base excision/repair pathway. Many studies have demonstrated high APE1levels in various types of cancer, such as NSCLC, breast, thyroid,pancreatic, colorectal, cervical, and ovarian cancer, suggesting aprognostic relevance APE1 as a tumor marker. 698 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for APE1 featured an anti-APE1 immobilized gold nanochains-modied GCE, precoated with decorated graphene nanosheets linker. Alkaline phosphatase and ferrocene-tagged anti-APE1 antibody were loaded onto the nanocarriersand used as a signaling tag. A sandwich immunocomplex wasformed in the presence of APE1 and CV was subsequentlyutilized for the linear determination of the target in the rangefrom 0.1 to 80 ng L 1, with a LOD of 40 pg L1. In a related approach, the alkaline phosphatase enzyme was utilized toconvert ascorbic acid 2-phosphate into ascorbic acid, which was further oxidized electrochemically to amplify the signal.700DPV measurements revealed a linear correlation between the currentsignal and APE1 level in the range from 10 pg L 1to 100 ng L1, with a LOD of 3.9 pg L1. 5.1.36. Breast Cancer Type 1 and 2 Susceptibility Proteins (BRCA1 and BRCA2). BRCA1 and BRCA2 are antioncogenes in are genetically predisposed toChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAUbreast cancer. It is normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissues, where they ar e involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with a key role in the error-free repair ofDNA double helix breaks. Malfunction of BRCA1 and BRCA2,due to mutation of the corresponding gene, increases the risk ofbreast cancer. 701 A sandwich-based amperometric sensor for BRCA1 was explored using an anti-BRCA1 antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a GCE modi ed with thionine and polyvinylpyrroli- done-protected graphene.702The secondary antibody was anchored to the surface of SBA-15, one of mesoporous silicaswith uniform tubular channels. In addition, an HRP enzyme wasentrapped in the pores of the SBA-15. The signaling tag wassubsequently treated with the ionic liquid, BMIM \u00b7BF 4,t o enhance the electrochemical activity of the enzyme and promote electron transport. Subsequent to BRCA1 capture, the sensorwas incubated with H 2O2. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range extending from 10 ng L1to 15 gL1, with a LOD of 4.9 ng L1. 5.1.37. Telomerase. As a ribonucleoprotein complex containing both an essential RNA template and a protein reverse transcriptase unit, telomerase can add the telomere repeating units (TTAGGG)nto the 3 end of chromosomal DNA using its endogenous RNA template.703Telomeres cap and protect the eukaryotic chromosomal ends from undesired degradation,recombination, or end-to-end fusion. Indeed, in over 85% ofdierent cancer types, elevated levels of telomerase are detected. 704This renders the enzyme an important therapeutic target and a valuable marker for malignancy and tumorprogression.705Although the telomeric repeat ampli cation protocol (TRAP) has been used as a powerful method formonitoring telomerase activity,706,707its use has been limited because it is susceptible to PCR-derived artifacts.708Several electrochemical sensing formats were developed to replace the traditional TRAP assay. An electrochemical method based on CC coupled with hexamineruthenium chloride was proposed as a simple and rapidassay of telomerase activity.709Briefly, a telomerase primer was immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode, and the primerwas extended by the telomerase extract obtained from of 5 1000 HeLa cells. Subsequently, the amount of [Ru(NH 3)6]3+ electrostatically bound to the growing DNA increased, resultingin a higher electrochemical signal. In a closely related approach,ferrocenylnaphthalene diimide was utilized instead of hexami-neruthenium thetelomerase activity. 710Using SWV, the activity was detectable in 10 Ca9-22 cells. An impedimetric sensing platform was designed on the basis of the ability of the elongated DNA to block the transfer of [Fe(CN)6]3/[Fe(CN)6]4electrons to the electrode surface, resulting in an increase in the impedance.711It was found that the impedance has a linear dependence on the logarithm of thenumber of HeLa cells in the range of 10 3105cells. A FET-based sensor was fabricated using a telomerase primer immobilized onto the Al 2O3gate surface of an ion-sensitive FET (ISFET).712The telomerase-induced extension of the telomer- ase primer altered the gate potential and allowed for thedetection of telomerase extracted from 65 \u00b110 293T (transformed human embryonic kidney) cell L 1. A voltammetric sensing platform for telomerase activity was recently reported using a telomerase primer immobilized ontothe surface of a gold electrode.713The primer was extended by telomerase in cell extracts to form telomeric repeats, which weresubsequently hybridized with spherical nucleic acids on the surface of GNPs. Thereafter, two hairpin probes were hybridizedwith the unoccupied spherical nucleic acids to initiate a cascadeof hybridization events forming a double-helix, as shown After incubation with hexamineruthenium chloride, the telomerase activity was detected by DPV from as low as 2HeLa cells. A homogeneous electrochemical strategy for telomerase activity analysis was recently adopted based on a TS-primer,methylene blue-labeled hairpin DNA probe, and T7 exonu-clease. 714In the absence of telomerase, the DNA probe remained in the hairpin conformation and gave a weak electrochemicalsignal due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negativelycharged ITO electrode and hairpin probe. In the presence oftelomerase, elongation of the TS-primer took place and theextended telomeric repeats hybridized with the DNA probeforming a duplex strand. The formed duplex was subsequentlydigested by the T7 exonuclease, leading to the accumulation ofthe blue-labeled mononucleotides, which have higherdiusivity toward the ITO electrode due to their smaller size and less negative charge. It was observed that the DPV peak currentwas linearly dependent on the logarithm of the number of HeLacells over the range of 2 200 cells, with a LOD of 1 cell. 5.1.38.

CV and SWV allowed for the detection of 1 mg L 1of each kinase. The role of the linker in ferrocene-ATP conjugate was by testing linkers withdierent number of optimal analytical response ferrocene-ATP conjugates contain-ing more than six CH 2groups. In an attempt to improve the assay sensitivity, analysis of Src kinase was performed using a gold array chip, which resulted in LOD values of 0.1 mg L1and 50 ng L1, respectively.728 A homogeneous voltammetric assay for PKA was designed using a synthetic receptor immobilized onto the surface of a goldelectrode.729Subsequently, PKA phosphorylated a ferrocene- labeled PKA-speci c peptide, and the reaction solution was introduced into the modi ed electrode surface. The enzymatic product, bound to the surface through the binuclear Zn2+ complex, generated an electrochemical signal. Using DPV, theLOD of PKA was estimated to be 0.1 kU L 1with a relatively linear increase from 5 to 50 kU L1.A label-free voltammetric sensor for PKA was constructed using a PKA-speci c peptide immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.730The substrate peptide formed a compact positively charged lm on the electrode surface, and thus it blocked the positively charged [Ru(NH3)6]3+probe from reaching the electrode. After the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of the immobilized peptide, the electrochemical probe becameelectrostatically attracted to the electrode surface, resulting in anelectrochemical signal. DPV enabled the quanti cation of PKA activity in the linear range from 0.1 to 10 U L 1, with a LOD of 0.1 U L1. Another voltammetric sensing platform for CK2 was fabricated using a CK2-speci c peptide immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.731In the absence of CK2, the peptide was digested with carboxypeptidase Y, resulting in a lowinterfacial resistance to the electron transfer from [Fe- (CN) 6]3/[Fe(CN)6]4. In the presence of CK2, the peptide was phosphorylated and subsequently resisted digestion by carboxypeptidase Y, resulting in a small redox current. UsingDPV, the CK2 activity was determined with a LOD of 47 U L 1. An amperometric sensor for PKA was fabricated using a PKA- specic peptide immobilized onto the surface phosphorylation catalyzed by coordination interactions. The electrocatalytic reduction ofH 2O2c a u s e db yt h ei m m o b i l i z e df e r r i ci o n sl e dt ot h e amplication of the electrochemical signal of ferric ions and provided a higher sensitivity for PKA detection. The method enabled the analysis of PKA with a LOD of 3 kU L1. Figure 38. Schematic representation of a method for detection of M.SssI MTase activity. Reprinted with permission from ref 743.

Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAXAn electrochemical strategy for PKA analysis was adopted on the basis Zr4+-mediated signal transduction and rolling cycle amplication.733First, the substrate peptide immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode was phosphorylated by PKA. Then, Zr4+linked the phosphorylated peptide and DNA primer probe through interaction with the phosphate groups. After the introduction of the padlock probe and phi29 DNA polymerase, rolling cycle ampli cation was initiated on the electrode surface. The long DNA strand adsorbed a large number of the electrochemical species, [Ru(NH 3)6]3+, leading to an electro- chemical signal. CC enabled the analysis of PKA activity in the linear range from 5 to 500 kU L1, with a LOD of 0.5 kU L1.I n an alternative approach, the DNA primer attached to the phosphorylated peptide was hybridized with DNA-coated GNPs to form a polymeric network.734The kinase activity was determined by the amperometric response of [Ru(NH3)6]3+, adsorbed on the polymeric block by electrostatic interaction. The proposed sensor presented a low LOD of 30 U L1for PKA activity and a linear range extending from 30 U L1to 40 kU L1. 5.1.39. DNA Methyltransferase (DNA-MTase). DNA- MTase is an enzyme methyl group transfer from the donor S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM) to the target and methy- lated DNA.735Methylation in higher eukaryotic cells has frequently been observed at carbon 5 position of cytosine (C) in the 5 -CG-3 sequence (CpG).736,737Overexpression of DNA- MTase has been found in many cancers, such as thyroid,738 colon,739lung,740prostate,741and breast cancer.742 A voltammetric sensing platform for DNA-MTase activity was reported that used a DNA double helix assembled onto the surface of GNPs-modi ed GCE.743The DNA was rst methylated by M.SssI MTase and then digested by restriction endonuclease Hpall, which could not recognize the methylated CpG site. Subsequently, anti-5-methylcytosine was attached to the CpG methylation site, and the antibody was attached to a HRP-labeled anti-IgG, as shown in Figure 38 . After incubation with a mixture of hydroquinone and H2O2, DPV was utilized for the determination of DNA-MTase activity in the linear range from 0.5 to 50 kU L1, with a LOD of 0.1 kU L1. In a closely related approach, the labeled antibody step was replaced by incubation catalyzed electrooxidation of ascorbic acid. CV measurement revealed alinear correlation between the catalytic oxidation current of ascorbic and M.SssI MTase activity ranging from 0 to 120 kUL 1. An alternative assay relied on using a dsDNA probe modi ed at the 3 was employed to determine the M.SssI activity in the linear rangefrom 0.1 to 450 kU L 1, with a LOD of 0.05 kU L1. A voltammetric sensor for DNA MTase activity was fabricated using a methylene blue-labeled dsDNA immobilized onto thesurface of an ITO presence of methylation (Dam) methyltransferase DNA I triggered an Subsequently, methylene blue-labeled mononucleotides were released. Exper-imental results showed a linear correlation between the DPVpeak current and the logarithm of Dam MTase concentrationranging from 4 U L 1to 4 kU L1, with a LOD of 4 U L1.I n another approach, the dsDNA probe was labeled with CdSe/ZnSquantum dots. 747After treatment with HNO 3, SWASV was employed to determine the Dam MTase activity within the rangefrom 1 to 128 kU L 1, with a LOD of 0.8 kU L1. There are other important tumor markers, such as progesterone receptor (PR),676prostatic acid phosphatase protein (BJP),757cytokeratin fragments 21-1,758NY-BR-1,759and survivin.760To date, these markers have not been targets of electrochemical biosensors. A summaryof the cancer markers is provided in Table 2 . 5.2. Cardiac Markers 5.2.1. Troponin I (cTnI). cTnI has been recognized as the \"gold standard \"cardiac marker for diagnosis of myocardial infarction.761It is a cardiac muscle regulatory protein located on the actin lament of normal monocyte. cTnI is released into the bloodstream upon injury to cardiac muscles (e.g., myocardial infarction). The normal level of cTnI in serum is 0.4 gL1.762 A peptide-based impedimetric sensor for cTnI was con- structed using a small peptide, previously identi ed from a polyvalent phage displayed library, immobilized onto the surfaceof a gold electrode. 763An increase in the charge-transferTable 2. continued tumor marker cancers associated with elevated levels normal values chromogranin A (CgA)750neuroendocrine, neuroblastoma, antigen (CD20)755non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma NA bladder tumor antigen (BTA)756bladder, kidney NA protein multiple myeloma, colorectal, melanoma NAChemical Reviews Review DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00220 Chem. Rev. XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAYresistance was observed with increasing cTnI concentrations up to 10 mg L1, with a LOD of 0.3 mg L1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for cTnI was reported, in which the secondary antibody was modi ed with CdTe quantum dots and the primary antibody was immobilized ontothe surface of a GNPs/poly(dimethoxysilane) composite withina micro fluidic device. 90Subsequent to the immunoreaction, the quantum dots were dissolved in HNO 3and the metal ions were released and detected using SWASV. The reported assay allowedfor the determination of cTnI level within the linear from10 ng L 1to 50 gL1. Another sandwich-based voltammetric sensing platform was reported in which an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was utilized.764Among several phosphatase substrates and products tested, L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate and ascorbic acid have met the requirements for obtaining a high signal-to- background ratio. Using CV, the LOD of the immunosensor was 100 and 10 pg L1without and with redox cycling of ascorbic acid with TCEP, respectively. In a sandwich-based lateral- flow immunoassay format, of 4-amino-1-naphthyl -D-galactopyr- anoside (substrate), wasutilized for fast and selective electrochemical-chemical-chemical(ECC) redox cycling of the enzyme product in the presence of[Ru(NH 3)6]3+and TCEP, as shown Figure 39 .765A 0.1 ng L1for cTnI was obtained after serum dropping without the use of any additional solutions. 5.2.2. Troponin T (cTnT). cTnT is a part of the troponin complex. It binds to tropomyosin and helps in its positioning on actin, with the rest of the troponin complex modulating the contraction of striated muscl es. During acute myocardial infarction, cTnT is immediately released into the blood-stream.766The normal value of cTnT in blood is less than 10 gL1.767 A voltammetric immunosensor for cTnT was built on the basis of a GCE modi ed with liquid crystal used to an cTnT antibody through electrostatic interactions. Using SWV,analysis of cTnT was permissible in the linear range from 0.1 to0.9gL 1, with a LOD of 76 ng L1. In another approach, the GCE electrode was modi ed with employed as a redox probe.769Using SWV, the current signal was proportional to cTnT concentration in the range of 0.2 1gL1, with a LOD of 0.1 gL1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensing platform was constructed using a biotinylated anti-cTnT immobi- lized onto the ed with streptavidin polystyrene microspheres.770The target analyte was sandwiched between the immobilized antibody and a HRP- conjugated secondary antibody. The prosthetic group in the enzyme molecule became oxidized (Fe3+Fe5+) in the presence of H 2O2, and its redox center was successively regenerated by the electron donor, tetracyanoquinodimethane, generating a catho- dic peak through silver reduction. CV measurements exhibited a linear response to cTnT concentrations in the range between 0.1and 10 gL 1. Another sandwich-based electrochemical assay was developed using a cyclo-ole n polymer micro fluidic device with integrated channel gold microband electrodes and a capture zone in whichfunctionalized magnetic particles are captured. 771Subsequent to loading cTnT into the device, a sandwich immunocomplex was formed between cTnT, HRP-conjugated anti-cTnT antibody,and magnetic beads-labeled antibody. CA enzymatic reduction of H 2O2, mediated by TMB, permitted the quanti cation of cTnT level in the linear range from 50 ng L1to 1 10 gL1, with a LOD of 17 ng L1. 5.2.3. Myoglobin (Mb). Mb is a heme-containing protein found in all muscle cells, including smooth, skeletal, and cardiac cells. Because of its small size (17.8 kDa), Mb is quickly released into the bloodstream (as early as 1 3 h) upon muscle injury, and thus it acts as a valuable marker for acute myocardial infarction.772The normal Mb level in human blood ranges between 6 and 85 gL1.772 A voltammetric aptasensor for Mb was constructed using a Mb-speci c aptamer immobilized onto the surface of a oxide/CNTs-functio nalized screen-printed elec- trode.773Mb contains the heme group an active site where heme-iron is in its oxidation state (Fe3+), which can be reduced directly at the electrode surface to its ferrous state (Fe2+). Using CV, a linear interrogation of the Mb level was obtained in the range between 1 gL1and 4 mg L1, with a LOD of 34 ng L1. Another aptasensing platform for Mb was based on a gold electrode modi ed with a hybrid of a thiolated capture DNA probe and Mb-speci c aptamer.774In the absence of Mb, a supersandwich was formed on the electrode surface afterintroduction of two reporter DNAs, DNA 1 and DNA 2. In the presence of Mb, the aptamer was displaced from the electrode surface, resulting in a reduction of the amount ofRuHex on the electrode and subsequently lowered electro-chemical signal. Using CC, the Mb level was measured down to 167 ng L 1. Figure 39.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXAZA peptide-based voltammetric sensor for Mb was fabricated using a Mb-speci c peptide (CPSTLGASC), identi ed by phage display and immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.775 CV measurements permitted the quanti cation of Mb level in the linear range from 17.8 gL1to 1.8 mg L1, with a LOD of 9.8 g L1. A MIP-based sensing platform for Mb was constructed by copolymerizing acrylamide, N,N-methylenebis(acrylamide), 2- acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt, and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride on the surface of ascreen-printed gold electrode in the presence of Mb, as atemplate. 776This MIP-based sensor displayed linear responses to Mb in EIS and SWV measurements with LOD values of 1.5 and0.3 mg L 1, respectively. An impedimetric immunosensor for Mb was fabricated using an anti-Mb antibody immobilized onto the surface of an ITOelectrode modi ed with a hybrid lm of ZnS nanocrystals decorated reduced graphene oxide.777A linear EIS response to Mb was obtained in the range from 10 gL1to 1 mg L1. A single polyaniline nanowire-based conductometric immu- nosensor was produced using an anti-Mb antibody immobilizedonto the surface of single nanowires formed between a pair ofpatterned electrodes. 778The conductance change was directly proportional to Mb concentration in the linear range from 5 g L1to 2.5 mg L1, with a LOD of 1.4 gL1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for Mb was based on an immunoreaction between a magnetic beads-labeled primary antibody, Mb, and silver nanopa rticles-labeled secondary antibody.779The magnetic beads enabled Mb captured from a test sample to be deposited on the surface of a screen-printedcarbon electrode. Silver nan oparticles were dissolved by oxidation on the electrode surface into silver ions followed byreduction into silver metal to accumulate on the electrode surfaceandnally oxidation to give a quanti able stripping charge within the dynamic range spanning 1. roles in the natriuretic, diuretic, and vasodilatorsystems, as well as in the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous system. 780Its level in the blood re flects ventricular volume expansion and ventricular overload, and thus it is used for diagnosis of congestive heartfailure and prognosis of heart failure.781Moreover, an elevated level of NT-proBNP (>200 300 ng L1) is also a useful marker of the rejection after heart transplantation.782 A voltammetric immunosensor for NT-proBNP was fab- ricated using Fab fragment of a NT-proBNP-speci c monoclonal antibody modi ed with magnetic nanoparticles and captured by a magnet placed under the surface of a goldelectrode.783Using CV, the sensor detected NT-proBNP in the linear range from 40 ng L1to 2.5 gL1, with a LOD 30 ng L1. The proposed system was integrated into a micro fluidic device, which enabled a continuous measurement of NT-proBNP levelwithin two linear dynamic ranges from 5 ng L 1to 1.7 gL1and 1.7 to 4 gL1, LOD 3 ng L1.94 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for NT-proBNP was developed using an anti-NT-proBNP antibody immobilized ontothe surface of a gold electrode functionalized with goldnanostructures/CNTs composite. 784After capture of NT- proBNP, a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody labeled withgold nanochains was added followed by a mixture of H 2O2and hydroquinone to develop a signal, as shown in Figure 40 .C V measurements revealed a linear correlation between the signaland NT-proBNP concentration in the range from 20 ng L1to 100gL1, with a LOD of 6 ng L1. A competitive amperometric magneto-immunosensor for NT- proBNP was designed by immobilizing the antigen onto magnetic beads.785The target NT-proBNP in the sample and that immobilized on the magnetic beads competed for binding toaxed amount of a HRP-labeled secondary antibody. The immunoconjugate-bearing magnetic beads were captured by amagnet positioned beneath the surface of a screen-printed goldelectrode. The amperometric response was generated uponaddition of a mixture of TMB and H 2O2, and a linear range of detection was observed (0.12 42.9gL1) with a LOD of 20 ng L1. 5.2.5. Creatine Kinase-Myocardial Band (CK-MB). MB of creatine kinase. The primarysource of CK-MB is myocardium, also found inskeletal muscles. 786The cardiac isoenzyme CK-MB is highly specic to cardiac injury, and its level in serum (0 3gL1) increases within 4 6 h after onset of acute myocardial infarction.787 A voltammetric sensing platform for CK-MB was constructed using the electrochemically active phosphorylated form ofcreatine immobilized onto the surface of a screen-printed goldelectrode. 788A reduction in the SWV signal was observed upon incubation with CK-MB in the linear range from 190 gL1to 28.8 mg L1, with Apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100). ApoB-100 is the major protein in low density lipoprotein (LDL), and it acts asa ligand for LDL receptors in various cell types throughout thebody. 789The apolipoprotein-related mortality risk (AMORIS) study has indicated that high levels of ApoB-100 are signi cantly correlated with coronary artery disease.790The normal values of ApoB-100 in blood range between 0.4 and 1.3 g L1.791 An impedimetric sensor for ApoB-100 was fabricated using an anti-ApoB-100 antibody immobilized onto the surface of a highlyordered macroporous gold lm.792Subsequently, a mixture of an ionic liquid (BMIm+BF4) and silica sol was dropped onto the electrode to entrap the adsorbed antibodies rmly. A linear relationship was established between the charge-transferresistance and the logarithm of ApoB-100 concentration in therange from 5 pg L 1to 50 ng L1, with a LOD of 5 pg L1. Another impedimetric immunosensor for ApoB-100 used nanobodies, generated by an immunized phage display library,and immobilized onto the surface of a GCE modi ed with Figure 40.

P-Selectin. This protein plays a physiological role in modulating the adhesive interactions between the blood cells and the endothelium during in flammatory processes at the sites of injury. The concentration of soluble P-selectin in plasma can bemeasured and used as a clinical predictor for cardiovasculardisorders, resulting in the presumption that it is secreted, shed, or cleaved from the cell membrane in the course of the disease. 794 Increased levels of soluble P-selectin in the plasma (>140 g L1)795have been associated with a range of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atrialbrillation.796 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensing platform for P- selectin was constructed using an anti-P-selectin antibody immobilized onto the surface of a screen-printed carbonelectrode modi ed with potassium ferrocyanide-encapsulated, anti-P-selectin-tagged liposome was utilized as a signaling tag. Using SWV, the resultingdoseresponse curve possessed a linear analytical range from 0.1 ng L 1to 10 mg L1. 5.2.8. Heart Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP). H- FABP is a cytosolic protein mainly expressed by myocytes.798It is elevated in plasma (>5.3 gL1) after cardiac damage and may be the earliest available plasma marker of acute myocardial injury.799It may have better diagnostic accuracy than other cardiac markers in the early stages after onset of symptoms.800 A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for H-FABP was fabricated using an anti-H-FABP antibody immobilized onto the surface of a GCE.801The signaling tag was prepared using zinc ions-functionalized titanium phosphate nanospheres modi ed with the secondary antibody. The metal ions in the bioconjugate were detected directly using SWV without acid dissolution orpreconcentration, and H-FABP analysis was demonstrated with a linear range from 50 pg L 1to 50 gL1, and a LOD of 3 pg L1. A capacitive immunosensor for H-FABP was constructed using an anti-H-FABP antibody immobilized onto the surface ofa gold interdigitated microelectrode integrated within a micro- fluidic device.802This sensor allowed for the detection of H- FABP in the linear range from 98 ng L1to 100 gL1. 5.2.9. Aspartate Transaminase (AST). AST transfer of an -amino group between aspartate and glutamate, and thus it plays a signi cant role in amino acid metabolism.803AST was rst used as a biochemical marker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in 1954. However, the use of AST as a cardiac marker is currently redundant and hasbeen superseded by cardiac troponins. 804The normal values of AST in blood range between 5 and 40 U L1.805In addition, the AST level increases in hepatic disorders, such as hepatitis andliver cirrhosis. 806 A multienzyme-based voltammetric sensor pyruvate oxidase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase coimmobilized onto the surface electrode using layer-by-layer deposition technique. 807Subsequently, L-glutamate and oxaloacetate were generated by the enzyme reaction in the presence of -ketoglutarate and L-aspartate. The oxaloacetate generated was converted to pyruvate by oxaloacetate decarbox- ylase, as shown in Figure 41 . CV analysis of pyruvate was conducted using pyruvate ox idase and ferrocenemethanol electron shuttle. Anodically generated oxidative currents were proportional to AST levels in the range from 7.5 to 720 U L1.Also, an internally calibrated electrochemical continuous enzyme assay was developed for AST analysis.808This assay was described in detail in the LDH section . The assay permitted linear interrogation of AST level up to 70 U L1, with a LOD of 0.1 U L1. There are other important cardiac markers that have not yet been targeted with electroche mical sensing (sLOX-1). A summary of thecardiac markers is provided in Table 3 . Figure 41.

Alanine Transaminase (ALT). ALT catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to -ketoglutarate, which is a critical process within the tricarboxylic acid cycle.813 When liver injury occurs, ALT is released from injured liver cellsinto the bloodstream. Elevated levels of ALT in serum (>40 U L 1) have been associated with a range of hepatic disorders, including hepatitis, liver cancer, and alcohol toxicity.814ALT is one of many important hepatic markers ( Table 4 ). A peptide-based impedimetric sensor for ALT was constructed using an ALT-speci c peptide, selected from an M13 phage displayed peptide library, modi ed with a C-terminal cysteine and immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.815This approach facilitated the determination of ALT levels down to 92gL 1. 5.3.2. -Glutamyl transfer of the - glutamyl moiety of glutathione an amino acid, a peptide, orwater.816Elevated serum GGT (>40 U L1) is generally used as an indicator of liver disorders, such as biliary obstruction, alcoholtoxicity, and exposure to certain drugs.817Recently, several studies have demonstrated that higher serum GGT levels are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and certain types ofcancer.818 A voltammetric sensor for GGT was fabricated using a glutathione substrate immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode through interaction between the thiol group of glutathione and the gold surface.819After complexation with ions, the glutathione-modi ed electrode redox of the Cu2+/Cu+couple. After incubation with GGT, the glutamic acid moiety was o , leaving the cysteinylglycine moiety on the electrode, which could not form acomplex with Cu 2+, leading to a reduced current. Using CV, GGT levels were determined down to 5 kU L1. 5.3.3. Bilirubin (BR). BR is the tetrapyrrole end product of the heme moiety found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, andrespiratory enzymes, such as cytochromes. The production of BR occurs in reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen. It is converted into urobilinogens by bacteria in the intestine, whichare excreted partly in the urine. Hence, the BR concentration canbe used to assess liver functions and identify various liverdiseases, such as jaundice and cirrhosis. 820The normal levels of serum BR are as follows: direct (also called conjugated) BR, 0 3 mg L1; and total BR, 3 19 mg L1.821 An enzyme-based amperometric sensor for BR was fabricated using oxidase immobilized on the surface prede-posited onto a gold electrode. 822This sensor exhibited a linear range extending from 11.7 gL1to 146.2 mg L1, with a LOD of 58.5 ng L1. BR contains an active site moiety, dipyrromethane, that is oxidized to form biliverdin. However, a catalyst forBR oxidation has not been elucidated.823A nonenzymatic amperometric for was constructed using a Mn Cu bimetallic crystal electrode coated with a Na on membrane. Using CA, the BR levels in the range from 0.7 to 245.6 mg L1 were measured, with a LOD of 14.6 gL1. In addition, an alternative nonenzymatic approach was adopted using nano-graphite grown on the surface of platinum microelectrodes.824 SWV measurements allowed for the determination of BR levelsdown to 32.7 mg L 1. 5.3.4. Human Serum Albumin (HSA). HSA is the most abundant protein in human serum. It is essential for maintainingthe osmotic pressure, and its level in human urine is a keyreference for clinical assays and diagnosis. The reference range for HSA concentrations in serum is 35 50 mg L 1.825An increased HSA level is widely established as one of the earliestprognostic markers for liver diseases, such as liver cirrhosis as wellas kidney and cardiovascular disorders. 826 An impedimetric immunosensor for HSA was constructed using an anti-HSA antibody immobilized onto the surface of ascreen-printed gold electrode.827The LOD was 0.2 mg L1for this albumin sensor. A MIP-based voltammetric sensor for HSA graft of acrylamide template.828The subzero polymerization allowed the solvent to form ice crystals, leaving a macroporous cryogel structure afterthawing. After extraction of the template molecules, the speci c imprinted surface was used to detect HSA using ferroceneentrapped in the cryogel, as shown in Figure 42 . Using DPV, the relationship between oxidation current and the logarithm of theHSA concentration was linear in the range from 100 ng L 1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 50 ng L1. 5.4. In flammatory Markers 5.4.1. C-Reactive Protein (CRP). CRP is a pentameric complex of identical protomers synthesized in the liver andnamed after its reaction with the somatic C-polysaccharide ofStreptococcus pneumonia . 830It is found in the blood of healthy individuals at levels below 3 mg L1, rising by 2 or more orders of magnitude in response to in flammation or infection. More recently, subtle changes between 0.1 and 10 mg L1have been strongly correlated with predictions of future coronary events.831 Similar subtle changes occur during early responses to bacterialand fungal infection or malignancy, while larger increases areassociated with chronic in flammatory diseases and physiological trauma. 832 An impedimetric sensing platform for CRP used an anti-CRP antibody or a mer immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.833Notably, an a mer is a small, highly stable engineered nonantibody probe molecule based on thethioredoxin834or stenA835scaold that can replace antibodies in many detection platforms. A linear correlation wasdemonstrated between the resistance to charge transfer andTable 4.

A sandwich-based amperometric sensor for CRP was constructed using an anti-CRP antibody immobilized onto thesurface of a screen-printed gold electrode.836Subsequent to CRP capture, a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was added. Afterincubation with a mixture of TMB and H 2O2, CA permitted the quanti cation of CRP level up to 100 gL1, with a LOD of 2.6 gL1. The same approach was adopted using a centrifugal microfluidic device, which allowed for the detection of CRP level down to 4.9 ng L1.837 Another sandwich-type immunoassay involved the physisorp- tion of anti-CRP antibody on the surface of the sensor,sequential immunoreactions with CRP and biotinylated 838The quanti cation of the target protein was performed after acidic dissolution of the PbS QDs and ASVmeasurement of the released Pb(II). It was observed that theresponse was linear over the range 0.2 100gL 1CRP, with a LOD of 50 ng L1. In another approach, an alkaline phosphatase- conjugated secondary antibody was utilized, and the analysis wascarried out within a micro fluidic device.839Linear analysis of CRP was permissible in the range from 0.1 to 10 mg L1. 5.4.2. Tumor Necrosis Factor- (TNF- ).TNF- is an extremely potent in flammatory peptide cytokine produced by the cells of the immune system.840Generally, the concentration of TNF- in blood is very low (3.9 18.5 ng L1).841When overproduced, the TNF- plays a major role in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, in flammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer and ankylosing spondylitis.842 A voltammetric aptasensor blue-labeled TNF- specic aptamer immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.843SWV measurements revealed the ability of the aptasensor to determine the TNF- level up to 100 gL1, with a LOD of 10 gL1.An impedimetric immunosensor for TNF- was constructed using an anti-TNF- antibody immobilized onto the surface of an array of gold microelectrodes within a micro fluidic device.844 The analytical system revealed a linear relationship with increasing TNF- concentrations in the range of 1 1000 ng L1, with a LOD of 1 ng L1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for TNF- was developed using GNPs-labeled primary antibodies immobilizedonto the surface with ferrocene monocarboxylic acid-functionalized peptide nanowire.845The signaling was prepared using gold nanorods as carriers for thesecondary antibody and glucose oxidase. After capture of TNF- , the enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of glucose in the presence offerrocene as a mediator for signal transduction. Using SWV as ameasurement approach, this sensor exhibited a linear rangeextending from 5 ng L 1to 10 gL1, with a LOD of 2 ng L1.I n another approach, the secondary antibody was immobilized onto the surface of silica nanospheres functionalized with CdTequantum dots.846The cadmium ions were released treatment with an acidic solution and subsequently oxidized.Stripping voltammetric analysis allowed for the quanti cation of TNF- in the linear range from 10 ng L 1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 3 ng L1. 5.4.3. Haptoglobin (Hp). Hp is an acute phase protein that binds free hemoglobin to prevent its oxidative damage in the vascular system.847Hp level could be used as an index factor for certain diseases. For example, a low concentration of plasma Hpcan be used as an index for hemolytic diseases,848whereas Hp concentration is markedly increased in patients with in flamma- tory diseases. The normal serum Hp level ranges between 0.36and 1.95 g L 1.849 An impedimetric immunosensor for Hp was fabricated using an anti-Hp antibody immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.850This sensor permitted the analysis of Hp levels with a LOD of 90 ng L1. 5.4.4. Transferrin (TSF). TSF is an iron-binding plasma glycoprotein that controls the level of free iron in biologicalfluids.851An increased plasma TSF level is often observed in patients su ering from iron de ciency.852In contrast, low levels of TSF are associated with in flammation and protein malnutrition.853The reference range of TSF is 1.75 3.13 g L1.854 A volatmmetric sensing platform for TSF was constructed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated concanavalin Aimmobilized onto the surface of a nanoporous gold electrode.855 It was observed that the binding between the TSF andimmobilized concanavalin A has reduced the enzymaticconversion rate of p-aminophenyl phosphate by the conjugated enzyme. Using SWV, the level of TSF was determined down to 11.2 mg L 1. 5.4.5. Transthyretin (TTR). TTR is a serum and cerebrospinal fluid carrier of the thyroid hormone thyroxin and retinol-binding protein bound to retinol. The liver secretes TTRinto the blood, whereas it is secreted by the choroid plexus intothe cerebrospinal fluid. 856Many circumstances are associated with reduced serum levels of TTR such as acute phase response due to in flammation, rheumatoid arthritis, malignancy, and trauma.857The normal values of TTR range between 235 and 293 mg L1.858 A voltammetric sensing platform for naphthalene-2,3- dicarboxyaldehyde-labeled TTR was fabricated using a two-electrode system integrated in a micro fluidic device.859The LOD of the assay was 1.4 mg L1.

IGF-1 is a peptide hormone secreted by the liver as a result of stimulationby the growth hormone.860The normal range of IGF-1 is dierent in various ages, and it varies from 1 to 1096 gL1.861 Lower IGF-1 levels reduce the protection against in flammation and may have a role in metabolic syndrome development causedby an imbalance between featured an anti- IGF-1 antibody immobilized onto the surface of a GNPs-modied gold electrode.863The immunosensor showed linearity over 1180 ng 0.2 ng L1. A sandwich-type amperometric sensor for IGF-1 was designed using a primary antibody immobilized onto the surface of a MWCNTs-modi ed GCE precoated with electropolymerized with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, thesensor was incubated with the substrate H 2O2and catechol as a redox mediator. Using amperometry, the calibration graph for IGF-1 showed a linearity range extending from 0.5 to 1000 ngL 1, with a LOD of 0.3 ng L1. 5.4.7. -Amylase. This is an enzyme produced by the pancreas that catalyzes the hydrolysis of -1,4 glycosidic bonds present in starch, glycogen, and other related carbohydrates. Inhealthy humans, there is only a relatively small amount of amylase in blood (31 107 U L 1);865however, the level of the enzyme is elevated during pancreatitis and salivary glandinflammation.866 An electrochemical sensor for -amylase was fabricated using maltopentose substrate immobilized onto the surface of a goldelectrode.867The enzyme level was determined by analyzing the electrochemical signal obtained from the electro-active molecule[Ru(NH 3)5Cl]2+during the hydrolysis of maltopentose. Using CC, a linear relationship was established between the surface charge density of the electrode and the enzyme concentrationwithin the range from 30 U L 1to 3 kU L1, with a LOD of 22 U L1. There are other in flammatory markers, such as brinogen,658 ferritin,592IL-6,868and IL-8,869which were discussed in details in theTumor Markers section. A summary of the in flammatory markers is provided in Table 5 . 5.5. Other Protein Markers 5.5.1. Antibodies. In the past few years, an explosion in the number of electrochemical sensors targeting antibodies that are present in blood or at the surface of cells has occurred. For example, analysis of diagnostically relevant antibodies is thecentral core for the detection active pathogens and monitoring of disease progression and responsiveness to therapy.870Also, human immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a mediator in allergicreactions because it can bind to basophils and mast cells to triggerthe release of chemicals like histamine, leukotrienes, and certain interleukins that can cause symptoms associated with allergies. 871 Total serum IgE levels <300 kU L1are considered in the normal or borderline range.872In addition, anti-DNA antibodies are important markers for the diagnosis of several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronicautoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by theproduction of an array of IgM and IgG autoantibodies directed against nuclear components. 873,874Furthermore, the determi-Table 5.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXBEnation of antigliadin antibodies from human serum samples is of vital importance for the diagnosis of celiac disease, anautoimmune disease associated with the ingestion of gluten bysusceptible individuals causing histological changes in the smallintestine mucosa and leading to a malabsorption. 875 An impedimetric immunosensor for the antibiotin antibody was fabricated by modifying a gold electrode with 4-thiophenolpassivating layers via diazonium salt chemistry.876Subsequently, the attachment of GNPs followed by a biotin derivative wascarried out. The increase in charge-transfer resistance waslinearly proportional to the concentration of antibiotin IgG in therange of 5 500gL 1, with a 5 gL1. A peptide-based voltammetric sensor for anti-HIV-1-p24 protein antibody was fabricated using a methylene blue-modied peptide immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.21Using ACV, the antibody level was quanti ed within the linear range from 750 gL1to 15 mg L1, with a LOD of 750 gL1. A voltammetric aptasensor for IgE using a methylene blue-labeled pseudoknot aptamer probe immobilizedonto the surface of a gold electrode.877The binding of IgE to the aptamer probes led to conformational changes of the pseudoknotaptamer structure and subsequently brought the redox-tag inclose proximity to the electrode, resulting in an ampli ed signal, as shown in Figure 43 . Using SWV, the level of IgE was quanti ed down to 9 gL 1. In addition, aptamers speci c to the antigen binding fragment of antivesicular stomatitis virus antibodies weredeveloped to shield the oncolytic virus from neutralizingantibodies and enhance its in vivo survival. 878EIS measurements demonstrated the ability of some aptamer clones to retain morethan 50% of viral infection in the presence of neutralizingantibodies in serum. A nucleic acid-based voltammetric using methylene blue-labeled ssDNAand ds-DNA immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode. 879 SWV measurements revealed the ability of the sensor todetermine the antibody level down to 1.5 mg L 1. Also, a nucleic acid-based electrochemical switch for antibody detection was designed, taking advantage of the concurrence oftwo antigen-binding sites, separated by 12 nm, on each antibody.880The switch comprised a single-stranded DNA probe containing two identical, covalently linked antigens that weremodied at one terminus with a thiol group and at the other terminus with methylene blue. In the absence of a targetantibody, the DNA adopted a stem-loop conformation, bringingthe two antigens together and the redox label near the goldelectrode surface, which facilitated fast electron transfer. Uponbinding of the target antibody, the DNA probe opened and moved the redox label away from the electrode surface, thus resulting in a slower electron transfer, as shown in Figure 44 . SWV measurements allowed for the detection of anti-HIVantibody AF5 level down to 1.5 mg L 1. Another nucleic acid-based voltammetric sensing platform for antibodies relied on a peptide epitope coupled to the distal end ofa gold electrode-bound nucleic acid \"scaold\"tagged with methylene blue.881The binding of the target antibody to the epitope reduced the e ciency with which the redox reporter exchanges electrons with the underlying sensor electrode,causing a change in current, as shown in Figure 45 . Using SWV, the level of anti-FLAG antibody was quanti ed down to 75 gL 1. A sandwich-based voltammetric sensor for HIV antibody was fabricated using antigenic peptides from HIV-1 gp41 or HIV-2gp36 covalently attached to an SU-8 substrate, which presented a template for the deposition of three-dimensional microelectr-odes.882The detection of HIV antibodies was achieved using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, whichreacted with p-aminophenyl phosphate to produce an electro- chemically active product, p-aminophenol, as shown in Figure 46 . Using DPV, the current derived from the oxidation of thereporter correlated linearly with antibody concentrations in therange from 1 gL 1to 1 mg L1, with a LOD of 1 gL1, for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. An electrochemical steric-hindrance hybridization assay (eSHHA) was recently reported for the detection of antibod- ies.883In this approach, a signaling DNA probe was modi ed with methylene blue at the proximal end and with digoxigenin atthe terminal end. A complementary DNA capture probe wasimmobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode. In the absenceof antidigoxigenin antibody, the two strands were hybridized(signal-ON). However, the presence of the antibody stericallyhindered the hybridization between the two probes and Figure 44. An antibody (Ab)-activated electrochemical \"switch \". The switch is composed of a single-stranded DNA probe containing two identical, covalently linked antigens (black crosses) and modi ed at one terminus with a thiol group and at the other terminus with methyleneblue.

In the absence of antibody binding (left), the flexibility of the surface attachment chemistry supported relatively e cient electron transfer between the redox reporter and the electrode surface. Binding to the relevant target antibody (right) decreased electron transfer, presumably by reducing the e ciency with which the reporter collides with the electrode.

A voltammetric sensing platform for a model hapten, 2,4- dinitrophenyl group, was designed using poly(propyleneglycol)methacrylate-modi ed gold which was further modied with the hapten. 884The assay relied on the electro- chemical detection of H 2O2, generated through the intrinsic catalytic activity of all antibodies, in the presence of singletoxygen ( 1O2*), which can be generated by a photosensitizer. The mole ratio of H 2O2per antibody was 640 1200. Using SWV, the antibody level was determined down to 300 ng L1. An amperometric supramolecular platform for antigliadin IgA and IgG autoantibodies was developed on the basis of theinterfacial self-assembly of a bifunctionalized carboxymethylcel-lulose bearing adamantane fragment ontocyclodextrin-modi ed gold electrode. 885The calibration plot was linear up to 750 gL1, a LOD of 20 gL1. 5.5.2. Hemoglobin is a that contains four polypeptide subunits (two and two subunits) of similar structure, each of which has an iron-bearing heme withinmolecularly accessible crevices.886Hb de ciency can be caused either by a decreased amount of hemoglobin molecules, as inanemia, or by the reduced ability of Hb to bind O 2. Other common causes of low hemoglobin include nutritionaldeciency, bone marrow diseases, kidney failure, and Hb defects (such as that of sickle-cell disease). In nonpregnant women,normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 to 160 g L 1. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 to 180 g L1.887 A voltammetric sensing platform for Hb was presented on the basis of red blood cells or raw blood cells immobilized onto thesurface of a GCE coated with a Na onlm.888CV analyses revealed a well-de ned reduction peak for hemoglobin at about 0.30 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in a pH 3.5 bu er solution. The linear dynamic range of the sensor extended from 0 to 1.45 g L1of red blood cells. A woven fabric-based voltammetric sensor for Hb was prepared using silk yarns coated with conducting inks beforebeing woven into patches of fabric to create an array of sensors.Using DPV, a good correlation was observed between the Hbconcentration and the corresponding peak current with a LOD of 23 g L 1. 5.5.3. Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c).HbA1cis the main form of glycohemoglobin. It is generated from the Amadorirearrangement reaction of glucose with the N-terminal valine of one or both hemoglobin -chains. 889Glycation is a dynamic process because red blood cells are turned over approximatelyevery 90 120 days; thus HbA 1clevels approximate the average blood glucose for the past 2 3 months. Determination of HbA 1c level is a very useful tool for the long-term glycemic control of diabetes without the in fluence of short-term fluctuations of blood glucose. The clinical reference range of HbA1c, as a relative content of total hemoglobin (Hb), is 5 20%, and the range within 4 6% is considered as normal. Furthermore, the 2010 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care inDiabetes has included % HbA 1c6.5% as a criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.890 A competitive voltammetric sensor for HbA 1cused a GCE modied with a mixed layer of an oligo(phenylethynylene) molecular wire and an oligo(ethylene glycol) formed via in situ-generated aryl diazonium cations.891To the terminal end of the Figure 46.

HbA 1canalysis relied on the competition for binding to anti-HbA 1cantibodies between the analyte and the surface bound GPP. The presence of HbA 1cresulted in the attenuation of ferrocene redox current. SWV revealed a linear relationship between thecurrent and HbA 1clevel ranging from 4.5% to 15.1% of total hemoglobin in serum. A competitive potentiometric method for measuring HbA1c and Hb in blood hemolysate was reported.892The method relied on the competitive binding between HbA 1cand the alizarin red to phenylboronic acid via diol-boronic acid complexation. It wasobserved that the solution potential shifted positively in the presence of HbA 1c. In addition, the total Hb concentration was determined by oxidizing Hb using Fe(CN) 63and measuring the potential shift arising from the reduction of Fe(CN) 63. A linear correlation between the potential shift and the logarithm of the Hb concentration was observed up to 100 g L1. In an alternative approach, competitive binding between HbA 1cand glucose oxidase was utilized for voltammetric analysis 1c.893The system permitted the quanti cation of HbA1clevel range of Interferon- (IFN- ).IFN- is an in flammatory cytokine produced primarily by natural killer cells and thymus-derived (T) cells in response to various pathogens and possessesmany physiological roles in immune systems and in flammatory stimuli. 894Abnormal levels of IFN- are related to many infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.895The normal levels of IFN- in serum range between 0.8 and 1.4 kU L1.896 A voltammetric sensor for IFN- was fabricated using a methylene blue-labeled speci c IFN- aptamer immobilized onto the surface a gold electrode.897Binding of IFN- caused the aptamer hairpin to unfold, pushing methylene blue moleculesaway from the electrode and reducing electron transfer e ciency. SWV measurements demonstrated a linear relationship between the current signal and IFN- level up to 171.5 gL 1, with a LOD of 1gL1. A similar LOD was obtained upon integration of the sensor into a micro fluidic device.898In addition, the device was incubated with T-cell-speci c antibodies (anti-CD4). Upon injection of blood, leukocytes were captured, and IFN- release was triggered by mitogenic activation and detected at theaptamer-modi ed electrodes using SWV. The observed IFN- release pro les were used to calculate an initial IFN- production rate of 7.9 ng cell 1h1upon activation. A FET-based sensor for IFN- was constructed using an IFN- specic aptamer attached to graphene.899Incubation with IFN- induced a change in the charge distribution in the electrolyte, leading to an increase in electron transfer e ciency monitored by the device. This sensor allowed for the linear quanti cation of IFN- up to 171.5 mg L1, with a LOD of 1.4 gL1.

Trypsin. Trypsin cleaves proteins on the C-terminal side of arginineand lysine residues. It is produced initially as the proenzymetrypsinogen, which then self-cleaves to yield the more activeform. 906This self-regulating process is altered by in flammatory conditions, such as pancreatitis, which results in the release ofenzyme into the bloodstream. Healthy individuals have a trypsinlevel of 250 gL 1in serum.907 An electrochemical sensing platform for trypsin was designed on the basis of the proteolytic generation of an electroactivespecies (P) by trypsin followed by a signal-ampli ed electro- chemical measurement of P using ECC redox cycling.908The detection was performed using a bare ITO electrode. P wasgenerated by the cleavage of an amide bond between P (Gly-Pro-Arg) C-terminal of Gly-Pro-Arg-P.Among four trypsin substrates was produce the highest signal-to-noise ratio.Using CC, the trypsin level was determined in the linear rangefrom 1 to 1000 gL 1, with a LOD of 1 gL1. Flash chronopotentiometry (CP) was used for the detection of trypsin by applying an appropriate current pulse across apolycation-selective polymer membrane electrode formulatedwith tridodecylmethylammonium-dinonylnaphthalenesulfonate,where dinonylnaphthalenesulfonate served as a polycationicpeptide recognition element. 909The current pulse induced a strong flux of the polycationic peptides from the sample phase into the organic membrane of the electrode, which yielded a drastic potential change in the observed chronopotentiogram at the transition time ( ). The activity of trypsin was subsequently determined in the linear range from 20 gL1to 6.1 mg L1,i n the presence of protamine as a substrate. 5.5.7. Endotheline-1 (ET-1). ET-1 is a chemokine that plays role in vasoconstriction and broblast proliferation.910 Elevated ET-1 expression levels have been implicated as a signicant risk factor for both acute and chronic lung injury.

Also, an antifouling impedimetric aptasensor for was dithiothreitol, and mercaptohexanol onto the surfaceof a gold electrode.919The increase in the electron-transfer resistance was directly proportional to the TB concentrationwithin the range from 1 to 20 gL 1, with a LOD of 0.3 gL1. A voltammetric proximity assay for TB was developed using two TB-speci c aptamers, which formed a cooperative complex only in the presence of TB, moving a methylene blue-conjugated oligonucleotide to the proximity of the gold electrode surface, asshown in Figure 48 .920TB levels as low as 1.8 gL1were detected using direct electrochemical readout, with a dynamicrange up to 367 gL 1.5.5.9. -Amyloid Peptide (A ).Ais a peptide cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein that is present in the brain andcerebrospinal fluid.921In its native form, A is unfolded, but it aggregates into a -sheet structure of ordered brils under various conditions.922The amount of extracellular soluble A in the brain has been considered as a key predictor of cognitiveimpairment associated with Alzheimer 's disease.923Two major C-terminal variants of A ,A(140)and A (142), have been identied in amyloid deposits from the brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease. Although A (140)is natively present in higher quantities, A (142)exhibits faster rates of aggregation, generates more free radical damage, and is considered the moreneurotoxic of the two species.924 An impedimetric immunosensor for A (142)was made using a conformation-speci cAantibody immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode via a 3,3 -dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl) Figure 47. Protein detection using ion channels. Steps 1 6 show the fabrication steps starting from the polymeric membrane and ultimately producing multiple ion channel thrombin sensors. The inner wall of each ion channel was rst modi ed with thrombin-speci c aptamers. Next, one side of the membrane was sprayed with GNPs to create a working electrode. [Ru(NH3)6]3+was then electrostatically attached to the aptamer backbone. Finally, the repulsion between the added thrombin and [Ru(NH3)6]3+has led to an enhanced redox signal.

XXXX, XXX, XXX XXXBIpropionate linker.925The binding between A (142)and the immobilized antibody was accompanied by an increase in thecharge-transfer resistance over time. A voltammetric sensor for A 42 was reported on the basis of the oxidation of the tyrosine moiety of A 42 adsorbed on a basal plane graphite electrode followed by DPV.926The dependence of the tyrosine oxidation current on the concentration of adsorbedA42 followed a Langmuir isotherm with a saturation level reached at peptide concentrations exceeding 450 M. A signal-ON voltammetric sensor for A (1228)was fabricated using A (1228)-Cys immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.927Ferrocene bioconjugates, bearing a podant (Lys)- Leu-Val-Phe-Phe motif, interacted with the immobilized A(1228)-Cyslm on the gold surface followed by measuring the current response of the ferrocene redox process.

Afterimmunocomplex formation, electrochemical reduction ofthionine was used to interrogate the A level. Using DPV, the peak current showed a linear relationship with A (140/142)in the concentration range of 0.2 40 nM, with a LOD of 50 pM. 5.5.10. Tau Protein. Tau protein stabilizes microtubules in neuronal cells; however, upon hyperphosphorylation, (NFTs) and paired helical laments (PHFs), which alongside A plaques are associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease.929,930 A voltammetric sensing platform was designed to monitor the conformational changes of tau protein immobilized onto thesurface of a gold electrode upon hyperphosphorylation.931The method relied on 5 --ferrocenyl adenosine triphosphate derivative as a cosubstrate to probe the protein was accompanied by a characteristic ferroceneredox signal detected via CV and SWV. In addition, thephosphorylation reaction introduced the electrostatic charges intau, and triggered the changes in the ferrocene-tau lm orientation and conformation on the surface. The kineticparameters the biochemical process ( K Mand Vmax) were determined.932 Also, EIS was employed to monitor the conformational changes of immobilized tau protein upon phosphorylation, which in turn enabled its interaction with peptidyl-prolyl cis/ trans isomerase, Pin1, through residues of phosphorylated tau protein.933Experimental results demonstrated an increase in the interfacial resistanceupon binding between Pin1 and phosphorylated tau protein.Several reports have pointed out that the Cu(II) ion may play an important role in tau biochemistry. An electrochemical study was carried out to probe the interactions between the full-length tau-410 and Cu(II) ions. 934The study revealed that Cu(II) uptake by phosphorylated tau over nonphosphorylated proteinwas observed at low pH by virtue of the characteristic Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox couple at 140 \u00b15 mV versus Ag/AgCl. In addition, EIS was recently utilized to monitor tau tau binding and misfolding during the early stage of tau oligomerization. 935It was observed that the interaction between solution tau protein andimmobilized tau protein on the surface of a gold electrode wasaccompanied by a reduction in the interfacial resistance, electrostatic changes induced bytautau the frequently activated cysteine protease during apoptosis, and has beenestablished as a key mediator and cellular marker of apoptosis. 936 Deregulation of apoptosis is usually associated with a variety of diseases such as neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and autoimmune diseases.937 A voltammetric sensing platform for caspase-3 was designed on the basis of the ability of the enzyme to cleave a p-nitroaniline labeled tetra-peptide substrate, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp.938In this method, p-nitroanailine released from the peptide was measured by DPV using a GCE, which allowed for the determination of theenzyme level in the linear range from 0.01 to 4 U. Another voltammetric sensor was prepared using a biotin- labeled speci c peptide immobilized onto the surface of a gold electrode.939In the absence of caspase-3, a signaling probe composed of streptavidin-coated CNTs/CdTe quantum dotsbecame bound to the immobilized peptide, and the cadmiumions were quanti ed by ASV after dissolving the quantum dots in HNO 3. In the presence of the enzyme, the peptide was cleaved and the biotin molecules subsequently di used away from theTable 6.

A variety of electrochemical sensors have been developed for the detection of many hormones, such hormones were discussed in the Neurotransmitters andTumor Markers and Inflammatory Markers sections. In addition, electrochemical analysis of hormones was recently reviewed elsewhere.957A summary of these protein markers is provided in Table 6 . 5.6. Sensitivity and Speci city Challenges for Electrochemical Protein Analysis Systems Although electrochemical assays of small molecules have proven most successful in making the transition from the central lab tothe point-of-care, detection of larger molecules, such as proteins,is a more challenging problem. This is due to the nonspeci c adsorption of biological fluid components at transducing sensor surfaces, and the lack of enzyme/analyte pairs for many proteintargets. Additionally, stringent speci city is desirable to ensure accurate discrimination among a variety of biomolecules encountered in clinical samples. Furthermore, to enable routineuse of diagnostics, rapid turnaround on the time scale of aphysician visit ( 20 min) is required. As we have demonstrated in this section, many protein markers are present at very lowlevels (femtomolar to attmolar) in the patients. Hence, a majorchallenge for electrochemical protein sensing technologies hasbeen to improve the sensitivity dramatically. Achieving a clinically relevant combination of sensitivity, specicity, and speed in protein detection has witnessed rapid progress through the use of materials of di erent length scales. For instance, microscale materials that possess a large core ofactive material are better suited for utilization as capture agents.On the other hand, nanoscale materials with high surface-to-volume ratios are better carriers for signaling tags in proteinanalysis. Combining these materials enables e cient capture of target proteins while facilitating ultrasensitive analysis. Thiscapability will be useful in detecting biomarkers that are presentat very low levels and subsequently monitoring diseaserecurrence more e ciently. Because most biomarker detection techniques utilize small samples, it is possible that rarebiomarkers might not be identi ed. Hence, electrochemical sensing technologies will be required to continue to analyzelarger samples at lower detection limits. 6. SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS Electrochemical sensors o er many attractive analytical features and represent promising candidates for future clinicaldiagnostics. Many of the electrochemical methods discussed inthis Review allow rapid, selective, and highly sensitive analysis of clinically relevant molecules, without involving preconcentration steps. However, there are still several issues that must beaddressed before they are implemented into point-of-carediagnostics. For example, progress at the sampling stage lagsbehind the assay chemistry and detection technologies in termsof research output and perceived signi cance. Given that the blood volume is 5 L and the interstitial fluid volume is 17 L, thereis a high probability that small samples will not contain any target analytes. This would result in a stochastic distribution of falsenegatives and necessitates addressing the limitations of bulk fluid sampling. It is thus becoming obvious that signi cant research eorts are needed to develop innovative sampling approaches to simplify the downstream operations of electrochemical diag-nostics. Furthermore, designing biosensors capable of continu-ously monitoring the biomolecules in real-time would reduce theneed for frequent sample collection and open new venues forsimple end point testing applications. Also, the design of sensing platforms based on nanoscaled transducers creates a need f or developing techniques to overcome mass-transfer limitations by actuating the fluid motion at the nanoscale level. Additionally, incorporating nanomaterialsinto these sensors highlights the necessity to assess the biocompatibility and environmental friendliness of these nano- materials. Although some progress has been made in multiplexed electrochemical sensing, further advances are still needed. It isexpected that research into genetic pro ling of diseases will create a demand for sensors with high multiplexing capabilitiesthat can handle hundreds of biomarkers in short turnaroundtimes. In addition, simultaneous detection of multiple targetsrequires minimum or no cross-reaction between the a nity ligands and target biomolecules. Thus, better selection of a nity ligands and rational design of nucleic acid probes should improvethe performance of electrochemical sensors. A newly developedtechnique for the selection of slow o -rate modi ed aptamers (SOMAmers) for 813 proteins with high binding a nity and specicity highlights that continued progress will be made in this area. Also, application of modi ed SELEX techniques could accelerate the generation of aptamers for more clinicalbiomolecules. 958960 Integration of electrochemical sensors into fully automated systems that can relay results with no human intervention isessential to achieve a widespread use of the point-of-care devices.The analytical methods discussed in this Review were mainlyconcerned with the automation of key elements of the assay, suchas sample processing or readout, but still include manual steps.However, full automation of electrochemical assays will facilitatethe generation of accurate results even in the absence of trainedpersonnel. In summary, there are major challenges to be addressed before electrochemical sensors become approved in clinical laborato-ries. Nevertheless, the unprecedented e orts devoted by the scienti c community allow for great optimism that this goal will be accomplished in the near future.
