But now, amid inevitable seasonal immune challenges and what 2020 and beyond taught us, a top question on your mind may be: What can I do to [bolster my immune system](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/all-natural-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system)? While there's [no real way to \"boost\" the immune system](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-boosting-your-immunity-really-means-tk-ways-to-do-it), there are definitely ways to support and strengthen immune cells and their critical functions. It's a daily process that requires tending to, well, every day. And it starts in the gut. \"Sixty to 80% of our [immune system is in our gut](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/md-explains-gut-health-immunity-connection) and is known as dietitian [Ella Davar, R.D., CDN](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/ella-davar-r-d-c-d-n), explains. In other words, more than half of the immune system lives in the digestive tract, so nurturing the gut microbiome is important. Certain foods also contain essential nutrients, like protein, antioxidants (think [vitamins C](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-vitamin-c-good-for-supplement-benefits-for-skin-and-more), E, and A, zinc, selenium, copper, etc.), fiber, and others which play specific roles in the immune system. \"That's why it is critical to focus on nutrition and the foods that we eat on a daily basis,\" Davar says. If you're finding it challenging to get enough of these vital immune-supporting nutrients through food alone, a high-quality supplement like [mindbodygreen's immune support+](https://shop.mindbodygreen.com/products/immune-support?itc_content=42647) can be a fantastic addition to your routine.* The daily formula is designed to help strengthen your body's natural defense mechanisms, featuring specific forms of the aforementioned nutrients that are easier for your body to absorb (think: vitamin D3, zinc bisglycinate, and ascorbic acid).* What's more, it includes [quercetin](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-quercetin) (a powerhouse antioxidant), as well as [beta-glucan](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/beta-glucan-benefits) (an immunomodulator thought to \"train\" the body's innate immune cells).* This type of supplement is a great option to ensure you're getting the support you need on a daily basis, to help nurture a healthy and resilient immune system.* As for specific foods to ensure your dietary pattern supports immunity, as well? Experts have some recommendations: Advertisement Fruits Citrus fruits Various citrus fruits\u2014including oranges, clementines, grapefruits, lemons, and limes\u2014contain high amounts of [vitamin C](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/vitamin-c-foods). Why is vitamin C important for the [immune system](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/3-foods-this-rd-loves-for-supporting-immunity)? \"It's this great antioxidant \"When we're exposed to so many people and so many viruses, getting a regular dose of vitamin C is incredibly helpful.\" How to use: A [bright citrus salad](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/this-roasted-halloumi-and-citrus-summer-salad-is-a-must), [gut-friendly citrus cocktail](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/3-ingredient-green-juice-cocktail-recipe), or solo as a snack (except for the lemon and lime, of course). Advertisement Papaya Papaya is another good source of vitamin C, with about [88.3 mg per cup](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169926/nutrients) [1](#citations), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food database. It also contains a [digestive enzyme](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/guide-to-digestive-enzymes) called papain, which helps break down proteins in the GI tract. This bioactive plant component helps [manage bloat](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-that-reduce-bloating) and [constipation to support overall gut](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23524622/) [2](#citations) health, according to research. As mentioned before, a healthy gut is directly tied to immune health. How to use: A [fruit smoothie](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/healthy-smoothie-recipes#:~:text=Belly%20Feel%2DGood%20Smoothie) or a [tropical chickpea bowl](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/indian-spiced-chickpea-recipe). and researcher [William Li, M.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/william-w-li-m-d), kiwis activate [all five health defense systems in the body](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-a-doctor-eats-to-prevent-and-fight-chronic-disease): angiogenesis, regeneration, the gut microbiome, DNA protection, and immunity. They also contain fiber, potassium, antioxidants, and about 75 mg of vitamin C. How to use: Blend into a [smoothie](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/immune-support-green-smoothie), eat on its own, or use to top yogurt. Advertisement Elderberry Studies have shown the liquid extracted from [elderberries](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/elderberry-tincture) may [support immune activity against infections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464619300313) [3](#citations). \"In general, elderberries are an excellent source of antioxidants, which help to maintain a strong immune system,\" functional medicine doctor [Tiffany Lester, M.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/dr-tiffany-lester), previously told mbg. \"Especially against viruses.\" How use: Take as a or [syrup](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/elderberry-syrup-benefits-recipes-and-why-you-should-take-it). Acai [Acai is rich in antioxidants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8036632/) polyphenols like flavonoids, Davar tells mbg. All of which have been shown to [protect against oxidative stress, and certain conditions](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants-in-depth), like cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and age-related neurodegenerative processes. \"Because these beneficial phytonutrients get cleared from the body quickly, it is important to consume plant foods daily for optimal health,\" she adds. How to use: An [acai breakfast bowl](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-a-healthy-acai-smoothie-bowl-with-coconut-chia-pudding-recipe). Advertisement Watermelon \"Watermelon is high in antioxidants, vitamins, and lycopene, which is [protective of heart health,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6470521/) [5](#citations)\" Davar says. It's also high in citrulline, which converts to nitric oxide in the body. This molecule has been shown to support endothelial function and [enhance athletic performance,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749691/) [6](#citations) according to one study. Plus, watermelon contains about 92% water, and adequate hydration is important for immune and overall health, especially in hot summer months. How to use: This [watermelon basil water](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/this-watermelon-basil-water-is-the-perfect-post-workout-drink), [grilled watermelon & pineapple salad](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/upgraded-fruit-salad-grilled-watermelon-and-pineapple-recipe), [grilled watermelon](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-grilled-fruits-how-to). And forget about the in carotenoids, particularly lycopene, has grown rapidly owing to studies suggesting a role in human health and disease,\" says one study in the journal Antioxidants. It contains anti-inflammatory properties that have benefited chemotherapy patients and people with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, the study authors write. Red peppers also contain plenty of vitamin C. One [medium bell pepper contains 152 mg](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/787812/nutrients) [8](#citations), compared to only [58.30 mg in one medium orange](http://www.ifrj.upm.edu.my/24%20(02)%202017/(37).pdf). How to use: In a [tomato shakshuka](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-best-ways-to-eat-roasted-red-peppers), on top of a sandwich, wrap, or salad, or mixed into a pasta dish. Broccoli According to [Kristine Gedroic, M.D.](https://www.gedroicmedical.com/gedroic-medical-home), author of A Nation of Unwell and integrative medicine doctor, broccoli is loaded with immune-boosting benefits. \"Not only is it rich in critical nutrients like vitamin C and zinc, but it also contains a natural chemical called sulforaphane that has been shown to boost the activity of key immune cells called T-cells and reduce inflammation in the body.\" Additionally, researchers identified a phytochemical called [3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) in broccoli](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070820175422.htm). This phytonutrient compound increases the levels of immune-regulating cytokines in the blood, she adds. How to & broccoli caesar salad](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/if-youre-going-to-make-caesar-salad-make-it-ina-gartens-kale-and-broccoli-version), a [side to crispy chicken](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/low-carb-crispy-chicken-recipe). Whatever you try, consider eating it cooked, as this increases the sulforaphane content. Spinach [Spinach](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/kale-vs-spinach) is a great source of vitamin K, but also antioxidants like beta-carotene (vitamin A) and lutein, [Maggie Moon, M.S., R.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/maggie-moon), previously told mbg. Similar to watermelon, spinach is also a hydrating food with about 90% water content, she adds. How to use: Blend into a [smoothie](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-a-mint-chocolate-smoothie-that-tastes-like-dessert), use as the [base of a salad](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/this-roasted-salmon-spinach-and-butternut-squash-salad-is-healthy-and-filling), or saut\u00e9 into a pasta or chickpea dish (just don't cook too long, as it retains most of its nutrients when fresh). Mushrooms [Mushrooms](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/types-of-mushrooms) are nutrient-dense veggies that work well in place of meat-based dishes. They have been studied for their [medicinal properties](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-immunologist-uses-fungi-to-fight-cold-and-flu), both when eaten or taken in tincture or supplement form. According to immunologist [Heather Moday, M.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/dr-heather-moday), mushrooms harbor antibacterial and antiviral properties naturally because they need them to survive in the wild. \"Some mushrooms are a rich source of [selenium, magnesium, and zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6176074/) [9](#citations), all of which may play a direct or indirect role in their anti-influenza properties,\" she adds. How to use: Replace meat in plant-based dishes, make [mushroom soup](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/immune-boosting-soup-recipes), saut\u00e9 with soy sauce and eat as a side or add to a stir-fry. Sweet potato Sweet potatoes are a great source of [vitamin A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6162863/) [10](#citations), which \"can enhance the organism's immune function and provide an enhanced defense against multiple infectious diseases,\" according to one study. Sweet potatoes are also high in [fiber](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/high-fiber-foods), which helps feed the microbes in the gut, supporting healthy digestion. How to use: Roast them, add to a smoothie, or make one of [these easy dinners](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-dinner-out-of-a-sweet-potato). Protein Almonds \"Most nuts are good for your health because they're rich in nutrients like [protein](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/which-nuts-have-most-protein), healthy fats and fiber,\" Gedroic says. But almonds, in particular, are rich in [vitamin E, which supports immune-enhancing T-cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266234/) [11](#citations), she explains. How to use: Snack on them, toast them to give a salad or rice pilaf some crunch. Poultry Both chicken and turkey are complete proteins, meaning they contain all nine [essential amino acids](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/essential-amino-acids-benefits), including histidine. Histidine contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown to protect against [chronic diseases](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/3/e020623). It also helps [activate histamine](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/10/1637/4575123) [12](#citations), which helps produce red and white blood cells\u2014both of which play a primary role in the immune system. When you're already sick, chicken soup usually hits the spot. Not only is it comforting, but one study found chicken soup may also contain anti-inflammatory properties that help [manage symptoms of respiratory infections](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11035691/) [13](#citations). How to use: Make [chicken soup](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/this-keto-chicken-and-dumpling-soup-recipe-is-comfort-in-bowl), roast chicken, or have a turkey or chicken sandwich. Shellfish \"Shellfish, especially oysters, are the best source of [immune-boosting zinc](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/4-zinc-rich-foods-to-add-to-your-diet), which also helps to balance blood sugar levels,\" Davar says. Just 3 ounces of cooked oysters provides 74 milligrams of zinc, according to the USDA. That equals 673% of your daily value (DV). How to use: On a salad, tossed in a pasta, or added to a seafood soup. Sunflower seeds Sunflower seed is a great source of healthy polyunsaturated fats and antioxidants like vitamins A and E, Davar says. They're also rich in magnesium, which helps promote [quality sleep\u2014a critical factor in immune health](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/sleep-and-immune-system) and [energy levels](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/foods-for-energy). important minerals supplied by sunflower seeds are [selenium](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/) [14](#citations), copper, and [zinc](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/zinc-rich-foods), which is directly linked to benefiting the immune system,\" she adds. How to use: Top smoothies, salads, or yogurts, or simply snack on them. Fermented foods Yogurt According to Gedroic, [fermented foods](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-fermented-foods-list), like [yogurt](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-to-know-about-yogurt), are some of the best foods to eat for overall health. \"Once in the gut, these bacteria produce antimicrobial compounds called antimicrobial peptides (or AMPs) that help to [fight bacteria, fungi, viruses, and infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722670/) [15](#citations),\" she says. \"As such, these compounds also seem to stimulate the immune system, which aids in its perpetual fight to stay healthy.\" She recommends looking for yogurt with live cultures, such as [Bifidobacterium](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/bifidobacterium-lactis-weight-loss-inflammation) and [Lactobacillus](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/acidophilus-probiotic-benefits). How to use: Top it with [homemade granola](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/simple-home-vegan-yogurt-and-granola-bowls-recipe) and berries, or add dill for a [cool dip](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/healthy-dip-recipes). Miso Miso is a fermented paste made from soybeans. The key word here is [fermented](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/guide-to-fermentation), which gives it similar gut and immune benefits as yogurt. Additionally, one study found miso soup consumption [lowered the heart rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313421/) [16](#citations) in Japanese adults, which may promote both [stress management and cardiovascular health](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health) [17](#citations). How to use: Eat as a [miso soup](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-vegan-seaweed-dashi-at-home); use the paste as a marinade for meat, [tempeh](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-tempeh-and-is-it-healthy), or [tofu](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/award-winning-chefs-recipe-for-homemade-tofu-sauce); add it to a stir-fry for extra umami flavor. Drinks Pomegranate juice [Pomegranates have been used medicinally](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671682/) [18](#citations) for centuries, mainly for their antibacterial properties. While several studies have demonstrated that pomegranate may [reduce viral infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8414858/) [19](#citations), many of them were conducted in vitro. More research is necessary in vivo to verify the antiviral qualities in pomegranate juice. Even so, neuroscientist and nutritionist [Lisa Mosconi, Ph.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/lisa-mosconi-ph-d), says pomegranate juice contains nearly the same amount of antioxidant polyphenols as red wine, which can [protect brain health](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/mediterranean-diet-for-brain-health) and cognitive function over the long-term. How to use: Drink on its own, freeze into ice cube trays and blend for a slushy, or freeze into an ice pop. Green tea [Green tea has potent anti-inflammatory bioactives](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27634207/) [20](#citations) (think catechins like EGCG), and the resolution of chronic inflammation is critical for immune and overall health. People who drink tea habitually (at least three times a week) tend to live longer, according to one study. The polyphenols in green tea help [protect the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986534/) [21](#citations), while the antibacterial properties disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911733/) [22](#citations) or bacteria. Additionally, \"the EGCG in green tea has been found to be [100 times more potent than the antioxidant power of vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519827) [23](#citations) and 25 times more than vitamin E,\" [Natalie Butler, RDN, L.D.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/natalie-butler), previously wrote for mbg. How to use it: [Sip it like tea](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-green-tea) (hot or iced), or take it as [a supplement](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/green-tea-extract-benefits-for-weight-loss-more). Water The amount of water to drink in a day varies by person, but across the board, adequate hydration is essential. \"Good [hydration is critical Roxanna for mbg. \"Mucous membranes, such as those in the mouth and nose, are the body's first line of defense against viruses. If they become dehydrated, they can't produce their moist coating, which prevents viruses and bacteria from adhering to tissue,\" they explain. How to use: [Drink plenty](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/benefits-of-drinking-water) throughout the day! Spices and herbs Turmeric a bioactive antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6835707/) [24](#citations). One study effects of curcumin on viruses](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/turmeric-may-have-antiviral-properties), like Zika, dengue virus, and hepatitis B. It's also been used to [treat inflammatory bowel conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3535097/) [25](#citations) like colitis and irritable bowel syndrome, making it great for the gut, registered dietitian [Jess Cording, M.S., R.D., CDN](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/jessica-cording), to take in a day](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-much-turmeric-should-you-take-per-day-experts-weigh-in) to experience the therapeutic effects. How to use: [Pair with black pepper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093167/) [26](#citations) to increase absorption, make [turmeric tea](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/golden-milk-recipes-and-benefits), or take in supplement form. Garlic Garlic can add flavor to almost any dish, and bonus: It has protective health benefits, too. \"This superfood has very strong antimicrobial and antiviral properties,\" Moday says. \"The potent sulfur compound allicin in garlic is known to help with GI infections such as [SIBO](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/sibo-guide) (small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth) and help [kill parasites and yeast infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6017524/) [27](#citations).\" How to use: At the sign of an infection, Moday recommends eating one raw garlic clove a day or taking a concentrated allicin extract. For everyday use, add to pasta dishes, [hummus bowls](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ethiopian-plant-based-meat-and-hummus-bowls), [pot roasts](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/recipe-for-vegan-pot-roast-garlic-and-wild-mushroom), or pretty much anything needing a savory kick. Ginger [Ginger](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/health-benefits-of-ginger-x-uses-for-ginger-root-tea-and-extract) contains diverse bioactive compounds, such as gingerols, shogaols, and paradols. These compounds have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial actions in the body. Ginger has also been shown to [help with headache, nausea, and cold symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616534/) [28](#citations). How to use: Make this [ayurvedic tea](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ayurveda-drinks-to-improve-digestion-and-boost-agni), add to a soup, take a ginger supplement. Bottom line. Supporting the [immune system](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/all-natural-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system) requires a holistic approach. Exercise, sleep, stress management, and, of course, proper hygiene all play a role. Still, diet is a vital tool for supporting your [overall immunity](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/supplements-for-immunity)\u2014and getting adequate immune-supporting nutrients is paramount.
