The first came in 1820, whentwo heavenly beings, later identified as Jesus and Godthe Father, appeared to Smith; one of them told himthat all of the many religious sects were wrong andforbade him to join any of them. In 1827, an angelgave him plates of gold engraved with holy scripturesnow known as the Book of Mormon. According to thetradition, Smith was ordained by John the Baptist onMay 15, 1829, and some time later by the Apostolicdisciples Peter, James, and John; his ordinationmarked the divinely authorized restoration of theApostolic Church, which was founded by Jesus Christand had died with the first generation of apostles. 1 Joseph Smith's leadership by revelation caused tur- moil within the Latter-day Saints church; membersclaiming revelations of their own caused a number ofschisms in the early days of the church. Today, twomajor churches from this tradition survive. The largest,with 5.2 million members in the United States as ofDecember 2000, is the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, or LDS church, headquartered in SaltLake City, Utah. The LDS church, commonly known asthe Mormon church, is one of the fastest growing reli-gions, showing dramatic growth in a combination of \"membership, market share, visibility, and/or impor-tance over the next few decades.\" 2The other major church, with about 250,000 members as of OctoberThe Latter-day Saints Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions Edited by Deborah Abbott Contents The Individual and the 5 Patient-Caregiver Relationship Family, Sexuality, and Procreation 6 Genetics 12 Organ and Tissue Transplantation 12 Mental Health 13 Death and Dying 14 Special Concerns 18 Part of the \"Religious Traditions and Healthcare Decisions\" handbook series published by the Park Ridge Center for the Study of Health, Faith, and Ethics THEPARKRIDGE CENTER THEPARKRIDGE CENTERDeborah Abbott, M.P.H., formerly with the Park Ridge Center, is currently with Georgia State University.2 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS2001, is the Community of Christ, formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter DaySaints (RLDS) church, headquartered inIndependence, Missouri. 3 The term \"Mormon\" is often used to refer to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Although \"Mormon\" is not an offensiveterm, most members prefer to be called \"Latter-daySaints.\" In referring to the Community of Christ(referenced here as \"Community\") or its members, one should not use the term \"Mormon.\" Membersof the Community of Christ refer to themselves as\"Saints\" or simply \"members.\" Both churches seek to distinguish themselves from the other. The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints claims to be unique in that eventoday its prophetic leadership continues to re-ceive and codify divine revelation. 4Meanwhile, the Community of Christ under its former namepublished the following statement: While the RLDS church and the LDS (or Mormon) church have some common features, such as a common historical beginning, there is no connec-tion between the groups. In fact, the paths taken bythe two have been so divergent since separation in1844 as to make the similarity in name at the pres-ent time inharmonious with religious faith andpractice . . . The RLDS and LDS are often incor-rectly seen as closely related in their theology andpractice by the uninformed observer. Often this as-sumption leads to the \"lumping together\" of thesegroups which is entirely inappropriate. The RLDS church has far more in common theologically with mainline Protestant churches than it does with theLDS church. Every attempt should be made by per- sons involved with both groups to clearly distin-guish between the two. This understanding will leadto much more effective ministry to both groups. 5 FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS CONCERNING HEALTH CARE LLDDSS::Latter-day Saints believe that both scien- tific and religious truths have their source inGod, and they see the two as necessarily com- plementary. As a result, Latter-day Saints aremore open to scientific and medical advancesthan many others in religious traditions thathave a deeply scriptural foundation. 6Latter-day Saints \"are encouraged to take full advantage ofmodern medicine and technology in the preven-tion and cure of sickness.\" 7Officially, the LDS church holds that \"members should not use medical or health practices that are ethically orlegally questionable. Local leaders should advisemembers who have health problems to consultcompetent professional practitioners who are li-censed in the countries where they practice.Bishops may not use fast offerings [charity]funds to pay for unproven medical care withoutFirst Presidency [high council] approval in eachcase.\" 8Part of this emphasis is perhaps a re- sponse to what seems to be an ongoing LDSproclivity to seek out herbal and naturopathiccures. This tendency is a vestige of official nine-teenth-century urgings that \"those with insuffi-cient faith to be healed should eschew orthodoxtreatments in favor of herbal remedies.\" 9 Not only does the LDS tradition respect med- ical science and technology, it also upholds aprofound respect for the moral integrity of per-sons within the healing professions. This is illus-trated most clearly by the fact that medicalprofessionals, rather than ecclesiastical officials,are often cited as the primary consultants incases of medical-moral perplexity. 10 Latter-day Saints have a reputation for foster- ing a tightly knit community that manifests itselfclearly when its members are sick or otherwisein need. Those who have significant illnesses areoften surrounded by a well-organized charitableeffort to provide practical, professional, and spir-itual support. 11 With regard to suffering, \"Latter-day Saints do not believe that pain is intrinsically good. In theirteaching there is little of asceticism, mortification,or negative spirituality. But when suffering is un-avoidable in the fulfillment of life's missions, one's challenge is to draw upon all the resourcesof one's soul and endure faithfully and well. Ifbenefit comes from pain, it is not because there is anything inherently cleansing in pain itself.\"12 CCoommmmuunniittyy::This church's world headquarters issued a short document titled \"HelpfulInformation for Health Care Professionals inMeeting the Spiritual Needs of Patients Who AreMembers of the Reorganized Church of JesusChrist of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church),\"which contains the following statement: The basic beliefs of the RLDS church pertaining to health and healing are simply stated: We believe in God as the source of love and life and truth,In Jesus Christ as the personal revelation of God,In the Holy Spirit as God's presence with and in us,In the human soul as body and spirit,In the ultimate health of salvation as perfectwholeness through divine grace,And in human freedom and agency with responsi-bility and accountability as divine gifts. IMPLICATIONS: The church believes that hu- mankind is endowed with freedom to choose toserve God or to reject God. Because free moralchoice is an important church doctrine, the church resists the imposition of any ecclesiastical restric-tion or proscription which limits a person's exerciseof this freedom. Preferably, medical decisions hav-ing moral implications will be made by the individ-ual and/or family in consultation with a physician, aqualified minister or priesthood member, profes-sional counselor, etc. These decisions should alwaysbe made in light of a full range of moral, legal, reli- gious, and cultural influences within which the per- sons live. The RLDS member faced with difficultand complex issues and decisions related to healthwill look to his/her faith as a resource and milieuin which such issues and decisions can be clarified.The individual's faith will provide support in his/her exercise of the freedom to choose, and thechurch will provide caring ministry in all circum- stances. Whether these issues are related to sexual-ity and procreation, passages of human life, healthcrisis, care of the dying and deceased, etc., the church does not pretend to give simple answers to complex and perplexing questions. Further, becausethere are no clear rules of conduct in every casewhich are dictated to persons faced by these situa-tions, the availability and intervention of a largearray of support/clarification services and personnelwill likely be welcomed and appreciated. 13 With regard to individual medical practices, the Community of Christ published the followingstatement: \"The moral evaluation of other spe-cific procedures, including new techniques madepossible through scientific advancement, will bemediated as necessary through the StandingHigh Council of the church, as the chief inter-preters of faith and doctrine in matters related tobiomedical ethics.\" 14 INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE LLDDSS::The role of authority in the LDS church is somewhat paradoxical. On the one hand, obedi-ence to church authority is strongly emphasizedin official church rhetoric 15and in the commu- nities of Latter-day Saints. On the other hand,the church actually has very few authoritativedoctrines and rarely takes official or formal posi-tions on social matters. 16The guidance offered to members of the LDS church on specific med-ical ethical issues arises from the \"central tenetsof the faith: the centrality of marriage and chil-dren; the overriding importance of maintainingfamily harmony and stability, and protecting thehealth and well-being of mother, children, and'tabernacles [children]-to-be;' the preservationof free agency and personal accountability; andthe total unacceptability of decisions based on'selfish' rationales.\" 17 Historically, the LDS church has been very slow to make statements concerning medicalethicalissues. Traditionally, the development of a position comes in several stages. First, the three-member First Presidency, the highest council of 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERthe church, responds privately to specific cases; much later it may make an official public state-ment on the issue; and then, if a different generalsocietal consensus emerges, it may modify the offi-cial statement so that it conforms with publictrends. Courtney Campbell, a prominent analyst ofLDS medical ethical thought, believes \"the LDS tradition will likely confront the emerging healthpolicy issues of contemporary bioethics with eccle-siastical silence and an affirmation of personal andprofessional responsibility.\" 18 For practical purposes, the LDS church has published periodically throughout this century aGeneral Handbook of Instructions that serves as the official manual of church policy and practices.The book includes information on such topics as church administration, performance of ordinances and rituals, and enforcement of church discipline;it also enumerates church positions on a varietyof medical and moral issues. It is available only toecclesiastical leaders and is designed to guidethem in leading members for whom they have re-sponsibility. 19However, the General Handbook does not and cannot address every situation,much less provide an \"answer.\" The teachings aretypically very brief, address specific practices, andfrequently carry no explicit scriptural referencesor explanatory justification. In addition to con-sulting official church positions, \"individualmembers of the LDS Church are understood tobe capable of receiving divine direction or revela- tion for their personal 'stewardships'\u2014the practi-cal problems encountered in daily life, inrelations with family members, or with other per-sons.\" 20Among the twenty-four health-related topics addressed in the General Handbook , nine include a clause indicating that the ultimate deci-sion-making authority rests with the parties in-volved; this is part of a trend toward, and in someways a reversion to, the attitude that God, ratherthan the church, should judge the morality ofsuch decisions. 21In the absence of a clear ecclesi- astical directive, difficult medical questionsshould be addressed from the standpoint of per-sonal moral agency and the prevailing profes-sional ethics of medicine. Persons involvedshould seek guidance from God and consult with their doctors, families, and ecclesiastical officials. CCoommmmuunniittyy::This church has been described as \"a theocratic democracy\u2014a government of Goddirected divinely 'common con-sent' of the people.\" 22Of all the churches with LDS heritage, it has been the one most open to the ideas of mainline Protestantism. In fact, thischurch often emphasizes its similarity to and con- nection with the major U.S. Protestant churches.The church gives very broad guidance to its members, rarely making categorical statements.There is, however, a body within the church structure known as the Standing High Councilthat gives consideration to moral and ethical is-sues, including certain bioethical questions. Thecouncil consists of twelve high priests, appointedby the First Presidency, who meet once a monthto study issues and develop statements of policy;the First Presidency sets the agenda based on itsunderstanding of what important issues face thechurch. The council's policy statements are pub- lished internally in a policies and proceduresmanual and are sometimes distributed to the full-time ministerial staff for guidance in counselingindividual church members. The church encour-ages individual members to rely on their ownconscience and has published the following state-ment about human agency: It is . . . a fundamental tenet of the church that humankind is endowed with freedom of choice toserve God or reject God, that persons cannot besaved in the Kingdom of God except by the graceof the Lord Jesus Christ, whose atonement givespersons the possibility of coming once more intoGod's presence . . . Because free moral choice is an important doctrine, based on the principle ofGod-given human agency, the church resists the imposition of any restrictions or policies limiting aperson's exercise of agency. However, there areimplied parameters of social expectations that aredeveloped within the church community that havetheir origins in Scriptural revelation, tradition, andpractice. 23 4 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSWhere an official ecclesiastical position has not been taken, the church holds that \"medicaldecisions having moral implications [should] bemade by the individual and/or family in consul-tation with a physician, a qualified minister orpriesthood member, professional counselor, etc. These decisions should always be made in light of a full range of moral, legal, religious, and cul-tural influences within which the persons live.\" 24 5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP Both the LDS church and the Community of Christ emphasize individual moral agency within the context of the religious community andbelief system; they do not use the secular term \"autonomy\" in their discourse because it impliesself-determination independent of God. The LDSchurch, in many of its medical ethics statements, places confidence specifically in the ability ofmedical care providers to resolve morally trouble-some medical situations, and the Community ofChrist, while silent on many specific medical pro-cedures, also trusts in the ability of those involvedto arrive at an appropriate decision. In resolvingdifficult situations, both churches place a strongemphasis on collective decision making ratherthan individual choice. Both would agree that it isthe patient who must make the final decisions re-garding his or her care but that the process of de-cision making should include family members,professional caregivers, friends, and in some in-stances ecclesiastical leaders. CLINICAL I SSUES Self-determination and informed consent LLDDSS::In the mid-1970s, the LDS church issued the following statement: \"The Church recog-nizes the need for carefully conducted and con-trolled experimentation to substantiate theefficacy of medicines and procedures. We be-lieve, however, that the free agency of the indi-vidual must be protected by informed consentand that a qualified group of peers should re-view all research to ascertain that it is needed,is appropriately designed and not harmful tothe person involved.\" 25Interestingly, the current General Handbook does not include references to experimental proce-dures, despite the prominent role played by theLatter-day Saints in early clinical trials of the artifi-cial heart. This omission may be explained by thefact that oversight by institutional review boards ofresearch using human subjects has been almostuniversally implemented in the United States. CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church recognizes and sup- ports the common-law right to self-determina-tion that has led to the doctrine of informedconsent to medical treatments. 26 Truth-telling and confidentiality LLDDSS::\"The LDS church always encourages hon- esty and truthfulness in all settings and situa-tions.\" 27The church has no official position on truth-telling dentiality in medical set- conscience,\" position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) Proxy decision making and advance directives LLDDSS::The LDS church, in a section of the General Handbook entitled \"Prolonging Life,\" supports the ability of family members to makedecisions regarding continuation of treatmentwhen \"dying becomes inevitable\" for a memberof the church. Such decisions should be madeafter consulting with appropriate medical person-nel and seeking divine guidance through prayerand fasting. The General Handbook does not ad- dress legal issues in this context and does not dis-cuss advance directives or living wills. 28Utah, theLDDSS::The LDS church and its membership are often noted for their very conservative and traditional views on family (including gen-der role attitudes and behavior), sexuality, andprocreation. A prominent teaching of the churchholds that adults are encouraged to marry andprovide temporal bodies, called \"tabernacles,\"for the spirit children of God so that these chil-dren may enter a loving family, grow, and betested on earth. 32 One unique doctrine of the LDS church is that couples whose marriages are \"sealed\" in a templeand who remain faithful will continue their mar-riage and continue to procreate in the afterlife. In addition, earthly children of parents whose mar-riage has been sealed may be sealed to their par- ents, thus immortalizing the family bonds. Many people wrongly associate polygamy, or plural marriage, with the modern-day LDSchurch. Polygamy was part of LDS practice only during the middle and late nineteenth century,and it provoked great hostility toward the Latter-day Saints. Church president Wilford Woodruffabolished the practice in 1890. Some smallsplinter groups still practice plural marriage, butthe larger church vigorously dissociates itselffrom this practice. The First Presidency issued a letter on \"Standards of Morality and Fidelity\" to all mem-bers of the LDS church on November 14, 1991, that said, in part: We call upon members to renew their commitment to live the Lord's standard of moral conduct.Parents should teach their children the sacred na- ture of procreative powers and instill in them adesire to be chaste in thought and deed. A correctunderstanding of the divinely appointed roles ofstate with the highest percentage of Latter-day Saints, does have a standard living-will statute.29 Under circumstances end-of-life de- cisions, that\"no unreasonable means\" are pro-long life. However, no substantive criteria fordetermining \"unreasonable means\" are given.This means that patients, their families, and physicians may interpret and apply this standarddifferently in various situations. 30 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The Standing High Council has stated: When family members must become surrogate de- cision-makers, they will function best if they arequalified to represent the patient's desires and havesome evidence regarding the nonautonomous pa-tient's previously held views. Such evidence cantake the form of a living will, an advance directive,or a durable power of attorney for health care. Thiscan be most helpful to family members and med-ical professionals as they make the actual deci-sions. Lacking such evidence, the surrogate has a responsibility to follow guidance principles whichhave received strong legal consensus in recentyears. One is the \"substituted-judgment\" standard,in which the patient's surrogate attempts to makethe decision that the individual, if competent,would choose. Another is the \"best interest\" stan-dard\u2014acting to best promote the good of the indi-vidual in terms of the relative balance of benefitsand burdens . . . Personal stewardship encompasses the responsibil- ity of individuals to think ahead to the kind of carethey may wish to receive at the end of their lives orafter they become incapable of deciding for them-selves. It greatly reduces the uncertainty and diffi-culty of treatment decisions if, sufficiently early inlife's journey, planning has begun for an advancedirective, a living will, or a durable power of attor-ney for health care. We place great value on the in-formed and reflective decision-making process inthis life. It is wise to use this process to deal withthe natural conclusion of life\u2014our own death. 31 6 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS HEALTHCARE DECISIONSFAMILY , AND PROCREATION7 THEPARKRIDGE fortify all against sinful prac- tices. Our only real safety, physically and spiritu-ally, lies in keeping the Lord's commandments. The Lord's law of moral conduct is abstinence outside of lawful marriage and fidelity within mar-riage. Sexual relations are proper only between husband and wife appropriately expressed withinthe bonds of marriage. Any other sexual contact,including fornication, adultery, and homosexualand lesbian behavior, is sinful. Those who persistin such practices or who influence others to do soare subject to Church discipline. 33 CCoommmmuunniittyy::Unlike the LDS church, this church has never accepted the idea that mar- riage covenants continue after death.34The church holds no unique positions on issues of family, sexuality, and procreation. However, oneof the few causes for dismissal from the churchis adultery. 35 CLINICAL I SSUES Contraception LLDDSS::Prior to 1989, the official position of the LDS church was to oppose artificial contracep- tion; however, actual practice often deviatedfrom this teaching. The statement on birth con-trol in the 1989 General Handbook represents a softening of previous policy against the use ofartificial birth control and implicitly accepts thata couple may, after prayerful consideration,space their children as may be best for theirfamily: \"Husbands must be considerate of theirwives, who have a great responsibility not onlyfor bearing children but also for caring for themthrough childhood . . . Married couples shouldseek inspiration from the Lord in meeting theirmarital challenges and rearing their children ac-cording to the teachings of the gospel.\" 36 In practice, the proportion of Latter-day Saints who use modern birth control methods at somepoint in their lives is the same as that of the na-tional population, 37around 96 percent, accordingto a 1975 survey. And although 1986 survey data indicated that the LDS birthrate was lower thanever, at around twenty births per thousand, LDSfamilies continue to have an average of one morechild than the average American family, as they have throughout this century. 38The consistently higher-than-average birthrate indicates that LDScouples tend to use artificial birth control moreas a means of spacing than of limiting their fami-lies. Apparently in LDS culture, family size is de-termined more by the encouragement to havechildren than by the discouragement from using artificial birth control. 39 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church holds that \"counseling on contraception as part of the stewardship oflife, is appropriate in whatever context it mightarise.\" 40 Sterilization LLDDSS::Sterilization as a means of birth control is viewed very differently by the LDS church thanare temporary methods of birth control\u2014it is\"seriously deplored.\" The statement on steriliza-tion (including vasectomy) that appears in the1989 General Handbook is consistent with past ecclesiastical teaching: 41 Surgical sterilization should only be considered (1) where medical conditions seriously jeopardizelife or health, or (2) where birth defects or serioustrauma have rendered a person mentally incompe-tent and not responsible for his or her actions.Such conditions must be determined by compe-tent medical judgment and in accordance with law.Even then, the person or persons responsible for this decision should consult with each other andwith their bishop . . . and receive divine confirma-tion through prayer. 42 CCoommmmuunniittyy::\"The church supports the perform- ance of medical procedures designed to accom-plish sterilization if, in the opinion of thephysician, and others qualified to judge, such aprocedure is in the best interest of the patient,the family, and/or society.\" 43New reproductive technologies LLDDSS::Given the LDS emphasis on reproduction in the context of marriage and the church's gen-eral acceptance of medical technology, one mightreasonably assume that the church would wel-come advances that allow otherwise infertile LDScouples to bear children. As a general matter, thechurch does accept such technologies for married couples, as long as the genetic link to both par-ents is assured. 44When gametes from third parties are introduced, however, the church discouragesthis use of technology. CCoommmmuunniittyy::This church's position is similar. The church supports the use of reproductive technologies in which the resulting child will begenetically linked to both parents. While otherarrangements are not considered \"immoral,\" thechurch advises caution, given the unpredictable social complications. Artificial insemination LLDDSS::The 1989 General Handbook states that artificial insemination by donor (AID) \"is it \"may seriously harmony . . . However, this is a personalmatter that ultimately must be left to the hus-band and wife, with the responsibility for the de-cision resting solely upon them . . . [Similarly,]donation of sperm is discouraged.\" 45The text does not directly address artificial inseminationby husband (AIH), but because it is distin-guished from AID and is not explicitly discour-aged, one may assume that it is acceptable. A unique consideration regarding salvation arises because of the Latter-day Saints' practice ofsealing for eternity the family bonds between hus-band and wife and between children and parents.The 1989 General Handbook states, \"A child con- ceived by artificial insemination and born after theparents are sealed in the temple is born in thecovenant. A child conceived by artificial insemina-tion before the parents are sealed may be sealedto them after they are sealed.\" 46This means that, with respect to their eternal salvation as membersof their families, children conceived through theuse of either AIH or AID are no different from children conceived through intercourse. 47 Absolutely no artificial insemination should be performed outside the context of a marriage. The1985 General Handbook states, \"The church dis- approves of artificial insemination of single sisters.Single sisters who deliberately refuse to follow thecounsel of their priesthood leaders in this regardwill be subject to disciplinary action.\" 48Further- more, a child cannot be sealed to only one parent,so the resulting child would remain unsealed. 49 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The policy of the Standing High Council, formulated in 1966, is this: On this subject the scriptures are silent. It is our opin- ion that when competent medical opinion has indi-cated that natural procreation is not possible, artificialinsemination may be used . . . so long as the donor isthe husband. We are inclined to say that A.I. by donorother than the husband, provided it is done with thehusband's consent, is not immoral; still, because ofthe unresolved legal, sociological and psychologicalimplications A.I. or IVF [in vitro fertilization] by otherthan the husband is not recommended by the church. Gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer (GIFT) LLDDSS::No official LDS position on GIFT exists. Given the LDS positions on AIH and AID, how-ever, GIFT would likely be acceptable if awoman's own egg was implanted in her fallopiantube along with the sperm of her husband. OtherGIFT arrangements would probably be discour- aged but left to the discretion of the couple. CCoommmmuunniittyy::No official church position on GIFT exists. Given this church's positions on AIH andAID , however, GIFT would likely be acceptable if a woman's own egg was implanted in her fallop-ian tube along with the sperm of her husband.As long as both husband and wife consent, thechurch would not view other GIFT arrangements as immoral but would not recommend them. In vitro fertilization (IVF) LLDDSS::Consistent with the LDS stances on AIH 8 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERand AID, the LDS policy on IVF, first articulated in 1989, states: \"In vitro fertilization usingsemen other than that of the husband or an eggother than that of the wife is strongly discour-aged. However, this is a personal matter that ulti-mately must be left to the judgment of thehusband and wife. A child conceived through invitro fertilization after parents are sealed in thetemple is born in the covenant. Such a childborn before parents are sealed in the temple may be sealed to them after they are sealed.\" 50The fact that the term \"strongly\" appears with refer-ence to IVF but not artificial insemination sug-gests that IVF may be more morally problematic.The statement does not elaborate the specific ob- jections, but these may include the fact that IVFoften involves freezing and eventually destroyingunneeded embryos as well as selectively abortingfetuses in cases of multiple pregnancy. The issueof when a fetus receives its soul (and thereforewhen it becomes a \"person\") is nonetheless stillunsettled in the LDS tradition; because of this,personal discretion may be appropriate on thispoint. 51(See section on abortion below.) CCoommmmuunniittyy::See the artifi- cial insemination above. Surrogate motherhood LLDDSS::The LDS statement on surrogate mother- hood is very simple, straightforward, and sur-prisingly mild. \"Surrogate motherhood isdiscouraged. It and commer- cial surrogacy are not distinguished. Surrogate arrangements involving artificial in- semination may entail specific difficulties forLatter-day Saints, particularly for married surro-gates. If the surrogate mother is single, the artifi-cial insemination itself will not be approved. If thesurrogate mother is married and has been sealedto her husband, she, rather than the \"adoptive\"mother, will be sealed for eternity to the child in-volved; under current LDS policy, no provisionexists for breaking this bond so that the child maybe sealed to his or her adoptive parents. 53CCoommmmuunniittyy:: No official position exists on surro- gate motherhood. However, given its positionson AIH and AID , the church would not recom- mend surrogate arrangements because of thepotential legal, sociological, and psychologicalcomplications. Arrangements in which the childis genetically related to only one member of thecouple would be less desirable than those inwhich the child is the offspring of both parents. ABORT ION AND THE STATUS OF THE FETUS LLDDSS::The following statement was published in the newspaper Deseret News on January 19, 1991, under the heading \"LDS Position onAbortion,\" and the text was incorporated intothe October 1991 revision of the Supplement to the General Handbook of Instructions : In view of the widespread public interest in the issue of abortion, we reaffirm that The Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has consistently opposed elective abortion. More than a century ago,the First Presidency of the Church warned againstthis evil. We have repeatedly counseled peopleeverywhere to turn from the devastating practice ofabortion for personal or social convenience. The Church recognizes that there may be rare cases in which abortion may be justified\u2014cases involvingpregnancy by incest or rape; when the life or healthof the woman is adjudged by competent medicalauthority to be in serious jeopardy; or when thefetus is known by competent medical authority tohave severe defects that will not allow the baby tosurvive beyond birth. But these are not automaticreasons for abortion. Even in those cases, the cou-ple should consider an abortion only after consult-ing with each other, and their bishop, and receivingdivine confirmation through prayer. The practice of elective abortion is fundamentally contrary to the Lord's injunction, \"Thou shalt notsteal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor doanything like unto it\" (Doctrine and Covenants 59:6). We urge all to preserve the sanctity of humanlife and thereby realize the happiness promised tothose who keep the commandments of the Lord. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as an institution has not favored or opposed specificlegislative proposals or public demonstrations con-cerning abortion. Inasmuch as this issue is likely to arise in all states in the United States of America and in manyother nations of the world in which the Church isestablished, it is impractical for the Church to takea position on specific legislative proposals on thisimportant subject. However, we continue to encourage our members as citizens to let their voices be heard in appropri-ate and legal ways that will evidence their belief inthe sacredness of life. 54 With regard to circumstances in which abortion may be justified because of a risk to the mother'shealth (second paragraph), \"no differentiation ismade in formal policy as to whether 'health'should be given a narrow (physiological) or broad(psychological and physiological) interpretation,though the context of earlier policy statements, aswell as the ongoing procedural stipulation that in-dications of life or health as reasons for abortionmust be confirmed by medical professionals, maytilt the balance towards a more objective, physio-logical understanding of 'health.' Here again, how-ever, the silence of the text on this point leavesopen the possibility of practical flexibility.\" 55 Even in the \"rare cases in which abortion may be justified,\" it is not necessarily appropriate. Couples considering abortion under these circum-stances are expected to consult both each otherand the local ecclesiastical authority, and after theyhave made the decision to abort, they are expectedto \"receiv[e] divine confirmation through prayer.\" 56 The statement quoted above, a reaffirmation of LDS policy, was published in the midst of a heated debate in Utah surrounding a proposedabortion bill that would have prohibited abortion except under the three conditions outlined inLDS policy. This bill did pass the Utah state legis- lature but was later judged to be unconstitution-al. 57The law would have dramatically reduced the number of abortions performed annually in Utah,currently about 5,000. The Utah abortion rates(number of abortions per the number of womenof childbearing years) and ratios (number ofabortions divided by the number of live births)are half or less than half the national average,though the same rates and ratios as calculatedduring the first eight weeks of pregnancy havebeen higher than the national average. 58 Interestingly, the LDS church does not equate abortion with murder. Unlike other churches,the LDS church has never formally addressedthe issue of when life begins and therefore doesnot argue against abortion on the grounds that itdestroys a human life. When LDS leaders havediscussed the \"ensoulment\" of the fetus, theyhave often set it at the time of \"quickening\"(movement detectable by the mother), but oth-ers have assumed ensoulment to occur at birth.These discussions represent doctrinal specula- tion, not official church positions. The fact that abortion is not equivalent to mur- der is illustrated by the difference in ecclesiasticalsanctions associated with each. \"Disciplinary ac-tion, including excommunication, may be appliedto any Latter-day Saint who encourages, performs,or submits to an abortion; the scope of the sanc-tion thus applies to family members and physi-cians as well as to pregnant women. At the sametime, those disciplined may undergo a period andprocess of repentance and receive forgivenessfrom ecclesiastical authorities, a practice that pre-supposes a distinction between abortion and thetaking of innocent human life.\" 59According to LDS scripture, murderers \"shall not have forgive- ness in this world, nor in the world to come.\"60 CCoommmmuunniittyy::In contrast the following excerpt is from the \"Statement on Abortion\" (January 24,1974, reaffirmed in 1980) by the Standing HighCouncil that \"support[s] the legality of abortion 10 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERand the right of a woman to make her own deci- sion in the matter. It also emphasize[s] themoral importance of the decision and the needto live in ways which would minimize the needfor such decisions.\" 6. We affirm the inadequacy of simplistic answers that regard all abortions as murder or, on theother hand, regard abortion only as a medical pro-cedure without moral significance. 7. We affirm the right of the woman to make her own decision regarding the continuation or termi- nation of problem pregnancies. Preferably this de-cision should be made in cooperation with hercompanion and in consultation with a physician,qualified minister, or professional counselor. Thisdecision should be made in light of the full rangeof moral, medical, legal, and cultural influenceswithin which the person lives. 8. We affirm the need for skilled counselors to be accessible to the membership of the church to as-sist persons in their struggle with issues centeringin human sexuality, responsible parenthood, andwholeness of family life. There is a need forchurch leaders to be cognizant of counseling re- sources within the community to which our mem-bers may be referred. 61 In this statement the Council also asserts: Church leaders recognize that there may be rare occasions which might make it necessary, becauseof the conditions of the conception or the preg-nancy, to terminate a particular pregnancy. Yet forpurposes of teaching children and young peoplewhat we consider to be moral principles and thelaw of the church, these teachings must includeplacing a high value on the preservation of life andproscribe the use of abortion as a means of merelyterminating an unwanted pregnancy or as an alter-native method of contraception. Just as surely asthe church must stand for the sanctity of marriageand forbid adultery and fornication, so must it alsostand against any practice which would seem toweaken marriage or promote immorality. We feel the emphasis should be placed on the teaching ofvalues and moral guidelines which accent the posi-tive worth of chastity before marriage, fidelitywithin marriage, and a reverence for life asChristian principles. If a termination of the preg-nancy is chosen, those who share the burden ofmaking the choice must assume responsibility forthis act of agency. 62 PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT LLDDSS::The LDS church has no official position on prenatal diagnosis and treatment as such,but, given the fact that abortion may be justifiedin cases where severe deformity is detected in utero , it is safe to assume that prenatal diagnosis under some circumstances is acceptable. Suchcases might include a family history of geneticdisease or other negative medical indications. Incases in which no risk is apparent, amniocente-sis may not be appropriate. CCoommmmuunniittyy::No position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) CARE OF SEVERELY HANDICA PPED NEWBORNS LLDDSS::LDS ecclesiastical policy has not directly addressed the issue of selective treatment of im-paired newborns. Because of the LDS emphasison the transformational (rather than the termi-nal) nature of death and the belief in ultimatejustice for the handicapped, one might expectLDS policy to lean toward a presumption in favor of nontreatment, assuming prayerful con-sideration and appropriate medical understand-ing on the part of those involved in decisionmaking. In practice, however, most LDS familieschoose to prolong life in such cases. 63 CCoommmmuunniittyy::No position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.)Both the LDS church and the Community of Christ accept the pursuit of knowledge re- garding human genetics, provided that suchknowledge is not used in what they consider im-moral ways. Neither church has made explicitwhere it would draw the line between moral andimmoral, however, and the Community of Christchurch is likely to be more liberal in its al- lowances than the LDS church. CLINICAL I SSUES Genetic screening and counseling Neither church has taken a position on this issue. (See \"Institutional authority and individ-ual conscience,\" above.) Sex selection LLDDSS::The LDS church opposes all genetic test- ing for sex selection. CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church opposes sex selection if abortion is involved but may permit it if the se-lection is done prior to implantation in cases ofassisted reproduction. Selective abortion LLDDSS::\"Interestingly enough, the First Presidencynever has specifically condemned the termination of pregnancies involving seriously defective fe-tuses.\" 64One 1983 estimate indicated that, in practice, two-thirds of Utah pregnancies with ge-netic abnormalities were terminated (versus about80 percent nationally). 65A couple facing a deci- sion to terminate any pregnancy, however, shouldseek consultation with a local church leader andprayerful consideration. (See section on abortion.) CCoommmmuunniittyy:: The church affirms \"the right of the woman to make her own decision regardingthe continuation or termination of problempregnancies.\" (See section on abortion.) Gene therapy LLDDSS::Bioethicist Courtney Campbell knows of no policies that have ever been developed con-cerning issues in genetic engineering. 66Lester Bush, a Latter-day Saint who has written exten-sively on medical ethics issues in the LDSchurch, has said, \"to the extent that [the use of genetic engineering] is limited to the treatmentof disease, I really cannot conceive of a pre-dictable rationale for Mormon objections to thisamazing new tool.\" 67 CCoommmmuunniittyy::No position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) 12 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATIONGENETICS LDDSS:: The LDS church is distinctive in its em- phasis on the importance of the body for salvation; the body is seen \"as an essential partof the soul.\" 68Latter-day Saints believe that sal- vation and eternal life with Jesus Christ requirethat one experience bodily life on earth. Thebody is considered a \"temple\" or \"tabernacle\" of God and is to be treated as such; Latter-daySaints are explicit in their prohibitions againstthe use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, illegaldrugs, and other potentially harmful substances. (See \"Special Concerns\" below.) CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church holds that at the resur- rection, people will be given spiritual bodies,the characteristics of which are not now known.Saints recognize that earthly bodies perish butthat part of each person lives on after death.\"The persisting 'being' of a person, described as'the spirit,' does not reside in the grave. This13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERbelief is emphasized in a scripture, unique to Saints, that states, 'the spirits of all men, as soonas they are departed from this mortal body . . .are taken home to that God who gave them life'(Alma 19:44, Book of Mormon).\" 69 CLINICAL I SSUES Recipient issues LLDDSS::The 1989 General Handbook states, \"The decision to receive a donated organ should bemade with competent medical counsel and con-firmation through prayer.\" 70 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church holds no specific posi- tion but would view the decision to receive do-nated organs or tissues as, ultimately, anindividual decision. Donor issues (a) Procurement from cadaveric and living donors LLDDSS::The 1989 General Handbook states: \"Whether an individual chooses to will his ownbodily organs or authorizes the transplant of or- gans from a deceased family member is a decisionfor the individual or the deceased member's fam-ily.\" 71Latter-day Saints are entirely free to donate organs under appropriate medical protocols and toserve as living donors for family members. 72CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church holds no specific posi- tion but would probably view the decision to do-nate organs as an individual decision or, in casesin which the individual's desires are not known,a family decision. (b) Procurement from anencephalic newborns and human fetuses LLDDSS::The LDS church has taken no official po- sition on the procurement of organs and tissuesfrom anencephalic newborns and human fe-tuses. Because earthly embodiment is necessaryfor salvation in LDS theology, procurement fromliving human fetuses (which do not yet haveearthly bodies) would not be acceptable becauseit would interfere with their eternal progression.Children with severe deformities that makethem unaccountable for their actions or causeneonatal death, such as anencephaly, arethought to be specially chosen by God and needonly have a body in order to be saved. Becauseof this, procurement from such children may beacceptable, provided the action does not hastendeath. In all cases, medical, ecclesiastical, andfamilial consultation and prayer should informthe decision to procure tissues or organs. CCoommmmuunniittyy::No position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) MENTAL HEALTH LDDSS::During the nineteenth century, Latter- day Saints often attributed extreme forms of mental illness to possession by demons and evilspirits. 73With the turn of the century came an increasing emphasis on scientific medicinewithin the church and a corresponding evolutionin LDS attitudes toward mental health. Today,while a trace of their former attitudes remains,Latter-day Saints hold typical beliefs about thecauses and treatments of mental illness. 74CCoommmmuunniittyy::No unique position on mental health. CLINICAL I SSUES Involuntary commitment Neither church has taken a position on this issue. (See \"Institutional authority and individual con-science,\" above.)14 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSDEATH AND DYINGPsychotherapy and behavior modification LLDDSS::The 1985 General Handbook section on counseling states: Church members who have problems or questions that trouble them should make a diligent effort, in-cluding earnest prayer, to find solutions and answersthemselves. If they need help, they are to consultfreely with their bishops and receive from them thecounsel they need. If members call, visit, or write toChurch headquarters about intimate personal mat-ters, they deprive themselves of a great blessing. The Church makes a bishop, who is a spiritual ad- viser and temporal counselor, accessible to everymember. He should know his members well andshould understand the circumstances that causetheir problems. These local leaders are, by theirordination or setting apart, entitled to a heavenlyendowment of the discernment and inspirationnecessary to advise those who seek help. 75 In addition to this formal statement on the role of priesthood members in pastoral care, a num-ber of themes have been expressed both offi- cially and unofficially with regard to the rolesand duties of psychotherapists. These have beensummarized thus: First, psychotherapists are advised that to be suc- cessful in their field, they themselves must live byand be actively involved in the Mormon gospel (andput LDS gospel values and inspiration through the Holy Ghost above professional dicta). Second, theyshould bring their clients to repentance (thus im-plying, in many cases, an ultimate goal of sendingthose who have sinned to their bishop where guiltand repentance can be worked through). And,third, they should help their clients acquire tradi-tional values. Implicit in the foregoing counsel, ofcourse, is an emphasis on sin, guilt, repentance, andrighteous living as key factors in mental health, and thereby, the treatment of mental illness. 76 CCoommmmuunniittyy::No position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) Psychopharmacology LLDDSS:: \"Psychoactive medications seem never to have thechurch . . . Given . . . the assumption that an in- dividual is in the hands of a professional quali-fied to prescribe medications, there have beenno expressed leadership objections to the judi-cious use of tranquilizers, antidepressants, an-tipsychotics, or related drugs.\" au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) Electroshock and stimulation Neither church has taken a position concerningelectroshock and stimulation. (See \"Institutional authority and individual conscience,\" above.) LDDSS::According to LDS theology, at the time of death, the spirit of a person separates from his or her body and returns to God, the giver oflife. The spirits of the righteous rest in paradisewhile the spirits of the wicked face the wrath ofGod. Personal identity is eternal, and the virtuous reunite with friends and family. At the time of theresurrection, the spirits of all persons, regardlessof their righteousness, will be eternally reunitedwith perfect and incorruptible bodies. Because of these beliefs about the afterlife, the end of life onearth may be seen more as a transition, often tobetter things, than as a final loss. Still, death is not taken lightly, and grief is quite natural amongLatter-day Saints in the face of such a loss. 78 CCoommmmuunniittyy::Saints believe that when a person dies, his or her spirit goes \"home\" to God andthat, at the resurrection, all persons will receive a spiritual body. (See the introduction to \"Organand Tissue Transplantation\" above.) CLINICAL I SSUES Determining death Neither the LDS church79nor the Community has addressed the issues of defining death anddetermining when death has occurred. Pain control and palliative care Neither church has taken a position on pain control or palliative care. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual life-sustaining treatment LLDDSS::The 1989 General Handbook states: When severe illness strikes, Church members should exercise faith in the Lord and seek compe-tent medical assistance. However, when dying be-comes inevitable, it should be looked upon as ablessing and a purposeful part of an eternal exis-tence. Members should not feel obligated to extendmortal life by means that are unreasonable. Thesejudgments are best made by family members afterreceiving wise and competent medical advice andseeking divine guidance through fasting and prayer. 80 This statement represents an opening to the possibility of withdrawing life-sustaining medicalcare; previous statements required that churchmembers ask medical care providers \"to assist inreversing conditions that threaten life.\" 81 Courtney Campbell has enumerated three themes in LDS theology that shape thinking onthe issue of whether or when to withhold orwithdraw medical treatment: 1. The Sovereignty of God. A theological presump- tion in favor of life is established by the dominionof the Deity over life and death. Life is a funda-mental, though not absolute, good; death is neitherto be sought nor seen as an ultimate enemy . . .2. The Stewardship of Human Beings. Since human beings are created in God's image, theirrelationships always presuppose a radical sense ofboth dependence and equality. There is no funda- mental moral discontinuity between the dying per-son in the bed and the caregiver at the bedside;what they hold in common is more significantthan the fact of illness that separates them . . . 3. Moral Agency . . . The principle of free agency in the LDS tradition requires respect for the self-determined decisions and choices of others . . . Atthe same time, a responsible choice will be theoutcome of a collaborative procedure, in whichpatients, family members, and medical caregivers,but not necessarily ecclesiastical authorities, areimportant participants. These theological principles form the context for positions in the LDS tradition on the terminationof treatment that (a) establish a general presump-tion in favor of utilizing available medical technol-ogy to sustain life, (b) permit forgoing medicalinterventions in some instances to allow a patientto die, and (c) prohibit assisted suicide and activeeuthanasia in all situations. 82 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church supports the right of all persons to refuse life-sustaining treatment basedon the principle of self-determination. 83It also: supports the patient's right to execute a living will indicating that no resuscitation be attempted in thecase of specified circumstances. It further supportsthe concept that the family, in the absence of suchindication by the patient and in case the patient isunable to indicate his or her wish for whateverreason, has the right to request no resuscitation ifin their judgment the condition is hopeless, pro-vided such indicated order is legal in the state inwhich the hospital is licensed. 84 In cases in which family members must act as surrogate decision makers, the church recog-nizes that: 15 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER16 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSthere will be disagreements among conscientious persons. Mindful of this, we counsel those involvedto remember that the decision to allow a person todie is not the moral equivalent of causing the personto die, and may be an expression of trust in the careof a loving God. All parties to these difficult deci-sions can find in them opportunities for understand-ing, acceptance and forgiveness rather than blameor guilt. Confronting the mystery of death can leadto a fuller appreciation of our faith in eternal life. 85 Suicide, assisted suicide, and active euthanasia LLDDSS::For much of its history, the LDS church viewed suicide as murder of the self and, on thegrounds that it constituted \"shedding of inno- cent blood,\" strongly condemned it. Like mur-der, suicide was viewed as a sin that wouldprevent the person from receiving eternal bless-ings and rewards after death. Now, a more mer-ciful stance is adopted toward those who commitsuicide: determination of responsibility and guiltis thought to rest in God's hands. The 1989General Handbook represents the change in pol- icy 86and states, \"A person who takes his own life may not be responsible for his acts. OnlyGod can judge such a matter. A person who has considered suicide seriously or has attemptedsuicide should be counseled by his bishop andmay be encouraged to seek professional help.\" 87 If a member in good standing of the LDS church commits suicide, normal procedures are followed for the funeral and for the disposal ofthe body. 88 In contrast to its positions on suicide and most other bioethical matters (which have be-come gradually more liberal), LDS opposition toeuthanasia has become increasingly rigid. The1989 General Handbook states, \"A person who participates in euthanasia\u2014deliberately puttingto death a person suffering from incurable con-ditions or diseases\u2014violates the commandmentsof God.\" 89 The statement makes no moral distinction be- tween those who have merciful intentions andthose who do not, nor does it distinguish volun-tary active euthanasia from unrequested active euthanasia. Thus it focuses not on motivation butrather on the deed itself. No ecclesiastical sanc-tions are discussed, however, indicating that eu-thanasia may not be the moral equivalent of\"shedding of innocent blood,\" an unpardonablesin 90that denies one the blessings of exaltation.91 Most recently, the LDS church has opposed a ballot measure in Oregon allowing physician-as-sisted suicide on the basis that it \"is contrary tothe Lord's direction in ( Doctrine and Covenants 59:6).\" 92 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church clearly distinguishes between passive and active euthanasia, allowing the former under certain circumstances andcondemning the latter: The act of putting to death painlessly a person suffering from an incurable disease has tradition-ally been called euthanasia. It entails causingdeath to occur. The Standing High Council, alongwith the preponderance of religious, medical andlegal opinion, opposes acts of what is now com-monly referred to as \"active euthanasia.\" This op-position extends to situations in which the patientrequests death at the hands of family members,medical personnel, or others. Allowing death to occur, on the other hand, may involve the withholding or withdrawing of life-sus-taining medical treatment in circumstances wheredeath is the natural outcome. We recognize thatthere are circumstances where it is more appropri-ate to allow individuals to die than to artificiallykeep their bodies alive. Allowing death to occur ispermissible when death is the inevitable and natu-ral outcome and the measures required to post-pone it would rob the patient of the ability torelate meaningfully to others or to experience sat-isfaction with the quality of his or her existence.Such measures include artificially assisted nutri-tion and hydration. 93Autopsy and postmortem care LLDDSS:: \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds that an autopsy may be performedif the family of the deceased gives consent and ifthe autopsy complies with the law of the com-munity.\" 94 CCoommmmuunniittyy::No position. (See \"Institutional au- thority and individual conscience,\" above.) Last rites, burial, and mourning customs LLDDSS::Modern LDS funerals are, for the most part, fairly simple and \"expressive of hope, lifeand resurrection.\" 95 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints counsels its members to bury their dead in theearth to return dust to dust, unless the law of thecountry requires cremation. However, the decisionwhether to bury or cremate the body is left to thefamily of the deceased, taking into account anylaws governing the matter. Burial of the body usu-ally follows a funeral or graveside service. Thebody of a deceased member of the Church who has received the temple endowment should bedressed in temple clothing. Relief society sistersdress deceased women, and priesthood brethren[dress] the men. When it is not possible to clothethe body, temple clothing may be laid over it. A member of the bishopric typically presides at the burial, where a simple, earnest prayer is of-fered to dedicate the grave, with blessings prom-ised as the Spirit dictates. This prayer may includea dedication of the grave as a sacred resting placeuntil the resurrection if the person giving theprayer holds the Melchizedek priesthood and hasbeen asked to give such a dedication. The grave site often becomes a sacred spot for the family ofthe deceased to visit and care for. 96 CCoommmmuunniittyy::According to the Priesthood Manual , the church does \"not believe that the form of the service has any bearing on the eter-nal well-being of the deceased.\"97Neither do members believe that a person's body is essen-tially himself; a person's spirit continues withGod while the mortal body decays. However, the church recognizes the needs of the living friends and family of the deceased: Our deepest feelings prompt us to provide some kind of visible symbol to express the love we haveexperienced and the bonds of unity we haveforged when death separates us. In most instances,as those who remain, we will value some signifi-cant location where the lasting value of our rela-tionships can be symbolized. This may take theform of burial of the body, with some form ofmonument. Alternatively, survivors may arrangefor the cremation of the body and the provision ofsome kind of living plant, plaque or other sym-bolic expression. 98 Stillbirths LLDDSS:: The LDS church has acknowledged the potential ambiguities associated with stillbirths: Although temple ordinances are not performed for stillborn children, no loss of eternal blessings orfamily unity is implied. The family may record thename of a stillborn child on the family grouprecord followed by the word stillborn in parenthe- ses. Memorial or graveside services may or maynot be held as determined by the parents. 99 CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church does not have a formal, written position on stillbirths. [Church members] practice a believers baptism. This leads . . . members to understand that the death of a young child, although tragic andpainful, does not raise concerns about . . . salva-tion. Funeral or memorial services are often con-ducted for children who are stillborn, and thesetypically take their form from the needs and de-sires of the family. 100 17 THEPARKRIDGE CENTER18 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSDiet and drugs LLDDSS::All members of the LDS church in good standing are to adhere to an 1833 revelation toJoseph Smith called the Word of Wisdom. This \"commandment\" proscribes the use of wine,strong drinks, tobacco, and hot drinks, andcommends the use of \"wholesome herbs,\" flesh(to be used sparingly), grain, and fruit for thehealth and well-being of the Saints. 101Similarly, members \"should not use any substance thatcontains illegal drugs or other harmful or habit-forming ingredients.\" 102 Latter-day Saints recognize that spiritual health as well as physical health is at stakewhenever substance abuse is occurring. Abuseand addiction often limit personal agency, and,because the proper use of personal agency is so vital to salvation in LDS theology, Latter-daySaints should strive to avoid substance abuse ofall kinds. 103 CCoommmmuunniittyy::While the Word of Wisdom (see above) is part of the scripture of the church, it isnot interpreted in a strictly prescriptive way.Rather, the Word of Wisdom \"counsels personsto see that their personal behavior does not de-tract from their physical well-being. It suggeststhat we should eat wisely and rest adequately. Itsuggests that the abusive use of substances suchas alcohol and tobacco may impair our health tothe point where we are less able to serve God... We are advised to avoid experimentation with or addiction to harmful substances and toadhere to strict moral principles.\" 104 Undergarments LLDDSS::Latter-day Saints who have been \"en- dowed\" in a temple ceremony (have committedthemselves to God and the LDS church) are ex-pected to wear a temple undergarment as a re-minder of their covenants and as a protector ofmodesty. Hospitalized Latter-day Saints maychoose not to wear their garment if a gown is more appropriate. 105CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church has no requirements for undergarments or other special clothing. Pastoral care in medical settings LLDDSS::The LDS church sponsors home and visit- ing teachers for the welfare of every family andmember of the church. Thus each member hasa home teacher with responsibilities for pastoralcare in medical settings. The home teachersmake regular hospital visits and, when re-quested by a patient or his or her family, mayoffer special prayers for the welfare of the pa-tient, perform the priesthood blessing of anoint-ing the sick, or administer the sacrament of theLord's Supper. Female LDS patients may receiveadditional pastoral care from visiting teachers.Hospital rules and pastoral staff should makeprovision for the ministrations of home or visit-ing teachers for LDS patients. CCoommmmuunniittyy::The church has offered the follow- ing guidance to pastoral staff who may servemembers: Insofar as the religious care of patients is con- cerned, patients are free to request the services oftheir own pastor or receive the denominational min-istry provided through the hospital chaplain staff.These services include short-term pastoral counsel- ing, administering the sacraments, and prayers ofpetition and intercession. The church has no spe-cific times at which administering the sacraments ofbaptism, holy communion, or anointing and layingon hands for the sick is required. Provision for theseministerial services should be made, however, andno hospital rules or policies should interfere withtheir being performed with grace and dignity. 106 RELIG IOUS OBSERVANCES Baptism LLDDSS:: \"Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins\" is a central article of faith in LDS teaching.SPECIAL CONCERNS19 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERHowever, LDS children are not baptized until they reach the \"year of accountability,\" defined aseight years old. Before that age, they are pre-sumed not to have the knowledge and accounta-bility necessary to sin against God. Those who diebefore the age of accountability will receive all the rewards of those who lived long enough to bebaptized. Therefore, neonatal baptisms are un-necessary and, in fact, inappropriate. 107The men- tally retarded (those with mental ages less thaneight years) are also considered incapable of sinbecause of their lack of knowledge and therefore need not be baptized. 108 CCoommmmuunniittyy:: As in the LDS church, baptismal candidates must be at least eight years old, andparents must give consent if the candidate is achild. Baptism by complete immersion is the only recognized mode, and it is valid only whenthe candidate and officiating minister are bothin the water. 109Baptism is never observed in the hospital setting.110 Blessing of the sick LLDDSS:: There is no rite in the LDS church com- parable to \"last rites.\" However, nonsacramentalblessings of the sick are regularly performed 111 and are based on the biblical injunction \"If anyone of you is ill, he should send for the elders ofthe church, and they must anoint him with oilin the name of the Lord and pray over him. Theprayer of faith will save the sick man and theLord will raise him up again. . .\" (James5:14-15). While the purpose of blessing the sickis to summon divine assistance in the healing ofan afflicted person, the manifestations of \"divineassistance\" are many. Healing may occur as a re-sult of direct action by God or may be mediatedby the actions of physicians or other medicalcaregivers. Blessings of the sick are generally given by two Melchizedek Priesthood bearers. There are notprescribed prayers for this kind of blessing, butone of the priesthood bearers anoints the head ofthe sick person with a little consecrated olive oiland says in substance: \"In the name of Jesus Christ and by authority of the Holy MelchizedekPriesthood, I lay my hands upon your head and anoint you with this consecrated oil, which hasbeen dedicated for the blessing of the sick.\" Additional words may be said in harmony with, and under the guidance of, the Spirit. Following this anointing, two or more priesthood bearers lay their hands upon the head of the sick person, and one being spokesman calls the personby name and says in substance, \"In the name ofJesus Christ and by the authority of the holy Melchizedek Priesthood, we seal and confirmupon you this anointing with which you have beenanointed to the end that . . .\" He then voices aprayer of supplication and of blessing as the Spiritdirects. The ordinance concludes in the name ofJesus Christ. If two priesthood bearers are not available for the ceremony, one may perform both parts of the blessing. 112 \"The resulting relief, healing, and fulfillment are not to be boasted about or heralded, butrather [are] to 'be spoken with care, and by con-straint of the Spirit' ([ Doctrine and Covenants ] 63:64; 84:73; 105:24)\" 113and are often faith and medicine.114 CCoommmmuunniittyy:: \"Sacraments relating to the care of the sick include Administration (anointing withoil, laying on of hands, and prayer of faith fordivine blessing); and the Lord's Supper (usingspecified prayers and bread and grape juice).\" 115 Administration is usually implemented by two or more elders, but in emergencies it may be per-formed by only one. 116 While hospitalized members of this church may \"seek to participate in the sacraments ofthe church, [the sacraments] are not requiredfor salvation and thus they are not seen to haveemergent efficacy. Of course, provisions shouldbe made for church sacraments as they may be requested. They are seen as an important meansof bringing comfort, strength, and healing topersons through faith and divine grace.\" 11720 THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSFasting LLDDSS:: \"Church members fast together generally on the first Sunday of each month, in prepara-tion for fast and testimony meeting. They usuallyabstain from food and drink for two consecutivemeals, attend Church services, and donate a fastoffering [equivalent to the cost of the two for-gone meals] for the care of the needy. Addition-ally, an individual, family, or congregation mayfast for a specific cause such as one who is sickor otherwise afflicted.\" 118 CCoommmmuunniittyy:: There is no requirement for any specific sacrament. Fasting the breakfast mealonce a month on Communion Sunday is sug-gested with an equivalent donation of money tothe church's oblation (world hunger) fund. Holy days LLDDSS:: Sunday is the Sabbath Day in the LDS church. Members are expected to rest from their daily labors as well as serve and worship theLord on that day. 119 CCoommmmuunniittyy::Sunday is the Sabbath Day in this church. POLITY, SCRI PTURE , AND DOCTRINE Polity LLDDSS::The First Presidency, comprised of the president of the church and two counselors, pre-sides over the LDS church. The Council of theTwelve Apostles acts under the direction of the First Presidency. Unanimous decisions by theFirst Presidency and the Quorum of TwelveApostles constitute the official policy of thechurch. The church has two orders of priesthood, both of which are nonprofessional. The lesser of thetwo is the Aaronic priesthood, which is comprisedof worthy young men aged twelve to eighteenwho receive priesthood offices within this order.The greater order is the Melchizedek priesthood. Generally, men aged nineteen and older receivethis priesthood, which permits them to serve in various capacities in the church. CCoommmmuunniittyy:: The spiritual head of this church is the prophet-president who, together with twocounselors, constitutes the First Presidency, thechief administrative quorum of the church. A council of Twelve Apostles makes up the chiefmissionary quorum of the church; the individualapostles also function as administrators in theirfields. There are three chief financial officers ofthe church, the presiding bishop and two coun-selors. These eighteen general officers make upthe Joint Council, an administrative and policy-making council. A World Conference made up of delegates from the thirty-eight countries where the churchis active meets biennially. This conference ap-proves annual budgets, sustains the general offi-cers, and approves, by common consent,legislation affecting the belief and practices ofthe church as a whole. \"Ministry needs are met in each congregation by a staff of lay ministers called priesthood mem-bers. The priesthood includes both men and women.\" 120The Priesthood Manual reminds its readers that \"most denominations have but oneordained minister in a congregation. Our priest-hood members should be very sensitive to thisfact when visiting in a hospital and not assumeministerial privileges or prerogatives when cir-cumstances do not justify it. Furthermore weshould be sensitive to the sheer numbers of ourpriesthood members who may visit a sick per-son.\" Healthcare providers should be aware thatpriesthood members generally \"follow the princi-ple of going two by two when visiting the sick.\" 121 Scripture and doctrine LLDDSS:: LDS scriptures include the Bible (King James Version), Book of Mormon , Pearl of Great Price, and Doctrine and Covenants. The Articles of Faith, written shortly before Joseph Smith'sdeath and currently used by most Latter-daySaints, affirm a belief in three separate divineentities, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The21 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERarticles deny original sin, affirm the value of Christ's atonement, and allow for individuals toexperience salvation through faith and obedi-ence. Saints recognize the primacy of two intro-ductory principles, faith and repentance, andtwo ordinances, baptism by immersion and thelaying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. CCoommmmuunniittyy:: Church scriptures include the Bible, Book of Mormon , and Doctrine and Covenants. There is no formal creed, but a Statement of Beliefs is published in Exploring the Faith. 122This statement affirms among other things a gen- erally trinitarian Godhead; it acknowledges thathuman sin is a rebellion against God which re-sults from free agency; and it affirms the efficacyof Christ's atonement for our salvation and hisrole as the instrument of reconciliation betweenGod and humanity. This church recognizes eight sacraments and ordinances: baptism, confirma-tion, communion of the Lord's Supper, ordina-tion, administering to the sick, marriage, blessingof babies, and blessing of youth and adults by 1.Melton 1993: 131-34. 2.Preston Hunter, \"Adherents.com September 13, 2001.

World Conference Bulletin. [Proceedings of the biennial World Conference of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.] April 1994.THELATTER -DAYSAINTSTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSReligious beliefs provide meaning for people confronting illness and seeking health, partic- ularly during times of crisis. Increasingly, health-care workers face the challenge of providingappropriate care and services to people of differentreligious backgrounds. Unfortunately, manyhealthcare workers are unfamiliar with the reli-gious beliefs and moral positions of traditions other than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of differ-ent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and adminis-trators in their decision making and caregiving. Itcan also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The authors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The authors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should not substitute for discussion of patients' own reli-gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds andbeliefs play a part in the way patients deal with pain, illness, and the decisions that arise in thecourse of treatment. Greater understanding ofreligious traditions on the part of care providers,we believe, will increase the quality of carereceived by the patient. The Park Ridge Center explores and en- hances the interaction of health, faith, and ethics through research, education, and consultation to improve the lives of individuals and communities.Introduction to the series THE PARK RIDGE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HEALTH, FAITH, AND ETHICS 211 E.
