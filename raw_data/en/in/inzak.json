The adjustments are an impulse into a joint that is restricting nerve function, enabling natural range and movement through that joint and removing pressure from the nerve. This precipitates and elicits a healing response in your body. There are [many different ways](https://evolvechiropracticgc.com.au/what-we-do-chiropractor/) we can adjust you, to suit your age, condition and state of health. The beauty of the adjustment lies in its accuracy and specificity, and we will take the time to analyse your spine correctly. More Info Neuro- Impulse Protocol (NIP) Neuro Impulse Protocol is a chiropractic technique and analysis protocol developed to assess you for nerve interference with a light adjustment style particularly suited for the very young or delicate.

More Info Frequently Asked Questions Children's FAQ One of the things we all love the most is getting that perfect adjustment! The secret to a great adjustment is your chiropractor knowing exactly where, when, and how to adjust, and this means a thorough initial assessment. This is also the time we rule out anything that we can't help you with, an important to take before commencing care. If you are in a lot of pain on your first visit, and concerned about waiting for your follow up, be sure to let your chiropractor know and they will do everything they can to help you. It all depends on your health goals, and pre- existing health of your body. You may need to come a little more often initially, just the same as if you were doing a fitness challenge, or getting your teeth straightened. Happily, we are very good at helping you find your ideal appointment time, organise your care schedule and can give you an efficient, smooth experience every time. Most people come to see us initially for spinal discomfort; this is definitely what chiropractors are best known for! Chiropractic is a drug free approach to your health problems, that also embraces natural movement and exercise, encourages healthy eating, as well as all other aspects of well-being. Chiropractors can potentially also assist with the neuro-musculoskeletal aspect of other health conditions, so if you aren't sure, the best way forward is to organise to speak to us. When viewed through a 'chiropractic filter', many of our health problems can be rectified through the restoration of good function and movement, and restoring healthy patterns that are necessary in order to thrive; such as sleep and nutrition. There are many causes of spinal problems, and things that can be related to the spine or musculoskeletal system, that can happen to us early in life, including, but not limited to birth trauma, the musculoskeletal aspect of tongue tie management, hip dysfunction, and of course the many falls that children have. Regardless of age, the focus of chiropractic is ensuring that the spine and nervous system of our practice members is as good as possible! Some common signs that a child may have a concern that they are unable to articulate are: - Difficulty with tummy time - The musculoskeletal aspect of tongue tie management - Constant crying in a car seat or when lying down - Lack of ease in moving parts of their body. There are also some other health conditions such as asthma in which chiropractic can specifically target the musculoskeletal aspect of your child's health: for more information about these conditions get in touch with us. We won't know if your child would benefit from chiropractic care without seeing them; we can assess your child and provide you with information and then refer you to the most appropriate type of health practitioner. No! The style of chiropractic we perform on children (like anyone) is adapted to suit their age and health. The adjusting is all light touch, with only a small amount of pressure and minimal movement. Pain when growing isn't normal, although it is very common. There are several possible causes, and chiropractic potentially can assist with the resolution. As with any other age group, this is an individual consideration from person to person and will depend on the state of health of your child's spine. Pregnancy FAQ Your health in pregnancy, viewed through a 'chiropractic' lens, is about the optimal health of the mother, including her ease of movement and joint health. From this point of view, we prefer to advocate for a proactive focus on these points rather than being reactive to a 'pain crisis'. Chiropractic has an exemplary safety record in pregnancy care. Your care however will be modified to accommodate your comfort and changing needs, respecting considerations such as ligament laxity, hormonal and blood pressure changes, and other aspects of your health. Many concerns that women experience during pregnancy can lead them into a chiropractor's office, which they may already have the foundations of, but be unaware of. This can include pelvic and uterine ligament tightness, pubic symphysis inflammation, and low back dysfunction. As improvements in these areas require an improvement in tension and health of the tissue, which requires time, we believe care is best begun at the beginning of pregnancy or when planning your pregnancy, rather than waiting for the symptoms to arise. The pregnancy-friendly Webster Technique is an analysis of the sacrum and pelvis, with a specific sacral correction involving a gentle sacral adjustment and a release of the uterine and pelvic ligaments. For this reason, it has deservedly achieved a reputation for assisting pregnant women. Dr Edwina has been certified in the Webster technique for ten years. "}
