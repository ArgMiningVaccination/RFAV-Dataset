The main campus is located in Boston's Longwood Medical and Academic Area, and the University enjoys working affiliations with some of the world's finest health institutions, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston Medical Center, Tufts Medical Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital. Among its neighbors are Emmanuel College ; Massachusetts College of Art and Design ; Simmons College ; Wentworth Institute of Technology ; Wheelock College ; and Harvard University's medical school, dental school, and school of public health. In this invigorating and stimulating environment, students have access to unsurpassed educational resources. Undergraduate degree programs offered at the Boston campus include biology, chemistry, dental hygiene, health psychology, premedical and health studies, p harmaceutical sciences, public health, medical imaging, and radiologic sciences. First professional degrees are offered in pharmacy, physician assistant studies, and nursing. Each of these programs combines the basic sciences with liberal arts and provides an education for lifelong enrichment. Graduate 11 October 26, 2016 programs are offered in chemistry, regulatory affairs, pharmaceutics, pharmacology, clinical research, pharmaceutical economics and policy, nursing, and dental hygiene. The Worcester Campus MCPHS has expand ed its degree programs on its Worcester campus, with its newest additions in acupuncture education (see The Newton Campus for further information). In fall 2016, the New England School of Acupuncture (NESA) at MCPHS University will have its inaugural class start their program on the Worcester campus in a newly renovated facility at 19 Norwich Street. This five -story building contains state of the art classrooms, practice labs, a store, an herbal dispensary, student lounge, study space, and a Teaching Center , where patients are offered a range of treatments. Students have the option of pursuing two graduate degrees: the Master's in Acupuncture (MAc) degree and a Master's in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (MAOM) degree. All students complete a core curricu lum based on study of medical theory, diagnostic and treatment skills of Traditional Chinese Medicine. At the end of the first year of study, students may elect to focus on Chinese Acupuncture Studies (CAS), or add concentrations in Japanese Acupuncture S tyles (JAS) and/or Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM). The Pain Management track provides an opportunity to earn dual Master's degrees from NESA at MCPHS and Tufts University School of Medicine. This innovative Tufts program in Pain Research Education and Pol icy (PREP) trains pain specialists to be well prepared to meet the challenges of managing patients' chronic pain. The Worcester campus is also home to an accelerated 33 -month PharmD program for students who have already completed their preprofessional req uirements; a Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene program for individuals with a prior baccalaureate degree in another field; a Fast Track Bachelor of Science degree program in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (General or Echo); a Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Nursing program for individuals with a prior baccalaureate degree in another field; a 24 -month Master of Physician Assistant Studies program; a Master of Science in Nursing (Family Nurse Practitioner and MSN with a Concentration in Teaching and Learning for Nurses), including an ADN to MSN Bridge program; a three -year Doctor of Physical Therapy degree program; and a four -year Doctor of Optometry (OD) program. Worcester is the second largest city in New England and is well known for its premier educational and healthcare institutions. The Worcester campus is located adjacent to Saint Vincent Hospital and in close proximity to the Fallon Clinic, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center, and the medical school of the Univers ity of Massachusetts. The Manchester Campus MCPHS -Manchester became an entity of the University in May 2002 when MCPHS assumed responsibility for the Physician Assistant (PA) Studies program and its faculty and staff from Notre Dame College upon its closi ng. The new campus building at 1260 Elm Street was purchased in November 2002, and the first class of PAstudents, faculty, and staff occupied the building in January 2003. In conjunction with the School of Pharmacy -Worcester, the accelerated Doctor of Pha rmacy degree program admitted its first class in Manchester in the fall of 2004. An accelerated 16 -month Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program for individuals with a prior baccalaureate in another field admitted its first cohort in September 2007. Manchester is New Hampshire's largest city and is the center of the state's diversified industrial and service economy, which developed in response to the decline of the mill dynasty in the 1930s. The University is situated parallel to the historic Amoskeag Mills, which house educational institutions, businesses, and small industry. The Newton Campus In March 2016, New England School of Acupuncture (NESA) became part of MCPHS University. NESA has been synonymous with excellence in acupuncture educa tion since 1974, making NESA the oldest acupuncture program in the US. By joining MCPHS, NESA connects Eastern medicine with Western health sciences to create the next generation of healthcare providers who embody integrative medicine. Students who matric ulated prior to the fall 2016 semester will complete their program at the Newton Campus. The facility in Newton has a Teaching Center and Chinese Herbal Medicine Center, servicing area acupuncture patients with low cost treatments. 12 October 26, 2016 Newton, one of the largest cities in Massachusetts, is approximately 7 miles west of Boston making it a desirable community to live and work. It is served by three modes of mass transit run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA); light rail, commuter rail and bus service. Center of Academic Innovation and Online Education, formerly MCPHS Online The Center of Academic Innovation and Online Education, formed in May 2016, serves as the University's incubator for new, cross -disciplinary programs and incorporates the development and oversight of online programs. MCPHS Online was formally created in January 2011 an d grew from 5 online programs to more than 30 . Most of the se programs are fully online and affiliate with the various schools. S ome of the online programs have residency components , which include orientation, clinical assessment, and/or capstone research experiences. In addition, the Center now owns several programs: BS in Biomedical Informatics, BS in Global Healthcare Management, Master of Healthcare Administration, and the Graduate Certificate in Healthcare Management. Several other programs are unde r development or revision. All of the programs offered by the Center of Academic Innovation and Online Education are designed to give students opportunities to reach greater potential as healthcare professionals through online and/or campus -based learning in convenient and accessible formats . For the online programs , students are educated by the same faculty, are immersed in the same professional environment, and earn the same sought -after degrees as if they were on our physical campus. 13 October 26, 2016 Degree and Certificate Programs School of Arts and Sciences (Boston) Bachelor of Science in Chemistry/Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Chemistry (shared with SOP -Boston) Bachelor of Science in Health Psychology ( 5 Pathway s) Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences (2 Pathways) Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences Degree Completion* Bachelor of Science in Medical and Molecular Biology (5 Pathways) Bachelor of Science in Premedical and Health Studies (17 Pathways) Bachelor of Science in Public Health (1 Pathway) BS in Public Health/ Master of Public Health* Master of Public Health* Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene (Boston/Worcester) Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene Bachelor of Science in Predental/Dental Hygiene Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics (Boston/Worcester) Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography -General Degree Completion (Worcester) Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography -General Post baccalaureate Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography -

(NEASC) , through its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education. Accreditation of an institution of higher education by NEASC indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a peer review pro cess. An accredited college or university is one that has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity also is addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by NEASC is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered or of the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding the accreditation status by NEASC should be directed to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs at 617.732.2854.

Waivers/Exemptions All MCPHS students who live in University sponsored housing or who subsequently move into University sponsored housing must provide documentation of having received a meningococcal vacci ne (within the last five years), unless they qualify for one of the exemptions allowed by the law. Students living in University sponsored housing may begin classes without a certificate of immunization against meningococcal disease if: 1) the student ha s a letter from a physician stating that there is a medical reason why he/she can't receive the vaccine; 2) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) presents a statement in writing that such vaccination is against his/ her sincere religious belief; or 3) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) signs a waiver stating that the student has received information about the dangers of meningococcal disease, reviewed the informati on provided and elected to decline the vaccine. If a student has a medical reason why he/she cannot receive a specific immunization, such immunization may be waived if the student submits a letter (on official letterhead with a signature) from the student's health care provider explaining the reason/s the student is unable to receive the required vaccination/s. 44 October 26, 2016 Immunizations may be waived for religious reasons if a student submits a statement in writing that such immunization is against a sincere r eligious belief. Additional Requirements Certain health care agencies and clinical training and service learning sites may have additional immuniza tion requirements. In order to be eligible for clinical placements or service learning experiences, studen ts must meet all University immunization requirements and any additional site requirements. In cases where the site does not pay for the completion of additional immunization requirements, the student is responsible for paying any associated fees, if it is not covered by their personal health insurance. Without clearance with respect to all University and site immunization requirements, students will not be permitted to begin clinical or service learning placements, and therefore, would be unable to meet p rogram requirements. Students who change academic programs must become compliant with all immunization requirements of their new academic program. Students must contact the Office of Student Affairs for necessary steps to review their immunization compli ance with the new academic program. MCPHS works with a confidential health information service company that maintains and processes all student immunization records and monitors compliance with state law immunization requirements. Authorized officials a t MCPHS have access to student immunization records to monitor compliance. Internships, Licensure, and Certification Students graduating from the Dental Hygiene, Nursing, Optometry, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, and Physician Assistant programs at MCPHS University will seek professional licensure in conjunction with a national examination in order to practice in their chos en profession. Regulations governing licensure (and internship) differ from state to state and country to country. The Registrar's Office completes application materials for licensure candidates and assists students in navigating the overall licensing proc ess. Licensure application preparation sessions are offered for students prior to graduation. Licensure application materials for all programs will not be released by the Registrar's Office until the degree and date awarded have been posted to student records. Only materials with a submission deadline required for specific state board testing will be released prior to degree posting. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program will take part in practical experience overseen by a registered pharmacist . National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidelines require that pharmacy students complete 1 ,500 clock hours of practical pharmacy experience prior to applying for licensure. Students completing their practical experience must register as a phar macy intern (as applicable) with the state in which they complete their internship experience. Internship hours must be documented as specified on the internship application form or state board of pharmacy website. As with licensure, intern eligibility cri teria and paperwork differ from state to state. Mandatory intern preparation sessions are scheduled for students before they can apply for internship. Further information regarding the licensure and internship process can be found on the Registrar's Office page of the University website, including application materials for Massachusetts (all professions) and New Hampshire (Physician Assistant, Nursing). 45 October 26, 2016 Protection from Harassment Policy (TITLE IX) POLICY STATEMENT MCPHS University (\"MCPHS\" or the \"University\") is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment.

Provisional students are those who have not met the minimum undergraduate grade point averages and/or GRE scores for admission. Provisional status also may be applied to students whose credentials do not meet specific program requireme nts. Provisional students must adhere to regulations established by the Graduate Council and be working toward a degree on a full -time basis. In order to achieve regular status, the student must complete the equivalent of two academic semesters (at least 9 semester hours) of full -time work with an overall grade point average of 3.0. If the student had not taken the GRE at the time of admission as a provisional student, the student must take the GRE during the first semester of provisional status. At any ti me during the first year of matriculation following completion of the above criteria, a student may initiate an Approval for Change of Student Status in the Office of Graduate Studies. However, the student's graduate advisor also may initiate the change an d should do so when the student has met the required criteria, or may request the change of status before the student has completed 9 semester credits.

Residence hall dues (Boston and Worcester campuses) $126 Health Insurance Per year $2,288 According to the Commo nwealth of Massachusetts and MCPHS policy, all matriculated students (regardless of enrollment) must be covered by a health insurance program. The University makes available a general health insurance program that meets the required standards. This policy is provided by an independent carrier, beginning September 1 and continuing 12 months. Insurance brochures will be available online. Students will be automatically enrolled in this plan unless a waiver is completed and received by Student Financial Service s prior to the first day of classes. Students registering late must submit the waiver at that time. The waiver stipulates that personal coverage will be maintained during the enrollment period. If Student Financial Services does not receive the waiver prio r to the first day of classes, the student will be billed for the insurance premium and will remain responsible for payment of said premium. The waiver must be renewed annually. All international students will be enrolled in the Blue Cross Blue Shield stu dent health insurance plan automatically, with the exception of those international students whose sponsoring institutions have a signed agreement with MCPHS that complies with the University's health insurance waiver requirements, or those international s tudents with a plan for which the health insurance company's primary home office is based in the United States and the policy provides coverage comparable to that of the University student health insurance plan. International students who do not fall under one of the two conditions above must purchase the University's student health insurance plan. Criminal Backgroun d Information Fees Any out -of-pocket expenses for criminal or sex offender background checks that may be required by clinical rotation sites, including, without limitation, Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI), Sex Offender Registry Information (SOR I) checks, or level 1 background checks, must be paid by the student. Credit Cards The University accepts MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express through its online payment provider. 76 October 26, 2016 Payment Schedule Tuition and applicable fees are due and payable on a semester basis, prior to the following deadlines: Fall semester: August 1 Spring semester: December 1 Summer semester: May 1 Students not adhering to these deadlines may be administratively withdrawn from the University. For students w ith outstanding balances, the University reserves the right to refuse to release official transcripts, to release the diploma certifying graduation, to complete board examination certification, or to register the student for any additional coursewo rk. A late payment fee will be assessed for all outstanding balances immediately following the due date. Late Fees Late payment fee $500 Returned check fee $30 If a student has more than two checks returned by the bank, he/she will be required to make all future payments by money order, certified bank check, Discover, MasterCard, Visa, or American Express. Other Estimated Expenses In addition to the direct costs of tuition, fees, and room and board, students also should budget for indirect expenses, such as books and supplies, transportation expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses that will vary depending on personal spending habits and choices. Address Changes Address change forms are located at the Office of the Registrar. Current students may c hange their address online using WebAdvisor. Add/Drop Period Add/drop period deadline for all programs is specified for each academic term, usually within the first week of classes. During add/drop period, tuition is fully refundable for a course withdra wal. Student accounts are adjusted automatically, and any additional charges must be paid at the time of the transaction. After the add/drop deadline, there will be no tuition refund for individual course withdrawal. University Withdrawal, Leave of Absen ce and Refund The following graduated scale of charges for tuition and residence hall fees is used for purposes of determining refunds for students completely withdrawing from the University during the semester, as well as students taking a Leave of Absenc e: PERIOD OF ATTENDANCE REFUND Add/drop period 100% First week after the add/drop period 50% Second week after the add/drop period 25% Third week and beyond after the add/drop period 0% Students who withdraw from the University must contact the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) at the time of withdrawal and complete an official form. Students taking a Leave of Absence from the University must contact their Academic Dean to complete the official process. Approved refunds are computed on the basis of the date appearing on the form. Absence from class without completing the form does not constitute withdrawal or approved Leave of Absence from the University. Students should c ontact Student Financial Services to determine how this withdrawal affects their financial aid. 77 October 26, 2016 Student Financial Services Applying for Financial Aid The Office of Student Financial Services at MCPHS is dedicated to providing comprehensive education financing counseling to students and their families. The staff is available to assist students by answering questions regarding the aid application process, their financial aid award, and their student account. The University offers a variety of scholarsh ips, loans, and employment opportunities to assist students in meeting the costs of education that cannot be met through the family's own resources. To apply for financial aid for the 20 16-17 academic year, the only application required is the 2016 -2017 Fr ee Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA may be completed online at www.fafsa.gov. Students who submitted a 2015 -2016 FAFSA should use their PIN (personal identification number) from the Department of Education to complete the online renew al application. The Office of Student Financial Services will notify students if additional information or documentation is required to complete their financial aid applications. Students should not send additional documentation unless requested to do so by Student Financial Services. Notification of awards: Award letters will be emailed to freshmen and new transfer students on a rolling basis once the student's financial aid file is complete. Continuing students selected for verification will be notified of their award once all documentation has been received and the verification process is complete. A student must reapply for aid each year; however, aid packages may vary from one year to the next. The student's demonstrated need is recalculated e ach year, and award amounts are contingent upon the University's level of allocated funds. Eligibility for Financial Aid In order to be considered for financial aid, a student must be enrolled or accepted for admission as at least a half -time student at t he University and must be eligible for federal financial aid. To be eligible for federal student aid, the student must be a citizen, permanent resident, or eligible nonresident of the United States; registered with the Selective Service System or exempt from registration; not in default on any federal student loan or owing a refund on any federal grant; not convicted of any federal or state drug offense while receiving federal student aid; and in good academic standing. By completing the application instructions previously outlined, students are automatically considered for all possible funding opportunities, including those offered by the federal government, the state (if eligible), and the University. Please keep in mind that students wh o meet the March 15 financial aid application deadline are given priority consideration for all available funds, which are limited by allocations and budgets. Degree Standing A student's standing as an undergraduate or graduate student is an important fac tor in the financial aid application and award process. The FAFSA asks students to identify whether they are in an undergraduate or graduate/professional program. These questions should be answered based on the following criteria: Undergraduate Students Students in the following programs are considered undergraduate students for financial aid purposes: Chemistry Dental Hygiene Diagnostic Medical Sonography Health Psychology Health Sciences Magnetic Resonance Imaging Medical and Molecular Biol ogy Nuclear Medicine Technology Nursing Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Business Pharmaceutical Sciences 78 October 26, 2016 Pharmacology/Toxicology PharmD -Boston campus: Years I -IV Premedical and Health Studies Public Health Radiation Therapy Radiography Bachelor of Pre -Dental -Dental Hygiene Graduate Students Students in the following programs are considered graduate/professional students for financial aid purposes: Master of Physician Assistant Studies (Boston and Manchester/Worcester) Master of Publ ic Health Master of Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy PharmD -Boston campus : Years V and VI PharmD -Worcester/Manchester campuses: all years (unless advised by Student Financial Services) Doctor of Optometry Doctor of Physical Therapy Master of Science in Dental Hygiene Master of Science in Nursing Master of Science / PhD in Medicinal Chemistry Master of Science / PhD in Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy Master of Science / PhD in Pharmaceutics Master of Science / PhD in Pharmacolo gy Master of Science in Clinical Research Master of Science in Occupational Therapy Master of Acupuncture Master of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Students whose program is not listed here should contact the Office of the Registrar for assistance in identifying their degree standing. Student Status Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) -Boston: Years I through IV are classified undergraduate, and full -time status is a minimum of 12 semester hours; at the point a PharmD student attains fifth -year status, full -time status is a minimum of 9 semester hours. Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) -Worcester/Manchester: Year I is classified undergraduate, and full -time status is a minimum of 12 semester hours; for Years II and III, full -time status is 9 semester h ours. For all baccalaureate degree programs, students are classified as undergraduates, and full -time status is a minimum of 12 semester hours. For all masters, MS, other doctoral, and PhD programs , full-time status is a minimum of 9 semester hours. Dependency Status For the 2016 -2017 school year (July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017), the U.S. Department of Education considers the following students to be independent of their parent(s) for purposes of awarding federal financial aid: Students who were b orn before January 1, 1993 Students who are orphans or wards of the court, or were wards of the court at any point during or after age 13 Students who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces Students who have children, if they provide more than half of the support for the child Students who have dependents (other than a child or spouse) living with them, if they provide more than half of the support for the dependent Students who are married Students who will be graduate/professional students in 2 016-2017 (see Degree Standing to determine who is considered a graduate/professional student for financial aid purposes) Students who are serving on active duty in the armed forces for purposes other than training Students who are or were emancipated m inors as determined by a court Students who are or were in a legal guardianship as determined by a court 79 October 26, 2016 Students who are or were considered an unaccompanied youth who was homeless on or after July 1, 2016 As the criteria above indicate, financial independence is not one of the criteria used in determining whether a student is considered dependent or independent. Parental data must be provided on the FAFSA for students who are unable to answer \"yes\" to one of the listed criteria. The University uses the U.S. Department of Education definition of dependency status for all federal, state, institutional, and private financial aid programs. Students should refer to the FAFSA for specific details on each of the above criteria or contact the Office of Stud ent Financial Services for assistance in determining status. Prior Bachelor's Degree Students who are in possession of a baccalaureate degree prior to their enrollment at the University are not eligible for certain grant programs, including the Federal Pe ll Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and state scholarship/grant programs. Massachusetts Residency Massachusetts residency is defined as having resided in Massachusetts for purposes other than attending college for at least one y ear prior to the beginning of the academic year. (The beginning of the academic year is defined as July 1 by the Commonwealth.) Parents of dependent students also must have resided in Massachusetts for at least one year prior to the beginning of the academ ic year. Programs funded by the Commonwealth are limited to undergraduate students without a prior bachelor's degree. Yellow Ribbon Program The Yellow Ribbon Program is available to any Veteran who has served a total of 36 months active duty on or after September 10, 2001 and has the maximum Post -9/11 GI Bill benefits. Students who are eligible for 100% Post -9/11 GI Bill benefits can apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program once they receive their academic acceptance from the University. In order to receive a full acceptance of a Yellow Ribbon Scholarship, students must submit their Certificate of Eligibility for the Post -9/11 GI Bill from the VA to the University. Due to the limited number of scholarships, all Yellow Ribbon Scholarships are first come first s erve and only students who have completed all Yellow Ribbon Application requirements can receive a scholarship. Enrollment Status Financial aid awards are based on full -time attendance at the University. Full -time attendance, during the fall semester and the spring semester, is defined as a minimum of 12 credits for undergraduate students and 9 credits for graduate students (see Degree Standing to determine graduate/professional student status for financial aid purposes). Full time attendance, during the s ummer semester, is defined as a minimum of 9 credits for undergraduate accelerated programs. Enrollment is reviewed for all students receiving financial aid at the end of the official add/drop period each semester, at which time adjustments to financial ai d awards are made. The following aid programs require full -time enrollment. Less than full -time enrollment will result in complete loss of the award : Gilbert Grant Health Professions Loan MASSGrant Most state grants The following programs are prorated based on enrollment status. For these programs, undergraduate students will receive 75% of their award if they are enrolled in 9 -11 credits and 50% of their award if they are enrolled in 6 -8 credits. Students will not be eligible if they are enrolled in less than six credits except for Federal Pell Grant. Federal Pell Grant (students enrolled in 1 -5 credits receive a prorated portion of the Pell Grant) Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant MCPHS Schol arship Graduate students must be enrolled in at least 5 credits to be considered eligible for their award. The following programs require at least half -time enrollment. Less than half -time enrollment will result in complete loss of the award. Half -time e nrollment is defined as 6 credits for undergraduate students and 5 credits for graduate students Federal Perkins Loan Federal PLUS loan Federal Stafford Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) Federal Work -Study Program 80 October 26, 2016 Most alternative loans Gradua te Students Graduate students who want to apply for assistantships, scholarships, and fellowships should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. Graduate Assistantships. The University has a limited number of graduate assistantships that are comp etitively awarded to qualified full -time students in the Division of Graduate Studies, including international students. Full -time graduate assistants may be eligible to receive remission of tuition up to the maximum of 12 semester hour credits per academi c year. No final commitment for assistantships can be made until an applicant has been accepted and the matriculation fee remitted. Assistantships are awarded on a highly selective basis, with preference given to students who have been enrolled at the Univ ersity for one full year of graduate study. Scholarships and Fellowships. Among the scholarships and fellowships available for graduate study ar e the following: American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education Fellowship United States Pharmacopeia Fe llowship International Applicants Financial aid in the form of grants and loans is not available to international students. There are several private lenders who offer loans to international students. Students may qualify for a Private Educational Loan with a credit worthy U.S. Citizen Co -signer. Satisfactory Academic Progress The University is required to establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) for students receiving financial aid. The University applies these standards to a ll federal, state, and institutional funds. The Office of Student Financial Services will disburse financial aid only to those students who are in good academic standing and are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree. Requirements A student is not making satisfactory academic progress if any of the following conditions exist: The student's cumulative grade point average (GPA) is below 2.0 at the end of the second year of his/her academic program. Grade point averages are reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee at the end of each semester. The student's earned credits (completed with a passing grade) are less than 67% of all attempted credits (coursework), as calculated at the end of each semester. The student has exceeded the maximum time frame of attempted credits (150%) of the published length of his/her degree program. Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each semester (payment period). The following describes how types of coursework are used in the SA P calculation: Dropped coursework is not included. Failing grades (F) are included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Incomplete grades (I) are included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Withdrawals are included in earned and attempted credits. Repeated coursework is included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Pass/fail coursework is included in earned and attempted credits. Audit coursework is not included. Colleges of the Fenway (COF) coursework is included in th e GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Transfer coursework (applicable to current program) is included in earned and attempted credits. Satisfactory/unsatisfactory coursework (graduate programs only) is included in earned and attempted credits. Remedia l coursework is not included. If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be placed on financial aid warning. A student then has one semester to make satisfactory progress. If, after one semester on financial aid warning, a student is not making satisfactory academic progress, the student becomes ineligible for aid. Students who are ineligible for financial aid because they are not making satisfactory academic progress may appeal to regain eligibility for the subsequent sem ester to achieve the SAP standards. Students may also continue to take 81 October 26, 2016 coursework without the use of financial assistance until eligibility is reinstated by achieving the required SAP standards. Appeals are considered when a student can demonstrate that an extraordinary circumstance existed (for example, student illness, the illness or death of a family member) that prevented him/her from achieving satisfactory academic progress. Students considering an SAP appeal should contact the Office of Student Fina ncial Services to make an appointment to discuss the situation. Appeals are due within two weeks of receipt of notification of academic status; however, an appeal does not exclude the student's payment responsibility associated with the semester's bill due date. Incomplete appeals will not be reviewed. Students with an approved appeal will be placed on financial aid probation and have one semester to achieve satisfactory academic progress. If the student fails to achieve the SAP standards after probation, t hen he/she will not be eligible for aid until the standards are achieved. If MCPHS determines, based on the appeal, the student will require more than one academic semester to meet progress standards, the University may grant a subsequent appeal; if an aca demic plan is developed for the student, the student must successfully complete the program in the specified time. Students will be reviewed at the end of one academic semester to determine if they are meeting the requirements of the plan. If the student is meeting the requirement of the academic plan, the student is eligible to receive Title IV funds as long as the student continues to meet those requirements, and is reviewed according to the requirements detailed in the plan. Nonmatriculating students ar e not eligible for financial aid. Process for Awarding Financial Aid In selecting financial aid recipients, primary emphasis is placed upon financial need, availability of funds, the student's academic achievement, and/or satisfactory academic progress. Determining Need To determine a student's need, the University uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information provided on the FAFSA is used to determine what amount a family can be expected to contribute toward the cost of attending the Universi ty (the expected family contribution, or EFC). The University uses the standard federal formula (known as the federal methodology, or FM) in computing the expected parental and student contributions. Some of the factors used in the analysis include incom e, assets, family size, and number of family members in college. The student's expected contribution is added to the parental expected contribution to produce the total expected family contribution. The student's financial need is determined by subtracting the expected family contribution from the total cost of attending the University. The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees as well as an allowance for room and board, books and supplies, travel, federal loan fees, and other education -related expen ses. The Financial Aid Package After the student's financial need is determined, Student Financial Services will develop a financial aid package for the student. MCPHS utilizes scholarships, loans, and employment opportunities to assist students in meeti ng as much of their demonstrated financial need as possible. The University makes every effort to distribute the available funds in an equitable fashion in order to assist the greatest number of eligible students. The total amount of aid a student receives may not exceed his or her total cost of attendance. The University offers a variety of scholarships, which are funded through endowments, gifts, and other monies raised by the University. Scholarships are awarded primarily based on financial need and aca demic achievement. Students applying for financial aid are automatically considered for each scholarship for which they may qualify. Major programs providing financial aid to students are described in the 2016 -2017 MCPHS Student Financial Services handbook. Private Funding Sources In addition to the federal, state, and University programs offered through the University's financial aid application process , students also are encouraged to apply for outside aid to help meet the costs of education. Sev eral free scholarship search services are available through the Internet (please visit the University's website at www.mcphs.edu for further information). In addition, most high school and public libraries have resources detailing private scholarship oppor tunities. Verification Process Each year the federal government and/or MCPHS selects students who have completed the FAFSA for verification. The verification process simply requires the University to review supporting documents to verify the information r eported on the FAFSA for the parent(s), student, and spouse. Information that must be verified may include adjusted gross income; federal tax paid; untaxed income; education credits; child support paid; SNAP (food stamp) benefits; the number of family me mbers in the household; the number of children 82 October 26, 2016 in the household who are enrolled at least half time in college; high school completion status; identity / statement of educational purpose; living allowances paid to members of the military, clergy, and other s; and veterans' noneducation benefits. If you are selected for verification, you will be notified of additional documents that you must submit to complete your financial aid file. An MCPHS verification worksheet may be required along with any appropriate tax/income documentation. The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows students and parents to access the IRS tax return information needed to complete the FAFSA. Students and parents may transfer the data directly into their FAFSA. MCPHS encourages all students and families to utilize the IRS data retrieval process, which is the preferred method for FAFSA filers to report federal tax information. If the IRS data retrieval process is not used on an FAFSA transaction, then the student and/or parent will need to obt ain a federal tax return transcript from the IRS. A federal tax return transcript is required when the applicant (or parent) does not use the IRS data retrieval process \u2014 either at initial FAFSA filing or though the FAFSA on -the-Web correction process. Stu dents and/or parents may complete online requests for a federal tax return transcript at www.irs.gov . Online requests are considered the quickest approach to obtain a federal tax return transcript. The request may take up to 10 days to fulfill. There are also certain conditions that will require a federal tax return transcript for processing: When information included on the FAFSA using the IRS data retrieval process was subsequently changed When a married independent applicant and spouse filed separate tax returns When the parents of a dependent student filed separate tax returns When an applicant or applicant's parent had a change in marital status after the end of the tax year on December 31, 2016 When the ap plicant, or parent or spouse, as applicable, filed an amended tax return When requested by the University Incoming students will receive estimated award packages but are required to submit verification requirements upon request. Continuing students are required to submit all verification requirements prior to receiving an award package. MCPHS will not disburse federal, state, and institutional financial aid to a student's account until the student completes the verification process. Failure to complet e the verification process will result in cancellation of federal financial aid. The University reserves the right to verify any file that appears to contain discrepant information. In addition to verifying a student's application data, MCPHS is required b y federal law to resolve any conflicts of information that become evident as part of the application review process. All discrepancies must be resolved prior to disbursement of Title IV aid to a student's account. Additional Student Financial Services Appeal Process Students and parents may appeal their financial aid award if there is a significant and unforeseen change in circumstances or if there is information that was not provided on the original application materials. For additional details regardi ng the financial aid appeal process, refer to the 2016 -2017 MCPHS Student Financial Services handbook . All appeals must be in writing and must include documentation of the reasons for requesting the reevaluation of the financial aid package as well as comp lete tax transcripts and W -2s (if necessary) for the student and parent (if the student is a dependent). Applying Financial Aid to Your Student Account If all necessary paperwork has been submitted by the student and parents, financial aid will be applied to a student's account after add/drop each semester. Failure to submit the necessary paperwork will result in the delay and possible cancellation of the student's financial aid. Refunds Students will automatically receive a refund for any excess funds (credit balance) on their student account each semester. Refunds are available as soon as administratively possible after the completion of the add/drop period each semester following verifi cation of student enrollment and disbursement of financial aid funds. Pending financial aid may 83 October 26, 2016 require action on the part of the student prior to disbursement, which if delayed, may delay your refund. Students should be sure to make arrangements each seme ster for the purchase of books and payment of rent (if housed off campus), since refunds are not available during the first few weeks of each academic term. It is highly recommended for ease in refund processing that students sig n up for direct deposit tho ugh w ebadvisor. Late Payment Fees Students with outstanding student account balances will be charged a late payment fee. To avoid late payment fees, students must ensure that all financial obligations (including tuition, fees, health insurance fees, and housing charges) will be met by the dates specified in the Tuition section of this catalog. Students receiving financial aid and/or private alternative loans must ensure that proper documentation is completed and aid and/or loan funds are received by the University on or before the payment due date in order to avoid a late fee. Students participating in a payment plan must ensure that the payment plan budget for each term will cover all outstanding charges. Payment plan budgets that will not result in a pa id-in-full status by the end of the payment term will be assessed a late payment fee. For students with outstanding balances, the University reserves the right to refuse to release official transcripts, to release the diploma certifying graduation, to complete board exam ination certification, or to register the student for any other coursework to access campus wide systems such as blackboard, webadvisor and University E -mail to view final grades Students wishing to appeal late payment fees are required to do the following: 1. Pay the student account balance due in full (less the late payment fee). 2. Submit the following in writing to the Office of Student Financial Services: Student name Student ID number The reason(s) or documentation that contributed to the circumstances of the late payment fee The student will be notified of the decision concerning the appeal of a late payment fee. Student Account Statements Student account statements are sent electronically on a month ly basis. Statements include all recent account activity, including charges, payments, disbursements of financial aid and loan funds, and account adjustments. Balances due must be paid by the payment due date to avoid late payment fees. Students have the a bility to view real -time charges and updates through the Student Account Center as well as grant shared access to their account. The University accepts electronic funds transfer, MasterCard, Discover, Visa, and American Express. Work -Study Students work ing in a Federal Work -Study Program position are paid through a weekly paycheck based on hours actually worked. These funds are not credited to the student's account. Withdrawal and Approved Leave of Absence from the University Students withdrawing or taking a leave of absence from the University who have been determined to be eligible for federal financial aid are subject to certain provisions surrounding the calculation of their federal aid eligibility. A feder ally determined formula is used to calcul ate the amount of federal aid a student is eligible to receive based on the portion of the semester completed before the withdrawal. If a student received more assistance than was earned, the unearned funds must be returned to the Department of Education. The amount of aid a student is eligible to receive is based on the percentage of the semester that was completed prior to the initiation of the withdrawal process. For example, if 40% of the semester has passed when the withdrawal process is initiated, th en 40% of the federal aid originally scheduled for disbursement has been earned. Once 60% of the semester has been completed, a student is considered to have earned 100% of the federal aid he or she was eligible to receive. If it is determined that a stud ent received more federal aid than was earned, MCPHS will return the unearned funds based on a formula comparing institutional charges with the unearned percentage of funds. If MCPHS must return a 84 October 26, 2016 portion of the funds, the removal of those funds from the s tudent's account will create a balance due, which the student will be required to pay. If MCPHS is not required to return the unearned portion of funds, then the student must return the remaining amount. If the unearned funds needing to be returned are lo ans, the student may repay the amount in accordance with the original terms of the promissory note. If the student is responsible for returning any federal grant funding, he or she is required to return all but 50% of the amount that was calculated to be r efunded. The remaining 50% is considered a grant overpayment and must be paid directly to the U.S. Department of Education. To find out how a withdrawal during the first 60% of the semester may affect a financial aid award, students should make an appointment to discuss the situation with their Student Financial Services representative. 85 October 26, 2016 Academic Po licies and Procedures Introduction General University policies and procedures are stated below. Students should note that within individual programs and schools there might be additional requirements or variations of these policies. The ultimate responsibility for complying with academic policies and fulfilling graduation requirements rests with the individual student. Academic Honesty The University presumes that students will assume personal responsibility and maintain personal integrity in all aspects of their education. Dishonest actions in the execution of an examination, report, academic assignment, and/or academic coursework requi rement, including clinical rotations, constitute violations of the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy. Such violations are subject to specific academic sanctions, as well as to disciplinary sanctions (i.e., disciplinary warning, probation, deferred suspension, suspension, and/or expulsion). Academic Honest y and Student Discipline Procedures Academic violations or offenses include the following: 1.01 Receiving assistance, or attempting to receive assistance, not authorized by an instructor in the preparation of any assignment, laboratory exercise, report, or examination submitted as a requirement for an academic course or rotation. 1.02 Knowingly givi ng unauthorized assistance, or attempting to give unauthorized assistance, to another student in the preparation of any assignment, laboratory exercise, report, or examination submitted as a requirement for an academic course or rotation. 1.03 Plagiarism: Submitting another person's work (including words, images, and ideas) as one's own without the proper acknowledgment of source, or use of the words or ideas of another without crediting the source of those words or ideas. Also, submitting the same work f or assignments in more than one class (copying from oneself) without permission from the instructor and/or appropriate citation, in the same semester or subsequent semesters. 1.04 Obtaining or attempting to engage another person to take one's own examinati on. 1.05 Selling, giving, lending, or otherwise furnishing any material that can be shown to contain the questions or answers to any examination scheduled to be given at any subsequent date in any course of study offered by the University. 1.06 Taking, o r attempting to take, steal, or otherwise procure in any unauthorized manner any material pertaining to the conduct of a class, including examinations. 1.07 Falsifying or presenting fictional patient information as real to fulfill requirements for work as signed by individual faculty members or clinical preceptors. 1.08 Signing in another student or requesting to be signed in by another student on a course attendance sheet; or falsely recording another student's attendance (as with the use of \"clicker\"). 1.09 Altering, or attempting to alter grades or information on any assignment, laboratory exercise, report, exam, or previously completed examination as a requirement for an academic course or rotation. Implementation of the Academic Honesty Policy 1. The Dean of Students or designee will review the Academic Honesty Policy, issues of dishonesty, and consequences of violating the Academic Honesty Policy during new student orientation. 2. The Academic Honesty Policy will be provided by the Office of Stu dent Affairs to all members of the MCPHS community online through the MCPHS student handbook. All entering MCPHS students are expected to acknowledge they have read the Academic Honesty Policy via an online process coordinated by the Office of Student Affa irs. Refusal to do so may result in more severe sanctions should a student be found responsible for an academic honesty violation. 3. In specific testing and/or evaluation situations, students may be required to present their MCPHS ID cards to verify identity. 4. Each instructor is responsible for informing students of the standards of behavior expected of students in the classroom, la boratory, and clinical site and for consistently enforcing such standards. 5. Faculty may require that students sign an academic honesty statement for exam and written graded assignments. The statement will read as follows: Academic Honesty Statement I pledge that I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid, and will not give or receive unauthorized aid on any examination, paper and/or assignment. 86 October 26, 2016 Student Name (printed)_____________________________________________________________ Student Signat ure:______________________________ID Number:__________________________ Plagiarism Prevention Service Students are expected to abide by the University's Academic Honesty Policy as outlined. Plagiarism (see Offense 1.03 above) is considered a violation of this policy. In order to deter plagiarism and ensure appropri ate use of resources in student research and learning, the University subscribes to a plagiarism prevention service. Faculty may require students to submit their written work electronically thr ough this plagiarism prevention service in order to verify that when ideas of others are used they are cited appropriately. The course syllabus identifies student work that must be submitted electronically for such review. Academic Honesty and Exams The school deans are responsible for the proper conduct of examinations in their schools and will assign faculty and graduate assistants to serve as proctors for examinations. Support staff, under the supervision of the school deans, are responsible for maint aining confidentiality in the production and reproduction of examinations. Instructors are expected to assist in the promotion of academic honesty through the following practices: Access to and use of \"recycled\" exams should be limited. Students w ill be required to leave all unnecessary materials (i.e., all backpacks, notebooks, texts, calculators, PDAs, cellular phones, etc.) away from their seat assignment \u2014only required materials will be allowed at the seat assignment. All exams are to be pro ctored. In specific evaluation situations, students may be asked to show instructors/proctors materials being used during the exam (PDAs, cellular phones, etc.) to ensure proper use of the allowed material and adherence to the honesty policy. Instruc tors are encouraged to utilize the following exam seating practices whenever possible: Students entering an exam room will be randomly seated. Seating assignments will be spaced throughout the exam room, allowing for adequate spaces between student s. The instructor should follow the University Policy on Academic Honesty when giving examinations and ensure that proctors are present at all examinations in compliance with this policy. At least one (1) course coordinator for each course should be pres ent during an examination to answer questions or to clarify issues that may arise. Exceptions to this rule must be approved by the school dean. Students are expected to report violations of the Academic Honesty Policy to the instructor and/or the departm ent/division chair or program director of the academic department for further investigation. Student Discipline Procedures for Academic Honesty Policy Violations Preliminary procedure: The University maintains a policy of open communication among all me mbers of the University community so that any misunderstanding can be minimized and any conflicts can be expeditiously resolved between the parties involved. Hence, the first step in attempting to resolve an alleged student violation shall ordinarily be a meeting between the faculty member and the accused student(s). The faculty member will schedule a meeting with the student to attempt to come to a resolution. The meeting should be scheduled within seven business days of the faculty member's knowledge of the alleged academic dishonesty incident(s). The faculty member will give the student a copy of the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy and Student Discipline Procedures and of fer the Office of Student Affairs as a resource to discuss student rights and respon sibilities. The faculty member will provide the accused student with the information the faculty member has regarding the alleged incident and will provide the accused student(s) the opportunity to respond to the presented information. After listening to the student response, the faculty member can do one of the following: Determine academic dishonesty did not occur and not pursue the incident further OR 87 October 26, 2016 Determine academic dishonesty did occur and discuss the academic sanction the faculty member wi ll assign (i.e., repeat of the assignment, grade reduction, failure for the assignment or exam, failure for the course). If consequences regarding academic dishonesty are listed in the course syllabus, faculty sanctions must follow information as indicated in the syllabus. The faculty member will provide the student with the option to meet with a staff member in the Office of Student Affairs to review the student's rights and responsibilities prior to the faculty member's finalizing his/her decision. If the student accepts the faculty -assigned consequence, the case is closed provided the student has no prior offenses of the academic honesty policy or the violation is so severe that a hearing is deemed necessary by the Office of Student Affairs . NOTE: There is no option for appeal in a closed case. Parties (faculty and student) unable to agree shall appeal the case to the academic school dean (or designee). The academic school dean (or designee) can decide to meet individually with the student and faculty member or to conduct a three -way meeting with the student and faculty member, to be scheduled within seven class days of the initial faculty/student meeting. The academic dean (or designee) will meet with the involved parties and review the case. Subsequen t to case review, the academic dean (or designee) can do one of the following: Determine academic dishonesty did not occur and not pursue the incident further OR Determine academic dishonesty did occur and discuss the academic sanction he/she will as sign (i.e., repeat of the assignment, grade reduction, failure for the assignment or exam, failure for the course). If consequences regarding academic dishonesty are listed in the course syllabus, academic sanctions must follow information as indicated in the syllabus. Appellate decisions are final. Students should be advised that, regardless of the academic resolution, all academic dishonesty violations will be reported to and recorded with the Office of Student Affairs . Subsequent to a student's accepting responsibility in discussion with the course faculty member or academic dean (or designee), the Dean of Students or designee will send a letter to the student, faculty member, and academic dean outlining the decisions reached among the involved p arties (e.g., loss of points, change of grade, failure of exam, etc.), along with notification of a student conduct sanction, the minimum being disciplinary warning. Should the Dean of Students, or designee, determine that further action is required, based upon the disciplinary history of the student or severity of the violation, then the matter will be processed as outlined in the student discipline system in a hearing, as appropriate. All cases involving academic dishonesty will be recorded with the Office of Student Affairs , regardless of the resolution process utilized. Faculty and academic deans report, consult, and work collaboratively with the Office of Student Affairs regarding each alleged academic dishonesty incident. Complex alleged academic dis honesty incidents that require extensive fact finding or involve a conflict of interest (i.e., the academic dean is the instructor for the course in which academic dishonesty is alleged) may be referred by the faculty member or academic dean immediately to the Office of Student Affairs for review and disciplinary procedures as outlined in the student discipline system. All cases involving academic dishonesty will be recorded with the Dean of Students' office, regardless of the resolution process utilized. Faculty and academic deans report, consult, and work collaboratively with the Dean of Students' office regarding each alleged academic dishonesty incident. Complex alleged academic dishonesty incidents that require extensive fact finding or involve a confl ict of interest (i.e., the academic dean is the instructor for the course in which academic dishonesty is alleged) may be referred by the faculty member or academic dean immediately to the Dean of Students' office for review and disciplinary procedures as outlined in the student discipline system. NOTE: A student may continue attending class during the resolution process for an academic dishonesty incident. When a final decision is made that a student has failed a course due to academic dishonesty and no appeal option exists, the student must discontinue attending the class in which the academic dishonesty incident occurred. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty In determining a sanction, the responsible student's present demeanor and past disciplinary his tory, the nature of the offense, the severity of any resulting damage, injury or harm, and other factors may be considered. Students whose 88 October 26, 2016 behavior is contrary to the Code of Conduct are subject to the maximum sanction of dismissal from the University or any lesser sanction for any act of misconduct. Academic dishonesty sanctions include, but are not limited, to information below. Faculty and the academic dean (or designee) may assign the sanctions of repeating an assignment, receiving a score of zero on an exam/assignment, receiving a lowered assignment/exam/course grade, or failing the course. The Dean of Students (or designee) assigns the sanctions of warning, disciplinary probation, deferred suspension, suspension, or expul sion in accordance with the University Academic Honesty Policy and the University student discipline system. The Dean of Students (or designee) communicates academic honesty offenses, academic sanctions, and disciplinary sanctions to the student in writing subsequent to a case's bein g closed. Students are subject to academic sanctions from College of the Fenway faculty should they commit academic violations while taking a COF course, and such cases are referred to the Office of Student Affairs . MCPHS would address such offenses unde r the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy and Student Discipline Procedures. MCPHS D ocumented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure Absences from classes and coursework can be detrimental to students' academic progress. In an effort to help students in certain circumstances, a documented absence may be granted as a reasonable allowance; however, a documented absence does not always exc use a student from making up academic work. Each course syllabus and academic program's policy and procedure manual outline students' responsibilities related to class absences. Students are expected to abide by these instructions; students who fail to do so may be ineligible to receive an excused documented absence, regard less of reason for the absence. The procedure for seeking an approved documented absence and consideration for making up exams, coursework, clinical/rotation hours, or any other academ ic work for credit is outlined below: Procedure for Obtaining a Documented Absence 1. Notification In the case of an absence (anticipated or urgent), every effort must be made to notify course faculty or preceptor and the Student Affairs office . Email notification is preferred. Regardless of the situation, a student must notify his/her course faculty or preceptor of the absence, and present supporting documentation within 5 business days from the first date of absence to the office that handles such requests on each campus. Notification of clinical preceptors must comply with expectations outlined in clinical rotation syllabi and handbooks. For online courses, refer to course syllabus and the attendance requirements outlined by the faculty member . Anticipated absences include religious observance and immutable appointments (i.e., jury duty, court date, medical appointment, University -related conference, professional development). It is recommended that all requests for anticipated absences be ma de 10 days in advance of the absence date(s). Exceptions to the 5 -business -day notification period are rare and can be approved only by the Dean of Students on a student's respective campus. 2. Submitting Documented Absence Request Form Students must submit a completed Documented Absence Request Form with valid documentation via this link: http://tinyurl.com/mcphs -absence . See Required Documentation and/or Meeting section below. Students with three or more documented absences in one semester in a si ngle course will be required to meet with the Dean of Students or designee on their respective campus . 3. Notification The Student Affairs office will render a decision within two to three business days (or longer), and accordingly, the student and the course faculty will be notified of the decision via email. 4. Missed Work and Make -Up Process Once a documented absence has been approved, it is th e responsibility of the student to contact the instructor within 24 hours to arrange make -up coursework. Course instructors will be asked to make reasonable arrangements (consistent with the syllabus) to assist the student in completing requirements of the missed coursework or exam. The following information is imperative to making up missed work and/or exam(s): 89 October 26, 2016 It is expected that any missed work or assignments be submitted appropriately; however, the maximum make -up period shall be within seven busine ss days of return or at the discretion of the faculty member. Students who anticipate an absence from clinical or lab experiences must make every effort to identify a classmate to switch hours with, in consultation with the student's clinical coordinato r (not applicable for all academic programs). Students may be required to repeat a rotation due to the absence. Students may be required to take an exam before the absence or at the discretion of the faculty member. Students are responsible for ob taining class/lab notes for missed material. While a student may be granted an excused absence, some absences may not justify make -up work because faculty may not be able to replicate the experience. In such cases, this policy should be in the syllabus and the determination made by the school dean in collaboration with the instructor. If an acceptable agreement between the student and professor(s) cannot be reached regarding completion of missed work, the school dean or designee will serve as arbitra tor. Required Documentation and/or Meeting Bereavement: Documentation is needed for a student absence lasting three days or fewer for the death of an immediate family member. A copy of the obituary, funeral service card, or death certificate is require d. A meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus is required for an excused absence request for bereavement lasting more than three days or where travel to another country or U.S. region is required. Immediate family is defined as grandparent, parent/guardian, sibling, child, or spouse/partner. Religious observance:* Documentation is not needed if the holy day is listed in the interfaith calendar. A meeting with the Dean of Students or designee on a student's respective campus is required for an excused absence request for religious observance for a holy day that is not listed as a holy day in the interfaith calendar. Family emergency: Documentation is needed for a student absenc e lasting three days or fewer for an immediate family member's hospitalization or other emergency. A meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus is required for an absence lasting more than three days that is related to a family emergency. Immediate family is defined as parent/guardian, sibling, child, or spouse/partner. Illness / medical reason: Student absence related to illness or medical care requires documentation from a healthcare provider. Documentation includes a letter or information on letterhead from the office of a physician or medical clinic. If the student requires recovery time these dates should be included in the documentation. If a student has a contagious illness (e.g., H1N1), or has surgery, the University may r equire the student to present a second medical notice clearing him/her to return to campus and/or a clinical site. Immutable appointment: Student absence lasting three days or fewer for jury duty, court date related to personal safety/well -being, or Un iversity -related conference (i.e., career days, ACPE professional development). Documented absences for a period of more than three days require a meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus. For a student who has three or more documented absences in one semester for a single course or clinical experience, a meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus is required. Documented absences for circumstances not covered above should be directed to the Student Affairs office on your campus . *Religious observance: With respect to students, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 151C, section 2B, reads in relevant part as follows: Any student in an educational or vocational training institution ... who is unable, because of his religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examina tion or study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study or work requirement which he may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided, however, that such make -up examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such school. 90 October 26, 2016 No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the said student such opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his a vailing himself of the provisions of this section. Documented absences are not granted for the following (please note this is not an inclusive list): Plane reservations after the start of the term or during midterm or final exam periods Weather cond itions (with special exceptions) Transportation/ commuter issues Poor time management Travel for a holiday or appointment Instructor Absence If a faculty member is unable to conduct classes as scheduled, every effort will be made to offer substitute instruction for the students. Planned absences due to professional commitments should be approved by the school dean well in advance so that suitab le coverage or alternative assignments may be arranged. The school dean should be informed as soon as possible of any unplanned absences due to illness or personal emergency so that students can be notified in a timely manner. Classes can be canceled only with the approval of the school dean or, in his or her absence, the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Academic Progress The academic standing of each student will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester at each campus, including summer sessio ns. All students will be reviewed by the school in which they are enrolled. Summer sessions are reviewed to evaluate student academic progress. Each school has specific academic progress standards (e.g., minimum grade point average requirements, minimum grades for required courses) that must be met in order to progress within the degree program (see Good Academic Standing). Students who fail to meet the minimum standards required for academic progress will be notified of the decision by the school 's Academ ic Standing Committee (ASC) . Academic Warning Faculty members submit academic warnings at the mid -point of each semester via WebAdvisor which are then processed by designated assistant deans/ directors of the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on each campus. Undergraduate students receiving academic warnings will be notified by email message to his or her official MCPHS email account. Undergraduate students receiving two or more academ ic warnings will also receive a notification letter from their school dean with additional instructions. Students in graduate programs who receive academic warnings will be notified by their academic departments/programs by email to their official MCPHS emails and provided additional instructions. Boston: Each student placed on academic warning will be encouraged to attend academic skill -building workshops and to meet with their student success coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. Th ese actions may be required of students who receive more than one academic warning (as stipulated in a letter from their school dean). Worcester/Manchester: Each student placed on academic warning will be required (as stipulated in his or her notificati on letter) to meet with a graduate enrichment coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Worcester/Manchester) and meet with a faculty advisor. There is no appeal process associated with academic warning. Academic Probation Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester, and each student's professional (if applicable) and cumulative grade point averages (GPAs) will be determined. A student with a professional and/or cumulative GPA below the requirement for his or her major shall be placed on academic probation and receive a letter from the chair of the ASC so stating. This written notice of probationary status also will include a notice that failure to reach the required GPA by the end of the designated academic semester may result in dismissal from the University. Each student on probation is required to meet with a designated member of the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on their home campus by the end of the second week of the probationary semester to develop and 91 October 26, 2016 agree to \u2014in writing \u2014an academic improvement plan (AIP). The AIP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student success. Probationary status may remain in effect for up to two consecutive academic terms, defined as two semesters or two clinical clerkships, depending upon the student's year and/or campus of enrollment. It is expected that stud ents on probation make progress toward good academic standing at the conclusion of each academic term. Failure to demonstrate improvement at the end of the first probationary period may result in dismissal. At the conclusion of the second consecutive acade mic term, the student must have achieved good academic standing; failure to do so may result in dismissal. Upon completion of each academic term, a student on academic probation will receive a notice of his or her current standing in writing from the schoo l dean . Individual programs may have specific grade point requirements that students must meet in order to enter the professional years and associated clerkships of their programs. These program -specific requirements preempt the probation process for the preprofessional years. For information about program -specific requirements for the professional years, students should contact the appropriate school dean and refer to the Good Academic Standing chart . There is no appeals process associated with academic p robation. Academic Dismissal Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester by the appropriate ASC. Each student's professional (if applicable) and cumulative GPAs will be determined. If a student's GPA falls below the level of good academic stand ing, as defined by the program requirements, for two consecutive academic semesters, the ASC will submit a recommendation for dismissal from the program to the appropriate school dean. Courses may be attempted no more than two times. Grades of F and W ar e considered attempts for courses in which D or better is the passing grade. For those courses in which the passing grade is higher (e.g., C -, C), grades below the passing grade and W are all considered attempts. Failure to complete any course within these limits will result in an ASC recommendation for dismissal from the degree program to the school dean. Individual programs may have specific grade point requirements that students must meet in order to enter the professional years and associated clerkship s of their programs. These program -specific requirements preempt the dismissal process for the preprofessional years, and students failing to meet them may be subject to dismissal. For information about program -specific requirements for the professional ye ars, students should contact the appropriate school dean and refer to the Good Academic Standing chart . A student recommended for dismissal may be continued by the school dean with or without conditions. If the school dean accepts the dismissal recommenda tion, the student will receive written notice of dismissal from the school dean. The notice will include procedures for appeal and will direct students to meet with an advisor to discuss a potential change of program. All change of programs must be finali zed by the end of the add/drop period for the next enrolled semester. If students do not successfully appeal or meet the change of program deadline they will be administratively withdrawn from the university. Administrative withdrawal letters will includ e notice of loss of housing, financial aid, and registration. The following offices/individuals will be notified: Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, Dean of Students, Office of the Registrar, Residence Life Office, Information Services, Public Saf ety, Student Financial Services and Immigration Services/International Academic Services (if app licable) . Students will be required to turn in their University ID and vacate University residence halls. A student whose conduct is unsatisfactory may be dism issed from the University at any time. In such a case, tuition and fees paid for the current academic semester will not be refunded. Reinstatement of Dismissed Students To be considered for readmission following dismissal by a school dean, the student mu st petition the Provost's Office, in writing, by the date designated in the appeals procedure guidelines that accompany the dismissal letter. The Provost's Office may uphold the dismissal, readmit the student, or readmit the student with conditions. If rea dmitted, the student's academic performance will be reviewed at the end of one academic semester. If the student has failed to meet the stipulated conditions or, in the absence of stipulated conditions, failed to meet the minimum GPA required for good acad emic standing in that student's program, the student will be dismissed from the University. A student who has been dismissed twice is eligible for readmission to the same degree program only if (1) the student has been away from the University for a perio d of 12 months, and (2) the student has demonstrated academic success through coursework taken at another institution. If these conditions are met, the student may apply for readmission to 92 October 26, 2016 the school dean. Readmission also will depend upon the availability of space in the program. A student may apply for readmission to another degree program after the first or second dismissal. The student must meet with an academic advisor in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment to initiate the internal transfer process described in the Change of Program section below. All materials required for this process must be finalized by the end of the add/drop period for the next enrolled semester . All of the program's internal transfer requirements (available from the school dean's office) must be met. Auditing Courses \u2014No Credit A student may audit a course with the consent of the instructor. The student must register for the course through the Office of the Registrar and pay two -thirds of the tuition. The student does not earn academic credit for audited courses. Students cannot audit courses that are part of their required curriculum. Change of Program (Boston) A student requesting an internal change of program must schedule an appointment with the Center for Academi c Success and Enrichment (CASE) to discuss with an advisor the decision to apply for a change of program. Prior to this meeting, the student must have a printed copy (from WebAdvisor) of the most recent program evaluation and a program evaluation for the n ew major. These audits should be brought to the meeting with the advisor. Students must initiate their request for additional transfer credit for coursework completed prior to matriculation during the meeting with the advisor. When a new major has been ch osen, the student may be required to schedule an appointment with the director of the program to which he or she wishes to transfer. The CASE (Boston) will submit to the program director a request for change of student status form, the program evaluation, and a \"what -if\" program evaluation, as well as a letter stating the reasons for transfer. All program internal transfer requirements (available from the school dean's office) must be met. If the student is accepted into the new program in good standing, wr itten notification of acceptance (in the form of a signed Request for Change of Student Status form approved by the school dean) is sufficient notification. If the student is accepted into the new program on probation, a letter notifying the student of his or her probationary status will be attached to the Request for Change of Student Status form and sent to the school dean for approval and signature. Once accepted, the program director will determine, if applicable, the new year of graduation (YOG). The s tudent, the advisor, the program director, and the appropriate school dean must sign the Request for Change of Student Status form. All written correspondence regarding the decision must be sent to the student, program director, Office of the Registrar, St udent Financial Services, CASE , and school dean(s). If students have outstanding coursework taken external to MCPHS, the official transcripts must be received in the Office of the Registrar no later than the add/drop deadline for the term of entr y. Final a cceptance into the new program will remain pending until transfer coursework has been approved. In order to register for classes in the new program, the completed and approved request for change of student status form must be on file in the Office of the Registrar and the C ASE. Once admitted to a new program, a student must adhere to the program and GPA requirements commensurate with his or her new YOG. Depending on the intended new program, first -year students may change majors only after grades have bee n reviewed following the fall or spring semester or, in the case of the PharmD, the spring semester of the second year. Students may begin the change -of-major process early, but they must meet with an advisor in the CASE to review the change -of- major proce dures, petition, and timeline, and then meet again at the final stage of the process. If a student moves from the Worcester/Manchester PharmD program to any program in Boston, he or she will receive transfer credit for any courses that would be applied to the degree program, and the secondary degree would begin with a new degree audit. In this case, the residency requirement would be waived. Students cannot transfer from the Worcester or Manchester PharmD program into the Boston PharmD program. Recalculat ion of the Grade Point Average Students who have been accepted into a new program and wish to remove courses from their grade point average that are not required for the new major should note their request on the Request for Change of Student Status form. All grades will remain on the transcript (and program evaluation), with the notation that they are not included in the grade point average. Students who leave a program not in good academic standing and wish to move to another degree program or be readmit ted to their former program must meet the grade point requirements of that YOG and program (see Good Academic Standing). Students who leave the Pharm D program not in good standing must complete the new program and meet the grade point average requirement r equired by the School of Pharmacy -Boston before seeking readmission 93 October 26, 2016 to a student's original program. Any courses removed from the grade point calculation that are required for the original degree program will be added back to the GPA calculation prior to consideration for readmission. Conduct of Classes Admission to Classes No student will be admitted to a scheduled class unless the student's name is on the instructor's class roster and the student's account is in order . Attendance The University expects students to meet attendance requirements in all courses in order to qualify for credit. Attendance requirements may vary depending on the instructor, and these should be clearly stated in the syllabus available to each student during the first week of the course. Generally, students are expected to attend all classes unless they have a valid excuse. (See Documented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure). Student Conduct An instructor shall have the right to require a student who is disruptive during a class, laboratory, or experiential rotatio n to leave for the remainder of the session and shall report the incident to the Student Affairs office on their campus for further appropriate action in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct. Instructional Periods Faculty members are expected not to continue any class beyond the scheduled ending time. Unless students have been informed that the faculty member will be late, cla ss is canceled if a faculty member has not arrived within 10 minutes of the scheduled starting time of a class. Online and Distance Education Classes The majority of courses at MCPHS are conducted in physical classrooms and labs. However, in addition to programs offered entirely online, some required and elective courses may be delivered online and/or through distance education. In participating in online or distance education courses, students learn in different ways and must manage a technologically mediated environment. This learning will be of value both in the completion of degree requirements and in the workplace . Increasingly, workplaces utilize technology for training and work. Please see the MCPHS Online section for suggestions for taking online courses. Minimum Class Size By noon on the Friday of the first week of classes, the school dean will make the following decision regarding offering a class, based on enrollment: Required courses will be offered unless offered more than once in a calendar year. If five or fewer students register for a required course that is offered more than once in a calendar year, the course may be canceled (programmatic requirements considered). Elective courses will be offered provided there is a minimum of eight students enrolled. Registration It is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure that only properly registered students are allowed to attend class. If a student's name does not appear on the class roster in WebAdvisor after the add/drop period , that student shall not be allowed to attend, participate in, or take or receive exams until the instructor is notified by the Office of the Registrar that the student is officially registered. 94 October 26, 2016 Course Policies Academic Honesty (See Academic Honesty Policy under University Policies & Procedures section of the University Catalog) . Credit Hour Policy The credit hour policy applies to all courses at all levels (graduate, professional and undergraduate) that award academic credit regardless of the mode of delivery including, but not limited to, self -paced, online, hybrid, lecture, research, clinical and laboratory. Academic units are responsible for ensuring that credit hours are awarded only for work that meets the requirements outlined in this policy . A lecture period of 50 minutes per week or laboratory work of 110 to 220 minutes per week, extending over one semester, constitutes one academic credit hour. For each hour of lecture, students are expected to spend a minimum of two hours outside of class preparing for the course. For research, clinical/experiential rotations and service learning activities, actual hours may vary by program, but such activities must include an amount of work that is at least equivalent to lecture and laboratory courses. Assessment All materials , in whatever format, submitted by students for evaluation in MCPHS courses may be used by MCPHS for program or institutional assessment. To the extent possible, individual identification will be removed fr om these materials before they are used for assessment purposes. Colleges of the Fenway A Colleges of the Fenway ( COF ) student enrolled in an MCPHS course through COF cross-registration must notify the course instructor and provide her or him with an email address to ensure that course information is received in a timely manner. The student also should consult with the instructor regarding access to online applications that might be used in the course. Disabilities Students with documented disabilitie s who wish to request accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act should contact the Office of Disability Support Services at 617.879.5925 (Boston students) or the Director of the Center for Academic S uccess and Enrichment at 508.373.5608 (Worcester/Manchester students) to discuss the accommodations process. Writing -Intensive Courses (for all HUM courses and others designated as writing intensive) The MCPHS faculty believes that learning in all disciplines is an integrative process, a synthesis of critical reading, thinking, and writing. Students not only must learn to write but also must write to learn. Consequently, writing -intensive courses requi re students to write 15 to 20 pages in two or more assignments that may take various forms as determined by the course instructor. In addition, instructors dedicate class time to the teaching of writing in their specific disciplin es, provide feedback on as signments, and allow revision of at least one assignment. Writing Proficiency Requirement (Boston only) MCPHS -Boston students in all baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are expected to meet the University 's standards for writing proficie ncy, which include the general standards for writing competency as delineated in the University 's writing proficiency rubric, and specific applications of those standards by faculty in disciplines across the University curricula. Students who do not perform at a satisfactory level of writing proficiency may be referred to the Writing Center and may be required to demonstrate writing improvement to receive full course credit. (For details, see the Writing Proficiency Requirement \u2014Boston section of this catalog.) The writing proficiency rubric is available on the Writing Center Web page at https:// my.mcphs.edu. Courses Taken at Other Colleges after Matriculation Once a student has matriculated at the University, no courses taken off campus will be accept ed for transfer credit. (NOTE: COF courses are allowed for Boston students.) Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Provost's Office in instances involving delay of graduation or extreme hardship. In these instances, course approval must be obtain ed from the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment . Students are advised not to enroll in or make payments for non - MCPHS courses without official University approval. 95 October 26, 2016 Credit by Examination Credit by examination is available to students whose previous coursework in a subject area does not meet transfer credit criteria or who feel they have achieved competency in a subject through work or life experience. Credit by examination is available to new students only during the student's first semester of matri culation at the University , no later than the add/drop deadline of the term of entry. Competency may be demonstrated through one of the following means: ( 1) College Level Examination Program (CLEP ), (2) Advanced Placement (AP) examination , or (3) International Baccalaureate (IB) examination. The College Board administers CLEP and AP examinations. A passing score on the CLEP examination in English Composition with Essay will be accepted as credit for Expository Writing I. A passing score on the C LEP examination in Freshman College Composition with Essay will be accepted as credit for Expository Writing II. CLEP credit will be awarded only after the Admission Office has received official scores directly from the College Board. In the case of AP examinations, credit will be awarded for a score of 4.0 or higher. No AP credit will be awarded for CHE 131 Chemical Principles I, CHE 132 Chemical Principles II, CHE 110 Basic Chemistry I, or CHE 210 Basic Chemistry II. No AP credit will be awarded to stude nts in the Premedical and Health Studies program for BIO 151 Biology I or BIO 152 Biology II. AP and IB exceptions: Chemistry AP scores of 4 or better will be accepted as transfer credit for CHE 131 and CHE 132 for students who matriculate at MCPHS with e xisting college credit for organic chemistry. Transfer students accepted into the professional phase of an MCPHS degree program will receive transfer credit for IB courses accepted by a previous college. In both of these instances, official AP and/or IB ex am documentation must be provided to MCPHS no later than the add /drop deadline of the term of entry. Students who complete IB courses must provide high school transcripts and/or IB reports that document the course, examination level, and exam score. Studen ts must achieve a score of 5 or better on an HL (high -level) IB exam. Transfer credits are limited to exams for English, language, or the arts. Students are responsible for scheduling CLEP/AP examinations through the College Board. Results/scores of the examination(s) should be sent (by the school dean if applicable) to the Admission Office. If the student achieves an acceptable score on the examination(s), then notification will be sent to ( 1) the student, ( 2) the program director, ( 3) the school dean, ( 4) the Office of the Registrar, ( 5) the Academic Advising Center / advisor, and ( 6) others as appropriate. Credit earned by examination will not be counted toward the residency requirement. Clinical Rotations and Background Screenings For some MCPHS progra ms, placements in clinical rotations at healthcare providers are a required part of the MCPHS curriculum. Some of those healthcare providers require background screenings , and a conviction for a criminal offense might present an issue. It is possible that certain types of criminal convictions, whether prior to being a student at MCPHS or while attending MCPHS, could preclude a student from being able to complete a required clinical rotation. For more information, please contact the MCPHS Chief Compliance Officer. Cross -Registration (Boston) Cross -registration provides full -time undergraduates of the Colleges of the Fenway with the opportunity to take up to two courses per semester (fall and spring semesters) at any of the six Colleges of the Fenway institutions at no additional charge, so long as the credit load does not exceed 18 semester hours. This opportunity provides students with the advantages of a small college but exposes them to resources similar to those of a large university. Cross -registration enables students to broaden their intellectual and social capacities, and it introduces them to faculty, research, colleagues, and curricula they would not otherwise have experienced. Students in good academic and financial standing may cross -register after students at the home institution have completed the preregistration process. Courses are open to cross -registration on a seat -available basis. Each school's home students have the first option to register for courses that have been developed through joint efforts of faculty across the schools, and the goal of these courses is to attract a mix of students. A searchable database of all courses open for cross -registra tion may be found at www.colleges -fenway.org . Detailed information about cross -registration and associated processes and policies is highlighted on the College s of the Fenway website (www.colleges -fenway.org). When a course offered through the Colleges of the Fenway require s MCPHS students to be absent from their own institution 's (MCPHS 's) classes for no more than one week , the absence is considered an excused absence. Students enrolled in such courses are expected to meet all other academic requirements, working individually with faculty to make up work. 96 October 26, 2016 Dean's List The dean's list recognizes full -time students seeking a bachelor's degree or doctor of pharm acy who have completed the required full -time semester hours of credit and earn a minimum 3.50 semester GPA. Courses that are taken pass/fail do not count toward the full -time status. Doctor of Pharmacy students in Boston, Worcester, and Manchester who are completing clinical rotations are not eligible for the dean's list. Doctor of Pharmacy students i n the Worcester and Manchester programs during the six -week fall semester of Year II are eligible for the dean's list. Incomplete grades that remain beyond the first three weeks of the subsequent semester render a student ineligible for the dean's list in that term. Dean's list is not awarded to students in graduate programs (i.e., MPAS, MANP, MSN, MSDH, MS, DPT, OD, and PhD). The dean's list is published approximately one mon th into the following semester. Add/Drop Procedures A registered student who wish es to adjust his or her class schedule during the designated add/drop period can make adjustments online via WebAdvisor. Students cross -registered for Colleges of the Fenway courses must adhere to the add/drop procedures at their home institution. The add/ drop period deadline for all programs is specified for each academic term, usually within the first week of classes. Adjustments to tuition and fees, where applicable, are made automatically through the Office of Student Financial Services. Students who wi sh to withdraw from a course after the designated add/drop period should refer to the Withdrawal from a Course section in Academic Policies and Procedures . No refunds are made if such changes are made after the designated add/drop period. NOTE: Simply failing to attend classes will not result in the course being dropped from the student's official registration, and students will be held financially accountable and receive a course grade of F. Email Policy All MCPHS students are required t o open, utilize, and maintain (i.e., keep storage within the maximum set by the Department of Information Services) an MCPHS email account. Official University communications and notices are sent via MCPHS email accounts. All students are responsible for r egularly checking their MCPHS email and for the information contained therein. Only MCPHS accounts will be used in all matters related to academics, student life, and University notifications. The University does not forward MCPHS email to personal email a ccounts. NOTE: All MCPHS community members may voluntarily register in the MCPHS Emergency Notification System to receive text messages via cell phones and email regarding major campus emergencies and campus closings. Contact helpdesk@mcphs.edu for more information. Examinations All tests and examinations, other than final examinations, are scheduled by the instructor. Students who miss a scheduled examination (i.e., classroom examination , lab, or other graded performance) and are granted an excused abse nce for the missed examination (see Documented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure ) must arrange a make -up exam with the course instructor. The format of the make -up exam may vary from that of the original scheduled exam and is at the discretion of the course instructor. With respect to completion of such examinations, if an acceptable agreement between the student and professor(s) cannot be reached, the school dean will serve as arbitrator. During the fall and spring semesters for undergraduate and first professional degree students, no course examinations (worth 15 % or more of the final course grade) may be scheduled during the week before final examinations. Major written assignments may be due the week before finals if the assignments were semester -long and not assigned within the last four weeks of the semester. Exceptions are granted for laboratory examinations, including practical examinations. Exceptions also may be granted for block -scheduled courses, subject to approval by the Vice President for Academic Affairs ( see School of Nursing, Boston, Worcester/Manchester) . NOTE: Final examinations are scheduled by the Office of the Registrar several weeks before the end of the semester. Final examinations must be given only during final exam week. The final exam schedule includes make -up times for examinations canceled due to inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances (e.g., power outages, fire alarms). Students and faculty are expect ed to take these dates into account when planning any travel (i.e., they should not purchase nonrefundable tickets to leave before the make -up date). Posting Examination Grades Faculty do not use student identification number s to post exam grades. Quiz, exam, and assignment grades are posted on BlackboardTM via the use of student -specific log -ons and confidential passwords. Please remember that passwords should be kept confidential. Final Grades 97 October 26, 2016 Students may view their final gr ades online via WebAdvisor. Final grades are not available to students until all grades have been submitted by all faculty. The Registrar's Office will notify students via email when all grades are posted each term. Good Academic Standing To be in good a cademic standing, a student's cumulative and professional grade point averages must meet the minimums required by the degree program in which he or she is enrolled. Any student whose cumulative or professional average falls below the minimum after an acade mic term is considered to be on probation. Professional grade point averages are calculated only after 12 credits have been taken in professional courses (exceptions exist for the Nursing program). Cumulative or professional grade point average minimums ar e listed in the Good Academic Standing table in this section. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards required for academic progression will be notified of the decisions by the school 's Academic Standing Committee. In order to maintain good academic standing, students should be aware that the professional curricula of the University are rigorous and demanding. Students who must be engaged in gainful employment should balance school and work responsibilities so as not to compromise their academic success. Good Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress for Financial Aid Student Financial Services disburses financial aid only to students in good academic standing who are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degrees. Refer to Student Financial Services in this catalog for further details. Grading Policies Grade Appeals A student who wishes to appeal a course grade must do so within two weeks of the grade being posted by the Registrar's Office. Stude nts are encouraged to meet with their advisor or student success coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) to discuss the grade appeal process. The first appeal should be in writing to the instructor, who must make a decision to uphold or change the grade within 3 business days of the appeal. The written appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal. If a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be reached (or the instructor does not respond within 3 business days), the student has 3 business days to appeal in writing to the administrator in charge of the academic unit offering the course (Department Chair, Program Director or designee). The appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal and the result of the appeal to the instruc tor. The academic unit administrator must decide to uphold or change the grade within 3 business days of the appeal. If this procedure does not successfully resolve the matter (or if the administrator does not rule on the matter in 3 business days), the student has 3 business days to appeal in writing to the chief administrator (School Dean or designee) overseeing the academic unit offering the course. The appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal and the results of the appeals to the instructor and the academic unit administrator. The chief administrator will uphold or change the grade and inform the student within three business days. The decision of the chief administrator is final. Decisions on grade appeals are based solely on objective grad e information. If the grade appeal affects a student's progression status, the grade appeal process must be completed on or before the first day of class/clinical rotation, prior to the start of the next semester. It is the student's responsibility to ini tiate the grade appeal. Grade Point Average The total number of quality points (see Grading System section of this catalog ), divided by the total number of credit hours taken, yields the grade point average. The grade point average for each semester and c umulatively is calculated to two decimal points. In some degree programs, a professional grade point average also is calculated for each student by dividing the number of professional quality points by the total number of professional credit hours taken. Grade Reports At the end of each academic term, students can view their grades online via WebAdvisor . The Office of the Registrar notifies students when grades are posted. 98 October 26, 2016 Good Academic Standing Chart Good Academic Standing School Program Degree Overall GPA Prof. GPA Min.

The instructor is responsible for notifying the Office of the Registrar regarding any student who has been granted additional time for coursework completion. The instructor also must specify the extended time period , up to one semester. No student may progress to courses for which the course with an Incomplete is a prerequisite until the work is completed and the I grade is changed. Incomplete grades render a student ineligible for the dean's list . No student can graduate with an Incomplete grade in any course necessary for graduation. 103 October 26, 2016 Pass/Fail Courses A maximum of one elective course may be taken on a pass/fail basis at another institution, including the Colleges of the Fenway. A grade of P or F will appear on the MCPHS transcript for any course taken pass/fail. A pass/fail course will not affect a student's grade point average. However, a failure in such a course may have an impact on progression through the curriculum. Repeated Courses Following completion of a course repeated at MCPHS, the earlier grade will be removed from the grade point average, and the more recent grade will be used in the calculation. Both grades remain on the transcript for future reference. If the student repeats a course outside the University (see Courses Taken at Other Colleges after Matriculation), the lower grade is dropped from the grade point average, but a substitute grade is not used in the calculation. Such courses are listed as transfer credit. Courses may be attempted no more than two times. Grades of F and W are considered attempts for courses in which D or better is the passing grade. For those courses in which the passing grade is higher (e.g., C -, C), grades below the passing grade and W are all considered attempts. Failure to complete any course within these limits will result in dismissal from the degree program or major. When a curriculum change results in a course moving from one category to another (e.g., from preprofessional to profes sional), and a student repeats the course in the new category, the GPA will automatically be calculated in the new category. If the student wants the GPA to be calculated in the previous category, he or she must state the justification for that request via a petition for special academic request. The request is not automatically approved, and the repeated course will not be counted in both professional and preprofessional categories. Replacement of F Grades The registrar will automatically replace the previous grade when a student repeats a course. Students are encouraged to review their current program evaluation with the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment to determine if there are existing grades th at should be replaced. The timely replacement of grades is essential in determining the academic standing of students. Graduation Policies Eligibility The University recognizes three graduation dates during the academic year: September 15; December 15; a nd a specified date in May. A formal Commencement ceremony is held once per year for all campuses , in May. In order to be eligible to receive a degree on one of the above official graduation dates, students must complete all degree requirements (including coursework, experiential education, instructional requirements, and financial clearance) by the following deadlines : May Last day of spring semester final exam period* September Last day of summer session II December Last day of fall semester final exam period* * All requested exceptions for students to process at Commencement with minimal requirements pending must be approved by the Office of Student Affairs one month prior to the Commencement date. Students who have completed degree requir ements by the last day of the spring semester final exam period, or who earned their degree the previous September or December, are eligible to participate in the formal May Commencement ceremony . Students who will complete all degree requirements by the l ast day of summer session II are eligible to participate. Students are eligible to participate in the Commencement ceremony only as noted above. In the event of incomplete requirements (including outstanding financial balances), the school dean will make a change in the student's date of graduation (via the Change of Year of Graduation form). It is the responsibility of the individual student to ensure that he or she meets all degree requirements on schedu le or risk delay in graduation. 104 October 26, 2016 Graduation with Honors Summa cum laude 3.86-4.00 Magna cum laude 3.70-3.85 Cum laude The determination of honors is based on the graduate's final cumulative grade point average. Only s tudents seeking a first bachelor's degree or doctor of pha rmacy who have com pleted at least 60 credits at MCPHS are eligible for honors. Honors designations appear on the student's final grade transcript but not on the diploma. First honor graduates are recognized during the May Commencement ceremony. In order to be considered a first honor graduate, one must be a student in a full -time undergraduate or entry -level program with at least three years of residency (except Nursing, PA -Worcester/Manchester and Fast Track Dental Hygiene) and must not have earned any graduate or other a dvanced degree. Petition to Graduate Students must file a Petition to Graduate form online. Deadlines for submitting the forms also are posted online. Upon determination of completed requirements, students will be approved for graduation. In the event of incomplete requirements, the school dean will make a change in the student's year of graduation (YOG) via the Change of YOG form. The student will be notified of this change and encouraged to meet with his or her program director and/or the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston , Worcester /Manchester) to ensure satisfactory program completion within the new YOG. All tuition and fees must be paid to the University prior to graduation. Year of Graduation Whenever a student falls out of s equence in the curriculum of an academic program, takes a leave of absence, or changes program, a change of year of graduation (YOG) may be necessary. If requesting to change programs, a student must complete a Change of YOG form as part of the request to the school dean. The form must be signed by an academic advisor. The program director and school dean will review the request for change of YOG as part of the acceptance process. The completed and signed Change of YOG form will be distributed to (1) the sc hool dean, (2) the student, (3) the Office of the Registrar, (4) Student Financial Services, (5) the program director, and (6) the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston , Worcester/Manchester). Leave of Absence The University recognizes that there are situations when a student may require a leave of absence. A student must be in good academic and financial standing to apply for a leave of absence. Such leaves are granted for a maximum of one academic year. The student must meet with their Aca demic Dean to request a leave of absence prior to their last date of attendance. After the initial meeting the student must submit the Leave of Absence Request form to their Academic Dean within 1 week (or 5 business days). The Leave of Absence Request f orm calls for the signatures of the: a) student, b) Academic Dean and c) Student Financial Services and d) Immigration Services representative (for international students). The Academic Dean will notify students if the leave is academically approved or de nied within 1 week (or 5 business days) via the student' s MCPHS email account. Students must confirm that they are returning to MCPHS University prior to March 1 for a summer or fall semester return and prior to October 1 for a spring semester return. A student who fails to return within the designated time must reapply for admission. Students on a Leave of Absence are not eligible for University Services, with the exception of academic advising three to four weeks prior to return to the University. Students who are on a leave of absence for one semester or longer from Dental Hygiene, Nursing, Physical Therapy or Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs must pass a competency exam and/or a Direct ed Study prior to re -enrollment. Double Majors (Boston) Students enrolled in selected BS degree programs (Boston) may declare a double major. Accelerated, degree completion, online, MPAS, Nursing, PharmD, Premedical and Health Studies, and Health Sciences programs cannot be used in double majors. In addition, a double major in Public Health and Health Psychology is not available. Students who declare a double major cannot complete a minor. In order to be eligible for a double major, the student must have a grade point average (GPA) of 3.2 or higher a nd have completed at least 30 credits. Once students have been approved for a double major, they are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 for the remainder of their studies. 105 October 26, 2016 Students should note that only one degree will be conferred. Due to schedul ing conflicts and/or additional course requirements, students may need to take more than 18 credits per semester and/or enroll in summer semester(s) in order to graduate with their class. In cases where courses overlap between majors, general elective cred it may need to apply to one of the courses. It is recommended that students check with Student Financial Services to discuss how the additional course requirements might affect their financial aid status. In order to be considered for a double major, candi dates should contact the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston) and complete the Application for Double Major form, which requires approval of relevant program directors and deans. Minor s (Boston) Students who wish to pursue a minor must comp lete a Declaration of Minor form, which is available from the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment . Students must obtain the signature of the faculty member responsible for coordinating the minor and the school dean. The Declaration of Minor form mus t be forwarded to (1) the student, (2) the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment , and (3) the Office of the Registrar. Requirements for completion of some minors vary for students in the Premedical and Health Studies program. These variations are out lined in the Bachelor of Science in Premedical and Health Studies section of this catalog. Premedical and Health Studies students must complete their program -specific Declaration of Minor form. Registration for Classes Prior to the start of preregistratio n for each term, the Registrar's Office will notify students (via MCPHS email) of the registration schedule. The schedule will indicate if students will be block registered for required courses or if students need to meet with Academic Advising before regi stering for classes. Students who register on time receive a n electronic bill from Student Financial Services. Students who miss the registration period are charged a late registration fee. Students who have outstanding balances are not allowed to register or attend classes until all bills are paid in full. Nonmatriculating Students In rare instances, students may register for courses at MCPHS prior to matriculation in a specific program. All prerequisites for a class must be satisfied and there must be room in the class. Credit will be accepted only for classes in which students earn a C or better in undergraduate courses or a B or better in graduate courses. The maximum number of credits allowed is 12 semester hours for undergraduate students and 6 semester hours for graduate students. Students must request to have these credits applie d to their degree; it is not automatic. Visiting Students Visiting students (those enrolled in degree programs at institutions other than members of the Colleges of the Fenway) also may register for classes at the University . Such students must provide do cumentation of good academic standing from their home institution before completing their registration. Visiting students may register on a seat -available basis and only after the designated period when matriculated students have completed the registration process. Such students may obtain registration materials at the Office of the Registrar. This same policy also applies to students from other MCPHS campuses. In the case of nonmatriculated and visiting students, it is expected that such students will ad here to the academic requirements as set forth by the instructor(s) and stated in the course syllabus. Residency Requirement Students must complete (1) at least half of the required credits for a degree and (2) all professional course requirements in the respective degree program in residence at MCPHS. In special cases, the school dean may allow transfer credit for professional courses provided the student is able to demonstrate competency in the subject. If a program does not have specified professional courses, then half of all credits must be taken in residence. At least one -half of the courses required for a minor must be completed while in residence at MCPHS. \"In residence\" is defined as being registered for and enrolled in MCPHS courses, whether the courses are delivered using traditional or distance delivery methods. Colleges of the Fenway courses are credited as MCPHS courses (including the number of credits). An exception to the residency requirement is granted to those who hold licensure in a disc ipline and are enrolled in an MCPHS baccalaureate degree completion option. The residency requirement for such students is a minimum of 30 semester credits of MCPHS -approved courses. BS Completion Policy In order to graduate with a BS degree at MCPHS Univ ersity, a student must complete the final 30 credits of their degree program enrolled in MCPHS University courses or through an MCPHS approved articulation agreement. 106 October 26, 2016 Transcripts Copies of official transcripts must be requested in writing and bear the si gnature of the requesting student. Current students may request transcripts online via WebAdvisor. Transcripts are furnished to designated institutions or authorized agencies only when the student submits a completed transcript authorization form. Transcri pts are issued to those students whose financial status with Student Financial Services is clear. Transfer Credit \u2014Prior to Acceptance Courses taken at other regionally accredited colleges or universities in the United States before the student was accepted to the University may receive MCPHS transfer credit provided that a minimum grade of C has been earned. No transfer credit may be awa rded for behavioral, basic science, or professional coursework that is more than 10 years old. Transfer Policy MCPHS does not award transfer credit for remedial or skills courses or other courses that are taught at levels below the first-year level at MCP HS. This includes English courses on sentence and paragraph structure or similar content courses below the level of LIB 111 (Expository Writing I ), mathematics courses in arithmetic or algebra if below the level of MAT 141 (Algebra and Trigonometry ), and b iology and chemistry courses below the level of the MCPHS first -year courses required for the program to which the student seeks entrance. Transfer courses will not be accepted as fulfillment of the core curriculum requirements in the liberal arts distribution areas if they are taught in the first year of a University curriculum. Liberal arts courses acceptable for transfer credit must have p rerequisite requirements and must be taken during the student's second or subsequent year in a University curriculum. Approval of Transfer Credit \u2014Post matriculation Once a student has matriculated at the University, no courses taken off campus will be accepted for transfer credit. (NOTE: Colleges of the Fenway courses are allowed for Boston students.) Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment in instances involving delay of graduation or extreme hardship. Prior to taking a course for transfer credit at another institution, students must submit a Petition to Transfer Credit form to the Center for Academic Success and Enr ichment , who approves or denies the petition. Notification of the decision will be distributed to (1) the Academic Advising Center, (2) the program director, (3) the school dean, (4) the Office of the Registrar, and (5) others as appropriate. The student i s responsible for requesting that official transcripts be sent to the Office of the Registrar, which will verify the credit and post a grade of TR in the student's transcript. Official transcript s must be received no later than the add/drop deadline of the subsequent semester. Minimum Transfer Grade The minimum grade for receiving transfer credit is C (2.0). PHY 270 Foundations of Physics I Students who, prior to matriculation at MCPHS, have completed either one semester of calculus -based physics or two semesters of algebra -based physics will receive transfer credit for PHY 270. To be eligible for transfer credit, the courses must have been completed at a college or university and grades of C or better must have been earned in each class. This policy appli es only to transfer credit requested for courses taken prior to matriculation at MCPHS. Studio Art and Performance Courses A maximum of one studio art or performance course may be taken for credit at another institution, including the Colleges of the Fen way. Studio art courses may be accepted for general elective credit only, not for liberal arts distribution credit. Visiting Classes A person may visit a class in which he or she is not officially enrolled only with prior consent of the instructor. Withdrawal Administrative Withdrawal Section 1: Administrative Withdrawal An administrative withdrawal will mean that a student's preregistration or registration, housing, meal plan, and financial aid for the current semester will be canceled. The student will be unable to register or preregister for any subsequent semester until the administrative withdrawal is resolved. A student may be administratively withdrawn by the University if any of the following conditions apply: 107 October 26, 2016 a. If, after due notice, the student fails to satisfy an overdue financial obligation to the University, consisting of tuition, loans, board, room fees, library charges, or other student charges, including student activities, health insurance, graduation fees, and other such fees as may be established by the University b. If the student fails to comply with certain administrative requirements, including, without limitation, the submission of immunization forms, satisfaction of technical standards , or completion of SEVIS registrati on c. If the student fails to attend classes during the first two weeks of the semester d. If the student fails to register for the coming semester Section 2: Effects of Administrative Withdrawal If a student is administratively withdrawn, his or her rec ord will indicate the withdrawal date and the reason code for administrative withdrawal. All courses for which a student is registered at the time of withdrawal will receive a grade of W until or unless the student is reinstated. The student shall not be allowed to preregister or register for a future semester. If a student has already preregistered at the time of withdrawal, all preregistration course requests will be canceled. The student shall receive no further material or notification from the reg istrar concerning University affairs once administratively withdrawn. Section 3: Procedures for Implementing Administrative Withdrawal The registrar will send a letter to a student administratively withdrawn from the University. The administrative withdrawal must be based on one of the grounds set forth in Section 1. Administrative withdrawal notifications are sent to the students via MCPHS email and a hard copy is also mailed to the home address on file. Section 4: Appeals and Reinstatement Admini strative withdrawal reinstatements must be resolved within two weeks of receipt of the administrative withdrawal notification letter. Appeals must be submitted by the student in writing to the Office of Student Affairs within one week of receiving the not ification. The appeal should include a description of the actions the student has taken to resolve the matter and the reasons why the student is entitled to reinstatement Appeals will be reviewed for reinstatement into the current term only. The Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the Dean or Program Director, Student Financial Services and Immigration Services (if applicable) will approve or deny the reinstatement within 1 week after receiving the student appeal letter. In semesters beyond t hose from which the student was administratively withdrawn, the student must file a readmission application by the stated deadline for enrollment in the next available semester. Health Leave of Absence Policy When a student's current physical or mental health condition precludes successful completion of his or her educational program, the student may receive a health leave of absence from the University and University residence hall, upon recommendation of the Dean of Students or designee. Normally, the leave of absence will result from the student's voluntary efforts. In exceptional circumstances, a student may be asked to leave the University or University residence hall involuntarily. This policy does not supersede the Student Code of Conduct. Violations of the Student Code of Conduct will be handled through the student disciplinary process as outlined in the MCPHS student handbook. Voluntary Health Leave of Absence If the student's behavior progresses to the point where the student is ( 1) unable to live independently, ( 2) unable to protect himself or herself in the community, or ( 3) unable to perform the essential functions of an educational program without requirin g substantial modification of the program, the student is eligible for and may request from the Dean of Students or designee (provided medical / mental health documentation from a licensed provider is presented) a health leave of absence from the Universit y and University residence hall, regardless of the time in the semester. In order to remove the conditions of the leave, the student must present evidence (documented evidence from a licensed medical/mental health care provider) that the behavior no longer precludes successful completion of an educational program, and the student may be requested t o meet with a member of the Office of Student Affairs . In most cases, at least one academic semester must have passed before readmission under a voluntary health leave of absence may be considered. If on a leave of absence, a student's record will indicate the leave date and the reason code for voluntary health leave. 108 October 26, 2016 All courses for which a student is registered at the time of leave will receive a grade of W , and the refund policy as outlined in the University catalog will be followed . Requests for special consideration regarding the refund policy (e.g., leave date beyond the refund date) may be made to the Office of Student Affairs . Involuntary Health Leave of A bsence The Dean of Students or designee may issue an involuntary health withdrawal, whether or not the student's behavior violates the Student Code of Conduct. An involuntary health leave of absence must involve a strong likelihood of a. serious risk of p hysical harm to the student himself or herself, manifested by evidence of threats of suicide or attempts at suicide or other serious bodily harm; b. serious risk of physical harm to other persons in the community, including an infectious condition or evide nce of homicidal or other violent behavior; and/or c. reasonable risk of physical impairment or injury to the student himself or herself because of impaired judgment that would not allow the student to live independently or protect himself or herself in th e community or not allow the student to perform the essential functions of an educational program without requiring substantial modification of the program. Process for Involuntary Leave of Absence Report and Initial Meeting Upon receiving a report docume nting the behavior(s) that indicate why a student should be put on involuntary health leave, the Dean of Students or designee will meet with the student regarding the report. Suspension Pending Determination The student may be suspended immediately from the University or University residence hall pending the determination of the involuntary health leave of absence when, on the basis of the information available, the University reasonably believes that the stud ent's continued presence on campus endangers the physical safety or well -being of himself or herself or others or seriously disrupts the educational process of the University . Either before suspension or as promptly as is feasible, the student will be give n the opportunity to be heard and present evidence as to why he or she should not be immediately suspended. Evaluation The Dean of Students or designee may inform the student orally or in writing that he or she must participate in a medical or mental hea lth evaluation conducted by one of the following: a. MCPHS Director of Counseling Services or designee (in the case of psychological disorder) b. An independent evaluator (licensed social worker, licensed mental health counselor, licensed psychologist [inc luding psychiatrist] , or licensed medical doctor) selected by the student at the student's expense The student must sign a release of information form authorizing the evaluator to consult with MCPHS staff regarding the evaluation. The evaluation must be completed within 24 hours of the date of written or verbal notice or as soon as reasonable, as determined by the Dean of Students or designee. The Dean of Students or designee may grant an extension for completion. If the student fails to complete or refu ses to participate in an evaluation when referred, he or she may be issued an involuntary health leave of absence. Determination Upon completion of the evaluation, the MCPHS staff member who conducts or consults in the evaluation will make a recommendatio n to the Dean of Students or designee. An opportunity must be provided for the student to discuss the recommendations with the MCPHS staff member who conducted or consulted in the evaluation and with the Dean of Students or designee. The student will be g iven the opportunity to be heard and present evidence as to why he or she should not be issued an involuntary health leave of absence. The Dean of Students or designee will make a determination and inform the student in writing. 109 October 26, 2016 Effective Date Once the i nvoluntary health leave of absence is issued, the terms of the leave become effective immediately. A student's record will indicate the leave date and the reason code for involuntary health leave. All courses for which a student is registered at the time o f leave will receive a grade of W , and the refund policy as outlined in the University catalog will be followed . Requests for special consideration regarding the refund policy (e.g., leave date beyond the refund date) may be made to the Dean of Students. The safety of the student while on campus must be assured. Advance notice of an involuntary health leave is recommended only when the safety of the student while on campus is assured. In the case of emergencies, no advance notice may be possible. Appeal A student who has been issued an involuntary health leave of absence may appeal the decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs in writing within five business days of receiving the decision. The student's reasons for the appeal and the desired reso lution must be indicated in the letter. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will consider the case within five business days of the request for an appeal. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is final and will be communicated to the student in writing. Return after Leave of Absence In order to remove the conditions of the leave of absence, the student must present medical documentation that the behavior no longer precludes successful completion of an educational program. The student also must participate in an evaluation conducted by University staff, by an established deadline, and write a letter to the Dean of Students or designee detailing the student's readiness to return to the University . In most cases, at least one academic sem ester must have passed before readmission under an involuntary health leave may be considered. Deviations from Established Policies Reasonable deviations from this policy will not invalidate a decision or proceeding unless significant prejudice to a stud ent may result. Withdrawal from a Course Students may withdraw from a course through the end of the 10th week of the fall or spring semester ; in the summer session, withdrawal must be by the end of the 3rd week. No refunds are given after the end of the official add/drop period. After the official add/drop period, students who choose to withdraw receive a grade of W for the course. The withdrawal slip must be signed by the student's advisor. Every registered student who remains in a course is given a grad e. Simply failing to attend classes does not constitute withdrawal. Withdrawal from the University A student must complete an exit interview with the Associate Dean for the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment or designee (Boston), Assistant Dean (Worcester), or Associate Dean of Students (Manchester) prior to withdrawing from the University. The student also must complete a withdrawal form, which calls for the signature of the Associate Dean for the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston) or designee, Assistant Dean for the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Worcester), or Associate Dean of Students (Manchester) and Student Financial Services. Failure to complete the withdrawal process resul ts in automatic failure in all courses in which the student is currently enrolled and forfeiture of any prorated tuition refund. Withdrawn students are not eligible for University services. 110 October 26, 2016 General Education Requirements Preprofessional, general education and liberal arts distribution requirements for all baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are summarized below. Course sequences for the preprofessional and professional curriculum in a particular degree program may be found in the specific sections pertaining to each of the University's schools and divisions. Placement in Mathematics Courses Students are placed in mathematics courses based on their math placement exam scores, SATs or ACTs, and degree programs. Any changes in assigned mathem atics courses must be discussed with and approved by the coordinator of mathematics in the School of Arts and Sciences during the add/drop period at the beginning of the fall semester. Oral Proficiency Requirement \u2014Boston All students who enter the Univers ity in any bachelor of science or first professional degree program must, as a requirement for graduation, demonstrate oral proficiency by passing an examination designed and evaluated by faculty. The oral proficiency exam (OPE) is administered prior to th e student's first semester at the University. Students whose oral exam results do not meet University standards must take LIB 253 (Oral Communication in Health care) within the first year of matriculation. This course carries liberal arts or general elective credit (but not humanities credit). Students who fail the OPE or who fail to take the OPE during their first semester at the University are automatically regi stered in LIB 253. OPE Exemption Students are exempt from the OPE requirement only if they are matriculated in a program that requires a baccalaureate degree as a condition of admission, or if they are in a certificate program. Writing Proficiency Requirement \u2014Boston Students who enter the University without credit for LIB 111 (primarily first -year students) will be placed in a skills -building course, LIB 110 (Introduction to Academic Reading and Writing) or in LIB 111 (Expository Writing I). To meet the writing proficiency (WP) requirement, these students must complete either the LIB 110, LIB 111, LIB 112 sequence or the LIB 111, LIB 112 sequence, and they must continue to meet WP standards as these are monitored across the curriculum. Students place d in LIB 110 will earn general elective credit. All students who have entered the University in any bachelor of science or first professional degree program and have credit for LIB 111 and LIB 112 (primarily transfer students) must meet WP standards as these are monitored across the curriculum. To ensure all students achieve and maintain WP, the School of Arts and Sciences has developed guidelines for writing - intensive (WI) courses and a system for WP referrals. In addition, faculty are encouraged to incorporate writing emphases in their classes wherever possible. In the School of Arts and Sciences, LIB 110, LIB 111, LIB 112, and all HUM courses are designated as WI. Faculty in other disciplines may offer WI courses if they meet the following criteria: The amount of required writing should be significant, approximately 3,750 -5,000 words (15 -20 pages) of graded writing. The total words/pages should be divided a mong two or more assignments, and at least one assignment should include a draft that students revise with instructor feedback. A single term paper / project is an option, but the project should include several smaller assignments (e.g., a project proposal , followed by a literature review or annotated bibliography, a completed draft, and a revised final project). Faculty should devote class time to instruction on writing practices in their disciplines (e.g., abstracts, writing style, citation conventions, and formats) and on strategies for successful completion of assig nments ; they should provide detailed writing assignment instructions and evaluation criteria. Faculty teaching WI courses should set aside a portion of the course grade (minimum of 40 %) to be based on writing assignments (this is not grading for writing skills per se but for writing assignments that include demonstration of content learning). WI courses should have enrollments capped at 30 or fewer students. WI course faculty across the curriculum should employ shared proficiency and grading rubrics when assessing students' WP or evaluating writing assignments. To continually reinforce WP standards, faculty across the curriculum use a shared WP rubric to identify students who 111 October 26, 2016 appear to need additional skills development to meet WP standards. These students are referred to the University Writing Center, where the staff makes proficiency determinations. Based on individual situations, students may be assigned to writing tutors or workshops to address specific writing problems. Failure to complete an assigned workshop or activity could result in a grading penalty or an incomplete grade in the referring course (based on syllabus requirements). The intent of the WP referral system is to integrate writing expectations, instruction, and development in disciplinary/professional contexts that build on foundations established in the general education curriculum. Information Literacy Requirements (Library Modules) As a requirement for graduati on, students must demonstrate basic proficiency in the use of information resources by passing a series of instructional modules. The three library modules (INF 101, 102, and 103) are designed and evaluated by library faculty. INF 101, 102, and 103 must be completed in the student's first semester at MCPHS; most students will complete these modules as part of the Introduction to the Major course . Students who do not take Introduction to the Major will complete these modules independently. These requirements must be met before a student can register for courses beyond the student's first two semesters at MCPHS. Librarians at each campus or the Library link on https:// my.mcphs.edu can help students determine specific program requirements. Exemptions from Gene ral Education Requirements \u2014Boston Students enrolled in a certificate program or in a degree program for which a baccalaureate degree is an admission requirement are exempted from the core curriculum, oral and writing proficiency, and library module require ments. Students in the 30 -month Physician Assistant Studies program (Boston) are an exception in that they are required to complete the library module requirement though they are exempt from the core curriculum and oral and writing proficiency requirements . Exemptions from General Education Requirements \u2014Worcester/Manchester Students enrolled in degree programs on the Worcester and Manchester campuses are exempt from general education requirements, provided they have completed a baccalaureate degree at an a ccredited institution of higher education in the United States. (Applicants must still fulfill all prerequisite courses required for admission to their degree program.) Medical Terminology Requirement Competency in medical terminology is required of students in certain degree programs. Students usually meet this competency within their programs. A medical terminology course taken off campus is not awarded general elective credit in any program. All Scho ol of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics students in accelerated baccalaureate programs are required to pass (with a grade of C or higher) RSC 110 Medical Terminology for the Radiologic Sciences prior to progressing into their first clinical internship cours e (NMT 330C or MRI 402 or RAD 201C or RTT 201C). Students who are unsuccessful in their first attempt to pass RSC 110 may be delayed in progression in their curriculum while repeating the course. Note that students are allowed only two attempts to successf ully complete a course. Failure to successfully achieve a grade of C or higher in the second attempt of RSC 110, therefore, will result in dismissal from the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics program. Medical terminology is a prerequisite for admission to all postbaccalaureate School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs, effective summer and fall 2010. Introduction to the Major All students entering the University as first -year students (including first year transfer students) must tak e a 1 -semester - hour Introduction to the Major during the fall semester. The seminar is designed to ease the transition from high school to college by orienting students to MCPHS resources, career opportunities, and the academic skills needed for classroom success. 112 October 26, 2016 Arts and Sciences Co re Curriculum All bachelor of science and first professional degree programs at MCPHS must incorporate the Arts and Sciences core curriculum through curriculum components that are equivalent to the following minimum standards. DISCIPLINE(S) MINIMUM STANDARD Science and mathematics (13 semester hours) Life sciences One course Chemistry * One course, with laboratory Mathematics, physics, and computer science One course Statistics One course Liberal arts (27 semester hours) Healthcare ethics One course Communication studies One course Composition (includes introduction to literature) Two courses Introduction to behavioral sciences One course Introduction to social sciences One course Liberal arts distribution Three cou rses; at least one course (elective or required) must be in each of the three distribution areas (humanities, social sciences, and behavioral sciences) * For those academic programs that do not require a chemistry laboratory as part of the degree requir ement, the laboratory requirement will be replaced with any life or physical science laboratory course. See specific program curricula. Core Curriculum Rationale Preamble: The Arts and Sciences Core Curriculum and General Education In addition to education in the various Arts and Sciences disciplines and preparatory work in areas prerequisite to the curricula of the professional programs, the Arts and Sciences core curriculum promotes an integrated education. Integration facilitates liberal learning in the professional curricula through emphasis on six general ability -based outcomes: critical thinking and decision making, social interaction and citizenship, self -awareness and social responsibility, lifelong learning, communication, an d value -based action. Allocation of space for distribution electives, along with the presence of required courses in interpersonal communication and healthcare ethics during the advanced and professional years, affirms the faculty's commitment to education of the whole person. Life Sciences The life sciences introduce students to fundamental biological principles that are necessary to their future studies as healthcare professionals. Courses such as Cell and Molecular Biology and Biology of Organisms establish the foundations for understandin g the cellular, biochemical, immunological, and microbial mechanisms that form the basis of more advanced studies, such as microbiology, physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmaceutical biotechnology. The life sciences component of the core curriculum is de signed to provide students with a breadth of basic knowledge and practice in applying that knowledge to solve complex problems. Emphasis on active learning strategies in both didactic and laboratory assignments prepares students for the independent and adv anced learning required by all degree programs at the University . Chemistry Chemistry introduces students to the composition, structure, and properties of substances and is fundamental to an understanding of the physical world. By gaining knowledge of the particulate nature of matter, students learn an explanatory paradigm that supports the biological and pharmaceutical sciences and illuminates the history of science and technology. Since the atomic world is not directly observable, the discipline of ch emistry cultivates formal reasoning skills, such as drawing inferences from observations. By approaching knowledge through a constructivist perspective, chemistry complements the liberal arts and develops an appreciation for open -minded and dynamic learnin g. Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science Mathematics is the basic language of the sciences. The process of learning mathematics helps develop logical and rational habits of reasoning and acclimates students to the operation of formal systems. Physics helps students implement active learning strategies in the analysis and solution of complex problems requiring the integration of symbolic, mathematical reasoning with verbal and visual thinking skills. Laboratories cast the student in the role of researc her and emphasize the importance of careful procedure and observation in the collection and analysis of experimental data. A sound understanding of calculus and the calculus -based concepts and principles of mechanics 113 October 26, 2016 provides a necessary foundation for adv anced study in chemistry and the biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences. Computers and communication technologies have become integral aspects of scientific learning and professional practice. Computer science courses provide knowledge of critical software applications, hardware components, and Internet resources. They foster the creative organization and presentation of information, enhance problem -solving and data management skills, and develop abilities to track and use new information pertinent to profe ssional learning and practice. Statistics Statistics is a core course because it provides the tools needed to accurately assess statistical analyses that are reported in both the mass media and scholarly publications. The ability to effectively interpret numerical and graphical statistics is necessary for advanced study in the health professions, and it is essential that healthcare professionals demonstrate knowledge of the statistical terminology and methodologies found in the biomedical and professional literature. The formal study of statistics complements the sciences because it also requires that students learn to formulate and test hypotheses and draw appropriate conclusions. Health care Ethics Ethics is a necessary component of any professional education. Healthcare ethics prepares students to identify the salient ethical issues that arise in contemporary healthcare practice (including biomedical and behavioral research). Formal instruction puts these contemporary issues in broader context by int roducing students to the historical quest for a coherent and comprehensive normative ethical theory to guide personal and professional conduct. It also reviews and evaluates the strengths and limitations of competing normative ethical theories and engages students in theoretical discussion and analysis of problematic case studies. This core component forms one of the crucial general ability -based outcomes in professional education: the responsible use of values and ethical principles. Communication Interpe rsonal communication is also a necessary core component in the education of health professionals. Communication studies provide a theoretical model for understanding the two -way nature of communication and the various factors that influence the transmissio n and exchange of information and the development of interpersonal relationships, including patient -provider relationships. Communication studies help students assess their communication competencies, improve their ability to work with colleagues, and adap t to new social environments. Students learn listening and public speaking skills, assertiveness strategies, and ways of demonstrating empathy. Enhanced self - awareness and self -esteem contribute to professional development and lifelong learning. Compositi on Expository writing develops the ability to write clearly, concisely, and precisely. The use of writing as a tool for learning increases academic performance across the curriculum and promotes student -centered learning. Writing from sources teaches summa ry, synthesis, and criticism skills that are basic to all disciplines. Expository writing also develops research skills, including the use of library and online resources, location and evaluation of source materials, thesis formulation and development, and referencing and citation techniques. Attention to works of prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and student -centered exploration of moods and meanings in expressive media provide the foundation for humanistic, literary, and aesthetic analysis. Introduction to the Behavioral Sciences A foundational course in the behavioral sciences teaches students how internal factors (e.g., personality and motives) and external factors (e.g., social pressures) combine to affect behavior. Students learn to appreciate the man ner in which human behavior can be studied systematically and scientifically. They also come to understand the differences between \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" behavior and how difficult it can be to distinguish these. Students learn that some of their assumpti ons about humans are misconceptions and stereotypes, and they learn to apply the concepts, theories, and principles of psychology and/or sociology to develop a better understanding of themselves and those around them. Introduction to the Social Sciences A foundational, interdisciplinary course in the social sciences teaches students the value of historical perspective as well as terms and concepts basic to disciplinary study in the social sciences (e.g., culture, class, ethnicity, race, gender, and social construction). Students survey historical patterns of immigration and social transformation, study themes related to the emergence of American culture and identity, and explore various forces and factors that contribute to the formation of both individual and collective identities. Students are introduced to the analysis and use of historical documents, secondary sources, and visual media. Students learn how to locate contemporary issues in historical, social, economic, and political frameworks; to identify individual, social, and cultural differences; and to express sensitivity and tolerance within a culturally diverse society. 114 October 26, 2016 Humanities Humanities distribution electives include courses in advanced foreign languages, aesthetics, literature, philosophy, an d religious studies. All humanities courses are writing intensive and build on prerequisite composition courses. They develop critical reading and reasoning skills and foster esthetic, moral, and humanistic inquiry. Essay assignments emphasize analytical, synthetic, interpretive, thematic, and/or argumentative writing. Minor Requirements For those students in Arts and Sciences, Health Sciences, or School of Pharmacy -Boston who desire further study in specialty areas, minor concentrations are available in American Studies, Biology, Business, Chemistry, Healthcare Humanities, Health Psychology, Nutrition, Performing Arts, Premedical Studies, Public Health, Women's Studies and Sustainability . Students complete at least three (3) courses that are only applied to one minor; these courses may not be used to fulfill requirements for the major or another minor. Requirements for completion of some minors vary for students in the Premedical and Health Studies degree program. These students declare minors by comple ting a Declaration of Minor form, and they must fulfill the minor requirements defined for their program. American Studies Coordinator : Dr. Jennifer Tebbe The American Studies minor is designed to offer students an opportunity to coordinate liberal arts electives in several disciplines \u2014behavioral sciences, literature, history, social and political sciences, and public health in the United States \u2014to form a co herent body of knowledge in the study of American culture.

In response to this phenomenon , the four-year Bachelor of Science in Health Psychology program was developed. The Health Psychology major allows students the flexibi lity to prepare for bachelor -level careers in patient care, healthcare research, management, or administration, or for further study in psychology, medicine, public health, or social work. In fact, with the growing emphasis medical school admission committ ees have placed on broad humanities undergraduate preparation in psychology and sociology, this program could serve as an ideal premedical track. One of only a few in the country, the MCPHS Health Psychology major produces graduates with a range of knowledge in psychology, a strong preparation in the basic sciences and liberal arts, and an informed sense of healthcare issues from other fields such as sociology, law, ethics, literature, history, and healthcare administration. Students receive training in research methods and statistics. In their senior year, Health Psychology majors apply their knowledge through individually tailored internships in a setting such as a stress reduction, pain management, or elder care center in order to apply their knowl edge and receive practical experience. To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative 2.0 grade point average (GPA) . To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Health Psychology degree, students must complete at least 62 sem ester hours at the University.

Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences Please note: The Health Sciences program is not intended for those interested in dentistry, medicine, occupational therapy, optometry, osteopathy, physical therapy, physician assistant studies, or veterinary careers. Students interested in these disciplines are advise d to enroll in the MCPHS Bachelor of Science in Premedical and Health Studies program, which is designed to prepare individuals for entry into these disciplines. However, students who choose to complete the degree requirements for the B.S. in Health Scienc es may, with mentoring, advising, and required academic performance, qualify for admission into these postbaccalaureate programs. 133 October 26, 2016 The Health Sciences program is designed for first -year and transfer campus -based students who are interested in healthcare business, health promotion, or health information syste ms careers. The program is also designed for students who are undecided about their preferred health sciences career pathway. Students benefit from opportunities to build strong academic skills while g aining more detailed understanding of available programs and program -related career prospects. Program Details Nonclinical career pathway: Nonclinical positions in the healthcare industry do not provide direct patient care. These positions take on behind -the-scenes or administrative tasks that help with the successful functioning of the healthcare facility. Because people in these positions do not provide patient care, they are considered nonclinical. Even though these positions have very different responsibilities than clinical positions, they are still a vital part of the operation of a healthcare facility. Examples of nonclinical positions in the healthcare industry include the following : Electronic medical records and health information systems s pecialists Health educators and health promotion coordinators Hospital, ambulatory care, long -term care, or public health business staff and managers Hospital unit coordinators and managers Human resource / recruit ing professionals Medical billers and patient accounts representatives Medical receptionists and customer care representatives Public relations, health communications, and healthcare marketing associates Students with a BS in Health Sciences may seek employment in nonclinical health sciences careers. By the third year, students choose a concentration in Health care Business, Health Education, or Health Information Systems. Clinical career transfer pathway: Students may be admitted to the Health Sciences program for one year to work with mentors and advisors and explore health career options. Students benefit from opportunities to build strong academic skills while gaining more detailed understanding of avail able programs and program -related career prospects. In the spring semester of the first year, students may apply for transfer into one of several MCPHS University health professions programs, such as Dental Hygiene, Nursin g, or Medical Ima ging and Therapeu tics. Postgraduate career pathway: By the third year, Health Sciences students may choose the postgraduate career pathway concentrat ion with the intent of fulfilling prerequisite and admission requirements for a graduate program in the health sciences. With mentoring, advising, and required academic performance, these students may customize their third- and fourth -year course selections in their chosen postgraduate career pathway.

Bachelor of Science in Public Health The BS in Public Health degree program is an applied liberal arts curriculum that prepares students for postgraduate master's (MPH) and doctoral (PhD) programs in public health. Students who continue their education in public health at the graduate level t ypically pursue careers in epidemiology, biostatistics, health promotion, community health, environmental health, biomedical science, or health policy and management. The curriculum prepares students equally well for advanced studies leading to careers in environmental science, public policy, health promotion, healthcare administration, law, and medicine. The Public Health curriculum builds on general education courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and liberal arts as 146 October 26, 2016 well as required foundational c ourses in social and behavioral sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, and public policy. In the third and fourth years, students continue with advanced -level courses; select four public health electives from the biology, behavioral s ciences, and social sciences disciplines; engage in experiential and service learning through a field placement; and design an interdisciplinary project in a senior capstone seminar. Public Health majors have elective openings that permit completion of a minor in Premedical and Health Studies, Biology, Chemistry, Healthcare Humanities, or Health Psychology, and they have opportunities for language and international studies through the Colleges of the Fenway, as well as travel courses and study abroad through MCPHS University . An additional option also exists whereby students may adopt a Pre -Health Law concentration. This concentration combines public health with the study of law and will prepare students to sit for the LSAT examination in preparation for law school to obtain the Master of Laws (L.L.M.) or Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees. To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative 2.0 grade point average (GPA ). To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Public Health, students must complete at least 62 semester hours at the University.

Please visit the website for more information (www.mcphs.edu) . Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene In July 2002, the Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene (FSDH) became part of MCPHS University. The school was first established in 1916 by the Forsyth brothers and the Forsyth Institute as the second dental hygiene program opened in the United States, and today it is the oldest continuously operating dental hygiene program in the country. Students who attend the school, located on the MCPHS Boston or Worcester campus, receive clinical instruction in the state -of-the-art dental hygiene clinics to enhance delivery of high -quality oral healthcare services to the public. The FSDH is committed to providing ex cellence through engagement of students in a diverse learning environment, fostering community partnerships, and advancing knowledge through scholarship and lifelong learning. Forsyth's degree programs prepare students to be leaders in their professions wi th career options in dental hygiene education, business, research, public health, administration, and clinical practice. The school embraces a strong sense of responsibility to patients, the community, and the dental hygiene profession as well as to high s tandards of healthcare ethics. MCPHS offers dental hygiene students the opportunity to learn in the Dr. Esther M. Wilkins Forsyth Dental Hygiene Clinic in Boston and the Esther M. Wilkins Forsyth Dental Hygiene Clinic in Worcester. The Boston facility is equipped with 24 operatories and the Worcester facility has 12 operatories with digital radiologic imaging technology, intraoral cameras, ergonomic patient and operator chairs, digital panoramic technology, electronic records, and a dental materials laboratory with magnification and flat -screen monitors. The FSDH offers an accelerated BS in Dental Hygiene, a BS in PreDental Dental Hygiene, Fast Track BS in Dental Hygiene, a BS Completion in Dental Hygiene, an MS in De ntal Hygiene, a bridge program to an MS degree for associate degree -holding dental hygienists, and a Certificate in Oral Health Professions Education for individuals with an earned 162 October 26, 2016 baccalaureate degree and work experience in a dental or dental hygiene sett ing. Each program has unique outcome objectives designed to fulfill the professional objectives or degree requirements associated with the individual academic needs of dental hygiene students. See MCPHS Online for a description of the BS in Health Science s Degree Completion program with a concentration in Oral Health. Clinical Component The clinical component of the program is supported by evidence -based information delivered in active learning and seminars. The student learns to assess risk for oral diseases and provide preventive services. In addition, considerable time is spent develop ing proficiency in dental hygiene procedures for patients of all ages, with a focus on building skills that support specialized care for unique populations. Dental radiology is delivered throughout the clinical portion of the program. The student develops skills necessary for exposing, processing, and interpreting both traditional and digital radiographs. Each student also participates in community -based clinical rotations that enhance on -campus learning experiences. Transportation is not provided to these locations; however, public transportation is available to most extramural sites. As a requirement for graduation and licensure examinations, the student must demonstrate competence by achieving a specified level of performance for each clinical skill and b y completing specific patient and service assignments. The student is ultimately responsible for obtaining the patients needed to fulfill these requirements. The student must fulfill all course requirements and competencies each semester to advance within the program. Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene Policies and Professional Requirements Basic Cardiac Life Support Each student must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support for Health care Providers by the American Heart Association prior to beginning the fall semester of the first clinical year. Certification must remain current throughout the program. Licensure The student who successfully completes the academic and clinical components of the accelerated BS in Dental Hygiene or Fast Track BS in Dental H ygiene program will be eligible to take licensure examinations. Successful completion of the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination and a state or regional clinical examination are necessary for licensure. MCPHS provides education to students in accorda nce with the regulations set forth by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Dentistry. MCPHS may not be able to provide the education and/or certification necessary for eligibility for licensure in every state jurisdiction. The student is responsible for determining eligibility requirements for dental hygiene licensure in the jurisdiction in which he or she plans to practice and to obtain any additional education necessary for licensure in that jurisdiction. Policy for Reentry and Content Validation a fter Non progression or Leave of Absence Students attempting to return from nonprogression in the professional curriculum or leave of absence must be cleared to return to classes by designated staff in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) and the Office of Student Affairs ( if a medical leave of absence). The Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) will notify the Dean of FSDH of the student's eligibility to return. Students who are not continuously enrolled in the sequence of undergraduate FSDH professional clinical courses for a period of two semesters or more must validate clinical knowledge and skills before they may reenroll in FSDH professional clinical courses. Validation testing will consist of competency testing to assess clinical and radiography skills related to direct patient care. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what competencies, content, and skills the student needs to review prior to testing , but it is the student's responsibility to prepare for the testing. Students must pass validation testing at a minimum competency level of 75% in order to be eligible to reenter the FSDH professional clinical curriculum. Students may also opt to retake DH Y 209L Pre -clinic and DHY230 Radiology instead of undergoing validation testing. A student who is unable to pass the validation testing at the 75% level will be given the option of retaking DHY 209L Pre - clinic and DHY 230 Radiology. If a passing grade is obtained through validation testing or successful completion of DHY 209L and DHY 230, the student may reenter the FSDH program on a space -available basis. If the student does not pass the validation test and does not reenroll or pass DHY 209L and DHY 230, he or she will be dismissed from the program. Reentry into the F SDH program is subject to clinical placement availability . (NOTE: There is no guarantee placement will be available at the student's desired time of return .) This policy applies to all under graduate dental hygiene programs . 163 October 26, 2016 Progression into Professional Phase of the BS in Dental Hygiene The minimum passing grade of C in Anatomy and Physiology (BIO 110 / BIO 210) and Chemistry (CHE 110 / CHE 210) and an overall cumulative grade point averag e (GPA) of 2.5 are required to progress into the fall of Year II (professional phase) of the program. Students who achieve the minimum passing grade of C in Anatomy and Physiology (both BIO 110 and BIO 210) but do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 at the end of the Year I summer term may enroll in DHY 202 Dental Anatomy and DHY 204 Head and Neck Anatomy in the Year II fall semester but may not enroll in other professional courses. If DHY 202 a nd 204 are completed with C or better grades and a minimum cumulative and professional GPA of 2.5 are attained, the student may progress into the remaining Year II fall semester professional courses the following fall semester. This will result in a change in the year of graduation . Students who do not meet the minimum grade and GPA expectations at the end of the first year or after attempting DHY 202 and DHY 204 will be dismissed from the program. Dismissal from Program Three grades below C in any comb ination of DHY courses results in dismissal from the program. Progression within the Professional Phase of the BS in Dental Hygiene To progress within the didactic and clinical phase of the BS in Dental Hygiene program , students must achieve a final grade of C or better ( > 75%). Obtaining a final grade below C in any professional course results in the student 's having to repeat the course. Progression through the program will be delayed ( i.e., the student will be on nonp rogression status ) because professional courses are offered only once per academic year. A dental hygiene student may be placed on nonprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the Forsyth Dental Hygiene program. A student who receives a seco nd nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the dental hygiene program. Bachelor of Science Program (Accelerated) The student who begins the accelerated Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene program is expected to complete the program in three years. To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Dental Hygiene degree, students must complete at least 60 semester hour s at the University .

These medical specialties use ionizing and nonionizing radiation in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Theoretical and technical advances within the field have allowed the development of new diagnostic modalities that enable physicians to examine vir tually any part of the human body. Advances in the field also have increased the effectiveness of the radiation therapy treatment of certain diseases, particularly cancers. The accelerated 32 - to 36 -month Bachelor of Science programs offer degrees in Diag nostic Medical Sonography (DMS), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nuclear Medicine Technology (NMT), Radiation Therapy (RT), and Ra diography (RAD). The DMS -- program is completed in 36 months, and the MRI, NMT, RT, and RAD programs in 32 months. The Bach elor of Science program integrates didactic instruction in the liberal arts, basic and applied science, and the social sciences with clinical instruction provided by the clinical affiliates. The location of the University in the Longwood Medical and Academ ic Area, as well as its affiliations with medical institutions located in the Greater Boston area, enable students to train in hospitals with state -of-the-art facilities that are among the best in the world. Students planning to major in one of the Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs will be expected to specify the program of choice during the formal application process to MCPHS. Students who are uncertain about their program of choice are encouraged to complete a shadowing activity for each specialty area in order to decide which discipline they wish to study. If the student has firmly decided on the concentration he or she wishes to pursue, the student should contact his or her local hospital to arrange a shadowing opportunity. If such arrangements c annot be made, the MCPHS director for that program will try to accommodate the request to establish a shadowing opportunity. All such requests will be processed on an individual basis based on available space and the specific shadowing requirements at affi liate institutions. Any request to change the major after matriculation to MCPHS will be based on availability of space in the new area of interest. Progression into the Professional Phase for School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics Majors and MCPHS In ternal Transfers All students must meet the following requirements in order to progress into the professional phase of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics majors.

Students also must earn a minimum grade of C in the professional courses in the major, including all clinical internships. Any student who fails a professional course twice is dismissed from the program. Students whose clinical performance during the internship rotation is unsatisfactory receive a warning from their clinical supervisor by the middle of the rotation; those who fail two internship rotations are dismissed from the program. In addition to being in good academic and financial standing , students must complete all professional coursework at MCPHS to receive their degrees in the Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Medicine Technology, Radiogra phy, or Radiation The rapy programs or the certificate in MRI or CT . BCLS Certification All students in School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs must have current certification in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) for Health care Professionals before they begin their clinical rotations (DMS 302C [General or RAD 201C). Eligibility for Certification \u2014ARRT Candidates for certification through the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) must successfully complete a program of forma l education that is accredited by a mechanism acceptable to the ARRT. Candidates also must comply with the rules of ethics contained in the ARRT Standards of Ethics. These include but are not limited to compliance with state and federal laws. A conviction of, plea of guilty to, or plea of nolo contendere to a crime that is either a felony or a crime of moral turpitude must be investigated by the ARRT in order to determine eligibility. Pregnancy Policy NOTE: This policy applies to all female students in the Radiography, Radiation Therapy, and Nuclear Medicine Technology majors or the Computed Tomography Certificate program . In the event a female student becomes pregnant, the student may choose to declare her pregnancy, since there is a potential risk to the developing fetus from radiation exposure. In the event a student chooses to declare her pregnancy, the student will notify the program director in writing that she is pregnant and also state the estimated date of conception. 194 October 26, 2016 The MCPHS Declaration of Pregn ancy for Radiation Workers form, available in the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics dean's office, shall be used for this purpose. A copy of this declaration will be forwarded to the Radiation Safety Officer. Choosing not to declare a pregnancy wi ll result in exemption from the specific state radiation protection regulations limiting the exposure to the embryo/fetus. Once the student declares herself to be pregnant, the Radiation Safety Officer will issue to the student a second badge to be worn during the gestation period at waist level to serve as a measure of embryo/fetus exposure. The radiation exposure control criterion for this student will be to limit exposures to this waist -level badge to less than 50 mrem/month (0.5 millisieverts). a copy of the applicable state regulations (105CMR120.203, 105CMR120.218, 105CMR120.267) that deal with exposure to the embryo/fetus a copy of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Guide 8.13, Instruction Concerning Prenatal Radiation Exposure , and Guide 8.29, Instruction Concerning Risks from Radiation Exposure . The student will be given an opportunity to discuss this material with the Radiation Safety Officer or his or her representative. In order to adhere to Commonwealth of Massachusetts Regulation 105CMR12 0.218, which requires that \"the dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, does not exceed 500 mrem (5 millisieverts),\" the student is offered the following options: 1. The student may co ntinue in the program so long as her embryo nic/fetal exposures are in conformance with the requirements of 105CMR120.218. If the student chooses this option, the following procedure must be followed: a. All efforts must be made by the student to ensure tha t the total exposure to the waist badge does not exceed 500 mrem (5 millisieverts) for the entire gestation period. b. The student and program director are to be notified, in writing, by the Radiation Safety Officer, if more than 80% of this dose (400 mrem ) is received. c. The student and program director are to be notified, in writing, by the Radiation Safety Officer if the monthly recommendation of 50 mrem is exceeded. d. The student is expected to utilize her knowledge of radiation control principles at all times to further minimize her exposure. e. If the maximum total exposure for the gestation period is reached, the student, Radiation Safety Officer , and program director must agree on an alternate option. 2. The student may request a leave of absence f rom the career component of the program. The student may continue with general education courses without modification or interruption. NOTE: Experience shows that the radiation workers in this program generally receive to the whole body well below 500 mre m per year, 50 mrem per month, and it is most unlikely that there will be any problems adhering to the fetal exposure limits. Policy for Content Validation after Non progression or Leave of Absence Students who have not been continuously attending courses for a period of one semester or more in an undergraduate School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics (SMIT) professional course, or who withdraw from a SMIT program via leave of absence, must validat e previous knowledge and skills held prior to program exit before they may reenroll in SMIT clinical professional courses. Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability .) This policy applies to all undergraduate SMIT programs. The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, such as meeting established program clinical competencies, in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. This requires that students notify the progr am director of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return in order to make arrangements for preparing and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills (competencies) need to be reviewed by students prior to the testing, but it is the student's responsi bility to prepare for the validation testing. Students attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by the designated staff member in t he Center for Academic Success and Enrichment and by the Dean of Studen ts or designee (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The designated staff member in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment will notify the Dean of SMIT when the student is eligible to take the validation test. Vali dation of knowledge will consist of a competency examination. A minimum grade of C on the competency examination is required. Program faculty will determine the content and skills to be included in the validation test. If a student fails the validation te st, he or she must enroll in a one -semester directed study course to remediate prior to reentering the program. This will delay the student's reentry for at least one semester but likely for one year (or more if 195 October 26, 2016 there is no clinical space available). The n umber of semester credits assigned to the directed st udy course will vary (1 - 3 semester credits) depending upon the number of semesters successfully completed in the program. If the student completed two or fewer semesters, 1 credit will be assigned; if three or four semesters, 2 credits; and if more than four semesters, 3 credits. Students may take general education courses concurrently with the directed stu dy but may not take any program professional courses until the directed stud y has been successfull y completed. If a student does not pass the directed stud y with a minimum of C on the first attempt, he or she will be dismissed from his or her respective program. 196 October 26, 2016 MCPHS University -Boston School of Nursing Paula James, DNP, RN, CCNS , Dean and Associat e Professor Assistant Professors Dean, Mombrun, Van Dyke, Whitfield Degree and Certificate Programs Bachelor of Science in Nursing Bachelor of Science in Nursing Accelerated 32 -Month Curriculum (Boston) Responding to the growing demand for nurses nationally, MCPHS offers an innovative accelerated 32 -month nursing professional program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree.

Successful completion of both the theory and the clinical laboratory / practicum in a clinical Nursing course is required to pass the course. A minimum professional grade point average (GPA) of 2.7 is required. Boston BSN students must achieve a minimum passing grade of 78 in each professional nursing (NUR) course and must achieve a minimal professional GPA of 2.5 in the first three sequential nursing courses (NUR 205, NUR 208 and NUR 215) in order to progress. A professional GPA of 2.7 is then required for all subsequent professional (NUR) nursing courses in order to progr ess in the nursing major and to fulfill University requirements for graduation. Students who do not achieve the required professional GPA needed to fulfill School of Nursing graduation requirements must complete a select remediation course(s) to reach the required professional GPA. A component of the remediation process is the requirement to achieve a minimum score of 850 on the HESI Exit examination. Official University graduation and approval to write for the NCLEX will not occur until professional GPA a nd HESI standards have been met. Any Nursing course that is graded below a C + may be repeated only once. A second grade below C + in the repeated course will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. Throughout the Nursing program, a student may repeat no more than two separate Nursing courses. Three grades below C + in any combination of Nursing courses also will result in dismi ssal from the Nursing program. All first -year (fall, spring, and summer) courses must be satisfactorily completed prior to enrolling in NUR 208 Essential Concepts of Nursing. All second -year (fall and spring) courses must be successfully completed prior to enrolling in NUR 325 Provider of Care I: Adult and Elder Health. Progression and Retention Policies Students must complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree within five years (32 -month track) . If this time limit from the da te of admission into the major has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Nursing, who may approve or deny the extension request. The School De an's decision is final and not subject to further appeal. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in NUR 325 Provider of Care I: Adult and Elder Health. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Healthcare Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Healthcare Provider Level card indicating active certification. (AHA requires recertification every two years.) It is reco mmended that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transportation Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical and field experiences is the responsibility of the student. A numbe r of clinical rota tions in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. The University will make every effor t to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances , students are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Licensure Students who successfully complete the program will be eligible to sit for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX -RN). Employment Due to the rigorous nature of the Nursing program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical schedule and course requirements. It is for this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging i n outside, non -program -related employment throughout the program of study. School of Nursing Professional and Technical Standards 199 October 26, 2016 A prelicensure candidate for the BSN degree must have abilities and skills in four areas: communication, observation, motor function and endurance, and behavioral maturity.

R eenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the student's desired return date. It may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availabil ity.) The valida tion will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills \u2014that is, meeting established program clinical competencies \u2014in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. The student must notify the program director of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return date to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills (competencies) the student need s to review prior to the testing, but it is student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. The student must pass the validation testing as per the outcome measures determined by the faculty. Failure to meet the required outcome(s) will result in dismissal from the Nursing program and/or the need to repeat identified courses. A student attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by designated 200 October 26, 2016 staff in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) or the Student Affairs office at their campus (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing.

This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. Students should expect to be assigned to clinical sites outside of Boston for at least a portion of their required clin ical rotations. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation, food, parking, housing, and other related incidentals for all clinical clerkships. In addition to the costs of the MPAS -Boston program delineated in the Tuition, Room and Boar d, Fees section of this catalog, PA students can expect to spend approximately $1,000 on medical equipment and approximately $1,500 for books during the program. Students in the MPAS program will need to complete a Criminal Offender Record Information (C ORI) check prior to starting clerkships. Positive CORI checks may impede or preclude a student's progression in the program and result in a student's being ineligible for placement at a clinical clerkship and for state licensure as a physician assistant. S tudents are responsible for the cost of CORI checks and for knowing the licensure requirments of the state(s) in which they intend to seek licensure . School of Physician Assistant Studies Policies and Professional Requirements Basic Life Support All students in the Physician Assistant program must present proof of Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers certification prior to entry into the second professional year. Students must maintain this certification throughout the remainder of the pr ogram. BLS for Healthcare Providers certification is required for Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) for Healthcare Providers training, and both active BLS Healthcare Provider and ACLS Healthcare Provider certifications are required for clinical c lerkships. Employment Outside of the University The PA curriculum is rigorous and requires many hours of study outside the classroom. Further, clinical rotations 204 October 26, 2016 sometimes require you to be present nights, weekends, and holidays. Therefore, outside employ ment while in PA school is strongly discouraged. Transfer of Credit The MCPHS PA Studies program does not accept transfer credit for any PAS courses during the 30 -month professional PA program. Advanced Placement The MCPHS PA Studies program does not aw ard advanced placement in its professional PA curriculum. Performance in the MPAS Program All PAS -designated courses (500 level and above) count toward the professional grade point average (GPA). The following are requirements for remaining in good academic standing: To progress within both the didactic and clinical phases of the program, students must achieve a final course grade of C (2.0) or better on a 4.0 scale. In all PAS -designated courses, obtaining a course grade below C results in the student's having to repeat the course. Progression through the program will be delayed because professional -phase courses are offered only once a year. This also would have a significant impact on GPA, which could jeopardize progression as well. A cumulativ e professional GPA of 2.85 on a 4.0 scale must be maintained throughout the entire length of the program. Should a student earn a course grade below a C, he/she will be required to repeat the course. Successful completion of the PA summative examination administered during the final professional year of the program is mandatory before graduation. Students with an inability to successfully pass the summative examination on the first administration will be allowed to retake the exam. The second attempt on the summative examination must occur between 14 and 28 days following the first administration. Failure to pass the summative examination on the second attempt will result in a recommendation for dismissal to the Academic Standing Committee. In order to r eceive the Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) degree, students must have earned a cumulative professional GPA of 2.85 or better on a 4.0 scale, successfully completed required courses and clerkships, demonstrated required proficiencies, and succe ssfully completed the summative examination administered during the final professional year of the program. Admission for MCPHS Students \u2014Undergraduate Curriculum For MCPHS undergraduate students seeking admission into the MPAS program (Boston), the prereq uisite requirements for application to the PA program may be met through matriculation in the BS in Premedical and Health Studies program. Students in that program must apply through the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) to MPAS during the fall semester of the third year of their undergraduate curriculum. The CASPA application deadline is November 1. All first -year and second -year BS in Premedical and Health Studies courses must be completed successfully prior to applying to the P A program. Outstanding third -year courses must be completed prior to admission into the MPAS program. Students in the BS in Premedical and Health Studies program who meet admission requirements (a minimum 3.0 overall GPA, a minimum 3.0 GPA in prerequisite courses, and C or better grades in all prerequisite courses) will be given the first interview dates. Successful interviews are required for admission into the MPAS program. 205 October 26, 2016 MCPHS University -Boston School of Pharmacy -Boston Paul DiFrancesco, EdD, Asso ciate Professor and Dean Executive Staff Maria Kostka -Rokosz, PharmD, Professor and Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs Stephen Kerr, PhD, Professor and Chair, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; Director BS Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences ; Interim Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies Bernard Tyrrell, MBA, Associate Professor and Associate Dean; Interim Director, Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy Program Gerard D'Souza, PhD, Associate Professor and Director of Assessment Michael Carvalho, PharmD , Professor and Chair, Department of Pharmacy Practice William McCloskey, PharmD, Professor and Vice Chair, Department of Pharmacy Practice Catherine Basile, PharmD, Assistant Professor and Assistant Dean of Pharmacy Experiential Education Department of Pharmaceutical Business and Administrative Sciences Bernard Tyrrell, MBA, Associate Dean and Chair Associate Professors Pharmaceut ical Sciences Stephen Kerr, PhD, Professor and Chair Professors Kerr, Maher, Mehanna, Montagne; Faculty Associate Bohlke ; Instructor Roberti Department of Pharmacy Practice Michael Carvalho, PharmD, Professor and Chair William McCloskey, PharmD, Professor and Vice Chair Professors Professors Baker, Basile, Crosby, Dinsmore, G rams, Morelli, Moukhachen, Murray, Nigro, tt, of Experiential Education Catherine Basile, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Assistant Dean of Pharmacy Experiential Education Andrew Szumita, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Director of Experiential Education Rita Morelli, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Coordinator Jennifer Fraser -Prisco , PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy P ractice and Experiential Education Coordinator 206 October 26, 2016 Degree, Certificate, and Residency Programs Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Honors Residencies in Pharmacy Practice Doctor of Pharmacy / Master of Public Health (PharmD/MPH) Postbaccalaureate Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Pathway (Online) Certificate in Advanced Pharmacy Practice Studies (CAPPS) BS in Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Business BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences / Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences BS in Pharmacology/Toxicology Doctor of Pharmacy The School of Pharmacy -Boston offers a six -year program leading to a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree.

Each graduate program deepens students' understanding in specialized fields of knowledge to prepare them for leadership roles in higher education, industry, government, and healthcare practice. Graduate education is highly individualized with respect t o both coursework and research requirements. MCPHS University requires specific courses relevant to the discipline that enable the student to develop the requisite conceptual and technical competencies needed to initiate meaningful research. Students also must develop the communication skills required to disseminate professional and scientific information. Finally, and most important, graduate students are expected to demonstrate an ever -increasing ability to independently identify and resolve significant p roblems in their areas of specialization. Participation in Research Research, the experimental portion of graduate education, is the major focus of the course of study in many graduate programs and prepares students for their future careers. The advanced degree is awarded after completion of the approved program, which in some programs, includes a written thesis or dissertation on the student's research. This research must be an original work of a quality that merits publication following critical peer rev iew. Experienced faculty mentors work closely with students to guide them in their research and other educational endeavors. Degree Requirements Master of Science The Master of Science (MS) degree is conferred upon graduate students who have mastered the advanced scientific knowledge and basic research methodology in their area of specialization and fulfilled the following basic requirements: 1. Successful completion of a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit at the graduate level, including 3 semeste r hours of research , a capstone course, or a case study thesis 2. Maintenance of a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for all coursework taken at the University. Transfer credit is not used in the calculation of the GPA. 3. Presentation of an acce ptable thesis or case study embodying the results of original research, which has been openly defended and approved by the student's Graduate Advisory Committee 4. Passing a general oral examination covering the major field and the thesis 5. Spending at le ast one continuous academic year in residence at the University conducting the student's thesis research. All graduate students involved in research continue to register for Graduate Study Extension (PSB 895) 226 October 26, 2016 until their research is completed and thesis de fended. (This requirement does not apply to the MS in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy or Masters in Clinical Research ) 6. Completion of all requirements for the MS degree within a period of four years NOTE: Additional requirements may be established by the individual graduate programs that are included in the program descriptions. The student's individual program of study is planned jointly with his or her Graduate Advisory Committee, which includes at least three graduate faculty members. Doctor of Philosophy The granting of the doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree is based on evidence of general proficiency and distinctive attainments in a specialized field, particularly on the demonstrated ability to conduct independent and original investigation. For the PhD degree, the student must complete the following basic requirements: 1. A minimum of 50 semester hours at the graduate level and 5 to 7 semester hours of doctoral research. A minimum of 8 semester hours within the minor also may be required. A stud ent who has earned an MS degree from another institution must complete a minimum of 40 semester hours in addition to the other requirements of the PhD program. 2. Maintenance of a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for all coursework taken at the University. Transfer credit is not used in the calculation of the GPA. 3. Successful completion of qualifying examinations in the major and minor disciplines (areas of concentration). The comprehensive qualifying examinations are determined and conducted twice per year. 4. Presentation of a dissertation that is a contribution to knowledge in the major discipline and that has been openly defended and approved by the student's Graduate Advisory Committee 5. Completion of at least one continuous academic year of residence at the University conducting dissertation research. All graduate students involved in research continue to register for Graduate Study Extension (PSB 895) until their research is completed and dissertation defended. 6. From the date of matric ulation into the PhD program, completion of all requirements for the PhD degree within six years following the BS degree or four years if the student transfers credits from an MS degree in the same area Additional requirements for students who pursue the PhD directly and bypass the MS , may be required to demonstrate a competency in an area related to the major or minor. Individual programs of study are jointly determined by the student and his or her Graduate Advisory Committee, and specify such requiremen ts. Graduate Advisory Committee The Graduate Advisory Committee shall consist of at least three graduate faculty members, two from the major discipline and one from a different discipline. The Graduate Advisory Committee is recommended by the graduate student and his/her gr aduate advisor with the approval of the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (GRADUATE COMMITTEE APPOINTMENT Form). While graduate faculty are the core of graduate research, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies can appoint other Unive rsity faculty or adjunct faculty with unique specialization to serve on Graduate Advisory Committees to provide enrichment to the dissertation research. The advisor is responsible for coordinating the activity of the Graduate Advisory Committee and ensurin g compliance with Graduate Studies regulations. The Graduate Advisory Committee should be appointed after a student has chosen his/her field of specialization (disciplin e), but no later than 12 months after the student matriculates. The student mu st meet at least once per semes ter with and provide written progress reports to his/her Graduate Advisory Committee from the time of appointment of the committee until completion of the requirements for the degree. The Associate Dean of Graduate Studies shall be n otified in writing of these meetings by the graduate advisor, as well as being provided with copies of the progress reports. More frequent meetings of the Graduate Advisory Committee and the student are encouraged in order to facilitate student -committee i nteraction. Meetings may be called at the discretion of the stude nt, the advisor, or if two or more members of the Graduate Advisory Committee request such a meeting. Academic advising Graduate Advisory Committee Graduate faculty have responsibility for ensuring that the standards of graduate academic performance are maintained; and to stimulate the development of creative inquiry, professional integrity, and intellectual honesty. Graduate faculty possess the appropriate terminal degree in their disci pline; are actively involved in research and scholarly or creative endeavors appropriate to their discipline; maintain their activities in their graduate discipline by consistently offering graduate coursework and the mentoring of graduate students in thei r thesis research. While graduate faculty are the core of graduate research, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies can appoint other University faculty or adjunct faculty with unique specialization to serve on Graduate Advisory Committees to provide enric hment to the thesis research. 227 October 26, 2016 Full-time MS Gradu ate Students The Graduate Advisory Committee consists of at least three graduate faculty members, two from the major discipline and one from a different discipline. The Graduate Advisory Committee is recomm ended by the graduate student and his/her graduate advisor with the approval of the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (GRADUATE COMMITTEE APPOINTMENT Form). The Graduate Advisory Committee should be appointed after a student has chosen his/her field of sp ecialization (discipline), but no later than 12 months after the student matriculates. In the interim, the student is advised by an interim graduate faculty advisor from the student's major discipline. The student must meet at least once per semester with his/her Graduate Advisory Committee from the time of appointment of the Graduate Advisory Committee until completion of the requirements for the MS degree. The Associate Dean of Graduate Studies is notified in writing of these meetings by the graduate adv isor. More frequent meetings of the Graduate Advisory Committee and the student are encouraged in order to facilitate student -committee interaction. Meetings may be called at the discretion of the student, the advisor, or if two or more members of the Grad uate Advisory Committee reque st such a meeting. Full-time PhD Students The Graduate Advisory Committee shall consist of at least three graduate faculty members, two from the major discipline and one from a different discipline. The Graduate Advisory Commi ttee is recommended by the graduate student and his/her research advisor with the approval of the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (GRADUATE COMMITTEE APPOINTMENT FORM). The advisor is responsible for coordinating the activity of the Graduate Advisory Committee and ensuring compliance with Graduate Studies regulations. The Graduate Advisory Committee should be appointed after a student has chosen his/her field of specialization (discipline), but no later than 12 months after the student matriculates. The student must meet at least once per semester with and provide written progress reports to his/her Graduate Advisory Committee from the time of appointment of the committee until completion of the requirements for the degree. The Associate Dean of Gradua te Studies shall be notified in writing of these meetings by the research advisor, as well as being provided with copies of the progress reports. More frequent meetings of the Graduate Advisory Committee and the student are encouraged in order to facilitat e student -committee interaction. Meetings may be called at the discretion of the student, the research advisor, or if two or more members of the Graduate Advisory Committee request such a meeting. Admission to Degree Candidacy Formal admission to candidacy occurs when the student with full graduate status actually becomes a candidate for the MS or PhD degree as regulated by the Graduate Council. Such admission requires approval of the student's Advisory Committee, through formal application (Petition to Graduate in Graduate Studies form) on or before the dates stipulated by the current University regulations on file with the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Admission to candidacy depends, among other requirements, upon the mai ntenance of an overall \"B\" average or higher, and all grades of \"I\" must be removed. The graduate student seeking candidacy for the doctoral degree may do so following the successful completion of the qualifying examinations. The degree re quirements for th e PhD degree should be satisfied within two years of satisfactorily completing the qualifying examination and within maxi mum time limits (see Time for Completion of Degrees). Change of Program Graduate students should work carefully with their major professors and advisory committees in designing their degree programs. If a change in the degree program is deemed appropriate, it must be approved by the major advisor , the Graduate Advisory Committ ee, and the Graduate Council, with recommendation to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. A change of Program form must be completed. Students are not generally allowed to change programs until completion of at least one academic year (two semesters). Dismissal Dismissal Policy A graduate student may be dismissed from the Division of Graduate Studies upon recommendation of the student's interim graduate advisor or the student's Graduate Advisory Committee according to the following criteria: The stude nt fails to meet the continuation standards of the Division of Graduate Studies, or Two-thirds of the student's Graduate Advisory Committee formally vote that the student is not making satisfactory progress in the program. 228 October 26, 2016 The Dean of Students may recomme nd dismissal for other situations listed in the Student Handbook . A student whose conduct (see Student Code of Conduct in Student Handbook ) is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the University at any time. In such a case, tuition fees paid for the curr ent academic term will not be refunded. In all cases, the dismissed student will receive written notice of dismissal from the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. The notice will include procedures for appeal, and notice of loss of housing, financial aid, and registration. Written notices will also outline any conditions the student should meet in an effort to gain readmission (e.g., taking a specific course and achieving a specific grade). Appeal of the Dismissal from the Division of Graduate Studies The student may appeal in writing to the Graduate Council by December 31 for spring re -admission and by June 1 for fall re -admission. The Graduate Council will revi ew the appeal. This review should include copies of prior documents of the appeals process. Graduate Council may interview the student and the student's advisory committee or the student's interim advisor, to secure whatever information is deemed necessary to assist in the decision -making process. The Council's decision is to be prepared in writing, and with all other documentation, kept in the student's file. If the student is not satisfied with the decision of Graduate Council, the appeal may be taken to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, whose decision may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Repeating Courses The Advisory Committee may permit a student to repeat a course under certain circumstances as long as the GPA of student is not less than 3. Credit hours from courses that were repeated are granted only once. A student is not allowed to attempt a course more than twice. Simultaneous Enrollment in another Degree Program Any student currently enrolled in the master's or do ctoral degree in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Business and Administrative Sciences programs at MCPHS may not enroll simultaneously in another undergraduate or graduate degree program at MCPHS or another University or university unless permit ted by the Graduate Council. Student Participation in Proprietary Research When the Faculty of the University are involved in research, some of which may be of a proprietary nature, particular care must be taken to ensure that the need for graduate students to publicly present and publicly defend the results of their thesis or dissertation research is not compromised. Graduate student advisors, and graduate students themselves, therefore, share in the responsibility to ensure that graduate students d o not become involved in thesis or dissertation research that is, or has the potential to become, proprietary if participation in that research delays completion of their degree requirements or negatively affects their productivity or future employability. The policy of the Division of Graduate Studies and the University is that a faculty member or a graduate student cannot enter into an agreement that prevents or significantly delays the presentation or publication of research results. Journal publication delays not exceeding a year are acceptable, but publication of PhD dissertation materials through ProQuest is a requirement of the Division of Graduate Studies and, thus, cannot be delayed. In instances where, despite good faith efforts on the part of the research advisor, and the graduate student, the graduate student's thesis or dissertation research is later found to be of a proprietary nature, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies will be notified immediately. The Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, i n turn, immediately convenes a meeting of the graduate student, the research advisor, and members of the student's thesis or dissertation committee. This group, in consultation with the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies resolves the problem. If the situat ion cannot be resolved through the efforts of this group, a ruling is made by the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Thesis A thesis contributing new knowledge is required on a topic in the major discipline. Prior to a student being certified as a candidate for the MS degree, s/he submits a research proposal on the proposed topic. MS in RAHP and MCR students seeking to enroll i n DRA 810 Case Study Thesis must submit a one-page proposal letter for approval by the program director or course faculty . The proposal must comply with the Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations and/or MCPHS University School of Pharmacy Division of Graduate Studies Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations as amended from time to time. This proposal should show evidence of creative integration of course material, superimposed on a sound understanding of t he pertinent literature. Upon approval of the research proposal by the research advisor, Graduate Advisory Committee, school dean or department chair, and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, the latter with regard to availability and utilization of res ources, the student is certified as a candidate for the MS degree. The Graduate Advisory Committee critically reviews the written proposal. The student should understand that the proposal is acceptable only if it is imaginative and provides a scientificall y rigorous test of a meaningful hypothesis. The proposal may be strengthened with data from preliminary 229 October 26, 2016 experiments. Within two weeks of the submission of the written proposal to the committee, the student presents and defends the research proposal orally before the committee. The student is questioned on those methodologies and background areas needed to complete successfully the proposed research. Such admission to candidacy must occur at least three months prior to completing requirements for the degree. The Division of Graduate Studies recognizes that the student's research may deviate substantially from that originally proposed. The student should be encouraged to pursue promising leads; however, long -term changes in the direction of the student's resea rch should be in consultation with the Graduate Advisory Committee. Off-campus research is not permitted, except for unusual circumstances that require a portion of the research to be completed off -campus in the continental United States. If such a situat ion arises, the research advisor with the written approval of the Graduate Advisory Committee submits to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Graduate Council a written request for permission to conduct the research off -campus. Along with the request is a letter from the off-campus researcher agreeing to serve as the off -campus mentor and a description of the resources the off -campus site provides. A visit to the off -campus site for the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (or his/her designee) and the research advisor is arranged once the research commences off -campus. Following approval of the Graduate Advisory Committee that the thesis is ready for defense, one copy of the final draft of the thesis must be available to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies not less than two weeks before a date is set for the student's final examination. After making final corrections, the original and one copy of the thesis, approved by the Graduate Advisory Committee and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, per r equirements of the Library, must be in the Graduate Office two weeks prior to graduation along with a RECEIPT OF THESIS/DISSERTATION Form. The thesis must comply with the regulations contained in Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Disserta tions which is Appendix I. Students are responsible for all costs related to preparation of the thesis. Final Examination Each candidate is required to pass a general oral examination covering the major field and the thesis/dissertation. This shall begi n with a formal presentation with appropriate slides and shall be at least 30 minutes in length for the MS candidate. The examination is conducted by the Graduate Advisory Committee, with his/her research advisor presiding as the chairperson. The Graduate Advisory Committee will have primary responsibility for evaluating the student's research, including the written thesis/dissertation, and the formal oral presentation which is open to the University community. Approval of the final examination by the Grad uate Advisory Committee, with no more than one dissenting vote, is necessary to recommend the awarding of the degree. The decision of the Graduate Advisory Committee is forwarded to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (THESIS/DISSERTATION DEFENSE Form). The graduate facul ty has the authority, which it has delegated to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, to approve the candidate for the awarding of the degree. Only one opportunity for re -examination shall be given (in not less than three months and n ot more than one year from the time of the final examination at which this decision was made). Any candidate who is granted the privilege of re - examination shall retain the status and obligations of a graduate student until the time of such re -examination. Programs of Study Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy (Boston and Online) The University offers a Master of Science degree in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy (MS in RAHP ),and two graduate certificate programs, one in Regulatory Affairs and the other in Health Policy. The MS in RAHP offers academic training in the law and regulation of healthcare, drugs, devices and biologics ; and health policy to candidates having attained a prior baccalaureate degree or equivalent pr ofessional degree. Candidates for this program are those interested in pursuing careers in regulatory affairs, project/product management, clinical development, marketing, quality assurance, quality control, and manufacturing, or with federal or state healthcare regulatory agencies, clinical research organizations, managed care, or other health -related fields where knowledge of the regulatory and legal environment is a prerequisite. In addition to the general MS degree requirements described in the MCPHS Un iversity course catalog, the program may establish additional requirements. Although the primary emphasis of this program is placed on regulatory affairs, other components such as ethics , policy development, policy analysis, and law are also explored. The program aims to educate a broad range or professionals who are interested in developing expertise in regulatory and policy education. 230 October 26, 2016 Program Objectives and Outcomes Upon successful completion of this program, a graduate with an MS in RAHP should be able to develop a strategy for a medical product that addresses regulatory, financial, clinical, and ethical requirements; evaluate and deconstruct regulatory and policy issues concerning pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biologics, or healthcare in an industry or government workplace; provide regulatory guidance and technical support (e.g., on FDA compliance) to members of the healthcare industry and/or regulatory agencies; assist pharmace utical companies in their efforts to gain FDA marketing approval of drugs, medical devices, and biologics by drawing on a comprehensive knowledge base of regulation and policy; assist regulatory agencies in developing, analyzing, and evaluating healthcare related policy and regulation; assist regulatory agencies in evaluating new or existing drugs and medical devices for marketing approval; develop, coordinate, and implement drug, device, or healthcare regulatory schema or policy initiatives; and demonstra te and incorporate a broad sensitivity to healthcare -related issues and their regulatory or policy implications.

The composition of molecules and their interactions in both a chemical and a physical sense are studied, with the aim of predicting the behavior and properties of new substances. A fundamental understanding of the properties of chemical substances finds application in most frontier areas of biologically related scientific research being conducted in industri al, government, and academic laboratories. Programs in chemistry lead to the MS and PhD degrees. Admission to the chemistry graduate programs requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology that includes two semesters each of general, organic, and analytical chemistry (one semester of which must include instrumental analysis ); physical chemistry ; calculus ; and physics. Students without these prerequisites may be required to complete American Chemical Society proficiency examinations in general, organic, and/or analytical chemistry during the first semester. Medicinal chemistry is concerned with the study of those structural, stereochemical, and physical parameters that affect the biological interaction of synthetic and naturally occurr ing drugs at the molecular level. Research is directed toward a fuller understanding of the pharmacological actions of such substances, leading to improved drug design. Specialization in these programs requires a broad knowledge of organic and heterocyclic chemistry, pharmacy, spectroscopic instrumentation, and pharmacology. Ongoing research programs include the synthesis and evaluation of antiviral and anticancer drugs, the synthesis of new laser dyes, and the isolation and characterization of natural prod ucts from plants.

The programs are designed to provide an appropriate balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of the area of specialization, which enables the student to be immediately productive yet prepared for future growth and development. Admission to the pharmaceutics graduate programs requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology that includes two semesters each of general, organic , and analytical chemistry (one semester of which must include instrumental analysis ); physical chemistry ; calculus ; and physics. Holders of undergraduate degrees in nonpharmacy areas are required to complete the following pharmacy courses for no credit: P hysical Pharmacy, Dosage Forms, Biopharmaceutics, and Pharmacokinetics. The student is exposed to a broad range of theory and concepts, intended to promote a firm understanding of the materials and technologies associated with pharmaceutical product devel opment, manufacture, and evaluation. The program encompasses the study of pharmaceutical dosage forms, the release of a drug from the dosage form, drug dissolution, drug absorption, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics involves the study of the rates of drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, and the quantitative relationship of these rates to drug therapy and/or toxicity. Research projects have typically involved development of new drug products, novel dosage forms, the release of a drug from new dosage forms, preformulation investigation of new drug entities, and pharmacokinetics.

Pharmacology Pharmacology is the medical science that involv es all facets of the action of drugs and environmental chemicals on biological systems and their constituent parts. This includes everything from the intermolecular reactions of chemical compounds within a cell to the evaluation of the effectiveness of a d rug in the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of human disease. Pharmacology offers unique opportunities to contribute to the knowledge, well -being, and survival of mankind. Admission to the pharmacology graduate program requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology. While formal training in pharmacology and human physiology at the undergraduate level is helpful, it is not required for admission. Students who are deficient in these areas are required to audit the undergraduate course sequences in pharmacology / medicinal chemistry and/or physiology. Programs leading to the degrees of MS and PhD are offered for graduate study in pharmacology. Each comprises two major components: (1) coursework in specific disciplines such as pharmacol ogy, physiology, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, and related disciplines, and (2) training in research and the scientific method. The programs prepare students for positions of leadership and responsibility in academic, industrial, and government settings. Theoretical and experiential situations in which pharmacological information may be applied are provided to help students develop an innovative and creative approach to problem solving.

Degree Program Doctor of Physical Therapy The entry -level Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program on the Worcester campus prepares graduates to develop the advanced knowledge and skills req uired for contemporary physical therapy practice. The curriculum includes the elements of foundational sciences, clinical sciences, evidence -based practice, professional roles and practice issues, healthcare systems, and management competencies in the educ ational preparation of physical therapists. The coursework is designed to reinforce and build on each element so that the student can synthesize and apply the learned material to a variety of clinical, research, and management situations. This postbaccala ureate program builds on the knowledge acquired from an undergraduate education and has two components: didactic and clinical. Through the didactic component, students acquire the knowledge and skills and develop the attitudes and professional behaviors ne eded for physical therapy practice. In the clinical education component, students apply their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and professional behaviors in clinical settings away from MCPHS. The clinical education component accounts for about one -third of th e curriculum. The curriculum for the entry -level DPT program has a total of 12 2 semester hours with approximately 36 weeks of clinical education. The program is made up of five concentration areas: Foundations of PT Practice (31 semester hours), Evidence in PT Practice (8 semester hours), Professional Issues in PT Practice (8 semester hours), Patient/Client management (39 semester hours), and Clinical Education (35 semester hours). Admission Prerequisites Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited postsecondary institution in the United States Minimum overall grade point average (GPA) and prerequisite GPA of 3.0 or better (on a 4.0 scale) Minimum grade of B - in all prerequisite courses Two letters of recommendation; one professional and one academic preferred R\u00e9sum\u00e9 GRE ( Graduate Record Examination) Personal statement (500 to 1,000 words) On-campus faculty interview (by invitation only) Minimum of 10 hours of physical therapy exposure/experience documented from the clinical setting, not time as a patient Official TOEFL (minimum of 213 computer -based or 79 iBT) or IELTS (minimum 6.5) scores for all applicants whose primary language is not English Official transcripts from international colleges or universities submitted to the Center for Educational Documentation (CED ), Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc.

Prerequisite Coursework General biology I and II with labs (8 semester hours) General chemistry I and II with labs (8 semester hours) Anatomy and physiology I and II with labs (8 semester hours) Physics I and II with labs (8 semester hours) Exercise physiology with lab (3 semester hours) Calculus preferred, precalculus accepted (3 semester hours) Statistics (3 semester hours) Introduction to psychology (3 semester hours) 250 October 26, 2016 Behavioral science elective (3 semester hours) All math and science prerequisites must have been completed within the last 10 years. Essential Functions The practice of physical therapy includes the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of people with physical disabilities, movement dysfunction, and pain. Physical therapists must be prepared to conduct in a timely manner a relevant patient examination, evaluate the results of this examination , and synthesize these data to establish an accurate diagnosis, prognos is, and plan of care ; implement an intervention ; and use the process of reexamination to assess patient outcomes. Physical therapists must also possess the skills necessary to determine when referral of the patient/client to another healthcare professional is appropriate. Physical therapists must provide evidence that the care that they provide is effective, often through the conduct of clinically based research. DPT students must be able to complete the following: Participation in all required aspects of classroom and laboratory activities Participation in all required aspects of clinical experience activities Effective communication with other students, instructors, assistive personnel, patients, family members, payors, and other healthcare profes sionals Maintenance of a safe environment for other individuals and for one's self, including use of universal precautions Provision of emergency patient care, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) Completion of elements of patient/client management, including examination, evaluation of data, formulation of physical therapy diagnosis and prognosis, intervention, assessment of outcomes, and record keeping Completion of specific patient/client interventions and treatments, i ncluding patient and family education, application of modalities, therapeutic exercise, and functional training Clinical agencies may have additional or agency -specific technical standards, which take precedence over MCPHS technical standards. The Commiss ion on Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) accredits professional physical therapy programs and requires that graduates of these programs be able to deliver entry -level clinical services. Graduates of entry -level programs are required to po ssess a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of physical therapy. Physical therapists require the intellectual -communication , behavioral -social, observational, and motor abilities to meet the standard of practice. Certain disabilities can interfere with a student's ability to complete the program of study and acquire the essential functions necessary for the practice of physical therapy. Reasonable accommodation can be made to compensate for some limitations. Howeve r, those that interfere with patient care or safety , or require the use of an intermediary may be incompatible with independent professional practice . Technical Standards Intellectual -Communication Abilities Intellectual skills include the ability to recall and comprehend large amounts of didactic information and to apply this information to the examination, evaluation , and management of routine and complex physical therapy problems . Effective communication skills enable the physical therapist to elici t appropriate information from patients and to effectively explain examination and treatment procedures. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include , but are not limited to , the ability to communicate clearly and in a timely mann er with patients, physicians, other health professionals, community or professional groups, and colleagues ; report clearly, legibly, and in a timely manner through progress notes in patient charts, reports to physicians, insurance forms, and order forms ; respond to such things as a patient calling from behind a curtain, warning calls from anyone, and machine alarms ; and participate in group meetings to deliver and receive information and to respond to questions from a variety of sources. Behavioral -Social Attributes Students must demonstrate the ability to practice in a professional and ethical manner and possess the emotional stability to practice in a stressful work environment. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal s kills, cultural competence , and motivation are all personal attributes associated with the practice of physical therapy. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include , but are not limited to , the ability to recognize and respond a ppropriately to individuals of all ages ; genders ; races ; and socioeconomic, religious, and 251 October 26, 2016 cultural backgrounds ; cope with the stress of heavy workloads, demanding patients, and life -threatening clinical situations ; and recognize and respond appropriately to potentially hazardous situations. Observational Skills Observation is one of the key tools that a physical therapist possesses. To gather data on patient/client condition and to appropriately manipulate machinery are critical to being an effective physical therapist. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include , but are not limited to , the ability to observe and interpret patient movement, skin condition, safety hazards, and changes in appearance ; and read and interpret equipment dials ; assessment graphs ; patient charts ; professional literature ; and notes from patients, physicians, and other health professionals. Motor Skills The practice of physical therapy requires that the practitioner possess the ability to perform basic evaluative and therapeutic procedures that require specific physical skills and stamina (e.g. , palpation, transfers, gait training). A therapist must be able to use vision and somatic sensation in the evaluation and treatment of patients. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include , but are not limited to , the ability to lift, carry, and push patients (150 pounds ) in bed s or wheelchairs, heavy equipment, body parts, and patients transferring from bed to chair or mat, or be able to instruct others in the activity , including proper body mechanics ; walk and balance well enough to help patients walk and transfer with or without equipment, and prevent injury to patient and self ; palpate anatomical structures and handle injured body parts without causing injury to the subject ; exhibit sufficient manual dexterity to manipulate very small equipment, provide support and resistance as needed through complex exercise movements, perform CPR, manipulate dials, and treat acutely ill patients without disturbing sensitive monitoring instruments and lines ; and provide for the patient's safety and well -being in all therapeutic or transporting activities. Professional Behaviors In addition to knowledge and skill acqu isition, the process of becoming a professional involves developing competence in professional behavior. Students are expected to display professional behavior at all times including during clinical education experiences. This includes displaying a profess ional demeanor in interactions and boundaries with patients and their families, clinical staff, peers, faculty , and the public at all times in consideration of their representation of the profession of physical therapy and MCPHS. The 10 requisite professio nal behaviors are defined below. Any student demonstrating unprofessional behavior will be referred to the PT Professional and Academic Review Committee. Definitions Critical thinking : The ability to question logically, identify, generate , and evaluate elements of logical argument; recognize and differentiate facts, appropriate or faulty inferences, and assumptions; and distinguish relevant from irrelevant information . The ability to appropriately utilize, analyze, and critically evaluate s cientific evidence to develop a logical argument, and to identify and determine the impact of bias on the decision -making process Communication : The ability to communicate effectively (i.e. , verbal, nonverbal, reading, writing, and listening) for varied audiences and purposes Problem solving : The ability to recognize and define problems, analyze data, develop and implement solutions, and evaluate outcomes Interpersonal skills: The ability to interact effectively with patients, families, colleagues, other healthcare professionals, and the community in a culturally aware manner Responsibility : The ability to be accountable for the outcomes of personal and professional actions and to follow throu gh on commitments that encompass the profession within the scope of work, community , and social responsibilities Professionalism : The ability to exhibit appropriate professional conduct and to represent the profession effectively while promoting the growth /development of the physical therapy profession Use of constructive feedback : The ability to seek out and identify quality sources of feedback, reflect on and integrate the feedback, and provide meaningful feedback to others Effective use of time and reso urces: The ability to manage time and resources effectively to obtain the maximum possible benefit Stress management : The ability to identify sources of stress and to develop and implement effective coping behaviors . This applies to interactions with self, patient s/clients and their families, and members of the healthcare team in work/life scenarios. 252 October 26, 2016 Commitment to learning : The ability to self -direct learning to include the identification of needs and sources of learning, and to continually seek and apply new knowledge, behaviors, and skills Adapted from L.B. Kontney, W. May, and.. Z.A. Iglarsh. \"Professional Behaviors for the 21st Century.\" Manuscript in progress, University of Wisconsin -Madison Physical Therapy Educational Program, 2010. Academic Standard s for DPT Program A minimum grade of B - is required for all physical therapy ( PTH-designated) courses in the DPT curriculum. Any courses designated as pass/fail must be passed in order to progress with the DPT curriculum . The minimum passing grade for all cumulative practical examinations is 80% , or B-. All DPT courses must be taken in the specified sequence of the curriculum. An individual PTH course may be repeated only once. A second failed attempt with a grade below the B - standard will res ult in dismissal from the DPT program. Throughout the DPT program, a student may repeat no more than two separate DPT courses. Failure of a third PTH course will result in dismissal from the DPT program. Progression and Retention Progression in the DPT program is dependent upon the student 's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA ) of 3.0 and a semester GPA of 3.0 as the student progresses. To progress within both the didactic and the clinical phase s of the program, students must a chieve a final course grade of B- or better, or a pass for a pass/fail course. In all PTH -designated courses, obtaining a course grade of less than a B- or a fail results in a student 's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program (i.e., results in nonprogression status) because DPT courses are offered only once a year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the s tudent's original cohort. A physical therapy student may be placed on nonprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the Physical Therapy DPT program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismi ssed from the Physical Therapy program. Students who fail a professional course are required to repeat the course prior to progressing in the curriculum. Students who fail a clinical education experience may be required to complete PTH 685 prior to comple ting the clinical education experience. Progression is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack o f clinical placement availability .) If a student is unable to progress in a professional course or clinical education after two attempts, the stu dent will be referred to the School of Health Sciences Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for d ismissal. Students must complete the requirements for the DPT degree within five years from initial matriculation. If this time limit in the DPT program has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extensio n in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Physical Therapy, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs / Provost. Policy for Reentry and Content Validation after Non progression or Leave of Absence Students who are not continuously enrolled in the sequence of the DPT curriculum for a period of one semester or more, or who withdraw from the DPT program via leave of absence, must validate previous knowledge and skills held prior to program exit before they may reenroll in Physical Therapy program DPT courses . Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee t hat space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability .) In order to ensure that all students are competent and safe in the delivery and application of patient care, any student who has not been continuously enrolled must, at the discretion of the faculty, demonstrate identified clinical competency. The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, that is, meeting est ablished program clinical competencies. The student must notify the Dean of Physical Therapy by March 1 for fall start, February 1 for May start, and October 1 for January start to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Stud ents attempting to return from a leave of absence must also be cleared to return to classes by designated staff in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment and the Dean of Students (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testin g. The Center for Academic Success and Enrichment will notify the Dean of the Physical Therapy Program when the student is eligible to take the validation test. Physical Therapy program faculty will provide guidance as to the content and skills (competenc ies) to be reviewed by the student prior to the testing. The validation testing consists of testing to assess knowledge and clinical skills taught 253 October 26, 2016 prior to the semester of anticipated reentry. It is the student 's responsibility to prepare for the validatio n testing. If a student fails the validation test, he or she must enroll in a directed study to remediate , followed by a second validation test, prior to reentering the program. Students must pass the validation testing with a minimum grade of B -, at the 8 0% level, in order to reenter the D PT curriculum. Failure to pass the second validation test after a directed study will result in dismissal from the Physical Therapy program. Taking the directed study course will delay the student 's reentry for at least one semester but likely for one year (or more if there is no clinical space available). The number of semester credits assigned to the directed study course will vary (1-3 semester credits) depending upon the number of semesters succ essfully completed in the program. If the student completed two or fewer semesters, 1 credit will be assigned; if three or four semesters, 2 credits; and if more than four semesters, 3 credits. Students may not take any program professional courses until t he directed study has been successfully completed .

A failed individual Nursing course may be repeated only once. A second grade less than C + in the repeated course will 267 October 26, 2016 result in dismissal from the Nursing program . Throughout the Nursing program, a student may repeat no more than two separate Nursing courses. Three grades below C + in any combination of Nursing courses also will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. Professional courses ( designated NUR) ma y not be taken pass/fail. Progression and Retention Policies Students must complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree within five years (32 -month track) or three years (16 -month track). If this time limit from the date of adm ission into the major has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Nursing, who may approve or deny the extension request. The School Dean's deci sion is final and not subject to further appeal. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in NUR 325 Provider of Care I: Adult and Elder Health. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Health care Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Health care Provider Level card indicating active certification (AHA requires recertification every two years). It is recommende d that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transportation Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical and field experiences is the responsibility of the student. A numbe r of clinical rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. The University will make every effort to a ccommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances, stud ents are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Licensure Students who successfully complete the program will be eligible to sit for the National Council of State Boards of Nursing Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NC LEX-RN). Employment Due to the rigorous and accelerated nature of the Nursing program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical rotation schedule and associated student requirements. It is for this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging in any outside, non -program -related employment throughout the program of study.

Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the student's desired return date. It may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement av ailability.) This policy applies to all undergraduate Nursing programs. The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, that is, meeting established program clinical competencies, in a selected clinical facility or simul ation laboratory. The student must notify the program director of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return date to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide gu idance as to what content and skills (competencies) need to be reviewed by the student prior to the testing, but it is the student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. The student must pass the validation testing as per the outcome measu res determined by the faculty. Failure to meet the required outcome(s) will result in dismissal from the Nursing program and/or the need to repeat identified courses. A student attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to re turn to classes by designated staff in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston , Worcester/Manchester) and/or the Student Affairs office at their campus (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The Center for Ac ademic Success and Enrichment, Student Affairs office and Nursing faculty will coordinate communication regarding student clearance for leave of absence return and subsequent eligibility to schedule validation testing.

Berman, MS, OD, Dean, School of Optometry Amy Falk, OD, Associate Dean for Academic Programs Greg Waldorf, OD Associate Dean for Clinical Programs Anne Reuter, OD, Director of Externships, Assistant Professor of Optometry Professor Berman ; Associate Professor s Frank, Shivanna; of Optometry (OD) The Doctor of Optometry (OD) program on the Worcester ca mpus offers a student -oriented, learner -centered program designed to provide a world -class education. The four -year program uses the latest in instructional and clinical technology to assure that its graduates possess the state -of-the-art education necessa ry to diagnose and manage the wide variety of ocular and systemic conditions encountered in today's diverse clinical settings. The program features clinically relevant instruction and patient care; dedicated faculty who place a high importance on teaching, advising, and individual student development; and clinical experiences in selected facilities in on -campus and off -campus optometric and ophthalmologic clinics as well as Veterans' Administration Centers, community health centers, hospitals, and community agencies in and beyond the Greater Worcester region. Technical Standards In order to fully describe elements required for successful completion of its professional optometric degree program, the MCPHS School of Optometry has adopted guidelines developed and adopted by the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO). All students are expected to demonstrate each of the competencies contained within these functional guidelines: Functional Guidelines for Didactic and Clinical Optometric Education at MCPHS University To provide guidance to those considering optometry a s a profession, the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO) has established functional guidelines for optometric education. The ability to meet these guidelines, along with other criteria established by individual optometric institutions, i s necessary for graduation from an optometric professional degree program. Our mission is to produce graduates fully qualified to provide quality comprehensive eye care services to the public. To fulfill this mission, each institution must ensure that stu dents demonstrate satisfactory knowledge and skill in the provision of optometric care. Admission committees therefore consider a candidate's capacity to function effectively in academic and clinical environments as well as a candidate's academic qualifica tions and personal attributes. The functional guidelines in optometric education require that the candidate/student possess appropriate abilities in the following areas: (1) observation; (2) communication; (3) sensory and motor coordination; (4) intellect ual-conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; and (5) behavioral and social attributes. Each of these areas is described in this document. In any case where a student's abilities in one of these areas are compromised, he or she must demonstrate alternative means and/or abilities to meet the functional requirements. It is expected that seeking and using such alternative means and/or abilities shall be the responsibility of the student. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, the school or college will be expected to provide reasonable assistance and accommodation to the student. Observation Abilities The student must be able to acquire a defined level of required knowledge as presented through lectures, laboratories, demonstrations, patient interaction, and self -study. Acquiring this body of information necessitates the functional use 273 October 26, 2016 of visual, audito ry, and somatic sensation enhanced by the functional use of other sensory modalities. Examples of these observational skills in which accurate information needs to be extracted in an efficient manner include the following: Visual abilities (as they relat e to such things as visual acuity, color vision, and binocularity): Visualizing and reading information from papers, films, slides, video, and computer displays Observing optical, anatomic, physiologic, and pharmacologic demonstrations and experiments Discriminating microscopic images of tissue and microorganisms Observing a patient and noting nonverbal signs Discriminating numbers, images, and patterns associated with diagnostic tests and instruments Visualizing specific ocular tissues in order to discern three -dimensional relationships, depth, and color changes Auditory abilities: Understanding verbal presentations in lecture, laboratory, and patient settings Recognizing and interpreting various sounds associated with laboratory experiments as wel l as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures Tactile abilities: Palpating the eye and related areas to determine the integrity of the underlying structures Palpating and feeling certain cardiovascular pulses Communication Abilities The student must be ab le to communicate effectively, efficiently, and sensitively with patients and their families, peers, staff, instructors, and other members of the healthcare team. The student must be able to demonstrate established communication skills using traditional an d alternative means. Examples of required communications skills include the following: Relating effectively and sensitively to patients, conveying compassion and empathy Perceiving verbal and nonverbal communication such as sadness, worry, agitation, and lack of comprehension from patients Eliciting information from patients and observing changes in mood and activity Communicating quickly, effectively, and efficiently in oral and written English with patients and other members of the healthcare team Reading and legibly recording observations, test results, and management plans accurately Completing assignments, patient records, and correspondence accurately and in a timely manner Sensory and Motor Coordination Abilities Students must possess the senso ry and motor skills necessary to perform an eye examination, including emergency care. In general, this requires sufficient exteroception sense (touch, pain, temperature), proprioceptive sense (position, pressure, movement, stereognosis, and vibration) and fine motor function (significant coordination and manual dexterity using arms, wrists, hands, and fingers). Examples of skills required include, but are not limited to, the following: Instillation of ocular pharmaceutical agents Insertion, removal, and manipulation of contact lenses Assessment of blood pressure and pulse Removal of foreign objects from the cornea Simultaneous manipulation of lenses, instruments, and therapeutic agents and devices Reasonable facility of movemen t Injections into the eye, lids, or limbs Intellectual -Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities Problem solving, a most critical skill, is essential for optometric students and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. In order to be an effective problem solver, the student must be able to accurately and efficiently utilize such abilities as measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, judgment, investigation, memory, numerical recognition, and synthesis. Examples of thes e abilities include being able to determine appropriate questions to be asked and clinical tests to be performed; identify and analyze significant findings from history, examination, and other test data; demonstrate good judgment and provide a reasonable assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients; 274 October 26, 2016 retain, recall, and obtain information in an efficient manner; and identify and communicate the limits of one's knowledge and skill. Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must possess the necess ary behavioral and social attributes for the study and practice of optometry. Examples of such attributes include the following: Satisfactory emotional health required for full utilization of one's intellectual ability High ethical standards and integrit y An empathy with patients and concern for their welfare Commitment to the optometric profession and its standards Effective interpersonal relationships with patients, peers, and instructors Professional demeanor Effective functioning under varying degrees of stress and workload Adaptability to changing environments and uncertainties Positive acceptance of suggestions and constructive criticism Candidates with questions or concerns about how their own conditions or disabilities might affect their ability to meet these functional guidelines are encouraged to meet with an admission counselor prior to submitting an application. Admission Prerequisites Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited postsecondary institution in the United States strongly recommended; a minimum of 90 semester hours or 135 quarter hours of college education must be completed prior to matriculation.

Beginning Spring 2016 the optometry program roll ed in a new curriculum. Courses listed for Years I, II, III and IV are accurate during this transitional year for the Classes of 20 20, 201 9, 201 8 and 201 7, respectively. The finalized, new curriculum can be found at the optometry program's website. Progress ion and Retention Progression in the OD program is dependent upon the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. To progress within both the didactic and the clinical phases of the program, students must achieve a final course grade of C or better, or a pass for a pass/fail course. In all OPT -designated courses, obtaining a course grade of less than a C or a fail results in a student's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program (i.e., results in nonprogression status) because OD courses are offered only once a year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the student's original cohort. An optometry student may be placed on nonprogression status onl y once during his or her tenure in the School of Optometry (OD) program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the optometry program. Directed study during the first three years may be requir ed as remediation in lieu of repeating one year (1) if the student fails one course that is not sequential and/or (2) at the recommendation of the instructor of record and the Academic Standing Committee. The final decision for approval of the directed stu dy requirement during the four -year program will be at the dean's discretion. Students in their fourth professional year who fail a clinical education experience may be required to complete a directed study course (ranging from 1 to 3 credit hours) prior to completing their clinical education experience. Progression is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry du e to lack of clinical placement availability.) If a student is unable to progress in a professional course or clinical education experience after two attempts, the student will be referred to the program's Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Students must complete the requirements for the Doctor of Optometry (OD) degree within five years from initial matriculation. If this time limit in the OD program has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the studen t must request an extension in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Optometry, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs / Provost. Clinical Rotations At a minimum, optometry clin ical rotations require background screenings. For additional information, please contact the MCPHS Chief Compliance Officer. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in OPT 650 Clinical Optometry. S tudents must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Healthcare Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Healthcare Provider Level card indicating active certification. It is recommend ed that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transportation/Housing Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical experiences is the responsibility of the student. A number of clini cal rotations in all years of the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical education sites. The University will make every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of 277 October 26, 2016 their required clinical rotations beginning in the first year. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel or housing expenses. Employment Due to the rigorous nature of the optometry program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical rotation schedule and associated student requirements. It is for this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging in any outside, non -program -related employment throughout the program of study. Doctor of Opt ometry / Master of Public Health Dual Degree (OD/MPH) This program option enables matriculated OD students to also earn a master of public health degree. Students will apply to the OD/MPH in the spring of their first year, and if accepted, begin MPH course s that summer. Optometrists with training and experience in public health can provide assessment of community needs for eye care services. They are able to assist in the definition of factors that contribute to the treatment and prevention of visual system anomalies, to develop and apply quality assurance systems, to participate and provide leadership in health -related agencies, and to foster public awareness of the need for eye care. An individual qualified both in optometry and public health is expected t o have the capability to develop, administer, and evaluate eye and vision health programs in research projects; design and conduct epidemiological field studies; use statistical methods in data analysis of case -control and cohort studies; develop and imple ment vision health education programs; and develop occupational health and eye safety programs. Students complete all credits for both degrees with one modification \u2014a total of 4 semester hours from the OD program also fulfill MPH requirements: OPT 691 (1 semester hour), OPT 695 (1 semester hour), and OPTC 874 (2 semester hours) fulfill the requirement for PBH 701 (3 semester hours) and PBH 890 (2 semester hours). A total of 210 semester hours are required for the dual degree. 278 October 26, 2016 MCPHS University -Worcester School of Physician Assistant Altongy -Magee , Nicole Dettmann, MSHS, MPH, PA -C, Associate Program Director / Director of Clinical Education, Assistant Professor Rosanne Washington, MPAS, PA -C, Assistant Program Director / Director of Didactic Education, Assistant Professor Dan Tzizik, MPAS, PA -C, Assistant Director of Clinical Education, Assistant Professor David Fredenburg, MD, MA, FAAP, Me dical Director, Associate Professor John (Jack) Kelly, MD, Medical Director , Clinical Assistant Professor Michael Whitehead, PA -C, DHSc, DFAAPA, Research Coordinator, Associate Professor Associate of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) The MCPHS University Physician Assistant (PA) Studies program is dedicated to the education of clinically competent medical professionals who are prepared to deliver quality patient care in a dynamic healthcare delivery system.

Certificate in Medication Safety (Online) The Certificate in Medication Safety program is available to all healthcare professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, and nurses who are interested in promoting a culture of safety. Several healthcare agencies such as the Joint Commission, Institut e for Safe Medication Practices, Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality are encouraging institutions to create a \"culture of safety.\" In fact, the Center for Medicare Services has established quality measuremen ts for several disease states. As a result, institutions have created positions and formed committees to better assess and improve healthcare quality and patient and medication safety. This certificate program prepares graduates to understand the fundament al concepts and tools that will guide them in developing various initiatives in medication safety at their practice settings. This includes creating a culture of safety, aligning medication safety plans with the goals of the organization, learning from def ects in medication -related processes, incorporating human and environmental factors to reduce medication error and adverse events, and effectively implementing change. Certificate courses also may be used to satisfy course requirements for the Master of Science in Medication Safety program.

Master of Patient Safety (Online) Patient safety and quality of care are in the minds of all health professionals as they journey toward excellence in healthcare delivery, promote a culture of safety, and ensure transparency of patient safety measures. Healthcare institutions are integrati ng a variety of methods to enhance patient safety, including enhanced communication and healthcare informatics strategies. The elimination of error and risk in the healthcare system can improve care and reduce costs. The Master of Patient Safety program has its foundation in the Institute of Medicine's core competencies for health professionals, which include providing patient -centered care within an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence - based practice, and incorporating quality improvement and inf ormatics. Building on these competencies, the program focuses on communication, medical error science, organizational change, and leadership. Graduates of the program will integrate these competencies to enhance patient safety within the healthcare organiz ation, enhance the culture of safety, and reduce both the risk and the frequency of medical error. Admission Requirements include a BS or higher in a healthcare or related field, a minimum of two years of relevant work experience, and a 2.8 or higher unde rgraduate grade point average (GPA). 291 October 26, 2016 The priority filing date for this program is June 1 each year for a fall semester start.

School of Nursing Academic Policies Academic Progression A minimum grade of C + (2.3 ) is required in all professional nursing courses. A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.7 is required. Successful completion of both the theory and the clinical laboratory/practicum in a clinical Nursing course is required to pass the course. Students who do not achieve the required professional GPA needed to fulfill School of Nursing graduation requirements must complete a select remediation course(s) to reach the required professional GPA. A component of the remediation process is the requirement to achieve a minimum score of 850 on the HESI Exit examination. Official University graduation and approval to write for the NCLEX will not occur until professional GPA and HESI standards have been met. A failed individual Nursing course may be repeated only once. A second grade below C + in the repeated course will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. Throughout the Nursing program, a student may repeat no more than two separate Nursing courses. Three grades below C + in any combination of Nursing courses also will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. Professional courses (NUR -designated ) may not be taken pass/fail. Progression and Retention Policies Students must complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree within five years (32 -month track) or three years (16 -month track). If this time limit from the date of admission into the major has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an ex tension in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Nursing, who may approve or deny the extension request. The School Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in NUR 325 Provider of Care I: Adult and Elder Health. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Health care Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the American Heart Association Health care Provider Level card indicating active certification (AHA requires recertification every two years). It is recommended that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transp ortation Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical and field experiences is the responsibility of the student. A numbe r of clinical rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. The University will make every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Licensure Students who successfully complete the program will be eligible to sit for the National Council of State Boards of Nursing Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX -RN). Employment Due to the rigorous and accelerated nature of the Nursing program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical rotation schedule and associated student requirements. It is for this reason that 294 October 26, 2016 students are strongly discouraged from engaging in any outside, non -program -related employment throughout the program of study.

The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, that is , meeting established program clinical competencies, in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. The student must notify the program director of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return date to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills (competencies) need to be r eviewed by the student prior to the testing, but it is the student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. The student must pass the validation testing as per the outcome measures determined by the faculty. Failure to 295 October 26, 2016 meet the required outc ome(s) will result in dismissal from the Nursing program and/or the need to repeat identified courses. A student attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by designated staff in the Center for Academic S uccess and Enrichment (Boston , Worcester/Manchester) and/or Student Affairs office at their campus (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, Student Affairs office and Nursing fa culty will coordinate communication regarding student clearance for leave of absence return and subsequent eligibility to schedule validation testing. 296 October 26, 2016 MCPHS University -Manchester Occupational Therapy Program Professor C. Douglas Simmons, P hD, OTR/L, FAOTA, Program Director Associate Professor Susan C. Merrill, PhD, OTR/L, FAOTA, Academic Fieldwork Coordinator Assistant Professor Peabody Degree Program Master of Science in Occupational Therapy The Master of Science Occupational Therapy Program (MSOT) on the MCPHS Manchester campus prepares graduates with the advanced knowledge and skills for contemporary occupational therapy practice. The curriculum includes foundational arts and sciences, basic tenets and theoretical perspectives of oc cupational therapy, clinical sciences, service delivery and management, professional responsibilities and ethics, and scholarship competencies in the educational preparation of occupational therapists. The coursework is designed to reinforce and build on required elements that allow students to acquire, synthesize, analyze and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of clinical, community -based, research and management environments. The MSOT program builds on the knowledge acquired from an undergraduate a rts or science education and has two components: didactic and fieldwork education. Through the didactic component, students gain knowledge and skills and develop professional behavior required for occupational therapy practice. Through fieldwork education students apply knowledge, skills, and professional behavior in clinical, school, and community -based settings both at MCPHS and off -campus. The fieldwork education accounts for about one half of the curriculum. The curriculum for the MSOT has a total o f 84 semester hours with approximately 30 weeks of fieldwork education. The program consist s of five areas of concentration: Basic Tenets of Occupational Therapy Theory and Practice (24 semester hours), Foundations of Occupational Practice (18 semester hou rs), Scholarship (12 semester hours), Management of Occupational Services (6 semester hours), and Fieldwork Education (24 semester hours). Admission Prerequisites Baccalaureate degree from an accredited postsecondary institution. Official transcripts from all colleges or universities attended. Minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale. Two letters of recommendation Resume Personal Essay (Why You Selected Occupational Therapy As Your Profession) Official TOEFL (minimum of 213 computer -based or 79 iBT) or ELTS (minimum 6.5) scores for all applicants whose primary language is not English Official transcripts for international colleges or universities must be submitted to the Center for Educational Documentation (CED), Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc. (ECE) or World Education Services (WES) for a course -by-course evaluation. MCPHS requires both the official international transcript(s) and an evaluated copy. Prerequisite Coursework Human Anatomy & Physiology with Lab (8 seme ster hours) Social Sciences (6 semester hours) Psychology (3 semester hours) Abnormal Psychology (3 semester hours) Child and Adolescent Development (3 semester hours) Adult Development (3 semester hours) Statistics (3 semester hours) Recommended (not req uired): Kinesiology or Exercise Physiology with Lab (3 -4 semester hours). 297 October 26, 2016 All prerequisite coursework must have been completed within the last 10 years and must be completed at the time of application. Essential Functions The practice of occupational the rapy includes the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of people with physical disabilities, movement dysfunction, pain, and mental health disorders. Occupational therapists must be prepared to conduct in a timely manner a relevant patient examination, e valuate the results of this examination and synthesize these data to establish an accurate occupational diagnosis, prognosis and plan of care, implement an intervention and use the process of re -examination to assess patient outcomes. Occupational therapi sts must also possess the skills necessary to determine when referral of the patient/client to another healthcare professional is appropriate. Occupational therapists must provide evidence that the care that they provide is effective, often through the co nduct of clinically based research. MSOT students must be able to complete the following: Participation in all required aspects of classroom and laboratory activities. Participation in all required aspects of both level one and level two fieldwork experience activities. Effective communications with other students, instructors, assistive personnel, patients/clients, family members, payors, and other health care professions. Maintenance of a safe environment for other individuals and for one's self, including use of universal precautions. Completion of elements of patient/client management, including examination, evaluation of data, formulation of occupational diagnosis and prognosis, intervention, assessment of outcomes, and record keeping. Completio n of specific patient/client interventions and treatments, including patient and family education, occupation -focused activities, application of modalities, therapeutic exercise, and functional skill training. Fieldwork agencies may have additional or age ncy-specific technical standards, which take precedence over MCPHS technical standards. The Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) accredits professional occupational therapy programs and requires that graduates of these programs be able to deliver entry -level generalist clinical services. Graduates of entry -level programs are required to possess a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of occupational therapy. Occupational therapists require the intellect ual-communication, behavioral -social, observational, and motor abilities to meet the standard of practice. Certain disabilities can interfere with a student's ability to complete the program of study and acquire the essential functions necessary for the pr actice of occupational therapy. Reasonable accommodation can be made to compensate for some limitations. However, those that interfere with patient/client care, safety or require the use of an intermediary may be incompatible with independent professional practice. Technical Standards Intellectual and Communication Skills Intellectual skills include the ability to recall and comprehend large amounts of didactic information and to apply this information to the examination, evaluation, and management of int ervention with patients/clients who have complex occupational performance problems. Effective communication skills enable the occupational therapist to elicit appropriate information from patients/clients and to effectively explain assessment and intervent ion processes and procedures. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to: Communicate clearly and in a timely manner with patients/clients, families and care providers, physicians and other health professionals, community and professional groups, and colleagues. Document clearly, and in a timely manner in patient/client records, reports to physicians, insurance reports, and order forms. Respond to emergency situations. Participate in group me etings to deliver and receive information and to respond to questions from a variety of sources. Behavioral and Social Attributes Students must demonstrate the ability to practice in a professional and ethical manner and possess the emotional maturity to practice in a stressful work environment. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, cultural competence, and motivation are all personal attributes associated with the practice of occupational therapy. Some of the skills an individu al must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: 298 October 26, 2016 1. Recognize and respond appropriately to individuals of all ages, genders, ethnicities, socio -economic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. 2. Cope with the stress of heavy workloads , demanding patients/clients, and life -threatening clinical situations. 3. Recognize and respond appropriately to potentially hazardous situations. Observational Skills Observation is integral to effective occupational therapy practice. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: 1. Observe and interpret patient/client participation in a wide variety of occupations applying a broad range of biopsychosocial knowledge and perspectives. 2. Read and interp ret patient/client records, specialized equipment, patient/client assessment data, professional literature, and notes from patients/clients, physicians, and other health professionals. Motor Skills The practice of occupational therapy requires that practi tioners possess the ability to perform evaluative and therapeutic procedures, requiring specific physical skills and stamina. An occupational therapist must be able to use vision and somatic sensation in the evaluation and treatment of patients/clients. So me of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: 1. Lift, carry, and push patients (150 lbs.) in bed or wheelchairs, heavy equipment, and patients/clients transferring from one surface to another using proper body mechanics. 2. Walk and balance well enough to help patients/clients walk and transfer with or without equipment, and prevent injury to patient/client and self. 3. Exhibit sufficient manual dexterity to manipulate small equipment, provide support and resistance as needed during the performance of complex occupations, perform CPR, and treat acutely ill patients without disturbing sensitive monitoring instruments and lines. 4. Provide for patient/client's safety and well -being in all intervention activities . Professional Behaviors In addition to knowledge and skill acquisition, the process of becoming a professional involves developing competence in professional behavior. Students are expected to display professional behavior at all times including during fieldwork experiences. Th is includes displaying a professional demeanor in interactions and boundaries with patients/clients and their families, clinical/school/healthcare staff, peers, faculty and the public at all times in consideration of their representation of the profession of occupational therapy and MCPHS University. Academic Standards, Progression and Retention All credits in the degree must be obtained in the MCPHS program. The Masters of Science in Occupational Therapy (MSOT) does not award credits for prior experiential learning and/or credits by examination. The academic progress of each student will be re viewed at the end of each academic semester. Progression in the MSOT program is dependent on the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a semester GPA of 3.0. To progress in the didactic phases of the program, stu dents must achieve a final course grade of B or better. To progress within the clinical phases of the program students must obtain a pass (P) score on Level I experiences and obtain a minimal score of 122 on the American Occupational Therapy Association F ieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapist for Level II Fieldwork experiences. In all MSOT courses, obtaining a course grade of B - or lower results in a student's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program . The student is placed into a non -progression status as MSOT courses are only offered only once per year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the student's original cohort. The student may only be place d into a non -progression status once; a student who received a second non -progression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the MSOT program. Students who receive a failing fieldwork grade on the American Occupational Therapy Association Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapists (below 122) or are requested to leave a fieldwork site prior to completion will need to arrange with the AFWC to complete another fieldwork rotation at another site. The timing of this clini cal rotation cannot be guaranteed to follow program sequence and may result in a later graduation date. Failure or dismissal from 2 fieldwork rotations will result in dismissal from the program. Level II fieldwork must be completed within 2 years of comp letion of all coursework that is prerequisite to fieldwork. 299 October 26, 2016 If a student is unable to progress in the didactic portion or the fieldwork portion of the program after two attempts, the student will be referred to the School of Health Sciences Academic Stand ing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. If this time limit in the MSOT program has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Program Director of Occupational Therapy, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs/Provost. If there is a disruption in the sequence of the MSOT curriculum by a student for a period of one semester or more, or a student has a leave of absence, the student must validate previous knowledge and skills from previous didactic and fieldwork experiences to ensure that she/he is competent and safe in the delivery and application of patient care. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that fieldwork space for Level I and Level II fieldwork experience and be maintained, it could take a year or more for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.)

The program is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC -PA) and graduates are eligible to sit for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE) required for licensure or registration. This program capitalizes on the extensive educational resources of the Universit y and the New England region to prepare physician assistants with the skills, competencies, and attitudes to provide compassionate, high -quality, and comprehensive care to patients of all ages in a variety of clinical settings. The emphasis is on community -oriented primary care, and students acquire experience in the evaluation and treatment of a broad spectrum of medical problems though the program 's clinical rotations . These experiential elements of the program provide training in emergency medicine, fami ly medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, surgery, and women 's health in addition to an elective specialty. Students applying to the program must submit a formal application and designate whether they are applying to the Manchester or Worces ter campus. Students cannot apply to both campuses. The application must include official transcripts and an essay through the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) and must be received by October 1 . CASAPA, the centralized national application service of the Association of the Physician Assistant Programs, may be contacted at www.caspaonline.org . About the Program In 2002, MCPHS acquired the Notre Dame College (New Hampshire) PA program that had been first accredited in 1998 and enr olled its first class in 1999. MCPHS -Manchester graduated its first class of Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) students in December 2002. While based on the Manchester campus, the program has a satellite on the MCPHS -Worcester campus with an ide ntical curriculum \u2014both delivered with faculty on each campus via use of synchronized distance education . For both campuses, the first year is dedicated to didactic and laboratory learning and the second to clinical experience in a variety of patient -care settings. Students attend classes at their respective campus, with didactic courses simultaneously de livered at both campuses using technologically sophisticated interactive 302 October 26, 2016 videoconferencing. This technology allows students at each site to interact with o ther students and faculty members in real time. Laboratory courses and small -group activities are facilitated by Physician Assistant Studies faculty located on each campus. Technical Standards for the Master of Physician Assistant Studies Observation Cand idates and students must have sufficient capacity to observe in the lecture hall, laboratory, and diagnostic and treatment areas of outpatient and inpatient settings. Sensory skills to perform the procedures of the healthcare profession in which students a re enrolled are required. In any case where a candidate's or a student's ability to observe or acquire information through sensory modalities is compromised, the candidate or student must demonstrate alternative means and/or abilities to acquire and demons trate the essential information conveyed in this fashion. Communication Candidates and students must be able to communicate effectively in both academic and healthcare settings.

All prerequisite 303 October 26, 2016 coursework must have been completed with a final grade of C or better. The number of times a course has been taken to achieve a passing grade will be considered. Prerequisite coursework taken at a four -year institution is preferred. If prerequisite coursework was completed more than 10 years prior, the candidate should submit a letter of request to the PA Program Admission Committee in care of the campus Admission Office. The formal letter must include when and where the course was taken, the grade received in the course, and the rationale for requesting the excep tion. A current r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and copies of transcripts supporting the applicant's argument must be included. While previous healthcare experience is not required, the majority of applicants have obtained a year or more of direct patient care experience. In addition, job shadowing of a practicing physician assistant for a minimum of 50 hours is strongly recommended. PA shadowing informati on should be included on the CASPA application under Related Health care Experience. This program is available only to applicants who have already earned a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution in any field, and who have fulfilled the prerequisite course requirements. Prerequisites include the following : An earned bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university with an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale A minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score for all candidates for whom English is not the primary language (see International Applicants in the Admission section for details ) Ability to fulfill the technical standards for admission, promotion, and graduation Other requirements for i nternational students as outlined in the Admission section Professional Responsibilities Physician Assistants (PAs) are skilled members of the healthcare team qualified by academic and clinical experience to provide a broad range of healthcare services under the supervision of a licensed physician. The healthcare services that PAs provide include performing appropriate medical interviews and physical exami nations , identifying healthcare problems in need of evaluation and management , screening results of laboratory diagnostic studies , implementing treatment plans , counseling patients regarding illness and health -risk behaviors , monitoring responses to physic ian- directed programs of therapy , and facilitating access to appropriate healthcare resources. These services may be provided to individuals of any age in those various settings considered part of the physician's practice. Professional Credentials Over t he past 30 years, several milestones within the profession have become markers by which the appropriately trained physician assistant is identified. These markers include graduation from an academic program accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, certification through examination by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA), and registration or licensure by state boards of medical examiners. Continued professional competence is evidenced by the completion of 100 hours of continuing medical education every two years and successful passage of a recertification examination as required by NCCPA.

It is during this phase of training that students apply and improve their clinical and patient management skills. There are 9 required clinical rotations. Each rotation is 5 weeks in d uration. In addition to clinical rotations, students participate in on -campus professional seminars during the clinical phase of training. Students are also engaged in writing a Capstone Research paper/poster during the clinical year. The program has clin ical affiliations with a variety of clinical sites in New England. Additional national and international clinical sites are also available. Learning experiences occur in ambulatory and hospital -based settings and include rural, suburban and urban clinical sites. Students are encouraged to choose rural health facilities for a portion of their clinical experience. The breadth of clinical settings offers the future Physician Assistant the ability to acquire skills and competencies practices in a variety of settings. Rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. Students are responsible fo r providing their own housing and transportation to and from the clinical sites and campus. Housing and travel costs for the clinical year vary widely depending on the site and location. Physician Assistant students are not responsible for identifying or a rranging their own clinical sites. However the possibility exists for students to coordinate, with the program, a maximum of two out -of-network clinical sites. To ensure quality educational training the sites must be approved by the Physician Assistant Stu dies Program and University and proper protocol must be followed to arrange for out - of-network clinical rotations. The School of Physician Assistant Studies reserves the right to make changes to all policies and procedures at any time. School of Physi cian Assistant Studies Policies and Professional Requirements (Manchester/Worcester) Students who are enrolled in the program must earn grades of C (2.0) or better in all courses and maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing in the program. Students are expected to understand and adhere to the codes and standards of the profession and to exhibit professional behavior. Students are required to be in good academic standing to enter th e clinical year. Students who receive below a C in a didactic course will be required to repeat the course before progressing to the next semester. This will result in a delay of one year to complete the program. Students must receive a 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to enter the clinical year. Such repetitions will lengthen the program beyond two years. Failure to achieve a cumulative 3.0 GPA at the end of the first semester of the didactic year results in being placed on probation. If the student does not d emonstrate improvement by the end of the second semester of the didactic year, the student may be dismissed. If the student does not achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.0 by the end of the didactic year, the student will be dismissed. 306 October 26, 2016 MCPHS University -Manchester School o f Pharmacy -Worcester/Manchester Anna Morin, PharmD, Professor and Dean of Pharmacy Paul Belliveau, PharmD, Professor, Assistant Dean, and Chair Jennifer Donovan, PharmD, Professor and Interim Associate Dean Paula Evans, PharmD, Assistant Professor and Director of Pharmacy Outreach Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Carolyn Friel, PhD, Professor and Chair Professors Acquaah -Mensah , Cohen (Emeritus), Gardner, Kearney, Friel; Sharma, Smith; Andey, Metcalf , Yan ; Associate Pollano Department of Pharmacy Practice Paul Belliveau, PharmD, Professor, Assistant Dean, and Chair Abir Kanaan, PharmD, Professor and Vice -Chair Professors Donovan, Lynch, Morin, Seed, Silva, Spooner, Steinberg , Sullivan ; Associate Professors Abel, Bartlett, Carey , Cooper, Cross, Dunican, Durand, Evans, Fong, Horton , PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Assista nt Dean of Pharmacy Experiential Education Catherine Simonian, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Director of Experiential Education Pharmacy Experiences Kara Bonaceto, PharmD, BCPS, Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Nicole Carace, PharmD, MS, Assistant of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Gretchen Jehle, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Degree Program Doctor of Pharmacy (Accelerated) MCPHS -Manchester offers an accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree in conjunction with the School of Pharmacy -Worcester/Manchester. The core pharmacy curriculum is identical to th at currently offered at the Worcester campus. Students attend classes in Manchester, while the instructors and other students are based in Worcester. Sophisticated technology and interactive videoconferencing are utilized to deliver the core courses and so me electives to the Manchester campus. Some electives, all labs, and some didactic courses are taught on site by Manchester -based faculty and qualified adjunct faculty, similar to those at the Worcester campus. Introductory and advanced clinical experience s are offered in a variety of approved settings (hospitals, clinics, community pharmacies, etc.) primarily in New England as well as outside the region, including other states and Canada, consistent with the assignments of students based in Worcester. This academically rigorous program is completed in two years and 10 months. Accepted applicants must have successfully completed all prerequisite courses prior to enrollment in the program.

MCPHS Online was formally created in January 2011 a nd grew from 5 online programs to more than 30 . Most of the se programs are fully online and affiliate with the various schools. S ome of the online programs have residency components which include orientation, clinical assessment, and/or capstone research experiences. In addition, the Center now owns several programs: BS in Biomedical Informatics, BS in Global Healthcare Management, Master of Healthcare Administration, and the Graduate Certificate in Heal thcare Management. Several other programs are unde r development or revision. All of the programs offered by the Center of Academic Innovation and Online Education are designed to give students opportunities to reach greater potential as healthcare professionals through online and/or campus -based learning in convenient and accessible formats. For the online programs , students are educated by the same faculty, are immersed in the same professional environment, and earn the same sought -after degrees as if they were on our physical campus. For thos e of you taking online programs and courses, these are some helpful tips (some can be helpful for campus - based offerings as well : Online courses require discipline \u2014typically, successful online students report spending more time, not less, on an online co urse. Do not make the mistake of thinking that online learning is easier than going to class \u2014it is not. Plan ahead. You need to understand all of the requirements for your online course, which are typically mapped out for each week, with assignments, rea dings, tests or quizzes, and writing tasks each week. Time management is one of the most important aspects of success in an online class. Create a schedule for your online course and keep it! Plan on spending 5 to 10 hours a week on a typical online cou rse. Good writing skills are very helpful in an online course.
