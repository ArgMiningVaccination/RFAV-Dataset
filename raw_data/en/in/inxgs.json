I would like to voice my concerns about the idea of requiring all students to provide proof of immunity to communicable diseases, including COVID-19. I will be focusing mainly on the COVID-19 vaccination in my statements. I would like to speak out on behalf of the individuals who may choose not to receive the vaccine for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. These persons should be exempted from any vaccination mandates that are put forward. Many individuals are concerned about the experimental status of the COVID-19 vaccination, as well as the data reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) that indicates side effects of the vaccine. If these individuals have hesitancy about taking the COVID-19 vaccine or any vaccine, they should not be forced to go against their personal convictions. Neither should these individuals be deprived of their ability to initiate or complete their educations within the Nevada System of Higher Education because of their beliefs or medical needs. A possible alternative to vaccinations for these individuals could be online classes. Because students in online classes will not be interacting face to face with faculty members and other students, they should not be required to take the vaccination. For students whose degrees require in-person classes, a possible alternative could be weekly COVID-19 testing provided by their college or simply wearing their masks on campus to prevent communication of the disease. When making a decision that will impact every NSHE student, I petition that this board consider the many diverse opinions and needs of those whom they seek to protect. A personal health decision should not have to interfere with anyone's education. At this crucial time, please do not let the voices of concerned students be drowned out. A \"one size fits all\" system will not fit all, for every individual is unique with their own needs and convictions. I trust that this board will make this decision with due consideration and care. Thank you. Respectfully yours, Sonora Woodrum "}
