Acupuncture adverse events include bleeding/bruising, needle site pain (1), aggravatio n of symptoms (2) and rarely more severe complication s such as local infections (3). It is important to reduce, as far as possible, the risks of these occu rring. There are no studies which compare skin preparation prior to acupuncture needle insertion with no skin preparation. The closest information available per tains to skin preparation prior to injections, such as insulin injections for diabetics and vaccinations. Research conducted as early as the 1960s by Dann ( 4) and Koivisto & Felig (5) with diabetic patients ind icated that although skin preparation with alcohol prior to injection markedly reduced skin bacterial counts, such treatment is not necessary to prevent infection at injection sites. Further studies have also suggested that there is no increased risk of infection if skin antisepsis is not undertaken for injection of insulin for diabetics. (6, 7, 8) There is similar evidence from reports of infection s following vaccination. The World Health Organization in 2003 reported after a review of the literature that if the skin is \"clean\" there shoul d be no need to swab an injection site no matter what bo dy area was being injected. (9) Similarly, UK Guidance on Best Practice in Vaccine Administration and the Position Statement on Injection Techniques published by the Royal College of Paedia trics and Child Health (March 2002) further reinforces these views by recommending that no form al skin cleaning is required. (10, 11) In the US, the CDC (2002) states that alcohol, soap and water or chemical agents are not needed for preparation o f the skin prior to vaccination, unless the skin is g rossly contaminated or dirty. (12) Other researchers have recommended the cleaning of the injection site in order to minimize the risk of infection. (13, 14, 15) Many practitioners believe it follows best practice guidelines to clean the s kin prior to injection to reduce the risk of contaminat ion from the patient's transient skin flora. The N IH, in its patient instructions is very clear that \"Since the skin is the body's first defense against infect ion, it must be cleansed thoroughly before a needle is inse rted.\" (15) The organisms most often responsible for causing sk in infections at medication injection sites are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes an d coryneform bacteria. (16) Occasionally various non-tuberculous mycobacteria may also infect the sk in. (16) Staphylococcus aureus is found on the ski n including the forehead and nostrils of both childre n and adults as resident flora. (17, 18) These sam e organisms are those most commonly associated with s kin infections related to acupuncture practices. (3 ) 2 Skin that is currently inflamed or which has an act ive lesion should not be used for needle insertion. These areas often carry higher risk for infection. According to NIH guidelines \"injections are not gi ven if the skin is burned, hardened, inflamed, swollen, or damaged...\" (15) There is one case report of a patient who reportedl y had septicemia after acupuncture during which the skin was not swabbed. The case report author, who was also the practitioner, admitted that the patien t's skin at the acupuncture point was not cleaned prior to the needle insertion and later found local musc le infection which led to septicemia. (19) Given the millions of acupuncture insertions that take place every year, a single incident of significant infect ion following an intramuscular acupuncture procedur e without skin preparation does not, in itself, help differentiate the claims about whether skin prepara tion is necessary. Medical experts, including the NIH, CDC and WHO, ag ree that the skin must be clean before any type of needle insertion is performed. (9, 12) Addition ally, all three categorically state that practition ers' hands must be washed prior to needle insertion. Th ere remains the question of how the patient's skin should be prepared prior to acupuncture needle inse rtion. Robust, scientific evidence to support the use of s oap and water for skin cleansing in general is limi ted; however, this has long been accepted as good practi ce. Specifically, the physical action of washing h as been long accepted for the mechanical removal of tr ansient flora which may contaminate the skin. (20, 21, 22) Xu, et al (2013) are very clear in their f indings that \"Clearly, guidelines such as Clean Nee dle Technique must be followed in order to minimize acu puncture AEs.\" (3) It has also been standard medical practice for some time to use 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs to cleanse skin prior to injection. (23) The most common proc edure for cleaning a patient's skin prior to needle insertion is the use of a 70% isopropyl alcohol swa b. The perceived advantages of cleaning the patien t's skin with an alcohol swab include a reduction in tr ansient skin bacterial counts and the fact that usi ng a swab is less time consuming than using soap and wat er in the clinical setting. The perceived disadvantages of cleaning the patient's skin with a n alcohol swab include the fact that alcohol is rendered inactive as a cleansing agent if skin is s oiled with organic matter (23) and the potential fo r pain if the skin is not allowed to dry prior to needle i nsertion. (24) Some practitioners allege that chlorhexidine produc ts be used as skin cleansing agents as they assert that chlorhexidine may work better than alcohol in reduc ing microbial load on the skin. However, there is little evidence to support this. A recent meta-ana lysis found that \"Perceived efficacy of chlorhexidi ne is often in fact based on evidence for the efficacy of the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination. The role o f alcohol has frequently been overlooked in evidence assessments.\" (25) The alcohol may play as great a role as the chlorhexidine in the reduction of micro flora. The CCAOM's Clean Needle Technique Manual (6 th edition) states that skin should be cleaned with alcohol prior to needle insertion. According to a July 2013 letter from the CDC (26) \"The procedures outlined in the CNT Manual are reasonable\" regardin g skin preparation. CONCLUSIONS: 3 The evidence suggests that both the practitioner's hands and the patient's skin at the acupuncture point need to be clean prior to administration of a needle, whether that needle is being inserted to an intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dept h. Risk assessment of potentially contaminated skin sh ould be conducted to ensure appropriate cleaning of the skin is undertaken where required. In other words, if the practitioner has reason to believe that the patient's skin is soiled, it sh ould be cleaned prior to needle insertion. There i s no clear evidence that skin cleansing with soap and water, alcohol swabs, or antibacterial substances like chlorhexidine is better or worse th an the other options. Even if skin is visibly clean, mild antisepsis may still be performed prior to needle insertion as all OPIM (other potentially infectious materials) a re not necessarily visible to the naked eye. If the insertion site is cleaned with an alcohol sw ab, it should be allowed to dry prior to needle insertion. The CCAOM supports the position that the skin shoul d be clean prior to acupuncture needle insertion, but that cleaning the skin with an antis eptic is not necessarily essential to prevent infections.
