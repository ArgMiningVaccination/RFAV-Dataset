Most importantly, please stay home if you have fever, chills, a sudden cough, or vomiting/diarrhea, or if you are caring for someone who is ill. You will not be charged a fee if you cancel due to illness, although we do ask you to give us as much warning as you can, since late cancellations/no shows prevent us from assigning appointments to others who need them. The main symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Please call your PCP if you are experiencing these symptoms. There are plenty of causes of non-contagious coughs. We see patients with asthma, allergies, COPD, for example, and we continue to welcome those patients to get treated. Out of an abundance of caution, we are asking those who are coughing/sneezing to wear a mask while in the clinic. Guidelines for coming in for acupuncture treatment: -Stay home if ill/think you may be getting ill, or caring for someone who is ill. -Use our hand sanitizer as soon as you enter the clinic. We are wiping down all surfaces including the yoga equipment, and door handles in the clinic and bathroom area. You're also welcome to use hand sanitizer before your treatment or yoga class. What we are doing at Sedona Sol: As always, we thoroughly sanitize our hands before and after every patient contact. On top of our regular cleaning procedures, we doing extra disinfecting of surfaces such as door handles, light switches, and yoga equipment. We will stay home if we are sick, even if it means closing. We are attentive to regular updates from public health, as this is a developing situation, and we may introduce new measures if necessary. There's no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted from soft surfaces like sheets, we are however frequently changing them out. Suggestions for staying healthy and preventing the spread of illness: Clean your hands often, especially after being in public places. Washing is best (20 seconds of soap, warm water and friction!) Alcohol-based sanitizer is good to keep on you and use often. Prioritize sleep, stay active, and eat well. Acupuncture is a great immune booster, too! If you cough or sneeze, do so into a tissue. Avoid contact with people who're sick, and stay home when you are sick.
