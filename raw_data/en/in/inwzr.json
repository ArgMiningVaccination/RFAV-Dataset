J Health Commun ; 27(4): 250-261, individuals' processing of conflicting [health]claims. Tests of the model, while highly supportive, have been experimental and have relied upon low-familiar topics. Accordingly, a [survey]of [parents]with a [child] [aged]<12 years (N = 510) was conducted to test the application of the CHIP model to the controversial issue of childhood COVID-19 [vaccination]; such a [vaccine]had not yet been approved for this [age group]at the [time]of the [survey]. As hypothesized, reliance upon conservative news was associated with the [perception]that media information contradicted official guidance to vaccinate [children], which led to issue [uncertainty]. Issue [uncertainty]prompted negative appraisals and [decision] [uncertainty]. Specifically, [decision] [uncertainty]partially mediated the effect of issue [uncertainty]on negative appraisals of [vaccination], which in turn aroused threat [emotions]. However, threat [emotions]did not predict information-seeking, as specified in the model. This result may have been due to [respondents]having already decided to vaccinate their [child], or not - a reflection of the partisan [nature]of the topic and the extensive coverage it had received. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Texto completo: Dispon\u00edvel "}
