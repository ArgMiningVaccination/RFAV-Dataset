By [Patricia Bonnard](/experts/starchaser-coaching) \u2014 Written on Mar 31, 2021 Photo: getty Many people undertake some form of detoxing and rejuvenation in the spring season. Increased exercise, exposure to fresh air and sunlight, lighter foods, fasting, and a trip to the spa are some of the more common ways people choose to detox, and they're all good practices. But, why not add aromatherapy and essential oils for detoxing and get a bigger, more enjoyable bang for your effort? They not only detox the body but also [tone the digestive and elimination systems](https://www.yourtango.com/2019321694/10-best-foods-upset-stomach) and [rejuvenate the skin](https://www.yourtango.com/2020339058/reasons-why-vitamin-c-skin-essential-how-use-it). First things first, what are some of the best essential oils for detoxing? Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) RELATED: [How To Balance The Root Chakra With Essential Oils](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/starchaser-coaching/how-balance-root-chakra-muladhara-essential-oils) Now that you know what essential oil to watch out for, there are some excellent ways to add aromatherapy to your detox program. Choosing the right application for an aromatherapy detox is important, as well. Here are 3 ways to use aromatherapy and essential oils for detoxing and rejuvenation. 1. Add essential oils to salts and scrubs. Salt and scrubs are wonderful for a stimulating detox. This abrasive action of salts and scrubs stimulates and exfoliates the skin and improves circulation in both the physical and energetic bodies. Scrubs and manual manipulation of muscles activate lymphatic flow and the elimination of toxins from the body. Natural sugar and salts such as Epsom, sea, and Dead Sea salts are more abrasive but can be finely ground and still offer beneficial stimulation. Salts contain minerals and Epsom salt is high in magnesium. Plant-based scrubs such as finely ground nuts or fruit kernels add a bit of natural abrasive action, as well as nourishment. Natural clays draw toxins from under the skin. Many clays also contain minerals that help rejuvenate the skin and nourish the body. Natural clays are a soft, soothing way to detox the skin. To enhance detoxification, add just a few drops (no more than 10 drops) of essential oils to one oz of salts, scrubs, or clays. Be sure to select essential oils that are appropriate for the application and use the right dilution. [Facial skin and aged skin](https://www.yourtango.com/2020333686/how-to-do-facial-home-three-diy-facials-you-can-make) are more sensitive and reactive than the skin of the body, so start with less. Those extracted from citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, grapefruit, and mandarin) can cause skin irritation, but are typically fine when diluted and applied to the skin in the form of a scrub.

Try a detoxing massage and Abhyanga. Abhyanga is a type of massage and plays an important role in [Ayurvedic practice and healing](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/coach-keya/traditional-ayurvedic-practices-get-you-through-winter). A lot of warm all-natural vegetable oil is stroked onto the whole body. It can be practiced as a self-massage on a regular (daily) basis. Abhyanga is a great way to detox and nourish the skin and body. It can be used for drawing toxins from the skin and addressing cellulite, a symptom of congested lymph. Massage is a great way to activate the muscles and lymph and stimulate the circulation and elimination of toxins through the lymph. Add essential oils to the abhyanga using less than 10 drops per oz, but as many as 12 to 15 can be used. 3. Dry brushing. While technically not an aromatherapy detox application, [dry brushing](https://www.yourtango.com/2018312055/what-dry-brushing-5-beauty-health-benefits-dry-brushing-skin) can be combined with an aromatherapy detox to enhance the detoxification process. Dry brushing moves energy and stimulates circulation and lymph, removing toxins in the process. It doesn't call for oils or aromatic essential oils. Related Stories From YourTango: As the name implies, no oils, creams, water, or other substances are used. Instead, a firm but soft brush is used to stroke the skin in a specific way: Long surface strokes toward the heart for long areas of the body, such as the arms and legs, and circular strokes for joints and the stomach. Dry brushing can be followed by a massage or abhyanga. Spring is a great time to detox from all those congesting winter foods and inactive pastimes. In fact, anytime you feel sluggish or congested, consider pampering yourself with an aromatherapy detox or abhyanga, and add some sensual and healing essential oils.
