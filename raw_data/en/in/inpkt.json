It tells the database that all the search terms must be included in the search results. - OR is used to combine words that have similar concepts or the same meaning. It tells the database that the search results can contain either or both words. - NOT is used to exclude words from your search results. - Use quotations (\" \") in your search when you have a specific search query. Using search quotes tells the database that you only want results that include these search terms in the exact form you typed them. - Use truncations, denoted by * to broaden your search to include a variety of spellings and word endings. Example: vaccin* = vaccine, vaccines, vaccination "}
