It's time to live life, pain-free. Roberta S. I have struggled with chronic sciatic pain for far too long. I couldn't even bend down to tie my shoes. Not only did AAIM help rid me of my pain I love going in for treatments because of everyone is so friendly! Paul N. My doctor said I was going to need surgery for my low back. I was in extreme pain every time I had to sit for longer that 10 minutes. I decided to try AAIM before getting surgery and have since been able to avoid surgery all together! My pain is almost completely gone and I no longer have to dread working at my desk every day. Andrea R. My husband and I had tried for years to have a baby. I had multiple failed IVF cycles and we were just heartbroken. I though my dreams of having a family would never come true. Dr. Brogdon helped me conceive after 4 months and was there for me throughout my pregnancy which was full of fear from my previous experiences. Every time I hold my son I am so grateful for the care I received at AAIM! Address 10400 Academy Rd.
