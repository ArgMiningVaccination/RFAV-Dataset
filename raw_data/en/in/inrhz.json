For the project described below, UNM Hospitals requests the following actions, with action requested only upon requisite sequential approval and recommendation by any and all committees and bodies: Board of Trustee Finance Committee approval of and recommendation of approval to the UNMH Board of Trustees. UNMH Board of Trustees approval of and recommendation of approval to the UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee. UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee approval and recommendation of approval to the UNM Board of Regents. UNM Board of Regents approval PROJECT DESCRIPTION: UNMH wishes to replace the existing PET/CT Scanner located on the first floor of the Clinical Neurosciences Center Building. This replacement will require significant room modifications, including additional shielding to meet code requirements. RATIONALE: This construction project is to renovate existing premises, making the equipment location suitable for the new PET/CT Scanner that has already been purchased (and approved by the Regents). Room modifications are required to meet current codes for installation of this new PET/CT. The project design includes enlarging the waiting room space to meet projected patient loads and rearranging the control space for improved staff efficiency during scanning procedures as well as shielding modifications to meet current codes. PURCHASING PROCESS: UNMH will utilize UNM's existing indefinite quantity (\"on-call\") construction contract with Jaynes Corporation, reference NMSA 13-1-135, Cooperative Procurement. The UNM construction contract arose via RFP process and supports individual projects of up to $1M, with a cumulative maximum of $10M over 3 years. FUNDING: The renovation costs are estimated at and shall not exceed $800,000. This will be funded by the FY19 and FY20 UNM Hospital Capital Renovation Fund. 5/98Repair, Renew, Replace Capital Project - UH Main Endoscopy Remodel Separator Page 6/98 CAPITAL PROJECT APPROVAL RESUBMITTAL PROJECT NAME : UH Main Endoscopy Remodel March 12, 2019 (Originally submitted to UNMH Board of Trustees September 2018) RECOMMENDED ACTION: As required by Section 7.12 of Board of Regents Policy Manual, the New Me xico Higher Education Department and the New Mexico State Board of Finance, capital project approval is requested for The UH Main - Endoscopy Remodel . For the project described below, UNM Hospitals requests the following actions, with action requested onl y upon requisite sequential approval and recommendation by any and all committees and bodies: Board of Trustee Finance Committee approval of and recommendation of approval to the UNMH Board of Trustees. UNMH Board of Trustees approval of and recommendatio n of approval to the UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee. UNM Board of Regents HSC Committee approval and recommendation of approval to the UNM Board of Regents. UNM Board of Regents approval PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project is to provide a new patient ch eck-in area for the endoscopy unit as well as a new staff workspace . The project will be conducted in three separate phases in the central lobby area of the 2ACC and the existing endoscopy unit located in UNMH Second Floor South. In the first phase t he existing snack bar in 2ACC will be demolished and the entrances to the existing restrooms re -routed to the west and east . Once the existing space in the 2ACC lobby area has been removed , construction will begin to create new offices and a patient check -in area. Once all the work is complete in the 2ACC lobby area staff will move over and occupy the new space in order to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is in the endoscopy unit and includes eliminating the locker area to expand the clean utility s torage . The existing check -in area will be enclosed to create a consultation room. The third phase will be to demolish the wall between the current break room and the adjacent off ice to create a new, larger echocardiogram room. RATIONALE: New patient ch eck-in area will help eliminate confusion among patients about where to check -in. The larger area will allow the department to accommodate more patients checking in while protecting the HIPAA rights . It will also give staff more visibility to monitor pati ents and ensure they are being assisted. The new staff work areas eliminates some of the share workspace which reduces productivity. The expansion will also allow for a private patient consultation room where providers can consult with patients concerni ng their diagnosis. Moving the employee locker room off the unit will allow for a larger equipment room that will help eliminate storing equipment in the corridors. PURCHASING PROCESS: Competitive RFP Process FUNDING: This project was originally submi tted for approval with an estimated construction cost of $400,000. The bids received via RFP exceeded th is estimate by more than 10% . The new project construction budget is not to exceed $550,000 . This will be funded from UNMH Hospital Capital Improvemen t Funds . 7/9802/22/19 UNMH Board of Trustees Meeting Minutes Separator Page 8/98 UNM Hospitals Board of Trustees February 22 , 2019 Barbara and Bill Richardson Pavilion 1 500 UNM Hospital s Board of Trustees Minutes - February 22, 2019 1 Agenda Item Subject/Discussion Action/Responsible Person Voting Members Present Dr. Jerry McDowell, Ms. Christine Glidden, Dr. Raymond Loretto, Ms. Debbie Johnson, Mr. Terry Horn, Mr. Nick Estes, Mr. Erik Lujan, Dr. Jennifer Phillips, and Mr. Joseph Alarid Ex-Officio Members Present Dr. Paul Roth, Dr. Michael Richards, Mrs. Kate Becker, and Dr. Davin Quinn County Officials Present Mr. Clay Campbell I.

P a g e | 2 Introduction The Infection Prevention and Control Department (IPCD) is part of University of New Mexico Hospitals (UNM Hospitals ) and within the Quality Outcomes Department . This document holds a comprehensive evaluation of current responsibilities , the annual risk assessment for the department, and the infection prevention and control plan for 201 9. The process is undertaken annually . The risk assessment and actions associated with updated priorities is completed at least annually but also when significant changes occur. Purpose The overall purpose of IPCD is to prevent infection transmission at UNM Hospitals among patients, visitors, staff, and providers. More specific goals include prevent ion of healthcare -acquired infections (HAIs) among patients and reduction of transmission of antibiotic -resistant organisms and other infectious diseases within hospi tal and clinic settings . Using epidemiological principles, pertinent data is collected and analyzed to detect trends, to determine risk factors associated with infection , to create evidence -based interventions to prevent transmission and infections , and to assess effectiveness of interventions . IPCD uses the current CDC National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN ) surveillance definitions for HAIs which enables comparison of our local data with national data to benchmark and to evaluate patient outcomes in com parison to nationwide trends . As a resource within UNM Hospitals and the community, Infection Preventionist s serve as resources on multidisciplinary teams established to prevent HAIs and other infections among everyone at UNM Hospitals and provide guidance to other professionals as well as the public about infection risks to enhance patient safety and quality. Scope of Service The scope of IPCD includes anyone who enters UNM Hospitals or its clinics, which includes all patients, employees, medical p ersonnel including faculty and providers, students , contract personnel, volunteers, and visitors. The practices of infection prevention and control are applied facility -wide and are an integral part of patient safety. The Hospital Epidemiologist s, Infection Prev entionists, and the Infection Control Committee, determine the specific focus of surveillance, education, and consultation efforts on an ongoing basis . This is dependent on hospital epidemiology, community disease surveillance , and real or perceived local or world threats. Mission Statement The mission of IPCD is to create a safe and high quality patient care and work environment and to protect patients, visitors, and staff through ongoing education, surveillance with analysis, information dissemination, and implementation of effective infection prevention methods. IPCD blends evidence -based recommendations with knowledge, skill, integrity, experience and creativity to accomplish our mission. The guiding principles listed below are intended to support UNM Hospitals in the areas of People, Service, Quality, Growth/Community, and Finance. People To engage everyone in a culture of patient safety through the use of infection prevention practices To support all healthcare workers in their daily practice to reduce all healthcare -associated infections To promote a safe patient care and working environment for everyone at UNM Hospitals To limit unprotected exposure to pathogens among everyone at UNM Hospitals Service To provide timely and useful resourc es and information to frontline healthcare workers To provide ongoing and meaningful analyses, information, and recommendations to leadership 22/98 2019 Infection Prevention and Control Plan This material is produced in connection with, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organ ization established at the University of New Mexico Hos pital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of the University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

P a g e | 3 about infection control issues Quality To routinely produce timely, valid, and pertinent information for any p resentation, report, education, and recommendations for all audiences To evaluate IPCD processes , products, and outcomes to continuously improve our effectiveness and efficiency and to evaluate our impact within the organization Growth/Community To provide effective education for patients , visitors, and their families about infection prevention To expand the capacity of IPCD to provide support to units and departments at UNM Hospitals To improve our response to ongoing or emergent infection control issues Finance To provide evidence -based infection prevention strategies in a cost-effective manner To enhance cost savings through continuous HAI reduction Infection Prevention and Control Program at UNM Hospitals (IC.01.03.01, EP 2 ) The Unified Ope rating Plan of the University Health System include achieving the goal of the safest hospital in New Mexico by delivering safe, high quality patient care. To achieve these goals, critical aspects of the Infection Prevention and Control Program include: Involvement and integration of key stakeholders for Infection Control Committee Meetings and Work Groups. Reporting infection surveillance, prevention and control information to appropriate hospital staff; federal, state and local public health authorities i n accordance with law and regulation; accrediting bodies; and the referring or receiving organization when a patient has been transferred or referred and the presence of an infection was not known at the time of the transfer or referral. Systems to communi cate with licensed independent practitioners, staff, students, volunteers, and , as appropriate, visitors, patients, and families about infection prevention and control issues, including their responsibilities in preventing the spread of infection within th e hospital. Applicable policies and procedures throughout UNM Hospitals to support the infection control program. A written Annual Report to the Quality Oversight Committee and UNM Hospitals Board of Trustees . A risk assessment of relevant and prioritized issues related to infection prevention and control performed annually. A written Infection Prevention and Control Plan completed annually . Risk assessment may occur more frequently based on perceived need. Resource Allocation - Needs for 2019 to effecti vely manage IPCD office (IC.01.02.01) Needs include approval of a ladder for advancement within the infection preventionist role, further funding for physician time for hospital epidemiology (to provide backup and to meet targets for hospital size), better coordination among entities within the University Health System, continued integration of infection control/antimicrobial stewardship, and further improvements in data management to meet demand for metrics and reporting requirements with ongoing support f or the decision support analysts within IPCD and Antimicrobial Stewardship. Risk Factors: Services Location (IC.01.03.01, EP 1 ) UNM Hospitals is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and includes UNM Hospitals , New Mexico Children's H ospital, and affiliated clinics. UNM Hospitals is currently a 5 27-bed hospital with 53 affiliated 23/98 2019 Infection Prevention and Control Plan This material is produced in connection with, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organ ization established at the University of New Mexico Hos pital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of the University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

Five of these conditions including cancer, heart disease, emphysema, stroke, and diabetes account for five of the leading six causes of death in New Mexico. Unintentional injuries remains ranked 3rd cause of death in New Mexico since 2012 . Approximately 20% of New Mexicans live in poverty and over 3 0% of the state's children live in poverty . Other issues affecting New Mexico include high rates of substance abuse which contribute to a high rate o f deaths due to drug and alcohol use and high rates of violence. https://ibis.health.state.nm.us/indicator/view/DthRateLdgCause.Cause.html Risk Factors: Infection Risks At UNM Hospitals , infection risks to patients relate to services and care provided and community risk. Risk of healthcare -associated infections depend upon interventions in the healthcare setting which include central line use, indwelling urinary catheters, surgical procedures, and mechanical ventilation. Antibiotic use, hand hygiene, p roper personal protective equipment use, and environmental cleaning all contribute to hospital -onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI). Prolonged hospital stay, antibiotic exposure, and infection control practices all contribute to transmission of ant ibiotic -resistant organisms (AROs). Surveillance activities, including data collection and analysis, are used to identify infection prevention and control risks pertaining to patients with a focus on HAIs , CDI, and AROs . 24/98 2019 Infection Prevention and Control Plan This material is produced in connection with, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organ ization established at the University of New Mexico Hos pital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of the University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

Unauthorized disclosure of this document, enclosures thereto, and information therefrom is strictly prohibited. P a g e | 5 Community infection risk is rout inely discussed with the New Mexico Dept of Health and also informed by Health Alerts. Influenza and other respiratory viruses circulate annually . Additionally, New Mexico has endemic enzoonotic infections such as Hantavirus, plague and tularemia which occ asionally cause infections in people. Lastly, although the incidence of tuberculosis is lower in New Mexico relative to other states, many patients are referred to UNM Hospitals for care and also may have more atypical presentations (e.g., extrapulmonary d isease). In the line of care, h ealthcare workers face the possibility of exposure to the following: Bloodborne Pathogen infections such as Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, and HIV via mucous membrane, cutaneous and parenteral exposure; due to high background ra tes of Hepatitis C in New Mexico, the risk of transmission is greatest for this bloodborne pathogen. Active pulmonary and/or extrapulmonary tuberculosis Other communicable diseases such as varicella zoster virus or pertussis Exposure to multi -drug resistan t organisms, such as methicillin -resistant gram rods (ESBLs), multi -drug organisms (MDROs), and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Surveillance Process Based upon risk factors at UNM Hospitals and impacts on morbidity and mortality, healthcare -acquired infection surveillance is targeted toward high -risk areas, including the critical care and progressive care units and device -associated Infections . The methodology is described in the Appendix A: \"Infection Control Surveillance Procedure .\" Surveillance for device -associated HAIs is conducted by the Infection Prevent ionist s in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. T his involves a determination as to whether the infection was present or incubating at the time of hospital admission (within the first 2 days of admission). The Infect ion Prevention and Control Department (IPCD) may collaborate with representatives of other University of New Mexico Hospital departments who collect and monitor additional data relative to infection incidence or prevention. This data is then reported at t he Infection Control Committee meetings and others , as appropriate. This includes, but is not limited to the Emergency Department Operations meetings , Quality Operations meetings, Surgical Quality meetings , Critical Care Committee meetings, Pediatric Quali ty meetings (CHPIPSC), and Progressive Care Unit meetings . Information , ongoing activities, and recommendations derived from the data are reported to the Infection Control Committee, Quality Oversight Committee , Medical Executive Committee , HSC Quality and Safety Committee, Safety Committee, and/or Hospital Board, as appropriate. These data include but are not limited to: 25/98 2019 Infection Prevention and Control Plan This material is produced in connection with, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organ ization established at the University of New Mexico Hos pital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of the University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

The Infection Control Surveillance Procedure for UNM Hospitals for the current year may be found in Appendix A of this document. The surveillance plan focuses primarily upon our antibiotic resistant microorganisms (MRSA, VRE, ESBL, MDR O, CRE ); targeted surgical site infections; central line associated blood stream infections; catheter - associate d urinary tract infections; hospital -onset Clostridium difficile infections; ventilator -associated events (adults) and pneumonia (pediatrics) ; communicable disease reporting as required by the New Mexico Department of Health Administrative Code. It also i ncludes monitoring of important preventive processes, such as hand hygiene compliance and Environmental Infection Control issues . Additional surveillance data may be received from other areas relative to infection prevention and related issues. This info rmation will be included as part of the overall infection control program, as appr opriate. Infection control data is reviewed over time to determine the effectiveness of interventions which will be redesigned, as necessary. Authority and Responsibili ty The Infection Control Committee members have the overall authority and responsibility for the Infection Prevention and Control Prog ram. The Infection Prevention and Control Department has primary responsibility for the daily management of infection prev ention and control activities. This includes developing and implementing policies that govern control of infections and communicable diseases and developing a system for identifying, reporting, investigating and controlling infections and communicable diseases. The Infection Preventionist has authority to institute any surveillance, prevention, and control measures or studies when there is reason to believe that any patient or personnel may be in danger from a potential or actual outbreak of, or exposure, to infectious disease. All employees have responsibility for adherence to infection prevention and control processes/strategies. 26/98 2019 Infection Prevention and Control Plan This material is produced in connection with, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organ ization established at the University of New Mexico Hos pital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of the University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

Case Review Antibiotic -resistant organisms (AROs) o The IPs log all resistant organisms on appropriate line list these are evaluated as community or hospital -acquired i nfection s. o The IPs record all resistant organisms via the Electronic Health Record via an adhoc form to communicate ARO history via the patient information banner as \"IC HX:\" Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) o Appropriate laboratory data initiates the process of review for healthcare associated infections. o Chart s are review ed to determine if HAIs are present using Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and definitions. Reportable communicable diseases o Records of patients with reportable com municable diseases are reviewed. o Reportable diseases as required by state statute are collected and reported to the New Mexico Department of Health. Management of occupational exposures to communicable diseases o For patients with tuberculosis, varicella/di ssemin ated zoster, meningococcus, pertussis , and other needed diseases lists of potentially exposed healthcare workers are generated. They are screened for exposures using standardized definitions. A refined list of exposed healthcare workers is sent to th e appropriate occupational health entity for further follow -up. Surgical Schedules and patients records are reviewed and data collected to determine the presence of Surgical Site Infection (SSI). 37/98 2019 Infection Prevention and Control Plan This material is produced in connection with, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organ ization established at the University of New Mexico Hos pital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of the University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

P a g e | 18 Data Analysis Threshold s/Benchmark s Thresholds are esta blished through analysis of current scientific knowledge, national norms, University of New Mexico Hospitals historical data , and other references. Benchmarks are established through comparison analysis with external databases, such as the CDC's National Health Safety Network (NHSN) . HAI data is compared with national data and presented at various committees and meetings as indicated. ARO data is analyzed as follows: o Rates are calculated by using the number of i solates as the numerator and patient and/or device days as the denominator. This number is multiplied by 1000 to give an infection rate per 1000 patient or device days. o When a trend is identified it may be referred to as a \"cluster\" or an \"outbreak\". This situation requires further action. If comm on factors are not identified, no action may be required. If analyses of successive months determine the pattern is continuing, a more aggressive investigation will be implemented. The design of this investigation will be determined by Infection Preventi on and Control, the Hospital Epidemiologist, and others significantly involved. The data is shared with the Infection Control Committee, Quality Oversight Committee, Medical Executive Committee, and/or Medical staff and Nursing staff, as appropriate . An ac tion plan is established and implemented. The effectiveness of the plan is evaluated. Reporting of Findings Analysis of surveillance findings is presented to the Infection Control Committee on at least a quarterly basis. All \"cluster\" evaluations will b e reported to the Infection Control Committee. The Infection Control Committee minutes and summary report is shared with the Infection Control Committee, Quality Oversight Committee, Medical Executive Committee, and/or Medical staff and Nursing staff, as a ppropriate. 38/98 Appendix B Infection Prevention and Control Score Card (2017 - 2018) P a g e | 1 This material is produced in connection wit h, and for the purpose of the Patient Safety Evaluation System and/or Review Organization established at the University of Ne w Mexico Hospital, and is therefore confidential Patient Safety Work Product (\"PSWP\") and/or confidential peer review material of t he University of New Mexico Hospital as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.20 and/or the Review Organizations Immunity Act, Section 41 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978 as amended (ROIA).

Page 1 of 6 REPORT TO QUALITY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE Infection Prevention and Control Department (IPCD) December 2018 I. Background The UNMH Infection Prevention and Control Department (IPCD) uses a risk assessment tool and guidance from multiple resources (e.g., the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Association for Professionals in Infec tion Control (APIC) , the Society for Heal thcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) , New Mexico Department of He alth (NMDOH), and University of New Mexico Hospitals internal data (UNMH ) to develop the Infection Control Plan and corresponding Infection Control Program . This process sets the standards for inf ection prevention practices to promote patient safety and hi gh quality care. Regulatory requirements of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ), The Joint Commission (TJC) (including National Patient Safety Goals ), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are incorporated into the I nfection Control Plan and key departmental activities. Surveillance is conducted by IPCD and others engaged in infection control efforts to track practices and outcomes that relate to healthcare -associated infections (HAIs) and to infection transmission in the healthcare setting . Current surveillance by IPCD includes: Hand hygiene (HH) Central blood stream infections Surgical site infections (SSIs) among patients undergoing colon operations, abdominal hysterectomy and Cesarean sections Healthcare personnel influenza vaccination rates for each influenza season Antibiotic -resistant organisms including enterococcus (VRE) Ventilator -associated Pneumonia (VAP) for pediat ric patients Most HAIs are reported to CDC via the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and then onto CMS. HAI rates impact UNMH reimbursement and are also publicly reported by CMS and Leapfrog . The New Mexico Department of Health annually publishes the HAI Report annually and compares hospitals within the state of New Mexico . Most importantly, each multidisciplinary HAI leadership team uses the data to assess trends and ongoing issues, to update and guide priorities, and to develop associated interve ntions with the goal of reducing patient harm.

Page 2 of 6 III. Accomplishments by Topic (2018 Infection Control Plan by priority and review of d ata through Q 2 2018 unless otherwise indicated). Hand Hygiene o Inpatient Hand hygiene rates remain stable relative to 2016 (91% FY 2018 ). Overall, above our goal of 90%; however, various roles and different locations have rates less than 90%. Additionally, there remain concerns about bias based on current collection m ethods. Planned pilot for electronic hand hygiene surveillance in order to improve direct feedback and identify how each healthcare worker's hand hygiene performance can improve (e.g., before patient care). Using UNMH -created Hand Hygiene Surveillance database for unit-level data collection and reporting since Jan 1, 2017. Enables easier data entry, improves data validity, and enables real - time hand hygiene reports which may be retrieved directly by unit directors , medical directors, and executive directo rs. Ongoing work of the Hand Hygiene Leadership Team (started Sept 2017, multidisciplinary team) has ongoing projects: Improving accountability by developing standardized feedback and escalation processes (both hospital and school of medicine employees) Improving availability of hand gel by increasing hand gel dispensers. Ongoing, s uccessful summer volunteer program in which volunteers were intensively trained to perform hand hygiene monitoring at UNMH. Volunteer data showed rates of 68% for hand hygiene compliance (less-biased data). Continued with \"Train the Observer\" education lead by \"Healthy Hands Resource Squad\" (HHRS) . Monthly classes for hand hygiene observers to standardize inpatient practices for hand hygiene observations . o Outpatient/ambulatory Standardiz ing hand hygiene observations among all clinics using patient observations. Health literacy has been involved to create simple, patient -centered data collection sheets which identify providers and other clinic staff by specific attire. 50 out of 60 clinics , including home health and hospice, have rolled this out. CLABSI s o Vascular Access Leadership Team (VALT ): ongoing multidisciplinary group created to improve our care of vascular access at UNMH Created vascular access updates with rollout in Nov 2017. Key updates included: nursing documentation of reason for temporary central line; extended duration of peripheral intravenous access based on function; simplified elements of vascular access documentation. Rollout of new central line dressings hospital -wide in February and March of 2018. Updated unit self -auditing process for alcohol -impregnated caps (curos) for vascular access. Units with high performance for a quarter (>90% ) earn a 6-month reprieve from curos audi ts because the practice appears to be more hardwired . Continued a semi -annual vascular access assess ment on all inpatient units (completed by VALT and IPCD team members ) to assess overall care for vascular access . Integrated just -in- time coaching to provid e real -time feedback to nursing staff when issues id entified. Ongoing issues included dating peripheral IVs . Curos cap compliance data corroborates unit overall performance >85% (goal 90%). 48/98 Appendix C PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - The information contained herein was acquired or generated by, for and/or on behalf of a \"review organization\" (RO) as defined in the Review Organization Immunity Act (ROIA), \u00a74 1 -9-1 et seq., NMSA 1978, for the purposes of evaluating and improving the quality of health care services rendered by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.

Page 3 of 6 Impact of pediatric pilot (started 2017) with a modification to the needleless connector change procedure helped reduce CLABSIs particularly among pediatric heme -onc patients. Therefore, this updated needleless connector change procedure will be disseminated hospital -wide in Q1 2019. Created an adult vascular access algorithm to help providers, nursing and physicians select the most appropriate vascular access for their patient (based on guidelines). Rolled out to key provider/physician groups at UNMH and planned rollout to nursing in Q1 2019. Working to harmonize all vascular access education (e.g., online, annual competencies, etc.) and resources (e.g., Vascular Access Device Procedure, Lippincott). Other ongoing subgroups include updates to the blood culture collection procedure an d standardization of training for ultrasound -guided peripheral IV placement. o Central Line Insertion Leadership Team Creating a process map for central line insertion to discern optimal timing and method for collecting data regarding observation of central line insertion practices . Focusing on adult ICUs and p ilot planned for NSI. Develop ing a standardized training program regarding central line insertion practices for off - service residents and APPs for all 3 adult ICUs. Creat ed videos to assist with standardized central line insertion practices at UNMH. o Continuing the Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA ) review process for all patients with CLABSI s. o Expanded the IMPROVE -IT pilot to 6 inpatient units (4E, 5W, 3N, 6S, MICU, TSI) to create standardiz ed patient safety rounds conducted each shift by RN Supervisors. Patients are evaluated for Foley catheters and temporary central lines to review for documentation discrepancies (e.g., central line not documented in electronic medical record but physically present in the patient) and address ongoing necessity. Additionally, patients with SCD orders are reviewed to see if SCDs are in place and the pump is turned on. Overall goal is to standardize this practice with the intention of reduc ing adverse patient events , specifically CAUTIs, VTEs, and CLABSIs. CAUTI: o CAUTI Work Group : ongoing multidisciplinary group created to improve our care of Foley catheters and reduce patients' risk for CAUTIs at UNMH Surgical Staff subgroup developed clearer guidance for Foley catheter placement in the OR setting. This included standardization of documentation by the OR and PACU. Currently the subgroup is on PDSA cycle #2 working to improve documentation focusing on co rrect indications. Group established to clarify practices and process related to Foley catheter care and pericare . Initial survey of frontline nursing demonstrated highly variable practices. Next steps include development of a standardized process with cr eation of educational resources and pilot on key units. External female catheters successfully trialed on 3 adult inpatient units. Rollout with associated educational materials is planned for hospital -wide (adult) use in early 2019. o Developed focused grou p for assessing areas for interventions to reduce CAUTIs in the NSI (based on number of CAUTIs in the NSI without demonstrated improvement in 2018).

Page 6 of 6 o Working with nursing informatics and specific units to compare automated vs. manual central line and Foley catheter day counts used for HAI reporting. Current Status. The intention is to rely upon electronic/automated data to reduce nursing workload associated with manual counts, to improve upon documentation (i.e., data valid ity), and to reduce variability of data. This effort also helps to lead UNMH to eventually being able to rely upon the Electronic data for submission to our reviewing entities. Once there is a correlation between manual and electronic counts of 95% agree ment, NHSN will allow the submission of data collected electronically. Submitting data electronically will save many hours of labor involved in performing manual counts. We will also then be able to rely upon the device related data in our surveillance tool, Theradoc, to help reduce the effort in device associated infection investigation. Currently 7 of the 15 units have passed validation and are completely on electronic r eporting. 52/982019 IPCD Risk Assessment SCORE Potential Risks/Problems Expected Rare NeverCatastrophic Loss Serious LossProlonged LOSModerate clinical/financialMinimal clinical/financial None Poor Fair Good Solid 4 3 2 1 0 5 4 3 2 1 5 4 3 2 1 MRSA (Screening, Invasive infections) 4 3 3 36 C difficile 4 4 4 64 Antibiotic Resistant Organisms (CRE,VRE,ESBL/MDRO/GN) 4 4 3 48 Respiratory viruses 4 3 2 24 Legionella (nosocomial) 1 3 1 3 Fungal infections 1 3 2 6 Surgical Site Infection (SSI) 4 4 3 48 Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSIs) 3 4 3 36 Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) 4 3 4 48 Ventilator Associated Event/Pneumonia (VAE/VAP) 3 3 4 36 Outbreaks of communicable diseases 3 2 2 12 Influenza and Norovirus outbreaks 2 4 3 24 Infrastructure Collapse Planning 1 2 2 4 Critical Incident Planning 1 2 1 2 Influx of large numbers of infectious patients 1 2 3 6 Pandemic Preparedness 1 5 3 15 Highly Infectious Disease (HID) Preparedness 2 5 3 30 Blood and Body Fluid Exposures (HIV, Hep B, and Hep C) 4 3 3 36 Tuberculosis (TB) Exposures 4 2 3 24 Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Exposures 4 2 3 24 Pertussis Exposures 4 2 3 24 Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) 3 2 2 12 Healthcare Worker (HCW) Influenza Vaccination 4 2 2 16 HCW Vaccine and PPD Policy Compliance 3 2 2 12 Hospital Environment Cleaning 3 3 2 18 Pre-Construction IC Planning/Risk Assessments 2 1 1 2 Waste Disposal 2 2 2 8 Cleaning & Disinfecting of patient care equipment 4 3 4 48 Hemodialysis Dialysate Testing 1 4 2 8 Water Testing 1 4 2 8 Air Exchange and Pressure Monitoring 2 3 1 6 Sterilization Biologic Monitoring/Flash Sterilization 1 3 1 3 High level disinfection 4 3 3 36 Contamination/Infection from Pharmacy Environment 1 3 2 6 Hand Hygiene 4 4 4 64 Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette 4 2 2 16 Isolation & PPE Practices 4 4 3 48 Patient Immunization (Influenza, Pneumococcal) 4 2 3 24 * Risk Assessment for probability of communicable diseases is based on analysis of previous year's UNMH specific exposure data Employee Health and Safety* Environment of Care Prevention ActivitiesProbability Risk/Impact (Health, Financial, Legal, Regulatory) Current Systems/Preparedness Heathcare-Associated PH.D. 55/98Why MISSION: Excellence?

Quality: UNMH continues the drive to improve overall quality and patient experience by focusing on items of low performance in the Vizi ent Quality and Safet y report, specifically mortality and hospital acquired infection. The Vizient data has been released for January 2019 and UNMH stands with six of the eight indicators in the green which indicates at or better than goal. Statistics (Financial data): As of the end of February the UNMH inpatient volume is lower compared to prior year. UNMH also continues to see a shift of patients from inpatient status to observation status. Total patient days are 4% lower than budget with adult patient days accounting for a -3% variance. Adult equivalent observation days are up 15%, or 1,325 days from budget. Total pediatric days are down 7% to budget most likely related to seasonality. Inpatient discharges are 8% lower than budget and 3 % lower compared to prior year activity. Outpatient visits are 1% below budget year to date through February and 2% higher compared to prior year. Emergency visits are 9% lower than budget and 12% less than prior year. Case mix index remains greater than prior year and average length of stay is down 2% compared to prior year. Financial: Net margin year to date is positive at $9,890,000. Net patient revenues continue on a positive trend while salaries, benefits, purchased services and medical services c ontinue trending over budget. Strategic Planning: Management continues to make positive progress in partnering with Bernalillo County regarding the planning of behavioral health programs to improve access and diversify treatment options available to the community. Management will provide an update to the Bo ard once the plans become more solidified . Human Resources: The turnover rate rolling year -to-date is 15.55% for the full workforce and 13.65% for nurses. This represents a slight increase over the last quarter results and exceeds the goal of 15% for the full workforce and below the goal for the nurse specific workforce. Overall hiring is in pace with the current turnover rates. UNMH currently has 5,957 FTEs which is 493.98 (7.66%) less than budget. The Medical Crisis Leave Bank campaign ran for the month of February and we had 1,425 employees generously donate a total of 7,458 hours. Employee wellness screenings are in full swing, with several hundred employees receiving biometric screenings each week. Full contract negotiations are continuing for the 1199 Licensed & Technical and 1199 Support Staff bargaining units. Our Accountable Care Act requirements were met in providing employ ees with notice of health coverage for the last calendar year and our file was submitted to the IRS for compliance with this regulation. Native American Liaison : Management is working with 638 Pueblos to secure agreements for the 100% Medicaid Federal M atch \"FMAP\". Currently, we have agreements out for approval to Isleta and Jemez pueblos. The quarterly report is due on March 8th for the last quarter of 2018; we are on track for completion. Outpatient referrals are up while inpatient transfers and admissions are steady. We are anticipating our first consultative session with the All Pueblo Council of Governors on April 18, 2019. Bernalillo County : UNMH met with County Commissioners to provide an overview of the statistics and budget assumptions for the 2020 Budget. The budget will be reviewed in April to provide an overview of the actual budget version that will go forward for approvals. An overview of Behavioral Health Program Development was discussed as well. If there are any questions on this or other matters, please feel free to contact me. 88/98CMO Report UNM Hospitals Separator Page 89/98 To: Board of From: Irene Agostini, MD UNMH Chief Medical Officer Date: March 29, 2019 Subject: Monthly Medical Staff and Hospital Activity Update 1. The average wait time for a patient from the Adult Emergency Department to be placed after admission for the month of February was 9 hours and 12 minutes. This is up from February of 2018 when the average wait time was 7 hours and 6 minutes . UNMH remain s greater than 90% capacity on average . We continue to ensure surgeries are not canceled due to capacity . 47 patients were triaged to an SRMC Inpatient unit instead of placing at UNM Hospital . 2. The Community Partnershi p with Lovelace Health system continues to be successful in putting the needs of the \"P atient First\", allowing continued access to those patients that can only be cared for by UNMH. In the month of November: 86 patients were triaged from the UNM Health System being directly accepted into the Lovelace Health System . 3. Our ALOS (Adult without OB ) for February 2019 was 6.81, an increase as com pared to February 2018 which was 6.27 . Our ALOS FYTD for 2019 is 6.73 an overall improvement from FYTD 2018 when it was 6.90. We continue to hardwire our processes to decrease our ALOS despite accepting higher acuity patients by planning for discharge upon patient admit . Our length of s tay index for adults without OB for January was 0. 95 with a Case mix index (CMI) of 2.37 as reported through our nationally comparative systems network Vizi ent. 4. Our \"LEADing to Excellence\" work continues with much of our focus centered on change leadership with key takeaways on our continued journey to Hardwiring Excellence to include the following: We are in this together, removing the \"us\" vs. \"them\" men tality Critical Conversations, High/Solid/Low performers Huron engagement and Excellence Journey Standard work, accountability and expectations Realignment of departments and services and work 5. UNMH Surgical Serv ices foundational structure is to create reliable process to serve the needs of New Mexican's has preliminarily shown good results in the on -time start of operating room cases. In the month of February the UNMH main OR has a 54% on-time s tart of all cases, BBRP has a 58 % and OSIS has a 61% on -time start. The team has begun to monitor and measure the time it takes to turn an OR room over (TOT) to be available for the next scheduled patient surgery. For the month of February the TOT was 57 minutes for the UNMH main OR, and OSIS has a 33 minute TOT and BBRP monitors TOT by specialty. We will continue to monitor and report this vital step in creating efficiency and safety for our patients. 90/98Finance Committee Separator Page 91/98 UNM HOSPITAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES Finance Committee Meeting Wednesday , March 27 , 2019 10:00 AM UNM Hospitals Administration, Large Conference Room Objectives Provide financial and human resources oversight of UNM Hospitals.
