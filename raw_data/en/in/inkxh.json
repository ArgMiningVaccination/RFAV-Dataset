This decision is in keeping with industry standards as COVID-19 case counts have climbed in recent weeks. \"It's important each one of us do our part to help slow the spread of this fast spreading Covid variant,\" Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said. \"These measures will help get more folks vaccinated and make it safer for people to see shows at our beloved Veterans Memorial Coliseum. We are all ready for Covid to be over, and I'm as hopeful as anyone that these steps are temporary and more people will get vaccinated to stop this virus from sickening more families.\" Those looking to attend a ticketed event at the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum can show their vaccination card, a picture of their vaccination card or a copy of their state immunization registry to ticket takers or security working near the entrance of the building. Alternatively, attendees can provide a copy of a negative COVID-19 test that is not more than 72 hours old and wear a mask while inside the Coliseum. The Alliant Energy Center will also encourage attendees to wear masks at all events. Masks and hand sanitizer stations will also be distributed where appropriate. Other buildings on the Alliant Energy Center campus have the flexibility in their layouts to allow for appropriate social distancing, unlike the Coliseum. \"Our chief concern at the Alliant Energy Center has always been public safety,\" said Alliant Energy Center Executive Director Brent McHenry. \"We want to ensure that the Alliant Energy Center remains a place where people can have fun in a safe and responsible manner. We believe that this decision bolsters that mission.\" The vaccination or negative test requirement are two of many steps the Alliant Energy Center is taking to ensure health and public safety. The Center is also a certified Global Biorisk Advisory Council Star facility and has installed a cutting-edge ionization system designed to pull viruses like COVID-19 out of the air. "}
