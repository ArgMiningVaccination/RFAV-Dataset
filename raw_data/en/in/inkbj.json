{"title": "Temporomandibular Disorder Treated With Chiropractic Therapy", "author": "Eric Chun-Pu Chu; Wai Ting Lee; Cherie Chau; Emmanuel Wong; Hay Yeung Cheng", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are common and affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding musculoskeletal tissues. Although traditional rehabilitative treatments such as physiotherapy, occlusal splints, orthodontics, and electrotherapy effectively manage TMDs, chiropractic therapy is emerging as a promising non-invasive treatment option. We report a 39-year-old female patient with TMD who underwent chiropractic therapy, including spinal adjustments, soft tissue therapy, and exercise rehabilitation. After four weeks of treatment, the patient reported a complete resolution of symptoms and an improved quality of life score. Thereafter, the patient continued chiropractic treatment monthly for six months, during which she reported no symptoms and demonstrated improvements in her spinal range of motion, open-mouth anatomy, and cervical lordosis. This case study highlights the efficacy of applying an interdisciplinary approach to treating TMD and the potential of chiropractic therapy as a valuable treatment option for managing TMD.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-03-19", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
