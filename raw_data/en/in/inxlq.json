Now he contorts his body into odd positions and meditates. \"Two hours of yoga is like having a couple of martinis,\" says the 48-year-old recovering alcoholic, who requested an alias for this story. \"I thought it would be really boring, but it's very relaxing and enjoyable.\" Both booze and yoga are forms of escaping stress and inducing pleasure, he says. But alcohol brings a temporary high in which too much can rob the drinker of mental, spiritual and physical well being, Midland says, whereas yoga brings a lasting pleasure that nourishes the soul and helps the practitioner fill an internal void that liquor could never quench. \"Yoga makes you focus inwardly on yourself and it helps fulfill your spiritual needs, whereas alcohol makes you ignore them even more,\" he says. Midland is well aware that his words have a decidedly new-age ring, and that skeptics might dismiss his talk as the euphoria of a new convert into the world of abstinence. But Midland insists that this new approach has achieved success where more traditional treatment programs have failed. As a recent graduate of a newly established addictions program at Duke called The Middle Path, Midland says he is armed with a cadre of skills that he hopes will prevent a relapse into his old habits. Yoga is simply his favorite among the wide range of techniques designed to teach patients the art of mindfulness, a mind-body approach that helps a person live in the moment instead of the future. \"Mindfulness is about living your life as it comes rather than living it like a dress rehearsal,\" says Dr. Marty Sullivan, a Duke cardiologist who recommends the technique to patients interested in mind-body approaches to healing. Why mindfulness works for addicts is no mystery, says Bohdan Hrynewych, the Duke addictions counselor who created The Middle Path to complement traditional addiction programs at Duke. The program's name embodies its philosophy of avoiding extremes in behavior or action, a trait that is common among pleasure-seeking addicts of all kinds. \"Our culture and society are very materialistic, and they encourage people to achieve satisfaction through external recognition, acquiring goods and material pursuits - all of which bring temporary pleasure but fail to fill an inner void,\" Hrynewych says. \"Addicted people in particular are apt to get fixated on external sources of comfort, excitement and satisfaction.\" Replacing those external sources with an internal source of pleasure - one that addicts can learn to conjure up on their own - can be a more intensive strategy for beating addiction than traditional means of just talking about the problem or replacing it with another external pursuit, like shopping, gambling or sex, he says. Already, there is evidence to suggest that a spiritual approach to treating addiction makes scientific sense, says Duke psychiatrist Dr. Roy Mathew. In a series of brain imaging studies at Duke, Mathew has shown that drugs like marijuana stimulate the very same pleasure centers in the brain that are stimulated by spiritual experiences, such as beautiful music or cuddling your baby. Mathew surmises this is why mindfulness works, because it teaches people to replace a destructive form of pleasure for another, more constructive one. Specifically, mindfulness teaches people to pay attention to what is happening in the moment instead of looking ahead to the future. \"Focus on the thought going through your mind at the moment, feel the sensation of the wind on your face at the beach, detach yourself from the pressure and content of your mind for a minute or two and you become freer from committing compulsive, automatic actions,\" says Mathew, director of the Duke Addictions Program, from which The Middle Path grew. It's a Buddhist concept that is hard to grasp for people accustomed to living in the frenzied pace of modern society, where external pressures rule their lives, he says. But that's precisely the point of mindfulness - to escape the external pressures by turning your attention inward and developing detachment from situations where you feel you have no choice. Then, you can discover your essential freedom and power. Hrynewych says such an approach is unique among the many addiction treatment programs at Duke and nationwide, most of which are based on the 12-step program of recovery first adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous. The 12-step programs invite participants to recognize that they cannot control their addiction, to call on a higher power to help them abstain, to make amends to loved ones they have hurt, and to agree to help other addicts in their quest to recover. The Middle Path combines AA's traditional approach to abstinence and reform -- replacing the emphasis on God with a focus on spirituality -- together with a wide range of spiritually based techniques. \"We're not discarding the 12-step program; we recognize its value,\" he says. \"The Middle Path is really 12-steps plus.\" Participants in The Middle Path go through intensive group and individual therapy, family therapy, body-centered therapies like yoga that focus on the physical and spiritual discomfort of withdrawal, visual and creative therapies like drawing and sculpting with clay and acupuncture -- a technique that research suggests may be useful in alleviating cravings and helping maintain long-term abstinence. In the future, the program may include other techniques like biofeedback and massage. \"During one session, we made clay images of how we viewed our families - where we put our wife, kids, pets - to help us come to terms with the way we viewed essential relationships,\" Midland says. \"It may sound nuts, but it was a lot more real and practical than hearing about the chemical makeup of alcohol.\" The spiritual nature of The Middle Path is what drew Midland to the Duke program after traditional groups like AA - which he still attends weekly - were unable to meet all of his needs. \"At AA meetings, it's very externally focused. You tell your story and someone tells his, but there's generally no feedback. The Middle Path program is much more internally based while, paradoxically, emphasizing interpersonal relationships. You talk about what Tom or Mary said and you deal with it in a very direct, focused way. Then you actually get to practice new ways of behaving with others in the group.\" Four months have passed since Midland completed the eight-week program, and the road has been bumpy at times. A couple of months out of the program, Midland says he \"fell off the wagon\" and then realized he had to search deeper in his repertoire of skills to bolster his resolve to abstain. That's when he added a four-mile bike ride and swimming to his routine, both of which he does while meditating. \"It's been a breath of fresh air for me,\" Midland says, two months after stepping up his personal regimen of meditation and exercise. \"The program may not be for everybody, but it was great for me.\" In particular, says Hrynewych, The Middle Path program may be well suited for people with a \"dual diagnosis\" - those with an addiction and an underlying psychiatric disorder - because it focuses on all aspects of a person's life and because participants can receive psychiatric consultation at Duke in conjunction with their addictions treatment. The Duke Addictions Program also offers treatment programs specifically geared toward women, HIV-positive addicts, adolescents, addicted mothers and adults who grew up in addicted families. [News & "}
