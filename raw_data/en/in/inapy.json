Therefore, the objectives of these reviews are to identify scientific evidence and i nternational guidance on surveillance and testing approaches to monitor the presence of the virus in a vaccinated population. Method: We searched Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae, including Epub Ahead of Print, In -Process & Other Non - Indexed Citations, Embase, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We also searched the Web of Science Core Collection. A grey literature search was also conducted. This search was limited to studies conducted since December 2020 and current to June 13th, 2021. There were no language limitations. COVID -19 surveillance studies that were published after December 2020 but did not specify whether they tested a vaccinated population were also considered for inclusion. For the international guidance review, a grey literature search was conducted, including a thorough search of Google, websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]), and McMaster Health Forum (CoVID -END). This search was primarily examining surveillance guidance published since December 2020 (to capture guidance specific to vaccinations) and any relevant pre -December 2020 guidance. Results: Thirty -three studies were included for data synthesis of scientific evidence on surveillance of COVID -19. All the studies were published between April and June 2021. Twenty -one studies were from peer-reviewed journals. Five approaches to monitoring post -vaccination COVID -19 cases a nd emerging variants of concern were identified, including screening with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) and/or a rapid antigen test, genomic surveillance, wastewater surveillance, metagenomics, and testing of air filters on publi c buses. For population surveillance, the following considerations and limitations were observed: variability in person -to-person testing frequency; lower sensitivity of antigen tests; timing of infections relative to PCR testing can result in missed infec tions; large studies may fail to identify local variations; and loss of interest in testing by participants in long follow -up studies. Through comprehensive grey literature searching, 68 international guidance documents were captured for full -text review . A total of 26 documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in our synthesis. Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR -testing was the most recommended surveillance method, followed by genomic screening, serosurveill ance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. Conclusion: Evidence for post -vaccination COVID -19 surveillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations.

Therefore, the objectives of these reviews are to: 1) identify scientific evidence on surveil lance and testing approaches to monitor the presence of the virus in a vaccinated population and determine how these influence testing strategies; 2) identify international guidance on testing and surveillance for COVID -19 and its variants of concern in a vaccinated population; and 3) identify emerging technologies for surveillance . Design: A rapid review was conducted to identify scientific evidence on COVID -19 surveillance and testing approaches, and a targeted literature review was conducted on international guidance . Method: We searched Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae, including Epub Ahead of Print, In -Process & Other Non - Indexed Citations, Embase, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Revi ews. We also searched the Web of Science Core Collection. We performed all searches on June 13, 2021 . A grey literature search was also conducted, including: MedRxiv, Google, McMaster Health Forum (C OVID-END), and websites of international government organ izations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]). This search was limited to studies conducted since December 2020 and current to June 13th, 2021. There were no language limitations. COVID -19 surveillance st udies that were published after December 2020 but did not specify whether they tested a vaccinated population were also considered for inclusio n. For the international guid ance r eview, a grey literature search was conducted, including a thorough search of Google, websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]), and McMaster Health Forum (CoVID -END). This search was primarily examining surveillance guidance published since December 2020 (to capture guidance specific to vaccinations) and any relevant pre -December 2020 guid ance . Although the primary focus was on surveillance guidance in a vaccinated population, guidance that was published after December 2020 but was not vaccine -specific was also considered for inclusion ; it was assumed that this guidance was still in effect and was not yet updated . There were no language limitations. A patient partner was engaged during the co -production of a plain language summary for both the rapid review of primary literature and the review of international guidance . Results: Thirty -three studies were included for data synthesis of scientific evidence on surveillance of COVID -19. All the studies were published between April and J une 2021. Twenty -one studies were from peer-reviewed journals. Five approaches to monitoring post -vaccination COVID -19 cases and emerging variants of concern were identified including, screening with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) and/or a rapid antigen test, genomic surveillance, wastewater surveillance, metagenomics, and testing of air filters on public buses.

The frequency of testing varied depending on whether there was an outbreak. For population surveillance, the following considerations and limitations were observed : studies with discretionary access to testing have highly variable person -to-person testing frequency; antigen tests have lower sensitivity, therefore some positive cases may be missed; timing of infections relative to PCR testing as well as the sensitivity of the test s can result in missed infections; large sample sizes from multicentre studies increase generalizability, but fail to identify local variations from individual centres; with electronic database surveillance, it is difficult to confirm whether patients with a breakthrough infection and a previous positive SARS -CoV-2 test result had a true reinfection or had prolonged shedding from the previous infection; and participants lose interest in studies with long follow -up, with decrease in testing rates over time. Six wastewater surveillance and three genomic surveillance studies were identified in this review. A number of benefits such as, good correlation with clinical data , ability to predict major outbreaks , and rapid turnaround time were observed with wastewate r surveillance. However, challenges such as, inconsistencies in variant representation depending on where the samples were taken within the community, differences in the capacity of wastewater to predict case numbers based on the size of the wastewater tre atment plants , and cost, were noted. Emerging technologies like viral detection in public transport filters, novel sampling , and assay platforms were also identified. Through comprehensive grey literature searching, 68 international guidance documents were captured for full -text review. A total of 26 documents met the inclusion criteria and were included in our synthesis. Most were not specific to vaccinated populations but reported on a surveillance method of COVID -19 and were therefore included in the review; it was assumed that they were still in effect but have not yet been updated. Eleven countries/regions were represented, including Australia, Brazil, France, Germa ny, India, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Europe, and International. All of the guidance documents included surveillance methods appropriate for community settings. Other settings of interest were healthcare setting s, including hospital s and primary care centres, long -term care facilities, points of entry for travel, schools, and other sentinel sites (e.g., prisons and closed settings). Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR - testing was the most recommended surveillance method, followed by genomic screening, serosurveillance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. Only one document (published by Public Health England) was identified that provided guida nce on surveillance specific to vaccinated populations . The document outlined a plan to surveil and monitor COVID -19 in vaccinated populations through a series of targeted longitudinal studies, routine surveillance, enhanced surveillance, use of electronic health records, surveillance of vaccine failure .

Conclusion: Evidence for post -vaccination COVID -19 sur veillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations. Population PCR screening, supplemented by rapid antigen tests, was the most frequently used surveillance method and also the most commonly recommended across jurisdictions. Th e selection of testing method and the frequency of testing was determined by the intensity of the disease and the scale of testing. Other common testing methods included wastewater surveillance and genomic surveillance. A few novel technologies are emergin g, however, many of these are yet to be utilized in the real -world setting. There is limited evidence -based guidance on surveillance in a vaccinated population. Most recent guidance on COVID -19 surveillance is not specific to vaccinated individuals, or it is in effect but has not yet been updated to reflect that. Therefore, more evidence -informed guidance on testing and surveillance approaches in a vaccinated population that incorporates all testing modalities is required.

As of June 2021, there have been more than 1 79,000,000 confirmed cases of COVID - 19, which have resulted in more than 3, 800,000 confirmed deaths worldwide .1 Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real -world observational studies have found vaccines to be safe and effective at preventing COVID -19.2 At the time of writing, more than 2,700,000 vaccine doses have been administered across the w orld, with several countries (e.g., Israel, the UK) approaching the 70% benchmark of having their population fully vaccinated with the goal of reaching herd immunity.1,3 As the number of partially and fully vaccinated people continues to grow, countries may be pivoting their population -level surveillance methods to capture the presence and resurgence of COVID -19 and its variants of concern (VOCs). RT -PCR testing of nose and throat swabs is a widely used method to identify new cases of COVID -19; however, the ability of RT -PCR testing to slow viral spread may be impacted by slow laboratory turnaround times and restricted availability of the tests.4 As a result, there may be interest in alternative population -level testing modalities that can detect the presence and resurgence of the virus in a setting before an outbreak. This rapid review aims to answer the following research questions: 1. What scientific evidence exists on surveillance approaches to monitor the presence of the virus in a fully vaccinated population (i.e., monitoring for resurgence and variants of concern through wastewater surveillance and metagenomics, population screening with rapid antigen testing)? How does this influence testing strategies? a. What technologies are emerging to identify infection caused by variants of concern in a vaccinated population? 2. What international guidance exists on testing and surveillance for SARS -CoV-2 and its variants of concern in a fully vaccinated population? Recognizing that the evidence on surveillance in fully vac cinated populations may be limited, this review also includes literature assessing surveillance broadly in a partially vaccinated population to ensure that all relevant literature is captured. .

An experienced medical information specialist developed and tested the search strategies throug h an iterative process in consultation with the review team. Another senior information specialist peer reviewed the MEDLINE strategy prior to execution using the PRESS Checklist .5 Using the multifile option and deduplication tool available on the OVID platform, we searched Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae, includi ng Epub Ahead of Print, In -Process Non -Indexed Citations, Embase, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We also searched the Web of Science Core Collection. We perfo rmed all searches on June 13, 2021. The strategies utilized a combination of controlled vocabulary (e.g., \"COVID -19\", Vocabulary and syntax were adjusted across the databases (full search strategies included in Appendix A). No language restrictions were applied but results were limited to the publication years 2020 to the present. Results were downloaded and deduplicated using EndNote version 9.3.3 (Clarivate Analytics) and uploaded to Microsoft Word. A grey literature search was also conducted, including: MedRxiv, Google, McMaster Health Forum (CoVID -END), and websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Contr ol and Prevention [CDC ], World Health Organization [WHO ]). This search was limited to studies conducted since December 2020 and current to June 13th, 2021. There were no language limitations. A screening form based on the eligibility criteria was prepared . Citations identified as potentially relevant from the literature search were screened by single reviewer across a team of four reviewers and subsequently read in full text by two reviewers and assessed for eligibility based on the criteria outlined below (Table 1). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched to ensure all relev ant literature is captured. Table 1. Criteria for Inclusion of Scientific Evidence on Surveillance Population Persons who have been partially or fully vaccinated against COVID -19; populations in settings with a high vaccination rate/low prevalence rate of COVID -19 and low vaccination rate/low prevalence rate of COVID -19 were also considered .

All reviewers completed a calibration exercise whereby data from two sample studies were ext racted by all four reviewers and areas of disagreement were discussed. Data were extracted by one reviewer. Given the rapid nature of this request, a formal risk of bias assessment was not conducted. A high -level discussion of quality of the evidence (i.e. , peer -reviewed vs. preprints) is included below. Due to the heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes across included studies, data were synthesized narratively; a meta -analysis was not conducted. A high -level summary of the different surveillance methods, populations assessed by the methods, and outcomes is presented in the next section. A patient partner was engaged during the co -production of a plain language summary, which is presented in a separate document. Results A total of 1197 articles wer e identified from database search. After removing duplicates, 914 unique citations were included ; 90 of which were assessed in full text articles . Thirty -three studies were included for data synthesis (Figure 1). All the studies were published between April and June 2021. Thirteen were national studies ; there were seven regional and city -wide studies each ; five were single -centre studies (e.g., hospitals and long-term care facilities [LTCFs ]); and one was an international study. Sixteen studies were conducted in the USA, four were from England , three each from Israel and Spain , two from Italy , and one study from each of the following: the UK, Canada, India, Indonesia , and Uruguay. The majority of the studies (n=21) were from peer -reviewed journals (Table 2). .

The majority of these studies were in healthcare settings (10 studies), seven were in LTCFs , and two in the community. In two studies, surveillance was conducted among healthcare and essential workers , while another two studies involved LTCFs and the community (Table 2). Healthcare Setting The studies involving healthcare workers ( HCWs ) were mostly conducted at single hospitals (7 studies) ; while t wo studies were national ,6,7 and one was a regio nal study .8 In some studies, routine post -exposure screening of symptomatic or asymptomatic HCWs using RT -PCR based testing of samples obtained from nasal or oropharyngeal swabs were implemented ;9-12 while some o ther studies implemented periodic (typically weekly) asymptomatic screenings.6,13-15 Although the majority of the surveillance involving HCWs utilized only RT -PCR testing, two studies used a combination of RT -PCR and rapid antigen testing. One was a biweekly national s urveillance study of HCWs in England ,7 and the other was at a single hospital in India.16 Seven of the hospital -based studies also implemented genetic sequencing to identify variants following a positive RT -PCR test. All the studies identified breakthrough cases among vaccinated individuals, some sequenced for VOCs, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccinat ion against infections. Long Term Care Facilities There were four national LTCFs studies,17-20 two regional studies21,22 and one city -wide study.23 Five of the seven LTCF surveillance studies utilized RT -PCR and or rapid antigen testing.18,20 -23 The frequency of testing appeared to vary depending on whether there was an outbreak. In one study involving LTCFs in Catalonia, Spain, the public health guidelines required routine two-to-four weekly screening of residents and staff with RT -PCR or antigen tests,21 another study reported two weekly screening s in the absence of an outb reak with an additional daily rapid antigen testing (with confirmatory RT-PCR for positive tests) during an outbreak.22 Other studies reported a more frequent screening schedule varying between five-to-seven days during an outbreak.18,19 Of note, one national USA study reported that the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid services required all nursing homes in the same county to test all their staff and residents at the same frequency based on the county COVID -19 rate.17 A number of the L TCF studies conducted genetic sequencing to identify variants.19,22 Although breakthrough cases were found among vaccinated individuals, the studi es generally demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccination in the prevention of infection.

From this study, it was observed that 92.3% of infections in England at the time were from the B.1.1.7 lineage and 7.7% from the B.1.617.2 lineage.24 The Israeli national study conducted surveillance in LTCFs and the community (using samples from random drive -through testing centres )26 and showed that the B.1.1.7 variant was 45% more transmissible than the wild -type strain in Israel. These studies identified COVID -19 cases among vaccinated individuals, and also determined the prevalence and transmiss ibility of variants. Implementation Considerations and Limitations of Population Surveillance The following implementation considerations for and limitations to population surveillance were identified in the reviewed studies : 1. For studies allowing discretionary access to testing, the frequency of testing tend s to be highly variable from person to person .12 2. Antigen tests have lower sensitivity , therefore some positive cases may be missed during asymptomatic screening.9 3. The timing of infection s relative to PCR testing and the sensitivity of the PCR test s can result in infections being missed during follow -up.7 4. While large sample sizes from multicentre studies increase generalizability, several s tudies observed that details of local variation in practices (in healthcare settings or long -term care facilities ) are lost when findings from different centres are pooled and analyzed together . Therefore , the findings of such studies may not be generaliza ble.19-21 For example, the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the USA required all nursing homes to test residents and staff at the same frequency dictated by the rate of COVID -19 in the community (not in the facility ).17 5. Teran et al noted that, with electronic databases, it was impossible to confirm whether patients with a breakthrough infection and a previous positive SARS -CoV-2 test result had a true reinfection or had prolonged shedding from the previous infection.23 6. In a study with prolonged follow up period, the authors observed a progressive decline in participants' interest.24 Genomic Surveillance Three genomic surveillance studies were identified in this review.27,28 Two were city -wide surveillance studies conducted in the USA ,27,29 and one was a national scale study conducted in Uruguay.28 All three were community -based studies.

In Spain,31 wastewater surveillance predicted major outbreaks by several weeks and showed good correlation with clinical data , providing informa tion at local level;30 while another study in the USA reported a rapid turnaround time (average of 1.6 days).32 The challenges observed included: inconsistencies in variant representation depending on where the samples were taken w ithin the community33 and differences in the capacity of wastewater to predict case numbers based on the size of the wastewater treatment plants.35 One study reported that laboratory build -out costs approximately $100,000 USD in capital equipment and took 3 months to complete.32 Testing Air Filters on Public Buses In one study , Hoffman et al. placed and retrieved filters in the existing air filtration systems o n public buses in Seattle to test for the presence of trapped SARS -CoV-2 RNA using phenol -chloroform extraction and RT -PCR. The study detected SARS -CoV-2 RNA i n 14% of public bus filters tested.36 Metagenomics Using the nextstra in.org database, Quinonez et al. were able to predict that the rate of B.1.1.7 lineage is going to sharply decrease (near to zero) in the coming months. The authors suggested a cautious generalizability because of the lack of validation of this approach in an experimental study.37 Emerging Technologies New surveillance technologies for COVID -19 are emerging and some of these have been validated, but not yet studied in a real -world setting. Examples include the use of wearable monitoring device to continuously monitor skin temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate for early detection of COVID -19 symptoms38 and the use of deep learning -based model to detect COVID -19 infection via CT sca ns and chest X -rays.39 A number of new assay methods ( Table 3) and novel sample collection methods were also identified in this review ; however, not all met inclusion criteria and were therefore not included in the broader synthesis . For example, Reeves et al. described a composite autosampler that withdraws samples from wastewater outfall within surface -accessible manholes that can be used to monitor and detect SARS -CoV-2 in individual buildings and communities.40 .

Domi et al.17 (USA) Peer -Reviewed Long Term Care/National In accordance with CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services) regulations, nursing homes in the same county were required to test all their staff and residents at the same frequency based on the county COVID -19 rate In this retrospective study, case s were assessed approximately two months into vaccination. The level of vaccination at these facilities was unclear. CMS required all nursing homes to test residents and staff at the same frequency dictated by the rate of COVID -19 in the community not in t he facility. Shrotri et al.19 (England) Preprint Long Term Care/National LTCF residents underwent monthly routine RT -PCR testing, and if an LTCF outbreak was suspected, local public health teams organised PCR testing for all residents upon notification and 7 days later. Individuals who tested positive were not re -tested for the following 90 days unless they developed new COVID -19 symptoms This prospective study analyzed cases of COVID -19 during the first three months of vaccine toll -out in the UK. A benefit of this study was access to high - quality routine data for a large, well -defined cohort of LTCF residents who were tested regularly for SARS - CoV-2 throughout follow -up.

The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)began matching records to Illinois' Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange to identify breakthrough infections. After ident ifying SARS -CoV-2 infection in a resident 16 days after receipt of a second vaccine dose, CDPH initiated an investigation to quantify breakthrough infections across all facilities. Confirming whether patients with a breakthrough infection and a previous positive SARS -CoV-2 test result had a true reinfection or represented persons with prolonged shedding from previous infection was not possible. Breakthrough infections might be underestimated because of data entry errors or delayed surveillance reporting.

The auth ors observed a decline in response rate compared with preceding rounds and there were concerns regarding the representativeness of the samples collected. Based on sequence data for positive samples for which a lineage could be identified, estimated that t hat 92.3% of infections were from the B.1.1.7 lineage and 7.7% from the B.1.617.2 lineage Munitz et al.26 (Israel) Peer -Reviewed Community and Long - Term Care/National Approximately 300,000 individual tests collected from Israeli nursing houses and from random \"Drive and Check\" SARSCoV -2 test complexes. Monitored the dyna mics of the spread of the B.1.1.7 SARS -CoV-2 variant in Israel, using samples collected two months into the vaccine roll -out. The study demonstrated that the B.1.1.7 variant was 45% more transmissible than the wild -type strain in Israel. Surveill ance Thompson et al.27 Peer -Reviewed Community/City All RT -PCR positive SARS -CoV-2 specimens, from 9 COVID express laboratories serving New York City, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value <32 underwent whole genome sequencing. Sequencing was done for samples collected during the first f our months of vaccination. The number of persons with reinfection or breakthrough infection whose specimens underwent whole genome sequencing was low, limiting the statistical power to detect modest increases in immune escape that could have a substantial impact on public health. Improved capacity for genomic surveillance, establishment of automated and efficient exchange of WGS data, and integration with population -based clinical and epidemiologic data would enable the rapid characterization of emerging SA RS-CoV-2 variants.

Sampling was carried out on 129 different days spanning from April 16, 2020, to March 9, 2021. Time series were similar for wastewaters data and declared cases, but wastewater RNA concentrations exhibited transient peaks that were not observed in declared cases and preceded major outbreaks by several weeks. B.1.1.7 identified. Fitzgerald et al.35 (UK) Peer -Reviewed Community/National Sites were sampled once a week for RT - PCR testing There were significant differences between wastewater treatment plants in their capacity to predict case numbers based on influent viral RNA load, with the limit of detection ranging from twenty - five cases for larger plants to a single case in smaller plants. Fuqua et al.33 (USA) Preprint Community/Regional RNA isolated from wastewater samples was used to quantify SARS -CoV-2 and analyze the genetic variation through high-throughput sequencing. Bioinformatics approaches were used to rapidly identify single nucleotide genetic alterations, which were compared with known variants of interest and concern. Differences in the scale of sample pooling in the community revealed unanticipated inconsistencies in variant representation. Variants observed in smaller catchment areas, such as neighbourhood manhole locations, were not observed in downstream treatment plants, suggesting catchment size or population could impact the ability to detect diversity.

Other approaches include: genomic surveillance, wastewater surveillance, metagenomics , and sampling of filters on public transport. The RT -PCR detects the RNA genome of SARS -CoV-2 and has been the mainstay of COVID -19 diagnosis.47 As observed in several studies in this review, rapid antigen testing was often used complementarily with RT -PCR and rarely alone as a surveillance tool. Th is test detects the presence of viral proteins,47 is easy to perform , and can be interpreted without spec ialized training or equipment, thus can be widely distributed with a rapid turnaround time between sampling and results. Rapid antigen tests have generally relatively lower sensitivit ies compared with RT -PCR.47-49 Consequently, the European Centres for Disease Control (ECDC) suggested a more nuanced approach to rapid antigen testing, suggesting that in a high prevalence setting, a positive result from a n antigen test is likely to indicate a true infection and may not require confirmation by RT -PCR;50 while any negative test result should be confirmed by RT -PCR immediately.50 Conversely, the ECDC suggests that in a low prevalence setting, rapid antigen tests should be able to rule out a highly infectious case ; as such, a negative test result may not require confirmation by RT -PCR, whereas a positive test will need immediate sampling for a confirmation by RT -PCR.50 Population -level tracking of the origin, distribution, and trends of Covid -19 is ch allenging, especially considering the rapidly evolving profile of the virus. Wastewater surveillance may provide a non -invasive, anonymous and scalable method of tracking the virus within the population , within a geographic area , at a point in time .51 However, challenges such as inconsistencies in variant representation,33 differences in the capacity of wastewater to predict cases35 and build -out cost32 were identified in this review . A limitation of this review is the lack of details on the methodological approaches to COVID -19 surveillance in the included studies . The majority of the studies were designed as epidemiological studies of existing surveillance programs, therefore, the authors focused on the prespecified study outcomes rather than the practicality of the surveillance programs. Although all the studies included vaccinated populations, there were variations in the reporting of vaccination rate. While some small hospital -based and LTCF studies reported institutional vaccinati on rates, several large studies did not. .

A grey literature search was conducted, including a thorough search of Google, websites of international government organizations (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], World Health Organization [WHO]), and McMaster Health Forum (C OVID-END). This search was primarily examining surveillance guidance published since December 2020 (to capture guidance specific to vaccinations); however, it was expanded to include guidance on surveillance programs that would have been established prior to December 2020 but were still in place. There were no language limitations. A screening form based on the eligibility criteria was prepared. Citations identified as potentially relevant from the literature search were screene d by single reviewer across a team of four reviewers and subsequently read in full text by two reviewers and assessed for eligibility based on the criteria outlined below (Table 4). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched to ensure all relevant literature is captured. Table 4: Criteria for Inclusion of International Guidance on Surveillance Population Persons who have been partially or fully vaccinated against COVID -19; populations in settings with a high vaccination rate/low prevalence rate of COVID -19 and low vacci nation rate/low prevalence rate of COVID -19 were also considered Intervention Surveillance approaches to monitor for resurgence of COVID -19 and variants of concern (e.g., wastewater surveillance and metagenomics, population screening with rapid antigen te sting) Outcome Any Guideline Body Guidance issued by international health organizations Publication Year Limited to publication date December 2020 -onwards ; ongoing surveillance programs established before December 2020 were considered for inclusion A standardized data extraction sheet was used to extract the month and year of publication, country, scope (e.g., national), surveillance method, vaccination status, population, setting, intended outcomes (e.g., variant surveillance) , platform used for surveillance (e.g., any database), guidance summary, and implementation considerations. All reviewers completed a calibration exercise whereby data from two sample studies were extracted by all four reviewers and areas of disagreement wer e discussed. Data were extracted by one reviewer. . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A patient partner was engaged during the co -production of a plain language summary, which is presented in a separate document. Results Through hand searching of grey literature, 68 guida nce documents were captured and screened for eligibility. After full -text review, a total of 42 guideline documents were excluded. The most common reason for exclusion was publication date prior to December 2020, without clear indication the surveillance m ethods were ongoing (n=18). Other reasons for exclusion were: not a guidance document (n=15), not surveillance method(s) (n=6), or duplicate (n=3). A total of 26 guidance documents were included in the synthesis ( Table 5); see Table 6 in Appendix B for a summary of the guidance provided across included d ocuments. Most were not specific to vaccinated populations but reported on a surveillance method of COVID -19 and were therefore included in the review ; it was assumed that they were still in effect but have not yet updated. .

The scope of the guidance documents was mostly national -focused (n=17), however there were some that were international - (n=6) and regional -focused (n=3). All of the guidance documents included surveillance methods conducive for community settings. Other settings of interest were healthcare setting including hospitals and primary care centres,55,63,65,68,70 long- term care facilities,63,65 points of entry for travel,68,70 schools,55 and other sentinel sites (e.g., prisons and closed settings).65,70 Seven overarching surveillance methods emerged in the literature. PCR -testing was the most recommended surveillance method (n=11), followed by genomic screening (n=9), serosurveillance (n=5), wastewater surveillance antigen testing screening (n=2), and syndro mic surveillance (n=2) ( Figure 3).

The Public Health England COVID -19 Vaccine Surveillance Strategy63 recommends surveillance methods including PCR -testing, health record screening, serosurveillance, and genome se quencing with the following objectives: To monitor coverage of the vaccine in targeted populations and identify under -vaccinated groups; to rapidly detect and evaluate possible adverse events associated with vaccination; to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine at preventing a spectrum of disease outcomes and onwards transmission in different targeted populations, and against different viral variants, as well as the duration of any protective effect; to identify risk factors for and outcomes of vacci ne failure, including any impact on strain evolution; to monitor the overall impact of the vaccination program on COVID -19 in the wider population including the indirect effect on groups not targeted by the vaccination program ; to monitor the impact of the vaccination program on prevalence of antibodies against COVID -19 as an indicator of population level immunity, and to monitor antibody waning in the population; to monitor attitudes to vaccination and identify barriers to high vaccine uptake, and; to monitor inequalities in each of these outcome measures. Discussion Comprehensive hand -searching for international guidance on surveillance methods of COVID -19 yielded 26 documents. Most were not specific to vaccinated populations but reported on a surveillance method of COVID -19 and were therefore included in the review; it was assumed that they were still in effect but have not yet been updated . Seven surveillance methods emerged from the guidance documents: PCR -testing, genomic s creening, serosurveillance, wastewater surveillance, antigen testing, health record screening, and syndromic surveillance. Many of the surveillance methods were recommended for use in community settings, however PCR -testing, antigen testing, genomic screen ing, serosurveillance, and health record screening were also recommended for targeted settings such as health care facilities, long -term care facilities, schools, and points of entry for travelers. The objectives of the surveillance methods were consisten t across countries. PCR -testing, antigen - testing, syndromic surveillance, health record screening, and serosurveillance should be used to: monitor the intensity, spread, and severity of COVID -19 in order to estimate the burden of disease, .

Additionally , genomic sequencing should be used to identify variations and evolution of SARS -CoV-2 to identify variants of concern. Wastewater surveillance should be used to compl ement other surveillance methods, to detect if COVID -19 and its variants are present in a community setting. Only one document (published by Public Health England) was identified that provided guidance specific to surveillance of vaccinated populations. Public Health England details their plan to surveil and monitor COVID -19 in vaccinated populations in the UK, including conducting cohort studies such as SIREN, VIVALDI, and CONSENSUS studies.63 These will involve routine surveillance, enhanced surveillance, use of electronic health records, surveillance of vaccine failure (including follow -up with viral whole genome sequencing) and sero -surveillance (including blood donor samples, routine blood tests, and residual sera). There are several limitations to this review . Given the rapid nature of this report and the evidence of interest (i.e., international guidance), we were unable to carry -out a n exhaustive systematic search of the literature. Therefore, the international guidance captured here may not include all countries '/institutes ' guidance for surveillance. Additionally, we were unable to address the quality of evidence reported in the guidance documents because of the variation in reporting and level of detail in the included documents. Conclusion s Evidence for post -vaccination COVID -19 surveillance was derived from studies in partially or fully vaccinated populations. Population PCR screening, supplemented by rapid antigen tests, was the most frequently used surveillance method and also the most commonly recommended across jurisdictions . The selection of testing method and the frequency of testing was determined by the intensity of the disease and the scale of testing. Other common testing methods included wastewater surve illance and genomic surveillance. A few novel technologies are emerging, however, many of these are yet to be utilized in the real -world setting. There is limited evidence -based guidance on surveillance in a vaccinated population. Most recent guidance on C OVID -19 surveillance is not specific to vaccinated individuals , or it is in effect but has not yet been updated to reflect that . Therefore, more evidence - informed guidance on testing and surveillance approaches in a vaccinated population that incorporates all testing modalities is required. .

January 2021 Europe ECDC67 Scope: International Setting: Community Level of Evidence: Evidence informed Genomic surveillance (Pre -screening RT -PCR before testing for emerging variants ) Stated reason for use: To detect introduction of known variants and control the spread and impact of emerging variants. Systematic sequencing of a representative or random selection of detected viruses, which should be coordinated regionally and nationally. Laboratories should consider implementing pre -screening RT -PCR approaches to detect N501Y or S -gene target failure (deletion 69 -70) variant viruses. All laboratories should be requested to report their results to the national public health inst itute that coordinates the collection of information. National public health authorities should notify cases of the variants of concern through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), and TESSy for case -based surveillance and aggregate reporting (whi ch has been adapted for this purpose). To be able to confirm infection with a specific variant, sequencing of the whole SARS -CoV-2 genome, or at least the S -gene for the current variants, is required. For the VOC 202012/01, a negative S -gene result in multiplex RT -PCR assays, with positive results for the other targets, has been used as an indicator or pre - screening method to identify the variant. However, it should be noted that this target failure is not exclusive to VOC 202012/01, and confirmation using sequencing is always recommended.

If the correlation is very high, S -gene target failure can be used to approximate the frequency of VOC 202012/01. A minimum ability to roug hly quantify the proportion of a variant present at a prevalence of 2.5% of the total circulating variants is recommended. This requires each country to sequence at least around 500 randomly selected samples each week. Sequencing of samples from large outbreaks and samples connected to travelers (either from point of entry screening or outbreaks involving a traveler ) should be prioritized . Sequencing should be prioritized for individuals who present with a 'breakthrough infection' identified >14 days after receiving the first dose of COVID -19 vaccine (see section on Vaccination). Viral isol ation of variants of SARS -CoV-2 should be carried out in P3 (Biosafety level (BSL) laboratories to prevent the accidental dissemination of a variant through laboratory exposure. In general, laboratory preparedness should be among the current high priorities, and laboratories should: 1) consider implementing diagnostic pre -screening for variants of concern (e.g. N50 1Y and deletion 69 -70); 2) ensure human and material resources are available to manage an increasing number of requests for detection and characterization of SARS -CoV-2 samples; 3) increase sequencing capacity by making use of all possible sequencing capac ity in the Member States .

This is particularly t rue for asymptomatic cases with a known history of exposure. In any high -risk settings with vulnerable populations only RT -PCR should be used,unless RT -PCR capacity is limited. In vulnerable populations with symptoms, multiplex RT -PCR would be best suited for confirmation to exclude symptoms caused by other respiratory pathogens. In a low prevalence setting, rapid antigen tests will have a high NPV but a low PPV. Therefore, if used correctly, rapid antigen tests should be able to rule out a highly infectious case in such a setting. A negative test result may not require confirmation by RT -PCR, whereas a positive test will need immediate sampling for a confirmation by RT -PCR. Recurring testing b y rapid antigen test every 2 -3 days with the aim to identify infectious cases in a population can partly mitigate the lower sensitivity of the test and can be used in certain settings such as in staff of health care settings. In low prevalence settings, su fficient RT -PCR and logistics capacity will probably be in place to ensure a rapid turnaround of results. However, there could still be an added value to the use of rapid antigen tests because of the low cost and rapid turnaround time of analysis. Here, a careful cost -benefit calculation has to .

COVID -NET is CDC's source for important data, and provides important clinical information on COVID -19-associated hospitalizations, including age group, sex, race/ethnicity and underlying health conditions. COVID -NET is a population -based s urveillance system meant to collect, analyze , and interpret data regarding lab-confirmed Covid -19-associated hospitalizations among children and adults. Cases are identified in COVID -Net if they test positive through a test ordered by a health care profess ional and are hospitalized within 14 days of the positive test. Clinical data collected using a standardized case reporting form by trained surveillance officers, so the data are in a standardized and uniform way. COVID -Net comprises of 99 counties in 14 s tates (10% of the population).

Sentinel syndromic surveillance: should integrate COVID -19 surveillanc e with sentinel surveillance of influenza -like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI), which is in place in most EU/EEA Member States. The naso -pharyngeal swabs obtained by sentinel physicians from a systematic sample of patients presenting wit h ILI/ARI should also be tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV- 2) in addition to influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In countries where sentinel physicians are not able to swab their patients, other approaches can be considered, such as self -swabbing and shipping of specimens using dedicated channels. Helplines, surveys, participatory surveillance. Countries not systematically testing most suspected cases while limiting physical access to primary healthcare (for example by encouraging people to call specific COVID - 19 helplines, or when people are placed in in lockdown) should consider analysing data from alternative sources. These could include phone consultations of sentinel physicians, calls to regional/national he althcare telephone helplines, consultations of online healthcare apps or self -assessment tools for advice on COVID -19 testing, or population -based participatory syndromic surveillance schemes for influenza that exist in a number of Member States. Resources permitting, countries can also conduct their own regular telephone surveys. .

Representative stains of virus from different geographic locations and time points, as well as from patients of both genders, and across the age and severity spectrum should be selected for sequencing in order to monitor virus evolution and changes in the virus genome. Comprehensive surveillance. Countries comprehensively testing suspected cases for COVID -19 should monitor the number and proportion of hospitalized cases, cases admitted to intensive care units (ICU) or high -dependency units (HDU), and cases with fatal outcome among the number of confirmed cases. Hospital -based SARI surveillance. Countries no longer testing mild suspected cases for COVID -19 should at least test all severe acute respiratory infect ion (SARI) cases admitted to hospital and ICU/HDU, and monitor the proportion of confirmed COVID -19 cases among all SARI. This type of surveillance system can be comprehensive or based on a number of representative sentinel hospitals or areas. Sentinel hos pitals should be selected if their catchment population is known and stable. A suitable alternative is to select all hospitals in a given area/region and use the population of that area/region as denominator. Mortality surveillance .

Date not reported New Zealand Ministry of Health 78 Scope: National Setting: Community Level of Evidence: Unclear Wastewater surveillance Stated reason for use: Wastewater testing is being used as an extra tool to help monitor for COVID -19. Wastewater testing may be able to give us an early warning of COVID -19 cases in the community. This will help to alert local communities to be more vigilant, keep up hygiene measures, and get tested and stay home if they are unwell. Wastewater is collected from sites that contain a mixture of the wastewater from the toilets, sinks and drains of hundreds of thousands of people in a community. Wastewater is being sampled at least once a week from many sites around the country and the Institute of Environmenta l Research and Science (ESR) tests these samples at their lab to determine if they can detect the virus . .
