Skin Care: The Weleda Accredited Holistic Esthetician Directory CONTENTS The world of Weleda, at a glance 2 3 = Event Gift See page 129 for more information about our Weleda wellbeing eventsEG V = Vegetarian Ve = Vegan and VegetarianG = Contains Gluten D = Not suitable for diabeticsWe start with soil and how we grow our plants, following a regenerative organic practice known as 'biodynamic agriculture'. Through this we don't just nurture the plant but care for all biodiversity, from the soil through to the rich bio-culture of species, growing certified organic ingredients, full of vitality. Alongside this unique philosophy, what makes Weleda different is our ownership. We are still owned by the not-for-profit foundations of our founders, ensuring our purpose is authentic and truly lived. We see Weleda not just as a place for work but for human development - where we work at eye level with our co-workers, suppliers, and customers, in partnership. From creating honest, fair, and transparent relationships with our customers, partners, and suppliers through to embracing personal responsibility and accountability for our work. It is these values which enable us to create a sustainable, long-term future for Weleda through ethical, value-creating practices, where profit is the result but not the goal. When we're formulating products - whether creating pampering skincare, protective baby care or holistic medicines - rather than just creating a superficial quick fix, Weleda products are formulated to support the body's own healing process. We even created a whole book about it and are sharing some insights from 'Natural Wellness Every Day: The Weleda Way' throughout this catalogue, which we hope you'll enjoy and want to come back to, again and again. Our purpose is to help you connect with your own health through our products to help bring natural balance to your everyday life and to support you in finding your own level of wellness. Weleda is a place where working 'in harmony with nature and the human being' is much more than a catchphrase - it's our purpose which we have honoured since the founding of our company, over 100 years ago.At Weleda, we have followed a holistic approach for the past one hundred years. It underpins all we do, from how we grow our plants through to running our business. This philosophy has deep roots - from our understanding of the human being, our link with the Earth and how we are connected to the cosmos.A word from Jayn Jayn Sterland, Managing Director, Weleda UK 4 5\"Weleda is a trusted and much-loved brand in our family . From my father to my youngest \"Weleda is a trusted and much-loved brand in our family . From my father to my youngest child, we rely on its quality in all areas of wellbeing, ethical values and most importantly child, we rely on its quality in all areas of wellbeing, ethical values and most importantly relaxation. I am a long-standing devotee of Weleda both in my personal and professional life, relaxation. I am a long-standing devotee of Weleda both in my personal and professional life, and I defy anyone else to match their all-round goodness.\"and I defy anyone else to match their all-round goodness.\" Erin O'Connor, MBEErin O'Connor, MBE Model and fashion ambassadorNatural pioneers for over a century - this is the Weleda way Weleda is a purpose-led business and has been since 1921. For over one hundred years we have built the path that many others have followed - creating natural, organic, life-enhancing products to \"support the unfolding of health and beauty in the individual, through working in harmony with nature and the human being\". It all began with a hospital and a pharmaceutical laboratory - founded by the Dutch doctor Ita Wegman, the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner and Oskar Schmiedel, a chemist and pharmacist from Munich. Now it has become the world's leading manufacturer of certified natural and organic cosmetics, and holistic health products: Weleda. Today, Weleda is sold in over 50 countries on five continents. Weleda produces hundreds of natural cosmetics and thousands of pharmaceuticals, many still made with medicinal plants grown in our own gardens. Responsible and ethical dealings with both nature and people have always formed part of our business, ever since Rudolf Steiner articulated his vision of a company completely at the service of human beings and the world as a whole. Whether it's through fair trade, biodynamic cultivation or the supportive development of our employees - sustainability is part of our roots. Leading the Way 6 7 Ethical TrailblaizerRight from our beginnings we've always chosen to grow our own plant ingredients using biodynamic methods. Weleda has seven medicinal plant gardens worldwide, where we farm over 250sq kilometres of land biodynamically, and over 50 long term partnerships with growers who use regenerative agricultural methods like biodynamics and organics. Weleda provides advice, expertise and the guarantee of a regular and fair income for all of our long-term projects, and in return Weleda is assured the finest quality ingredients at a fair price that ensures our products remain affordable for our customers. Traditional farming methods are preserved for local communities, sustainable practices are nurtured, and the landscape is protected from potentially destructive large scale development. The partnership We are Nature Planet, plants, people flourishes on a shared philosophy of sustainable development and environmental protection. Biodynamic growers always aim to promote and increase biodiversity, ensuring that we're giving more back to nature than we're taking out as raw materials. We consciously cultivate for wildlife's needs not just our own, so we grow lots of flowers just for the pollinators, feed the micro-organisms in our soils with biodynamic compost and provide plenty of different habitats and hiding places to encourage the rich tapestry of life into the garden. This helps us grow the best quality ingredients for our products and ensures that we're always working with genuine care and deep respect for our growers and the Earth we have just temporary custodianship of. 8 9 BEST ORGANIC BRANDB-Corp B Corp certification is awarded by the non-profit organisation B Lab. It is not products that are certified, but a company's actions and overall approach. The focus is on social added value and ecological sustainability, and not maximising profits at any price. In other words, it is about the environment, biodiversity, species protection, human rights, climate protection, employees and customers. B Lab calls it 'business as a force for good'. Zero Plastic Inside This certification, provided by the Plastic Soup Foundation, can only be awarded to brands and companies that do not use microplastic ingredients in their products. This includes liquid polymers which are still commonly found in many cosmetics, not just plastic microbeads. Demeter Certified Weleda UK is the proud owner and careful custodian of 13 acres of Demeter- certified organic land just a couple of miles up the road from our Head Office in Derbyshire. Here we ensure the eco-system is balanced, growing to biodynamic standards to ensure no pesticides or artificial fertilisers are ever used. The land is managed sensitively and we've developed different habitats such as a pond, woodland, meadows and hedgerows, which help to sustain a rich and diverse population of insects, birds and animals. Weleda's 7 other medicinal plant gardens worldwide are Demeter-certified. Living Wage Weleda UK has recently been accredited as a Living Wage Employer by the Living Wage Foundation. The Living Wage Foundation is an organisation at the heart of the independent movement of businesses and people that campaign for the idea that a hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay, recognising responsible employers who choose to pay a real Living Wage based on the cost of living, not just the government minimum. Sustainable Beauty Coalition The Sustainable Beauty Coalition formed by The British Beauty Council champions a beauty industry whereby all practices are sustainable, ethical and profitable. Weleda UK Managing Director Jayn Sterland is SBC Chair and her work as a lifelong environmentalist feeds directly into Weleda's own green policies and practices. B Corp Beauty Coalition The new B Corp Beauty Coalition brings together over 35 leading cosmetics firms from all around the globe, to improve sustainability standards in the beauty industry. Its mission is to improve the social and environmental impacts of business practices in the beauty industry, through knowledge sharing and responsible innovation, with consistent and transparent communication. Through solid engagement, collaboration and coalition, they seek to improve social and environmental conditions along the supply chain, from raw materials to the finished product. Jayn Sterland, managing director of Weleda UK, represents Weleda in the Beauty Coalition as a board member. 10 11 UEBT Certified: Sourcing with respect The Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) is a non-profit organisation that provides a globally recognised standard for the ethical sourcing of natural ingredients. It guarantees that biodiversity is conserved and used sustainably in the cultivation, harvesting and processing of raw materials. It also ensures that all our partners along the supply chain are treated equitably and paid fairly. Weleda is one of just two beauty brands worldwide to have achieved this certification to date. NATRUE Certification The NATRUE seal on all of Weleda's natural and organic cosmetics guarantees the highest standards of naturalness. The global seal identifies products you can trust to contain truly natural and organic ingredients, free from synthetic ingredients, silicones and mineral oils, GMO ingredients, artificial additives of any kind. It's also your reassurance that the product is cruelty free, because the NATRUE seal is not permitted on cosmetics that have been tested on animals.Increasingly often in the beauty industry it can be hard to identify which products are genuinely sustainable, natural or organic. The cosmetics market is flooded with 'nature inspired' products that, in truth, have very little natural goodness in them and do even less good for the planet. In an ocean of greenwash, how can we be sure that the products we buy are the real deal? At Weleda we adopt only the gold standards of ethical and sustainable practices, setting new benchmarks and driving the change within the beauty and health sectors. Our certifications are independently awarded, globally recognised and rigorously verified.Our Sustainability Standards Sustainable since day one \"Animal testing is fundamentally against NATRUE's underlying values \"Animal testing is fundamentally against NATRUE's underlying values and ethics; a principle that is embedded in the NATRUE standard\"and ethics; a principle that is embedded in the NATRUE standard\" Dr Mark Smith, Director General, NATRUEWhat you can do to get involved We are partnering with environmental activist Arizona Muse and her soil regeneration charity DIRT, to promote regenerative farming practices such as biodynamic growing, and to campaign for soil health. We want to encourage everyone to think about the earth under our feet. We'll be celebrating Earth Day in April by donating 5% of all sales made over that weekend to DIRT, both from our own store and from participating retailers. The theme for Earth Day this year is 'Invest In our Planet'. The donation period will run from midnight on Friday 21 April through to midnight on Sunday 23 April 2023. We see this initiative as our partnership with the planet. Start making greener beauty choices which will positively impact the planet. Download the Planet Positive Beauty Guide for dozens of practical ways to Save Earth's Skin - simply scan the QR code for your free copy. Look for soil friendly certifications and verified third party standards that have independent testing measures to make sure a product is really delivering against its claims. Be mindful of what you eat - organic and biodynamic food and drink was produced without chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilisers. Choose peat-free compost for your garden, balcony, indoor plants, or local urban garden project. Better still, make your own. Whether in your own garden or community plot, it's time to get your hands dirty! Planting herbs, flowers, vegetables, shrubs and trees all helps to prevent soil erosion and increase biodiversity. Our long-standing commitment to soil wouldn't be possible without your support. #SaveEarthsSkin #EarthDay Soil is the skin of our Earth - a rich, crucial, living biome. A healthy soil supports healthy life. But our soil is under threat - from deforestation, soil erosion, and surface sealing with concrete buildings and roads. Soil erosion alone accounts for over 24 billion tonnes of soil being lost each year. A third of the Earth's soil is degraded, resulting in poor soil quality and diminished biodiversity within the soil. Soil, just like our skin, has a microbiome - it's a living, breathing eco- system. A teaspoon of soil contains billions of microorganisms and tiny creatures that help make the soil fertile, enhancing plant health and enabling soil to store carbon and water. We need healthy, fertile land in order to grow nutritious food, harvest natural resources, sequester carbon and reduce emissions. Together, we can tackle the crisis facing our soil. Even if we take small steps, collectively it could make a big difference - from choosing soil friendly beauty products with ingredients grown using regenerative farming practices, to growing your own plants and composting - we can help protect and nourish the soil. Our Save Earth's Skin campaign committed financial support to numerous soil-focused projects across the globe - twenty different international soil projects were supported. In the UK we teamed up with environmental charity TreeSisters, because planting trees is a great way to protect soil from erosion. With your help, over 200,000 trees have been planted around the world where they are most needed, to protect precious natural habitats and endangered rainforests. For 2023 Weleda plans to contribute \u20ac200,000 for new regenerative cultivation projects, plus personnel support for those projects from our experienced international strategic sourcing team. THE EARTH'S SKIN NEEDS CARE, JUST LIKE OURS 12 13Soil contains 25% of all life on Earth and stores three times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere Soil is being destroyed 10 times faster than it is being created One cubic metre of healthy soil is home to over 5,000 billion living organisms 31 percent of greenhouse gas emissions can be directly linked to agriculture and land use change (IPCC) With over 20 years experience as a holistic facialist and highly qualified in several complementary therapies, Elizabeth joined Weleda to help share and support the Weleda Skincare Philosophy, as well as creating a Weleda accredited holistic esthetician course. She specialises in the anthroposophic approach to beauty - working in harmony with nature and the human being. Your Skin Not sure which products are right for you?

Our skin is also a mirror , a personal expression of ourselves - changeable, intuitive and responsive. When we are well and in harmony within and between our inner and outer worlds, our skin is healthy , radiant and glowing. When we are out of balance, unwell, stressed or struggling with hormonal or digestive issues, our skin reflects this too.\" Elizabeth King, Weleda Skin Care ExpertWeleda Skin Care Philosophy We are all individual and our skin needs different products at different times of life. Rather than a skin 'type', we should consider our skin 'phase', which is influenced by our age, our health and environment. Using our unique Lead Plant Philosophy we have created a range of holistic natural products that are responsive, protective and supportive - that work with your unique skin and its changing needs. Iris for balance: using active ingredients from biodynamic orris root, Iris helps to regulate and balance, making it ideal for younger, fluctuating, hormonal skin. Wild Rose for first signs of ageing: the precious Rosa Moschata oil's active ingredients strengthen and support the skin's structure, helping it retain moisture and treating the first signs of fine lines. Pomegranate for renewal: the antioxidant-rich active ingredients of pomegranate seed oil are found in our skin-firming range for skin that is maturing more visibly, to support cell renewal and regeneration. Evening Primrose for revitalising: the active ingredients of the evening primrose stabilise and strengthen mature and post-menopausal skin, helping it find its bloom and radiance. Almond for sensitive skin: rich in oleic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids, almond oil is wonderfully soothing and calming, making this fragrance-free range ideal for delicate, dry, reactive skin. Willow Bark for purifying: a combination of soothing natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory plant extracts, and the Aknedoron Purifying range is ideal for skin prone to congestion, blemishes and acne, during our teens or beyond. 16 P22 Skin Food Naturally Nourishing Facial Care P26 Cleansing Cleanse and tone gently but thoroughly P28 Willow Bark Purifying Facial Care Purifies, calms and re-balances congested and acne prone skin P30 Almond Sensitive Facial Care Fragrance-free skin care to soothe, comfort and protect P32 Iris Balancing Facial Care Regulates and preserves moisture balance P34 Wild Rose Smoothing Facial Care Softens and smooths fine linesP36 Pomegranate Firming Facial Care Promotes regeneration, firms and tightens P38 Your Weekly Mini Eye Care Routine P40 Evening Primrose Revitalising Facial Care Enhances skin's vitality and radiance, and deeply nourishes P42 Skin Care for Men Soothing Men's Facial Care Leaves skin smooth, supple and toned P44 The Weleda Accredited Holistic Esthetician Directory Weleda Skin Care at a glance Like us on Facebook to get more skin care tips throughout the season Weleda @WeledaUK 17 18 19Your 28 day skin cycle How to support the skin phase you're in At Weleda, we believe that your daily skincare routine should provide the best possible support for your skin's current phase. It should all make sense to you, be easy to follow and feel both purposeful and pleasurable. Avoid constantly chopping and changing your preparations. Consider your skin's phase as a journey - if you keep swapping products over the course of a few days, not only will your skin become confused, but you are unlikely to see positive results (and will find yourself with a cupboard full of half-used bottles). Instead work with your skin's own natural 28-day renewal period - also called our inner-moon rhythm - and try to commit to a 28-day process with your chosen skincare. You should begin to notice a change to how your skin looks and feels soon after you start using Weleda skincare, but avoid becoming too absorbed with the daily changes of your skin as this can sometimes be more disruptive than helpful. Instead, care consciously for your skin while at the same time taking a step back, trusting that the natural preparations are supporting the skin to regain its capacity to self-regulate. Divide your 28-day process into four weeks, and journal skin changes every seven days. This allows space for both the skin's processes to come into effect, and also gives you time to reflect. You may begin to notice how the skin's self-regulatory capacity increases as each week progresses. Perhaps this offers you an invitation too - to reflect on how you are feeling in relation to your skin, as well as on your inner wellbeing and relationship to the outer environment. You could also use this time as an opportunity to implement some positive lifestyle changes, such as addressing your sleeping patterns, beginning some gentle daily exercise or beginning to eat in a more seasonal way.

At Beauty Bible, we're known for putting products through their paces with real women, soliciting in-depth feedback after real-life use of products - so we were delighted to be asked to trial this trio of new products with a panel of 30 women, aged 25-30, who identified as having dry to very dry skin. The results for the Nourishing Cleansing Balm, Nourishing Day Cream and Nourishing Night Cream were truly outstanding and impressive. With the Nourishing Cleansing Balm , testers agreed that it not only cleansed dirt, impurities and make-up superbly, but left skin looking and feeling replenished. Three-quarters of these women would buy the product, after the trial. Nourishing Day Cream truly delivered on its promise to moisturise and hydrate, with almost nine out of 10 testers reporting that their skin looked and felt healthier and in better condition, after the trial, and the same number feeding back that they'd buy the product. (Since our trial coincided with a seriously cold spell in winter, when many of us resorted to turning the thermostat up higher on our central heating, Beauty Bible's even more impressed by this performance.) 90% of the testers reported that after 28 nights' use of Nourishing Night Cream , their skin had recovered from dryness and dullness - 'soothed, rested and radiant, all at once' was a typical comment, with so, so many testers feeding back on the comfort and softness delivered from first use by this rich but swiftly-absorbed cream. Four out of five would buy it again - again, a fantastic result, and most definitely not something we see with every trial. The Beauty Bible team is just delighted that Weleda - the original 'green beauty brand', with sustainability woven into its DNA since it first debuted in 1921 - will be offering these effective natural solutions for thirsty, dull skins. Antioxidant-rich and powerfully skin-quenching, we've really seen that these products deliver immediate, long-lasting moisture - yet are gentle. Dry skin often equals sensitive skin, but as we saw in the trials, all three products were also extremely widely tolerated. From our perspective, this is more proof that natural cosmetics can perform just brilliantly, with no compromises in performance. And that matters: our readers are more concerned than ever about the ethical, sustainability (and especially cruelty-free) credentials for their products, and increasingly understand and seek out B Corp certification, which Weleda has jumped through the many hoops required, to achieve! As a result of this fantastic performance in our real-life, in-depth trials, the range qualifies for our special 'Beauty Bible Approved' logo - because these real-life testers really did approve of the range. Weleda achieved B Corp certification in 2021, our centennial year. But what does it actually mean to be a B Corp business? Certification is awarded to companies that do business in a meaningful way. The focus is on social added value and ecological sustainability - the environment, species protection, human rights, climate protection, employees, and customers. B Corp stands for 'business as a force for good', and not maximising profits at any price. This is the underlying vision of B Lab. Founded in 2006 this non-profit organisation certifies for-profit companies as B Corporations - B Corps for short. The 'B' stands for beneficial: the benefit to society and the environment these businesses are providing. Today the global B Corp community is working together to make the planet a better place. How are we doing this? By putting business practices to the test. Companies must undergo a rigorous certification process according to strict criteria: What values do we live by in terms of our management style? What rights do our employees have? What is our impact on the environment, society and customers? A company with certified B Corp status means that it meets the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, balancing profit and purpose. Today there are over 6,000 certified B Corporations worldwide, in more than 80 countries, and over 150 different industries. B Corporations are committed to a long-term process of continuous improvement: every three years they must re-certify and meet increasingly ambitious standards. The aim is to do more good for people and the environment through exemplary business practices. An instant hit with Beauty Bible testers!

The Weleda Aknedoron Purifying range takes a gentle yet effective approach for a visibly clearer complexion, without drying or irritating the skin. * https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/acne-vulgaris/background-information/ prevalence/Purifying Plant Story: Willow Bark Weleda's willow bark extract is sourced from organic farming partners in Germany from four species of willow. A natural antimicrobial with soothing properties, willow bark contains salicin, a natural anti- inflammatory compound. Willow is also rich in polyphenols including flavonoids, which contribute antioxidant benefits to help repair skin damage.Healthy ways to support and rebalance oily skin When looking for a cleanser for oily skin, choose one that is 100% natural. Ensure that your cleanser does not leave your skin feeling tight and 'squeaky clean' (this is never a good thing - skin should not squeak!), but instead feels calm, comfortable and clear. Facial compresses can help rebalance sebum production. Try a sprig of sage or thyme, with lavender or chamomile - add to 500ml of hot water and let infuse for 15 minutes. Then soak a clean cloth in the cooled liquid and apply to face for a balancing post-cleanse treatment. Do not squeeze your spots or blackheads. Instead give yourself a herbal facial steam 1-2 times weekly to support the skin's own ability to cleanse, clear and then heal. If you feel critical of your skin and find it hard to resist fiddling, try dimming the bathroom lights when cleansing and applying your skincare; alternatively, you could cover your mirror or close your eyes and focus on treating your skin gently and intuitively. This is also a great opportunity to awaken your other senses - sense of touch and listening to your skin.

With organic sweet almond oil, dry and irritated skin is supported in its return to supple comfort. Fragrance-free and hypoallergenic.Sensitive Plant Story: Sweet Almond Much of Weleda's almond oil is cold-pressed from precious organic crops grown in Spain by our long-term partners, a cooperative of farmers passionate about organics, from orchards sprawling over 100,000 acres of the Valencian countryside. It takes over 2kg of almonds to produce 1kg of precious oil. Containing omega 6 and 9 fatty acids, sweet almond oil is highly effective in protecting skin against moisture loss, and strengthens the skin's own natural barrier.Restoring rhythm to sensitive skin With sensitive skin it is important to realise that something is out of balance. And, like a sensitive soul, the skin can only begin to restore itself when it feels safe and protected. Alternate warm and cool compresses. One warm skin compress held for several seconds followed with a cool facial rinse will help the skin to build natural resilience. Build this into your skincare routine 2-3 times weekly. Create just enough warmth and cool to create the necessary contrast between the two temperatures. If your skin is hyper-sensitive consider applying a few drops of Almond Sensitive Facial Oil to your face before getting into the shower or bath. The oil will act as a natural impermeable barrier to the water, which will help to keep it calm while you bathe.

Makeup designer James SpinksEG EG EG EGBalancing 32 33Bringing balance to skin in your twenties The years between the age of 21-28 can often be associated with many activities such as travelling, studying, socialising and starting a career. It can certainly be a busy life phase with lots of variety. This variety and its subsequent frequent environmental changes can be reflected in the skin. The first self-regulating process that begins to slow down is the skin's ability to bind and store water. For this reason, it is helpful in our mid-twenties to look for hydrating products that help balance oil levels while also boosting moisture. A combination of Hydrating Facial Mist followed by Iris Day and Night Cream will help skin do just that. Plant Story: Iris The iris thrives in inaccessible regions of Morocco's Atlas Mountains, where we work with an organic cooperative comprised of around 300 farming families and source our essential oil of orris. We also source iris extract from long-term farming partners at Casa Dei Fiori - a small cooperative of Demeter-certified biodynamic producers in Tuscany, Italy. The iris was named after the Greek rainbow-goddess of the same name - bringer of water and messenger of the gods. The striking rainbow flowers and the plant's ability to store water for long periods in fleshy roots confirm its connection with its mythological namesake.In our twenties - often a busy time of great change and development - the natural balance of our skin can be disrupted. Iris, with its reliable ability to bloom under pressure, regulating moisture and vital energy, makes it ideal for this stage of life. We combine balancing iris with soothing calendula, purifying witch hazel and gentle, nourishing oils of jojoba and sweet almond, to take care of skin that needs to re-establish its happy balance.IRIS.

It needs intensive nourishment and gentle smoothing to retain its youthful resilience, radiance and elasticity. Rosehip seed oil is perfect for skin during this phase of life. Proven to renew elasticity and intensively moisturise, this rich, golden oil strengthens the skin's resilience to environmental factors, while reducing the visibility of fine lines. WILD ROSE. SMOOTHING Plant Story: Rose Our organic Rosa Moschata or 'musk rose' seed oil is obtained from rosehips that grow wild, without chemical fertilisers and sprays, gathered by certified wild collection. The rosehips contain seeds from which the valuable oil is extracted. For a long time, the seeds were seen as waste products - their high nutritional value only discovered at the end of the 1990s. Weleda's oil is pressed from the ripe hips of bushes that grow abundantly at the foot of the Andes where environmental pollution is minimal, the hedges a welcome source of income for the Araucanians and Mapuche, the indigenous inhabitants of Chile. The virgin oil is rich in essential fatty acids that play a crucial part in skin regeneration, improving elasticity and hydration.Bringing resilience to skin in your thirties Our thirties can often be a time when we struggle with balancing home and work life - responsibilities mount, free time seems to diminish, and perhaps we find that we feel more in service to others than to ourselves. This can show in our expression lines. Plant ingredients rich in antioxidants are particularly helpful during this biographical phase. Wild rosehip seed oil, known for its ability to adapt and survive extreme weather conditions, is very high in antioxidants and can be really helpful in improving the skin's resilience and elasticity. The skin around our eyes is also very delicate, thinner than the rest of the face. This means it is the first area to show the signs of ageing with the appearance of fine lines. Every hour, take a few minutes and step outside of your working or artificially-lit environment - and away from all screens - into natural lighting, ideally surrounded by nature. If you can't do this, simply close your eyes for 60 seconds every hour.

Hormonal changes after menopause can cause skin to thin, impairing its barrier function and reducing its resilience.

Sustainable growers of sandalwood are like the proverbial needle in a haystack but, at Weleda, we work with two dedicated producers, both of whom meet the strict UEBT standards. To ensure a sustainable supply of precious sandalwood essential oil, Weleda has invested in an agriculture project for the future which is part of a reforestation project in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Every year, 2,500 seedlings are planted here in the open field. If all goes well, in 20 years' time they will be large and strong enough for harvesting. The sandalwood trees that are already growing naturally on the farm will be harvested bit by bit. Meanwhile, 250 trees per hectare are being planted annually, in order to establish a sustainable harvesting method. In this way, Weleda is helping to reforest and future-proof the work that joins people, plants and planet together.Evening Primrose Age Revitalising Eye and Lip Cream This wonderful multi-tasking fragrance-free cream reduces the appearance of deep lines and wrinkles.

Lavender Relaxing Bath MilkRELAX Aroma ShowerLavender Relaxing Body Care 61 60 What's good sleep hygiene? Nope, it's not how clean your bedsheets are, but how conscious your bedtime routine is. Numerous studies have found that the best way to support a restorative night's sleep is to do the same thing every night, in the same order, and at the same time - this signals to the brain that we are preparing to slow down, stop and sleep, and has been shown to result in a much better night's sleep. 1 Start an hour before bedtime, with an unwinding routine that will lead you gently and deeply into sleep. Try a nightly bath or shower with our Lavender or Arnica bath milk. 2 Create an environment of absolute darkness in your bedroom. 3 Be disciplined and stick to screen-free time from early evening onward. 4 Avoid caffeine after 3pm to ensure it will not disturb your sleep cycle. 5 Avoid vigorous exercise three hours prior to bed as this can have a stimulating effect. 6 Ensure your room is cool, and that your bed and your feet are warm. Massage Lavender Body Oil into your feet and then pop on a clean pair of socks while it absorbs. 7 Invite relaxing scents into your bedroom with a pillow spray, diffuser or simply by washing sheets with a dash of our Lavender Bath Milk in lieu of fabric softener.

Caring for yourself is a prerequisite to caring for others. And while we take care of ourselves, we also need to care for our Mother Nature! Congratulations to Weleda on its centenary of accomplishments in maintaining the integrity of self-care, social care and environmental care.\" Satish Kumar, Editor Emeritus, Resurgence & Ecologist Natural Wellness Every Day 404075 \u00a320.0081 80 Home Therapy Rosemary bath for circulation Warmth is an important support for our circulation and is vital for our wellbeing. Bathing with rosemary supports blood circulation and could make all the difference to someone who has poor circulation, Raynaud's disease or diabetes. Rosemary is a common ingredient in ointments and oils which encourage the movement of warmth - stimulating and enlivening circulation. A wonderful way to absorb rosemary's circulation-boosting benefits is to add Weleda Rosemary Bath Milk to a foot bath. The warm water with aromatic rosemary immediately stimulates blood flow and encourages warmth back into the area - a boon for those whose toes are always cold! HOME THERAPY WITH WELEDA A restorative rose, lavender and oat bath ritual 1 Prepare your bath by adding a handful of oats to the centre of a muslin cloth, and then tying it securely into a 'ball'. Then add a few drops of Weleda Lavender Bath Milk to your running bathwater. 2 Before stepping into your bath, add an extra layer of cocooning warmth to your skin by applying Weleda Wild Rose Body Oil with gentle upwards sweeping movements to your arms, legs, including your chest, tummy and lower back. 3 Now, sink into the bath, allowing the benefits of rose, lavender and oats to combine. 4 Following your therapeutic bath, gently pat yourself dry and move into a quiet area where you can rest for 30 minutes. Wrap yourself well in a warm gown and blanket. This essential 'wrapping' time allows the oil and aromatherapeutic aspects of your bath to gently permeate all levels of your being.

In the harsh climate of the Andes range the ratanhia thrives, with its spreading, branched root system serving as protection against erosion of thin, dry mountain soil. The plant has played an important role for Weleda's dental care products for over 50 years and is sustainably harvested in the wild. The root of the ratanhia plant contains calming tannins that strengthen and fortify the gums, at the same time relieving irritation in the oral cavity. Krameria lappacea Developed with dentists our holistically formulated and multi-award-winning certified natural toothpastes contain the purest plant extracts in a natural mineral base or plant-based gel to clean teeth gently but thoroughly, prevent the build-up of plaque, keep gums healthy and breath sweetly fresh. In fact the list of things not included in our range is equally if not more significant: no detergents, bleaches, foam boosters or optical brighteners, nor synthetic fragrances, colourants, flavourings, sweetening agents, emulsifiers, disinfectants or triclosan, so the balance of natural flora in the mouth is not disturbed. The range is also made without fluoride, which is particularly popular in areas where water supplies contain added fluoride. A healthy mouth with strong teeth is not only beautiful and comfortable, but an important factor in the health of the whole being. Oral Care Ratanhia Toothpaste Traditionally used by the people of the Peruvian Andes for gentle natural oral care, the ratanhia plant's natural astringent and strengthening properties are harnessed in this toothpaste. The root is rich in tannins which contribute valuable anti- bacterial properties, to strengthen and protect sensitive gums. We add extract of myrrh and refreshing essential oils of peppermint and spearmint, with calcium-based cleansers for a naturally effective toothpaste. 101002 75ml Ve \u00a35.50Children's Too th Gel Natural care for children's delicate first teeth.

Sea salt stimulates salivation to increase the cleaning power of the ingredients in this mouth-watering formulation. The zesty, salty taste is freshened with essential oil of peppermint, for tingly-fresh cleansing. Soothing myrrh and ratanhia, together with horse chestnut bark extract, are included for gum health. 101004 75ml V \u00a35.50Plant Gel Toothpaste This gel formulation with soothing chamomile is especially gentle on tooth enamel and delicate gums.

This is the subject of what is known as true cost accounting. We want to know the true costs and also find out what positive effect biodynamic cultivation has. The initial results offer hope: bitter oranges from Egypt, which we use for neroli oil, have a benefit of 3.30 euros per kilogram and 600 euros per hec tare of cultivated land.

Midwife Alicia Burnett, All4Maternity Calendula Soap Calendula Cream Bath Calendula Shampoo & Wash Calendula All Purpose Balm100 101 White Mallow BabyNaturally soothing for hyper-sensitive baby skin white mallow has long been highly regarded as a medicinal plant, and is at the heart of our multi-award-winning Baby Derma range. The soothing properties of white mallow help calm and protect reactive and hypersensitive skin, relieving itching and promoting healthy skin development. The polysaccharides in its roots are particularly effective and, combined with water, form an organic gel which provides moisture, alleviates irritation and envelopes the skin in a soothing cocoon. Organic coconut oil provides high levels of vitamin E which is essential for healthy skin growth and repair, keeping skin smooth and protecting against chapping and cracking. Recent research has also shown its effectiveness in treating atopic dermatitis in paediatric patients.WHITE MALLOW BABY CARE Accredited by the National Eczema Association With extracts of organic white mallow, pansy, organic coconut oil, borage seed oil, organic cocoa butter and sesame oil, Weleda's white mallow fragrance-free products soothe and provide intensive care for skin prone to irritation.

Organic golden beeswax creates a light water-resistant, protective layer that is ideal for dry and itchy skin. 105802 50ml V \u00a311.50 Plant Story: White Mallow At first glance, it is a rather delicate plant, but the white mallow can in fact withstand lack of water and extremes of heat with remarkable resilience. This is due to the gel-like mucilage in the flowers and roots, which prevent the plant from drying out and give mallow its soothing, emollient, protective and moisturising properties. Its delicate fragrance has a calming effect on the senses too, making it a perfect partner for baby skincare. Derma White Mallow Body Lotion Weleda asked midwives to advise on the perfect moisturising lotion, and they helped us choose the most delicate formula we've ever made. Organic white mallow extract wraps baby in a cooling protective layer, kind-hearted wild pansy extract soothes irritation, and organic coconut and sesame oils nurture the skin. The fragrance-free body lotion relieves itchiness and creates a pleasant calming sensation on the skin with just the subtle scent of coconut oil. For delicate skin that needs cosseting, it can be used by the whole family, including adults with highly sensitive skin. 105803 200ml V \u00a313.50 Althaea officinalisREVIEW My husband uses the White Mallow Body Lotion on his varicose eczema (on legs) and it's the only thing that works.

Instead, Weleda obtains Scottish-grown and biodynamically cultivated arnica from our longterm grower, Duncan Ross. Each year Duncan makes a ten- hour drive with a freshly-harvested crop. The day before the crop arrives, Duncan and four other gardeners are busy, carefully lifting each arnica plant, roots and all (planta tota), washing the roots and removing any discoloured and broken leaves. The plants are then placed upright in boxes, with their roots in fresh water, ready for the journey to Weleda Head Office. In the cool twilight hours, he sets off transporting around 100 kilos of whole fresh plants. Our Weleda gardeners meet and greet Duncan early doors - scrubbed- down and gowned-up to meet the stringent rules we work to in our pharmaceutical laboratories - and take delivery of his precious cargo. Every member of staff at Weleda knows when it's 'Arnica Day' and is ready to chip in as and when they are required. It is critical the arnica plants are processed as soon as possible in order to capture the plant's vitality. It's this duty of care to our plants and production that gives our arnica products their valuable potency and power. Always seek medical advice if your symptoms persist or are causing problems.

From the moment our head gardener judges a plant to be ready we are on countdown to harness its power. We harvest at specified times on certain days of the year. Sometimes we harvest the root, sometimes the flower, sometimes the whole plant. Our gardeners scrub-down and gown-up to meet the stringent rules we work to in our pharmaceutical laboratories. They harvest, clean, chop, grind and prepare the plant material and they work with the production team to turn this into the precious Mother Tinctures.Homeopathy - where 'like cures like' We also manufacture Homeopathic remedies. Developed by Dr Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century, homeopathy also follows a holistic approach to good health stimulating the body's natural ability to cure itself. Its guiding principle is to choose a remedy that would produce similar symptoms to those you wish to treat, i.e. 'like cures like'. Each remedy is created by a series of dilution and shaking processes to produce a minimum 'potentised' dose. Why choose Weleda?

The plant is famous for its calming properties and a valued natural anti-inflammatory with a soothing, repairing effect on the skin. \"We found the Weleda Hand Sanitiser perfect at London Fashion Show when prepping the models backstage. It's surprisingly gentle on hands, with a lovely refreshing natural scent that isn't overpowering, and it dries fast which is essential when under time pressure. We liked the fact that the ingredients are all organic, and vegan friendly , and the glass bottle is recyclable. It has become a staple for my kit.\" Makeup designer Famida Pathan Chamomilla recucita Sanitiser Calendula & Chamomile Hand Sanitiser is made with natural ingredients that provide effective anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties, with tests showing that it kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses found on hands. The addition of glycerol to keep skin supple, along with pure essential oil of grapefruit to provide a delicate fresh natural fragrance, make this hand sanitiser both skin-friendly and a pleasure to use. What's more, the calendula and chamomile are home grown organically in our biodynamic herb gardens in Derbyshire, for the ultimate in sustainable ingredient sourcing. The vegan formulation is made with 100% organic plant ingredients, and comes in recyclable amber glass packaging - with a 60ml handbag-sized spray and a great value 200ml refill size - and both bottles are beautifully decorated with botanical drawings of chamomile and calendula. 102269 Ve \u00a314.95 REVIEW I have a patch of skin on my right hand that reacts badly to most things not Weleda. It manifests as eczema and is hot and sore. I've been using the hand sanitiser religiously every day since I received it - beautiful soft safe hands. Mezzie Lucerne-Lambourne (Advisor) Hand SanitiserTurning old empties into new trees Most Weleda packaging is easily and widely recyclable via regional kerbside collection schemes with local councils, such as Weleda's glass bottles and jars, aluminium tubes and plastic lids. However most councils do not accept mixed plastics, such as Weleda's squeezy PE/PP plastic tubes, or plastics with any metal components (such as a hidden spring in a pump or nozzle), and so Weleda teamed up with waste management experts ENVA to ensure that our packaging does not need to go to landfill. Return to Weleda All Weleda customers can download the Freepost Weleda Recycling address label from our website and simply drop off their package at their nearest Post Office when it's convenient. Alternatively, customers can drop their empties off to their nearest Weleda Wellbeing Advisor (there are over 500 all around the UK).

Life of touch: restoring rhythm with rhythm Wellbeing treatments - particularly massage and the recognition of the life of touch - are very much part of Weleda's DNA.

The new course, which is open to complete beginners as well as holistic therapists or beauticians with existing qualifications, has been developed by Weleda's skincare expert Elizabeth King drawing on her 23 years' experience as a holistic facialist specialising in anthroposophic skincare, as well as 100 years of Weleda wisdom. Elizabeth is joined by a highly experienced Esthetician Training Team. The result is a fully accredited, Ofqual regulated, CFI Level 4 Award for Holistic Estheticians.What will you get out of the course?
