Not only is she highly knowledgeable about Sedona on historical, geological, and spiritual levels, but she is also uniquely gifted with intuition and creativity to customize your tour for the optimal journey, especially to explore the Land and align with your life path. She is the type of person who will still go on a four-hour tour with you despite cold, rain, and wind - and it will still be the most remarkable part of your trip! You will learn so much about who and where you are in life. Please do yourself a favor and gift yourself a memorable journey with CrystalStarrWeaver! - JMMorgan_1300Informative and BeautifulCrystal was extremely knowledgeable about everything that is Sedona. History, best views of the amazing Red Rocks and must see sites. She is personable and made us feel like friends from the very beginning. I would consider this a must do activity. - merryminnow00Grateful for Crystal and this experience!Crystal Starr Weaver gave us an uplifting and enlightening tour. She poured her energy into caring for our spiritual needs. She loves people. She loves sharing her knowledge of the land and the magic within. She taught us the geography, geology, botany, and history of the vortex areas. She is a caring, and a most amazing guide. She gave us positive guidance. We enjoyed being with her very much. - TTTNYC00THAT SEDONA MAGICI did a day trip to Sedona and had a lovely time with Crystal Starr Weaver. She had a calming peaceful energy about her and literally helped part the clouds for us that day. It was snowing really hard and there was such low visibility you couldn't see much, but after positive manifestation and trusting Mother Nature, and simply going with the vortex flow, the skies cleared and we got sunshine for the rest of our time together. A magical trip and we will return to see her again!!! - P1475YPtracyp00incredible experienceUnexpectedly received an uncommon tour-- ecological and informational and spiritual. I highly recommend this to anyone thinking about it. Unforgettable. - Clara G00AwakeningOur tour with Crystal was amazing. She merged her information with both the scientific and spiritual. Most importantly, she addressed our questions. Since this was our first visit we learned about Sedona. - Wanderer3605133493300Where the magic happensMy husband and I came seeking a vortex tour that provided guidance and wisdom! This tour was uplifting and fulfilling. The mediation and connections made will be rooted for us! We left feeling rejuvenated and recharged. Crystal Star Weaver shared her gifts with enlightenment. I can't wait to come back to recharge as needed! Magic happens here - P1475YPtracyp00Complete tour with intuition and information!!Crystal StarWeaver was outstanding. She is incredibly intuitive and took us to the perfect places for our highest best. We learned about the lore, the geology, the ecology, the biodiversity, and the history of Sedona. We visited Thunder Mountain and she talked about the fact that it is the site for the throat chakra. She facilitated a healing of that chakra for me, using words specific to my situation. It was uncanny! I keep wanting to write adjectives like 'amazing' and 'outstanding' and 'incredible' but know that those words are inferior to how I felt. She even gave a ride to a hiker who was 2 miles away from her car because she came out of the trails in the wrong place!! - jsn88800Meaningful experienceThis tour is a must if you want to gain a more intimate knowledge of the medicine wheel and vortex experience in Sedona. Crystal is a very knowledgeable and easy going guide. She had a lot of background information which made the tour more meaningful. Furthermore the whole tour was conducted in a very relaxed pace. Needless to say I highly recommend this tour if you ever find yourself in Sedona. - Christine D00Amazing experience!Amazing experience! Crystal took us to so many places and was extremely knowledgeable. We only had 1 full day in Sedona and so thankful we took this tour. We learned so much. Highly recommend!!! - 751draganak00Amazing experienceI am so glad I did this tour. My guide was amazing. I learned so much that I would never learn if I didn't take Spiritual Vortex tour. Thank you so much Crystal Star River!! - I3627ZQjoycec00Amazing, healing, transformative, beautifulHad the most special day with Chrystal. I could have set on that rock for days more talking and meditating. Was a truly transformative experience. I Wish this for everyone. If you go to Sedona, BOOK WITH CHRYSTAL!! - G1286ZAvalerieb00Incredible tour with an incredible guideOur tour with Crystal was incredible. She gave us insights to the land, the history and the stories of the places she showed us. We learned about the plants and about the damage being done to the earth, we saw ancient trees and we felt like we were connected to the earth in this beautiful place through Crystal. She also nudged us towards our own awareness of what we could be working on in our lives and how we can connect on a more universal level personally. We returned feeling centered, at peace and having learned so much from this wonderful woman. I cannot wait to return to this place I have fallen in love with. (Thank you Crystal, and just so you know, I have not said \"sorry\" much at all lately and it has been easy.) Val and Alise - John M00Great experience in SedonaCrystal was extremely knowledgeable about the area and brought us to places and showed us things we never would have found on our own. It was a great experience! - alissah51900More Than Just A TourCrystal personalized the experience for each of the four members in our group. She asked compelling questions and encouraged each of us to look within ourselves for the answers. The tour was well worth the money.

She is gentle, strong, loving and invites you to new levels of self-examination and wonders. We spent 4 hours with her and wished we could spend another 4! As we walked a creek bed, she pointed out the effect of the vortex on the trees - and brought one to our attention that started out as one tree and then branched out to two. We noted the beautiful rocks and how they were different from each other thanks to Crystal. One of the highlights was going to a medicine wheel that she created with the help of others in the community. She gave us an overview of the medicine wheel which was fascinating and powerful. When we return next year we are going to ask her to have a medicine wheel ritual. It is very difficulty to put words to spirituality and opening one self to the magic of the universe - but Crystal brought us to an amazing space personally and in our relationshiop. I could not recommend Crystal more highly - thank you, Crystal! Written January 2, 2020 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Medicine Wheel will be looking forward to our journey through it. Your words were incredible as well as your thoughtfulness to share so much. Each person who comes to Sedona can awaken to their story I will add the phrase \"self-examination and wonders\" that is a great way to explain the Awakening one goes through and it is amazing to be part of it.

She has an abundance of knowledge on the land, the history of the rocks, the personalities of the crystals, and the understanding of how to truly share the benefits of the medicine wheel. I highly recommend her if you want an authentic experience of Sedona and the vortexes and crystals.

Aug 2017 Friends I moved here several years ago and just recently decided to learn more about Sedona. I did the Medicine Wheel Journey with Crystal Starr Weaver just after the Solar Eclipse. After learning about the Wheel, the Four Directions, the Energies and the Totem Animals, she intuitively asked me a few questions which created the beginning of a powerful inner Spiritual Journey, as I was going through some major changes in my life. It was definitely a turning point for me. Thank you for the knowledge you shared and making the Medicine Wheel Journey an experience I won't forget.

Thanks for being open to more clarity on your next step on your journey. The energies were so powerful after the eclipse. I am glad you decided to walk the Medicine Wheel with me. Crystal StarrWeaver Written August 6, 2018 This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Mar 2018 Family I have been to Sedona many times, but this time I brought my daughter because I wanted to her to experience the spirituality that Sedona offers. Crystal was highly recommended by one of my friends and we had a FANTASTIC 8 hour tour with her! Not only did we get to see all the sights, but we did a medicine wheel ceremony in the moon light and had a card readings after. Crystal clearly loves doing what she does and was exhibited much knowledge and patience with us. She answered our questions thouroghly and offered us much insight. If you consider ANY personalized individual tours, look no further - she's the real deal!!

It was a pleasure to spend the day with you. The time flew by as Sedona opened her heart to both of you. What a delight to talk with your daughter and see her wisdom. The two of you are bonded together and will enhance each others life experiences. Thank you for choosing me as a guide through Sedona as well as a guide in your journey of life. Thank you Written April 21, 2018 This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC. A friend of mine and I traveled our way to Sedona from New York for a spiritual experience, and we definitely couldn't have been happier with Crystal Starr Weaver. We met Crystal on a whim, as we were strangely drawn to her shop in Sedona. We experienced the Medicine Wheel, in addition to a tour of some of the best vortex in Sedona. Crystal was not only insightful, but very compassionate to our life stories as we were able to release negative energies, and replace them with positive ones. She even hand drew out a map of the best places to visit in Sedona for us. What an amazing experience! Thank you Crystal!! Not even the rain would stop us from this wonderful experience. I would recommend Crystal's tours to anyone wishing to seek spiritual guidance for their life path, as well as those wishing to experience the true essence of Sedona.

Thank you very much for your kind words. The Medicine Wheel speaks to everyone who is open to listen. It listens to your heart too and knows you more than you know. Thank you for choosing your time with me on the land. Bring the teaching into your life on an everyday basis. Thank you for being open and emerging like the butterfly.

Jan 2018 Business Was in Sedona for a business MasterMind retreat with friends & wanted a spiritual experience. I looked up the Sedona Chamber & contacted a few tour/experience guides. How lucky that Crustal was available to spend the afternoon with 6 of us - educating and fascinating learnings around the Medicine Wheel, than a guided meditation on the Labyrinth Walk. Insightful & delightful are 2 words to describe Crystal and the afternoon. She is FABULOUS!
