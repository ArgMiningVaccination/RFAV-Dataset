I've heard left-leaning journalists actually say that taking a job based on ones family name is a problem. It is a point of attack for sure, but nothing more.

To keep it simple lets call them the cold-obective world (everything is just lego pieces with no memory with no actual objective definable objects (a person, a planet) nor concepts/actions (fun, sex, love). vs the human-centric world (the world as we see it through our limited perspective through the lens of human experience). So when you are talking about anything...you really have to keep both of those things separate and contained. For example, if my argument is \"there are no real objects in the universe\" then our discussion here is clearly in the cold-objective world. There is no need to drag objects defined by subjective humans into this. We are simply dealing with a basic metaphysical theory. If on the other hand we are discussing sex and the objectification of a sex partner...then we are dealing with the human-centric (subjective) sphere/perspective and there is no reason to bring in the concept of lego pieces into the discussion. Seriously...a conversation should be about how we are lego pieces...or it should be about human-centric objects and concepts and their qualities etc. Mixing them is ridiculous. If you are making love then we aren't just talking about lego pieces. We are talking about concepts invented by humans about humans through the human perspective. You are a person. You are making love with a person. The only point of mixing the two (a subjective human being making love with just lego pieces) is to inject a spiritual aura into a conversation and confuse matters (which can be solved or overwritten with the religions own world view or solution). If you are making love you make love with another object that can make love. If you are lego pieces then thats it...just lego pieces everywhere...theres nothing else to say. Don't mix them. Nothing of value comes from it.

At one point they said they were convinced of its rightness but his every post is saying some fundamental tenet is nonsense. If you fully on board with Buddhism then youd be more positive about. If you not on board with the central tenet of achieving enlightenment, then what is it you are looking? Much of Buddhism is built around that. It's nonsense if aren't. Theres probably stuff that is beneficial if applied appropriately, but taken to crazy extreme probably damaging. Non attachment for example. You could apply something along that lines to your life and be a positive thing. If you go too far with it, it's probably damaging and unachievable.

It's like with the \"perfect world 2\" post that I created a few threads up, I can't really find out how it's wrong and the more I think about it the more it seems true. Like how \"everything is necessary and perfect\" and that problems are just our judgments placed on the world. Buddhism is in a similar vein, I just can't prove it wrong.

It's an unfortunate cosmic irony that I'm sitting here making a video referencing NB philosophy and citing NB thinkers even as these concerns have been raised, but I am happy to clarify that I of course stand by my earlier work supporting trans and NB rights! It is not appropriate for me, as a cis man, to police trans and NB communities, and anyone who's followed my work for long knows I don't do personal condemnations - I made a promise to myself when I started the channel that I would never use it to single out any particular person and make them feel bad, and I always try to work from curiosity not ambition!

I still think this is still far, far better than silence. But, especially when compared to the clear and emotional statement by Hbomb, it's impossible to deny where this falls short. Olly not only doesn't condemn Buck Angel, but doesn't note him or any of the specific details of Contra's mistakes at all. That being said, there is no excuse whatsoever for the threats and doxxing that Olly has suffered. No ifs or buts. I also didn't know he was dealing with 'various personal tragedies'.

I'm just also sure that there's more going on here than what's being said in public, and the internet's anger towards Wynn's friends isn't helping anyone. - I'd be really ticked off if my irl friend did something bad and now people demand me to cease ties. I do, however, would still condemn my friend. IRL my friend did - Ellis' and Brewis' seemed the most genuine to me. I think it's fair for Ellis to absolve herself of responsibility because she wasn't involved. I agree with her that a bunch of internet strangers shouldn't tell someone to drop a real-life friendship over more internet drama. Having so many strangers dog me on social media and in my emails about that would probably piss me off too. - I don't think \"harass\" is the most accurate characterization of people's (particularly nonbinary people) concerns over the close connections to ContraPoints, like concern that there's a group mentality among the big BreadTubers on the issues of nonbinary. The bigger people have to respond, otherwise it seems like they don't really care and that'll aliennate a big portion of their audience. I'm not particularly happy about Lindsay Ellis's response though. Just seems like an attempt to duck because Lindsay wasn't directly involved in that video. But I can't blame Lindsay because I'd jump to the defense of my friend though tbf I'd focus more on criticizing what the friend did and send some Mario of Disappointment instead. --It's-a me, - They're all responding at the same time because people are harassing them. ContraPoints collaborated with and said it was an honour to work with transmasc Buck Angel, a horrible piece of shit notorious for outing closeted transgender people out of spite and intentionally harming non-binary and other transgender people with his truscum rhetoric. He's also friends with Graham Linehan. There is essentially no way Wynn did not know who this person was before collaborating with him (it's as easy as a Google search), so it seemed certain this was a dogwhistle - when you also consider Wynn has gotten into significant trouble for debatably spouting transmedicalist views. In response, trans people and trans allies denounced, and demanded an explanation/apology from ContraPoints, and when Wynn ignored it, demanded statements from Contra's friends - the situation not being helped by a tweet by PhilosophyTube joking about being cancelled for collaborating with Wynn the day prior to things blowing up. During the week of radio silence, some people, disgustingly, resorted to threats and apparently even doxxing, which made the situation worse. Eventually, most of ContraPoints' friends made statements of varying weight, the first being Hbomberguy admitting a sense of betrayal, and Lindsay denouncing the 'campaign' against Wynn and by extension her. There has still been no statement from ContraPoints herself, and the situation seems to be dying down - although there's no denying all the burnt bridges. I have to say, it's very hard to see what Wynn could possibly do at this point to fully recover from the aftermath of her behaviour.

What is love? (for real this time)[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive328&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] I have heard it said that it is a verb, or a state of being, and in addition to the verb part that it is what you do not how you feel. Is it unconditional or does such a thing exist (the unconditional, not the love). I asked this on that actualized.org place and they said it was Attention,but then I questioned that attention doesn't necessarily mean love and many things can be \"attention\" but not be love. My thread was locked saying I was looking for a specific answer instead of asking a question, but I think it's because I questioned their responses. So here I am. I mean I can say it is a form of attention I guess but that's not it. [Machina](/w/index.php?title=User:Machina&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Machina)) 19:07, 21 October 2019 (UTC) - Love. It's a chemical reaction in the brain. Developed mostly to ensure strong family bonds and mating bonds, which has been a strong adaptive feature in most mammals. As with all things in the human being, and all emotions we experience, they have spiraled completely out of control which can bring a lot of happiness, extremely strong mating bonds and family cohesiveness, happiness etc but also out of control irratic behaviour to the point that love leads humans to do remarkably unhelpful and unhealthy actions, obsessions, violence, self-destruction, hysteria, stalking, sexual harassment, lethargy, emotionally crippling depression, lethargy, emotional manipulation. Love is glorified as something more than just a neuro/physical process. Love is portrayed overwealmingly through its positive aspects giving it a cosmic quality of absolute good and apart from loss through heartbreak, only recently has the extremely destructive side of love been explored culturally and psychologically. When mixed together with religious ridiculousness and social mythology (there is one soulmate out there waiting for you, love is true, love is a profound connection beyond the physical) I would argue, that more than any other concept...love has been completely blown out of all proportion. That's not to say love isn't a spectacular thing for those who have found it an maintained it, or have loving families etc. It can be an intense almost intolerable emotion (in both positive and negative ways). But it's still just a complex of emotions and physical reactions. And evolutionary process just like any other in which luck plays a very large part. [Shabi](/wiki/User:Shabidoo) [DOO](/wiki/User_talk:Shabidoo)19:53, 21 October 2019 (UTC) - I have to disagree.

The actualized people were wrong to just call it attention, because it's not (I know that much). They didn't take too kindly to that reply. From what I gather the social definition of it is a feeling followed by actions.

In considering RationalWiki, it is critical to note that the website was created as \"a liberal response to Conservapedia\" (Yan et al., 2017),11 and that in its own words, \"RationalWiki is not neutral\" (RationalWiki, 2019a). Furthermore, RationalWiki's attack pages on intelligence researchers contain numerous factual errors (such as unwarranted imputations of political affinities, using terms like 'alt-right', 'eugenicist' etc.), coupled with unsubstantiated claims that those researchers are engaged in 'pseudoscience'.12 Collectively, these pages demonstrate poor understanding of the relevant literature on the part of RationalWiki's contributors, as well as unchecked ideological bias. In fact, the existence of these pages is illustrative of the ease with which 'fake news' and other misinformation can spread online, creating yet more hazards for individuals who choose to grapple with controversial but important topics in the field of intelligence research. More broadly, these hazards of the internet may have been the major reason why the LCI era has been so severe relative to other, previous eras of controversy. lol [oozzn](/wiki/User:FuzzyCatPotato) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:FuzzyCatPotato)/ [stalk](/wiki/Special:Contributions/FuzzyCatPotato)) 20:57, 22 October 2019 (UTC) - Fucking lol at the fig 3.

The biggest crime. In 1981, William Shockley sued the Atlanta Constitution newspaper for libel after a science writer compared one of Shockley's policy proposals to Nazi eugenics - Wow that sounds pretty serious, what thing is so unreasonable to compare to nazi eugenics? Let's go to another source and find out Shockley's later life was marked by bitter controversy over his claims that intelligence was genetically determined and that blacks were genetically inferior and as a group could not be as bright as whites. He suggested in a theory he called retrogressive evolution that intellectually inferior blacks were producing child faster than mentally superior whites. Shockley sees his day in court against the city's leading newspaper, the Atlanta Constitution, as a forum for his incendiary views on race and intelligence, human quality control and his Voluntary Sterilization Bonus Plan (VSBP): to pay anyone with a low IQ or with some genetically transmitted diseases to be sterilized. - Oh, how completely incomparable.

Those not vaccinated cannot attend public school so diseases are unable to spread. Those with diseases that prevent vaccination would fall under the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Act. Would that create a legal grey area? Also, should there be tax payer funded schools for those who cannot get vaccinated?

[the recommend human experimentation to \"spare the animals\"](https://homeopathyplus.com/tutorial-6-provings/) [symptoms returning is deemed to mean successful healing is happening](https://homeopathyplus.com/tutorial-11-return-of-old-symptoms/) Just all sorts of bullshit like that. Though my favorite quote comes the very end Once you have taken your first dose of a homeopathic remedy, one of the following seven things will happen - A curative response - your symptoms get better and go away. - A similar aggravation - your symptoms first worsen and then improve. - A dissimilar aggravation - new symptoms appear for a short time but your old ones stay the same. - Accessory symptoms - your symptoms improve but in the process a new one appears for a short period. - Return of old symptoms - your existing symptoms improve but in the process, old symptoms from the past return for a short period. - A surrogate discharge or eruption appears for a short time. - Absolutely nothing happens.

I would like to introduce a new phrase(On the stars of Debate Me You Coward)[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive328&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)] Trash talk is one of my least favorite methods of communicating between two opposing forces. But I admit, it can be an art, and it can be mutual, and I try very hard to not let trash talk bother me. However, there's a new method, that I haven't really noticed until now, and I want to call it \"dumpsterspeak.\" It's that moment in a game where you see somebody gets bodied and they say \"well, if you weren't [such and such] I would have won.\" Not exactly wrong, but not exactly being fair to your own meta. I like pushing the meta, I don't mind being beat up, but that's the actual point of pushing a meta. In terms of the review of the Prager/Corolla flick, when somebody says something like \"debate me you coward\" and claims persecution over forums they don't control while still being totally accepted within those forums, that's not trash talk, that's dumpsterspeak. When somebody gets beat by a new meta and they say \"well anybody can spam that bull\" but refuse to change their own playstyle, that's dumpsterspeak. When somebody tries a new meta and it doesn't work and they say \"well everybody plays that bull,\" that's dumpsterspeak. Trying to push your meta as correct, aggrandizing/consolidating your opposition, and then playing it off like that's everyone else's fault. That's dumpsterspeak. \"Debate Me You Coward\" is titled as dumpsterspeak, not as trash talk. If the challengers of the narrative actually know how to debate, they don't need to sit in their defeatist corners and drum up support. They can actually push their meta.

I was watching [Zachary K. Hubbard](/wiki/Zachary_K._Hubbard)'s recent video today ( [https://youtu.be/hUP76WYanQg](https://youtu.be/hUP76WYanQg)). At 16:20 he complains about his critics trolls only focusing on the games he gets wrong. He gets most right so it proves him right. [FACEPALM]...Okay, so answer me this, even when he gets games right, how are we supposed to undeniably believe it's rigged, and we're stupid if we don't?! so he gets sports picks right, SO FUCKING WHAT, it's NOT proof. Hubbard should pick up a book from [Carl Sagan](/wiki/Carl_Sagan) and learn a little about logic, maybe then he'd get a job. But also listen to how he calls his critics trolls \"fucking stupid\", lol he actually sounds triggered. I think he's legit \"Pissed at us\" (oh and btw he gives us another shout out near the beginning of the video). Another piece of information I have yet to discuss: anyone notice that even though he claims not to be in on this for money, he's running a Patreon, shilling out his book, shilling out his merchandise (I am not fucking kidding, go to his website and find it), and asking for donations? Seems INCREDIBLY fishy. [Aaronmichael5](/wiki/User:Aaronmichael5) 22:43 October 27th - I suppose that even he has to eat, and somehow I doubt the NWO has the budget (or desire) to send him pizza.

Keep : ) [G Man](/wiki/User:G_Man) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:G_Man)) 23:28, 28 October of the Chinese RationalWiki project[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive328&action=edit\u00a7ion=36)] Here's something you might not know: RationalWiki has had a Chinese-language section for some time already. I have expanded the Chinese RationalWiki project by translating [Pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience), a core article, into Chinese as [](/wiki/%E4%BC%AA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6). I left the redlinks in instead of piping to the English counterpart so that they can point to which articles to translate next. Stubs on [\u00b7](/wiki/%E7%90%86%E6%9F%A5%E5%BE%B7%C2%B7%E9%81%93%E9%87%91%E6%96%AF) (Dawkins) and [](/wiki/%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6) (Science) have been started. I hope that once the pages get search engine indexed, some new Chinese users will start rolling in and translating articles into Chinese. Having more RationalWiki articles available in Chinese would greatly help stem the spread of pseudoscience. Additionally, it would be great if some Chinese-speaking users could help translate other articles into Chinese. Right now, the articles are in Simplified Chinese. It would be great to have Traditional as well, but this raises the question of how it would be implemented should the demand for it grow. If anyone here speaks Chinese, you would be welcome to check the Chinese articles for typos. Also, brace for impact: I am translating [Tiananmen Square Massacre](/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_Massacre), so access to RationalWiki in China could become, shall we say, spotty. [Jia Zhiyan](/wiki/User:Jia_Zhiyan) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Jia_Zhiyan)) 03:06, 29 October 2019 (UTC) - @ [Jia Zhiyan](/wiki/User:Jia_Zhiyan)Don't forget to add links to the pages you created to the Greek Pseudoscience article and the French and Portuguese Science articles. On your translations, you should also use the hatnote template at the top of the page to link to the English version. That's to prevent people who come to the article by clicking on \"Random page\" from saying, \"What the hell is this crap?\" I've added the hatnote to the Chinese Pseudoscence and Science pages. Since the Richard Dawkins Chinese page is currently quite short and you can see the link in \"See also\" without having to scroll down, I didn't add the hatnote to that page.

I hope Brexit follies Part Trois: New elections on 12 December?[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive328&action=edit\u00a7ion=37)] So, apparently the following things have happened last week (I haven't checked the whole Brexit situation in a while, so): 1. UK's brexit date has been moved to 31/01/2020. 2. Johnson wants new elections on the 12th of December. 3. According to some sources in the UK, the conservatives are pretty sure that they would win these elections. 4. Opposition parties [SNP](/wiki/Scottish_National_Party) & the [lib-dems](/wiki/Liberal_Democrats) are also agreeing with new elections, because they believe it's the only way to make sure there will be a second referendum by winning these elections. Labour is against it, since they fear that they might get several punches in their guts (labour isn't scoring well in the election polls, it seems). 5. And just now, I read that Corbyn is probably going to agree with new elections? Since we have brits over here, can you answer the following questions for me?: 1. What the fuck is going on? 2. If elections were to happen on the 12/12, who would REALLY win? 3. If the opposition wins, would they be able to hold a second referendum (people who recently became adults should actually have the chance to saying whether they're for, or against it. Or whether they don't know)? 4. Is brexit still going to happen? This isn't the first time that the UK wanted to leave, and afterwards backpedaled on their decision.

[ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)15:18, 29 October 2019 (UTC) - We are talking socialist with a very small 's' here though, and that's an improvement on the blair years. the lib dems have always positioned themselves as being in the middle of labour and conservative, but labours not really been far enough left until very recently, and the conservatives not far enough right, again until recently, for the lib dems to really stand out beyond a protest vote for lab/con voters. they only really stand out in any substantial way now as being definitely opposed to Brexit. something labour ought to have done but haven't much their detriment (and as a consequence the detriment of the whole of the uk) but to the benefit of the lib dems who seem to have managed to wash off the stench from their pact with the conservatives awhile back. enough to be a suitable spoiler to split the labour vote. I very much doubt the Brexit party will have a similar effect on the cons dispite farage's desperate insistence he has any kind of relevance these days. - but as I said earlier and everyone has said and can see, who the fuck knows what will happen? polls only tell half the story and they've lost so much credibility since the referendum - remain should have won according to polls around the time, the actual result was a shock to even farage (but not if you were paying attention to outside your bubble) [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 17:19, 29 October 2019 (UTC) - If [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above#Re-open_Nominations_.28RON.29)was an option it would gain a majority.

[Bongolian](/wiki/User:Bongolian)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Bongolian)) 19:41, 29 October 2019 (UTC) - 1. What the fuck is going on? Parliament is trying yet another way out of the impasse it has created for itself. Doubly so for the Tories. - 2. If elections were to happen on the 12/12, who would REALLY win? Pretty likely to be the Tories, given that BoJo seems to be able to convince a large portion of English voters that he's the man of the hour, who can deliver some sort of totemic Brexit. Meanwhile, Labour still battles itself, Corbyn's inscrutable leadership (especially on Brexit), while the LibDems have been saved from complete irrelevance by their sudden \"road to Brussels conversion\" to \"hard Remain\". - 3. If the opposition wins, would they be able to hold a second referendum (people who recently became adults should actually have the chance to saying whether they're for, or against it. Or whether they don't know)? Labour said they want to (after they negotiate a new deal), with the options being Remain/(Their) Deal. This will probably not go down well if they end up in a Lib/Lab coalition, which already looks unlikely due to the LibDems' views on Corbyn; though the LibDems have a sordid history of throwing all of their core promises overboard to get into power, so who knows... - 4. Is brexit still going to happen? Almost certainly, because that's the baseline outcome of almost every scenario. The Tories have decided to none come more or less a Brexit party in order to appease those that might consider voting for Farage. Labour battles itself over what it wants from the EU and none of the other parties are going to be big enough on a UK-wide level to really push Brexit one way or another.
