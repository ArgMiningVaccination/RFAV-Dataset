Application to Enroll or Change Coverage The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) specifies that an eligible person must enroll for cover age or change plans during the A nnual Open Enrollment Period. Persons who fail to enroll or change plans during the Annual Open Enrollment Period must wait until the next Annual Open Enrollment Period to enroll in a plan or to change plans. However, if a person experiences a triggering event as described below, the triggering event starts a 60- day Special Enrollment Period during which an eligible person can enroll and an Insured Person can add dependents and change coverage. The Annual Open Enrollment Period and Special Enrollment Period are explained below. Annual Open Enrollment Perio d The Annual Open Enrollment Period is a specified period of time, specified under federal and Colorado law , each Year during which Individuals who are eligible as described above can apply to enroll for coverage or change coverage from one plan to another. To be enrolled for coverage under this Plan. You must submit a completed and signed application for coverage under this Policy for Yourself and any eligible Dependents, and We must receive that application during the Annual Open Enrollment Period. Your coverage under this Policy will then become effective upon the earliest day allowable under federal rules for that Year's Open Enrollment P eriod. Note: If You do not apply to obtain or change coverage during the Annual Open Enrollment Period, You will not be able to apply again until the following Year's Annual Open Enrollment Period unless You qualify for a special enrollment period as described below. Special Enrollment Periods A special enrollment period occurs when a person experiences a trigger ing event. When You are notified or become aware of a triggering event that will occur in the future, you may apply for enrollment in a new health benefit plan during the sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effective date of the triggering event, with coverage beginning no earlier than the day the triggering event occurs to avoid a gap in coverage. You must be able to provide written documentation to support the effective date of the triggering event at the time of application. If You experience one of the triggering events listed below, You can enroll for coverage and enroll Your e ligible Dependent(s) during a special enrollment period instead of waiting for the next Annual Open Enrollment Period. Triggering events for a special enrollment period OFF Marketplace are: An eligible individual, and any dependent(s), loses his or her minimum essential coverage; or An eligible individual and his or her dependent(s) lose employer -sponsored health plan coverage due to voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than misconduct, or due to a reduction in work hours; or An eligible individual gains a dependent or becomes a dependent by marriage, civil union, birth, adoption, placement for adoption , placement in foster care, through a child support order or other court order, or by entering into a designated beneficiary agreement pursuant to Colorado law , or An eligible dependent spouse or child loses coverage under an employer -sponsored health plan due to the employee's becoming entitl ed to Medicare, divorce or legal separation of the covered employee, and death of the covered employee; or An eligible individual loses his or her dependent child status under a parent's employer -sponsored health plan; or An individual who was not previous ly a citizen, national or lawfully present individual gains such status; or COINDEPO042017 MIEP0160 19 An eligible individual's enrollment or non- enrollment in a qualified health plan is unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous and as the result of the error, misrepresentation, or i naction of an officer, employee or agent of the state Marketplace, or of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or its instrumentalities as determined by the Marketplace. In such cases, the Marketplace may take such action as may be necessary t o correct or eliminate the effects of such error, misrepresentation or action; or An eligible individual is determined newly eligible or newly ineligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit or has a change in eligibility for cost -sharing reducti ons available through the Marketplace or has a dependent enrolled in the same qualified health plan who is determined newly eligible or ineligible for the federal advance payment tax credit or has a change in eligibility for cost -sharing reductions availab le through the Marketplace, regardless of whether such individual is already enrolled in a qualified health plan. The Marketplace must permit individuals whose existing coverage through an eligible employer -sponsored plan will no longer be affordable or pr ovide minimum value for his or her employer's upcoming plan year to access this special enrollment period prior to the end of his or her coverage through such eligible employer -sponsored plan; or An eligible individual gains access to new qualified health plans as a result of a permanent move (including a move outside the service area of the individual's current plan). Triggering events do not include loss of coverage due to failure to make premium payments on a timely basis, including COBRA premiums prior to expiration of COBRA coverage; and situations allowing for a rescission as specified in 45 CFR 147.128.

CHOICE OF HOSPITAL AN D PHYSICIAN : Nothi ng contained in this Policy restricts or interferes with an Insured Person's right to select the Hospital or Physician of their choice. However, non -emergency services from a Non- Participating Provider are not covered by this Plan. THIS IS A NETWORK -ONL Y PLAN That means this Plan does not provide benefits for any services You receive from an Out -of-Network Provider except: Services for Stabilization and initial treatment of a Medical Emergency , or Medically Necessary services that are not available thr ough an In- Network (Participating) Provider In-Network (Participating) Providers include Physicians, Hospitals, and other health care facilities. Check the Provider directory, available at www. mycigna.com, or call the number on Your ID card to determine if a Provider is In- Network (Participating) . COINDEPO042017 MIEP0160 23 Choosing a Primary Care Physician When You enroll as an Insured Person , You must choose a Primary Care Physician (PCP). Each covered Family Member also must choose a PCP. If You do not select a PCP, we will ass ign one for You. If Your PCP ceases to be a Participating Physician, You will be able to choose a new PCP. Your choice of a PCP may affect the specialists and facilities from which You may receive services. Your choice of a specialist may be limited to s pecialists in Your PCP's medical group or network, including a Limited Network. Therefore, You may not have access to every specialist or Participating Provider in your Service Area. Before You select a PCP, you should check to see if that PCP is associa ted with the specialist or facility You prefer to use. If the Referral is not possible, You should ask the specialist or facility about which PCPs can make Referrals to them, and then verify the information with the PCP before making your selection. Changing Primary Care Physicians You may voluntarily change Your PCP but not more than once in any calendar month. We reserve the right to determine the number of times during a Plan Year that You will be allowed to change Your PCP. You may request a change fr om one Primary Care Physician to another by contacting Us at the Customer Service number on Your ID card. Any such change will be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the processing of the change request is completed. In add ition, if at any time a Primary Care Physician ceases to be a Participating Provider, We will notify You 30 days in advance, for the purpose of selecting a new Primary Care Physician. If Your PCP Leaves the Network If Your PCP or In -Network Specialist ceases to be a Participating Physician, We will notify You in writing of his or her impending termination at least 30 days in advance of the date the PCP leaves the network and provide assistance in selecting a new PCP or identifying a new In-Network Special ist to continue providing Covered Services. If You are receiving treatment from a Participating Provider at the time his or her Participating Provider agreement is terminated, for reasons other than medical incompetence or professional misconduct, You may be eligible for continued care with that Provider. Referrals to Specialists You must obtain a Referral from Your PCP before visiting any Provider other than Your PCP in order for the visit to be covered. The Referral authorizes the specific number of vis its that You may make to a P rovider within a specified period of time. If You receive treatment from a Provider other than Your PCP without a Referral from Your PCP, the treatment is not covered and You will be responsible for paying 100% of the associated costs. Exceptions to the Referral process: If You are a female Insured Person, You may visit a qualified Participating Provider for covered obstetrical and gynecological services, as defined in \" Benefits/Coverage (What Is Covered) \" without a Referral f rom Your PCP. You do not need a PCP referral for Virtual visits with a Telehealth Connection Program Physician. If You are an Insured Person under age 19, You may visit a n etwork dentist for Pediatric Dental Benefits or a Provider in Cigna's vision network for Pediatric Vision Benefits without a Referral from Your PCP. You do not need a Referral from Your PCP for Emergency Services as defined in the \"Definitions.\" In the event of an emergency, get help immediately. Go to the nearest emergency room, the nearest hospital or call or ask someone to call 911 or Your local emergency service, police or fire department for help. You do not need a Referral from Your PCP for Emergency Services, but You do need to call Your PCP as soon as possible for further assis tance and advice on follow -up care. In an emergency, You should seek immediate medical attention and then as soon as possible thereafter You need to call Your PCP for further assistance and advice on follow -up care. COINDEPO042017 MIEP0160 24 In an Urgent Care situation a Refer ral is not required but You should, whenever possible, contact Your PCP for direction prior to receiving services. You may also visit a qualified Participating Provider for covered Pediatric Vision Care Services and Pediatric Dental Care Services, as def ined in \"Covered Services and Supplies\", without a referral from Your PCP. Standing Referral to Specialist You may apply for a standing referral to a Provider other than Your PCP when all of the following conditions apply: 1. You are enrolled for covera ge under this Plan; 2. You have a disease or condition that is life threatening, degenerative, chronic or disabling; 3. Your PCP in conjunction with a n In Network specialist determines that Your care requires another Provider's expertise; 4. Your PCP deter mines that Your disease or condition will require ongoing medical care for an extended period of time; 5. The standing referral is made by Your PCP to a n In-Network specialist who will be responsible for providing and coordinating Your specialty care; and 6. The In-Network specialist is authorized by Cigna to provide the services under the standing referral. We may limit the number of visits and time period for which You may receive a standing referral. If You receive a standing referral or any other referral from Your PCP, that referral remains in effect even if the PCP ceases to be a Participating Physician. If the treating specialist leaves Cigna's network or You cease to be an Insured Person, the standing referral expires. Network Exception If Medical ly Necessary Covered Services are not available through Participating Physicians or Participating Providers, Cigna will, upon the request of a n In-Network PCP or Provider: Allow Referral to an Out -of-Network (Non- Participating) Provider; and Fully reimburse the Out -of-Network (Non- Participating) Provider at the Usual and Customary rate or at an agreed rate: Prior to denying a request for referral to an Out -of-Network (Non- Participating) Provider, Cigna must provide for a review conducted by a Specialist of the same or similar type of specialty as the Physician or Provider to whom the Referral is requested. Continuity of Care There may be instances in which Your PCP or specialist ceases to be a Participating Physician. In such cases, You will be notified and provided assistance in selecting a new PCP or identifying a new In -network specialist to continue providing Covered Services. However, in special circumstances, You may be able to continue seeing Your PCP or specialist, even though he or she is no lon ger affiliated with Cigna. Continuity of Care allows You to receive services at In- network coverage levels if Your PCP is leaving the network and You (i) are receiving an on- going course of treatment for a life- threatening disease or condition, or a degenerative or disabling disease or condition, or (ii) have entered Your second trimester of pregnancy as of the effective date of Your enrollment. You may be eligible to receive continuity of care from that N on-Participating Provider for a transitional peri od of up to ninety (90) days, or the post -partum period directly related to the delivery of Your child. Such continuity of care must be approved in advance by Cigna, and Your doctor must agree to accept our reimbursement rate and to abide by Cigna's polici es and procedures and quality assurance requirements. There may be additional circumstances where continued care by a Provider who ceases to be a Participating Provider will not be available, such as when the Provider loses his/her license to practice or r etires.

Claim Determination Procedures Under Federal Law (Prov isions of the laws of Colorado may supersede.) Colorado law def ines \"Utilization Review\" as a set of formal techniques designed to monitor the use of, or evaluate the clinical necessity, appropriateness, efficacy, or efficiency of, health care services, procedures, or settings. Techniques include ambulatory review, pr ospective review, second opinion, certification, concurrent review, case management, discharge planning, or retrospective review. Utilization Review also includes reviews for the purpose of determining coverage based on whether or not a procedure or treat ment is considered experimental or investigational in a given circumstance, and reviews of a covered person's medical circumstances when necessary to determine if an exclusion applies in a given situation. The following information provides further detail on utilization review procedures. Procedures Regarding Medical Necessity Determinations In general, health services and benefits must be Medically Necessary to be covered under the Policy. The procedures for determining Medical Necessity vary, according t o the type of service or benefit requested, and the type of health plan. Medical Necessity determinations are made on either a pre- service, concurrent, or post -service basis, as described below. Certain services require Prior Authorization in order to be covered. This prior authorization is called a \"pre- service medical necessity determina tion.\" The Policy describes who is responsible for obtaining this review. The Insured Person or their authorized representative (typically, their health care Provider) mu st request Medical Necessity determinations according to the procedures de scribed below, in the Policy, and in the Insured Person's P rovider's network participation documents as applicable. When services or benefits are determined to be not Medically Neces sary, the Insured Person or their representative will receive a written description of the adverse determination, and may appeal the determination. Appeal procedures are described in the Policy, in the Insured Person's Provider's network participation doc uments, and in the determination notices. Pre-service Medical Necessity Determinations When the Insured Person or their representative requests a required Medical Necessity de termination prior to care, Cigna will notify the Insured Person or their representative of the determination within 15 days after receiving the request. However, if more time is needed due to matters beyond C igna's control, C igna will notify the Insured Person or their representative within 15 days after receiving the request. This notice will include the reason for the requested extensions and the date a determination can be expected, which will be no more than 30 days after receipt of the request.

If the determination periods above would (a) seriously jeopardize the Insured Person's life or health, their ability to regain maximum function, or (b) in the opi nion of a Physician with knowledge of the Insured Person's health condition, cause them severe pain which cannot be managed without the requested services, C igna will make the pre-service determination on an expedited basis. C igna's Physician reviewer, in consultation with the treating Physician will decide if an expedited determination is necessary. C igna will notify the Insured Person or their representative of an expedited determina tion wi thin 72 hours after receiving the request. However, if necessary information is missing from the request, C igna will notify the Insured Person or their representative within 24 hours after receiving the r equest to specify what information is needed. The I nsured person or their representative must provide the specified information to C igna within 48 hours after receiving the notice. Cigna will notify the Insured Person or their representative of the expedited benefit determination within 48 hours COINDEPO042017 MIEP0160 60 after the Insured Person or their representative responds to the notice. Expedited determinations may be provided orally, followed within 3 days by written or elec tronic notification. If the Insured Person or their representative fails to follow C igna's procedures for requesting a required pre- service medical necessity determination, C igna will notify them of the failure and describe the proper procedures for filing within 5 days (or 24 hours, if an expedited determination is required, as described above) after receiving the request.

Post -service Medical Necessity Determinations When an Insured Person or their representative req uests a Medical Necessity determination after services have been rendered, C igna will notify them of the determination within 30 days after receiving the request. Ho wever, if more time is needed to make a determination due to matters beyond C igna's control , Cigna will notify the Insured Person or their representative within 30 days after receiving the request. This notice will include the reason for the requested extensions and the date a determination can be expected, which w ill be no more than 45 days aft er receipt of the r equest. If more time is needed because necessary information is missing from the request, the notice will also specify what information is needed, and the Insured Person or their representative must provide the specified information to C igna within 45 days after receiving the notice. The determination period will be suspended on the date C igna sends such a notice of missing information, and the determination period will resume on the date the Insured Person or their representative responds to the notice. Post -service Claim Determinations When an Insured Person or their representative requests payment for services which have been rendered, C igna will notify them of the claim payment determina tion within 30 days after receiving the request .

We may have a right to a lien, to the extent of benefits advanced, upon any recovery that You receive from the third party, the third party's insurer, or the third party's guarantor. Recovery may be by settlement, judgment or otherwise. The lien will be in the amount of benefits paid by Us under t his Policy for the treatment of the Illness, disease, Injury or condition for which the third party is liable. We will be entitled to collect on our lien even if the amount recovered by or for the Insured Person (or his or her estate, parent or legal guard ian) from or for the account of such third party as compensation for the Injury, Illness or condition is less than the actual loss suffered by the Insured Person.

An alternate treatment plan may include services or supplies otherwise limited or excluded by t he Policy. The alternate treatment plan must be mutually agreed to by Us, the Insured Person, and the Physician, Provider, or other healthcare practitioner.

Other Insurance With This Insurer If while covered under this Policy, the Insured Person(s ) is also covered by another Cigna individual or group Policy, the Insured Person(s) will be entitled to the benefits of only one Policy. Insured Person(s) may choose this Policy or the Policy under which Insured Person(s) will be covered. Cigna will then refund any premium received under the other Policy covering the time period both policies were in effect. COINDEPO042017 MIEP0160 63 However, any claims payments made by Us under the Policy You elect to cancel will be deducted from any such refund of premium.

Adverse determination means: A denial of a preauthorization for a covered benefit; A deni al of a request for benefits for an individual on the ground that the treatment or covered benefit is not medically necessary, appropriate, effective, or efficient or is not provided in or at the appropriate health care setting or level of care; A rescissi on or cancellation of coverage under a health coverage plan that is not attributable to failure to pay premiums and that is applied retroactively; A denial of a request for benefits on the ground that the treatment or service is experimental or investigati onal; or COINDEPO042017 MIEP0160 70 A denial of coverage to an individual based on an initial eligibility determination. Requests for appeal regarding an adverse determination of the Insured Person's issue will be conducted by a Committee, which consists of one or more people not pr eviously involved in the prior decision. The Committee will consult with at least one Physician in the same or similar specialty as the care under consideration, as determined by Cigna's Physician reviewer. For all other coverage plan- related appeals, a review will be conducted by someone who was a) not involved in any previous decision related to the Insured Person's appeal, and b) not a subordinate of previous decision makers. The Insured Person has the following rights: (1) to attend the Committee review in person, or via teleconference or video conference; (2) to present their situation to the Committee in person or in writing; (3) to submit supporting material both before and at the Committee r eview; (4) to ask questions of any Cigna representative prior to the review; and (5) to question any reviewer at the review; and (6) to be assisted or represented by a person of their choice. For required pre- service and concurrent care coverage determinations, the review will be completed within 15 calendar days. For post service claims, the review will be com pleted within 30 calendar days. If more time or information is needed to make the determination, Cigna will notify the Insured Person in writing to request an extension of up to 15 calendar days and to specify any additional information needed to complete the review.

The Insured Person will be notified in writing of the decision within five working days after the decision is made, and within th e review time frames above if Cigna or the Committee does not approve the requested cov erage. The Insured Person may request that the appeal process be expedited if the time frames under this process: (a) would seriously jeopardize the Insured Person's lif e, health or ability to regain maximum function or, in the opinion of your Physician would cause severe pain which cannot be managed without the requested services; or (b) the appeal involves non- authorization of an admission or continuing inpatient Hospit al stay. If the Insured Person requests that the appeal be expedited based on (a) above, the Insured Person may also ask for an expedited external Independent Review at the same time, if the time to complete an expedited internal appeal would be de trimental to the Insured Person's medical condition. Cigna's Physician reviewer, in consultation with the treating Physician will decide if an expedited appeal is necessary.
