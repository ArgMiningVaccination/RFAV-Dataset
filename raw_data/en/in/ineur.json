I love the use of plants to heal the body! Provides natural ingredients. It helps arrhythmic heartbeat if you have lack of potassium. I find it safe although I take only 2 or 3 capsules a day. I have been using the Potassium Phyto Vitamins for a couple years now to control water retention that I have for a couple medical conditions. I could not live without it. I just received this product and I love that there are no additives like Magnesium Stearate added. To soon to tell about it's effectiveness, but I think I will be happy with it, It's difficult to find vitamins without all kinds of additives such as magnesium stearate (which supposedly makes capsule ingredients from getting stuck to the encapsulation machine), etc. These vitamins are pure, safe and effective.

By following these three steps, you will get the best results. If you are new to organic vitamins, alkaline body balance, or herbal supplements, start slowly. Take 1 capsule per day and monitor your body's reaction. You can then slowly increase the serving size of 2 to 4 capsules per day depending on your requirements. Keep in mind that you can always reduce your serving size and/or skip a day until you become accustomed. Certain formulas may have a cleansing action on the body. In some cases, this could be a good thing and should not be considered as a negative reaction. A natural supplement must be used in conjunction with lifestyle changes and will take longer than chemical equivalents. In some cases, even chemical equivalents may take months for measurable results. These natural products are intended as an alternative holistic health option, rapid results are not implied or guaranteed. Remember that herbal remedies are not medicines. In some cases, a health condition may have taken years to manifest itself and it would be unrealistic to expect results within a few weeks or even months. Please consult your alternative health practitioner and/or health practitioner and/or doctor if symptoms persist.
