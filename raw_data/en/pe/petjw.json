It can feel like a dull ache, a burning sensation, or a sharp, stabbing [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm). The pain could be constant or intermittent and mild to severe. It could be accompanied by [stiffness](https://www.medicinenet.com/joint_stiffness/symptoms.htm), swelling, or [weakness](https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm) in the affected area. The following are most commonly susceptible to musculoskeletal pain: - Neck - Back - Shoulders - Hips - Legs - Hands, wrists, elbows, and [feet](https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm) These areas are particularly susceptible to pain because they are used for a wide range of activities and movements and are often subject to strain and overuse. Additionally, many people experience pain due to underlying health conditions, such as [arthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm) or [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://www.medicinenet.com/carpal_tunnel_syndrome/article.htm). What are the common signs and symptoms of musculoskeletal pain? Musculoskeletal pain can cause several signs and symptoms. They may vary among people. Usually, people describe the pain as a body ache or pain in pulled or overworked muscles. Common signs and symptoms of musculoskeletal pain - Aching or stiffness in the affected area - Swelling or tenderness in the affected area - Limited range of motion in the affected joint or area - Difficulty moving the affected body part - Muscle weakness or spasms - Redness or warmth to the touch in the affected area - Tingling or numbness in the affected area - Pain that worsens with movement or activity - Pain that is relieved by rest [Fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm)or general malaise - Difficulty sleeping due to pain - Unable to lead an independent life In older people, pain could be chronic, lasting for several weeks. What are the common causes of and risk factors for musculoskeletal pain? Common causes of musculoskeletal pain - Overuse or repetitive strain injuries, such as [tennis elbow](https://www.medicinenet.com/tennis_elbow_lateral_epicondylitis/article.htm)or [carpal tunnel bone](https://www.medicinenet.com/broken_bone_types_of_bone_fractures/article.htm) - Degenerative conditions, such as [osteoarthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoarthritis/article.htm)or stenosis - Inflammatory conditions, such as [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/rheumatoid_arthritis/article.htm)or - Infections, such as [osteomyelitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/osteomyelitis/article.htm)or [septic disorders, such as Paget's disease or [osteoporosis](https://www.medicinenet.com/osteoporosis/article.htm) - Neoplasms or tumors, which affect the musculoskeletal system - A symptom of [fibromyalgia](https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_facts/article.htm)or [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_fatigue_syndrome/article.htm)or other medical conditions Risk factors for musculoskeletal pain Musculoskeletal pain can affect people of all ages, regardless of their activity levels. Certain groups of people could be at a higher risk of developing this type of pain, including: - Older adults: Muscles and bones may weaken due to age, increasing the risk of injury and pain. - Athletes and physically active people: Engaging in regular physical activity can put extra strain on the muscles and bones, which can lead to pain and injuries. - People with certain medical conditions: Some medical conditions, such as [arthritis](https://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)and [fibromyalgia](https://www.medicinenet.com/fibromyalgia_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), can cause chronic musculoskeletal pain. - People with sedentary lifestyles: Lack of physical activity can lead to weak muscles and bones, increasing the risk of musculoskeletal pain. - People who perform repetitive tasks: Repeating the same movements repeatedly, such as typing on a keyboard or using tools, can lead to pain in the muscles and joints. - Genetics: Some people could be more likely to experience musculoskeletal pain due to their underlying genetic factors. - Previous injuries: If a person has previously injured a muscle, bone, or joint, they could be more likely to experience pain in that area. - Poor posture: Poor posture can strain the muscles, bones, and joints and lead to pain. [Obesity](https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm): Being [overweight](https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm)or [obese](https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm)can strain muscles, bones, and joints and increase the risk of musculoskeletal pain.
