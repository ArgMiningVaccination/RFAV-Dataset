Policy Overview Based on the CMS National Coverage Determination (NCD) coding policy manual, services that are excluded from coverage include routine physical examinations and services that are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. CMS interprets these provisions to prohibit coverage of screening services, including laboratory tests furnished in the absence of signs, symptoms, or personal history of dise ase or injury. A national coverage policy for diagnostic laboratory test(s) is a document stating CMS's policy with respect to the circumstances under which the test(s) will be considered reasonable and necessary, and not screening. Reimbursement Guidelin es This edit will allow clinical diagnostic lab procedure(s) when submitted with a diagnosis code found on the allowed diagnosis code list. When the clinical diagnostic lab procedure is billed as a routine screening service, as evidenced by the diagnosis cod e not found on the allowed diagnosis code list, the procedure code will deny.

Copyright 20 23 United HealthC are Services, Inc. 2023R8100A Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), a tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of the prostate, can predict residual tumor in the post-operative phase of prostate cancer. Three to 6 months after radical prostatectomy, PSA is reported to provide a sensitive indicator of persist ent disease. Six months following introduction of antiandrogen therapy, PSA is reported of distinguishing patients with favorable response from those in whom limited response is anticipated. PSA when used in conjunction with other prostate cancer tests, s uch as digital rectal examination, may assist in the decision -making process for diagnosing prostate cancer. PSA also, serves as a marker in following the progress of most prostate tumors once a diagnosis has been established. This test is also an aid in t he management of prostate cancer patients and in detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients following treatment. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (CPT code 84153), when the claim indicates a code fo und on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test.

ICD-10 Codes approved Bacterial A bacterial urine culture is a laboratory procedure performed on a urine specimen to establish the probable etiology of a presumed urinary tract infection. It is common practice to do a urinalysis prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of the evaluation and management of another related condition. The procedure includes aerobic agar - based isolation of bacteria or other cultivable organisms present, and quantitation of types present based on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed s ignificant may be subjected to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Urine Culture, Bacterial (CPT codes 87086 and 87088), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test.

For ICD-10 Codes approved with CPT code 87086 and 87088 (Urine Culture, Bacterial), see the Attachment Section. Serum Iron Studies Serum iron studies are useful in the evaluation of disorders of iron metabolism, particularly iron deficiency and iron excess . Iron studies are best performed whe n the patient is fasting in the morning and has abstained from medications that may influence iron balance. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. In young children on a milk diet, iron deficiency is often secondary to dietary deficiency. In adults, iron deficiency is usually the result of blood loss and is only occasionally secondary to dietary deficiency or malabsorption. Following major surgery, the patient may have iron deficient erythropoietin for months or years if adequate iron replacem ent has not been given. High doses of supplemental iron may cause the serum iron to be elevated. Serum iron may also be altered in acute and chronic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is an indirect measure of trans ferring, a protein that binds and transports iron. TIBC quantifies transferring by the amount of iron that it can bind. TIBC and transferring are elevated in iron deficiency, and with oral contraceptive use, and during pregnancy. TIBC and transferring may be decreased in malabsorption syndromes or in those affected with chronic diseases. The percent saturation represents the ratio of iron to the TIBC.

Copyright 20 23 United HealthC are Services, Inc. 2023R8100A Assays for ferreting are also useful in assessing iron balance. Low concentrations are associated with iron deficiency and are highly specific. High concentrations are found in hemosiderosis (iron overload without associated tissue injury) and hemochromatosis (iron overload with associated tissue injury). In these conditions the iron is elev ated, the TIBC and transferrin are within the reference range or low, and the percent saturation is elevated. Serum ferritin can be useful for both initiating and monitoring treatment for iron overload. Transferrin and ferritin belong to a group of serum proteins known as acute phase reactants and are increased in response to stressful or inflammatory conditions and also can occur with infection and tissue injury due to surgery, trauma, or necrosis. Ferritin and iron/TIBC (or transferrin) are affected by a cute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and in patients with these disorders, tests of iron status may be difficult to interpret. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Serum Iron Studies (CPT codes 82728, 83540, 83550, and/or 84466), when the cl aim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test.

ICD-10 Codes approved with A Proprietary information of UnitedHealthcare Community and State . Copyright 20 23 United HealthC are Services, Inc. 2023R8100A ICD-10 Codes approved are a class of heterogeneous particles of varying sizes and densities containing lipid and protein. These lipoproteins include cholesterol esters and free cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and A, C, and E apoproteins. Total cholesterol comprises all the cholesterol found in various lipoproteins. Factors that affect blood cholesterol levels include age, sex, body weight, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, exercise, g enetic factors, family history, medications, menopausal status, the use of hormone replacement therapy, and chronic disorders such as hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, pancreatic disease (including diabetes), and kidney disease. In many individua ls, an elevated blood cholesterol level constitutes an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Blood levels of total cholesterol and various fractions of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) are useful in assessing and monitoring treatment for that risk in patients with cardiovascular and related diseases. Blood levels of the above cholesterol components including triglyceride have been separated into desirable, borderline, and high -risk categories by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in their report in 1993. These categories form a useful basis for evaluation and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. Therapy to reduce these risk parameters include s diet, exercise and medication, and fat weight loss, which is particularly powerful when combined with diet and exercise.

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will not reimburse when the treatment rendered is without inclusion of one of the and ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes being included o n the claim accurately reflecting the member's condition. For ICD-10 Codes see the Attachment Section. Thyroid Testing Thyroid function studies are used to delineate the presence or absence of hormonal abnormalities of the thyroid and pituitary glands. These abnormalities may be either primary or secondary and often but not always accompany clinically defined signs and symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction. Laboratory evaluation of thyroid function has become more scientifically defined. Tests can be done with increased specificity, thereby reducing the number of tests needed to diagnose and follow treatment of most thyroid disease. Measurements of serum sensitive thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complemented by determination of thyroid hormone levels [free or total thyroxine (T4) with Triiodothyronine (T3) uptake] are used for diagnosis and follow -up of patie nts with thyroid disorders. Additional tests may be necessary to evaluate certain complex diagnostic problems or on hospitalized patients, where many circumstances can skew tests results. When a test for total thyroxine (total T4 or T4 radioimmunoassay) or T3 uptake is performed, calculation of the free thyroxine index (FTI) is useful to correct for abnormal results for either total T4 or T3 uptake due to protein binding effects. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Thyroid Testing (CPT codes 844 36, 84439, 84443, and 84479), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test.

Copyright 20 23 United HealthC are Services, Inc. 2023R8100A Prothrombin Time (PT) Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few simple laboratory tests: the Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), Prothrombin Time (PT), Thrombin Time (TT), or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PT test is one in -vitro laboratory test used to a ssess coagulation. While the PTT assesses the intrinsic limb of the coagulation system, the PT assesses the extrinsic or tissue factor dependent pathway. Both tests also evaluate the common coagulation pathway involving all the reactions that occur after t he activation of factor X. Extrinsic pathway factors are produced in the liver and their production is dependent on adequate vitamin K activity. Deficiencies of factors may be related to decreased production or increased consumption of coagulation factors. The PT/INR is most commonly used to measure the effect of warfarin and regulate its dosing. Warfarin blocks the effect of vitamin K on hepatic production of extrinsic pathway factors. A PT is expressed in seconds and/or as an international normalized rat io (INR). The INR is the PT ratio that would result if the WHO reference thromboplastin was used in performing the test. Current medical information does not clarify the role of laboratory PT testing in patients who are self-monitoring . Therefore, the indi cations for testing apply regardless of whether or not the patient is also PT self -testing.

ICD-10 Codes approved with CPT code 86301 intracellular enzyme that appears in blood following leakage from cells. Renal tubules, liver, and pancreas contain high amounts, although the measurement of GGT in serum is almost always used for assessment of Hepato biliary function. Unlike other enzymes which are found in heart, skeletal muscle, and intestinal mucosa as well as liver, the appearance of an elevated level of GGT in serum is almost always the result of liver disease or injury. It is specifically useful to differentiate elevated alkaline phosphatase levels when the source of the alkaline phosphatase increase (bone, liver, or placenta) is unclear. The combination of high alkaline phosphatase and a normal GGT does not, however, rule out liver disease comple tely. As well as being a very specific marker of Hepatobiliary function, GGT is also a very sensitive marker for hepatocellular damage. Abnormal concentrations typically appear before elevations of other liver enzymes or biliuria are evident. Obstruction of the biliary tract, viral infection (e.g., hepatitis, mononucleosis), metastatic cancer, exposure to hepatotoxins (e.g., organic solvents, drugs, alcohol), and use of drugs that induce microsomal enzymes in the liver (e.g., cimetidine, barbiturates, phen ytoin, and carbamazepine) all can cause a moderate to marked increase in GGT serum concentration. In addition, some drugs can cause or exacerbate liver dysfunction (e.g., atorvastatin, troglitazone, and others as noted in FDA Contraindications and Warnings .) GGT is useful for diagnosis of liver disease or injury, exclusion of hepatobiliary involvement related to other diseases, and patient management during the resolution of existing disease or following injury.

Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel This panel consists of the following tests: Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM antibody; Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and; Hepatitis C antibody. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses, drugs, toxins, and other etiologies. Viral hepatitis can be due to one of at least five different viruses, designated hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Most cases are caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). HAV is the most common cause of hepatitis in children and adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a positive IgG anti -HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti -HAV, which typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears within three months of its appearance. IgG anti -HAV is similar in the timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection indicates prior effective immunization or recovery from infection. Although HAV is spread most comm only by fecal -oral exposure, standard immune globulin may be effective as a prophylaxis. HBV produces three separate antigens (surface, core, and e (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel. Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel: hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) -IgM antibody. HBsAg is the earlier marker, appear ing in serum four to eight weeks after exposure, and typically disappearing within six months after its appearance. If HBsAg remains detectable for greater than six months, this indicates chronic HBV infection. HBcAb, in the form of both IgG and IgM antibo dies, are next to appear in serum, typically becoming detectable two to three months following exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or disappears entirely one to two years following exposure, but the IgG usually remains detectable for life. Becaus e HBsAg is present for a relatively short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does not exclude an HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a much higher titer and remains elevated for a longer period of time, but a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be the result of a prior infection. The last marker to appear in the course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appears in serum four to six months following exposure to infected blood or body flui ds; in the U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30% to 60% of new cases of HBV infection. The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is best established by documentation of positive IgM antibody against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established primarily by identifying a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG antibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgG). Additional tests such as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope antigen and antibody, are not included in the hepatitis panel, but may be of importance in assessing the infectivity of patients with HBV. Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAb alone may be used monthly for up to six months, or until a positive result is obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response. HCV is the most common cause of post -transfusion hepatitis; overall HCV is respo nsible for 15% to 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodies, which appear in blood two to four months after infection. False positive HCV r esults can occur. For example, a patient with a recent yeast infection may produce a false positive anti -HCV result. For this reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively throug h exposure to infected blood or body fluids.

When the time o f exposure or the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued sympto ms of liver disease despite a completely negative hepatitis panel may need a repeat panel approximately two weeks to two months later to exclude the possibility of hepatitis.

After changes in dosages or the addition of a medication that could affect the digoxin level, it is reasonable to check the digoxin level one week after the change or addition. Based on the clinical situation, in cases of digoxin toxicity, testing may need to be done more than once a week. Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of p atients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and for reduction of the ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.

ICD-10 Codes approved with A Proprietary information of UnitedHealthcare Community and State . Copyright 20 23 United requires regular determinations of blood glucose levels. Glycated hemoglobin/protein levels are used to assess long -term glucose control in diabetes. Alternative names for these tests include glycated or glycosylated hemoglobin or Hgb, hemoglobin glycated or glycosylated p rotein, and fructosamine. Glycated hemoglobin (equivalent to hemoglobin A1) refers to total glycosylated hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, usually determined by affinity or ion -exchange chromatographic methodology. Hemoglobin A1c refers to the major component of hemoglobin A1, usually determined by ion -exchange affinity chromatography, immunoassay, or agar gel electrophoresis. Fructosamine or protein refers to glycosylated protein present in a serum or plasma sample. Glycated protein refers to m easurement of the component of the specific protein that is glycated usually by colorimetric method or affinity chromatography. Glycated hemoglobin in whole blood assesses glycemic control over a period of 4 -8 weeks and appears to be the more appropriate test for monitoring a patient who is capable of maintaining long -term, stable control. Measurement may be medically necessary every 3 months to determine whether a patient's metabolic control has been on average within the target range. More frequent asses sments, every 1 -2 months, may be appropriate in the patient whose diabetes regimen has been altered to improve control or in whom evidence is present that intercurrent events may have altered a previously satisfactory level of control (for example, post -major surgery or as a result of glucocorticoid therapy). Glycated protein in serum/plasma assesses glycemic control over a period of 1 -2 weeks. It may be reasonable and necessary to monitor glycated protein monthly in pregnant diabetic women. Glycated hemogl obin/protein test results may be low, indicating significant, persistent hypoglycemia, in nesidioblastosis or insulinoma, conditions which are accompanied by inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. A below normal test value is helpful in establishing the patient's hypoglycemic state in those conditions.

The testing of a person to rule out or to confirm a suspected diagnosis because the patient has a sign and/or symptom is a diagnostic test, not a screening. Questions and Answers Q: What is a National Coverage Policy? A: A national coverage policy for diagnostic laboratory test(s) is a document stating CMS's policy with respect to the circumstances under which the test(s) will be considered reasonable and necessary, and not screening, for Medic are purposes. Such a policy applies nationwide. A national coverage policy is neither a practice parameter nor a statement of the accepted standard of medical practice.
