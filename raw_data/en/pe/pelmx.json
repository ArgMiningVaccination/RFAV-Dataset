Chakra Healing When you think of the effects that food has on your body, it's likely that you immediately think of the physical impacts; through conscious food choices, you can incorporate food into your diet that might help you lose or gain weight and/or muscle. But your food choices don't just affect your physical self; they have a profound impact on your mental, emotional, and spiritual self as well. In fact, your mind, body, and spirit are all affected every single day by your food intake in ways that you may not even see. That's why intentionally choosing food that works with your internal energy is so important: because the effects extend beyond your physical self and digestive system and have an impact on your entire well-being. Below, you'll find a list of healing foods for each of your body's energy centers along with a handy chart you can print or save to your phone. If you want to connect with a particular chakra, incorporate foods into your snacks and meals that correspond with that chakra. Be intentional with this practice. For instance, if you're connecting with your root chakra and decide to add sweet potatoes to one of your meals, set the intention to connect with your root chakra before you start eating. As you eat, remain mindful of the energy in and around your root chakra. You might also internally recite some root chakra affirmations as you're eating. (You can find links to affirmations for each of your body's energy centers in the sections below.)
