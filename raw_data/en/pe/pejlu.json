Listen to our weekly [Dharma Podcast at this link](https://www.upaya.org/dharmatalks/). |May 2023 Upaya COVID-19 Protocol Update| |Dear Friends, | It has been over three years since the beginning of the pandemic, during which Upaya has been closed to the public and has gone almost entirely online for our daily zazen practice, retreats, and training programs. During this time, we supported a few in-person residential programs, requiring strict quarantine protocols and policies. In addition, our staff and resident body have been small in order to meet these challenging circumstances. Late last year, we began opening up carefully and slowly, inviting a few practitioners into the zendo with masks and other precautions, as well as hosting several small, in-person retreats with quarantine protocols, vaccination requirements, masking, etc. In all this time we have been fortunate to have very few cases of COVID-19, and we deeply thank the Upaya resident body and local practitioners over these years for their care and conscientiousness. Now, with the CDC determining that transmission rates are low for COVID-19 across the country, (as well as recently declaring the official \"end\" of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency), we feel it is time for us to cautiously open our doors a bit more and begin to rebuild our staff and in-person programs while also continuing to support our dedicated global Cloud Zendo Community through online zazen and hybrid (online and in-person) programs. On May 24, the use of masks will be optional for in-person practice in the Upaya Zendo and for programs. We will also not require proof of vaccination or quarantine before entering Upaya. You are, of course, very welcome to wear a mask when you attend our events and programs. We also request that you not come to Upaya if you have flu or Covid symptoms, until you are symptom free and you test negative for Covid. We do ask that incoming residents and program participants please wear a mask when traveling through airports and on airplanes, and exercise caution when in crowds or large groups of people, keeping in mind that if someone develops symptoms of COVID-19 or flu once they are at Upaya, they will be asked to return home, or if we have space, to quarantine, and test for COVID-19. If you have a condition that impairs your immune system or if you are over the age of 75, we recommend that you wear a mask. If you have fever, chills, cough, sneezing, runny nose, or a new rash, take appropriate care of yourself and do not come to Upaya until you have tested negative (in the event that you have COVID-19) and are fully recovered. We also do not want to bring colds or flu into the community. If you have been exposed to COVID-19 recently, attend only after five days since exposure and a negative test. Anyone at Upaya may still choose to wear masks or N95s. Please respect their decision. Please be aware that if community transmission of COVID-19 or flu return to CDC high or substantial levels, we will return to mandatory masking and other requirements. Staying up-to-date with vaccines remains the most important way to prevent the serious complications from COVID-19. Note that Upaya at this time is only hosting small groups. We suggest early registration. Please join us for Online Zazen (7:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. MT) and Wednesday Dharma Talks (5:30 p.m. MT), on [Upaya "}
