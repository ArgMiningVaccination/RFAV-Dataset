The exciting part of this method is that it is easy to learn and practise at home. Anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. The [Surviving Cancer Compendium](http://drsircus.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=25b08cc8b5ebaf472984d04d0&id=6ab27a75aa&e=daf6acb368) contains a turnkey cancer treatment program that can be implemented by any patient, practitioner, clinic, spa or hospital. This compendium is like an army field hospital set-up guide for patients who want to treat themselves in the comfort of their own home. I consult and teach people how to do this in desperate situations no matter where they live with the compendium being the textbook and reference guide. The compendium is 2,500 pages long. It sets a new precedent in cancer information and care. Treating cancer effectively is difficult, since most orthodox therapies do not discriminate between cancer cells and healthy ones. Because Natural Allopathic Medicine does not employ the use of poisons, it effectively discriminates between us and the enemy. There is no killing of one's own troops (cells) when we win the war against cancer the natural way. Natural Oncology is an offshoot of integrative or holistic oncology. The natural way is not necessarily the easy way. One of the main reasons mainstream medicine is so attractive, no matter how dangerous and no matter how much it hurts, is because we do not have to do anything; they do it to us. In my opinion, the price is too high and the risk is too great in using toxic chemo or radiation. However, even for those who have already been treated with chemo and radiation there is the big challenge of surviving the toxic aggression of these treatments. The big mistake that oncologists make is to not inform their patients what to do to take care of themselves while they are exposed to toxic treatments. Patients have to take care of themselves before, during and after chemo, radiation; this compendium gives people that information. However, these treatments not only supplement but replace what the mainstream offers, but for many it takes extreme courage to turn away from their mainstream oncologists, no matter how uninformed and misguided they are. So Many Reasons not to use Poisons Children who survive cancer treatment face increased heart health risk and should take measures soon after life-saving therapy to reduce the risk of serious problems later in life. While earlier research had shown that childhood cancer survivors face heart disease and other potentially serious health problems decades after treatment, a new study found that chemotherapy during childhood takes a toll on artery health, leaving them vulnerable to premature atherosclerosis and heart disease. My work in medicine is dedicated to the children who suffer the most under modern oncology. We do not have to harm patients to cure them. Chemotherapy in general is an unsound idea, though we will discover that there are natural forms of chemotherapy, such as medical marijuana, which may be more effective without the often crippling side effects. When you take a closer look at our medical system, there are certain therapies that physicians are allowed to use, and alternative therapies that they are not allowed to use. The choices have nothing to do with what is right or wrong, safe or dangerous. Money controls too many decisions and then there is the power of control. Doctors risk losing their licence to practice medicine if they use 'alternative' methods. Almost all of the best alternative cancer practitioners of the past and present have received some sort of backlash from the medical establishment. The medical industrial complex's official position is that alternative methods have not received proper testing. A closer examination will reveal that it is almost impossible to get proper funding and acceptance to carry out official testing on cheaper safer alternative methods. Books can be written about the corrupt nature of modern medicine with all their studies, journals, tests and FDA stamps of approvals that all add up to the creation of a deadly industrial medical complex that has the habit of killing a lot of people each year. The government is not being truthful about the environment and how our children and we are being poisoned by heavy metals, chemicals, pesticides and radiation, which is increasingly becoming a threat after the catastrophic accident at Fukushima. And they certainly are not telling anyone how poisonous our pharmaceutical medicines are and how they are polluting our water supplies because we urinate and dispose of them right into the environment. The only therapies accepted are the expensive ones that have patents from pharmaceutical companies. If money cannot be made to compensate pharmaceutical companies for their 'synthetic' drugs, they may not approved for testing. Big money cannot be made on natural cancer fighting substances because they are ineligible for patents. If your decision is to trust the medical establishment for your cancer care, I wish you a lot of luck because you are going to need it. Natural Allopathic Medicine and Cancer A big part of this compendium is about the fulfilment of nutritional law. We all need nutrition to stay alive; that includes nutritional substances like oxygen and carbon dioxide. In fact, nothing will find a person either dead or extremely ill quicker than a strong reduction in the blood of either gas. Iodine, magnesium, selenium, bicarbonate, sulphur, water and light from the sun are all basic nutritional elements that keep us healthy or cure us through the fulfilment of nutritional law. Some things we can do without or with little for a while, but in general, when we want to recover from cancer, it is wise to feed a person all the high-octane nutritional elements a person needs. Natural Allopathic Medicine goes beyond the food as your medicine concept in several ways. First, it redefines food to include the primary gasses of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and it includes light and water, which means not only more oxygen but also hydrogen, which is not usually thought about. Secondly, what we do when we practise Natural Allopathic Medicine is to concentrate most of these basic nutritional elements so each reaches its full potential to bring healing to the body's tissues. If you can imagine a ramjet, and how concentrating oxygen and fuel would increase the healing burst and movement forward in a positive direction, you will get the general philosophy and principles we will be dealing with. Understanding nutritional law is important but it is not the only aspect of life that matters to a cancer patient. How our physical bodies are interacting and reacting with the environment and with one's own mind, emotion and spirit matters as much as anything we do on a physical level. Stress is a key element for all cancer patients to deal with because it touches down on all of these levels that matter to us including how our immune system functions to get rid of cancer. Not too many doctors or patients are aware of the clear fact that when one does not exercise properly one will become deficient in carbon dioxide. Exercise is wonderful and healthy because during exercise we produce sufficient carbon dioxide, which increases oxygen circulation and delivery. How important our sexualities are for healing and how much stress we carry from this area of our lives also escapes most doctors and patients. In the section on breast and prostate and other sexual organ cancers, we look closely at sexual and emotional issues, which are universal to all people. We have to turn over every stone when we attempt to cure ourselves of cancer and there certainly are plenty of stones we need to turn over. In the end we will even find that love is nutritional too for it is as necessary as anything else to our wellbeing.
