Choose a mantra or affirmation that resonates with you and reflects your spiritual intention. It could be a simple phrase like \"I am connected to my higher self\" or \"I am open to divine guidance\". Repeat this mantra or affirmation silently or aloud during your meditation practice, allowing its positive vibrations to permeate your being and align you with your higher self. - Mindfulness and Presence: Practice mindfulness by bringing your full attention to the present moment. Observe your thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judgment.

This practice helps quiet the mind and create a space for connecting with your higher self. - Guided Meditations: Guided meditations are valuable tools for spiritual meditation, especially for beginners.
