In 2008, Alameda County adopted positions on numerous legislative matters; a recap of these is attached (Attachment 1). A number of State and federal legislative issues of importance to Alameda County are currently pending, and will be pursued again as part of the 2009 Legislative Program. The 2009 Legislative Program is the result of many months of effort by Board offices, County agencies/departments, our State and federal legislative advocates, and others. Proposals were reviewed by the Personnel, Administration and Legislation (PAL) Board Committee on January 12,2009 and are hereby forwarded to your Board for approval. The proposals are categorized as follows: County Sponsored (State), County Proposals (State), County Proposals (Federal) and Federal Earmark Funding Requests. Within the overall context of the County's Legislative Program, it continues to be essential that the question of restructuring local government finances be addressed. In addition, the current State and federal economic crisis makes it more critical than ever before to pursue all available revenue opportunities for County programs and services, as well as look creatively at ways to continue to provide adequate levels of program services with massive funding cuts, the impact of which is still unknown beyond the $10 million in cuts the County has absorbed already as a result of the 2008-09 Final State Budget. The 2009 Alameda County Legislative Program serves as a foundation. As new legislative proposals are developed or additional issues surface during the legislative session, amendments to the 2009 Legislative Program will be considered by the PAL Board Committee and by your Board. Please find a summary of the County's 2008 legislative positions in Attachment I and the Executive Summary in Attachment II for a brief description of each proposal included in the 2009 Legislative Program. Finally, the proposed federal earmark requests are included in Attachment III. Very trul y yours, ~ Susan S.

Health Care Access and Affordability 23 2009 STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS I. COUNTY SPONSORSHIP A. SAFE NEEDLE DISPOSAL LEGISLATION (Supervisor Keith Carson) The County seeks sponsorship of legislation to increase the safe disposal of hypodermic needles and lancets, otherwise known as \"sharps.\" While in previous legislative sessions, Alameda County has successfully sponsored two pieces of \"safe needle disposal\" legislation, current law does not regulate the mass generators of these needles: the pharmaceutical industry. Every year more than 2 billion needles and syringes are used nationwide outside of health care settings (i.e. at home). These \"at-home\" injectors are people with diabetes and patients receiving home health treatment (i.e., allergies, infertility, multiple sclerosis, HIV, Hepatitis B & C, arthritis, etc). Many of these self-injectors are unaware of safe disposal methods available to them and simply throw their used needles in the trash posing a risk of injury and potential infection from diseases such as Hepatitis B or C and mv. The improper disposal of these needles poses serious health risks to children, workers, and the general public. Due to recent legislative efforts, to simply throw these needles in the trash is now illegal, yet an estimated 1 million Californians must self-inject prescription medications annually to treat a broad range of serious health problems. It is estimated that these 1 million Californians generate more than 389 million sharps per year. The number of people with diabetes continues to grow at epidemic rates and is expected to increase even more due to rising obesity rates. The use of injection devices is an effective method of prescription drug delivery and is expected to increase significantly in the future. However, the increased use of injection devices will generate more home generated sharps each year. The Legislature has found that sharps mail-back programs utilizing containers and packaging approved by the United States Postal Service offer one of the most convenient means for collecting and destroying home-generated sharps and that the cooperative efforts of the pharmaceutical industry is needed to develop a safe needle disposal system for California. Supervisor Carson's office proposes that the County sponsor a bill during the 2009 legislative session that amends the Health & Safety Code so that pharmaceutical manufacturers whose product is dispensed 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 1 in California via an injection device be responsible for providing their patient/client with a safe needle disposal method. II. COUNTY STATE PROPOSALS A. HEALTHCARE SERVICES AGENCY 1. Health Inequities/Chronic Diseases Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department, Health Care Services Agency Discussion/Analysis: In Alameda County there are race/ethnicity disparities in premature deaths, incidence of disease, and health care access or utilization. With few exceptions, African Americans have significantly higher rates of deaths and disease than the other racial and ethnic groups and do not meet most of our nation's health goals for selected indicators. In fact, Alameda County African Americans have met the national health objectives for only 2 of 16 health indicators established as part of the national Healthy People 2010 objectives. Because of these inequities, legislative solutions are needed in the following areas: Nutrition and Physical Activity -The three leading causes of death in Alameda County are diseases of the heart, cancer, and stroke. This is consistent across all racial and ethnic groups with the exception of Native Americans. However, African Americans die from these diseases at a significantly higher rate than all other racial/ethnic groups. Individual factors such as unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity as well as social and environmental factors are major causes of all of these diseases as well as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and osteoporosis. In the past three decades, the prevalence of overweight has tripled in children ages 6 to 11 and doubled in adolescents ages 12 to 19 in the United States (source: National Center for Health Statistics. Health, United States, 2004 with chartbook on trends in the health of Americans. Hyattsville, MD: 2004.). On average, 30 percent of California's children are overweight. Almost half of the children and adolescents now diagnosed with diabetes have the Type 2 form of the disease, which is strongly linked to obesity and lack of exercise. One in four obese children has early signs of Type 2 diabetes. Overweight and physical inactivity costs California an estimated $24.6 billion annually, approximately seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) per person. Unless this rapidly increasing problem of unhealthy eating and physical inactivity is addressed, the costs and consequences associated with the obesity epidemic will also continue to increase at an alarming rate. Legislative solutions that could begin to address this problem include: Mandatory physical education in schools K-12 -Daily participation in physical education classes by California high school students dropped from 42% in 1991 to 27% in 1997. Many children do not participate in physical activity because it is not accessible or affordable. Currently, physical education is only required for two of the four years of high school. Increased physical education time in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) will also impact the quality of movement that children and youth receive during the school day. Promote the initiation and prolonged duration of breastfeeding -Breastfeeding has been proven to provide a broad range of health benefits to both baby and mother including reducing a child's chance of becoming overweight or obese. Efforts to encourage and support breastfeeding are necessary to develop a foundation of good health. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 2 Limit the marketing of junk food to children -The Institute of Medicine recently issued a comprehensive list of recommendations to combat the obesity crisis, including the creation of guidelines to limit the marketing of junk food to children. In recent years this kind of marketing has exploded adding fuel to this growing epidemic. Improve utilization of food assistance programs -The complexity of applying for and maintaining eligibility for food assistance programs is frequently a barrier to low-income families. Efforts to simplify these procedures to increase enrollment in the Food Stamps, Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and subsidized meal program in schools, should be undertaken. Only 56% of eligible people receive Food Stamps in Alameda County. The California Food Policy Advocates and America's Second Harvest outlined the problem in their studies \"Knocking Down Barriers\" and \"The Red Tape Divide: State-by-State Review of Food Stamp Applications\" respectively. Legislation to simplify Food Stamp application process and eligibility would increase participation in the program. Expand the availability of healthy foods in low-income communities. Healthy and nutritious foods must be made more easily available in low-income neighborhoods. Greater accessibility will facilitate efforts to reduce obesity and related diseases. While the State will be implementing a pilot program that provides assistance, it should be expanded and greater financial incentives and/or assistance should be provided to retailers to bring about the needed changes. Tobacco -Smoking kills 41,000 Californians every year. The California Air Resources Board declared secondhand smoke a toxic air contaminant in January 2006, and the U.S. Surgeon General declared in June 2006 that there is no safe level of second-hand smoke. Almost 500,000 California children 18 years of age or younger are projected to die from smoking related disease. Additionally, regular exposure greatly increases a child's chances of premature births, low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or developing asthma, lung infections, and damage to lung function. The Public Health Department supports provisions to protect persons from secondhand smoke exposure, provisions that strengthen local laws to reduce youth access to tobacco products, and provisions that reduce or eliminate the retailing of new tobacco or nicotine products. Asthma -Asthma is a chronic disease that causes inflammation in the airways. It is the leading cause of hospitalizations for children under age 5. Alameda County has the second highest rate of asthma hospitalizations in the State. ACPHD supports policies that create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities, especially those that eliminate the disproportionate burden of asthma for people living in poverty and people of color. This goal can be achieved through optimizing the diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma by adherence to the current National Heart Lung and Blood Institutes asthma guidelines; expanding the reach of proven case management programs for serving persons with asthma; utilizing community health workers and trained professionals; improving air quality and reducing diesel emissions in our communities. 2. Disaster Preparedness and Public Health Infrastructure Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department, Health Care Services Agency Proposal: Improve the County's preparedness for any form of disaster or event, by addressing and prioritizing the following systems to enhance skills and capacity in these functional service areas: 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 3 Surveillance and epidemiology Public health laboratories Communications systems (interoperable systems) Pharmacy needs Emergency medical services Training and coordination of disaster service workers Training and coordination of health care personnel and volunteers Credentialing system Emergency medication/vaccination dispensing sites Current Law/Status: The experience of several hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and wildfires in California clearly demonstrated the need to ensure that we have systems in place in Alameda County to respond in a timely manner to a natural or manmade disaster. The Public Health Department is currently working in collaboration with other county, State and Federal agencies, local hospitals and clinics, and other institutions to strengthen our communications and responsiveness. However, without a reinforced Public Health infrastructure, an adequate long-term health response to future possible natural disasters, along with bioterrorism threats, will become increasingly more difficult. Discussion: The following proposals will ensure that our State and local disaster response systems are adequately prepared to respond in the case of an emergency crisis situation: Promote public health workforce development - A qualified public health workforce is needed to staff our frontline response to natural disasters and to potential biological threats. However, an estimated 43% of the State's public health workforce could be lost in the next couple of years due to retirements and other factors. Legislation to promote the recruitment and retention of new public health professionals to replace our aging workforce should be supported. Improve communication between disparate organizations and levels of government Clear leadership at the State level provided by the creation of a State Department of Public Health should promote this kind of communication. In addition, regional planning must take place to create communications systems that will be functional in a mutual aid response situation. Additional funding may be needed to support such systems. Develop systems to ensure that services can be delivered in a timely and efficient manner \u00ad Special consideration needs to be given to serving vulnerable and special needs populations. As seen in Hurricane Katrina, pre-planning for disaster response must be focused on those who will be least able to help themselves in the event of a large-scale public health emergency. Support a statewide credentialing system -Develop and implement a statewide identification system for clinicians (doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, etc) and government employees that are qualified and trained to respond to a disaster in a specific set of skills. Each individual would have an identification badge to allow access to secure areas. This system could be administered by a statewide agency such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or Sheriffs Department, who should be able to provide such services. This would allow a uniform, seamless integration of support staff for mutual aid responses, plus it would necessitate the creation of a statewide data system where individuals with specialized skills could be queried and requested depending on the type of event. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 4 Support a statewide volunteer database -Develop and implement a volunteer database similar to the credentialing system above that would have a system in place for volunteers that would be pre\u00ad screened to be able to assist in the event of a disaster. Support legislation which promotes funding opportunities for pre-disaster mitigation -Pre\u00ad disaster mitigation is especially important around protecting first responders, safety net and public health infrastructure so that California can respond to all disasters without being vulnerable. For example, retrofitting fire stations and hospitals is needed so that the buildings will not be damaged in earthquakes. Prioritize no cost or low cost training opportunities that promote skill development -The State should promote a system to ensure all appropriate government, first responder, first receiver staff and other professionals are adequately trained in preparedness and response systems, communication and specialized targeted skills, where appropriate. Fiscal Impact: To address all of these needs, a significant infusion of funds and increased collaboration will be needed. However, this must be balanced against the cost of not investing in the public health infrastructure should there actually be a disaster of some kind in the Bay Area. The Public Health Department proposes identifying federal dollars designated for combating bioterrorism and/or addressing natural disasters to address these county health needs. 3. Health Care Access and Affordability Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Discussion/Analysis: Healthcare in the United States is a patchwork of programs and services -some subsidized, some free. Our healthcare network is cobbled together via federally-funded programs that provide limited free medical care to low-income Americans; payments by local governments to hospitals for indigent care; fee-based community and county clinics; free care donated by physicians; and private and employer-provided insurance. This network allows the insured, underinsured, and uninsured to get limited medical care. However, accessing comprehensive, specialized, affordable health care is a challenge for increasing numbers of Americans. The Uninsured The U.S. Census Bureau reported a decline in the number of people without health insurance coverage from 47 million (15.8 percent) in 2006 to 45.7 million (15.3 percent) in 2007. The number of uninsured children declined from 8.7 million (11.7 percent) in 2006 to 8.1 million (11.0 percent) in 2007. But in October 2008 the Kaiser Family Foundation projected that the current economic downturn and rising unemployment rate likely will cause the number of uninsured to grow by at least 2 million in 2008. In California, 6.6 million residents (or about 19%) were without health insurance from 2006-2007. Roughly 1.2 million California children do not have health insurance, despite the state's efforts in the past two years to expand government-sponsored plans for lOW-income kids. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 5 The percentage of people covered by private health insurance was 67.5 percent, down from 67.9 percent in 2006. The percentage of people covered by employment-based health insurance decreased to 59.3 in 2007 from 59.7 percent in 2006. By race/ethnicity in the U.S., 32 percent of Hispanics, 20 percent of African Americans, and 17 percent of Asians were uninsured in 2007. Among non-Hispanic whites, 10.4 percent were uninsured. Race/Ethnicity in California: 31% 0 f Hispanics are not insured; 19% of Americans; 12% of whites. Race/ethnicity 33% of Hispanics; 21 % of Blacks; 15% of Asians and almost 7% of whites lack access to healthcare By immigration in Alameda County: 26.4% of non-citizens and 12.6% of naturalized citizens lack healthcare access. The Underinsured According to Health Access California: Uninsured and underinsured families too often avoid getting the care they need, resulting in devastating health impacts. One report showed that uninsured adults in California are far less likely to go to the emergency room (12.1 % had at least one visit) than those on private insurance (20.8%) or public programs (32.9%). Uninsured families who go to the hospital for needed care are often charged exorbitant rates, often much higher than the rate for fully insured patients. Large medical bills are often sent to collection agencies, ruining a family's financial future. A Harvard study indicates that illness and medical bills cause nearly half of all personal bankruptcies. Families are rarely notified of the financial options that exist, from public insurance programs to the hospitals' own charity care policies. One fifth (21 %) of working-age adults both insured and uninsured currently have medical debt. Proposals Single payer/ universal health coverage. Combine individual mandates and subsidies with required employer contributions for a single payer or universal system. Support federal and state proposals aimed at continuous and universal access to affordable health care for all. Increase Medi-Cal provider rates. Medi-Cal provider rates continue to erode and fail to reflect true medical costs. Declining reimbursement rates, such as the temporary 10% reduction approved in 2008, are compromising the health care safety net that many poorer residents depend on. Certain specialties have limited or no new access (e.g. dental, orthopedics). Provider rates must be increased to stem the number of providers opting out of Medi-Cal participation. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 6 Streamline public health insurance enrollment. Enhanced application assistance and system navigation with attention to language and cultural competencies will aid consumers in better understanding and using appropriate health services. Eliminate mid-year eligibility review and provide one year of extended continuous coverage for health insurance enrollment (which is what it was before this budget year). Support SCHIP reauthorization. The federally-funded State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) supports California's Healthy Families Program, which provides low-cost health coverage to more than 850,000 children in families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to afford private coverage. Federal SCRIP funding expires March 31,2009. Support State funding of undocumented health care. Ensure the provision of preventive health and health care services to undocumented individuals to protect their health, the health of the public at large, and to prevent more costly health care costs that may ensue if these individuals do not get appropriate and prompt care. Maintain health coverage during budget gaps. In 2008, it took 85 days to adopt the California state budget. During that delay, seniors, disabled children and adults were left without health services as service providers dealt with insufficient or zero funding. Improve/enforce statutes governing California's budget process to eliminate devastating impacts on vulnerable populations. This would ensure consistent financial support to persons dependent on health and social services. Expand Employer Coverage of Dependents/Insure single adults. The Urban Institute notes that nationally, only 27.8% of young adults ages 19-26 have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Adult males who are unemployed are most likely to be uninsured. Require employers to allow parents to cover their children up to age 26 as dependents. Support affordable health care options (private or employer based) for these groups. 4. Violence Prevention Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department, Health Care Services Agency Proposal: Violence is preventable. Alameda County supports legislation that funds and addresses root causes of all forms of violence. We consider violence to include intimate partner violence, family violence, gun violence, gang violence, suicide and homicide, police and prison guard violence, youth violence, hate violence, sexual assault, child and elder abuse. Gun violence has been a particularly difficult problem in Alameda County. Between 2003-2005, 75.3% of homicide victims were killed by firearms. Alameda County's homicide rate from 2003-2005, in addition to exceeding the statewide rate, was almost three times higher than the national Healthy People 2010 objective of 3 or fewer homicides per 100,000 people. Moreover, African Americans and Latino men are disproportionately affected by violence. For example, the homicide mortality rate for African American men between 2003-2005 was 76 and for Latino men it was 11, whereas for white men it was 3. Given the complexity of issues, policies and systems that promote or prevent violence, success requires an action plan that coordinates, supports, and strengthens a range of efforts. The goals of this platform are four-fold: 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 7 1) To decrease the presence of risk factors that contribute to violence and increase the presence of resilience factors that are protective against violence at the individual, family, and community levels. 2) To increase accountability for violence prevention related outcomes, foster violence prevention leadership in the State, increase coordination of violence prevention efforts, and enhance understanding of effective violence prevention approaches, programs, and policies. 3) To decrease the level of all forms of violence throughout the State over time. 4) To reduce the disproportionate representation of people of color as victims of violence. Discussion/Analysis: Violence is an issue that impacts all sectors of our community. Alameda County has adopted a Violence Prevention Blueprint which frames its commitment to primary prevention strategies which address root causes and risk factors for violence. Among the aims stipulated within the Blueprint is to build community capacity as a strategy for preventing these problems and to increase resiliency when these problems do occur. Alameda County supports legislation that funds and addresses root causes of all forms of violence. Alameda County opposes most legislation that focuses solely on suppression strategies that do not ameliorate root causes and risk factors unless they are balanced by primary prevention support. The following recommendations are designed to achieve the goals of this proposal: Promote positive child and youth development Young people need skills and supports that will enable them to negotiate potentially volatile situations, form strong attachments and relationships, participate in their schools and communities in a meaningful way, and have hope for the future. Providing these supports and opportunities is vital for both short-term and long-term reductions in violence. To this end, all young people should have access to violence prevention skills development, mentoring, positive environments, meaningful activities, career path opportunities, and trauma reduction assistance. Ensure supported and functioning families\u00b7 Families are a cornerstone in the community and it is through family interaction that values, beliefs, and norms are instilled into our society. All families in Alameda County should have access to interdisciplinary programs that help maximize effective parenting and decrease family violence. Foster safe and vibrant neighborhoods -Recommendations for achieving safe and vibrant neighborhoods include the following: 1) Firearms: Reduce the availability and usage of firearms. 2) Conflict resolution: Create pro-active dispute resolution structures and support at the neighborhood and school level. 3) Gang prevention: Reduce gang violence through appropriate services, programs and outreach to those at risk of gang participation and to those already involved. The focus should be on ameliorating the root causes and risk factors of gang violence and not focused solely on suppression strategies. 4) Alcohol availability: Decrease the density of alcohol outlets and advertising. 5) Restorative justice: Implement remedial rather than punitive justice programs with community organizations and the justice system. 6) Reentry: Create more viable connections between communities and detention facilities, through A) 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 8 incentives for hiring formerly incarcerated persons, B) support transItIon from detention to the community through physical and mental health services, substance abuse treatment, job training and employment services, and C) supports for family members. 7) Employment: Promote job training and placement programs as well as the creation of living wage jobs. 8) Physical environment: Improve the physical appearance of neighborhoods by fostering arts programs and community gardens, improving park, school, and neighborhood maintenance, improving lighting and removing graffiti and blight. 5. Alcohol Policy Principles Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Proposal: The ACPHD proposes the adoption of the principles discussed below in order to reduce alcohol\u00ad related problems and foster the development of healthy communities. The ACPHD anticipates the introduction of related state legislation in the future, to which the department will respond based on these stated principles. Present Law: Current law and regulation provide valuable tools that can be used to develop strategies for changing many high-risk environments in which alcohol and other drugs are used. This \"environmental\" approach to AOD prevention focuses on changes in laws, public policies and social norms to reduce and prevent problems related to the use of alcohol and other drugs. The principles noted below, when applied through actual legislative changes, will enhance the ability of concerned community and neighborhood groups to reduce and prevent alcohol and other drug related problems. Discussion: ~ Reduce the Social Availability of Alcohol to Youth: The availability of alcohol to youth through social sources, including parents, older siblings, or teen parties, must be reduced or eliminated. Social host liability laws, which subject adults providing alcohol to persons under the age of 21 to civil action and hold them accountable for injuries that occur as a result of underage drinking, represent a means of achieving this goal. ~ Eliminate Targeting of Youth for Alcohol Advertising: It is currently very difficult for parents and other adults to control a youth's exposure to alcohol advertising, marketing, and promotions, which frequently associate alcohol use with success, attractiveness, and popularity. ~ Reduce the availability of alcohol products targeted to youth market: Alcohol products such as flavored malt beverages, with their colorful packaging and fruity sweet flavors, are targeted to the underage youth, particularly young girls. Marketing the products as \"malt\" beverages, despite their being primarily distilled spirits, has allowed them to be advertised on TV, and sold in convenience stores, small markets and other \"beer and wine\" stores. ~ Renew Efforts to Deter Alcohol-Impaired Driving: In California alcohol involved fatal collisions have increased 23.8% and alcohol involved persons killed have increased 23.5% within the last five years (1999-2003). Nationally a similar trend has been seen with a 37% increase in alcohol-impaired driving from 1997 to 1999, where it has stayed as of 2002, despite safer cars and highways. Policies 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 9 ---~------~-- to deter alcohol-impaired driving include; lowering the legal blood-alcohol levels, prompt suspension of a driver's license for people arrested, expanded sobriety checkpoints, alcohol-ignition interlock programs, and sustained health education that includes efforts to reduce binge drinking. ~ Reduce the Overconcentration of Alcohol Sales Establishments in Neighborhoods. Promote a balanced environment of retail sales activities in neighborhoods, and reduce the dependence on alcohol sales for revenue. A high concentration of retail alcohol licenses in communities is considered a risk factor for youth growing up in that environment. There is a correlation in Alameda County of health inequities in neighborhoods with a high concentration of alcohol establishments. Public health research has consistently linked high crime and violence rates to high concentrations of alcohol licenses. Policies that can reduce the current number of licenses, or number of problem licenses, and/or limit new licenses from being placed in neighborhoods already over-concentrated should be supported in order to reduce health inequities and to improve the health, safety and quality of life in our communities. Additionally it is important that policies at the State and local level be based on a long-term plan for alcohol retailers that is consistent with smart growth standards. 6. Reducing Inequities in HIV Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Discussion/Analysis: HIV/AIDS impacts many communities in Alameda County. As of December 2006, a total of 7,064 AIDS cases were reported to the ACPHD epidemiology surveillance unit. 2,968 (42%) are People Living with HIV/AIDS. Proposals: ACPHD supports the following items that promote and allow programs for comprehensive reproductive health education in school settings, provide health education and risk reduction strategies for individuals engaging in risky behavior, and increase funding for services for HIV+ individuals. Furthermore, the ACPHD supports Federal Re-Authorization of the Ryan White Treatment Modernization Act of 2006, which is due to sunset in 12/10, unless there is new legislation introduced that would re\u00ad authorize the bill or propose new legislation for care services. In addition, the ACPHD recommends that the U.S. must develop a comprehensive National AIDS Strategy to achieve improved and more equitable outcomes from our domestic response to HIV/AIDS. Needle Exchange Programs: Injection drug use is the second leading cause of HIV transmission and the leading cause of hepatitis C infection in California. The link between injection drug use and HIV in California is particularly strong for women and people of color. In Alameda County, injection drug use accounts for 24% of all AIDS cases among African Americans and 35% of all AIDS cases among women. Studies of needle exchange programs have repeatedly shown that these efforts are successful in reducing the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C while showing no increase in the use of injection drugs. Current law requires that a county, through their Board of Supervisors, authorize the exchange of clean hypodermic needles and syringes as part of a network of comprehensive services, including treatment services. Alameda County first authorized needle exchange program services in December 1999. AB 110 was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and became effective January 1,2008. The bill authorizes local health jurisdictions that receive State General Fund money from the California 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 10 Department of Public Health, Office of AIDS for the purposes of HIV education and prevention to use the money for the purchase of sterile hypodermic needles and syringes if certain conditions are met. This law repeals a ban on using state funds to purchase clean needles and syringes for distribution by needle\u00ad exchange programs. Local and state funding of such programs is legal, but California previously prohibited the use of state grants to purchase needles for the programs. Needle-exchange programs are still ineligible for federal funding. The ACPHD supports federal legislation that would permit a county receiving federal awards for mv prevention to use those funds to support needle exchange programs, authorized by the county, to purchase sterile hypodermic needles and syringes. The ACPHD also supports permanent status for California Senate Bill 1159 \"Pharmacy Syringe Sale and Disease Prevention Demonstration Project.\" This bill is slated to sunset on December 31, 2010. It has been proven highly effective in providing increased access to clean syringes when someone is not able to get to a syringe exchange site. In Alameda County, more than seventy pharmacies have enrolled in this program. Comprehensive Reproductive and Sexual Health Programs for Teens o National and statewide teen birth rates (births per 1000, females ages 15 -19) have been on the decline since 1991. In 2006 U.S. teen birth rates increased for the first time since 1991. Our county rate has increased over 9% in the past two years (2005 -2006). The Latina teen birth rate (66.1) is over ten times higher than the Asian rate (6.4) and six times higher than rates among Whites (10.3). African American rate for teen births (51.6) is eight times higher than the Asian rate (6.4) and five times higher than rates among Whites (10.3). The highest rates of teen births are in East and West Oakland, and among foreign born teens. o The number of some Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) in young women under the age of 20 is almost equivalent to the numbers reported for all other women over the age of 20. This illustrates the high levels of unprotected sexual activity occuning in this population, creating greater opportunities for mv transmission. o Current AIDS data reflects that young people 13 -19 represent .4% of the cases. As our federal entities are promoting abstinence only-based education, it is important to fund comprehensive reproductive and sexual health programs which stress abstinence, while also educating young people about contraception, family communication, responsible negotiating and decision making skills. Condom Distribution and HIV Testing in Jails and Prisons: At present, the distribution of condoms is prohibited within the County jail and State and federal prisons. Rates of many diseases are higher for the incarcerated than for the total US population. Among the incarcerated, rates of HIV are 8-10 times higher. Kate Monico Klein, Director of the San Francisco Forensic AIDS Project, recently reported that 2% to 5% of the 2,100 inmates jn the five San Francisco County jails are HIV+. (Kaiser Daily AIDS Report, 12/20/06) Given the prolonged rates of incarceration and the cyclical nature of the system, many inmates are not equjpped to access health services when released. When HIV and other STDs are not prevented during incarceration, nor diagnosed in a timely manner, a greater transmission risk is incurred for their community partners. Condom distribution and routine, non-mandatory, mv testing should be allowed in jails and prisons in order to prevent the spread of these diseases within the inmate population and among their partners in the community. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 11 7. Community-Based Systems of Care for Seniors and Persons with Disabilities Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Discussion/Analysis: Our most vulnerable populations -people with disabilities and seniors -rely on systems of care that are also fragile in their own respect. Community programs serving these populations are generally under-funded and have very high tum over of support staff due to low wages. The need for competent and reliable support workers is increasing due to the rapidly expanding population of seniors and people with disabilities. The number of people over 65 in the United States will soar to 71.5 million by 2030 -one out of every five Americans, and the number of people with disabilities is also increasing faster than the general population. Furthermore, these systems of care can be greatly impacted by disruptions in streams of funding. The life and safety of our most vulnerable populations are in jeopardy every year there is a delay in the signing of the State Budget. When providers are not receiving their funding, there is little or nothing to fall back on and services become jeopardized causing great risk to consumers. Institutional living is not the desired future of any individual, yet our system of care for these populations is to offer nursing homes or mini-institutions as an entitlement and community waivers as an alternative. Society and legislation must come to realize that all people, regardless of age or severity of disability, should be entitled to conditions, which foster their development and participation in their community. Yet about two-thirds of Medicaid long-term care expenditures are used to fund nursing homes and only one\u00ad third on home and community-based services. The direct support staffing crisis in community services and the institutional bias of the Medicaid reimbursement system reduces people's quality of life, leads to a degradation of independent living skills, forces unnecessary institutionalization, and often leaves people in perilous situations. Legislative Proposal: Goals: 1) Increase the community's capacity to offer all types of supportive services (i.e., supported living, assistive living, rent subsidies, in home supportive services, educational services, day programs, supported employment, recreation and socialization) and access to quality health care as a first line of service offerings. 2) Change regulations as needed to make community living the first service option. 3) Increase the competence and retention of direct support workers providing integrated community services and supports. Objectives and recommendations Reduce barriers to the ability of people with disabilities and seniors to remain in their own homes and communities by developing affordable accessible housing, expanding assisted or supported living 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 12 options, and establishing integrated service coordination (for populations where this does not currently exist) for navigating the multiple service systems that provide needed home-based services. Improve wages and benefits for paraprofessionals (direct service) who work with people with disabilities & seniors. Support efforts to improve the recruitment, retention, and training of paraprofessionals (direct service) who work with people with disabilities & seniors. Support federal legislation that would remove the institutional bias of Medicaid funding, by mandating an expansion of home services and having money follow the person out of institutions. 8. Universal Development Screening. Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Discussion/Analysis: The practice of developmental screening is widely endorsed but minimally utilized in the busy day-to-day practice of the average pediatrician. An estimated 5 to 10% of the pediatric population has a developmental disability. Most recently, the CDC has stated that 1 out of every 150 children will have a diagnosis of autism. The current strategy to identify these children is through developmental surveillance, a continuous procedure in which the health professional observes the infant, takes a developmental history, and elicits any concerns that the caregiver might have. However, identification of children with a developmental delay is ineffective when based solely on routine surveillance. A necessary adjunct is developmental screening: the process of systematically identifying children with suspected delay, which need further assessment. Screening tests greatly improve the rate of identification. Identification is essential for intervention. Early and appropriate intervention can be the key to greater independence, increased participation in the wider community, and ultimately, a more productive and fulfilling life as an adult. Without early identification through screening, a child may not receive the early and intensive interventions he or she needs. Furthermore, the cost of lifelong care can be reduced with early diagnosis and intervention Legislative Proposal: ACPHD proposes early identification of developmental delays that can help to mitigate disabilities in the long run and greatly improve children's outcomes. We need to institute the process of universal developmental screening for all children ages 12 to 36 months. Goals: 1) To decrease late identification of developmental delays (after the age of three years) 2) To increase the number of pediatricians who utilize validated screening tools and offer routine developmental screening exams to children ages 12-36 months across all languages and cultures 3) To ensure that health care providers are reimbursed for the added expense through their medical provider group, or other reimbursement processes. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 13 Objectives and Recommendations: Incorporate developmental screenings into the existing pediatric periodicity schedule by substituting at least one developmental/behavioral screening visit for a well-child visit in children between 12 and 36 months of age; or Utilize trained parent-interviewers at pediatric clinics that could perform the developmental screenings. (Parents could be notified by the end of their office visit if the screening results warrant further assessment or referrals to a developmental specialist.) The form could also be sent home in advance of their visit and they could bring the completed form into the well-child check up. 9. Promote a Healthier Built Environment Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Proposal: The ACPHD proposes policies that foster the health and well being of individuals and communities by supporting and developing a healthier built environment. Such legislation would seek to reduce the use of car trips, prevent displacement, reduce pollution, improve access to public transportation, improve safety, increase the supply of affordable housing, make communities walkable, bikeable, and increase access to parks, green space, grocery stores, and farmers' markets. These efforts will increase physical activity, improve access to nutritious foods, reduce asthma rates and chronic disease rates, reduce motor vehicle collisions and pedestrian deaths and injuries, reduce environmental exposures, make communities safer, strengthen community interaction, and improve housing conditions, supply, and affordabili ty. Discussion/Analysis: The \"built environment\" refers to the human made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity, such as roads, buildings, sidewalks, farms, or parks. Over the past few years public health professionals have begun to understand the powerful impact the built environment has upon health choices and outcomes, and planners have started to comprehend the strong correlations between what makes a well-designed community for design's sake and what makes a well-designed community for health's sake. In particular, there is a growing recognition of how the built environment has impacted the obesity epidemic in this country. A major factor in our expanding waistlines is a built environment that implicitly discourages physical activity while encouraging the consumption of greater quantities of energy-dense, low\u00ad nutrient foods. Risk factors include an absence of grocery stores or access to healthy fresh foods in low\u00ad income neighborhoods, a concentration of low-quality, nutrient-poor junk food in convenience stores, liquor stores, or fast food establishments, and conditions that discourage walking by not providing sidewalks, adequate lighting, or safe crosswalks across busy streets. In addition to obesity, there are additional links to be made between the built environment and health. Road design and the location of polluting industries affects air quality and thus rates of asthma and other lung diseases. Street design and traffic congestion can make pedestrians vulnerable to traffic injuries and death. The placement of jobs and services away from homes decreases opportunity for social interaction, creates a greater reliance on air polluting cars, and decreases community cohesion while increasing stress. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 14 It is also well established that environmental contaminants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disabilities and developmental delays. To combat these unhealthy built environment impacts, the ACPHD supports policies and legislation that would: Require a public health element in or public health language throughout all general and regional plans. Require inclusionary housing policies, which require mixed-income housing development. Prevent the displacement of people during redevelopment. Increase access to grocery stores, farmers' markets, and other sources of fruits and vegetables throughout communities. Limit access to liquor, tobacco, and unhealthy food outlets. Locate higher density housing near rail and bus lines. Reduce toxic emissions and chemical exposures. Increase funding for parks and trails. Support access to and affordability of public transit. Develop programs that increase pedestrian and cycling mobility, reduce car trips, and calm traffic. Promote the use of universal design to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities. Adopt the Ahwahnee Principles in policy and planning, which are a set of principles that take a more holistic and healthier approach to planning communities. B. SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY 1. Simplify Eligibility Process for Minor Consent California Code of Regulations Section 50147.1 provides that a minor may, without parental consent, receive services related to sexual assault, pregnancy and pregnancy related services, family planning, sexually transmitted diseases, drug and alcohol abuse, and outpatient mental health treatment and counseling. This proposal would eliminate the monthly face-to-face requirement for Minor Consent Limited Services, and allow continuous eligibility for twelve months. This change would simplify the eligibility process for Minor Consent Beneficiaries who are required to certify eligibility each month prior to receiving Minor Consent Limited Services. These individuals, under the age of 21, must meet in-person with a county eligibility worker to complete the Request for Eligibility for Limited Services, MC 4026 Form. An exception to the monthly certification requirement is allowed for a child applying for Medi\u00ad Cal, on the basis of a need for mental health services, which requires recertification when new treatment is required. There would be no change in the requirements for Minor Consent Mental Health Services. Under this proposal, the Request for Limited Services, MC 4026 would be completed at intake and only when a status change occurs, such as a person moves out of their parent or guardian's house, gets married, starts or quits working, obtains property such as bank accounts, automobile, stocks, bonds, trust funds or gives birth or ends pregnancy. In addition to identifying the type of Minor Consent Limited Services needed at intake, the eligibility worker would inform the applicant of the annual renewal requirement and stipulate that all status changes must be reported in-person. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 15 Currently, a Minor Consent applicant must complete a Medi-Cal application form MC 210 or MC 219 and Form Request for Limited Services a MC 4026 in-person at intake and again each month prior to receiving services. When an annual renewal is required, a new Medi-Cal Application (an MC 210 or MC 219) must also be completed. The eligibility worker is required to take necessary precautions to maintain the confidentiality by not sending the Beneficiary Explanation of Medi-Cal Benefits Statement to the parent's home. Recognizing that monthly certification limits access to essential health care services, it is imperative that unnecessary and costly paperwork be eliminated. Recent attempts by the Governor to impose a monthly certification for immigrants seeking Medi-Cal limited services were rejected by the Legislature. California's 2008-09 Budget enacted a midyear status-reporting requirement for children to receive Medi-Cal; however, Minor Consent beneficiaries are exempt from the midyear requirement 2. Assessment Center The Children's Assessment Center is open 23 hours a day and is a countywide three-site program that allows frontline Child Protective Service (CPS) workers to bring children to a safe, child-oriented setting when they have been removed from their homes. Multi-disciplinary teams of professionals who conduct preliminary assessments of the children staff the Center. Its core function is to provide an appropriate environment that provides the time and resources needed to make a full assessment and the most appropriate placement decision for each child. Appropriation funding will go towards much of the operating facility costs and towards the cost of the child care contract. C. CHILD CARE PLANNING COUNCIL 1. Child Care Administrative Mechanisms The Child Care Planning Council opposes any changes to the subsidized child care system that would make it harder for low income families to receive assistance. Current income eligibility thresholds already are too low and don't reflect the challenges of living in high cost areas of the state like Alameda County. Also, parent fees are already high enough that they can dissuade parents from earning higher wages. We must oppose further limitations to child care subsidies because they are a crucial support for low-income working families. 2. Child Care for Working Families The Child Care Planning Council opposes any cuts to direct and indirect state funded child care programs. The current subsidized child care system is fragile enough, and almost 5,000 children are waiting for financial assistance but cannot receive it due to lack of funds. Direct state-funded providers are struggling to break even with reimbursement rates that do not recognize regional cost of living differences and lack of funding during a budget impasse. Indirect state-funded agencies provide crucial support to the system, helping parents find child care and helping the state target child care to the neediest areas and helping providers improve their professional development. Child care in and of itself is an economic engine in our state economy-generating an estimated $4.7-$5.4 billion statewide in revenue in 2001, 123,000 California based jobs, and enabling parents to work. We must preserve this system to help ensure the recovery of California's economic health. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 16 ADDITIONAL ITEMS 1) Support increased revenue-generating options and efficiency measures to meet the budget shortfall including support for efforts to rescind the 2/3 vote requirement to pass a budget and/or raise revenues. 2) Support efforts to reauthorize and increase funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Head Start, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, Community Development Block Grant, Social Services Block Grant, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and federal resources targeted to Higher Education for early care and education providers. III. COUNTY FEDERAL PROPOSALS A. PUBLIC WORKS AGENCY 1. Castro Valley Boulevard Pedestrian Enhancement Project ($10M) A Strategic Plan was recently adopted for the Castro Valley Downtown area which identified streetscape improvements as well. The streetscape improvements are necessary to redefine the downtown area into a pedestrian oriented retail area. Castro Valley Boulevard serves a dual role as both a bypass to 1-580 and a commercial district. The amount of traffic along Castro Valley Boulevard has resulted in an unfriendly walking/shopping environment. Implementation of the streetscape improvements will convert Castro Valley Boulevard into a walkable, pedestrian oriented environment. This project would include reduced lane widths, traffic calming measures; e.g., (bulb-outs), landscaping, street-scaping, artwork, and wider sidewalk areas. (The Agency is currently working on design of project -could be advertised in 24 months). This project is a high priority for the Castro Valley community for revitalizing the downtown business. It is interdependent upon the completion of several regional projects to reduce congestion related bypass traffic in the downtown area. 3. Federal funding for Coliseum BART to Bay Trail Connector ($4.5M) The Bay Trail is a planned 400-mile continuous biking and hiking path encircling San Francisco Bay. This project would link the Oakland Coliseum BART station to the Martin Luther King, If. recreational shoreline. Two hundred and thirty miles of Bay Trail have been developed. However, there are significant portions that have not been completed. This project will connect a gap in the City of Oakland between the Oakland Coliseum, the 66th Avenue BART station, and the Martin Luther King, If. Regional Shoreline. The Coliseum BART to Bay Trail Project has the potential to connect bicyclists and pedestrians with BART, Amtrack, and AC Transit, as well as increase public access to the Bay Trail. Funding could be used in 2009 or 2010. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 17 4. Crow Canyon Road Safety Project ($4.5M) There is one location on Crow Canyon Road which the County has targeted for realignment due to the number of collisions related to the sharp curvature of the roadway. The estimated cost to realign this curve to improve traffic safety is $15 million. The County will continue to seek (state) STIP funding for this project but these funds are not likely to be available for several years. In the interim, the County will seek federal monies for final design, federal/state environmental clearance (NEPA), and right of way acquisition ($I.5M for DesignlEnvironmental; $3M for right of way). This funding strategy would allow the County to advance the project and have it ready for construction when funds become available. The County has completed a corridor study and preliminary environmental studies and is proceeding with preliminary engineering. Crow Canyon Road serves as a two-lane major regional route between Contra Costa County and Alameda County carrying approximately 25,000 vehicles per day. Because there is a significant travel time savings in using Crow Canyon Road verses 1-680 and 1-580 during commute hours when the freeways are congested, many commuters choose to travel on Crow Canyon Road as a commute alternative. Crow Canyon Road was not designed to carry this high volume of traffic at freeway speeds. As a result, there have been numerous collisions on the roadway. Major engineering improvements are required to address long term, rapidly-escalating safety issues on this roadway for both commuters and residents along Crow Canyon Road between Castro Valley and San Ramon. 5. East 14thIMission Boulevard Revitalization Project ($15M) East 14th StreetlMission Boulevard is a high pnonty redevelopment project for the Ashland and Cherryland areas of unincorporated Alameda County. The Ashland and Cherryland areas are economically challenged communities served by the retail corridor of East 14th StreetlMission Boulevard. Revitalization of this retail corridor will stimulate the area by attracting new businesses and lead the way to regeneration of the entire area. In this section, please provide a thorough analysis of your recommended proposal. Phase one of three has been constructed and has made a significant area improvement. However, design and construction funding for the remaining two phases is lacking. (Substantial funding is still needed). 6. East Lewelling Boulevard Circulation and Streetscape Improvement Project Phase II ($9M) East Lewelling Boulevard is an arterial roadway that connects major commercial corridors Hesperian Boulevard and Mission Boulevard. This roadway has significant traffic congestion and a lack of sidewalks and requires safety improvements for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. Phase I of the project between Hesperian Boulevard and Meekland Avenue is scheduled for construction in summer of 2009. A concept plan was developed for Phase II when Phase I was studied. The County wants to proceed with the Design, Environmental clearance, and right of way acquisition tasks (estimated project costs: $IM DesignlEnvironmental and $2M for right of way) to be ready for construction when funds become available. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 18 The East Lewelling Boulevard Circulation and Streetscape Improvement Project (Phase II) is located along East Lewelling Boulevard between East 14th Street and Meekland Avenue. This project will construct median islands, sidewalks, bicycle lanes and install landscaping along the project. (upon securing funding, the project could be advertised in 24 to 30 months). 7. Fruitvale Bridge Lifeline Seismic Retrofit Project ($3M) Since the City of Alameda is an island, it is dependent upon four bridges and two tubes for access. In the event of a catastrophic seismic event, one facility needs to be upgraded to a lifeline status so that supplies and services can be provided to the City of Alameda in case all other bridges are significantly damaged. The County wants to proceed with the Design and Environmental clearance (estimate: $3M) so that this project is construction ready when funds become available. The County conducted a study of the estuary bridges between the Cities of Alameda and Oakland to identify the most feasible bridge for lifeline seismic retrofitting. The best candidate and most cost effective bridge for lifeline retrofitting is the Fruitvale Avenue Bridge. The estimated cost of the project is approximately $40M. While the feasibility study has been completed, monies for design and construction of the lifeline improvements are still required. The County will seek both (state) STIP and HBP funding for this project although the high cost of the project will make it difficult to obtain complete funding. Federal funding for this important regional project would help leverage limited local area monies for the project. 8. Hesperian Boulevard Pedestrian Safety and Enhancement Project ($5M) Hesperian Boulevard is a major commercial corridor through the San Lorenzo area. Unfortunately, it also serves as a major arterial along the 1-880 corridor. The result is that the amount of traffic along Hesperian Boulevard divides the San Lorenzo community in two. A Streetscape master plan has been developed and is in need of funding for implementation. Two phases of the project are currently under design and should be constructed in the next two to three years. The remaining portion between Hacienda Avenue and Via Mercado remain unfunded and could be designed and constructed easily with funding. The improvements would facilitate a safer and more walkable environment by improving sidewalk areas, providing applicable traffic calming such as bulb\u00ad outs, provide landscaping and streetscape improvements, and gateway improvements. These improvements would reduce the impact of the diverted freeway traffic thus allowing Hesperian Boulevard to serve as a major arterial and a community functional roadway. (Project could be delivered in 18 months). This is a high priority project in the San Lorenzo community. It is part of a regional bypass corridor to 1-880 extending between the City of Hayward, through Alameda County, and into the City of San Leandro. 9. Funding for 1\u00b7580 HOV Lanes Project ($600M) The 1-580 corridor in the Tri-Valley is one of the most traffic congested in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area region. It serves as a key inter-regional gateway between the Bay Area and the 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 19 Central Valley for goods movement and commute workforce travel. This chronic condition has resulted in 1-580's designation in the top five most congested corridors identified in the annual report jointly published by Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). This condition will be exacerbated with traffic projected to increase 90 percent by 2030 in this corridor. To respond to the existing and projected congestion, the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (CMA) has identified a series of planned improvements for this corridor. These include: implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); construction of HOV lanes in the eastbound and westbound direction with future conversion to SMARTIHOT lanes; interchange improvements that include building a new interchange at Isabel in Livermore and reconstruction of the existing 1-580/1-680 interchange; auxiliary lanes; and truck climbing lanes in Livermore. Complementing the road projects is the environmental clearance to preserve the corridor for future transit. ITS implementation is currently underway. Cost estimates for the HOV lanes including the Isabel interchange are $450 million. Estimates for the 1-580/1-680 interchange range from $450 million to $1 billion. Approximately $100 million is needed for truck climbing lanes. MTC has submitted the HOV lanes project to the State for funding from the recently approved transportation bond with a decision expected by the end of February. Funding for construction of remaining phases of road improvements has not yet been identified. 10. School Safety Projects ($6M) The unincorporated areas of Alameda County have over $400 million in needed sidewalk improvements to promote community pedestrian safety near schools. As a result, the County has developed a prioritized list of sidewalk projects using factors such as school proximity, high pedestrian generators, and accident history with the ultimate goal of improving safety conditions for pedestrians and children surrounding school areas. The County has identified Sidewalk projects immediately adjacent to schools that have been constructed or are under design. While these projects have helped by providing sidewalks so that school children do not have to walk in the street, there are still many routes without sidewalks where children must walk in the street to avoid parked cars or puddles. The estimated unit cost for sidewalk installation is approximately $600,000/1000 feet of sidewalk on both sides of a street. Sidewalk projects may be broken into smaller segments and designed and constructed as funding is made available. The County's priority remains providing safe and walkable access for children on the way to school, access to transit to encourage use of public transportation alternatives, and walkable neighborhoods for seniors. 11. Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Plan ($500K) The Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Plan will develop and examine future transportation alternatives along the Union Pacific Railroad Corridor between the Fruitvale BART station in the City of Oakland and the Union City BART station in the City of Union City. The Corridor is Approximately 15 miles long. The Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Study will develop and examine future transportation alternatives (pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and rail) along the Union Pacific Railroad Corridor between the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland and the Union City BART station in the City of Union City. The Corridor is approximately 15 miles long. This planning effort provides 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 20 opportunity to convert the railway corridor into a multi-use access that benefits area residents and enhances transportation options for local communities. 12. Funding for Vasco Road Project -Phase II ($17M) This request is for funding for continued Vasco Road improvements. The proposed continuation of the project (Phase II) will realign the roadway and install a median barrier southerly of the current project for approximately one mile. The estimated cost of the Phase II project is $17M. Funding hasn't been established but the County will seek future funds including (state) STIP and TVTC. Federal funding would help expedite design and environmental clearance of the project to improve the overall project's construction readiness. The County has completed the utility relocation component of the safety improvement project between mile posts 3.0 and 4.3 and has commenced with construction of the roadway realignment project. Due to a history of severe collisions on the roadway, Phase II includes the installation of a median barrier to further protect motorists from crossover head-on collisions. A federal appropriation received for the project was instrumental in the delivery of the project. This project will extend Phase I improvements which are also being incorporated into Contra Costa County Vasco Road projects. 13. Arroyo de la Laguna Soil Erosion Restoration Projects ($1.5M) The Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation DistrictJPublic Works Agency is supporting the efforts of Alameda County Resource Conservation District (Natural Resources Conservation Service) and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission in their efforts to seek additional federal funding for soil erosion restoration projects for the Arroyo de la Laguna watershed. Continued Federal Funding for Arroyo de la Laguna Soil Erosion Restoration Projects: The Phase One proposal of the restoration (completed in 2006) was to develop a pilot project to 1) Demonstrate use of Farm Bill's Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program in an urban creek to engineer and construct bioengineered stream restoration in a critical section of the Arroyo, and 2) Illustrate how local community and agencies at all levels and other co-sponsors can restore and protect urban creeks in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner. To continue to improve additional segments of this wildlife habitat with further restorative projects to be implemented in additional phases, the County is seeking $1,750,000 in additional funding from the federal government Department of Agriculture as well as continued partnerships with state and local government resources and stakeholders to continue with this important restoration. The $1,750,000 project budget breakdown is as follows: Planning: $ 27,000 (Site Selection, practice selection) Engineering: $ 72,000 (includes design and survey) 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 21 Pennitting: $ 35,000 (includes Agency Fees, Monitoring) ACRCD Admin: $ 28,000 (Contracts, Billing, Audits) Education/Outreach: $ 38,000 (Includes Monitoring) Construction: $ 1,550,000 Advocating for improvements to the integrity of this wildlife habitat is a joint effort with the project leaders, Alameda County Resource Conservation District (Natural Resources Conservation Service) and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Potential co-sponsors/interested parties include Alameda County Public Works/Flood Control and Water Conservation District, Zone 7, and the Alameda County Water District. The Arroyo and its wildlife habitat are severely impacted by upstream development, local urbanization, and channel instability. Severe down cutting and bank erosion increasingly threaten private properties and an important Alameda County road as well as lower basin groundwater. The sediment and debris move down the drainage to San Francisco Bay, creating new problems. The Arroyo de la Laguna drains about 400 square miles of the watershed to the west of Pleasanton and through Sunol. The stream channel provides critical wildlife habitat for the California Red-Legged Frog, Western Pond Turtle, migrating song birds, and Steelhead Trout. 14. Estudillo Canal Flood Control (Feasibility Study) Project -San Leandro ($850K) Estudillo Canal Flood Control (Feasibility Study) Project (San Leandro) -The USACE Reconnaissance Study phase was completed in October 2004. The project is currently in the beginning of the fourth fiscal year (2008-09) of the Feasibility Study phase. The primary objective of the Feasibility Study is to detennine the extent of Federal interest in providing flood damage reduction in the study area. USACE received $750,000 federal appropriation for fiscal year 2005-06, $600,000 for fiscal year 2006-07, and $392,000 for fiscal year 2007-08. There is currently $200,000 programmed in the President's Budget (anticipated appropriation) for fiscal year 2008-09. USACE requires $850,000 more in federal funds to complete the Study. Benefit of Study and Construction of Improvements: Enable District to submit to FEMA a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) application to remove the FEMA 100-year flood plain designation in the study area Provide increased flood protection to approximately 1,800 residential properties in City of San Leandro Minimize property damages in the community and disruption to daily lives of the residents 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 22 B. HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY 1. Disaster Preparedness and Public Health Infrastructure Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department, Health Care Services Agency Proposal: Improve the County's preparedness for any form of disaster or event, by addressing and prioritizing the following systems to enhance skills and capacity in these functional service areas: Surveillance and epidemiology Public health laboratories Communications systems (interoperable systems) Pharmacy needs Emergency medical services Training and coordination of disaster service workers Training and coordination of health care personnel and volunteers Credentialing system Emergency medication/vaccination dispensing sites Current Law/Status: The experience of several hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and wildfires in California clearly demonstrated the need to ensure that we have systems in place in Alameda County to respond in a timely manner to a natural or manmade disaster. The Public Health Department is currently working in collaboration with other county, State and Federal agencies, local hospitals and clinics, and other institutions to strengthen our communications and responsiveness. However, without a reinforced Public Health infrastructure, an adequate long-term health response to future possible natural disasters, along with bioterrorism threats, will become increasingly more difficult. Discussion: The following proposals will ensure that our State and local disaster response systems are adequately prepared to respond in the case of an emergency crisis situation: Promote public health workforce development - A qualified public health workforce is needed to staff our frontline response to natural disasters and to potential biological threats. However, an estimated 43% of the State's public health workforce could be lost in the next couple of years due to retirements and other factors. Legislation to promote the recruitment and retention of new public health professionals to replace our aging workforce should be supported. Improve communication between disparate organizations and levels of government Clear leadership at the State level provided by the creation of a State Department of Public Health should promote this kind of communication. In addition, regional planning must take place to create communications systems that will be functional in a mutual aid response situation. Additional funding may be needed to support such systems. Develop systems to ensure that services can be delivered in a timely and efficient manner \u00ad Special consideration needs to be given to serving vulnerable and special needs populations. As seen in Hurricane Katrina, pre-planning for disaster response must be focused on those who will be least able to help themselves in the event of a large-scale public health emergency. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 23 Support a statewide credentialing system -Develop and implement a statewide identification system for clinicians (doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, etc) and government employees that are qualified and trained to respond to a disaster in a specific set of skills. Each individual would have an identification badge to allow access to secure areas. This system could be administered by a statewide agency such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or Sheriff's Department, who should be able to provide such services. This would allow a uniform, seamless integration of support staff for mutual aid responses, plus it would necessitate the creation of a statewide data system where individuals with specialized skills could be queried and requested depending on the type of event. Support a statewide volunteer database -Develop and implement a volunteer database similar to the credentialing system above that would have a system in place for volunteers that would be pre\u00ad screened to be able to assist in the event of a disaster. Support legislation which promotes funding opportunities for pre-disaster mitigation -Pre\u00ad disaster mitigation is especially important around protecting first responders, safety net and public health infrastructure so that California can respond to all disasters without being vulnerable. For example, retrofitting fire stations and hospitals is needed so that the buildings will not be damaged in earthquakes. Prioritize no cost or low cost training opportunities that promote skill development -The State should promote a system to ensure all appropriate government, first responder, first receiver staff and other professionals are adequately trained in preparedness and response systems, communication and specialized targeted skills, where appropriate. Fiscal Impact: To address all of these needs, a significant infusion of funds and increased collaboration will be needed. However, this must be balanced against the cost of not investing in the public health infrastructure should there actually be a disaster of some kind in the Bay Area. The Public Health Department proposes identifying federal dollars designated for combating bioterrorism and/or addressing natural disasters to address these county health needs. 2. Health Care Access and Affordability Source of Proposal: Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), Health Care Services Agency Discussion/Analysis: Healthcare in the United States is a patchwork of programs and services -some subsidized, some free. Our healthcare network is cobbled together via federally-funded programs that provide limited free medical care to low-income Americans; payments by local governments to hospitals for indigent care; fee-based community and county clinics; free care donated by physicians; and private and employer-provided insurance. This network allows the insured, underinsured, and uninsured to get limited medical care. However, accessing comprehensive, specialized, affordable health care is a challenge for increasing numbers of Americans. The Uninsured The U.S. Census Bureau reported a decline in the number of people without health insurance coverage from 47 million (15.8 percent) in 2006 to 45.7 million (15.3 percent) in 2007. The number of uninsured children declined from 8.7 million (11.7 percent) in 2006 to 8.1 million (11.0 percent) in 2007. But in 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 24 October 2008 the Kaiser Family Foundation projected that the current economic downturn and rising unemployment rate likely will cause the number of uninsured to grow by at least 2 million in 2008. In California, 6.6 million residents (or about 19%) were without health insurance from 2006-2007. Roughly 1.2 million California children do not have health insurance, despite the state's efforts in the past two years to expand government-sponsored plans for low-income kids. The percentage of people covered by private health insurance was 67.5 percent, down from 67.9 percent in 2006. The percentage of people covered by employment-based health insurance decreased to 59.3 in 2007 from 59.7 percent in 2006. By race/ethnicity in the U.S., 32 percent of Hispanics, 20 percent of African Americans, and 17 percent of Asians were uninsured in 2007. Among non-Hispanic whites, 10.4 percent were uninsured. Race/Ethnicity in California: 31 % 0 f Hispanics are not insured; 19% of African Americans; 12% of whites. Race/ethnicity 33% of Hispanics; 21 % of Blacks; 15% of Asians and almost 7% of whites lack access to healthcare By immigration in Alameda County: 26.4% of non-citizens and 12.6% of naturalized citizens lack healthcare access. The Underinsured According to Health Access California: Uninsured and underinsured families too often avoid getting the care they need, resulting in devastating health impacts. One report showed that uninsured adults in California are far less likely to go to the emergency room (12.1 % had at least one visit) than those on private insurance (20.8%) or public programs (32.9%). Uninsured families who go to the hospital for needed care are often charged exorbitant rates, often much higher than the rate for fully insured patients. Large medical bills are often sent to collection agencies, ruining a family's financial future. A Harvard study indicates that illness and medical bills cause nearly half of all personal bankruptcies. Families are rarely notified of the financial options that exist, from public insurance programs to the hospitals' own charity care policies. One fifth (21 %) of working-age adults both insured and uninsured currently have medical debt. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 25 Proposals Single payer/ universal health coverage. Combine individual mandates and subsidies with required employer contributions for a single payer or universal system. Support federal and state proposals aimed at continuous and universal access to affordable health care for all. Increase Medi-Cal provider rates. Medi-Cal provider rates continue to erode and fail to reflect true medical costs. Declining reimbursement rates, such as the temporary 10% reduction approved in 2008, are compromising the health care safety net that many poorer residents depend on. Certain specialties have limited or no new access (e.g. dental, orthopedics). Provider rates must be increased to stem the number of providers opting out of Medi-Cal participation. Streamline public health insurance enrollment. Enhanced application assistance and system navigation with attention to language and cultural competencies will aid consumers in better understanding and using appropriate health services. Eliminate mid-year eligibility review and provide one year of extended continuous coverage for health insurance enrollment (which is what it was before this budget year). Support SCHIP reauthorization. The federally-funded State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCRIP) supports California's Healthy Families Program, which provides low-cost health coverage to more than 850,000 children in families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to afford private coverage. Federal SCHIP funding expires March 31, 2009. Support State funding of undocumented health care. Ensure the provision of preventive health and health care services to undocumented individuals to protect their health, the health of the public at large, and to prevent more costly health care costs that may ensue if these individuals do not get appropriate and prompt care. Maintain health coverage during budget gaps. In 2008, it took 85 days to adopt the California state budget. During that delay, seniors, disabled children and adults were left without health services as service providers dealt with insufficient or zero funding. Improve/enforce statutes governing California's budget process to eliminate devastating impacts on vulnerable populations. This would ensure consistent financial support to persons dependent on health and social services. Expand Employer Coverage of DependentslInsure single adults. The Urban Institute notes that nationally, only 27.8% of young adults ages 19-26 have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Adult males who are unemployed are most likely to be uninsured. Require employers to allow parents to cover their children up to age 26 as dependents. Support affordable health care options (private or employer based) for these groups. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment II 26 ALAMEDA COUNTY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2009 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM ATTACHMENT III Federal Earnlarks TABLE OF CONTENTS Federal Earmark Requests A.

Social Services Agency a. 2009 FEDERAL EARMARK REQUESTS A. PUBLIC WORKS AGENCY a. Castro Valley Boulevard Pedestrian Enhancement Project ($10M) A Strategic Plan was recently adopted for the Castro Valley Downtown area which identified streetscape improvements as well. The streetscape improvements are necessary to redefine the downtown area into a pedestrian oriented retail area. Castro Valley Boulevard serves a dual role as both a bypass to 1-580 and a commercial district. The amount of traffic along Castro Valley Boulevard has resulted in an unfriendly walking/shopping environment. Implementation of the streetscape improvements will convert Castro Valley Boulevard into a walkable, pedestrian oriented environment. This project would include reduced lane widths, traffic calming measures; e.g., (bulb-outs), landscaping, street\u00ad scaping, artwork, and wider sidewalk areas. (The Agency is currently working on design of project -could be advertised in 24 months). This project is a high priority for the Castro Valley community for revitalizing the downtown business. It is interdependent upon the completion of several regional projects to reduce congestion related bypass traffic in the downtown area. b. Federal funding for Coliseum BART to Bay Trail Connector ($4.5M) The Bay Trail is a planned 400-mile continuous biking and hiking path encircling San Francisco Bay. This project would link the Oakland Coliseum BART station to the Martin Luther King, If. recreational shoreline. Two hundred and thirty miles of Bay Trail have been developed. However, there are significant portions that have not been completed. This project will connect a gap in the City of Oakland between the Oakland Coliseum, the 66th Avenue BART station, and the Martin Luther King, If. Regional Shoreline. The Coliseum BART to Bay Trail Project has the potential to connect bicyclists and pedestrians with BART, Amtrack, and AC Transit, as well as increase public access to the Bay Trail. Funding could be used in 2009 or 2010. c. Crow Canyon Road Safety Project ($4.5M) There is one location on Crow Canyon Road which the County has targeted for realignment due to the number of collisions related to the sharp curvature of the roadway. The estimated cost to realign this curve to improve traffic safety is $15 million. The County will continue to seek (state) STIP funding for this project but these funds are not likely to be available for several years. In the interim, the County will seek federal monies for final design, federal/state 2009 Legislative Program Attachment III 2 environmental clearance (NEPA), and right of way acqUIsItIOn ($1.5M for Design/Environmental; $3M for right of way). This funding strategy would allow the County to advance the project and have it ready for construction when funds become available. The County has completed a corridor study and preliminary environmental studies and is proceeding with preliminary engineering. Crow Canyon Road serves as a two-lane major regional route between Contra Costa County and Alameda County carrying approximately 25,000 vehicles per day. Because there is a significant travel time savings in using Crow Canyon Road verses 1-680 and 1-580 during commute hours when the freeways are congested, many commuters choose to travel on Crow Canyon Road as a commute alternative. Crow Canyon Road was not designed to carry this high volume of traffic at freeway speeds. As a result, there have been numerous collisions on the roadway. Major engineering improvements are required to address long term, rapidly-escalating safety issues on this roadway for both commuters and residents along Crow Canyon Road between Castro Valley and San Ramon. d. East 14th/Mission Boulevard Revitalization Project ($15M) East 14th Street/Mission Boulevard is a high priority redevelopment project for the Ashland and Cherryland areas of unincorporated Alameda County. The Ashland and Cherryland areas are economically challenged communities served by the retail corridor of East 14th StreetlMission Boulevard. Revitalization of this retail corridor will stimulate the area by attracting new businesses and lead the way to regeneration of the entire area. In this section, please provide a thorough analysis of your recommended proposal. Phase one of three has been constructed and has made a significant area improvement. However, design and construction funding for the remaining two phases is lacking. (Substantial funding is still needed). e. East Lewelling Boulevard Circulation and Streetscape Improvement Project Phase II ($9M) East Lewelling Boulevard is an arterial roadway that connects major commercial corridors Hesperian Boulevard and Mission Boulevard. This roadway has significant traffic congestion and a lack of sidewalks and requires safety improvements for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. Phase I of the project between Hesperian Boulevard and Meekland Avenue is scheduled for construction in summer of 2009. A concept plan was developed for Phase II when Phase I was studied. The County wants to proceed with the Design, Environmental clearance, and right of way acquisition tasks (estimated project costs: $lM Design/Environmental and $2M for right of way) to be ready for construction when funds become available. The East Lewelling Boulevard Circulation and Streetscape Improvement Project (Phase II) is located along East Lewelling Boulevard between East 14th Street and Meekland Avenue. This 2009 Legislative Program Attachment III 3 project will construct median islands, sidewalks, bicycle lanes and install landscaping along the project. (upon securing funding, the project could be advertised in 24 to 30 months). f. Fruitvale Bridge Lifeline Seismic Retrofit Project ($3M) Since the City of Alameda is an island, it is dependent upon four bridges and two tubes for access. In the event of a catastrophic seismic event, one facility needs to be upgraded to a lifeline status so that supplies and services can be provided to the City of Alameda in case all other bridges are significantly damaged.

The County conducted a study of the estuary bridges between the Cities of Alameda and Oakland to identify the most feasible bridge for lifeline seismic retrofitting. The best candidate and most cost effective bridge for lifeline retrofitting is the Fruitvale Avenue Bridge. The estimated cost of the project is approximately $40M. While the feasibility study has been completed, monies for design and construction of the lifeline improvements are still required. The County will seek both (state) STIP and HBP funding for this project although the high cost of the project will make it difficult to obtain complete funding. Federal funding for this important regional project would help leverage limited local area monies for the project. g. Hesperian Boulevard Pedestrian Safety and Enhancement Project ($5M) Hesperian Boulevard is a major commercial corridor through the San Lorenzo area. Unfortunately, it also serves as a major arterial along the 1-880 corridor. The result is that the amount of traffic along Hesperian Boulevard divides the San Lorenzo community in two. A Streetscape master plan has been developed and is in need of funding for implementation. Two phases of the project are currently under design and should be constructed in the next two to three years. The remaining portion between Hacienda Avenue and Via Mercado remain unfunded and could be designed and constructed easily with funding. The improvements would facilitate a safer and more walkable environment by improving sidewalk areas, providing applicable traffic calming such as bulb-outs, provide landscaping and streetscape improvements, and gateway improvements. These improvements would reduce the impact of the diverted freeway traffic thus allowing Hesperian Boulevard to serve as a major arterial and a community functional roadway. (Project could be delivered in 18 months). This is a high priority project in the San Lorenzo community. It is part of a regional bypass corridor to 1-880 extending between the City of Hayward, through Alameda County, and into the City of San Leandro. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment III 4 h. Funding for 1\u00b7580 HOV Lanes Project ($600M) The 1-580 corridor in the Tri-Valley is one of the most traffic congested in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area region. It serves as a key inter-regional gateway between the Bay Area and the Central Valley for goods movement and commute workforce travel. This chronic condition has resulted in I-580's designation in the top five most congested corridors identified in the annual report jointly published by Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). This condition will be exacerbated with traffic projected to increase 90 percent by 2030 in this corridor. To respond to the eXIstmg and projected congestion, the Alameda County Congestion Management Agency (CMA) has identified a series of planned improvements for this corridor. These include: implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); construction of HOV lanes in the eastbound and westbound direction with future conversion to SMARTIHOT lanes; interchange improvements that include building a new interchange at Isabel in Livermore and reconstruction of the existing 1-580/1-680 interchange; auxiliary lanes; and truck climbing lanes in Livermore.

Cost estimates for the HOV lanes including the Isabel interchange are $450 million. Estimates for the 1-580/1-680 interchange range from $450 million to $1 billion. Approximately $100 million is needed for truck climbing lanes. MTC has submitted the HOV lanes project to the State for funding from the recently approved transportation bond with a decision expected by the end of February. Funding for construction of remaining phases of road improvements has not yet been identified. i. School Safety Projects ($6M) The unincorporated areas of Alameda County have over $400 million in needed sidewalk improvements to promote community pedestrian safety near schools. As a result, the County has developed a prioritized list of sidewalk projects using factors such as school proximity, high pedestrian generators, and accident history with the ultimate goal of improving safety conditions for pedestrians and children surrounding school areas. The County has identified Sidewalk projects immediately adjacent to schools that have been constructed or are under design. While these projects have helped by providing sidewalks so that school children do not have to walk in the street, there are still many routes without sidewalks where children must walk in the street to avoid parked cars or puddles. The estimated unit cost for sidewalk installation is approximately $600,000/1000 feet of sidewalk on both sides of a street. Sidewalk projects may be broken into smaller segments and designed and constructed as funding is made available. The County's priority remains providing safe and walkable access for children on the way to school, access to transit to encourage use of public transportation alternatives, and walkable neighborhoods for seniors. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment III 5 j. Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Plan ($500K) The Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Plan will develop and examine future transportation alternatives along the Union Pacific Railroad Corridor between the Fruitvale BART station in the City of Oakland and the Union City BART station in the City of Union City. The Corridor is Approximately 15 miles long. The Union Pacific (Oakland Subdivision) Railroad Corridor Improvement Study will develop and examine future transportation alternatives (pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and rail) along the Union Pacific Railroad Corridor between the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland and the Union City BART station in the City of Union City. The Corridor is approximately 15 miles long. This planning effort provides opportunity to convert the railway corridor into a multi-use access that benefits area residents and enhances transportation options for local communities. k. Funding for Vasco Road Project -Phase II ($17M) This request is for funding for continued Vasco Road improvements. The proposed continuation of the project (Phase II) will realign the roadway and install a median barrier southerly of the current project for approximately one mile. The estimated cost of the Phase II project is $17M. Funding hasn't been established but the County will seek future funds including (state) STIP and TVTC. Federal funding would help expedite design and environmental clearance of the project to improve the overall project's construction readiness. The County has completed the utility relocation component of the safety improvement project between mile posts 3.0 and 4.3 and has commenced with construction of the roadway realignment project. Due to a history of severe collisions on the roadway, Phase II includes the installation of a median barrier to further protect motorists from crossover head-on collisions. A federal appropriation received for the project was instrumental in the delivery of the project. This project will extend Phase I improvements which are also being incorporated into Contra Costa County Vasco Road projects. A. SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY 1. Assessment Center The Children's Assessment Center is open 23 hours a day and is a countywide three-site program that allows frontline Child Protective Service (CPS) workers to bring children to a safe, child\u00ad oriented setting when they have been removed from their homes. Multi-disciplinary teams of professionals who conduct preliminary assessments of the children staff the Center. Its core function is to provide an appropriate environment that provides the time and resources needed to make a full assessment and the most appropriate placement decision for each child. Appropriation funding will go towards much of the operating facility costs and towards the cost of the child care contract. 2009 Legislative Program Attachment III 6 2009 Legislative Program Attachment III 7 "}
