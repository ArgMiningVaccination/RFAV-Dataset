The most frequent indications for IVC therapy result from the belief in its effectiveness as a potent anti-cancer agent which additionally enhances chemosensitivity of cancer cells and reduces chemotherapy-related toxicities and fatigue intensity. In this narrative review, we decided to deal with this issue, trying to answer the question whether there is any scientific evidence supporting the rationale for application of high-dose IVC therapy in advanced-stage cancer patients. Although results obtained from preclinical studies demonstrated that millimolar ascorbate plasma concentrations achievable only after IVC administration were cytotoxic to fast-growing malignant cells and inhibited tumor growth as well as prolonged the survival of laboratory animals, such positive effects were not found in human studies with advanced-stage cancer patients. We also have not found the rationale for the use of IVC to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy and to reduce the chemotherapy-induced toxicity in the above mentioned group. Nevertheless, in palliative care, high-dose IVC might be considered as a therapy improving the quality of life and reducing cancer-related symptoms, such as fatigue and bone pain. However, because of the absence of placebo-controlled randomized trials on IVC efficacy in advanced-stage cancer patients, the placebo effect cannot be excluded.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-02-26", "cleaned_text": "[1](#B1-nutrients-13-00735)], researchers, physicians, and cancer patients have become more interested in the method of the intravenous vitamin C (IVC) administration. Results obtained from in vitro studies revealed that millimolar ascorbate plasma concentrations, achievable only after intravenous vitamin C administration, are cytotoxic to fast-growing malignant cells. These results were also consistent with the data obtained from animal studies, where injections of high-dose vitamin C inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of laboratory animals. The wide IVC popularity in the 2000s is evidenced by the data from the survey conducted by Padayatty et al. [ [2](#B2-nutrients-13-00735)], in which an unexpectedly common use of vitamin C was reported among complementary and alternative medicine practitioners. Of 199 survey responders, 172 administered IVC to 11,233 patients in 2006 and to 8876 patients in 2008 with an average dose of 28 g every four days and 22 total treatments per patient, most frequently due to infection, cancer, and fatigue [ [2](#B2-nutrients-13-00735)]. Although the scale of the use of high-dose IVC treatment in recent times is unknown, it seems to enjoy unflagging interest from patients with advanced-stage cancer disease, refractory to standard therapy. The most frequent questions asked by patients and their families to palliative medicine specialists concern the effectiveness of high-dose IVC as anti-cancer therapy and its use as an agent enhancing chemosensitivity of cancer cells or reducing chemotherapy-related toxicities and fatigue. In this narrative review, we decided to deal with this issue, trying to answer the question whether there is any scientific evidence supporting the rationale for application of high-dose IVC therapy in advanced-stage cancer patients. 2. Over 50 Years of History of the Anti-Cancer Properties of Vitamin C [3](#B3-nutrients-13-00735), [4](#B4-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the early 1970s, Cameron and Pauling [ [5](#B5-nutrients-13-00735)] published the thesis claiming that ascorbic acid is able to potentiate the intrinsic production of serum physiological hyaluronidase inhibitor (PIH), thereby protecting against the spreading of cancer cells. Although reasons for hypotheses mentioned above were not clear, they have started out a widespread discussion about the value of vitamin C in cancer prophylaxis, supportive therapy, and palliative treatment [ [6](#B6-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a later publication, Cameron and Pauling proved that ascorbic acid is directly involved in specific biochemical reactions that collectively support the natural host resistance to malignant invasive growth, through potentiation of stromal fibrosis, increased effectiveness of malignant cell encapsulation in fibrous tissue, extended lymphocytic infiltration, and protection of adreno-pituitary axis against depletion generated by cancer-related stress [ [6](#B6-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the observational study conducted by Cameron and Campbell in 1974 [ [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735)], a daily dose of 10 g ascorbic acid was administered intravenously for 10 days followed by the same dose given orally to 50 terminal cancer patients. They observed various effects after ascorbate treatment. Tumor growth retardation and inhibition were noticed in 11 (22%) and three patients (6%), respectively, while no clinical response was observed in 17 patients (35%) and only minimal response was found in 10 patients (20%). On the other hand, in five patients (10%), tumor progression was noticed, but in other four patients (8%), a hemorrhage to a tumor occurred followed by its necrosis and accelerated patient's death [ [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735)]. According to the authors, certain study participants also benefited from vitamin C therapy, demonstrating relief from bone pain due to metastases and from other mass effects (headache, Horner's syndrome, laryngeal nerve paresis). Moreover, they revealed a significant reduction in the rate of re-accumulation of malignant ascites and malignant pleural effusion, reduction in the degree of hematuria, reversal of terminal malignant jaundice, or a decrease in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a subsequent publication, Cameron and Pauling [ [8](#B8-nutrients-13-00735)] presented results of an observational case-control study in which 100 terminal cancer patients were given supplemental ascorbate as a part of their routine management and were compared to 1000 controls matched for sex, age, type of the primary tumor, and treatment. The study showed that the mean survival time was more than 4 times longer for the ascorbate treated subjects (receiving 10 g intravenously for 10 days and orally thereafter) than for controls not receiving vitamin C; moreover, survival time of 10% of the former group was 20 times greater than in controls [ [8](#B8-nutrients-13-00735)]. Almost a twofold prolongation of average survival time in terminal cancer patients after vitamin C administration was observed also by Murata et al. [ [9](#B9-nutrients-13-00735)]. [10](#B10-nutrients-13-00735)] conducted in 1979 a randomized, controlled double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin C (10 g daily by oral route) on the severity of symptoms and survival rate in 123 patients with advanced and preterminal cancer. The study proved a lack of vitamin C effect. There were no statistically significant differences in survival time between ascorbate and control groups [ [10](#B10-nutrients-13-00735)]. Although study participants reported improved appetite, strength, activity level, and pain control, there were also no statistically significant differences in the severity of symptoms between two treated groups [ [10](#B10-nutrients-13-00735)]. Similarly, Moertel et al. [ [11](#B11-nutrients-13-00735)] in a double-blind placebo-controlled study with 100 advanced colorectal cancer patients randomly assigned to treatment either with 10 g of vitamin C daily or placebo showed no advantage with regard to either the interval between the beginning of treatment and disease progression or patient survival time. Based on subsequent experiments, it is now known that results obtained by Creagan et al. and Moertel et al. should not be compared with those of Cameron and Pauling because of a different route of vitamin C administration [ [12](#B12-nutrients-13-00735)]. We discussed this issue in the next chapter. [13](#B13-nutrients-13-00735)], basing on the evidence that millimolar vitamin C plasma concentrations achieved only through intravenous (but not oral) administration can be toxic to some cancer cells [ [14](#B14-nutrients-13-00735), [15](#B15-nutrients-13-00735), [16](#B16-nutrients-13-00735), [17](#B17-nutrients-13-00735), [18](#B18-nutrients-13-00735)], proposed that ascorbate treatment of cancer should be re-examined. They published three well-documented cases of advanced cancers where patients had unexpectedly long survival times after receiving high-dose intravenous vitamin C (15-65 g twice a week for 2-10 months, followed by continuation in smaller doses for 1-4 years) as their only significant therapy [ [19](#B19-nutrients-13-00735)]. Since then, numerous studies have investigated the effects of high-dose vitamin C on tumor growth, survival, impact on quality of life (QoL), side effects associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, cancer-related symptoms, and interactions with conventional anti-cancer therapy [ [20](#B20-nutrients-13-00735)]. 3. Vitamin C Intravenous Versus Oral Route [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735), [8](#B8-nutrients-13-00735), [21](#B21-nutrients-13-00735), [22](#B22-nutrients-13-00735)], ascorbic acid given intravenously in daily doses of 10 g was recognized as effective in the treatment of cancer. This effect was not observed in double-blind placebo-controlled trials conducted in the Mayo Clinic, when the same doses of ascorbate were given only by the oral route [ [10](#B10-nutrients-13-00735), [11](#B11-nutrients-13-00735)], leading to the conclusion that the route of administration may result in differences of ascorbate bioavailability which influences its potential anti-cancer properties. [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]. The rate of ascorbic acid utilization is the additional mechanism that may be meaningful in disease states [ [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]. For this reason, ascorbate concentration in plasma does not exceed 100 mol/L when it is supplied orally with food; even with oral supplementation approaching maximum tolerated doses, it is always <250 mol/L [ [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]. It was demonstrated in a depletion-repletion pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers that, with the oral daily dose of 100 mg, the concentration of ascorbate in daily fasting plasma reaches a plateau between 50-60 \u00b5mol/L [ [24](#B24-nutrients-13-00735)]. Whereas increasing the daily dose ten times to 1000 mg gives only a slight increase in plasma concentration to 70-85 mol/L, with a subsequent minimal additional increase resulting from the dose of 2500 mg (plasma concentrations about 80-90 mol/L) [ [24](#B24-nutrients-13-00735)]. Intracellular ascorbate concentrations in circulating immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) reached maximum at the 100 mg daily dose of vitamin C and did not increase at higher doses [ [24](#B24-nutrients-13-00735)]. Bioavailability is 100% after a single dose of 200 mg, and it declines at higher vitamin C doses, reaching about 33% after a single dose of 1250 mg [ [24](#B24-nutrients-13-00735)]. [1](#B1-nutrients-13-00735)]. The intravenous route bypasses the regulation of intestinal uptake of oral vitamin C dependent on the sodium-dependent transporter-1 (SVCT1), resulting in an uncontrolled rise in plasma concentration [ [25](#B25-nutrients-13-00735)]. After intravenous administration of 1.25 g of ascorbic acid in healthy volunteers, the peak plasma ascorbate was about 6.5-fold greater than after the administration of the same dose given by the oral route [ [1](#B1-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the same study, pharmacokinetic modeling predicted the plasma ascorbate concentration of 220 mol/L for the maximum tolerated oral dose of 3 g every 4 h, compared to 13,350 mol/L (13.35 mmol/L) and 15,380 mol/L (15.38 mmol/L) for 50 g and 100 g intravenous single doses, respectively [ [1](#B1-nutrients-13-00735)]. It is worth mentioning that intravenous administration can lead to even 30 to 70-fold higher plasma levels of ascorbate than the highest tolerated oral dose [ [1](#B1-nutrients-13-00735)]. However, these high concentrations are relatively transient due to the rapid clearance by the kidneys resulting in a half-life of about 2 h in circulation [ [25](#B25-nutrients-13-00735)]. In cancer patients either undergoing or not receiving chemotherapy, intravenous administration of vitamin C in a single dose of 0.1-3.0 g/kg of body weight resulted in maximum plasma concentrations Cmax ranging from 2 to of Vitamin C [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. Most vitamin C biological functions are associated with the presence of a lactone ring with electron rich 2-en-2,3-diol-1-one moiety in its molecule [ [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735)]. Under physiological pH conditions, vitamin C exists predominantly as the ascorbate anion, arising from the completely dissociated 3-hydroxyl group [ [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735)]. Although ascorbic acid serves both as a reducing agent and antioxidant, it is best known for its capacity to act as an antioxidant able to undergo two consecutive one-electron oxidation reactions and deprotonation of both hydroxyl groups at positions 2 and 3, resulting in the formation of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), which is unstable in neutral pH [ [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735), [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the above mentioned process, intermediate radical species are formed, such as relatively stable ascorbyl radical (Asc) [ [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735), [36](#B36-nutrients-13-00735)]. Although dehydroascorbic acid and ascorbate free radicals can be easily reduced by both NADH-and NADPH-dependent mechanisms, the main pathway of ascorbate recycling is enzymatic, mediated largely by glutaredoxin and thioredoxin reductase [ [37](#B37-nutrients-13-00735)]. [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735), [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. Red blood cells do not express SVCT 2 and accumulate ascorbate by the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid through sodium-independent facilitative GLUT type glucose transporters, followed by intracellular reduction to ascorbate [ [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the plasma of healthy humans, the reduced form of ascorbate is dominant, while dehydroascorbic acid is present at a very low level, in the range of 0-2 \u00b5M or about 1-2% of ascorbate concentrations [ [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735), [37](#B37-nutrients-13-00735)]. In some organs, such as brain, adrenals, liver, and white blood cells, high intracellular ascorbate concentrations are found, ranging up to 20 mmol/L, in response to the demand for ascorbate as an expression [ [45](#B45-nutrients-13-00735)], and reduced oxidative stress in brain [ [46](#B46-nutrients-13-00735)]. It also decreased the steady-state level of oxidative DNA damage to mononuclear blood cells [ [47](#B47-nutrients-13-00735)] and protected neutrophils against ROS generated during phagocytosis [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, ascorbate participates in the regeneration of other antioxidants such as glutathione and -tocopherol back to their active state [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. In animal studies, the administration of vitamin C, due to its antioxidant effect, was able to ameliorate the toxic effect of methotrexate in liver and kidney tissues, which occurred because of enhanced oxidative stress [ [48](#B48-nutrients-13-00735)]. [34](#B34-nutrients-13-00735)]. Reactions of ascorbate with oxygen or with free transition metal ions lead to the generation of superoxide, H2O2 and highly reactive oxidants, such as the hydroxyl radical by promoting the Fenton chemistry [ [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. The ability to reduce transition metals is regarded as fundamental to the activity of ascorbate as an essential co-factor for reactions requiring reduced iron or copper metalloenzymes [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735), [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. It influences collagen gene expression, cellular procollagen secretion, and the biosynthesis of other connective tissue fibronectin, proteoglycans, bone matrix, and elastin-associated fibrillin [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. it is necessary for the biosynthesis of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and is involved in tyrosine metabolism as well [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. Ascorbate regulates the transcription of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [ [25](#B25-nutrients-13-00735)] and acts as for enzymes named ten-eleven translocation (TET) family dioxygenases, essential in the demethylation of DNA [ The Jumonji for histone demethylation [ [50](#B50-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, ascorbic acid increases the intestinal absorption of non-heme iron from the diet and participates in the maximization of some hormones activity, such as cholecystokinin, oxytocin, vasopressin, and alpha-melanotropin [ [51](#B51-nutrients-13-00735)]. Anti-inflammatory properties of ascorbic acid result in the reduction of cytokines, chemokines, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in plasma [ [52](#B52-nutrients-13-00735), [53](#B53-nutrients-13-00735)]. 5. Vitamin C Plasma Concentrations in End-Stage Cancer Patients [54](#B54-nutrients-13-00735)]. Severe vitamin C deficiency (plasma concentration <11 mol/L) can be a problem concerning 1.4% to 20% of healthy adults, making them more likely to develop clinical manifestations of scurvy [ [55](#B55-nutrients-13-00735)]. That percentage can be significantly higher in the enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory processes that increase utilization of ascorbate. Furthermore, impaired oral intake or a history of surgery or radiation reducing absorptive surfaces [ [51](#B51-nutrients-13-00735)] makes the compensation for the increased demand for ascorbic acid impossible. What is more, the need for vitamin C increases during anti-cancer therapy [ [59](#B59-nutrients-13-00735), [63](#B63-nutrients-13-00735), [66](#B66-nutrients-13-00735), [67](#B67-nutrients-13-00735), [68](#B68-nutrients-13-00735), [ [70](#B70-nutrients-13-00735), [71](#B71-nutrients-13-00735), [72](#B72-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a Danish study among 20 patients with myeloid cancers who were undergoing treatment with 5-azacytidine at baseline, 14 patients were vitamin C deficient and in eight cases, the deficiency was profound [ [59](#B59-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, as the disease stage progresses, ascorbate plasma levels decline in comparison with an early cancer stage and with healthy subjects as well [ [51](#B51-nutrients-13-00735), [57](#B57-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a study by Mayland et al. [ [56](#B56-nutrients-13-00735)], severe vitamin C deficiency was found in 30% of hospice residents with advanced cancer. Riordan et al. [ [58](#B58-nutrients-13-00735)] observed severe ascorbate deficiency in 50% of terminal cancer patients. It was observed that the low dietary intake, low albumin plasma concentration, high platelet count, high CRP level, disseminated cancer, and shorter survival were significantly associated with low plasma vitamin C in the above mentioned group [ [56](#B56-nutrients-13-00735)]. [51](#B51-nutrients-13-00735)]\u2014most of them are often observed in end-stage cancer patients. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin C is 90 mg/day for adult men and 75 mg/day for adult women, however it is proposed that recommended vitamin C intakes should be based on body weight or optimum plasma concentration about 70 mol/L [ [54](#B54-nutrients-13-00735), [73](#B73-nutrients-13-00735)]. 6. Potential Anticancer Properties of Vitamin C [74](#B74-nutrients-13-00735)]. The first hypotheses emphasized highly reactive oxidation-reduction properties of the ascorbic acid-dehydroascorbic acid system that might be capable of interfering with some metabolic pathways characteristic for cancer cells, such as anerobiosis known as the Warburg effect and differences in electrical charge on their membranes compared to normal cells [ [6](#B6-nutrients-13-00735), [75](#B75-nutrients-13-00735), [76](#B76-nutrients-13-00735)]. Benade et al. [ [74](#B74-nutrients-13-00735)] in 1969 proposed that the main cytotoxic mechanism of ascorbate can be connected with intracellular generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced upon oxidation of vitamin C. This occurs because cancer cells selectively take up more ascorbate compared to normal cells through the facilitated transport with participation of glucose transporters (GLUTs) due to an increased metabolic need for glucose [ [20](#B20-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the in vitro study, it was demonstrated that ascorbate cytotoxicity towards cancer cells is increased synergistically by the concomitant administration of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATA) which specifically inhibits catalase activity in cancer cells (catalase catalyzes decomposition of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 to oxygen and water), thereby decreasing the ability of cancer cells to detoxify the H2O2 effectively. Additionally, it was found that catalase activity in cancer cells is 10-100-fold lower than in normal cells, making them over-sensitive to ascorbate [ [74](#B74-nutrients-13-00735)]. The next studies conducted in vitro on cancer cells revealed that both ascorbate and its oxidation product, dehydroascorbate, at high doses were cytotoxic or lethal to fast-growing malignant cells [ [14](#B14-nutrients-13-00735), [77](#B77-nutrients-13-00735)], but less toxic to non-malignant cells [ [14](#B14-nutrients-13-00735)]. In addition, xenograft experiments showed that parenteral ascorbate in the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, administered as the only treatment once or twice daily and leading to an increased blood and tissue ascorbate concentration >30 mmol/L, significantly (p < 0.05) decreased both tumor growth and weight rates of glioblastoma, ovarian and pancreatic carcinoma cells in mice [ [78](#B78-nutrients-13-00735)]. Other animal studies indicated that parenterally administered high doses of vitamin C (0.1-8 g/kg body weight daily for 2-4 weeks) not only inhibited tumor growth but also reduced invasiveness of cancer cells and increased cell types in cell culture media containing appropriate ascorbate concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mmol/L. It was shown that normal cells were unaffected by 1-2 h incubation in 20 mmol/L ascorbate, whereas 5 cancer cell lines had EC50 values of <4 mmol/L [ [86](#B86-nutrients-13-00735)], and EC50 values were <10 mmol/L for other 75% tumor cells tested [ [78](#B78-nutrients-13-00735)]. Cancer cell death observed by Chen et al. [ [86](#B86-nutrients-13-00735)] was associated with extracellular, not intracellular ascorbate. Moreover, it was dependent on extracellular H2O2 formation upon oxidation of ascorbate and displayed a linear relationship with ascorbyl radical (Asc) formation as an intermediate. Ascorbate generated detectable levels of H2O2 in extracellular medium in the presence of serum, but not in whole blood, indicating that ascorbate at high concentrations achieved only during intravenous administration may be a pro-drug for H2O2 delivery to tissues [ [86](#B86-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a study by Maramag et al. [ [17](#B17-nutrients-13-00735)], the treatment of human prostate cancer cells with vitamin C resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability and thymidine incorporation into DNA. Addition of catalase, an enzyme that degrades hydrogen peroxide to culture medium inhibited the above mentioned effects, whereas superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that dismutates superoxide and generates hydrogen peroxide, did not prevent decrease in cell numbers and DNA synthesis, supporting the thesis that the cytotoxic effect of vitamin C is related to the production of hydrogen peroxide [ [17](#B17-nutrients-13-00735)]. Makino et al. [ [16](#B16-nutrients-13-00735)] and Sakagami et al. [ [18](#B18-nutrients-13-00735)] observed that induction of cell death in human renal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cell lines was caused by ascorbic acid derivatives which produce ascorbyl radicals during the oxidative degradation (sodium-L-ascorbate, L-ascorbic acid, 2-phosphate magnesium and L-ascorbic acid 2-sulfate dipotassium salt, which do not produce the ascorbyl radical, were inactive, suggesting the possible role of the ascorbyl radical in cell death induction [ [16](#B16-nutrients-13-00735)]. A catalytic concentration of copper increased ascorbate toxicity to melanoma cells two to five-fold, whereas cytotoxicity to other cells increased only 1 to 1.5 times [ [15](#B15-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, exposure of HL-60 cells and human bladder tumor cells to ascorbic acid or its active derivatives resulted in the rapid elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which might serve as the initial signal leading to the cell death pathway [ [18](#B18-nutrients-13-00735), [87](#B87-nutrients-13-00735)]. [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the extracellular fluid, a molecule of ascorbic acid loses one electron and forms an ascorbate radical, whereas this electron subsequently reduces ferric iron to ferrous iron, as it was shown in the chemical reaction presented below [ [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]: [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]: [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]: [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. A possible mechanism of cell killing by high intracellular concentrations of ascorbate can involve the mobilization of intracellular iron storage by ascorbate, followed by the Fenton reaction to give highly reactive hydroxyl radicals [ [88](#B88-nutrients-13-00735)]. [78](#B78-nutrients-13-00735), [89](#B89-nutrients-13-00735)]. In mice bearing glioblastoma xenografts, it was shown that a single pharmacologic dose of vitamin C produced a sustained ascorbate radical and hydrogen peroxide formation selectively within interstitial fluids of the tumor tissue (but not in blood) [ [78](#B78-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, after parenteral vitamin C administration, Asc achieved blood concentrations <5 nmol/L (even when corresponding ascorbate concentrations were >8 mmol/L), while Asc concentrations in the extracellular fluid of the tumor tissue were from 4 to 12-fold higher than those achieved in the blood and were a function of ascorbate concentrations [ [89](#B89-nutrients-13-00735)]. However, the studies conducted so far have not answered the question why ascorbate throughout the production of H2O2 is able to kill some cancer cells while it is nontoxic to normal cells. It was demonstrated that H2O2 is generated in the extracellular space, but because H2O2 is a membrane-permeable agent, the targets for its action can be located extra- and intracellularly as well, generating oxidative cell damage [ [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735), [86](#B86-nutrients-13-00735)]. It is suggested that extracellular H2O2 might target membrane lipids, forming hydroperoxides or reactive intermediates that are repaired in normal but not cancer cells. Moreover, intracellular H2O2 could target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or DNA repair proteins [ [86](#B86-nutrients-13-00735)]. Superoxide radical anions and H2O2 are important signaling molecules involved in pro-inflammatory responses among other pathways [ [90](#B90-nutrients-13-00735)]. [91](#B91-nutrients-13-00735)]. To answer the question about the mechanism by which DHA is able to kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells, Yun et al. [ [91](#B91-nutrients-13-00735)] conducted the study reporting that cultured human colorectal cancer cells with KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) mutations were selectively killed when exposed to high concentrations of vitamin C, and that effect resulted from an increased DHA uptake via the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Inside the cell, DHA is reduced by GSH, NADH, and NADPH-dependent enzymes leading to the depletion of glutathione, thioredoxin, and NADPH, thus increasing the intracellular oxidative inside cells inactivates glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), leads to of glycolytic adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and pyruvate, causing an energetic crisis that triggers cell death [ [91](#B91-nutrients-13-00735)]. Such cytotoxic effect was subsequently confirmed in Apc/KrasG12D mutant mouse intestinal cancers [ [91](#B91-nutrients-13-00735)]. As KRAS and BRAF mutations are found in approximately 40% and 10% of human colorectal cancers (CRCs), respectively, the therapeutic use of vitamin C in treating patients with colorectal cancer presenting such type of mutations seems to be rational [ [91](#B91-nutrients-13-00735)]. [92](#B92-nutrients-13-00735), [93](#B93-nutrients-13-00735), [94](#B94-nutrients-13-00735)]. Ascorbate as keeps the iron enzyme in the active state (Fe2+) and is involved in controlling both protein stability and the formation of an active transcription complex modulating the cell survival response [ [95](#B95-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a state of ascorbate deficiency, HIF-hydroxylase activity is compromised and HIF transcription activity is increased, especially in the environment of mild or moderate hypoxia which is characteristic for neoplastic tissue [ [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. On the other hand, it is proposed that increasing ascorbate supplied to cancer cells could stimulate the activity of the HIF-hydroxylases and slow tumor growth rates by the suppressed activation of the HIFs [ [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. [49](#B49-nutrients-13-00735), [50](#B50-nutrients-13-00735)]. The loss of 5hmC has recently been identified as a novel hallmark for some types of cancer, such as malignant melanoma [ [96](#B96-nutrients-13-00735)]. Studies have shown that overexpressing TET2 in melanoma cells and TET1 in breast cancer cells increase their 5hmC content and decrease their malignancy in vitro and in vivo [ [96](#B96-nutrients-13-00735)]. Addition of ascorbate into the medium in a dose- and time-dependent manner promotes TET activity, leading to a rapid and enhanced generation of 5hmC in cultured cell lines [ [97](#B97-nutrients-13-00735), [98](#B98-nutrients-13-00735)]. It has been also proved by Gustafson et al. [ [96](#B96-nutrients-13-00735)] that vitamin C at both physiological and pharmacological concentrations is able to re-establish the 5hmC global content in melanoma cells towards that in normal melanocytes, while decreasing its invasiveness and clonogenic growth. [83](#B83-nutrients-13-00735)], but also the altered expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and angiogenesis [ [82](#B82-nutrients-13-00735), [91](#B91-nutrients-13-00735), [99](#B99-nutrients-13-00735)], reduced levels of factor protein VEGF [ [100](#B100-nutrients-13-00735), [101](#B101-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, vitamin C has been shown to generate the cell cycle arrest (G0/G1), caspase-independent autophagy mediated by beclin-1 and apoptosis-inducing factor induction of oxidative DNA damage, apoptosis mediated by Bax protein signalling, release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and cleavage of poly[ADP-ribose] on the benefits of high-dose IVC therapy in patients with advanced-stage cancer, we relied on the data from studies conducted among patients whose profile best suited patients under palliative care, namely patients with disseminated neoplastic disease, resistant to standard anti-cancer treatment. 7. Does High-Dose IVC in Monotherapy Is an Effective Advanced-Stage Malignancies? [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735), [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735), [29](#B29-nutrients-13-00735), [58](#B58-nutrients-13-00735)] and one report presenting seven clinical cases [ [108](#B108-nutrients-13-00735)]. All participants of analyzed studies had advanced malignancies with distant metastases or cancer disease refractory to standard anti-cancer therapy. [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735)] to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of high-dose IVC among 17 study participants with solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, a 4-week IVC treatment was administered in doses ranging from 30 to 110 g/m2 for 4 consecutive days in a week. None of the subjects experienced an objective tumor-related response (13 patients had progressive disease, three patients presented stable disease, one patient was withdrawn from the study) [ [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735)]. Similarly, Hoffer et al. [ [29](#B29-nutrients-13-00735)] in a phase I clinical trial conducted in patients with advanced malignancies, administered IVC in doses ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 g/kg body weight three times weekly for an average 10 weeks and did not observe an objective tumor-related response in any of 24 study participants. Neither disease remission nor significant reduction in tumor growth was also reported by Nielsen et al. [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735)] in a study group of chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving weekly infusions of IVC (5, 30, and 60 g a week in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-12th week, respectively). Riordan et al. [ [58](#B58-nutrients-13-00735)], among 24 late stage terminal cancer patients receiving continuous IVC infusion of 150-710 mg/kg/day for up to eight weeks, reported only one patient with stable disease who continued therapy for 48 weeks. [108](#B108-nutrients-13-00735)] presented complete remission after sole IVC administration of 15-65 g twice a week in two patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and in one patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving IVC in monotherapy after the chemotherapy was stopped due to side effects. Authors also presented one case of resolution of skull metastases in a disseminated end-stage breast cancer patient receiving vitamin C in doses of 100 g three times a week and no recurrence in a woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diffuse large cleaved cell of B-cell lineage) receiving IVC as the only treatment after completed radiotherapy [ [108](#B108-nutrients-13-00735)]. 8. Does High-Dose IVC Increase the Effectiveness of Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced-Stage Cancer? [35](#B35-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, animal studies have indicated that concomitant administration of vitamin C with many chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy works synergistically, resulting in a decreased tumor size and weight rates and increased survival as well [ [25](#B25-nutrients-13-00735)]. To evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose IVC therapy as an agent enhancing chemosensitivity of cancer cells in the advanced stage of malignancy, we compiled the results of clinical trials conducted so far in this area. We analyzed only those studies, where study participants had advanced malignancies with distant metastases or refractory to standard anti-cancer therapy. By searching the database, we identified only one non-blinded randomized controlled trial meeting the above criteria (n = 25 ovarian stage III and IV cancer patients) [ [31](#B31-nutrients-13-00735)], two nonrandomized phase I studies conducted among patients with disseminated pancreatic cancer (n = 25) [ [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735), [32](#B32-nutrients-13-00735)], and three phase I or II trials conducted among patients with drug-resistant multiple myeloma (n = 68) [ [109](#B109-nutrients-13-00735), [110](#B110-nutrients-13-00735), [111](#B111-nutrients-13-00735), [112](#B112-nutrients-13-00735)]. [31](#B31-nutrients-13-00735)] conducted a clinical trial assessing effectiveness and toxicity of such treatment in patients with stage III and IV ovarian cancer. Study participants were randomized into either the standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy administered for the initial six months (n = 12) or the paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy administered for six months with the concomitant ascorbate treatment for 12 months (n = 13). Although overall survival tended to be improved based on the Kaplan-Maier analysis, and the median time for disease progression was 8.75 months longer with ascorbate addition to standard chemotherapy than in chemotherapy alone, neither therapy achieved statistical significance [ [31](#B31-nutrients-13-00735)]. [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735)] and Monti et al. [ [32](#B32-nutrients-13-00735)] observed some efficacy of IVC administration in combination with gemcitabine and gemcitabine/erlotinib in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (reduction in size of the primary tumor in imaging tests, improved performance status, median overall survival of 13 months and 182 days, respectively). However, these studies were carried out on a small sample size (nine subjects who completed the study in both trials), which does not allow for unambiguous statistical conclusions regarding the advantage of such management over the use of chemotherapy alone. [109](#B109-nutrients-13-00735)] conducted a phase I clinical trial to evaluate effectiveness and toxicity of such combined therapy in the group of six patients with stage IIIA relapsed or refractory MM. It was observed that the co-administration of 1 g IVC following the As2O3 infusion five days a week for five consecutive weeks followed by two weeks of rest (patients were allowed to receive a maximum of six cycles) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of arsenic trioxide with acceptable toxicity. Two patients had partial responses and four patients presented a stable disease [ [109](#B109-nutrients-13-00735)]. Similar observations were achieved by other researchers studying efficacy and safety of IVC administration in combination with standard treatment in patients with resistant MM. Abou-Jawde et al. [ [110](#B110-nutrients-13-00735)] and Wu et al. [ [111](#B111-nutrients-13-00735)], in a phase II clinical trial, conducted among groups of 20 patients receiving the combination of arsenic trioxide, dexamethasone, and intravenously administered 1 g ascorbic acid, observed the overall response rate in 30% and 6%, respectively, with median overall survival of 962 days and 11 months and progression-free survival of 316 days and 4 months, respectively. Berenson et al. [ [112](#B112-nutrients-13-00735)] observed an objective response in 27% of 22 study participants receiving the combination of arsenic trioxide, bortezomib, and ascorbic acid with median progression free-survival of 5 months, 12-month progression-free survival, and overall survival rates of 34% and 74%, respectively. [108](#B108-nutrients-13-00735)] in a clinical report presented one case of complete remission in a patient with stage IV colorectal carcinoma receiving combined chemotherapy (5-FU/Leucovorin) with 100 g IVC weekly and one case of no disease progression in a patient with metastatic low-grade mucinous carcinoma of pancreas undergoing chemotherapy in combination with 75 g IVC weekly. 9. Does High-Dose IVC Reduce the Chemotherapy-Induced Toxicity in Patients with Advanced-Stage Cancer? [31](#B31-nutrients-13-00735)] and six non-randomized phase I or II = 93) [ [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735), [32](#B32-nutrients-13-00735), [109](#B109-nutrients-13-00735), [110](#B110-nutrients-13-00735), [111](#B111-nutrients-13-00735), [112](#B112-nutrients-13-00735)]. Study participants of analyzed had advanced malignancies with distant metastases or disease refractory to standard anti-cancer therapy. [31](#B31-nutrients-13-00735)] reported that the addition of ascorbic acid to standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy in stage III and IV ovarian cancer patients reduced chemotherapy-induced toxicity. IVC treatment did not increase the rate of graded 3 or 4 toxicities using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (CTCAEv3) and there were also no observed grade 5 treatment-related toxicities (death). Moreover, the authors proved that grade 1 and grade 2 toxicities (such as neurotoxicity, bone marrow toxicity, infections, hepatobiliary/pancreatic toxicity, dermatological toxicity, and toxicities in the skin, renal, genitourinary, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems) were significantly decreased in the group receiving ascorbic acid with standard chemotherapy when compared to sole chemotherapy. Unfortunately, they did not show detailed data about all the categories of cytotoxicity evaluated [ [31](#B31-nutrients-13-00735)]. [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735), [32](#B32-nutrients-13-00735)]. None of the adverse effects observed during these studies appeared to be specifically attributed to the ascorbic acid treatment since each of these adverse events is frequently recorded in the progression of pancreatic cancer patients and/or gemcitabine for these toxicities induced by gemcitabine alone [ [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735)], while laboratory toxicities (elevated GGT, hypocalcemia) and serious adverse events, such as internal bleeding, ileus, and death, were likely related to the disease progression [ [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735), [32](#B32-nutrients-13-00735)]. In addition, in the studies evaluating the safety of IVC administered simultaneously with the standard treatment of drug-resistant [111](#B111-nutrients-13-00735), [112](#B112-nutrients-13-00735)]. 10. Life in Advanced-Stage Cancer Patients? [113](#B113-nutrients-13-00735)]. [114](#B114-nutrients-13-00735)]. It covers the subjective perception of the positive and negative aspects of cancer symptoms, physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functions and side effects of treatment [ [115](#B115-nutrients-13-00735)]. QoL is usually seen as a composite of a life situation in relation to the culture in which individuals live, their system of values, goals, expectations, and interests [ [116](#B116-nutrients-13-00735)]. [117](#B117-nutrients-13-00735)]. The remaining part contains questions about additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial impact of the disease and treatment [ [117](#B117-nutrients-13-00735)]. The measures range in score from 0 to 100, with a difference of 4-10 points representing a small change, and a difference of 10-20 points representing a medium change in QOL [ [117](#B117-nutrients-13-00735)]. [118](#B118-nutrients-13-00735)]. Among terminal cancer patients at hospices, the prevalence of patients with low QoL is about 50% [ [119](#B119-nutrients-13-00735)]. The analysis of QoL in hospices indicated a number of significant predictors of poor outcome, such as socio-demographic characteristics (marital status, occupation, and education), and also psycho-physical phenomena, such as pain, anxiety, faith, and instrumental support [ [119](#B119-nutrients-13-00735)]. Identification of factors improving QoL is of particular importance in the advanced stage of neoplastic disease. [102](#B102-nutrients-13-00735)] observed a significant improvement in the QoL assessed by the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire after two and four weeks of high-dose IVC therapy in patients with newly diagnosed cancer. The better QoL resulted not only from the improved self-assessed global health status and functioning, but also from the reduction of fatigue, pain, insomnia, and constipation intensity [ [102](#B102-nutrients-13-00735)]. Similarly, Vollbracht et al. [ [105](#B105-nutrients-13-00735)] demonstrated that the administration of IVC with standard anti-cancer therapy in the first postoperative year of women with breast cancer resulted in significantly enhanced performance status and reduction of complaints induced by the disease and chemo-radiotherapy. [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735), [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735), [29](#B29-nutrients-13-00735), [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)] and two case reports (n = 2 participants) [ [121](#B121-nutrients-13-00735), [122](#B122-nutrients-13-00735)]. All participants of analyzed studies had advanced malignancies with distant metastases or cancer disease refractory to standard anti-cancer therapy. [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)] noticed statistically significant improvement in quality of life assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire after double intravenous administration of 10 g vitamin C with a 3-day interval followed by oral intake of 4 g vitamin C daily for a week. The study was performed in terminal cancer patients in whom anti-cancer therapy was no longer conducted. Improvement in QoL was observed in patients' self-evaluation of their global health and quality of life (global health scale) as well as all aspects of functioning (function scale): in the physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social field. Moreover, study participants observed statistically significant reduction of intensity of some symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, sleep disturbance, and loss of appetite [ [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)]. In a phase I clinical trial by Stephenson et al. [ [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735)], high-dose IVC was applied as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. The average values for the functioning and symptom scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 remained constant for the first two weeks of therapy with a trend to improve for those few patients, who completed the questionnaire at the 3rd and 4th weeks (n = 7 and n = 2, respectively) [ [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735)]. Unfortunately, the authors of the study did not demonstrate statistical significance of those changes. Improved QoL, together with simultaneously reduced intensity of symptoms and fatigue, was reported also by Carr et al. [ [121](#B121-nutrients-13-00735), [122](#B122-nutrients-13-00735)] in patients with recurrent cancers. [29](#B29-nutrients-13-00735)] in a phase I dose-escalating trial of IVC in patients with advanced malignancy refractory to standard therapy, observed a significant deterioration in patients' physical condition over the course of the study, assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire. Interestingly, the above observation was made only for patients who received IVC in a dose of 0.4 g/kg, while there was no deterioration of physical condition among patients who received higher doses of ascorbic acid. No changes in the social, emotional, and functional parameters of QoL were reported in any cohort of the study [ [29](#B29-nutrients-13-00735)]. Similarly, Nielsen et al. [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735)] in a single-center phase II clinical trial in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients found a significant deterioration in physical functioning with no trends towards improvement for the other QoL scales. What is more, 80% of study participants had an unchanged ECOG score at the 12th week of the study, while it improved in two patients and aggravated in another two compared to baseline [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735)]. [25](#B25-nutrients-13-00735)]. Some researchers emphasize the positive impact of ascorbate on the central nervous system, mental skills, and contribution to enhanced vigor [ [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)]. Effects of intravenous vitamin C on QoL in the context of performance status and severity of symptoms in cancer patients are presented in [Table 1](#nutrients-13-00735-t001). 11. Does High-Dose IVC Affect the Cancer-Related Fatigue Advanced-Stage Cancer Patients? [124](#B124-nutrients-13-00735)]. Cancer patients affected by CRF vary widely in their manner of expressing the problem, describing CRF as a feeling of exhaustion, lack of energy, loss of drive and personal interests, as well as impaired memory and concentration [ [125](#B125-nutrients-13-00735)]. CRF involves a vicious circle of diminished physical performance, inactivity, avoidance of effort, absence of regeneration, helplessness, and depressed mood [ [125](#B125-nutrients-13-00735)] and differs from other types of fatigue by its persistence, intensity, and the inability to be alleviated after resting or sleeping [ [124](#B124-nutrients-13-00735)]. Prevalence of CRF as the most common symptom experienced by cancer patients is estimated to range from 60 to 90%, depending on patients sampling and application of methodology used [ [126](#B126-nutrients-13-00735), [127](#B127-nutrients-13-00735)]. Up to 40% of patients report fatigue at the time of cancer diagnosis and about 80-90% experience CRF during chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [ [124](#B124-nutrients-13-00735)]. What is more, it may persist for years after anti-cancer treatment has finished [ [128](#B128-nutrients-13-00735)]. In the palliative care setting, CRF is described as a \"clinically important\" to \"severe\" problem by 48-75% patients [ [126](#B126-nutrients-13-00735)], thus it is a main cause of disruption in all aspects of patients' quality of life [ [128](#B128-nutrients-13-00735)]. [124](#B124-nutrients-13-00735)]. However, the studies carried out so far revealed that IVC alone or in combination with other medications such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) reduces fatigue in healthy office workers [ [129](#B129-nutrients-13-00735)] and postoperative fatigue among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery as well [ [130](#B130-nutrients-13-00735)]. Some studies conducted so far among cancer patients seem to be promising and worth mentioning. [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735), [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735), [29](#B29-nutrients-13-00735), [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)], one controlled retrospective study (n = 39 participants), [ [123](#B123-nutrients-13-00735)] and two case reports (n = 2 participants) [ [121](#B121-nutrients-13-00735), [122](#B122-nutrients-13-00735)]. Admittedly, we analyzed the effect of high-dose IVC on CRF in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. For this purpose, we identified two studies meeting these criteria, including 185 patients: one prospective study with 60 participants [ [102](#B102-nutrients-13-00735)] and one controlled retrospective study conducted among 125 breast cancer patients [ [105](#B105-nutrients-13-00735)]. [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)]. Similar observations were made by Stephenson et al. [ [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735)], however no data on statistical significance was provided in the study. Gunes-Bayir et al. [ [123](#B123-nutrients-13-00735)], in a controlled retrospective study, observed improved performance status in 27% of patients with metastatic, radiotherapy-resistant malignancies after IVC therapy and in 7% of those undertaken chemotherapy, respectively. In the control group, receiving no intervention, performance status worsened during the study [ [123](#B123-nutrients-13-00735)]. On the other hand, Nielsen et al. [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735)] found no change in subjective fatigue intensity in advanced prostate cancer patients, but observed a significant (p < 0.01) deterioration in physician functioning after 12 weeks of IVC administration. Details of the above mentioned studies are shown in [Table 1](#nutrients-13-00735-t001). [102](#B102-nutrients-13-00735)], patients with newly diagnosed cancer, with anti-cancer therapy administered in 57% cases, reported statistically lower fatigue intensity (p < 0.01) accompanied by improvement in physical (p < 0.05) as well as role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks of IVC therapy. The positive impact of high-dose IVC on patients' performance status was also demonstrated by Vollbracht et al. [ [105](#B105-nutrients-13-00735)] in the epidemiological retrospective study with 125 women with primary non-metastasized breast cancer, receiving a basic anti-tumor therapy with IVC at a dose of 7.5 g once a week for at least 4 weeks. Women who received IVC had a significantly better performance status during adjuvant therapy and the aftercare follow-up than those who did not receive IVC. During the 6th month of adjuvant treatment, the mean score of the Karnofsky index in a study group was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the control group (80% vs. 71%, respectively) and the mean score of the European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status scale was significantly lower (1.596 in a study group vs. 2.067 in the control group, p = 0.002), which proved the positive effect of vitamin C on patients' functional status [ [105](#B105-nutrients-13-00735)]. [124](#B124-nutrients-13-00735)]. It was observed that cancer patients present with elevated inflammatory and angiogenesis compared to healthy controls [ [52](#B52-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, it has been shown that high-dose IVC (15-50 g up to three times a week) resulted in reduced CRP levels (in 76 \u00b1 13% of study participants) concentration of [52](#B52-nutrients-13-00735)]. Thus, the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin C may be responsible for the fatigue-relieving effect. [131](#B131-nutrients-13-00735), [132](#B132-nutrients-13-00735)]. Vitamin C is well known as a potent antioxidant possessing the ability to scavenge free radicals and reactive oxygen species, thus decreasing markers of oxidative stress in vivo [ [133](#B133-nutrients-13-00735)]. High tissue levels of ascorbate may provide antioxidant protection from this oxidant-mediated toxicity observed in cancer patients [ [131](#B131-nutrients-13-00735)]. As an essential micronutrient in the central nervous system (CNS), vitamin C serves important functions including antioxidant protection, peptide amidation, myelin formation, and synaptic potentiation [ [134](#B134-nutrients-13-00735)]. It can have a beneficial impact on CNS through an increase in brain c-AMP levels and prevention of the formation of toxic oxidative forms of some neurotransmitters (such as epinephrine or norepinephrine) [ [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, acting as a cofactor in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, ascorbate participates in maintaining their proper concentrations in CNS [ [133](#B133-nutrients-13-00735)]. All above mentioned mechanisms might be important in improving the performance status and physical functioning in patients with CRF. [131](#B131-nutrients-13-00735)]. Therefore, the impaired carnitine metabolism (because of insufficient vitamin C supplementation or excessive use in states of pathology) can be responsible for weakness [ [108](#B108-nutrients-13-00735)]. Therefore the improvement in functioning scales and reduction in intensity of fatigue reported by cancer patients after intravenous vitamin C supplementation might result from the improvement in plasma vitamin C saturation. 12. Potential Analgesic Properties of High-Dose Vitamin C in Cancer-Related Pain [135](#B135-nutrients-13-00735)]. Cancer pain can be related to primary tumor, disease progression, and metastasis as well as to anti-cancer therapy and its complications. Despite increased attention on assessment and management of pain in the last decade, its prevalence and intensity still remain substantial. Pain is reported by 66.4% of patients in advanced, metastatic, or terminal disease, 55% of cancer patients during anticancer therapy and 39% of subjects after anticancer treatment [ [135](#B135-nutrients-13-00735)]. What is more, 38% of all cancer patients experience moderate to severe pain, which indicates the need for development and implementation of new interventions providing optimal management of cancer-related pain [ [135](#B135-nutrients-13-00735)]. The nature of cancer-associated pain is usually complex, consists of nociceptive, neuropathic, and inflammatory components, thus requiring a complex approach and treatment with the use of analgesics with different mechanisms of action, such as opiate receptor agonists, acetaminophen, and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in combination adjuvant drugs (co-analgesics). The term \"adjuvant analgesic\" or \"co-analgesic\" concerns any drug with a major clinical use other than pain that is helpful as an analgesic in certain circumstances, providing additional analgesia in specific types of pain (e.g., antiepileptics, gabapentin, and pregabalin, are indicated as first-line therapy for neuropathic pain). Taking into account the following biological properties of vitamin C, it may be one of nutraceuticals used in palliative care as \"adjuvant analgesic\". [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735)]. It is presented mainly with arthralgia or myalgia, primarily due to bleeding into musculoskeletal tissues (muscles and joints) [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-00735), [136](#B136-nutrients-13-00735)]. Data from epidemiological study conducted by Dionne et al. [ [137](#B137-nutrients-13-00735)] among 4742 healthy participants aged 20 years revealed the association between suboptimal vitamin C plasma concentration and spinal pain occurrence. It proves that the pain reported by cancer patients, mainly the one referred to musculoskeletal system may be related both to the cancer itself and/or its treatment, but also in some cases, to vitamin C deficiency. Studies conducted so far among cancer patients have indicated that high-dose IVC in some circumstances might exert analgesic effects. [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735)] were the first who reported in 1974 a reduction in pain intensity in terminal cancer patients receiving intravenous ascorbic acid for a period of no longer than 10 days (details are shown in [Table 2](#nutrients-13-00735-t002)). In a subsequent prospective study conducted in the 2007 by Yeom et al. [ [120](#B120-nutrients-13-00735)], a significant alleviation of pain was observed among 39 terminal cancer patients after IVC administration in monotherapy. Similar analgesic effect of IVC was observed in 60 patients with newly diagnosed cancer (56% on anti-cancer treatment) at the 4th week of IVC therapy (25-100 g weekly) [ [102](#B102-nutrients-13-00735)]. Stephenson et al. [ [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735)], in a prospective study with 17 patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, observed a gradual reduction in pain intensity until its complete disappearance at the 4th week of IVC therapy, but no statistical analysis was performed in the study. Carr et al. [ [121](#B121-nutrients-13-00735), [122](#B122-nutrients-13-00735)] presented two case reports demonstrating improvement in a control of pain after IVC therapy. Details of above mentioned studies are shown in [Table 2](#nutrients-13-00735-t002). [52](#B52-nutrients-13-00735), [53](#B53-nutrients-13-00735)] that high-dose IVC may reduce inflammation in cancer patients, and these anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin C may play a key role in certain clinical situations, such as cancer-induced bone pain. In the area of bony metastases, a wide range of pro-hyperalgesic mediators commonly associated with inflammation is released from the tumor and related immune cells, all of which are likely to contribute to cancer-induced bone pain. Prostaglandins, endothelins, bradykinin, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and a range of growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF-) not only sensitize peripheral nociceptors to subsequent stimuli, but also have a direct impact on specific receptors on the primary sensory neurons. Several clinical studies conducted so far have revealed a significant reduction in bone pain in cancer patients with bone metastases after IVC treatment, thus confirming these assumptions. The majority of patients with partial or even complete resolution of pain in a study of Cameron and Campbel [ [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735)] were those with bone pain. In addition, G\u00fcnes-Bayir et al. [ [123](#B123-nutrients-13-00735)] and Kiziltan et al. [ [138](#B138-nutrients-13-00735)], in retrospective studies, found about 50% reduction in pain intensity among patients with radiotherapy-resistant bone metastases after IVC administration. [139](#B139-nutrients-13-00735)]. Its analgesic properties might be related to participation in the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters [ [136](#B136-nutrients-13-00735)]. Vitamin C is a cofactor for the enzyme dopamine -hydroxylase which converts dopamine into norepinephrine. It may be also involved in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin [ [136](#B136-nutrients-13-00735), [140](#B140-nutrients-13-00735)]. Recent studies of animal models of neuropathic pain indicated that noradrenaline plays a special role in the central inhibition of neuropathic pain; additionally, this effect may be amplified by serotonin and dopamine [ [141](#B141-nutrients-13-00735)]. Noradrenaline in the spinal cord directly inhibits neuropathic pain through 2-adrenergic receptors [ [141](#B141-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, increased noradrenaline concentration acts on the locus coeruleus and improves the function of the impaired descending noradrenergic inhibitory system [ [141](#B141-nutrients-13-00735)], which is crucial in the central control of pain. In ascorbate-deficient laboratory animals, decreased norepinephrine concentrations were found [ [136](#B136-nutrients-13-00735)]. No such correlation has been investigated in human studies, however it was revealed that vitamin C deficiency possibly increases the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Plasma concentrations of vitamin C were significantly lower in patients with PHN than in healthy volunteers [ [142](#B142-nutrients-13-00735), [143](#B143-nutrients-13-00735), [144](#B144-nutrients-13-00735)]. Moreover, ascorbate supplementation effectively restored plasma vitamin C concentrations with concomitant decrease in spontaneous pain related to PHN [ [142](#B142-nutrients-13-00735)]. As postherpetic neuralgia is an example of neuropathic pain, an observed effect of ascorbic acid may additionally explain the validity of IVC supplementation as a co-analgesic in cancer patients, especially in states of vitamin C deficiency and in such a type of pain. Furthermore, animal models of neuropathic pain demonstrated that vitamin C can enhance gabapentin analgesic effect [ [145](#B145-nutrients-13-00735), [146](#B146-nutrients-13-00735)]. Ascorbic acid given alone was also able to produce a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect [ potent opioid therefore vitamin C can act as an opioid-sparing agent when used as adjuvant therapy in the management of chronic cancer-related pain [ [149](#B149-nutrients-13-00735)]. It is supported by the results of the observational study by Cameron and Campbel [ [7](#B7-nutrients-13-00735)] that vitamin C administration reduced requirement for opioid analgesics with no further need for opioids in some cases. 13. Safety of High-Dose Vitamin C Treatment in Advanced-Stage Cancer Patients [150](#B150-nutrients-13-00735), [151](#B151-nutrients-13-00735)]. For this reason, red blood cell G6PD screening is required before applying vitamin C therapy. However, even when administered orally, vitamin C might induce hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [ [152](#B152-nutrients-13-00735)]. On the other hand, because the metabolic end-product of vitamin C is oxalate, an acute oxalate nephropathy has been observed, especially when gram doses of IVC were given as a prolonged treatment in patients with chronic renal disease [ [153](#B153-nutrients-13-00735), [154](#B154-nutrients-13-00735)]. It can also worsen iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis or those who receive repeated transfusions of concentrated red blood cells [ [23](#B23-nutrients-13-00735)]. Unfortunately, there is no clear data on adverse effects and possible high-dose IVC-induced toxicities among patients with cancer cachexia and those presenting features of dehydration who constitute a high percentage of end-stage disease patients. [32](#B32-nutrients-13-00735)]. Transient treatment-related vomiting, thirst, dry mouth and skin, increased urinary flow, diarrhea, and headache, alleviating within the same day as infusion, were most frequently reported [ [26](#B26-nutrients-13-00735), [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735), [30](#B30-nutrients-13-00735), [58](#B58-nutrients-13-00735)]. Some patients experienced unpleasant fluttering sensation in the upper abdomen and chills during the IVC infusion and increased leg edema for a few days after each infusion [ [26](#B26-nutrients-13-00735)]. Among other complaints, hypertension, insomnia, abnormal urine color, loss of appetite, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, facial flushing, and perspiration were reported [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735), [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735), [102](#B102-nutrients-13-00735)] (details are shown in [Table 3](#nutrients-13-00735-t003).). Moderate to severe laboratory abnormalities, such as hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and low hemoglobin count were also observed [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-00735), [28](#B28-nutrients-13-00735), [58](#B58-nutrients-13-00735)]. Single serious adverse events observed during vitamin C treatment, such as pulmonary embolism and pneumonia rather seem to be related to cancer progression and subsequent complications than result from IVC treatment. 14. Summary [2](#B2-nutrients-13-00735)]. Results obtained from in vitro studies demonstrated that millimolar ascorbate plasma concentrations, achievable only after intravenous vitamin C (IVC) administration, were cytotoxic to the fast-growing malignant cells and enhanced anti-cancer effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Although these results were very promising and consistent with data obtained from animal studies, where injections of high-dose vitamin C inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of laboratory animals, both high-dose IVC sole treatment and IVC in combination with standard chemotherapy were found ineffective in human studies conducted in advanced-stage cancer patients.
