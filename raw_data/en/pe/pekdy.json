PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES F lorida's current 1115 demonstration allows the state to operate a comprehensive Medicaid managed care program and a Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP). Under the demonstration, most Medicaid-eligibles are required to enroll in one of the MMA managed care plans (MMA plans) contracted with the state under the MMA Program. MMA plans are MCOs as defined under 42 CFR 438.2. Several populations may also voluntarily enroll in the MMA program. Applicants for Medicaid are given the opportunity to select a MMA plan prior to receiving a Florida Medicaid eligibility dete rmination. If they do not choose a plan, they are auto-assigned into a MMA plan upon an affirmative eligibility determination and subsequently provided with information about their choice of plans with the auto- assignment. MMA plans are able to provide cus tomized benefits to their members that differ from, but are not less than, the state plan benefits \u2014and participating Medicaid -eligibles have access to Healthy Behaviors Programs that provide incentives for healthy behaviors. A dditionally, upon implementation of the prepaid dental health program (PDHP), dental managed care plans (dental plans) will provide State Plan dental services and provide services statewide to recipients required to enroll in a dental plan. The dental plans are PAHPs as defined under 42 CFR 438.2. T he demonstration also establishes a Low -Income Pool (LIP) to ensure continuing support for the safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care (UC) to uninsured populations.1 T he renewal approved in August 2017 allowed the state to continue operating the MMA program while increasing the LIP to $1.5 billion annually. This prior renewal also removed historical information about implementation of the MMA program from the STCs and modified the frequency of state-reported demonstration act ivities \u2014based on the long-standing nature of the demonstration, the consistency in its operations, and the lack of significant issues or corrective actions needed. All reporting modifications , at that time, provided CMS and the public with the information necessary to effectively monitor and evaluate the MMA demonstration. 1 1 For the \"Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives,\" see Attachment B. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 3 of 95 On November 30, 2018, an amendment was approved to the demonstration that, allows the state to operate a statewide Prepaid Dental Health Program, modifies the LIP to add Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Centers (RPICCs) as an eligible hospital ownership subgroup and community behavioral health providers as a participating provider group, and waives retroactive eligibility for all beneficiaries under the demonstration, except for pregnant individuals , individuals within the state -authorized postpartum coverage period, and beneficiaries under age 21 (non- pregnant adults). The approval of the waiver of retroactive eligibility will encourage Medicaid beneficiaries to obtain and maintain health coverage, even when healthy, or to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible (if eligibility depends on a finding of disability or a certain diagnosis). On March 26, 2019, an amendment was approved to the demonstration to i mpleme nt a pilot program that provides additional behavioral health services and supportive housing assistance services for persons aged 21 and older with serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD) or SMI with co -occurring SUD, who are homeless o r at risk of homelessness due to their disability. The pilot program will be operated in two regions of the State , Regions 5 (Pasco and Pinellas counties) and Region 7 (Brevard, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties). On February 18, 2020, an amendment wa s approved to the demonstration that enables Florida to increase the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance services annual enrollment limit, modify the LIP permissible expenditures related to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Rura l Health Clinics (RHC), and memorialize s some budget neutrality -related edits to the Supportive Housing Pilot table. On January 15, 2021 the demonstration was extended through June 30, 2030 with the following changes: Clarified budget neutrality rebasing will occur in demonstration year DY17 and DY 22; Modified the LIP by requiring essential providers to make a good faith effort to contract with each managed care plan in the state, resizing the pool amount, aligning the date of LIP reconciliation, and requiring more frequent periodic monitoring calls with CMS ; Adde d needs -based criteria for populations for which services under the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot may be appropriate; Extended the behavioral health and supportive hous ing assistance pilot through June 30, 2025; and Updated evaluation requirements for the waiver of retroactive eligibility, including a revised Evaluation Design and a Monitoring Protocol, which describes the metrics the state will report quarterly and annually throughout the demonstration extension period. In accordance with the passage of Florida Senate Bills (SB) 2500 and SB 2518, on September 20, 2021, Florida submitted an amendment to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months following the last day of p regnancy, to allow certain non- profit licensed behavioral health providers to be eligible to receive LIP, and to remove the administrative requirement for Florida to submit a letter to CMS each year following the legislative session reauthorizing the waive r of retroactive eligibility as well as the essential provider contracting requirement . On March 14, 2022, in response to discussions with CMS, the state received additional legislative authority, Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 4 of 95 under Senate Bill 2526, to also extend the 12 months of postpartum coverage to pregnant individuals enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP ), to align with the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ( ARP ) (Pub. L. 117-2). On the effective date described in the expenditure authority associated with this amendment approval, Florida will have authority to extend state plan coverage to 12 months for postpartum individuals in both Medicaid and CHIP in accordance with s ection s 9812 and 9822 of the ARP. For Medicaid, the extended postpartum coverage will be provided to postpartum individuals who have household income up to 191 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). For CHIP, the extended postpartum coverage will be provided to postpartum individuals with family income from 134 up to and including 210 percent of the FPL. Section 9812 and 9822 of the ARP requires states who elect to extend 12 months of postpartum coverage to extend such coverage in both Medicaid and CHIP. The state will also provide continuous eligibility for these individuals during the entire postpartum period in accordance with the ARP , ensuring continuity of coverage. The approval also allows for certain non-profit licensed behavioral health providers to be eligible to receive funding from the uncompensated care pool, known in Florida as the Low - Income Pool. Under the demonstration, Florida seeks to continue building on the following objectives: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The demonstration seeks to improve care for Medicaid beneficiaries by providing care through nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state wil l provide oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality of care. Improving program performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS] scores) , through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care, continuity of care, and continuity of coverage by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care in a timely manner, except those specifically exempted. Increasing access to, stabilizing, and strengthening providers that serve uninsured, low-income populations in the state by targeting LIP funding to reimburse UC costs for services provided to low-income uninsured patients at hospitals, FQHC s and RHC that are furnished through charity care programs that adhere to the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) principles. 2 Improving continuity of coverage and care and encouraging uptake of preventive services, or en couraging individuals to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible, as applicable, as well as promoting the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program, through the waiver of retroactive eligibility. 2 Available at http://www.hfma.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=14589 Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 5 of 95 Improving integration of all services, increased care coordination effectiveness, increased individual involvement in their care, improved health outcomes, and reductions in unnecessary or inefficient use of health care .

Medicare- Medicaid Eligible Participants - Individuals fully eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid are required to enroll in an MMA plan for covered Medicaid services. These individuals will continue to have their choice of Medicare providers as this program will not impact individuals' Medicare benefits. M edicare- Medicaid beneficiaries will be afforded the opportunity to choose an MMA plan. However, to facilitate enrollment, if the individual does not elect an MMA plan, then the individual will be assigned to an MMA plan by the state using the criteria outlined in STC 24. c. Voluntary enrollees - The following individuals are excluded from mandatory enrollment into the MMA program under subparagraph (a) but may choose to voluntarily enroll under the demonstration, in which case the individual would be a voluntary participant in an MMA plan and would receive its benefits: i.

Indian Health Care Providers and Managed Care Protections. a. The state will assure compliance by the state with the requirements of section 1911 of the Social Security Act and 25 USC \u00a71647a(a)(1), to accept an entity that is operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or urban Indian health program as a provider eligible to receive payment under the program for health care services furnished to an Indian on the same basis as any other provider qualified to participate as a provider of health care services under the program, if the entity meets generally applicable State or other requirements for participation as a provider of health care services under the program. b. The state will assure compliance by the state with 42 CFR 431.110(b), which specifies that an IHS facility meeting state requirements for Medicaid participation must be accepted as a Medicaid provider on the same basis as any other qualified provider, and also specifies that when state licensure is normally required, the facility need not obtain a license but must meet all applicable standards for licensure. In determinin g whether a facility meets these standards, the state may not take into Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 17 of 95 account an absence of licensure of any staff member of the facility. VI. ENROLLMENT This section describes enrollment provisions that are applicable to Medicaid- eligible individuals in Medicaid managed care plans. All Medicaid recipients, except those specified in STC 55, must enroll in the Prepaid Dental Health Program (PDHP) in order to receive dental services covered under the Florida Medicaid program. The state will implement the PDHP in three phases by region, beginning December 1, 2018, with completion by March 1, 2019. 23. New Enrollees. 42 CFR \u00a7 438.71 requires choice counseling as part of the beneficiary support system. At the time of their application for Medicaid, individuals who are mandated to enroll in an MMA or dental plan must receive information about MMA and dental plan choices in their area. They must be informed of their options in selecting an authorized MMA/dental plan. Individuals must be provided the opportunity to meet or speak with a choice counselor to obtain additional information in making a choice, and to indicate a plan choice selection if they are prepared to d o so. Eligible individuals will be enrol led in a MMA and dental plan upon eligibility determination. If the individual has not selected a plan at the time of the approval of eligibility, the state may auto -assign the individual into a MMA/dental plan. Upon enrollment, individuals will receive information on their MMA and dental plan assignments or selection and information about all plans in their area. Individuals may actively select a plan or change their plan selection during a 120- day change/disenrollme nt period without cause post -enrollment. All individuals will be provided with information regarding their rights to change plans. Once the plan selection is registered and takes effect, the plan must communicate to the enrollee, in accordance with 42 CFR 438.10, the benefits covered under the plan, and how to access those benefits. 24. Auto -Enrollment Criteria. Each enrollee must have an opportunity to select a MMA and dental plan before or upon being determined eligible. Individuals must be provided informat ion to encourage an active selection electronically or in print. Enrollees who fail to choose a plan by the time their eligibility is determined will be auto -assigned to a MMA and/or dental plan. At a minimum, the state must use the criteria listed below w hen assigning an enrollee to a MMA or dental plan, in addition to criteria identified in 42 CFR 438.54. When more than one plan meets the assignment criteria, the state will make enrollee assignments consecutively by family unit. MMA criteria include but are not limited to: a. Whether the plan has sufficient provider network capacity to meet the needs of the enrollee; b. Whether the recipient has previously received services from one of the plan's primary care providers; and Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 18 of 95 c. Whether primary care providers in one plan are more geographically accessible to the recipient's residence than those in other plans. PDHP criteria include but are not limited to: a. Whether the plan has sufficient network capacity to meet the needs of the recipients such as geographic accessibility based on beneficiary's residence; b. Whether the recipient has a family member enrolled in one of the PDHP plans. c. A newborn of a mother enrolled in a plan at the time of the child's birth shall be enrolled in the mother's plan. Upon birth, such a newborn is deemed enrolled in the dental plan, regardless of the administrative enrollment procedures, and the dental plan i s responsible for providing Medicaid services to the newborn. The mother may choose another dental plan for the newborn within 120 days after the child's birth. 25. Auto Enrollment for Special Populations. For an enrollee who is also a recipient of Supplement al Security Income (SSI), prior to auto -assigning the SSI beneficiary to an MMA plan, the state must determine whether the SSI beneficiary has an ongoing relationship with a provider or managed care plan; and if so in addition to complying with \u00a7 438.54(d) , the state must assign the SSI recipient to that managed care plan whenever feasible. Assignment based on an ongoing relationship with a provider or managed care plan is the first priority in assigning enrollees pursuant to this STC. Those SSI recipients who do not have such a provider relationship must be assigned to a managed care plan using the assignment criteria previously outlined. In addition to complying with \u00a7 438.54(d), the state must use the following parameters when auto -assigning recipients w ho are members of the indicated special populations to a plan. The analogous requirements for auto enrollment into both MMA and PDHP plans are mentioned above in STC 24. a. To promote alignment between Medicaid and Medicare, each beneficiary who is enrolled with a Medicare Advantage Organization, must first be assigned to any MMA plan in the beneficiary's region that is operated by the same parent organization as the beneficiary's Medicare Advantage Organization. If there is no match of parent organization or plan within the organization, then the beneficiary should be assigned as in sub-STC 2 4 above. b. If an applicable specialty plan is available, as described in STC 37, the recipient should be assigned to the specialty plan. c. Newborns of eligible mothers enrolled in a plan at the time of the child's birth will be automatically enrolled in that plan, unless it is a specialty plan; however, the mother may choose another plan for the newborn within 120 days after the child's birth . Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 19 of 95 d. Foster care children will be assigned/re -assigned to the same plan to which the child was most recently assigned in the last 12 months, if applicable. e. Lock -In/Disenrollment. Once a mandatory enrollee has selected or been assigned an MMA or dental plan, the enrollee shall be enrolled for a total of 12 months, until the next open enrollment period, unless the individual is determined ineligible for Medicai d. The 12- month period includes a 120 -day period to change or voluntarily disenroll from a plan without cause and select another plan. If an individual chooses to remain in a plan past 120 days, the individual will be permitted no further changes in enroll ment until the next open enrollment period, except for cause. Good cause r easons for disenrollment from a plan are defined in Rule 59- G-8.600, Florida Administrative Code. Voluntary enrollees may disenroll from the MMA plan at any time and enroll in anothe r managed care plan or receive their services through Florida FFS Medicaid. This Florida rule is compliant with \u00a7 438.56(c) and (d)(2). f. The choice counselor or state will record the plan change/disenrollment reason for all recipients who request such a change. The state or the state's designee will be responsible for processing all enrollments and disenrollments . 26. Re-enrollment. In instances of a temporary loss of Medicaid eligibility, which the state is defining as 6 months or less, the state will re -enroll demonstration enrollees in the same MMA or dental plan they were enrolled in prior to the temporary loss of eligibility unless enrollment into the entity has been suspended due to plan requested or Agency - imposed enrollment freeze. The individual will have the same change/disenrollment period without cause as upon initial enrollment. VII. BENEFIT PACKAGES AND PLANS IN THE MMA PROGRAM 27. Customized Benefit Packages . MMA plans have the flexibility to provide customized benefit packages for demonstration e nrollees as long as the benefit package meets certain minimum standards described in this STC, and actuarial benefit equivalency requirements and benefit sufficiency requirements described in STCs 2 8 through 31, in accordance with section 409.973 F.S. For other plans, customized benefit packages must include all state plan services ot herwise available under the state plan for pregnant women and children including all EPSDT services for children under age 21. The customized benefit packages must include all mandatory services specified in the state plan for all populations. The amount, duration and scope of optional services, may vary to reflect the needs of the plan's target population as defined by the plan and approved by the Agency for Health Care Admini stration (AHCA). These plans can also offer additional services and benefits not available under the state plan. The plans contracted with the state shall not have service limits more restrictive than authorized in the state plan for children under the age of 21, pregnant women, and emergency services. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 20 of 95 Policies for determining medical necessity for children covered under the EPSDT benefit must be consistent with Fede ral statute at \u00a71905(r) of the Act in authorizing vision, dental, hearing services, and other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment and other measures described in \u00a71905(a) of the Act to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by screening services, whether or not such services are covered in the state plan. EPSDT provisions apply as well to the PDHPs. 28. Overall Standards for Customized Benefit Packages for MMA Plans. All benefit packages must be prior -approved by the state and CMS and must be at least actuarially equivalent to the services provided to the target population under the current state plan benef it package. In addition, the plan's customized benefit package must meet a sufficiency test to ensure that it is sufficient to meet the medical needs of the target population. Consistent with 42 CFR 438.3, customized benefit packages, as analyzed through the Plan Evaluation Tool (PET) discussed below, must be submitted to CMS for approval as part of the standard CMS contract review process. 29. Plan Evaluation Tool. The state will utilize a Plan Evaluation Tool (PET) to determine if a plan that is applying for, or has been awarded, an MMA plan contract meets state requirements. The PET measures actuarial equivalency and sufficiency. Specifically, the PET: (1) compares the value of the level of benefits (actuarial equivalency) in the proposed package to the value of the current state plan package for the average member of the population; and (2) ensures the sufficiency of benefits consistent with 42 CFR 438.210(a)(3) and STC 3 0. The state will evaluate service utilization on an annual basis and use this informati on to update the PET to ensure that actuarial equivalence calculations and sufficiency thresholds reflect current utilization levels. 30. Plan Evaluation Tool: Sufficiency. In addition to meeting the actuarial equivalence test, each health plan's proposed cus tomized benefit package must meet or exceed, and maintain, a minimum threshold of 98.5 percent. The sufficiency test provides a safeguard when plans elect to vary the amount , duration and scope of certain services. This standard is based on the target -population's historic use of the applicable Medicaid state plan services (e.g. outpatient hospital services, outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) identified by the state as sufficiency -tested benefits. Each proposed benefit plan must be evaluated against the sufficiency standard to ensure that the proposed benefits are adequate to meet the needs of 98.5 percent of enrollees. 31. Evaluation of Plan Benefits. The state will review and update the PET for assessing a plan's benefit structure to ensure actuarial equivalence and that services are sufficient to meet the needs of enrollees in the given service area. At a minimum, the state must conduct the review and update on an annual basis. The state will provide CMS with 60- days advance notice and a copy of any proposed changes to the PET. VIII. COST -SHARING Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 21 of 95 32. Premiums and Co -Payments. The state must pre -approve all cost sharing allowed by MMA or dental plans. Cost-sharing must be consistent with the state plan except that managed care plans may elect to assess cost -sharing that is less than what is allowed under the state plan. 33. American Indians. Indians who receive services directly by an Indian Health Care Provider (IHCP) or through refer ral under Purchased/Referred Care services shall not be imposed any enrollment fee, premium, or similar charge. No deduction, copayment, cost sharing or similar charges shall be imposed against any such Indian. Payments due to an IHCP or to a health care p rovider through referral under Purchased/Referred Care services for services provided to an eligible Indian shall not be reduced by the amount of any enrollment fee, premium, or similar charge, or any deduction, copayment, cost sharing or similar charges, that would be due from the Indian but for the prohibition on charging the Indian. IX. DELIV ERY SYSTEMS 34. Health Plans. The final contracts and, as applicable, capitation rates developed to implement selective contracting by the state with any MCO, provider group, Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan (PIHP) or Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP) shall be subject to CMS approval prior to implementation. The state may enter into contracts for Medicaid managed care plans with the following entities : a. Managed Care Or ganization (MCO) - An entity (such as Health Maintenance Organization, Accountable Care Organization, capitated Provider Service Network, or Exclusive Provider Organization) that meets the definition of MCO as described in 42 CFR 438.2, and which must conform to all of the requirements in 42 CFR 438 that apply to MCOs. b. Provider Service Network (PSN) - An entity established or organized by a health care provider or group of affiliated health care providers that meet the requirements of FS 409.912. A PSN may be reimbursed on a FFS or capitated basis as specified in state statute. Capitated PSNs are categorized as MCOs, and must meet the requirements as described in 42 CFR 438. c. Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan (PIHP), Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP) - Entities that meet the definition or PIHP or PAHP as described in 42 CFR 438.2 and which must conform to all requirements in 42 CFR 438 that apply to PIHPs and PAHPs. 35. Eligible Plan Selection. The state will procure a specified number of MMA plans per region in accordance with section 409.974, Florida Statutes. A minimum and maximum number of plans are specified by region, with a minimum of two plans choices in each region. Issuance and award of the procurements will provide for a choice of plans, as well as mar ket stability. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 22 of 95 Should the state not be able to contract with at least two MMA plans in a region that is not rural, the state will issue another procurement to obtain a second plan and meet the federal requirements in 42 CFR \u00a7438.52(a). Until two MMA plans are available in the impacted region, beneficiaries may voluntarily choose to enroll in the available MMA plan or to access services through a FFS delivery system. In addition to regional plans, the state will also seek to contract with specialty plans, as discussed in STC 37. Participation of specialty plans will be subject to competitive procurement requirements but will not be considered in assessing regional plan availability. Specialty plans are subject to 42 CFR 438.52 choice requirement. However, the state may not enter into contracts with additional specialty plans in a region if total enrollment in all specialty plans in the region is g reater than ten percent of demonstration enrollees in the region. The state will procure at least two statewide dental plans for the PDHP in accordance with section 409.973(5), Florida Statutes.

During transition to the PDHP, the state will auto -assign individuals into their existing dental plan that was subcontracted as a dental benefits manager for their current MMA plan. If an individual's existing plan is not a participating dental plan under the PDHP or if the recipient does not have an existing plan, the Agency will auto -assign based on the criteria specified in STC 2 4. Individuals may choose a different dental plan prior to enrollment and during the 120- day change/disenrollment -period without cause post-enrollment. 56. MEDS AD Program. The MEDS AD program provides coverage for certain aged and disabled individuals with incomes up to 88 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). Individuals enrolled in the program receive all services offered through the state plan as well as the community -based services provided in the programs identified below which are operated by the state under the authority of 1915(c) of the Act. a.

Recipients ages 21 years and older will continue to access all state plan services that are currently covered for adults and will be eligible to receive case management services through their health plan, medically necessary restorative massage, enteral fo rmulas, and incontinence supplies not otherwise available to adult recipients. These incontinence supplies will be in addition to what is offered under the Medicaid state plan according to the parameters at 42 CFR 440.70\u2014this includes a process whereby ind ividuals can request items that are not on the state's pre -approved list but are coverable under the benefit . b. Recipients under the age of 21 years will continue to have access to all state plan services and EPSDT benefits that are currently covered for children. 58. Healthy Start Program. The Healthy Start program is available statewide for eligible Medicaid recipients. The Healthy Start program is comprised of the following two components: a. MomCare : includes outreach and case management services for all women presumptively eligible and eligible for Medicaid under SOBRA. The MomCare component is a mandatory benefit for these women as long as they are eligible for Medicaid, and offers initial outreach to facilitate enrollment with a qualified prenatal care provider for early and continuous health care, Healthy Start prenatal risk screening and WIC services. Recipients may disenroll at any time. In addition, the MomCare component assists and facilitates the provision of any additional identified needs of the Medicaid recipient, including referral to community resources, family planning services, and Medicaid coverage for the infant and the need to select a primary care physician for the infant. b. Healthy Start Coordinated System of Care : includes outreach and case management services for eligible pregnant women and children identified as at risk through the Healthy Start program. These services are voluntary and are available for all Medicaid pregnant women and children up to the age of 3 who are identified to be at risk for a poor birth outcome, poor health and poor developmental outcomes. The services vary, dependent on need and may include: information, education and referral on identified risks, assessment, case coordination, childbirth education, parenting education, tobacco cessation, breastfeeding education, nutritional counseling and psychosocial counseling. The goal of this component is to increase the intensity and duration of service to Healthy Start beneficiaries. 59. Program for All Inclusive Care for Children (Children's Medical Services Network). Participation in the PACC program is voluntary. The PACC program provides the following pediatric palliative care support services to children enrolled in the CMS health, and prescribed drug services from an MMA plan; therefore, there will be no change in how these individuals receive MMA services, unless they choose to change plans. There will be no change for recipients who are not enrolled in a n MMA plan, and instead receive the aforementioned services through a Medicare Advantage Fully Liable D -SNP. This change will not affect how D -SNP enrollees receive their Medicare or Medicaid benefits Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 38 of 95 Network who have been diagnosed with potenti ally life -limiting conditions and referred by their primary care provider (PCP). a.

Bereavement and volunteer services are provided but are not reimbursable services. 60. Comprehensive Hemophilia Disease Management Program. The Medicaid Comprehensive Hemophilia Management program operates statew ide as a specialized service whereby recipients who have a diagnosis of hemophilia or von Willebrand disease and are enrolled in the FFS system or a MMA plan are required to obtain pharmaceutical services and products related to factor replacement therapy from one of the up to three contracted vendors. In addition to product distribution, the program provides pharmacy benefit management, direct beneficiary contact, personalized education, enhanced monitoring, and direct support of beneficiaries in the event of hospitalization, at no additional cost to the state. Enrollees have access to a registered nurse and licensed pharmacist 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The enrollees also have access to medical care and treatment through their usual and customary networks, with no restrictions on services or providers, and receive pharmacy products other than those related t o factor replacement therapy via the usual and customary networks without restriction, as well. The populations enrolled in the program have a diagnosis of hemophilia, are currently Medicaid eligible, receive prescribed drugs from the therapeutic MOF Factor IX, and Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 39 of 95 MOE - Antihemophilic Factors, Corifact (MOC therapeutic class), Stimate (P2B therapeutic class), and other therapeutic classes ident ified by the Agency as treatment for hemophilia or von Willebrand. Medicaid- Medicare eligible individuals may voluntarily enroll in the program. 61. Postpartum Extension. The state will extend postpartum coverage for individuals from the end of the state pla n 60-day postpartum period to the end of the 12th month following the end of the pregnancy. To be eligible for continuous extended postpartum coverage, individuals must be enrolled in any CHIP or Medicaid eligibility group while pregnant (including during a period of retroactive eligibility) . Individuals who are eligible for extended postpartum coverage will remain enrolled continuously regardless of changes in circumstances (except for changes in state residency, if the individual requests voluntary term ination or the individual is deceased) from pregnancy through the duration of the extended 12- month postpartum period. The state will conduct any required redetermination or renewal of eligibility at the end of the extended postpartum period consistent w ith 42 CFR 435.916 and 42 CFR 457.343. This includes determining Medicaid eligibility on all bases consistent with 42 CFR 435.916(f)(1) prior to determining an individual ineligible. Individuals determined eligible on another basis at the end of the postpa rtum period will be moved to the appropriate group at that time. Individuals determined ineligible for Medicaid on all bases will be provided advance notice of termination in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7435.917 and 42 C.F.R. Part 431, Subpart E and assessed for potential eligibility for other insurance affordability programs in accordance with 42 CFR 435.916(f)(2). Separate CHIP enrollees determined to be no longer eligible for CHIP must be screened for eligibility in other insurance affordability programs in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7457.350(b), and receive timely written notice of termination in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7457.340(e). a. Postpartum Coverage Monitoring and Evaluation . Monitoring reporting and evaluation for the postpartum extension component of the demonstration will be subject to the requirements that are also applicable for the overall demonstration monitoring and evaluation, as described in Section X VI on General Reporting Requirements and Section X X on Evaluation of the Demonstration of the STCs. The state will be required to amend its Evaluation Design to account for policy changes outlined in this amendment, including but not limited to evaluating the impact of extending the postpartum period from 60 days to 12 months. b. Implementation. The statut ory language of section s 9812 and 9822 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP), requires states who elect to extend 12 months of postpartum coverage to extend such coverage in both Medicaid and CHIP. The state's proposal to extend Medicaid coverage up to 12 months for postpartum individuals may not be implemented until the effective date of Senate Bill (SB) 2526, which provides t itle XXI funded individuals coverage for the duration of pregnancy and the postpartum period consisting of the 12- month per iod beginning on the last day of a pregnancy, as required in the ARP (Pub. L. 117- 2). To ensure Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 40 of 95 federal drawdown of allowable claims in accordance with statute, the state is required to submit a letter notifying CMS when SB 2526 has become effective, at which time the postpartum extension for both Medicaid and CHIP individuals may be implemented. While the legal provision of the ARP is in effect, the state is required to extend 12 months of postpartum coverage to pregnant individuals in both Medicaid and C HIP. If at any time, while the ARP is in effect, postpartum benefits are not extended to postpartum individuals in either CHIP or Medicaid, exactly as prescribed in statute, the postpartum expenditure authority authorized through these STCs will automatically terminate. c. Enrollment upon the Effective Date of the Postpartum Extension Period: Upon the effective date of this approval, individuals who are within 12 months postpartum, but who are outside of the state plan 60-day postpartum coverage period, may be enrolled or reenrolled in Medicaid or CHIP for the purpose of receiving extended postpartum coverage for the period of time that equates to the end of the 12th month following the end of the pregnancy. These individuals enrolled in the extended postpartum coverage period, not immediately following pregnancy but at a later point in time within the 12 -month coverage period, are only eligible for the period of time that remains prior to the end of the 12th month following the end of the pregnancy. For example, an eligible individual who is enrolled in the fourth month following pregnancy, will only be eligible to receive eight additional months of continuous postpartum coverage. XIV. LOW INCOME POOL 62. Low Income Pool Definition . The LIP provides government support for safety net providers for the costs of uncompensated charity care for low-income individuals who are uninsured. Uncompensated care (UC) includes charity care for the uninsured but does not include UC for insured individuals, \"bad debt,\" or Medicaid and CHIP shortfall. LIP payments are not associated with particular individuals and are not a form of health coverage or any other benefit inuring to individuals. The resulting total computable (TC) dollar limit is enumerated in STC 63(a). 63. Availability of Low Income Pool (LIP) Funds . The following STC presents the TC dollar limit for LIP spending , subject to the assurances that follow . a. Total LIP Amount. LIP Approval Periods TC Dollar Limit for LIP Expenditures in Each DY DY 12 - DY 16 $1,508,385,773 DY 17 - DY 21 $2,167,718,341 DY 22 - DY 24 TBD b. Assurance. As reflected in the LIP participation requirements in STC 70, the state and providers that are participating in LIP will provide assurance that LIP claims Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 41 of 95 include only costs associated with UC that is furnished through a charity care program and that adheres to the principles of the HFMA operated by the provider. c. Reassessment of Hospitals' Uncompensated Charity Care in DY17 . Low Income Pool limits for DY 17 -21 will be revised based on a reassessment of the amount of uncompensated charity care cost provided by Florida hospitals, to take place by March 31, 2022. The state and CMS will collaborate on the reassessment, which will be based on information reported by hospitals for federal fiscal year 2019 on schedule S -10 of the CMS 2552- 10 hospital cost report, with adjustment to ensure that LIP payments under this demonstration do not offset hospital costs in the calculation, following a methodology approved by CMS. The results of the reassessment will be used to revise the Total LIP Amount for DY 17 -21. i. If the reassessment discussed in in this STC is not completed to produce an updated LIP limit by July 1, 2022, all payments from the LIP will be unavailable until the reassessment is complete. ii. When the 2019 S -10 data specified above becomes available, the state and CMS will collaborate to recalculate the Total LIP Amount for DY 17-21 based on this updated information. The recalculated Total LIP Amount will become th e final Total LIP Amount for DY 17- 21. iii. The revised Total LIP Amount may not exceed $ 2,167,718,341 per DY , for the period covered by DY 17- 21.4 d. Reassessment of Hospitals' Uncompensated Charity Care in DY22 . Low Income Pool limits for DY 22 - DY 24 will be revised based on a reassessment of the amount of uncompensated charity care cost provided by Florida hospitals, to take place by M arch 31, 2027. The state and CMS will collaborate on the reassessment, which will be based on information reported by hospitals for periods beginning in federal fiscal year 2025 on schedule S -10 of the CMS 2552- 10 hospital cost report, with adjustment to ensure that LIP payments under this demonstration do not offset hospital costs in the calculation, following a methodol ogy approved by CMS. The results of the reassessment will be used to revise the Total LIP Amount for DY 22 - DY 24 . i. If the reassessment discussed in this STC is not completed to produce an updated LIP limit by July 1, 2027, all payments from the LIP will be unavailable until the reassessment is complete. ii. When 2025 S -10 data specified above becomes available, the state and CMS will collaborate to recalculate the Total LIP Amount for DY 22 - DY 24 based on this updated information. The recalculated Total LIP Amount will become the final Total LIP Amount for DY 22 - DY24. iii. The revised Total LIP Amount may not exceed $ 2,167,718,341 per DY for the period covered by DY 22 -24. 5 4 See Com prehensive Program Description a nd Objectives listed below in attachment A 5 See Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives listed below in attachment A Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 42 of 95 64. Capped Annual Allotments. All annual LIP funds must be expended by September 30 followi ng each authorized DY. Any amount not expended cannot be rolled over to the next DY. Capped annual allotment amounts that are not distributed because of penalties, recoupment due to payments exceeding UC cost, or are otherwise due to violating the terms of the approved STCs cannot be rolled over to another DY and are not recoverable. 65. LIP Reimbursement and Funding Methodology. The Reimbursement and Funding Methodology Document (RFMD) is prepared by the state for approval by CMS and documents LIP permissible expenditures, including the non -federal share and TC expenditures. The RFMD provides that TC LIP payments to providers for UC costs must be supported by UC costs incurred and reported by providers as charity care on the provider's financial records. Through the RFMD, the state must demonstrate that it has reconciled LIP payments to auditable costs. LIP provider payments for UC as charity care are limited to the uncompensated portion of providers' allowable costs and, in the aggregate, the authorized LIP pool amount for the DY. a. Prior to August 31 of each DY, the state must submit a draft of the RFMD for that DY to CMS for approval. The state may not claim FFP for LIP payments in that DY until after the RFMD for th at DY has been approved by CMS. b. For each DY, the state must reconcile LIP payments made to providers to ensure that they do not exceed allowed UC costs, using the CMS approved RFMD cost review protocol. The state must submit a LIP Cost Reconciliation report that has been examined and attested by an independent accountancy firm to CMS within four years after the end of each DY showing cost reconciliation results by provider as required under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.304. CMS will review the state's reconciliation and share any findings with the state. To the extent that payments are found to exceed allowed UC costs, the federal portion of any excess payment must be returned to CMS by submitting a decreasing expenditure adjustment (on Form CMS -64, Line 10B). If the stat e has not submitted its LIP Cost Reconciliation Report for a DY within the timeframe described above, CMS may issue a deferral or disallowance for an amount not to exceed the total of the state's submitted LIP expenditures for the DY for which the LIP Cost Reconciliation Report is overdue. c. A provider may at any time during a DY , disclose to the state that LIP payments to that provider exceeded allowed UC costs. If a provider refunds an overpayment to the state, the state must report that refund by including a decreasing expenditure adjustment on Line 10B of the CMS -64 for the quarter that it was received. If the provider reports an overpayment and does not refund that overpayment, the state has one year from the date of discovery, to have the provider refund the overpayment on the CMS -64. If the provider does not refund that overpayment within one year from the date of discovery, the state must refund the overpayment on the CMS -64. Any overpayments that have not been refunded to CMS may be subject to interest as defined under 42 CFR 433.320(a)(4). Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 43 of 95 d. A provider is not eligible for an LIP payment or continued LIP payments if (i) the provider is identified in a disallowance notice from CMS to the State as having received an LIP overpayment in a specified amount i n a prior year; and (ii) the provider has not entered into a repayment agreement satisfactory to the State within 30 days after the date by which the State must credit CMS with the federal share of the specified overpayment, or (iii) the provider is in bre ach of a repayment agreement. e. A provider that is ineligible for LIP payments on the basis of the above may re - establish eligibility by making repayment arrangements satisfactory to the state . Payments from LIP to hospitals are to be considered Medicaid hospital revenue for the purpose of determining the hospital -specific disproportionate share hospital (DSH) limits defined in section 1923(g) of the Act. f. For the purposes of this STC, allowed UC cost follows the definitions described in STC 66 below. 66. Low Income Pool Permissible Expenditures . Funds from the LIP may be used to defray the actual uncompensated cost of furnishing medical services described in section 1905(a)(1) et seq. of the Act to uninsured individuals incurred by qualifying providers . a. These health care costs may be incurred by the state or by providers to furnish uncompensated medical care as charity care for low -income individuals who are uninsured. The costs must be incurred pursuant t o a charity care program that adheres to the principles of the HFMA. i. Providers may be categorized in up to four groups: hospitals, Medical School Physician Practices, FQHCs/RHCs, and Community Behavioral Health Providers. Each group may be divided into up to five tiered subgroups, any of which may be based on ownership, UC Ratio, or ownership and UC Ratio, or (for purposes of FQHCs/RHCs only) Section 330 Public Health Service Act grant type, or FQHC Look- Alike status . UC Ratio is defined as the amount of a provider's uncompensat ed uninsured charity care costs (defined in (a) above), expressed as a percentage of its privately insured patient care costs. UC Ratio for FQHCs/RHCs is defined as the amount of a provider's uncompensated uninsured charity care costs (defined in (a) above), expressed as a percentage of its total costs. To define subgroups by UC Ratio, providers must be ranked based on their relative UC Ratios, and may be formed into subgroups based on contiguous ranges of UC Ratios. Hospital ownership subgroups may consis t of one or more of the following categories: local government, state government, or private and may be grouped by the hospital's publicly owned, statutory teaching, freestanding children's, and Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Center hospital status. For each DY, up to $75,000,000 of the capped annual allotment of the LIP may be apportioned to FQHCs/RHCs. FQHCs/RHCs may be tiered in subgroups by the type of Section 330 Public Health Service Act grant type and Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 44 of 95 FQHC Look -Alike status. ii. All providers that m ust receive some amount of payment (following (1) above) must be paid the same percentage of their charity care cost within each subgroup. iii. Within each group and ownership subgroup, providers in tiers with a lower range of UC Ratios cannot be paid a greater share of their charity care cost than providers in tiers with higher UC Ratios. iv. Determination of (1) through (3) may be effectuated using hospital -specific cost data for the DY for which payments are being allocated, or for a prior year not more than three years prior to that DY. 67. Low Income Pool Permissible Hospital Expenditures. Hospital cost expenditures from the LIP will be paid up to cost and are further defined in the RFMD utilizing methodologies from the CMS -2552 cost report plus mutually agreed upon additional costs that will be defined in the RFMD. The state shall not receive FFP for Medicaid and LIP payments to hospitals in excess of cost. 68. Low Income Pool Permissible Non -Hospital -Based Expendi tures. To ensure services are paid up to or at cost, the RFMD defines the cost reporting strategies required to support non- hospital based LIP expenditures. 69. Permissible Sources of Funding Criteria. Sources of non- federal funding must be compliant with se ction 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. Federal funds received from other federal programs (unless expressly authorized by federal statute to be used for matching purposes) shall be impermissible as sources of non- federal funding. XV.

CMS may agree to a corrective action as an interim step before applying the deferral, if corrective action is proposed in the state's written extension request. c. If CMS agrees to an interim corrective process in accordance with subsection (b), and the state fails to comply with the corrective action steps or still fails to submit the overdue deliverable(s) that meets the terms of this agreement, CMS may proceed with the issuance of a deferral against the next Quarterly Statement of Expenditures reported in Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System/State Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES) followin g a written deferral notification to the state. d. If the CMS deferral process has been initiated for state non -compliance with the terms of this agreement for submitting deliverable(s), and the state submits the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 48 of 95 overdue deliverable(s), and such deliverable( s) are accepted by CMS as meeting the standards outlined in these STCs, the deferral(s) will be released. As the purpose of a section 1115 demonstration is to test new methods of operation or service delivery, a state's failure to submit all required monitoring reports, evaluations and other deliverables will be considered by CMS in reviewing any application for an extension, amendment, or for a new demonstration. 73. Submission of Post -Approval Deliverables. The state must submit all deliverables as stipulated by CMS and within the timeframes outlined within these STCs . 74. Compliance with Federal Systems Updates . As federal systems continue to evolve and incorporate additional 1115 waiver reporting and analytics functions, the state will work with CMS to: 1. Revise the reporting templates and submission processes to accommodate timely compliance with the requirements of the new systems; 2. Ensure all 1115, Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T -MSIS), and other data elements that have been agreed to for reporting and analytics are provided by the state; and 3. Submit deliverables to the appropriate system as directed by CMS. 75. Monitoring Protocol. The state must submit to CMS a draft Monitoring Protocol no later than one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days after the start date of the demonstration approval period. The state must submit a revised Monitoring Protocol within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of CMS' s comments. Once approved, the Monitoring Protocol will be incorporated into the STCs as Attachment D. At a minimum, the Monitoring Protocol will affirm the state's commitment to conduct quarterly and annual monitoring in accordance with CMS's templates. Any proposed deviations from CMS's templates should be documented in the Monitoring Protocol. The Monitoring Protocol will describe the quantitative and qualitative elements on which the state will report through quarterly and annual monitoring reports. For quantitative metrics , CMS will provide the state with a set of required metrics and technical specifications for data collection and analysis covering reporting topics such as enrollment, access to care, quality of care and health outcomes. In addition, CMS will provide the state with metrics related to the key policies being tested under this demonstration, including but not limited to, incentives for healthy behaviors (e.g., utilization of programs outlined in STC 53 and 53a), and the waiver of retroactive eligibility . The Monitoring Protocol will specify the methods of data collection and timeframes for reporting on the state's progress as part of the quarterly and annual monitoring reports. Fo r the qualitative elements (e.g., operational updates), CMS will provide the state with guidance on narrative and descriptive information which will supplement the quantitative metrics on key aspects of the demonstration policies. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 49 of 95 The quantitative and qua litative elements will comprise the state's quarterly and annual monitoring reports. 76. Monitoring Reports. The state must submit three (3) Quarterly Monitoring Reports and one (1) Annual Monitoring Report each DY. The fourth quarter information that would ordinarily be provided in a separate monitoring report should be reported as distinct information within the Annual Monitoring Report. The Quarterly Monitoring Reports are due no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the end of each demonstration quarter. The Annual Monitoring Report (including the fourth-quarter information) is due no later than ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the DY. The monitoring reports will include all required elements as per 42 CFR 431.428, and should not direct readers to links outside the monitoring report. Additional links not referenced in the document may be listed in a Reference/Bibliography section. The monitoring r eports must follow the framework provided by CMS, which is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolved, and be provided in a structured manner that supports federal tracking and analysis. a. Operational Updates - The operational updates will focus on progress toward meeting the demonstration's milestones. Additionally, per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any policy or administrative difficulties in operating the demonstration. The Monitoring Reports shall provide sufficient information to document key operational and other challenges, underlying causes of challenges, how challenges are being addressed, as well as key achievements and to what conditions and efforts successes can be attributed. The discussion should also include any issues or complaints identified by beneficiaries; lawsu its or legal actions; unusual or unanticipated trends; legislative updates; and descriptions of any public forums held. The Monitoring Reports should also include a summary of all public comments received through post-award public forums regarding the pro gress of the demonstration. b. Performance Metrics - The performance metrics will provide data to demonstrate how the state is progressing towards meeting the demonstration's annual goals and overall targets, where applicable . As will be identified in the approved Monitoring Protocol, Monitoring Reports will cover key policies under this demonstration, including but not limited to incentives for healthy behaviors (e.g., utilization of programs outlined in STC 53 and 53a) and waiv ers of retroactive eligibility. The performance metrics will also reflect all other components of the state's demonstration. For example, these metrics will cover enrollment, completion of incentivized healthy behaviors and rewards granted, unpaid medical bills at application (if available), access to care, and quality of care and health outcomes. The state will also be required to report certain metrics related to postpartum coverage. Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the impact of the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 50 of 95 demonstration in providing insurance coverage to beneficiaries and the uninsured population, as well as outcomes of care, quality and cost of care, and access to care. This may also include the results of beneficiary satisfaction surveys, if conducted, and grievances and appeals. The required monitoring and performance metrics must be included in writing in the Monitoring Reports, and will follow the framework provided by CMS to support federal tracking and analysis. c. Budget Neutrality and Financial Reporting Requirements - Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the financial performance of the demonstration. The state must provide an updated budget neutrality workbook with every Monitoring Report that meets all the reporting requi rements for monitoring budget neutrality set forth in the General Financial Requirements section of these STCs, including the submission of corrected budget neutrality data upon request. In addition, the state must report quarterly and annual expenditures associated with the populations affected by this demonstration on the Form CMS-64. Administrative costs for this demonstration should be reported separately on the CMS -64. d. Evaluation Activities and Interim Findings -Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any results of the demonstration to date per the evaluation hypotheses. The state shall include a summary of the progress of evaluation activities, including key milestones accomplished, as well as c hallenges encountered and how they were addressed. 77. Corrective Action Plan Related to Monitoring. If monitoring indicates that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. A state corrective action plan could include a temporary suspension of implementation of demonstration programs, in circumstances where monitoring indicates indicate substantial and sustained directional change inconsistent with state targets (such as substantial and sustained trends indicating increased difficulty accessing services). A corrective action plan may be an interim step to withdrawing waivers or expenditure authorities, as outlined in STC 9. CMS will withdraw an authority, as described in STC 9, when metrics indicate substantial, sustained directional change, inconsistent with state targets, and the state has not implemented corrective action. CMS would further have the ability to suspend implementation of the demonstration should corrective actions not effectively resolve these concerns in a timely manner. 78. Close out Report . Within 120 calendar days after the expiration of the demonstration, the state must submit a draft Close Ou t Report to CMS for comments. a. The draft report must comply with the most current guidance from CMS. b. The state will present to and participate in a discussion with CMS on the Close Out report. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 51 of 95 c. The state must take into consideration CMS' s comments for incorporation into the final Close Out Report. d. A revised Close Out Report is due to CMS no later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of CMS' s comments. e. A delay in submitting the draft or final version of the Close Out Report may subject the state to penalties described in STC 72. 79. Monitoring Calls. CMS will convene periodic conference calls with the state. a. The purpose of these calls is to discuss ongoing demonstration operation, to include (but not limited to), any significant actual or anticipated developments affecting the demonstration. Examples include implementation activities, trends in reported data on metrics and associated mid -course adjustments, budget neutrality, and progress on evaluation activities. b. CMS will provide updates on any pending actions, as well as federal policies and issues that may affect any aspect of the demonstration. c. The state and CMS will jointly develop the agenda for the calls. 80. Post Award Forum. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), within six (6) months of the demonstration's implementation, and annually thereafter, the state shall afford the public with an opportunity to provide meaningful comment on the progress of the demonstration. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the planned public forum, the state must publish the date, time and location of the forum in a prominent location on its website. The state must also post the most recent A nnual M onitoring R eport on its website with the public forum announcement. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), the state must include a summary of the comments in in the Monitoring Report associated with the quarter in which the forum was held, as well as in its compiled Annual Monitoring Report . XVII . GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 81. Allowable Expenditures. This demonstration project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demonstration approval period designated by CMS. CMS will provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures only so long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits as specified in these STCs. 8 82. Medicaid Expenditure Groups (MEG). MEGs are defined for the purpose of identifying categories of Medicaid or demonstration expenditures subject to budget neutrality, components of budget neutrality expenditure limit calculations, and other purposes related to monitoring and tracking expenditures under the demonstration. The Master MEG Chart table (Table 2) provides a master list of MEGs defined for this demonstration. Table 2: Master MEG Chart 8 For a description of CMS 's current policies related to budget neutrality for Medicaid demonstration pro jects authorized under section 1115(a) of the Act , see State Medicaid Director Letter #18 -009. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 52 of 95 MEG To Which BN Test Does This Apply?

Reporting Expenditures and Member Months. The state must report all demonstration expenditures claimed under the authority of title XIX of the Act and subject to budget neutrality each quarter on separate f orms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS, (11-W-00206/4). Separate reports must be submitted by MEG (identified by Waiver Name) and Demonstration Year (identified by the two digit project number extension). Unless specified otherwise, expenditures must be reported by DY according to the dates of service associated with the expenditure. All MEGs identifi ed in the Master MEG Chart as WW must be reported for expenditures, as further detailed in the MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Month Reporting table below. To enable calculation of the budget neutrality expenditure limits, the state also must report member months of eligibility for specified MEGs. The state will work with CMS to develop a method of reporting spending on dental care through the health Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 53 of 95 plans. a. Cost Settlements. The state will report any cost settlements attributable to the demonstration on the appropriate prior period adjustment schedules (form CMS- 64.9P WAIVER) for the summary sheet line 10b, in lieu of lines 9 or 10c. For any cost settlement not attributable to this demonstration, the adjustments should be reported as otherwise instruc ted in the State Medicaid Manual. Cost settlements must be reported by DY consistent with how the original expenditures were reported. b. Premiums and Cost Sharing Collected by the State. The state will report any premium contributions collected by the state from demonstration enrollees quarterly on the form CMS-64 Summary Sheet line 9D, columns A and B. In order to assure that these collections are properly credited to the demonstration, quarterly premium collections (both total computable and federal share) should also be reported separately by DY on form CMS -64 Narrative, and on the Total Adjustments tab in the Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool. In the annual calculation of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit, premiums collected in the demonstration year will be offset against expenditures incurred in the demonstration year for determination of the state's compliance with the budget neutrality limits. c. Pharmacy Rebates. Because pharmacy rebates are included in the base expenditures used to determine the budget neutrality expenditure limit, the state must report the portion of pharmacy rebates applicable to the demonstration on the appropriate forms CMS -64.9 WAIVER and 64.9P waiver for the demonstration, and not on any other CMS-64.9 form (to avoid double counting). The state must have a methodology for assigning a portion of pharmacy rebates to the demonstration in a way that reasonably reflects the actual rebate -eligible pharmacy utilization of the demonstration population, and which identifies pharmacy rebate amounts with DYs. Use of the methodology is subject to the approval in advance by CMS, and changes to the methodology must also be approved in advance by CMS. Each rebate amount must be distributed as state and federal revenu e consistent with the federal matching rates under which the claim was paid. d. Administrative Costs. The state will separately track and report additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration. All administrative costs mu st be identified on the forms CMS-64.10 WAIVER and/or 64.10P WAIVER, using with the waiver name \"ADM\". Unless indicated otherwise on the Master MEG Chart table, administrative costs are not counted in the budget neutrality tests; however, these costs are s ubject to monitoring by CMS. e. Member Months. As part of the Quarterly and Annual Monitoring Reports described in section XX, the state must report the actual number of \"eligible member months\" for all demonstration enrollees for all MEGs identified as WOW Per Capita in the Master MEG Chart table above, and as also indicated in the MEG Detail for Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 54 of 95 Expenditure and Member Month Reporting table below. The term \"eligible member months\" refers to the number of months in which persons enrolled in the demonstration are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for three months contributes three eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for two months, each contribute two eligible member months, for a total of fou r eligible member months. The state must submit a statement accompanying the annual report certifying the accuracy of this information. f. Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual. The state will create and maintain a Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual that describes in detail how the state will compile data on actual expenditures related to budget neutrality, including methods used to extract and compile data from the state's Medicaid Management Information System, eligibility system, and accounting systems for reporting on the CMS-64, consistent with the terms of the demonstration. The Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual will also describe how the state compiles counts of Medicaid member months. The Budget Neutrality Specifications Manual must be made available to CMS on request. g. Excluded Services. The following services are excluded from the demonstration, in that they are excluded from the list of benefits for which MMA managed care plans will provide coverage. Expenditures for these services are not expenditures subject to the BN limit, so should not be reported on any Forms CMS-64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver for this demonstration. i. Home and Community Based Service Waiver Services (Model Waiver (formerly Katie Beckett Model Waiver Services), Fam ilial Dysautonomia, Development Disabilities Individual Budgeting); ii. Long Term Care Waiver; iii. ICF/IID Institutional Services; iv. School Based Administrative Claiming; v. Prescribed pediatric extended care (PPEC) services; vi. County matching programs (Substance Abuse and Medicaid Certified School Match Services); vii. State Mental Health Hospital services for recipients age 65 and older; viii. Certain physician -injectable procedures; and ix. Vaccines for Children program for MediKids. h. Sanctions and Liquidated Damages. If the state i mposes monetary sanctions or liquidated damages against an MCO, the state must report the monetary amounts on the CMS -64 Summary Line 9D in the quarter in which the plan has exhausted all administrative appeals or the time to seek an administrative appeal has expired. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 55 of 95 i. Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Limits. The following types of expenditures are subject to the BN limits for this demonstration. i. All medical assistance expenditures for Medicaid beneficiaries in the categories listed in S TC 2 1(a), (b), or (c) (regardless of their managed care enrollment status), other than expenditures for services listed in STC 83(e), ii. All expenditures made under section 1115(a)(2) expenditure authority, including all payments made under LIP, through June 30, 2030. j. Achieved Saving Rebates and Managed Care Plans. If the state requires the m anaged care plans to return any monies back to the state for any programs that are setup by the state including the Achieved Saving Rebates program, the state must report the monetary amounts on the CMS- 64 Summary Line 9D in the quarter that the state receives these monies. 9 Table 3: MEG Detail for Expenditure and Member Month Reporting MEG (Waiver Name) Detailed Description Exclusions CMS -64.9 Line(s) To Use How Expend.

Demonstration Years. Demonstration Years (DY) for this demonstration are defined in the Demonstration Years table below. Table 4: Demonstration Years Demonstration Year 15 July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 12 months Demonstration Year 16 July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 12 months Demonstration Year 17 July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 12 months Demonstration Year 18 July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024 12 months Demonstration Year 19 July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025 12 months Demonstration Year 20 July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 12 months Demonstration Year 21 July 1, 2026 to June 30, 2027 12 months Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 59 of 95 Demonstration Year 22 July 1, 2027 to June 30, 2028 12 months Demonstration Year 23 July 1, 2028 to June 30, 2029 12 months Demonstration Year 24 July 1, 2029 to June 30, 2030 12 months 85. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process will be used for this demonstration. The state will provide quarterly expenditure reports through the Medicaid and CHIP Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES) to report total expenditures for services provided under this demonstration following routine CMS -37 and CMS -64 reporting instructions as outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual. The state will estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and federal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each federal fiscal year on the form CMS -37 for both the medical assistance payments (MAP) and state and local administration costs (ADM). CMS shall make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, the state shall submit form CMS -64 Quarterly Medicaid Expenditure Report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. If applicable, subject to the payment deferral process, CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on form CMS -64 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 86. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration . Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non- federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable federal matching rates for the following, subject to the limits described in Section XVIII: a. Administrative costs , including those associated with the administration of the demonstration; b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid state plan ; c. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments, made under 1115 demonstration authority , with dates of service during the operation of the demonstration including those made in conjunction with the demonst ration, net of enrollment fees, cost sharing, pharmacy rebates, and all other types of third party liability ; d. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments for MMA Plan premiums paid to managed care entities and fee for service coverage carve- out services and for voluntary MMA populations that choose to stay in FFS; e. Net Expenditures associated with the LIP, as described in Section XIV; and, Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 60 of 95 f. Pursuant to standard Medicaid financing rules, FFP is excluded for payments with respect to care or services for any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution) pursuant to the payment exclusion in paragraph (A) following section 1905(a)(29) of the Act. g. In addition, pursuant to standard Medicaid financing rules, FFP is excluded for payments with respect to care or services for any individual who has not attained 65 year of age and who is a patient in an institution for mental diseases pursuant to the payment exclusion in paragraph (B) following section 1905(a)(29) of the Act, except as provided in section 1905(a)(16) for inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21. 87. Sources of Non -Federal Share. As a condition of demonstration approval, the state certifies that he non -federal share is obtained from permissible state and/or local funds that, unless permitted by law, are not other federal funds . The state further certifies that such funds must not be used as the match for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. CMS approval of this demonstration does not constitute direct or indirect approval of any underlying source of non -federal share or associated funding mechanisms and all sources of non- Federal funding must be compliant with Section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, CMS reserves the right to prohibit the use of any sources of non -federal share funding that it determines impermissible. a. If requested, the state must submit for CMS review and approval documentation of any sources of non- federal share that would be used to fund the demonstration. b. If requested, the state must submit for CMS review and approval documentation of any sources of non- federal share that would be used to fund the demonstration. c. Without limitation, CMS may request informa tion about the non- federal share sources for any amendments that CMS determines may financially impact the demonstration. 88. Claiming Period. The state will report all claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) within two years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. All claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two- year period, the state will continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 w aiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 89. Future Adjustments to Budget Neutrality . CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality expenditure limit: Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 61 of 95 a. To be consistent with enforcement of laws and policy statements, including regulations and letters, regarding impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, or other payments, CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the budget neutrality limit if any health care related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider -related donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health care related tax provisions of secti on 1903(w) of the Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. b. To the extent that a change in federal law, regulation, or policy requires either a reductio n or an increase in FFP for expenditures made under this demonstration. In this circumstance, the state must adopt, subject to CMS approval, a modified budget neutrality agreement as necessary to comply with such change. The modified agreement will be eff ective upon the implementation of the change. The trend rates for the budget neutrality agreement are not subject to change under this STC. The state agrees that if mandated changes in the federal law require state legislation, the changes shall take effect on the day such state legislation becomes effective, or on the last day such legislation was required to be in effect under the federal law. c. The state certifies that the data it provided to establish the budget neutrality expenditure limit are accurate based on the state's accounting of recorded historical expenditures or the next best available data, that the data are allowable in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and policies, and that the data are correct to the best of the state's knowledge and belief. The data supplied by the state to set the budget neutrality expenditure limit are subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. 90. Budg et Neutrality Monitoring Tool . The state must provide CMS with quarterly budget neutrality status updates, including established baseline and member months data, using the Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool provided through the Performance Metrics Database and Analytics (PMDA) system. The tool incorporates the \"Schedule C Report\" for comparing demonstration's actual expenditures to the budget neutrality expenditure limits described in section XI. CMS will provide technical assistance, upon request. 10 10 42 CFR \u00a7431.420(a)(2) provides that states must comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement between the Secretary (or designee) and the state to implement a demonstration project, and \u00a7431.420(b)(1) states that the terms and conditions will provide that the state will perform periodic reviews of the implementation of the demonstration. CMS's current approach is to include language in STCs requiring, as a condition of demonstration approval, that states provide, as part of their periodic reviews, regular reports of the actual costs which are subject to the budget neutrality limit. CMS has obtained Office of Management and Budget (OM B) approval of the monitoring tool under the Paperwork Reduction Act (OMB Control No. 0938 - 1148) and in states agree to use the tool as a condition of demonstration approval. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 62 of 95 91. Claimin g Period. The state will report all claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) within two years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. All claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two- year period, the state will continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dat es of service during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 92. Financial Integrity for Managed Care and Other Delivery Systems. As a condition of demonstration approval, the state attests to the following, as applicable: a. All risk -based managed care organization, prepaid inpatient health plan (PIHP), and prepaid ambulatory health plan (PAHP) payments, comply with the requirements on payments in 42 CFR \u00a7438.6(b)(2), and PAHPs, arrangements comply with the upper payment limits specified in 42 CFR \u00a7447.362, and if payments exceed the cost of services, the state will recoup the excess an d return the federal share of the excess to CMS. 93. Program Integrity. The state must have processes in place to ensure that there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration. The state must also ensure that the state and any of its contractors follow standard program integrity principles and practices including retention of data. All data, financial reporting, and sources of non- federal share are subject to audit . XVIII. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY The following describes the method by which BN will be assured under the demonstration. The demonstration will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the demonstration period. STCs 87- 88 specify the two independent financial caps on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on expenditures subject to the BN limit as defined in STC 95. Federal financial payments for the MMA aspects of the demonstration are limited by a Per Member Per Month (PMPM) method cap and the payments for the LIP aspects are limited by an aggregate cap. 94. Budget Neutrality Limit for the LIP (Hypo 1) . The maximum allowable LIP amount is capped annually at $1,508,385,773 (TC) for DY 1 2 through DY 16 and $2,167,718,341 (TC) for DY 17 through DY 21. LIP funds not distributed in a DY cannot be rolled over to the next. The federal share of the TC LIP amount is the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive for the LIP permissible expenditures detailed in STC 66. For each DY, the federal share will be calculated using the FMAP rate(s) applicable to that year. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 63 of 95 95. Limit on PMPM Title XIX Funding . The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on the Medicaid and demonstration expenditures identified in STC 86 during the approval period of the demonstration. The limit is determined using a PMPM method. The BN targets are set on a yearly basis with a cumulative BN limit for the length of the entire demonstration (see STC 98) . All data supplied by the state to CMS is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified BN limit. CMS' assessment of the state's compliance with these limits will be done using the CMS -64 Report from the MBES/CBES System. 96. Risk . The budget neutrality expenditure limits are determined on either a per capita or aggregate basis. If a per capita method is used, the state is at risk for the per capita cost of state plan and hypothetical populations, but not for the number of participants in the demonstration population. By providing FFP without regard to enrollment in the demonstratio n for all demonstration populations, CMS will not place the state at risk for changing economic conditions; however, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs of the demonstration populations, CMS assures that the demonstration expenditures do not exceed the levels that would have been realized had there been no demonstration. If an aggregate method is used, the state accepts risk for both enrollment and per capita costs. 97. Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio that will be used to convert the total computable budget neutrality limit to federal share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the approval period by total computable demonstration expenditures for the same period, as reported through MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedule C. Since the actual final Composite Federal Share will not be known until the end of the demonstration's approval period, for the purpose of interim monitoring of budget neutrality, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or through an alternative mutually agreed to method. E ach Hypothetical Budget Neutrality Test has its own Composite Federal Share, as defined in the paragraph pertaining to each particular test. 98. Main Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit Test . The following describes the method for calculating the BN expenditu re limit for the demonstration. Demonstration expenditures shall be reported under the Medicaid Eligibility Groups (MEG) listed in STC 82. For the purpose of calculating the overall PMPM expenditure limit for the demonstration, separate budget estimates w ill be calculated for each year on a DY basis. The annual estimates will then be summed to obtain an expenditure estimate through DY 16. The federal share of this estimate will represent the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive for the types of Medicaid expenditures described in this section. Budget neutrality calculations for both \"With Waiver\" (WW) and \"Without Waiver\" (WOW) expenditures are applied on a statewide basis. The federal share of the BN limit will be the total computable BN limit times Composite Federal Share #1 Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 64 of 95 (described below). For the purpose of monitoring BN, the annual LIP expenditures enumerated in STC 65(a) shall be considered as both WW and WOW expenditures (i.e. pass through costs). In response to the Public Health Emergency, CMS will allow for a one -time adjustment to budget neutrality to account for impacts of COVID -19 on enrollment and expenditures a. Projecting Service Expenditures - Each yearly estimate of MMA service expenditures will be the cost projections for the MEGs in sub-STC (b) below. The annual budget estimate for each MEG will be the product of the projected PMPM cost for the MEG, times the actual number of eligible member months as reported to CMS by the state under the guidelines set forth in STC 83. Specifically, 1. \"Aged/Disabled\" MEG PMPM is multiplied by MEG 1 member months 2. \"TANF & Rel Grp\" MEG PMPM is multiplied by MEG 2 member months b. Projected PMPM Cost - The PMPM costs for each MEG used to calculate the annual BN expenditure limit for this demonstration is specified below in Table 2. Table 2. PMPM Costs by MEG and Demonstration Year Aged/Disabled MEG 1 Trend Rate TANF the Limit will be Applied. The limits as defined in STCs 98-100 will apply to the actual expenditures for the demonstration, as reported by the state under Sec tion 95, and specifically, to expenditures reported for the following MEGs: Aged/Disabled, TANF & related grp, CNOM, and PACC CNOM . If at the end of the demonstration period the BN provision has been exceeded, the excess federal funds will be returned to CMS. There will be no new limit placed on the FFP that the state can claim for expenditures for recipients and program categories n ot listed. 100. Hypotheticals & Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 2: MEDS -AD. Optional Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 65 of 95 demonstration expenditures that could have been covered via the Medicaid state plan, but instead are provided through section 1115(a) expenditure authority, may be designated as \"hypotheticals\" for the purposes of BN. In these cases, CMS may allow adjustment(s) to the WOW baseline to hold states harmless for the spending which it could have hypothetically provided through the Medicaid state plan. Separate WOW limits are provided below for the costs associated with this demonstration's hypothetical expenditures and, if the limits are exceeded, that excess spending must be \"paid for\" with overall BN savings. a. The MEDS AD MEG listed in Table 3 below is included in the ME DS- AD Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test. Table 3 .1. PMPMs for Supplemental BN expenditures cap for the supplemental BN test is calculated by multiplying the projected PMPM for the MEDS AD MEG, each DY, by the number of actual eligible MEDS AD member months for the same/corresponding MEG/DY \u2014and summing the products together across all DYs. The federal share of the MEDS AD expendit ure cap is obtained by multiplying this cap by the Composite Federal Share #2 described in STC 106 below. c. If the actual FFP claimed by the state for the MEDS AD MEG for all DYs is greater than the federal share of the MEDS AD expenditure cap defined in sub- STC (b) above, then that overage will be subtracted from the demonstration's overall BN variance. 101. Hypotheticals & Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test: Behavioral Health and Supportive Housing Assistance Pilot. Optional demonstration expenditures that could have been covered via the Medicaid state plan, but instead are provided through section 1115(a) expenditure authority, may be designated as \"hypotheticals\" for the purposes of BN. In these cases, CMS may allow adjustment(s) to the WOW baseline to hol d states harmless for the spending which it could have hypothetically provided through the Medicaid state plan. Separate WOW limits are provided below for the costs associated with this demonstration's hypothetical expenditures and, if the limits are excee ded, that excess spending must be \"paid for\" with overall BN savings. a. The BH SH Pilot MEG listed in Table 3 .2 below is included in the Behavioral Health and Supportive Housing Assistance Pilot Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 66 of 95 Table 3. 2. Total Spending for Supplemental BN Test -BH SH Pilot The projected BH SH Pilot for each DY is the amount shown in Table 3.2. The BH SH Pilot expenditures cap is the sum of the annual DY -specific amounts for all DY. The federal share of the BH SH Pilot expenditure cap is obtained by multiplying this cap by the Composite Federal Share #3 described in STC 106 below. c. If the actual FFP claimed by the state for the BH SH Pilot MEG for all DYs is greater than the federal share of the BH SH Pilot expenditure cap defined in sub-STC (b) above, then that overage will be subtracted from the demonstration's overall BN variance. 102. Hypotheticals & Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test: Postpartum Extension. Optional demonstration expenditures that could have been covered via the Medicaid state plan, but instead are provided through section 1115(a) expenditure authority, may be designated as \"hypotheticals\" for the purposes of BN. In these cases, CMS may allow adjustment(s) to the WOW baseline to hold states harmless for the spending which it could have hypothetically provided through the Medicaid state plan. Separate WOW limits are provided below for the costs associated with this demonstration's hypothetical expenditures and, if the limits are exceeded, that excess spending must be \"paid for\" wit h overall BN savings. a. The Postpartum Extension MEG listed in Table 3. 3 below is included in the Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test. Table 3. 3. PMPMs for Supplemental BN Test cap for the supplemental BN test is calculated by multiplying the projected PMPM for the postpartum MEG, each DY, by Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 67 of 95 the number of actual eligible postpartum member months for the same/corresponding MEG/DY \u2014and summing the products together across all DYs. The federal share of the postpartum expenditure cap is obtained by multiplying this cap by the Composite Federal Share #2 described in STC 10 6 below. c. If the actual FFP claimed by the state for the postpartum MEG for all DYs is greater than the federal share of the postpartum expenditure cap defined in sub- STC (b) above, then that overage will be subtracted from the demonstration's overall BN variance. 103. Savings Phase -Out. Each DY, the net variance between the WOW cost and actual WW cost will be reduced for selected population- based MEGs. The reduced variance, to be calculated as a percentage of the total variance, will supersede the total variance in determining overall BN for the demonstration. (Equivalently, the difference between the total variance and reduced variance could be subtracted f rom the WOW cost estimate.) The formula for calculating the reduced variance is: reduced variance equals total variance multiplied by the applicable percentage. The applicable percentages for each MEG and DY are determined based upon length of time the ass ociated population has been enrolled in managed care; lower percentages are associated with longer established managed care populations. The MEGs affected by this provision and the applicable percentages are shown in Table 4 below, except that if the total variance for a MEG in a DY is negative, the applicable percentage is 100 percent. Table 4. Savings Phase -Out Percentages DY 15 DY 16 MEG 1 and MEG 2 49% 44% 104. Rebasing. On July 1, 2022, the budget neutrality limits for this demonstration will be rebased consistent with the requirements that are outlined in State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL ) #18-009 and other CMS guidance. To establish the new PMPMs, the state agrees to utilize its most recent 5 years of complete and contiguous historical expenditure data which was reported in MBES through June 30, 2021. In addition, CMS will recalculate the LIP's UC limits as part of the rebasing process. The rebasing process es descri bed in this STC must be re calculated every 5 years and at each renewal of the demonstration. a. The state must submit a draft budget neutrality workbook with revised PMPMs \u2014 and no more than the most recent 5 years of savings rollover \u2014by March 31, 2022 for the DY 17 rebase and March 31, 2027 for the DY 22 rebase . b. The new PMPMs and UC from the July 1, 2022 rebase will be effective from DY 17 to DY 21. c. The state must repeat the process outlined in this STC in preparation for another rebase to be implemen ted on July 1, 2027. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 68 of 95 d. The new PMPMs and UC from the July 1, 2027 rebase will be effective from DY 22 to DY 24. e. Once CMS has approved the state's rebasing workbooks, CMS will reissue STCs with updated PMPMs and publish on Medicaid.gov. f. CMS will also update budget neutrality monitoring workbooks in PMDA. 105. Impermissible DSH, Taxes or Donations. CMS reserves the right to adjust the BN ceiling to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new federal statutes, o r policy interpretations implemented throug h state Medicaid Director Letters, other memoranda or regulations. CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the BN cap if any health care related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider relat ed donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health care related ta x provisions of 1903(w) of the Social Security Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. 106. Composite Federal Share Ratio. The federal share of the BN expenditure limit is calculated by multiplying the limit times the Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share i s the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the approval period, as reported through MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedul e C, with consideration of allowable demonstration offsets such as premium collections, by TC demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. Composite Federal Share #1 is determined by applying the above calculation to expenditures reported under MEG 1 and MEG 2 combined. Composite Federal Share #2 is determined by applying the above calculation to expenditures reported under MEG 4. Composite Federal Share #3 is determined by applying the above calculation to expenditures reported under MEG 8. For the purpose of interim monitoring of BN, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or through an alternative mutually agreed to method. 107. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce BN over the life of the demonstration. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension may incorporate net savings from the immediately pr ior demonstration periods comprising DY 11 through 16 (but not from any earlier approval period). However, no later than 6 months after the end of each DY, the state will calculate an annual expendi ture target for the completed year and report it to CMS as part of the reporting guidelines in Section XVI. This amount will be compared with the actual FF P claimed by the state under BN. Using the schedule in Table 5 below as a guide for the PCCM budget limit, if the state exceeds the cumulative BN expenditure limit, they shall submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. The state will subsequentl y implement the ap proved program. Table 5.

Annual Budget Neutrality Report. On or before June 30, 2021, and on or before June 30 of each year thereafter, the state shall submit to CMS an Annual BN Monitoring Report, which will include an assessment of the demonstration's BN status based on actual expenditures to -date (including c omplete or nearly complete actual expenditures for the immediately preceding DY), the cumulative BN limit to -date, and updated projections for both the BN limit and WW expenditures through the end of the current approval period. If the state's actual expe nditures are found to have exceeded the cumulative BN limit by more than the percentages described in Table 5 above, or if the state's projections indicate that that actual cumulative spending are likely to exceed the BN limit for the approval period, the state must include corrective actions to ensure BN for the demonstration 109. Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool . The state will provide CMS with quarterly BN status updates via the reporting of demonstration expenditures in the BN Monitoring Tool provided through the Performance Metrics Database and Analytics (PMDA) system. The tool will be jointly developed with the state and incorporate the \"Schedule C Report\" for comparing demonstration's actual expenditures to the caps which are subject to BN expenditure li mits described in STC 94- 95. CMS will provide technical assistance, upon request. 110. Exceeding Budget Neutrality . If the BN expenditure limit has been exceeded at the end of the demonstration period, the excess federal funds must be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the BN agreement, the BN test shall be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. XIX. FINANCIAL AND ALLOTMENT NEUTRALITY MONITORING REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XXI 111. Scope of FFP for Title XXI Demonstration Expenditures. CMS will provide FFP only for the medical assistance services described in STC 61 and associated administrative expenditures. CMS will provide FFP as outlined below, subject to the state's title XXI Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 70 of 95 allotment limit: a. Administrative costs , including those associated with the administration of the demonstration. b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments that are paid in accordance with the approved CHIP state plan. c. Medical assistance expenditures made under this demonstration, net of enrollment fees, cost sharing, pharmacy rebates, and all other types of third party liability or CMS payment adjustments. 112. Reporting Expenditures Subject to the Title XXI Allotment . The following describes the reporting of title XXI expenditures authorized under this demonstration, subject to the state's title XXI allotment limit: a. Tracking Expenditures: In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, the state must report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following routine CMS-21 reporting instructions as outlined in section 2115 of the State Medicaid Manual. b. Use of Waiver Forms : Title XXI demonstration expenditures will be reported on separate Forms CMS -21 Waiver and/or CMS-21P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including project number extension, which indicates the demonstration year in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). The state must submit separate forms CMS -21 Waiver and/or CMS-21P Waiver using the waiver name \"Postpartum Extension.\" c. Claiming Period: All claims for expenditures related to the demonstration (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claim s for services during the demonstration period (including cost settlements) must be made within two years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two -year period, the state must continue to identify separately, on the F orm CMS -21 Waiver, net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration. 113. Standard CHIP Funding Process. The standard CHIP funding process will continue to be used during the demonstration. The state will continue to es timate matchable CHIP expenditures on the quarterly Form CMS- 21B. On a separate CMS -21B, the state shall provide updated estimates of expenditures for the CHIP demonstration population. CMS will make federal funds available based upon the state's estimat e, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS-21 quarterly CHIP expenditure report. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -21 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state . Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 71 of 95 114. Title XXI Administrative Costs. Administrative costs will not be included in the allotment neutrality limit, but the state must separately track and report additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration, using Forms CMS - 64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Wa iver, with waiver name \"CHIP ADM\". 115. Limit on Title XXI Funding. The state will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal title XXI funding that the state may receive on current eligible CHIP state plan populations and the demonstration population de scribed in STC 21(d) during the demonstration period. Federal title XXI funds for the state's CHIP program (i.e., the approved title XXI state plan and this demonstration) are restricted to the state's available allotment and reallocated funds. Title XXI funds (i.e., the allotment or reallocated funds) must first be used to fully fund costs associated with CHIP state plan populations. Demonstration expenditures are limited to remaining funds. 116. Exhaustion of Title XXI Funds. If the state exhausts the available title XXI federal funds in a federal fiscal year during the period of the demonstration, the state must continue to provide coverage to the approved title XXI state plan separate child health program population and the demonstration population descr ibed in STC 61 with state funds . XX. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 117. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. As required under 42 CFR 431.420(f), the state shall cooperate fully and timely with CMS an d its contractors in any federal evaluation of the demonstration or any component of the demonstration. This includes, but is not limited to, commenting on design and other federal evaluation docum ents and providing data and analytic files to CMS, including entering into a data use agreement that explains how the data and data files will be exchanged, and providing a technical point of contact to support specification of the data and files to be disclosed, as well as relevant data dictionaries and record layouts. The stat e shall include in its contracts with entities that collect, produce or maintain data and files for the demonstration, that they shall make such data available for the federal evaluation as is required under 42 CFR 431.420(f) to support federal evaluation. The state may claim administrative match for these activities. Failure to comply with this STC may result in a deferral being issued as outlined in STC 72. 118. Independent Evaluator. Upon approval of the demonstration, the state must arrange with an independent party to conduct an evaluation of the demonstration to ensure that the necessary data is collected at the level of detail needed to research the approved hypotheses. The state must require the independent party to sign an agree ment that the independent party will conduct the demonstration evaluation in an independent manner in accord with the CMS -approved Evaluation Design. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. 119. Draft Evaluation Design . The state must submit, for CMS comment and approval, a Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 72 of 95 draft Evaluation Design pertinent to th is demonstration extension period, no later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the approval of this extension . The draft Evaluation Design must be developed in accordance with Attachment B (Developing the Evaluation Design) of these STCs , and must include timeline for key evaluation activities including evaluation deliverables , as outlined in STCs 123 and 124. The state may choose to use the expertise of the independent party in the development of the draft Evaluation Design. The draft Evaluation Design must be developed in accordance with the following CMS guidance (including but not limited to): (a) Attachment B (Developing the Evaluation Design) of these STCs, and all applicable technical assistance on applying robust evaluation approaches, including how to establish causal inference and comparison groups in developing a strong Evaluation Design. (b) All applicable E valuation D esign guidance, including guidance about waiver of retroactive eligibility and overall demonstration sustainability. At a minimum, the draft Evaluation Design must include a discussion of the goals, objectives, and specific hypotheses that are being tested, in cluding those outlined in subparagraphs STC 1 21. The draft design will discuss: i. The outcome measures to be used in evaluating the impact of the demonstration during the period of approval, particularly among the target population; ii. The data sources and sampling methodology for assessing these outcomes; and iii. A detailed analysis plan that describes how the effects of the demonstration are isolated from other initiatives occurring in the state. 120. Evaluation Design Approval and Updates . The state must submit a revised draft Evaluation Design within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of CMS' comments. Upon CMS approval of the draft Evaluation Design, the document will be included as an attachment to these STCs. Per 42 CFR 431.424(c), the state will publish the approved Evaluation Design within thirty (30) days of CMS approval. The state must implement the Evaluation D esign and submit a description of its evaluation implementation progress in each of the Monitoring Reports . Once CMS approves the E valuation D esign, if the state wishes to make changes, the state must submit a revised E valuation D esign to CMS for approval if the changes are substantial in scope; otherwise, in consultation with CMS, the state may include updates to the Evaluation Design in Monitoring Reports . 121. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses. Consistent with Attachments B and C (Developing the Evaluatio n Design and Preparing the Evaluation Report s) of these STCs, the evaluation documents must include a discussion of the evaluation questions and hypotheses that the state intends to test. Each demonstration component should have at Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 73 of 95 least one evaluation qu estion and hypothesis. The hypothesis testing should include, where possible, assessment of both process and outcome measures. Proposed measures should be selected from nationally -recognized sources and national measures sets, where possible. Measures s ets could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS) , the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid - Eligible Adults and/or m easures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). The evaluation must outline and address well -crafted hypotheses and research questions for all of the following demonstration components: a. The effect of managed care on access to care, quality and efficiency of care, and the cost of care; b. The effect of customized benefit plans on beneficiaries' choice of plans, access to care, or quality of care; c. Participation in the Healthy Behav iors programs and its effect on participant behavior or health status; d. The impact of LIP funding on hospital charity care programs; e. The impact of efforts to align with Medicare and improving beneficiary experiences and outcomes for dual -eligible individuals; f. The effectiveness of enrolling individuals into a managed care pl an upon eligibility determination in connecting beneficiaries with care in a timely manner; g. The effect the Statewide Medicaid Prepaid Dental Health Program has on accessibility, quality, utilization, and cost of dental health care services ; h. The impact of the waiver of retroactive eligibility on beneficiaries and providers. Hypotheses for the waiver of retroactive eligibility must relate to (but are not limited to) the following outcomes: likelihood of enrollment and enrollment continuity, enrollment when people are healthy, and health status (as a result of greater enrollment continuity). i. The impact of the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot on beneficiaries who are 21 and older with serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD) or SMI with co -occurring SUD, and are homeless or at risk of homelessness due to their disability. j. The impact of extending postpartum coverage from the end of the month in which the 60th postpartum day occurs to the end of the 12th month followi ng the end of the pregnancy . k. In addition, the state must investigate cost outcomes for the demonstration as a whole, including but not limited to: administrative costs of demonstration implementation and operation, Medicaid health service expenditures, and provider uncompensated costs . Finally, the state must use results of hypothesis tests and cost analyses to assess demonstration effects on Medicaid program sustainability. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 74 of 95 The findings from each evaluation component must be integrated to help inform whether the state met the overall demonstration goals, with recommendations for future efforts regarding all components. 122. Evaluation Budget. A budget for the evaluation shall be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include the total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, administrative and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation such as any survey and measurement development, quantitative and qualitative data collection and cleaning, analyses and report gener ation. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the estimates provided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the design or if CMS finds that the design is not sufficiently developed , or if the estimates appear to be excessive. 123. Interim Evaluation Report s. The state must submit three Interim Evaluation Report s for the completed years of the demonstration specified in subparagraph c , and for each subsequent renewal or extension of the demonstration, as outlined in 42 CFR 431.412(c)(2)(vi). When submitting an application for renewal, the Evaluation Report should be posted to the state's website with the application for public comment. a. The Interim E valuation R eport s will discuss evaluation progress and present findings to date as per the approved E valuation Design , and address the evaluat ion questions described in STC 1 21. b. For demonstration authority that expires prior to the overall demonstration's expiration date, the Interim Evaluation Report (s) must include an evaluation of the authority as approved by CMS. c. The state must provide draft Interim Evaluation Report s for the corresponding years described below. The state must submit a revised Interim Evaluation Report for each Interim Evaluation Report sixty (60) calendar days after receiving CMS comments on the corresponding draft report . The final version of each of the Interim Evaluation Reports must be posted to the state's Medicai d website within thirty ( 30) calendar days of approval by CMS . i. A Draft Interim Evaluation Report for demonstration years 15- 17 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2023) will be due no later than December 31, 2024. ii. A Draft Interim Evaluation Report for demonstration years 15- 19 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2025) will be due no later than December 31, 2026. iii. A Draft Interim Evaluation Report for demonstration years 15- 22 (July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2028) will be due no later than December 31, 2029. d. If the state is seeking to renew or extend the demonstration, the draft Interim Evaluation Report , representing demonstration years 15- 22 (July Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 75 of 95 1, 2020 - June 30, 2028) is due when the application for renewal is submitted. If the state is not requesting a demonstration extension , the last draft Interim Evaluation R eport , as noted in c(iii) above, is due one (1) year prior to the end of the demonstration. For demonstration phase -outs prior to the expiration of the approval period, the draft Interim Evaluation Report is due to CMS on the date that will be specified in the notice of termination or suspension. e. The Interim Evaluation Report s must comply with Attachment C (Preparing the Evaluation Report s) of these STCs. 124. Summative Evaluation Report. The draft Summative Evaluation Report must be developed in accordance with Attachment C (Preparing the Evaluation Report s) of these STCs. The state must submit a draft Summative Evaluation Report for the demonstration's current approval period by December 31, 2031 (i.e., within 18 months of the end of the approval period represented by these STCs . The Summative Evaluation Report must include the information in the approved Evaluation Design. a. Unless otherwise agreed upon in wri ting by CMS, the state shall submit a revised Summative Evaluation Report within sixty ( 60) calendar days of receiving comments from CMS on the draft . b. The final Summative Evaluation Report must be posted to the state's Medicaid website within thirty (30) calendar days of approval by CMS. 125. Corrective Action Plan Related to Evaluation . If evaluation findings indicate that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require th e state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. These discussions may also occur as part of a renewal process when associated with the state's Interim Evaluation Report(s). A state corrective action plan could include a temporary suspensi on of implementation of demonstration programs, in circumstances where evaluation findings indicate substantial and sustained directional change inconsistent with state targets (such as substantial and sustained trends indicating increased difficulty acces sing services, increases in provider uncompensated care costs) . A corrective action plan may be an interim step to withdrawing waivers or expenditure authorities, as outlined in STC 10. CMS would further have the ability to suspend implementation of the demonstration should corrective actions not effectively resolve these concerns in a timely manner. 126. State Presentations for CMS. CMS reserves the right to request that the state present and participate in a discussion with CMS on the Evaluation Design, the Interim Evaluation Reports, and/or the Summative Evaluation Report. Presentation may be conducted remotely. 127. Public Access. The State shall post the final documents (e.g., Monitoring Reports, Close Out Report, approved Evaluation Design, Interim Evaluati on Report s, and Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 76 of 95 Summative Evaluation Report) on the state's Medicaid website within thirty ( 30) calendar days of approval by CMS. 128. Additional Publications and Presentations. For a period of twelve (12) months following CMS approval of the final reports, CMS will be notified prior to presentation of these reports or their findings, including in related publications (including, for example, journal articles), by the state , contractor, or any other third party directly connected to the demonstration over which the state has control . Prior to release of these reports, articles or other publications, CMS will be provided a copy including any associated press materials. CMS will be given ten (10) business days to review and comment on publications before they are released. CMS may choose to decline to comment or review some or all o f these notifications and reviews. This requirement does not apply to the release or presentation of these materials to state or local government officials. XXI. MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO CARE IMPROVEMENT 129. External Quality Review (EQR). The state is required to meet all requirements for external quality review (EQR) found in 42 CFR Part 438, subpart E. In addition to routine encounter data validation processes that take place at the MCO/PIHP and state level, the state must maintain its contract with its external quality review organization (EQRO) to require the independent annual validation of encounter dat a for all MCOs and PIHPs. 130. Consumer Health Plan Report Cards. On an annual basis, the state must create and make readily available to beneficiaries, providers, and other interested stakeholders, a health plan report card, in a format compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794d), that is based on performance data on each managed care plan included in the annual EQR technical report. Each health plan report card must be posted on the state's website and present an easily understandable summary of quality, access, and timeliness regarding the performance of each participating plan. The report cards must also address the performance of subcontracted dental plans. 131. Performance Improvement Projects (PIP). In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.330, the state must require each managed care plan, including each dental plan, to commit to improving care. In lieu of Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs) identified by CMS as described in \u00a7 438.330(a)(2), the state must require each managed care plan, including each dental plan to complete PIPs in the following focus areas, which have the significant potential for achieving the demonstration's goals of improving patient care, population health, and reducing per capita Medicaid expenditure. Specialty plans that do not have sufficient numbers of eligible recipients for the PIP topics identified in 126(a) or 126(b) may conduct alternative PIPs on topics more relevant to their enrolled population in place of the required focus areas, subject to approval by the state. a. A PIP combining a focus on improving primary C -section rates, pre- term delivery rates, and neonatal abstinence syndrome rates; Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 77 of 95 b. A PIP focused on reducing potentially preventable events, including hospital admissio ns, readmissions, and emergency department visits; c. An administrative PIP focusing on the administration of the transportation benefit, specifically focusing on the rate of trips resulting in the enrollee arriving to their scheduled appointment on time; and d. A PIP focused on improving follow -up after hospitalizations for mental illness, emergency department visits for mental illness, and emergency department visits for alcohol and other drug abuse or dependence . e. Dental plans shall perform three PIPs as follows: i. A PIP focused on increasing the rate of enrollees accessing preventive dental services; ii. A PIP focused on reducing potentially preventable dental -related emergency department visits in collaboration with the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) plans. iii. An administrative PIP focused on coordination of transportation services with the SMMC plans. f. The state must conduct each PIP in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.330 and 438.340. The state will meet its obligations under the regulations. 132. Measurement Acti vities. The state must ensure that each participating managed care plan is accountable for metrics on quality and access, including measures to track progress in identified quality improvement focus areas, measures to track quality broadly, and measures to track access. The state must set performance tar gets that equal or exceed the 75th percentile national Medicaid performance level. In addition to requirements set forth at 42 CFR \u00a7 438.330 through 438.334, the state mus t collect data and information on dental care utilization rates, the CMS Medicaid and CHIP adult and child core measures, and must align with other existing federal measure sets where possible to en sure ongoing monitoring of individual well -being and plan performance. The state will use thi s information in ongoing monitoring and quality improvement efforts, in addition to quality reporting efforts.

The state implemented the demonstration July 1, 2006, in Broward and Duval Counties, and then expanded to Baker, Clay, and Nassau Counties July 1, 2007. On December 15, 2011, CMS agreed to extend the demonstration through June 30, 2014. T he December 2011 renewal included several important improvements to the demonstration, such as; enhanced managed care requirements to ensure increased stability amo ng managed care plans, minimize plan turnover, and provide for an improved transition and continuity of care when enrollees change plans and to ensure adequate choice of providers. The renewal also included a Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirement of 85 percent for Medicaid operations. Finally, the renewal included the continuation of the Low Income Pool (LIP) of $1 billion (TC) annually to assist safety net providers in providing health care services to Medicaid, underinsured and uninsured populations. On June 14, 2013, CMS approved an amendment to the demonstration, which retains all of the improvements noted above, but allowed the state to extend an improved model of managed care to all counties in Florida subject to approval of an implementation plan and a determination of readiness based on the elements of the approved plan. The amendment also changed the name of the demonstration to the Florida Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) program. CMS authorized implementation to begin no earlier than January 1, 2014, with the Medicaid Reform demonstration continuing to operate in the five Medicaid Reform counties until the MMA program was implemented there. U nder the June 2013 amended demonstration, most Medicaid eligibles were required to enroll in a managed care plan (either a capitated managed care plan or a FFS Provider Service Network (PSN)) as a condition for receiving Medicaid. Enrollment was mandatory for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) -related populations and the aged and disabled, with some exceptions. The demonstration continued to allow plans to offer customized benefit packages and reduced cost sharing, although each plan must cover all mandatory services, and all state plan services for children and pregnant women (including Early and P eriodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT)). The demonstration provided incentives for healthy behaviors by offering Enhanced Benefits Accounts that were replaced by the plan's Healthy Behaviors program upon implementation of the MMA program as described in STC 54. Beneficiaries in counties transitioning from Medicaid Reform to MMA continued to have access to their accrued credits under Enhanced Benefit Account Program (EBAP) for one year. T he June 2013 amended terms and conditions included improvements such as: A phased implementation to ensure readiness including a readiness assessment for each region and a requirement for CMS approval of the state's implementation plan whichwill include identified r isks, mitigation strategies, fail safes, stakeholder engagementFlorida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 80 of 95 and rapid cycle improvement strategies; Strengthened auto -enrollment criteria to ensure consideration of network capacity, access, continuity of care, and preservation of existing patient-provider relationships when enrolling all beneficiaries into the MMA program, including special populations; STCs tailored to special populations, should the state choose to include specialty plansin the final selection of managed care entities and PSNs; Strong consumer protections to ensure bene ficiary assistance and continuity of care through the MMA transition. Additional STCs to ensure beneficiary choice, including a comprehensive outreach plan to educate and communicate with beneficiaries,providers, and stakeholders and annual Health Plan Report Cards for consumers,which will allow beneficiaries to be more informed on health plan performance andassist beneficiaries in making informed decisions related to plan selection; Enhanced Medical Care Advisory Committee (MCAC) requirements to ensurebeneficiary and advocate group participation as well as inclusion of sub-population advisory committees; Performance Improvement Projects (PIP) to be performed by all health plans; Clarification and enhancements of the monitoring and evaluation of plans to ensure a rigorous and independent evaluation, and development of rapid cycle, transparentmonitoring in order to ensure continuous progress towards quality improvement; and, A Comprehensive Quality Strategy (CQS) that will span the entire Florida Medicaid program. T he approved 2014 extension of the demonstration continued the improvements authorized in the June 2013 amendment and extended all portions of this demonstration for three years, except for the Low Income Pool (LIP). CMS authorized extension of the Low Income Pool for one year, from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015. D uring the one-year extension for the LIP, expenditures were authorized to provide stability for providers for a limited time during Florida's transition to statewideMedicaid managed care and a significantly reformed Medicaid payment system.Funding sources were limited only to existing state and local funding arrangements.The total amount of LIP funding could not exceed $2,167,718,341 (TC). Florida was required to analyze and develop a plan to reform Medicaid providerpayments and funding mechanisms, with the goal of developing sustainable,transparent, equitable, appropriate, accountable, and actuarially sound Medicaidpayment systems and funding mechanisms that ensure qualit y health care services to Florida's Medicaid beneficiaries throughout the state without the need for LIP funding.Expenditures authorized under the LIP were limited to UC costs of providers, theindependent report discussed below, and other categories of expenditure as specified inthe STCs. UC costs were required to be verified through provider cost reports. CMS indicated that it would disallow unallowable payments to providers in prior DYs as identified on provider cost reports. During the one- year LIP ex tension, the state was required to use a portion of the LIPFlorida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 81 of 95 funds to commission a report from an independent entity on Medicaid provider payment in the state that reviews the adequacy of payment levels, and the adequacy, equity, accountability and sustaina bility of the State's funding mechanisms for these payments. The report was required to recommend reforms to the Florida Medicaid financing system that can allow the state, beginning in state fiscal year (SFY) 2015 -2016, to move toward Medicaid FFS and ma naged care payments that ensure access for Medicaid beneficiaries to providers without payments through the LIP. The final report was due no later than March 1, 2015. On June 30, 2015, pursuant to a letter to the state, CMS granted 60 days of interim expenditure authority under section 1115(a)(2) of the Social Security Act, to make federal funding available to Florida for interim LIP payments to providers from July 1, 2015 through August 31, 2015 of DY (DY) 10, subject to a total spending limit of $166.66 million for the combined federal and state shares of expenditures (with such amount being counted in determining the amount of any further extension of the Low Income Pool). On October 15, 2015, CMS approved three amendments to the demonstration. The fir st amendment added two populations as voluntary enrollees in managed care: Medicaid -eligible children receiving Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) services, and recipients residing in group home facilities licensed under section(s) 393.067 Florida Statutes (FS). The second amendment authorized changes to managed care enrollment to auto-assign individuals into managed care during a plan choice period immediately after eligibility determination. The amendment also changes the auto -assignment criteria. Individuals will receive both their managed care plan assignment and information about choice of plans in their area. Individuals may actively select a plan during a 120-day change/disenrollment period post-enrollment. The third amendment authorized expenditures under the LIP through June 30, 2017. The total amount of LIP funding in DY 10 (July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016) will not exceed $1 billion (TC). The total amount of LIP funding in DY 11 (July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017) will not exceed $607,825,452 milli on (TC). The changes represent a transition to a LIP that reflects the cost to providers of UC for uninsured individuals in the state, and that no longer pays for care that may be or has been provided through available coverage options. The changes set Flo rida on a path to administering a LIP in 2016- 2017 (DY 11) that distributes funds based on the burden placed on providers by services for low - income, uninsured individuals for whom no other coverage options are, or could be, made available. On October 12, 2016, CMS approved three amendments, which modified the demonstration to: (a) allow Florida flexibility to contract with one to three ve ndors under the hemophilia program; (b) Include payments for nursing facility (NF) services in MMA capitation rates for recipients under the age of 18 years; and (c) allow flexibility for specialt y plans to conduct Perfo rmance Improvement Projects (PIP) on topics that have more specific impacts to their Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 82 of 95 enrollees, with Florida approval.11 Under the demonstration, Florida seeks to continue building on the following objectives: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility . The demonstration seeks to improve care for Medicaid beneficiaries by providing care through nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state will provide oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality of care. Improving program performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as HEDIS scores), through expanding key components of the Medicai d managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care except those specifically exempted due to short -term eligibility, limited service eligibility, or institutional placement (other than nursing home care). Increasing access to, stabilizing , and strengthening providers that serve uninsured, low- income populations in the state by targeting LIP funding to reimburse UC costs for services provided to low -income uninsured patients at hospitals that are furnished through charity care programs tha t adhere to the (HFMA) principles. 12 On August 1, 2017, CMS reauthorized the MMA Medicaid managed care program for the 5- year extension without significant changes to the program. The revised STCs for the extension reflected the state's obligation to follo w the Medicaid managed care regulations at 42 CFR 438, and CMS and Florida agreed to several revisions to the STCs that previously governed the state's LIP. The revised LIP calculations reflected in the extension STCs led to a new TC annual LIP limit of $1 .5 billion per DY \u2014which was an annual increase of approximately $900 million compared to the previous DY's LIP amount. There were two changes which led to the increased annual LIP limit: CMS' analysis of more recent Florida hospital cost report data led to an increase of $450 million in annual LIP; and CMS did not apply the previous LIP reduction for Medicaid expansion which led to an additional increase of $450 million annually \u2014this was the only significant change to CMS' previous methodology for determi ning UC amounts. Consistent with CMS' goal of lessening or removing unduly burdensome and/or duplicative state reporting requirements, where appropriate, the extension STCs also omitted the requirement for quarterly reporting on all MMA demonstration acti vities (although 11 For the \"Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives,\" see Attachment B. 12 http://www.hfma.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=14589 Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 83 of 95 expenditures continue to be reported quarterly, and annual reporting is required, consistent with the statutory requirement of periodic state reports). In addition, the requirement for the state to submit the LIP Reimbursement and Funding Methodology (RFMD) document for the first extension DY \u2014with subsequent annual attestations that the methodology remains in effect. CMS also eliminated the requirement for a Comprehensive Quality Strategy in the extension; however, the state still is required to develop and maintain a managed care quality strategy as required under 42 CFR \u00a7438.340.

The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provides important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need rigorous quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. C MS expects evaluation designs to be rigorous, incorporate baseline and comparison group assessments, as well as statistical significance testing. Technical assistance resources for constructing comparison groups, identifying causal inferences, phasing implementation to support evaluation, and designing and administering beneficiary surveys are available on Medicaid.gov: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section -1115- demo/evaluation- reports/evaluation- designs -and-reports/index.html. If the state needs additional technical assistance using this o utline or developing the evaluation design, the state should contact the demonstration team. E xpectations for Evaluation Designs All states with Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation, and the Evaluation Design is the roadmap for conducting the evaluation. The roadmap begins with the stated goals for the demonstration followed by the measurable evaluation questions and quantifiable hypotheses, all to support a determination of the extent to which the demonstration has achieved its goals. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances T he format for the Evaluation Design is as follows: A.General Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 85 of 95 There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Desig n and Reports. (The graphic below depicts an example of a deliverables timeline for a 5 -year demonstration). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. The state is required to publish the Evaluation Design to the state's website within thirty ( 30) calendar days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(e). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. R equired Core Components of All Evaluation Designs The Evaluation Design sets the stage for the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. It is important that the Evaluation Design explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology (and limitations) for the evaluation. A copy of the S tate's Driver Diagram (described in more detail in paragraph B2 below) should be included with an explanation of the depicted information. A.General Background Information - In this section, the state should includebasic information about the demonstration, such as: 1.The issue/s that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstrationand/or expenditure authorities, the potential magnitude of the issue/s, and why thestate selected this course of action to address the issue/s (e.g., a narrative on whythe state submitted an 1115 demonstration proposal). 2.The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period oftime covered by the evaluation; 3.A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, andwhether the draft Evaluation Design applies to an amendment, extension,renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4.For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of anychanges to the demonstration during the approval period; the primary reason orreasons for the change; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented toaddress these changes. 5.Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 86 of 95 B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1. Describe how the state's demonstration goals are translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. 2. Include a Driver Diagram to visually aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the cause and effect of the variants behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. A driver diagram is a particularly effective modeling tool when working to improve health and health care through specific interventions. The diagram includes information about the goal of the demonstration, and the features of the demonstration. A driver diagram depicts the relationship between the aim, the primary drivers th at contribute directly to achieving the aim, and the secondary drivers that are necessary to achieve the primary drivers for the demonstration. For an example and more information on driver diagrams: https://innovation.cms.gov/files/x/hciatwoaimsdrvrs.pdf 3. Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration: a. Discuss how the evaluation questions align with the hypotheses and the goals of the demonstration; b. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and/or XXI. C. Methodology - In this section, the state is to describe in d etail the proposed research methodology. The focus is on showing that the evaluation meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable, and that where appropriate it builds upon other published research (use references). This section provides the evidence that the demons tration evaluation will use the best available data; reports on, controls for, and makes appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what will be measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes: 1. Evaluation Design - Provide information on how the evaluation will be designed. For example, will the evaluation utilize a pre/post comparison? A post-only assessment? Will a comparison group be included? 2. Target and Comparison Populations - Describe the characteristics of the target and comparison populations, to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Include information about the level of analysis (beneficiary, provider, or program level), and if populations will be stratified into subgroups. Additionally, discuss the sampling methodology for the populations, as well as s upport that a statistically reliable sample size is available. 3. Evaluation Period - Describe the time periods for which data will be included. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 87 of 95 4. Evaluation Measures - List all measures that will be calculated to evaluate the demonstration. Include the measure stewards (i.e., the organization(s) responsible for the evalu ation data elements/sets by \"owning\", defining, validating; securing; and submitting for endorsement, etc.) Include numerator and denominator information. Additional items to ensure: a. The measures contain assessments of both process and outcomes to evaluat e the effects of the demonstration during the period of approval. b. Qualitative analysis methods may be used, and must be described in detail. c. Benchmarking and comparisons to national and state standards should be used, where appropriate. d. Proposed health measures could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults and /or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). e. Proposed performance metrics can be selected from nationally recognized metrics, for example from sets developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation or for meaningful use under Health Information Technology (HIT). f. Among considerations in selecting the metrics shall be opportunities identified by the state for improving quality of care and health outcomes, and controlling cost of care. 5. Data Sources - Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. Discuss the quality and limitations of the data sources. If primary data (data collected specifically for the evaluation) - The methods by which the data will be collected, the source of the proposed question/responses, the frequency and timing of data collection, and the method of data collection. Copies of any proposed surveys must be reviewed with CMS for approval before implementation . 6. Analytic Methods - This section includes the details of the selected quantitative and/or qualitative measures to adequately assess the effectiveness of the demonstration. This section should: a. Identify the specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measure (e.g., t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression). Table A is an example of how the state might want to articulate the analytic methods for each research question and measure. b. Explain how the state will isolate the effects of the demonstration (from other initiatives occurring in the state at the same time) through the use of comparison groups. c. A discussion of how propensity score matching and difference -in-differences design may be used to adjust for differences in comparison populations over Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 88 of 95 time (if applicable). d.The application of sensitivity analyses, as appropriate, should be considered. 7.Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the Evaluation Design of the demonstration.Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 89 of 95 Table A.

Methodological Limitations - This section provides detailed information on the limitations of the evaluation. This could include the design, the data sources or collection process, or analytic methods. The state should also ident ify any efforts to minimize the limitations. Additionally, this section should include any information about features of the demonstration that effectively present methodological constra ints that the state would like CMS to take into consideration in its review. E. Special Methodological Considerations - CMS recognizes that there may be certain instances where a state cannot meet the rigor of an evaluation as expected by CMS. In these instances, the state should document for CMS why it is not able to incorporate key components of a rigorous evaluation, including comparison groups and baseline data analyses. Examples of considerations include: 1. When the state demonstration is: a. Long -standing, non-complex, unchanged, or b. Has previously been rigorously evaluated and found to be successful, or c. Could now be considered standard Medicaid policy (CMS published regulations or guidance) 2. When the demonstration is also considered successful without issues or concerns that would require more regular reporting, such as: a.

No or minimal appeals and grievances; and c. No state issues with CMS 64 reporting or BN; and d. No Corrective Action Plans (CAP) for the demonstration. F. Attachments 1. Independent Evaluator. This includes a discussion of the state's process for obtaining an independent entity to conduct the evaluation, including a description of the qualifications that the selected entity must possess, and how the state will assure no conflict of interest. Ex plain how the state will assure that the Independent Evaluator will conduct a fair and impartial evaluation, prepare an objective Evaluation Report, and that there would be no conflict of interest. The Evaluation D esign should include a \"No Conflict of Interest\" statement signed by the independent evaluator. 2. Evaluation Budget. A budget for implementing the evaluation shall be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include the total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, a dministrative, and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation. Examples include, but are not limited to, the development of all survey and measurement instruments; quantitative and qualitative data collection; data cleaning and analyses; and reports ge neration. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the estimates provided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the draft Evaluation Design, if CMS finds that the draft Evaluation Design is not sufficiently developed , or if the estimates appear to be excessive. 3. Timeline and Major Milestones. Describe the timeline for conducting the various evaluation activities, including dates for evaluation- related milestones, including those related to procurement of an outside contractor, i f applicable, and deliverables. The Final Evaluation Design shall incorporate the Interim Evaluation Reports and Summative Evaluation. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.424(c)(v), this timeline should also include the date by which the Final Summative Evaluation report is due. Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 91 of 95 ATTACHMENT C PREPARING THE EVALUATION REPORT S I ntroduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demonstrations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provide important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need rigorous quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. E xpectations for Evaluation Reports Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct evaluations that are valid (the extent to which the evaluation measures what it is intended to measure), and reliable (the extent to which the evalu ation could produce the same results when used repeatedly). To this end, the already -approved Evaluation Design is a map that begins with the demonstration goals, then transitions to the evaluation questions, and to the specific hypotheses, which will be used to investigate whether the demonstration has achieved its goals. States should have a well- structured analysis plan for their evaluation. With the following kind of information, states and CMS are best poised to inform and shape Medicaid policy in order to improve the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries for decades to come. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. When submitting an application for renewal, the final I nterim Evaluation Report should be posted on the state's website with the application for public comment. Additionally, the I nterim Evaluation Reports must be included in their entirety with the application submitted to CMS. I ntent of this Attachment Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires an evaluation of every section 1115 demonstration. In order to fulfill this requirement, the state's submission must provide a comprehensive w ritten presentation of all key components of the demonstration, and include all required elements specified in the approved Evaluation Design. This Attachment is intended to assist states with organizing the required information in a standardized format and understanding the criteria that CMS will use in reviewing the submitted Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. T he format for the Interim and Summative Evaluation reports are as follows: A.Executive Summary; B.General Background Information;Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 F.Results; G.Conclusions; Other State Initiatives; I.Lessons Learned and Recommendations; and J.Attachment(s). S ubmission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Designs and Evaluation Reports. These dates are specified in the demo nstration Special Terms and Conditions (STCs). (The graphic below depicts an example of a deliverables timeline for a 5 -year demonstration). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public recor ds. In order to assure the dissemination of the evaluation findings, lessons learned, and recommendations, the state is required to publish the Evaluation D esign and reports to the state's website within 30 calendar days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(d). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. R equired Core Components of Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports T he section 1115 Evaluation Reports present the research about the section 1115 Demonstration. It is important that the report incorporate a discussion about the structure of the Evaluation Design to explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology for the evaluation. A copy of the S tate's Driver Diagram (described in the Evaluation Design Attachment) must be included with an explanation of the depicted information. The Evalu ation Reports should present the relevant data and an interpretation of the findings; assess the outcomes (what worked and what did not work); explain the limitations of the design, data, and anal yses; offer recommendations regarding what (in hindsight) th e state would further advance, or do differently, and why; and discuss the implications on future Medicaid policy. Therefore, the state's submission must include: A.Executive Summary - A summary of the demonstration, the principal Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 93 of 95 results, interpretations, and recommendations of the evaluation. B. General Background Information about the Demonstration - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1) The issues that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, how the state became aware of the issue, the potential magnitude of the issue, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issues. 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and if the evaluation is for an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; whether the motivation for change was due to political, economic, and fiscal factors at the state and/or federal level; whether the pro grammatic changes were implemented to improve beneficiary health, provider/health plan performance, or administrative efficiency; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by t he demonstration. C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals were translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. The inclusion of a Driver Diagram in the Evaluation Report is highly encouraged, as the visual can aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. 2) Identify the state's h ypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration: a. Discuss how the goals of the demonstration align with the evaluation questions and hypotheses; b. Explain how this Evaluation Report builds upon and expands earlier demonstration evaluation findings (if applicable); and c. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and XXI. D. Methodology - In this section, the state is to provide an overview of the research Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 94 of 95 that was conducted to evaluate the section 1115 demonstration consistent with the approved Evaluation Design. The E valuation Design should also be included as an attachment to the report. The focus is on showing that the evaluation builds upon other published research (use references), an d meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable. The interim reports should provide any available data to date, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The Evaluation Design should assure there is appropriate data development and col lection in a timely manner to support developing interim evaluation s. This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation used the best available data and descri bes why potential alternative data sources were not used; reported on, controlled for, and made appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what was measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes that the approved Evaluation Design was followed by describing: 1) Evaluation Design\u2014Will the evaluation be an assessment of: pre/post, post - only, with or without comparison groups, etc.? 2) Target and Comparison Populations \u2014Describe the target and comparison populations; include inclusion and exclusion criteria. 3) Evaluation Period\u2014 Describe the time periods for which data will be collected . 4) Evaluation Measures \u2014What measures are used to evaluate the demonstration, and who are the measure stewards? 5) Data Sources \u2014Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. 6) Analytic methods \u2014Identify specific statistical testing whic h will be undertaken for each measure (t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression, etc.). 7) Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the evaluation of the demonstration. E. Methodological Limitations This section provides sufficient information for discerning the strengths and weaknesses of the study design, data sources/collection, and analyses. F. Results - In this section, the state presents and uses the quantitative and qualitative data to show to whether and to what degree the evaluation questions and hypotheses of the demonstration were achieved. The findings should visually depict the Florida Managed Medical Assistance Demonstration Approval Period: January 15, 2021 through June 30, 2030 Amended: May 25, 2022 95 of 95 demonstration results (tables, charts, graphs). This section should include information on the statistical tests conducted. G.Conclusions - In this section, the state will present the conclusions about the evaluation results. 1)In general, did the results show that the demonstration was/was not effective in achieving the goals and objectives established at the beginning of the demonstration? 2)Based on the findings, discuss the outcomes and impacts of the demonstration and identify the opportunities for improvements. Specifically: a.If the state did not fully achieve its intended goals, why not? What could bedone in the future that would better enable such an effort to more fully achievethose purposes, aims, objectives, and goals? H.Interpretations, Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives-In this section, the state will discuss the section 1115 demonstration within an overall Medicaid context and long range planning. This should include interrelations of thedemonstration with other aspects of the state's Medicaid program, interactions withother Medicaid demonstrations, and other federal awards affecting service delivery,health outcomes and the cost of care under Medicaid. This section provides the statewith an opportunity to provide interpretation of the data using evaluative reasoning tomake judgments about the demonstration. This section should also include adiscussion of the implications of the findings at both the state and national levels. I.Lessons Learned and Recommendations - This section of the Evaluation Reportinvolves the transfer of knowledge. Specifically, the \"opportunities\" for future orrevised demonstrations to inform Medicaid policymakers, advocates, and stakeholdersis just as significant as identifying current successful strategies. Based on theevaluation results: 1)What lessons were learned as a result of the demonstration? 2)What would you recommend to other states, which may be interested in implementing a similar approach? J.Attachment 1)Evaluation Design: Provide the CMS-approved Evaluation DesignCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) logo blank blank blank blank blank blank Medicaid Section 1115 Eligibility and Coverage Demonstrations Monitoring Protocol (Version 2.0) blank blank End of worksheetOverview: The Monitoring Protocol for the section 1115 eligibility and coverage demonstrations consists of a Monitoring Protocol Workbook (Part A) and a Monitoring Protocol Template (Part B). Each state with an approved eligibility and coverage policy in its section 1115 demonstration should complete only one Monitoring Protocol Workbook (Part A) that encompasses all eligibility and coverage policies approved in its demonstration as well as the demonstration overall, in accordance with the demonstration's special terms and conditions (STCs). This state-specific Part A Workbook reflects the composition of the eligibility and coverage policies in the state's demonstration. For more information and any questions, the state should contact the CMS section 1115 demonstration team. ATTACHMENT D: APPROVED MONITORING PROTCOL Overview: The Monitoring Protocol for the section 1115 eligibility and coverage demonstrations consists of a Monitoring Protocol Workbook (Part A) and a Monitoring Protocol Template (Part B). Each state with an approved eligibility and coverage demonstration should complete one Monitoring Protocol Template that encompasses every eligibility and coverage policy in its demonstration and the demonstration overall, as outlined in the state's special terms and conditions (STC).1 CMS will work with the state to ensure there is no duplication in the reporting requirements for different policy components of the demonstration. Each state with an approved eligibility and coverage demonstration should complete one Monitoring Protocol Template (Part B) that applies to each eligibility and coverage policy in its demonstration and the demonstration overall (unlike Part A where every eligibility and coverage policy included in the state's demonstration, as well as the demonstration overall, has a separate section for the state to complete). This state-specific template reflects the composition of the eligibility and coverage policies in the state's demonstration. For more information, the state should contact the section 1115 eligibility and coverage demonstration monitoring and evaluation mailbox (1115MonitoringandEvaluation@cms.hhs.gov ), copying the state's CMS demonstration team on the message. 1 States should complete Parts A and B for any of the following eligibility and coverage policies included in the demonstration: premiums or account payments, health behavior incentives, community engagement, retroactive eligibility waivers, and non-eligibility periods. There is no standalone Monitoring Protocol Workbook for non- eligibility periods policies. Monitoring metrics that capture non-eligibility periods are captured as part of other standard eligibility and coverage monitoring metrics. For other eligibility and coverage policies that do not have a Monitoring Protocol, such as waiver of non-emergency medical transportation and marketplace-focused premium assistance, states should follow the guidance in the STCs.

Title page for the state's eligibility and coverage demonstrations or eligibility and coverage policy components of the broader demonstration The state should complete this title page as part of its eligibility and coverage monitoring protocol. This section collects information on the approval features of the state's section 1115 demonstration overall, followed by information for each eligibility and coverage policy. This form should be submitted as the title page for all eligibility and coverage monitoring reports. The content of this table should stay consistent over time. Definitions for certain rows are provided below the table. Overall section 1115 demonstration State Florida. Demonstration name Managed Medical Assistance Waiver Approval period for section 1115 demonstration 01/15/2021 - 06/30/2030 Health behavior incentives Health behavior incentives start datea 01/15/2021 Implementation date, if different from health behavior incentives start dateb N/A Retroactive eligibility waiver Retroactive eligibility waiver start date 01/15/2021 Implementation date, if different from retroactive eligibility waiver start date N/A a Eligibility and coverage demonstration start date: For monitoring purposes, CMS defines the start date of the demonstration as the effective date listed in the state's STCs at time of eligibility and coverage demonstration approval. For example, if the state's STCs at the time of eligibility and coverage demonstration approval note that the demonstration is effective January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2025, the state should consider January 1, 2020 to be the start date of the demonstration. Note that that the effective date is considered to be the first day the state may begin its eligibility and coverage demonstration. In many cases, the effective date is distinct from the approval date of a demonstration; that is, in certain cases, CMS may approve a section 1115 demonstration with an effective date that is in the future. For example, CMS may approve an extension request on December 15, 2020, with an effective date of January 1, 2021 for the new demonstration period. In many cases, the effective date also differs from the date a state begins implementing its demonstration. b Implementation date of policy: The date of implementation for each eligibility and coverage policy in the state's demonstration.Medicaid Section 1115 Eligibility and Coverage Demonstrations Monitoring Protocol - Part B Version 2.0 Florida Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) 3 2.Acknowledgement of narrative reporting requirements The state has reviewed the narrative questions in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the Monitoring Report Template provided by the CMS demonstration team and understands the expectations for quarterly and annual monitoring reports. The state will report the requested narrative information in quarterly and annual monitoring reports (no modifications). 3.Acknowledgement of budget neutrality reporting requirements The state has reviewed the Budget Neutrality Workbook provided by the CMS demonstration team and understands the expectations for quarterly and annual monitoring reports. The state will provide the requested budget neutrality information (no modifications). 4.Retrospective reporting The state is not expected to submit metrics data until after protocol approval, to ensure that data reflects the monitoring plans agreed upon by CMS and the state. Prior to protocol approval, the state should submit quarterly and annual monitoring reports with narrative updates on implementation progress and other information that may be applicable, according to the requirements in its STCs. If a state's monitoring protocol is approved after one or more of its initial quarterly monitoring report submissions, it should report data to CMS retrospectively, for any prior quarters of the section 1115 eligibility and coverage demonstration that precede the monitoring protocol approval date. The state is expected to submit retrospective metrics data \u2014provided there is adequate time for preparation of these data \u2014in its second monitoring report submission that contains metrics. The retrospective report for a state with a first eligibility and coverage demonstration year of less than 12 months, should include data for any baseline period quarters preceding the demonstration, as described in Part A of the state's monitoring protocol. (See Appendix B of the instructions for further guidance determining baseline periods for first eligibility and coverage demonstration years that are less than 12 months.) If a state needs additional time for preparation of these data, it should propose an alternative plan (i.e., specify the monitoring report that would capture the data) for reporting retrospectively on its section 1115 eligibility and coverage demonstration. In the monitoring report submission containing retrospective metrics data, the state should also provide a general assessment of metrics trends from the start of its demonstration through the end of the current reporting period. The state should report this information in Part B of its monitoring report submission (Table 3: Narrative information on implementation, by eligibility and coverage policy). This general assessment is not intended to be a comprehensive description of every trend observed in metrics data. Unlike other monitoring report submissions, for Medicaid Section 1115 Eligibility and Coverage Demonstrations Monitoring Protocol - Part B Version 2.0 Florida Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) 4 instance, the state is not required to describe all metrics changes (+ or -) greater than 2 percent for retrospective reporting periods. Rather, the assessment is an opportunity for the state to provide context on its retrospective metrics data and to support CMS's review and interpretation of these data. For example, consider a state that submits data showing a decrease in beneficiaries who did not complete renewal and were disenrolled from Medicaid (metric AD_19) over the course of the retrospective reporting period. The state could highlight this change and specify that during this period the state conducted additional outreach to beneficiaries about the renewal process. For further information on how to compile and submit a retrospective report, the state should review Section B of the Monitoring Report Instructions document. The state will report retrospectively for any quarters prior to monitoring protocol approval as described above, in the state's second monitoring report submission that contains metrics after protocol approval. The state proposes an alternative plan to report retrospectively for any quarters prior to monitoring protocol approval: Insert narrative description of proposed alternative plan for retrospective reporting. The state should provide justification for its proposed alternative plan. blank Medicaid Section 1115 Eligibility and Coverage Demonstrations Monitoring Protocol (Part A) - Planned metrics (AD) (Version 2.0) State Florida Demonstration Name Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) blank # Metric name Metric description Reporting topicaData source Calculation lagMeasurement periodReporting frequency Reporting priority State will report (Y/N)Baseline reporting period (MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY) Annual goalOverall demonstration targetAttest that planned reporting matches the CMS-provided technical specifications manual (Y/N)Explanation of any deviations from the CMS-provided technical specifications manual (differentdata sources orstate-specific definitions, policies, codes, target populations, etc.)State plans to phase in reporting (Y/N)Report in which metric will be phased in (Format EandC DY and Q; Ex.

For each of the reporting categories listed in columns E and F, select Y or N in the \"Deviation from standard reporting schedule (Y/N)\" column to indicate whether the state plans to report according to the standard reporting schedule. If a state's planned reporting does not match the standard reporting schedule for any quarter and/or reporting category, the state should describe these deviations in the \"Explanation for deviations\" column and use the \"Proposed deviations from standard reporting schedule\" column to indicate the measurement periods with which it wishes to overwrite the standard schedule. All other columns are locked for editing and should not be altered by the state.(1) In the reporting periods input table (Table 1), use the prompt in column A to enter the requested information in the corresponding row of column B. All report names and reporting periods should use the format DY#Q# or CY# and all dates should use the format MM/DD/YYYY with no spaces in the cell. The information entered in these cells will auto-populate the eligibility and coverage demonstration reporting schedule in Table 2. All cells in the input table must be completed in entirety for the standard reporting schedule to be accurately auto-populated.

The auto-generated reporting schedule in Table 2 outlines the data the state is expected to report for each demonstration year and quarter. However, states are not expected to begin reporting any metrics data until after protocol approval. The state should see Section B of the Monitoring Report Instructions for more information on retrospective reporting of data following protocol approval.a Eligibility and coverage demonstration start date: For monitoring purposes, CMS defines the start date of the demonstration as the effective date listed in the state's STCs at the time of eligibility and coverage demonstration approval. For example, if the state's STCs at the time of eligibility and coverage demonstration approval note that the demonstration is effective January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2025, the state should consider January 1, 2020 to be the start date of the demonstration. Note that that the effective date is considered to be the first day the state may begin its eligibility and coverage demonstration. In many cases, the effective date is distinct from the approval date of a demonstration; that is, in certain cases, CMS may approve a section 1115 demonstration with an effective date that is in the future. For example, CMS may approve an extension request on 12/15/2020, with an effective date of 1/1/2021 for the new demonstration period. In many cases, the effective date also differs from the date a state begins implementing its demonstration.

General Background Information 1. Issues Addressed by This Demonstration Under the MMA demonstration, Florida seeks to continue building upon the following objectives that have been fundamental to Florida's Medicaid improvement efforts over the past 15 years: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The demonstration seeks to improve care for Medicaid beneficiaries by providing care through nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top-quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state will provide oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality of care. Improving program performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS] scores), through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care, continuity of care, and continuity of coverage by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care in a timely manner, except those specifically exempted. Increasing access to, stabilizing, and strengthening providers that serve uninsured, low- income populations in the state by targeting LIP funding to reimburse uncompensated care costs for services provided to low-income uninsured patients at hospitals and federally qualified health care centers (FQHC) and rural health clinics (RHC) that are furnished through charity care programs that adhere to the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) principles.1 Improving continuity of coverage and care and encouraging uptake of preventive services, or encouraging individuals to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible, as applicable, as well as promoting the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program, through the waiver of retroactive eligibility. Improving integration of all services, increased care coordination effectiveness, increased individual involvement in their care, improved health outcomes, and reductions in unnecessary or inefficient use of health care. Florida's motivation for improving its Medicaid program stems from two factors: (1) the nationwide concerns about ensuring continued access to high quality care for its Medicaid enrollees while (2) simultaneously addressing the rapid increases in Medicaid costs that have propelled the Medicaid program to the very top of states' budget priorities nationwide. 2.

Description of the Demonstration and History of the Implementation The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Federal CMS) initially approved Florida's 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver, \"Medicaid Reform\", on October 19, 2005. Florida initially implemented the program in Broward and Duval counties on July 1, 2006 and expanded to Baker, Clay, and Nassau counties on July 1, 2007. On June 30, 2010, the Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) submitted a three- year waiver extension request to maintain and continue operations of the Medicaid Reform program. Federal CMS approved the three-year waiver extension request on December 15, 2011 for the period December 16, 2011 through July 31, 2014. On August 1, 2011, Florida submitted an amendment request to Federal CMS to change the name of the demonstration and implement the Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) program as specified in Part IV of Chapter 409, Florida Statutes (F.S.). The amendment allowed the state to implement a new statewide managed care delivery system without increasing costs and to continue the Low-Income Pool (LIP) program. On June 14, 2013, Federal CMS approved the amendment, along with amended Special Terms and Conditions (STCs), waiver and expenditure authorities. MMA program implementation began May 1, 2014 and was fully implemented in all regions by August 2014. On July 31, 2014, CMS approved the State's request for a three-year extension to the MMA 1115 waiver demonstration, along with newly amended STCs and waiver and expenditure authorities, through June 30, 2017. The Agency contracted with the University of Florida (UF) to conduct an independent evaluation of the MMA program. UF subcontracted with two other universities to conduct some components of the evaluation (Florida State University and University of Alabama at Birmingham). The Agency provided the evaluators with a description of the objectives of the MMA program and the approved evaluation design. UF submitted a Final Comprehensive Evaluation Report for DY9 (SFY 2014-15) to the Agency in September 2017. Targeted evaluation questions about the MMA program covered 18 unique domains of focus and were organized into the following five projects: 1. The effect of customized benefit plans and having separate plans for LTC and acute care services on beneficiaries' choice of plans, access to care, quality of care, and cost of care; 2. Healthy Behaviors Programs offered by the MMA plans; 3. MMA program's ability to deter fraud and abuse; 4. The effect of LIP on uncompensated care provided through hospital charity care programs; effect on access, quality and timeliness of care and emergency department usage for the uninsured; and, impact on costs for treating uninsured patients; and, 5. Outcomes for dual-eligible individuals enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan and a MMA plan. Florida's Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program Demonstration Waiver Evaluation Design Update 2021-2030 Prepared by: Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida Department of Behavioral Sciences of Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Florida State University Revised by: Health Services Advisory Group, Inc. 3 The evaluation of the MMA program for DY9 (SFY 2014-15) yielded the following high-level findings: In the MMA period, there were sizable declines in service utilization compared to the pre-MMA period for the following: o Inpatient stays o Outpatient visits o Emergency Department visits o Professional (physician) visits Out of a subset of 26 HEDIS measures, approximately 65 percent (17 measures) of the statewide weighted means improved and 27 percent (7 measures) stayed the same after implementation of MMA. Only 8% (2 measures) declined after implementation. Per member per month (PMPM) costs adjusted for age, race, gender, and Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS) scores (case-mix) for MMA services are 32.9 percent lower for comprehensive plans (serving both LTC and MMA enrollees) compared to PMPM costs for enrollees who are in separate LTC and MMA plans ($206 PMPM comprehensive vs. $306 PMPM separate). While the Florida transition to statewide managed care in 2014 was not without challenges, the overall success in implementing such a broad transformation in the span of a few short months, while reducing per member per month (PMPM) costs and maintaining or improving quality measures, stands as a considerable accomplishment. 4. MMA Program Description and Objectives Federal CMS approved a second extension of the MMA 1115 waiver demonstration (Project No. 11-W-00206/4) for a period of five years beginning August 3, 2017 through June 30, 2022. For the extension, CMS funded the LIP at approximately $1.5 billion annually based on the most recent available data on hospitals' charity care costs to ensure continuing support for safety-net providers that furnish uncompensated care to the Medicaid, uninsured, and underinsured populations. The STCs for the demonstration were modified to simplify and streamline reporting requirements and to remove requirements that are no longer applicable. All future references to the STCs in this document relate to the March 26, 2019 amended STCs unless otherwise indicated. Florida's 1115 demonstration allows the state to operate a capitated Medicaid managed care program. Under the demonstration, most Medicaid eligibles are required to enroll in one of the managed care plans contracted with the State. Several populations may also voluntarily enroll in managed care through the MMA program. The managed care plans in the MMA program are divided into \"standard\" and \"specialty\" plans. Specialty plans serve populations with distinct characteristics, diagnoses or chronic conditions. These plans are tailored to meet the specific needs of the specialty population. Applicants for Medicaid are given the opportunity to select a managed care plan prior to receiving a Florida Medicaid eligibility determination. If they do not choose a plan, they are auto- assigned into a managed care plan upon an affirmative eligibility determination and subsequently provided with information about their choice of plans. Once an enrollee has selected or been assigned an MMA plan, the enrollee shall be enrolled for a total of 12 months, Florida's Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program Demonstration Waiver Evaluation Design Update 2021-2030 Prepared by: Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida Department of Behavioral Sciences of Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Florida State University Revised by: Health Services Advisory Group, Inc. 4 until the next open enrollment period. The 12-month period includes a 120-day period to change or voluntarily disenroll from a plan without cause and select another plan. Managed care plans may provide customized benefits to their members that differ from, but cannot be more restrictive than, the state plan benefits. Participating Medicaid eligibles also have access to Healthy Behaviors programs that provide incentives for adopting healthy behaviors. On November 30, 2018, CMS approved an amendment to the demonstration that allowed the state to operate a statewide Prepaid Dental Health Program, modified the LIP to add Regional Perinatal Intensive Care Centers as an eligible hospital ownership subgroup and community behavioral health providers as a participating provider group, and waived retroactive eligibility for all beneficiaries under the demonstration, except for pregnant women (or during the 60-day period beginning on the last day of the pregnancy), infants under one year of age, or individuals under age 21. On March 26, 2019, CMS approved an amendment to the demonstration to implement a pilot program that provides additional behavioral health services and supportive housing assistance services for persons aged 21 and older with serious mental illness (SMI), substance use disorder (SUD) or SMI with co-occurring SUD, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness due to their disability. The pilot program is operated in two regions of the state: Regions 5 (Pasco and Pinellas counties) and Region 7 (Brevard, Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties). On January 15, 2021, CMS approved an extension of the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot through June 30, 2025. On February 18, 2020, an amendment to the demonstration was approved that enables Florida to increase the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot's annual enrollment limit, modified the LIP's permissible expenditures related to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) and memorialized some budget neutrality-related edits to the behavioral health and supportive housing assistance pilot table in the STCs. Federal CMS approved a third extension of the MMA 1115 waiver demonstration (Project No. 11-W-00206/4) which was effective beginning January 15, 2021 and will be effective through June 30, 2030. 4.1 Populations Covered in the MMA Program MMA program enrollees include individuals eligible under the approved state plan or as a demonstration-only group, and who are described below as \"mandatory enrollees\" or as \"voluntary enrollees.\" Mandatory enrollees are required to enroll in a MMA plan as a condition of receipt of Medicaid benefits.

(These individuals are inmates not eligible for covered services under the state plan, except as inpatients in a medical institution). B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses This section presents each evaluation component and its associated research questions. Note that for research questions focusing on cost and utilization, the pre-MMA period will include recipients enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid in addition to recipients enrolled in Reform and 1915b waiver plans. A driver diagram based on the components and their research questions is included at the end of this section (Figure 1) along with a logic model (Figure 9) for Component 9 that depicts hypothesized causes/effects associated with the changes in Florida's retroactive enrollment policy and a logic model for Component 10 (Figure 10) that depicts hypothesized causes/effects associated with the implementation of a Housing Assistance Pilot for enrollees with serious mental illness and/or substance abuse who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The state of Florida established the MMA program with the goal to improve the quality, access, and costs of care for Florida's Medicaid enrollees. The Agency's specific goal for the managed Florida's Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program Demonstration Waiver Evaluation Design Update 2021-2030 Prepared by: Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida Department of Behavioral Sciences of Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Florida State University Revised by: Health Services Advisory Group, Inc. 10 care plans has been for the plans to reach the National Medicaid 75th percentile on HEDIS measures. The managed care plans' HEDIS rates each year are compared to the previous year National Medicaid percentiles to measure the plans' (and MMA program's) progress toward reaching the 75th percentile. The state's overall goal to improve the quality, access, and costs of care dictates that examining the changes in quality, access, and costs are key to gauging the success of the MMA program. The state therefore seeks a combination of (1) statistically significant beneficial changes in key measures (e.g., cost reductions, access improvements, quality increases) while (2) maintaining performance in those areas where statistically significant beneficial changes are not detected (i.e., not incurring statistically significant cost increases, access reductions, and quality decreases). Given the multitude of measures of cost, access, and quality and the varied populations served by Medicaid, it would be unrealistic to expect across-the-board improvements in every measure of performance for every population. In keeping with the goals of the MMA demonstration, the State expects the demonstration to have an overall positive impact on Florida's efforts to improve its Medicaid program under a capitated managed care program. Hypotheses in this report that describe outcomes as maintaining or improving will be tested using noninferiority testing. Other hypotheses that are stated in null form (i.e., hypothesizing no change) will be tested against a two-tailed alternative hypothesis (i.e., hypothesizing a non-zero, positive or negative change) using 0.05 to denote statistical significance. Hypotheses making a prediction or directional outcome will generally be assessed through qualitative and descriptive data analysis. The Driver Diagram presents the overarching goal of the demonstration and provides readers with a visual aid for understanding the rationale behind the cause and effect of the variants behind the demonstration's aim to improve health outcomes for Florida Medicaid recipients while maintaining fiscal responsibility. As depicted in the diagram, the overall goal is to utilize all financial and stakeholder resources to improve the access and quality of care in a cost-effective manner for Florida Medicaid recipients.

Methodology This evaluation will employ a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods to answer its research questions and test its hypotheses. Quantitative methods will involve pre-post and post-only comparisons depending on whether the research question is focused on (1) comparing Medicaid performance following MMA implementation to Medicaid performance in the pre-MMA period or (2) the operations of the MMA program following implementation, respectively. Qualitative methods will involve (1) surveys and semi-structured interviews of MMA plan personnel and dual-eligible Medicaid enrollees and (2) content analyses of MMA plan policies and procedures. The remainder of this section provides more detail on the (1) evaluation design, (2) target and comparison populations, (3) evaluation period, (4) evaluation measures, (5) data sources, and (6) analytic methods. A useful summary of the methodologies employed in this evaluation can be found in Table 6 \"Design Table for the Evaluation of the Demonstration,\" at the end of this methodology section. Table 6 lists each research question within each component along with the outcome measures, sample or population subgroups to be compared, data sources, and analytic methods used for that research question. Statistical testing for hypotheses that are stated such that the MMA program maintains or improves compared to pre-MMA renewal or out-of-state comparison groups (if available) will be conducted through noninferiority testing. In traditional null hypothesis statistical testing, a result of no significant difference would not necessarily indicate the MMA program maintained rates compared to pre-MMA renewal or an out-of-state group. This is because clinically significant differences could be found statistically insignificant due to low statistical power. Likewise, clinically irrelevant differences could be found to be statistically significant due to large sample sizes. Noninferiority testing is designed to address this limitation by testing directly whether the difference in rates fell within an equivalence interval that denotes the two groups are \"close enough.\"3 A prespecified fraction ( ) of the difference in rates will be used to define an \"equivalence range\" that would conclude MMA members performed as well as the comparison. Where possible, this equivalence range will be informed by clinical 3 Streiner, D.L. (2003) \"Unicorns Do Exist: A Tutorial on 'Proving' the Null Hypothesis,\" Can J Psychiatry, 48(11); Mascha, E. J., and Sessler, D. I., (2011) \"Equivalence and Noninferiority Testing in and Repeated-Measures Designs,\" Analg. Mar;112(3):678-87; Paiggio, Noninferiority and Trials: 2010 Statement\" JAMA. 2012;308(24):2594-2604. Hypothesis 11.2: The MMA eligibility and coverage policies will result in equal or lower Medicaid health services expenditures, provider uncompensated care costs, and combined total costs (administrative, health services, and provider uncompensated care costs. RQ11.2.1: What are the short-term effects of eligibility and coverage policies on Medicaid health service expenditures? RQ11.2.2: What are the long-term effects of eligibility and coverage policies on Medicaid health service expenditures? RQ11.2.3: What are the impacts of eligibility and coverage policies on provider uncompensated care costs? RQ11.2.4: What are the impacts of eligibility and coverage policies on combined total costs (administrative, health services, and provider uncompensated care costs)? Florida's Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program Demonstration Waiver Evaluation Design Update 2021-2030 Prepared by: Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida Department of Behavioral Sciences of Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Florida State University Revised by: Health Services Advisory Group, Inc. 27 guidance. If clinical guidance is not feasible or applicable, will be determined through distribution-based methods such as effect size. While an effect size of 0.20 has commonly been deemed to represent a \"small\" effect as originally suggested by Jacob Cohen, Cohen writes, \"the terms 'small,' 'medium,' and 'large' are relative, not only to each other, but to the area of behavioral science or even more particularly to the specific content and research method being employed in any given investigation\" (p. 25).4 Because the application of effect size in this context is to identify a minimum acceptable difference between proportions while still considering them \"equal\" for practical purposes, a stricter threshold than what may be typically used is appropriate. Therefore, for each measure will be calculated based off an effect size of 0.1. Statistical testing for hypotheses not stated in this manner will use two-tailed significance testing because the direction of change induced by the MMA program is not always clear a priori. Also, evaluation results for DY9 demonstrated that some specific measures (e.g., some categories of costs) may increase while other specific measures may decrease. When changes occur in the opposite direction to what is expected using one-tailed alternative hypotheses, statistical testing can only result in a failure to reject the null hypothesis of zero change. Statistically speaking, this is an inconclusive result. By contrast, two-tailed alternative hypotheses allow rejection of the null hypothesis of zero change in favor of the alternative hypothesis of non-zero change. 1. Evaluation Design This evaluation employs both pre-post and post-only analyses as appropriate for the research question under examination. For example, for Research Question 1.6.1, \"What is the difference in per-enrollee cost by eligibility group pre-MMA implementation (Fee For Service (FFS), Reform plans and pre-MMA 1915(b) waiver plans) compared to per enrollee costs post-MMA implementation (MMA plans as a whole, standard MMA plans and specialty MMA plans)?\", a pre-post perspective is required. The qualitative design is discussed in the context of specific research questions in \"Analytic Methods\" below. 2. Target and Comparison Populations The target and comparison populations vary across the research questions and are driven by (1) the pre-post or post-only focus of the research question, and (2) the specific population focus of the research question, e.g., enrollees in standard MMA plans vs. enrollees in specialty MMA plans. Where the data allow, measures and analyses will be stratified by race/ethnicity and geography to identify any disparate impacts of the demonstration. The population foci of individual research questions are listed in Table 6 below. 3. Evaluation Period The current evaluation period began with SFY 2020-21 (DY15) and extends through SFY 2029-30 (DY24). The table below details the evaluation period that will be covered in each deliverable for the current demonstration approval period. 4 Cohen, J.

Determination of the final analytic method in each report and for each measure will be determined upon receipt of data to assess the quality, frequency, and availability of data, each of which will influence the analytic method. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 in evaluation periods may influence the analytic method. Generally, analyses that utilize an interrupted time series will likely not be able to be conducted until the DY 15-19 and DY 15-22 interim reports and the summative report since it is expected that there will likely be too few data points for a robust interrupted time series analysis. The synthetic control method, which depending largely on the availability of T-MSIS data, will likely not be viable until the summative report, due to the two-to-three-year lag in data availability. The next-best rigorous analytic approach will be used in lieu of the interrupted time series and synthetic controls. 4. Evaluation Measures This evaluation uses a wide variety of measures of quality, access, and costs.

Data Sources This evaluation will collect both quantitative and qualitative data from a variety of sources as outlined below in Table 5, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Data Sources for Florida MMA Evaluation\". Quantitative data will be collected predominantly from secondary sources (e.g., claims and encounter data, HEDIS performance reports, state MCO performance reports, etc.). The sole exception involving collecting primary quantitative data will involve collecting dual- eligible care coordination experiences via telephone surveys using closed-end questions. Qualitative data will be collected using both semi-structured interviews and review of policies and procedures documents. Fully coded transcriptions of qualitative interviews will be Florida's Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Program Demonstration Waiver Evaluation Design Update 2021-2030 Prepared by: Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida Department of Behavioral Sciences of Social Medicine, College of Medicine, Florida State University Revised by: Health Services Advisory Group, Inc. 42 analyzed through iterations of content analysis and grounded theory to identify salient themes. The cleaning of Medicaid eligibility, enrollment, encounter, and claims data is done by both the Agency and the evaluation team. The eligibility, enrollment, encounter, and claims data used in his evaluation comes from the Agency's Decision Support System (DSS) database. The evaluation team conducts numerous checks related to data integrity upon receipt of the DSS data. \"Filler\" codes for character variables are checked (e.g., \"####\" or \"****\") and detected filler values are set to missing. Range-checking for both numeric and character variables as well as logical consistency checks are made among age, sex, diagnosis and procedure codes. Missingness rates are calculated for each variable in each dataset and compared to missingness rates in previous years of similar data. Voided claims (detail status = V) are removed, as are preliminary records that have been superseded by subsequent revised entries. Duplicate records are deleted to eliminate redundant encounter records resulting from multiple submissions from providers. These additional checks routinely produce questions from the evaluation team for the Agency data team concerning errors and anomalies. Answers given by the Agency data team are documented for future reference. Questions that cannot be readily answered are resolved by the involvement of additional data personnel and/or the transmittal of corrected data as needed. The HEDIS and CAHPS data used in this evaluation are independently audited prior to being submitted to the Agency. Similarly, Florida hospital discharge, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery center data are cleaned and error-checked by the Florida Health Data Center upon receipt.

Analytic Methods This evaluation will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods in answering the research questions outlined above. The quantitative methods will include both simple descriptive methods and multivariable statistical methods while the qualitative methods will include analysis of structured administrative interview data and thematic analyses of semi-structured interview data (using content analyses and grounded theory). The remainder of this section describes these methods in greater detail. Table 6 following these descriptions lists each research question along with the associated analytic method to be used in answering that question. Overall Analytic Design Issues Pre-post comparisons have well-known limitations concerning the influence of intervening factors beyond the intervention under study that can bias the observed treatment effect. Similarly, post-only comparisons face the challenge of unobserved heterogeneity between the treatment and comparison groups that influence both outcomes and selection into the treatment vs. comparison groups. Unfortunately, strong evaluation designs that address the limitations of pre-post and post- only designs such as difference-in-differences and propensity-score matching are not viable for evaluating Florida's MMA program. The exceptions where this approach may be used include selected questions in (1) the Housing Assistance Pilot (Component 10) and (2) the impact of Florida's retroactive enrollment policy change on new enrollee financial burden (Component 9). These stronger evaluation designs are not viable for much of the MMA program primarily due to the fact that Florida's statewide transition to the MMA program took place over a three-month period5 and included over 90 percent of Florida's Medicaid enrollees. This poses special challenges for employing evaluation designs such as difference-in-differences and propensity-score matching since no suitable comparison groups were available within Florida Medicaid following MMA implementation. Comparison groups outside of Florida Medicaid provide the next-best approach for establishing causal inferences. Where possible, out-of-state data will be used to serve as comparison groups. While an out-of-state comparison group can provide a counterfactual design, the granularity of the data available may not allow for strong statistical controls over differences across the populations. Additionally, it is unlikely the independent evaluator will be able to control for additional quality improvement programs that may impact a comparison group population. 5 This three-month period covered virtually the full transition to the MMA program, although one MMA plan (Freedom) began operations in January 2015. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 49 Out-of-State Comparison Groups Identifying Comparison States The selection of states used for an out-of-state comparison group will be based on similarities to Florida Medicaid members in terms of overall demographics as well as state Medicaid programs and policies. In addition, comparison states should not have a major change in Medicaid policies during either the baseline or evaluation periods. Selection of states will be conducted on a measure-by-measure basis depending on available data. The independent evaluator will assess the feasibility of utilizing out-of-state comparison groups based on the criteria for identifying comparison states and data availability. The menu of analytic methods generally depends on two factors related to availability of data: 1) Level of data granularity 2) Number of time periods prior to intervention Level of Data Granularity Beneficiary-Level Data Data at the beneficiary-level would allow for a selection of individuals who are similar to MMA beneficiaries which would serve as a comparison group. This would provide the most flexibility in identifying a suitable comparison group for a wide selection of measures. Such data may be obtained through the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T- MSIS) Analytic Files (TAF). Due to the two-to-three year lag, with only preliminary data for 2020 available as of this writing, the T-MSIS data is expected to be feasible for only the summative evaluation report. Depending on access fees and the restrictions around using the T-MSIS data, the independent evaluator will determine the most cost-effective and feasible approach for developing a comparison group. With beneficiary-level data supplied through T-MSIS, the independent evaluator expects to be able to apply individual level propensity scoring adjustments.6 Moreover, with access to beneficiary-level Medicaid data, the independent evaluator can calculate rates for customized or non-standardized measures as opposed to relying on aggregate data for established quality metrics. Aggregate Data If beneficiary-level data are not available or are not cost-effective, established quality metrics such as measures that follow CMS Core Set specifications can utilize aggregate data in the form of benchmark information or data from out-of-state health plans. The level of granularity of the benchmark data and available time periods will dictate the type of statistical testing possible. For instance, some methods such as difference-in-differences require distributional measures of the data such as standard deviation or variance, and/or sample sizes. If these data are not available, it will not be possible to calculate the standard errors necessary for making statistical inferences. It is possible, however, to implement other methods such as interrupted time series or synthetic controls with aggregated rate data, but as described 6 Bradley, K., J. Heeringa, R.V. Pohl, J.D. Reschovsky, and M. Samra. \"Selecting the Best Comparison Group and Evaluation Design: A Guidance Document for State Section 1115 Demonstration Evaluations.\" Washington, DC: Mathematica, revised October 2020. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 50 below, require sufficient number of data points prior to intervention. Pre-Intervention Data Availability If the source of out of state data are limited to few data points prior to implementation, then the independent evaluator will apply a difference-in-differences approach, which can be conducted on as little as one baseline data point.7 If additional but limited data points are available (for example between 3 and 6 data points), then the independent evaluator will explore either an interrupted time series approach with comparison group(s) or synthetic controls. With additional data points, the likelihood of successfully applying the synthetic control methods increases. Certain components of the evaluation, however, may be able to utilize an in-state comparison group. For example, because there are limits to the number of enrollees who can participate in the Housing Assistance Pilot, individuals who are placed on a waiting list for the program may serve as controls, which may allow for standard and/or modified difference-in- differences analysis of the Housing Assistance Pilot. While there are no members on the waitlist at time of writing, this approach may be used for late interim reports or the summative report if the program has reached its capacity and there are individuals on the waitlist. Furthermore, evaluating the impact of Florida's retroactive enrollment policy change on new enrollee financial burden poses special challenges to traditional pre-post and post-only research designs. The large number of new Florida Medicaid enrollees each month will likely convey sufficient statistical power to detect even minute differences across groups in financial burden as statistically significant. In addition, because financial burden can change due to a myriad of factors beyond unpaid medical bills (e.g., job loss, unexpected financial losses, and non-health family emergencies), the potential for intervening time factors to create history bias is very high. For these reasons, we are proposing to use modified difference-in-differences designs to assess new enrollee financial burden associated with the February 2019 retroactive enrollment policy change. The modified difference-in-differences designs relax the stringent parallel time trends assumption of standard difference-in-differences designs. These designs are discussed in detail in Attachment 6 of this document. The remainder of the MMA evaluation questions will employ the best approach given constraints on available data and/or as dictated by the research question under study. In general, a pre-post perspective (e.g., ITS with or without comparison group, difference-in- differences, or synthetic controls) will be used when the focus is on the overall impact of the MMA intervention on costs and utilization. A post- only perspective will be used when the research question is focused on some aspect of the MMA program operation, such as separate vs. comprehensive MMA and LTC service organization. Multivariable statistical models, including propensity scoring adjustments, will be used whenever feasible to control for other factors that might influence the outcome. Propensity Score Matching Propensity score matching will be used to identify a subset of the eligible comparison group that is most similar to the intervention population based on observable characteristics, 7 Pohl, K. R., and Bradley, K. \"Selection of Out-of-State Comparison Groups and the Synthetic Control Method.\" Washington, DC: Mathematica, October 2020. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 51 including demographic factors and health conditions prior to implementation of the demonstration. 8 Propensity score matching has been used extensively to match individuals from an eligible comparison group to individuals in the intervention group. 9 However, there are several risks to the use of propensity scores and subsequent matching on the propensity score . Propensity Score Risks Risk Description Insufficient coverage Not enough individuals in the eligible comparison group similar enough to intervention population for 1:1 matching Unbalanced groups Observable characteristics of the intervention and comparison groups after matching are not balanced When confronted with insufficient coverage, the independent evaluator will first explore alternative specifications in either the propensity score model and/or the matching algorithm before moving to alternative approaches. For example, instead of a typical 1:1 greedy matching algorithm, the independent evaluator will explore matching with replacement or optimal matching algorithms.10 If alternative matching algorithms do not yield a matched comparison group with sufficient coverage and balance, then propensity score weighting will be explored as the next step. Propensity score weighting utilizes the full eligible comparison group and assigns a higher statistical weight to beneficiaries who are predicted to be part of the intervention but were not. A risk of this methodology is that the analysis may be dominated by a handful of beneficiaries with extremely high weights. Balance between the matched comparison and intervention groups will be assessed using a three-pronged approach to evaluate the similarity between the intervention group and comparison groups across observable characteristics, or covariates. The Error! Reference source not found. summarizes each of the three prongs. Assessment Approaches Assessment Approach Advantage Cautionary Note Covariate-level statistical testing Provides quantitative evidence, or lack thereof, of significant differences between matched groups Susceptible to false positives for large sample sizes and false negatives for small sample sizes Standardized differences Does not rely on sample size No universal threshold to indicate balance or unbalance Omnibus test Provides a single quantitative assessment of balance across all covariates as a whole Susceptible to false positives for large sample sizes and false negatives for small sample sizes Each of these approaches ultimately assesses the similarity of the mean of the distribution for each covariate. Additional metrics pertaining to the distribution should also be considered as part of the balance assessment, such as reporting the standard deviations.11 8 See, e.g., Selecting the Best Comparison Group and Evaluation Design: A Guidance Document for State Section 1115 Demonstration Evaluations\" for a detailed discussion of appropriate evaluation designs based on comparison group strategies (https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demo/downloads/evaluation-reports/comparison-grp-evaldsgn.pdf). 9 Guo, S., and Fraser, M.W., (2010) Propensity Score Analysis: Statistical Methods and Applications, SAGE Publications, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA; or Austin, P.

An Introduction to Propensity Score Methods for Reducing the Effects of Confounding in Observational SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 52 These categories represent a starting place for building the comparison group and may not reflect the final selection identified by the independent evaluator. Similarities in observable characteristics between the intervention population and those meeting exemptions will be assessed and if systematic differences are found, propensity score matching, or weighting, will be used to normalize the comparison group to match the intervention group. Identifying and Accounting for Impacts of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency The COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) impacted Medicaid programs, enrollment, utilization patterns, state expenditure patterns in unprecedented ways in terms of scope, magnitude, and duration. The resulting impacts, particularly for CY 2020, generally dominate any programmatic impacts, particularly for program elements that may have been scheduled for implementation during the PHE. Separating PHE and demonstration effect is particularly challenging for this evaluation since DY 15-17 (the years most impacted by the PHE) primarily represent continuations of previous programmatic elements. Impacts from the PHE vary by state, but generally , CY 2019 and early Q1 2020 represent negligible or very small PHE impacts. Beginning in late Q1 and through Q2 of 2020, the data reflect the maximum impact resulting from the PHE and the PHE effects dominate most demonstration waiver program impacts, particularly for demonstrations, such as this, where few if any programmatic changes were implemented during this period. Beginning in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, the PHE impact diminished but remained significant. During this period, PHE impacts can still dominate program effects, but the exact trajectory of the PHE impact, including its degree of persistence over time are not currently well understood, particularly with regional variations in subsequent spikes in COVID cases and the emergence of COVID variant strains. Beginning in CY 2021 fewer PHE impacts are generally observed; however, as with the previous period, the exact trajectory of the PHE impacts, including their degree of persistence and the effects of subsequent infection rate spikes and COVID variants may still drive significant impacts that could be confounded with or mistaken for demonstration effects, such as an increase in utilization resulting from pent-up demand for services. Additionally, the PHE has resulted in fundamental changes across a wide range of health care, including the widespread adoption and availability of telehealth services; changes which may not be the result of a demonstration. The independent evaluator will employ a range of approaches to adjust or account for PHE impacts throughout the course of the evaluation. The specific approach used for a given measure will depend on several factors that will not be known until the evaluation activities covered by this design are underway. Some of these factors include: The quality and availability of data pertaining to specific measures in the evaluation design and the appropriateness of the data for the PHE adjustment method; The availability and reliability of PHE-related data such as COVID infection rates as well as measures of hospital and emergency department capacity; and, The availability and quality of multiple-state data covering a sufficient baseline period Studies. Multivariate behavioral , 46(3), 399-424. doi:10.1080/00273171.2011.568786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144483/. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 53 through at least CY 2021. Once the data have been collected, validated, and reviewed, the independent evaluator will determine and employ the most rigorous method based on the content of the measure, any observable PHE impacts, and available data. A brief overview of the range of methods that may be implemented are described below, ranging from the least to the most complex/rigorous. Dropping observations for periods in which the PHE impacts dominate demonstration effects to such a degree that no method can reliably or accurately separate demonstration effects from the PHE impacts. Adjust baseline periods, where appropriate, from pre-PHE period to a post CY 2020 period, ensuring that demonstration effects are measured and tested against a baseline period that more accurately reflects the post-PHE changes in the provision and utilization of health care. Restrict the analyses to beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid before the PHE through the evaluation period. Implement case mix (or risk) adjustments across the entire PHE trajectory to account for variations in Medicaid enrollment resulting from the PHE. Develop a composite measure of PHE impact based on available measures of \"COVID intensity\", such as COVID case rates, including variations over time and across geographic regions. This will allow for a proxy measure of the PHE impact across time and geographic regions. Employ an event study method, estimating impacts for each year in the demonstration rather than across the entire duration of the demonstration. Estimate alternative counterfactuals, using interrupted time series. Leverage multiple-state data, such as T-MSIS, combined with time-series data and geographic measures of PHE intensity, such as COVID infection rates, measures of hospital/ED capacity, and other relevant PHE policies across several comparison state to develop a high frequency (e.g., quarterly or monthly) estimate of the PHE impact trajectory over demonstration years possibly impacted by the PHE. In conjunction with a multiple-state control/comparison group, this approach would allow the independent evaluator to estimate a PHE-only counterfactual against which to test the presence and magnitude of demonstration effects. Each approach has unique strengths and weaknesses that will vary by measure, data source, and the degree of the PHE impact. The independent evaluator will provide a complete description of the methods used as well as a justification for its use across all measures included in the evaluation. Additionally, the independent evaluator will conduct sensitivity analyses across all measures and methods used to separate PHE and demonstration effects to determine the extent to which the particular PHE adjustment may have changed the outcome of the measure Statistical Testing and Modeling The independent evaluator will utilize the best analytic approach given the type of measure, research question, and available data. Multivariable statistical models, including propensity score matching, will be used when analyzing individual enrollee encounter cost and utilization data to control for factors that influence costs and utilization and isolate the effect of the characteristic under study (e.g., the MMA intervention and separate vs. comprehensive MMA and LTC services). SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 54 Synthetic Control Method If data are available from a large number of other states and for sufficient number of pre- intervention time periods, the independent evaluator will first seek to implement the synthetic control method prior to conducting alternative analyses. This method, as described in CMS' guidance on Section 1115 demonstration evaluations, \"involves constructing a single comparison group from a pool of potential comparison states (the \"donor pool\") by combining them so that the newly constructed (synthetic) comparison group resembles the treatment group as closely as possible on levels and trends in preintervention outcomes.\"12 Although this approach is the most restrictive in terms of requiring the most number of comparison states and pre-intervention data points, it is flexible in terms of level of data necessary. For example, if the independent evaluator cannot obtain beneficiary-level data or measures of uncertainty in aggregate data are not available, aggregate data in the form of statewide or plan-level rates may still be used. Interrupted Time Series When a suitable comparison group cannot be found and data can be collected at multiple points in time before and after the implementation of the program, an ITS methodology can be used. This analysis is quasi-experimental in design and will compare a trend in outcomes between the baseline period and the evaluation period for those who were subject to the program. In ITS, the measurements taken before the demonstration will be used to predict the outcome as if the demonstration did not occur. The measurements collected after the demonstration are then compared to the predicted outcome to evaluate the impact the demonstration had on the outcome. The ITS model is: =+ + + \u00d7+ where Yt is the outcome of interest for the time period t, time represents a linear time trend, post is a dummy variable to indicate the time periods post-implementation, and time\u00d7post is the interaction term between time and post. The coefficient, 0, identifies the starting level of outcome Y, 1 is the slope of the outcome between the measurements before the program, 2 is the change in the outcome at a various point in time, and 3 is the change in the slope for the measurements after the program. Assuming that the measurements taken after the implementation of the demonstration would have been equal to the expectation predicted from the measurements taken before the demonstration in the absence of the intervention, any changes in the observed rates after implementation can be attributed to the program. A limitation of interrupted time series is the need for sufficient data points both before and after program implementation.13 To facilitate this methodology, the independent evaluator may consider additional baseline data points using prior year calculations, and/or calculating quarterly rates where feasible, if multiple years both pre-and post-implementation are 12 Pohl, K. R., and Bradley, K. \"Selection of Out-of-State Comparison Groups and the Synthetic Control Method.\" Washington, DC: Mathematica, October 2020. 13 Baicker, K., and Svoronos, T., (2019) \"Testing the Validity of the Single Interrupted Time Series Design,\" Working (2017) \"Interrupted series regression for the evaluation of public health interventions: a tutorial,\" International Journal of Epidemiology, 46(1): 348-355, https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyw098; Penfold, R.

SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 55 available to control for seasonality in quarterly data. If out-of-state data are available, a variation of the ITS approach to include a comparison group can be implemented.14 Comparison to National Benchmarks The independent evaluator will compare rates using statistical testing (e.g., chi-square, t- tests) for established quality metrics to national benchmarks or national surveys where available but cannot implement more robust methods such as interrupted time series, synthetic controls, or DiD. Medicaid Expenditures The impact of factor under study (e.g., the MMA program) will be assessed using a two-part mixture model which first assesses the odds of having any expenditure or use using a random effects logit model (Equation 1) that accounts for clustering by month and by individual, and then uses a random effects log-linear generalized least squares regression (Equation 2) that also accounted for clustering by month and by individual. Both models assess the impact of the MMA program by including an indicator for whether or not the observation was from an individual enrolled in an MMA plan during the MMA study period. This shows the shift in the intercept associated with the MMA program (i.e., the average difference in PMPM expenditures or use between the pre-MMA and MMA periods). The two equations estimated used the following specifications: given month, while ln (PMPM $) is the natural log of expenditures by an individual in any given month given that they incurred any expenditures. ( $ = 1) ln (( $ = 0)) = 1 + Age 2 + Gender 3 + Race 4 + RiskScore 5 + it ln( $) = 1 + Age 2 + Gender 3 + Race 4 + RiskScore 5 + it To obtain an estimate of the likely difference in expenditures due to the MMA program, average PMPM expenditures were predicted assuming all enrollees continued in the pre-MMA program using the multivariate models, and then average PMPM expenditures were calculated again to determine what PMPM expenditures would have been if the trend in expenditures had instead followed the trend observed in the MMA program. The multivariate model specifications for the comparison of pre-MMA to specialty MMA plans and pre-MMA to standard MMA plans was essentially the same except only observations from specialty MMA plan enrollees were used to assess expenditures during the MMA period for the specialty MMA analysis while only observations from standard MMA plan enrollees during the MMA period were used for the standard MMA plan analysis. As discussed above, the multivariate model comparing service utilization associated with participation in the Housing Assistance Pilot will use a standard or modified difference-in- difference approach, where changes in utilization from the year prior to implementation of the Pilot to utilization in the year after implementation for participating enrollees will be compared to changes in utilization over the same time period for enrollees who were placed on the waiting list for participation in the Housing Assistance Pilot.

Qualitative Analyses Qualitative research questions in this evaluation are found in Components 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, and 10: - RQ 1.4.3 : What strategies are standard MMA and specialty MMA plans using to improve quality of care? - RQ 1.4.4 : Which of the strategies used by standard MMA and specialty MMA plans are most effective in improving quality and why? RQ 2.1.5 : How do enrollees rate their experience and satisfaction with the expanded benefits that are offered by their health plan? - RQ 6.1.4 : What specific care coordination strategies and practices are most effective for ensuring access to and quality of care for behavioral health services for dual-eligible enrollees? - RQ 6.1.5: What specific care coordination strategies and practices are most effective for ensuring access to and quality of care for non-emergency transportation services for dual-eligible enrollees? - RQ 6.1.6: How do dual-eligible enrollees rate their experience and satisfaction with the delivery of care they receive related to behavioral health services? - RQ 6.1.7 : How do dual-eligible enrollees rate their experience and satisfaction with the delivery of care they receive related to non-emergency transportation services? - RQ 8.4.3 : How do enrollees rate their experiences and satisfaction with the expanded benefits offered by their dental health plans? - RQ 9.1.1 : How will eliminating retroactive eligibility change enrollment continuity? - RQ 9.2.1: Do beneficiaries subject to the retroactive eligibility waiver understand that they will not be covered during enrollment gaps? - RQ 9.3.1: What are common barriers to timely renewal for those subject to the retroactive eligibility waiver? - RQ 10.1.4 : How did MMA plans implement the Pilot program? - RQ 10.1.8 : Is care coordination more effective for the study population as a result of the Housing Assistance Pilot Program? - RQ 11.1.1: What are the administrative costs incurred by the state to implement and operate the demonstration? - RQ 11.2.3: What are the impacts of eligibility and coverage policies on provider uncompensated care costs? SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 57 Methods Qualitative interviews with MMA plan experts. Experts in quality of care (RQs 1.4.3, 1.4.4), care 10.1.4) at each of the MMA plans will be identified to participate in in-depth interviews. Each plan's contract manager will assist the investigators in identifying and contacting the appropriate experts. Identified experts will receive an introductory email that includes: the purpose of the study, contact information of qualitative team personnel who can answer questions about the study or the request and assist with any technical issues. In addition, the email will notify experts that we would like to schedule a 30- to 60-minute telephone interview with them. To assist the evaluation team in preparing for the interview, the introductory email will include a form-fillable PDF document with preliminary questions addressing the topics to be covered in the interviews (described below). The MMA plan experts will be asked to prepare written responses to these questions and email the completed PDF form to the study team prior to their scheduled interview. The research teams will develop qualitative interview guides with a list of questions relevant to Research Questions all MMA plans for RQs 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 5.1.4 and6.1.5, and for MMA plans Housing Pilot for 10.1.1, 10.1.2, 10.1.3, 10.1.4 and 10.1.8. All data collection tools will be reviewed by the Agency prior to administration. The interview guides will include questions for plans that also participate in the LTC program to address the role LTC case managers (6.1.4, 6.1.5) have in addressing the respective topics. Before each MMA plan's scheduled telephone interview, the research teams will review: (1) the MMA plan's updated Policy and Procedure document(s) provided by the Agency related to quality of care and performance improvement (1.4.3, 1.4.4) or coordination of behavioral health services and non- emergency transportation services (6.1.4, 6.1.5); and (2) the MMA plan's written responses to the preliminary questions in PDF format. These reviews may generate follow-up questions and points of clarification tailored to each specific health plan, which will be added to the plan's telephone interview guide prior to the plan's scheduled interview. They also will help to streamline the interview process and minimize respondent burden. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted with the same experts who were initially contacted and who provided the written PDF responses, or appropriate delegated individuals who are knowledgeable in the areas of interest. In addition, participants may include other health plan experts in the interviews. Interviews will follow a qualitative, semi-structured format. Interviews will be conducted by trained qualitative interviewers by telephone (lasting 30 to 60 minutes), audio recorded and transcribed for coding and analysis. The qualitative team that comprises researchers from UF, UAB and FSU will administer the interviews that are specific to their component areas. Qualitative interview analysis. Qualitative research teams will use Atlas.ti (V8) or Nvivo to analyze interview transcripts produced for research questions 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 6.1.3, following iterations of content analysis and grounded theory. For each research question, an initial codebook of priori themes will be developed based on the interview guide. Coding of transcripts will be conducted concurrently with data collection and reviewed in team meetings to ensure inter-rater reliability. Following grounded theory methods, reviewers will define codes for new themes that emerge in the analysis; as new codes are produced, the codebook will be updated and previously-coded transcripts will be back-coded to capture SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 58 the new themes. After all MMA plan interviews have been completed and their transcripts coded, the research teams will conduct a content analysis to determine the most common themes and relevant co-occurrences among the themes. Based on findings of the content analysis, the research teams will conduct targeted queries to identify patterns in responses and exemplary quotes. Member surveys. The research teams will design structured telephone surveys to be administered to MMA plan members, addressing experiences and satisfaction with expanded health plan benefits (2.1.5), coordination of behavioral health and non-emergency transportation for dual-eligible members (6.1.6, 6.1.7), expanded benefits offered by prepaid dental health plans (8.4.3), new enrollee health status (9.1.2), enrollee understanding of retroactive enrollment changes and barriers to enrollment renewal (9.2.1and 9.3.1), and enrollee experiences with whether their services needs were met, integration of services, involvement in care, and satisfaction with services provided through the Housing Pilot program (10.1.9). The surveys will be administered to MMA and prepaid dental plan members (2.1.5, 8.4.3), dual-eligible MMA plan members (5.1.6, 6.1.7) who were enrolled in an MMA standard or MMA specialty plan in the last 12 months, MMA new enrollees (9.1.2), MMA enrollees subject to the new retroactive enrollment policy (9.2.1 and 9.3.1), and plan members who participated in the Housing Assistance Pilot (10.1.9). Sources of survey questions are specific to the research questions and described in the sections below. Additional questions may be developed by the research teams upon written approval of the Agency. Telephone surveys will be conducted by trained interviewers by phone. Participants will have the option to complete the surveys in English or Spanish. Telephone survey data will be analyzed by the research teams using SPSS V23, SAS, or Stata. Four measures utilize CAHPS beneficiary surveys. The independent evaluator will use existing and/or historic CAHPS data administered by health plans in the analysis of these measures, depending on data availability. As these surveys have already been fielded and the data already exist, the independent evaluator will have limited influence over the sample sizes of these surveys. These previously administered CAHPS surveys (as well as future surveys) have followed (and will follow) the standard National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae) Specifications for Survey Measures, which requires a sample size of 1,350 beneficiaries for the CAHPS 5.0 Adult Medicaid Health Plan Survey and 1,650 for the CAHPS 5.0 Child Medicaid Health Plan Survey15,16. For the measures that rely on customized survey questions, a separate power calculation was conducted to determine the required sample sizes to assess various effect sizes; we chose to compare a 3 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent proportional difference, which corresponds to 1.5, 2.5, and 5 percentage point change from 50 percent, respectively. Using a standard power level of 0.80, an alpha level of 0.05 and a two-sided test, we calculated the required sample sizes using both a chi-square test and z-test for difference in proportions.

HEDIS\u00ae 2021, Volume 3: Specifications for Survey Measures . Washington, DC: NCQA Publication, 2021. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 59 Proportion Difference Chi-square n Z-test n 0.05 1,565 1,566 A sample size that is powered to detect a proportional difference of 5 percent, a value that is appropriate given the proposed measures is ideal. However, this would require a total number of surveys of 41,861 (6,276 * 6.67), assuming a 15 percent response rate. However, since budgetary constraints are a concern, then 10,446 (1,566 * 6.67) total surveys will likely be used to detect a 10 percent proportional difference. The State and its independent evaluator will seek to streamline survey administration across evaluations to minimize the number of separate survey rounds required, thereby minimizing the burden on beneficiaries and maximizing the response rate. Provider surveys. It is expected that FHURS and HCRIS data will be available and sufficient to investigate RQ 11.2.3. However, provider surveys may be administered to answer RQ 11.2.3, if FHURS and/or HCRIS data are not available or do not sufficiently address the research question. In that event, provider surveys will be developed by the independent evaluator and power calculations provided in the interim and summative reports. Qualitative issues and approaches for specific questions. Research Questions 1.4.3 and 1.4.4 In addition to plan document reviews and interviews with plan experts, this component will review the 2015-2016 Florida Annual Performance Improvement Project Validation Summary Report produced by the Health Services Advisory Group to identify specific performance improvement projects (PIPs) offered by health plans. During the in-depth interviews, experts will be specifically asked about their own performance improvement projects, including associated indicator rates. In addition, during the in-depth interviews experts will be asked to comment on which projects are most effective at improving quality and why they are effective. Research Question 2.1.5 A random sample of MMA enrollees who used at least one expanded benefit during the previous 12 months will be included in this study. Research Questions 6.1.6, 6.1.7, and 10.1.8 Experts in care coordination at the MMA and MMA specialty plans will include individuals at all 11 MMA standard plans and 4 of the MMA specialty plans. Among the MMA standard plans, Amerigroup, Better Health, and Simply are owned by the same parent company (Anthem) and share the same policies and procedures; these three plans will therefore be considered as a single unit for analysis (i.e., only one \"Anthem\" interview will be conducted, covering Amerigroup, Better Health, and Simply). Among the six MMA specialty plans, two will be excluded because they are specific to children and do not cover the dual-eligible population of interest in this study (Children's Medical Services and Sunshine Child Welfare). The remaining four MMA specialty plans (Clear Health Alliance, Freedom Health, Magellan Complete Care, and Positive Health) will be included in this study. A total of 13 health plan units will be included in the analysis. Research Questions 1.5.6 and 1.5.7 A stratified random sample of dual-eligible survey respondents will be selected from the populations of adult dual-eligible enrollees (18+ years) who were continuously enrolled in the SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 60 same MMA standard plan (Group 1) or MMA specialty plan (Group 2) during the 12 months prior to sampling. The survey tool to be administered for research questions 1.5.6 and 1.5.7 may include: (1) items from the CAHPS Health Plan Survey for Medicaid, Version 4.0 supplemental set addressing health plan transportation, (2) the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey - a validated survey tool from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that assesses experiences with behavioral health care, (3) other questions on non- emergency transportation provided in correspondence with AHCA, and (4) questions from the Medicare Health Beneficiary Survey to collect information on self-reported health and functional status for dual-eligible members. The survey will have the option to be completed by sampled members or (in cases where the member is physically or mentally unable to participate) by proxy respondents (such as family members) who are familiar with the member's health and health care. Research Question 8.4.3 Sampling and other survey methods specific to RQ 8.4.3 will likely be similar to those used for RQs 2.1.5, 1.5.6 and 1.5.7and will be determined after more information on the operation and utilization rates of the prepaid dental health program becomes available. Research Question 9.1.1 RQ 9A proposes to survey hospital and nursing facilities to determine their changes in enrollment application procedures following or in anticipation of the change in retroactive enrollment policy. Sampling and other survey methods for RQ 8.1.1 will likely be similar to those used for RQs 1.4.3 and 1.4.4. Research Question 9.1.2 RQ 9.1.2will survey new MMA enrollees to measure their health status. Note: The lack of new enrollee health status data prior to the change in retroactive enrollment policy may limit the ability to conduct analyses of these data. Research Question 9.2.1 RQ 9.2.1 examines enrollee understanding of the change in retroactive enrollment policy and the implications of this change for Medicaid coverage during enrollment gaps. The survey sampling frame for RQ 9.2.1 will include men and non-pregnant women as the population most likely to be impacted by the policy change. Both new and existing enrollees will be chosen at random for the survey since the retroactive policy change applies to both groups. Research Question 9.3.1 RQ 9.3.1 examines enrollee perceptions of common barriers to timely renewal of Medicaid coverage following the change in retroactive enrollment policy. The survey sampling frame and inclusion criteria for RQ 9.3.1 will be the same as for examine how participating MMA plans implemented the Housing Assistance Pilot. MMA plan staff with knowledge of the Pilot implementation process will be identified and administered qualitative surveys to assess steps used to implement the Pilot. Research Question 10.1.8 RQ 10.1.8 examines whether care coordination is more effective for the study population as a result of the Housing Pilot program. Care coordinators at each participating MMA plan will SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 61 be selected to participate in qualitative surveys. Questions will address how plans measure care coordination and to identify relevant outcomes being measured by plans. This information will be subsequently used to assess the association of care coordination activities with relevant study outcomes using quantitative methods. Research Question 11.1.1 Research Question 11.1.1 examines administrative costs incurred by the state to implement and operate the demonstration. Qualitative interviews will systematically gather information on administrative costs, particularly for understanding the allocation of state staff time required to launch and then maintain demonstration operations. They state may also conduct data collection through interviews and secondary sources on managed care administrative costs. Research Question 11.2.3 Research Question 11.2.3 examines the impacts of eligibility and coverage policies on provider uncompensated care costs. The state-specific provider survey, will provide information about uncompensated care costs incurred by hospital and nonhospital providers, such as federally qualified health centers. The state will field surveys at baseline to understand changes after demonstration implementation. Table 6.

D. Methodological Limitations Limitations of the evaluation include the design, the data sources or collection process, analytic methods and the state's efforts to minimize the limitations. Additionally, this section includes information about features of the demonstration that effectively present methodological constraints the state would like CMS to consider in its review. Current and subsequent years will continue to show that the MMA demonstration remains non-complex and mostly unchanged; therefore, evaluation results may be limited in providing additional or divergent findings from prior evaluations. In addition, the MMA program continues to operate smoothly without administration changes, with minimal appeals and grievances, and with no known issues with CMS 64 reporting or budget neutrality. Consequently, the new STCs were modified to simplify and streamline the state's reporting requirements to CMS, moving from quarterly to annual reporting. In addition, monthly calls with CMS are now on a periodic basis as the need is determined. Individual level Healthy Behaviors data were available beginning with the evaluation of DY13. However, the lack of individual level Healthy Behaviors data for the evaluations of DY10, DY11 and DY12 was a limitation because service utilization patterns will not be known for specific enrollees. For example, it was not possible to know if participation in the program results in more appropriate use of services if the ability to link to individual enrollment, encounter and claims data is not possible. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 82 Dental CAHPS became available in July 2021 and will be used to address RQ 8.2.3 (What changes in the accessibility of dental health services occur with the implementation of the Statewide Medicaid Prepaid Dental Health Program?) and/or RQ 8.3.2 (How do enrollees rate their experiences and satisfaction with dental health services, including timeliness of dental health services, provided by their dental health plan?) Also, responses from dual-eligibles to telephone interviews concerning their assessments of their health care may unavoidably reflect a combination of Medicare and Medicaid experiences for behavioral health services. Florida implemented the MMA program statewide over a period of three months and enrolled the great majority of Florida Medicaid recipients into MMA at that time. Consequently, there does not exist an appropriate comparison group within Florida Medicaid following the implementation of the MMA program. This poses major issues for conducting either a standard difference-in-differences or propensity score matching analysis. Standard difference-in-differences analysis requires data on both treatment and comparison groups both prior to and subsequent to the implementation of the MMA program. Florida's shift of the vast majority of its Medicaid recipients into the MMA program over a very short period of time precludes identifying a comparison group from within Florida Medicaid post- implementation. While other groups (e.g., the privately insured in Florida or other states' Medicaid enrollees) could furnish a comparison group, such diverse groups are likely to violate the parallel slopes assumption of difference-in- differences since they will be subject to different spatial and temporal trends than MMA enrollees. Using such heterogeneous groups for propensity score matching to the MMA population poses similar challenges since such groups have intrinsic differences in geographical location and insurance coverage provisions that cannot be controlled through matching. A significant limitation in evaluating retroactive enrollment (Component 9) is the inability to identify enrollees after the policy change who would have been eligible for retroactive enrollment under the rules in effect prior to the policy change. The Agency estimates that only a small percentage of new non-pregnant Medicaid enrollees qualified for retroactive enrollment prior to the policy change. Consequently, the statistical precision of any effect of the policy change on current new enrollees who would have qualified for retroactive enrollment under the previous policy will likely be reduced by the presence of the large number of current new enrollees who would have been ineligible for retroactive enrollment under the previous policy.

Modified Difference-in-Differences Approach This section explains the two modified difference-in-differences methods that the evaluation team will employ in addressing selected questions in (1) the Housing Assistance Pilot (Component 10) and (2) the impact of Florida's retroactive enrollment policy change (Component 9). To set the stage for these modified approaches, we first present the standard difference-in-differences framework. Standard Difference in Differences Evaluations have commonly employed a pre-post design where the treatment group outcome is observed both prior to treatment and subsequent to treatment. The difference in outcomes between the post-treatment period and the pre-treatment period is then an estimate of the treatment effect. The obvious danger in such designs is that intervening time factors (sometimes called historical bias) that coincide with the implementation of treatment may introduce bias into the estimated treatment effect. Another common approach employs treatment and comparison groups where the comparison group is chosen to resemble the treatment group as closely except that the SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 90 comparison group only receives usual care. The difference in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups is then taken as an estimate of the treatment effect. The most common problem here is that treatment and comparison groups may differ from one another in unobserved ways that influence both choice of treatment and outcomes, leading to the selection bias described above. Difference-in-differences (D-i-D) is a research design that attempts to deal with both intervening factors and unobserved selection bias (Imbens & Wooldridge J, 2007). One drawback to D-i-D is that it requires more data than just pre-post observations on a treatment group as in a pre-post design or just a treatment and comparison group observed during the treatment period. D-i-D requires observing both a treatment and comparison group observed both prior to treatment (the pre period) and subsequent to treatment (the post period). SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 91 How D-i-D Works Figure 217 illustrates how difference-in-differences isolates the true treatment effect in the presence of biased selection. We observe both the treatment and comparison group both before and after the intervention in implemented. During the pre-intervention period, both the treatment and comparison groups are observed under usual care. At the intervention point, the comparison group continues to receive usual care while the treatment group transitions to the new intervention. D-i-D isolates the intrinsic difference or selection bias between the treatment and comparison groups by measuring the differences in outcomes in the two groups during the pre-intervention period when both groups are under usual care. To do this, the D-i-D approach assumes that both the treatment and comparison groups' time trends are equal. This is commonly called the \"constant slopes\" assumption. Figure 2 -How D-i-D Works Outcome Y Time Pre Intervention Post InterventionIntervention Treatment Post Treatment Pre Comparison PreComparison PostTreatment effect + \"Instrinsicdifference\" (selection bias) \"Instrinsic difference\" (selection bias) Treatment effect = (Treatment Post -ComparisonlPost) -(Treatment Pre -Comparison Pre) In the post-intervention period, the true treatment effect is obscured by the presence of the intrinsic difference between the two groups. Taking the difference between the treatment and control groups in the post-intervention period gives the sum of the true treatment effect and the intrinsic difference between the groups (the first difference in difference-in- differences). Then, subtracting from that difference the difference between the treatment and comparison groups in the pre-intervention period (the second difference in difference-in differences) gives the true treatment effect alone. Assumes Equal Time Trends Figure 3 shows why D-i-D must assume time trends for the treatment and comparison groups. Only if the time trends are the same will D-i-D yield a stable estimate of the intrinsic difference between the treatment and comparison groups. This is especially important when you have insufficient data across time to examine the treatment and comparison time trends in your data. When sufficient data are available, you can check this assumption by 17 Figure 1 has been omitted from this attachment for purposes of brevity. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 92 comparing the trends across time for the treatment and comparison groups. Figure 3 -D-i-D Assumes Equal Time Trends for Treatment and Comparison Groups Outcome Y Time Pre Intervention Post InterventionIntervention Treatment Post Treatment Pre Comparison PreComparison PostTreatment effect + \"Intrinsic difference\" (selection bias) \"Instrinsic difference\" (selection bias) Treatment effect = (Treatment Post -ComparsonPost) -(Treatment Pre -Comparison Pre) How is D-i-D Implemented? D-i-D is simple to implement in practice if data for the treatment and comparison groups are available both pre-intervention and post-intervention. The basic D-i-D model incorporates: 1) a pre/post period dummy variable, POST, where POST=1 during the post- implementation period and POST=0 during the pre-implementation period, 2) a treatment/comparison group dummy variable, GROUP, where (GROUP=1 for the treatment group and GROUP=0 for the comparison group), 3) the statistical interaction between these two main effects, POST x GROUP, and 4) the additional control variables, X, used in outcomes models (e.g., age, sex, and health status). The D-i-D regression equation is = +++ ++ Y is the outcome under study, X represents the control variables, the 's are the model coefficients, and is the disturbance term. Figure 4 shows graphically the way D-i-D works based on the D-i-D statistical model. In Figure 4, the outcome Y is on the vertical axis and time is on the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis is divided into pre- and post-intervention segments. The four straight lines in Figure 4 correspond to the treatment and comparison groups in the pre and post periods. The four model coefficient sums plotted on the Y axis show the predicted treatment and SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 93 comparison values for both the pre and post periods. Notice that the difference between the treatment pre and comparison pre values gives G, which is a measure of the intrinsic difference between the two groups prior to implementation. The difference between the treatment post and comparison post values gives the sum of the interaction coefficient, DID, and the intrinsic difference between the two groups, G. The difference-in-differences treatment effect is found by subtracting the treatment-comparison difference in the pre-period from the treatment-comparison difference in the post-period: (+) = The coefficient on the interaction term, , is the estimated treatment effect in a linear D-i-D model. Figure 4 -How is D-i-D Implemented? Outcome Y Time Pre Intervention Post InterventionIntervention Treatment Post Treatment Pre Comparison PreComparison PostTreatment effect = (Treatment Post -Comparison Post) -(Treatment and Relaxing the Strict Assumptions of Difference-in-Differences One approach for testing and relaxing the strict assumptions of D-i-D is to introduce a time trend main effect along with two-way interactions between time and POST and time and GROUP and a three-way interaction between time, POST, and GROUP as specified in the following equation (Harman, Lemak, Al-Amin, Hall, & Duncan, 2011): = ++++ + + + ++ Even when the number of time periods in the pre and/or post periods preclude estimating time trends, the standard D-i-D assumptions can be relaxed. University of Florida faculty member Keith Muller has observed that the standard D-i-D model can be translated from a two period, pre/post model into a single period, post-only model (Wegman et al., 2015). This single period model uses the baseline (pre-period) variables to relax the D-i-D constant slope assumption. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 94 Figure 5 shows how the standard D-i-D model is translated into this more flexible formulation. First, the standard D-i-D model is separated into two parts, one for the post period and one for the pre period. Then, these two equations are differenced to produce a single equation difference model. Lastly, the pre-period outcome, Y PRE, is placed among the regressors with a coefficient, Y, to be estimated. When Y is treated as a coefficient to be estimated rather than forced to equal one as in standard D-i-D, the constant slope assumption is relaxed. To be fair, however, this approach to D-i-D is not free of assumptions. The constant slope assumption is replaced with a constant baseline proportionality assumption based on the baseline value of Y. However, it is easy to add an interaction between Y PRE and GROUP so that the constant baseline proportionality assumption can differ between the treatment and comparison groups. While not perfectly flexible, this modification increases the generality of this D-i-D formulation. Note that this D-i-D formulation subsumes the standard D-i-D formulation as a special case when Y=1. Testing H 0: Y=1 and rejecting H 0: Y=1 in favor of H A: Y1 tells you that this new model formulation fits your data better than the standard D-i-D formulation. Conclusion We believe that testing for and relaxing the strict assumptions of D-i-D are important for studying the effects of retroactive enrollment policy on new Medicaid enrollee debt in Florida. In particular, we plan to use linked credit reporting data on medical debt for new Medicaid enrollees both prior to and subsequent to the change in retroactive enrollment policy. Consequently, we will have a very large sample size that will likely yield sufficient statistical power to detect very small changes in medical debt as statistically significant. It is therefore critical to disentangle the effects of retroactive enrollment policy from the other factors than can influence medical indebtedness (enrollee income, employment changes, physical and mental health status, etc.) as discussed in the introduction. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 95 In addition, selecting a control group for D-i-D is difficult since Florida chose to implement the retroactive enrollment policy statewide at a single point in time (February 2019). Consequently, it will likely be necessary to use pregnant women and children as the control group since they remained under the previous retroactive enrollment policy. Unfortunately, the assumption of constant slopes for men and non-pregnant women vs. pregnant women and children is especially tenuous given the obvious differences between these groups. This too argues for exploring techniques for testing and relaxing the constant trends assumptions in standard D-i-D. References Harman, J. S., Lemak, C. H., Al-Amin, M., Hall, A. G., & Duncan, R. P.

Appendix Florida Responses to \"CMS Implications of COVID-19 for Section 1115 Demonstration Evaluations: Considerations for States and Evaluations\"18 A. Introduction This section presents the Florida MMA evaluation team's comments and responses to the issues and questions raised by CMS concerning the impact of COVID-19 on the MMA evaluation. The comments and responses are in italics following the relevant CMS material. B. Documenting demonstration implementation and evaluation changes The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect demonstration implementation in multiple ways, including by changing provider and beneficiary behavior and rapidly increasing the pool of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in demonstrations. For example, providers may have adopted telehealth strategies, changing service delivery and potentially health outcomes for demonstration beneficiaries in ways that might persist in the long term. In addition, the pandemic has caused some states to pause or delay implementation of approved section 1115 demonstration policies, such as monthly payment requirements. These implementation changes, in turn, may necessitate adjustments to evaluations. Comment: We agree that the COVID-19 pandemic will have widespread impacts on Florida Medicaid and on the Florida MMA program in particular. The impacts on the MMA program specifically should be centered on the ongoing MMA program since no new MMA program implementations have been paused or delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the changes stemming from COVID-19 are 18 Section 1115 Demonstration Evaluations: COVID-19 Impacts Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 96 profound and will likely limit the comparisons of evaluation results prior to, during, and following COVID- 19. In addition, the three most recent components of the MMA evaluation (the prepaid dental and supportive housing programs and the retroactive enrollment policy changes) were implemented within one to two years of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, COVID-19 may delay the maturation of those components. Caution will be needed in interpreting early year-to-year changes in the evaluation results for those recently implemented programs. Suggested topics and questions for state consideration. The following questions may be useful as states think through evaluation challenges caused by COVID-19 and engage with their evaluators: How will changes to the demonstration affect the logic models or driver diagrams that guide the evaluation? Are all expected demonstration outcomes the same as before the pandemic? What new modifying or confounding factors, such as use of telehealth, might change expected outcomes? Which of these new factors are likely to be temporary, and which are likely to be persistent? Response: We do not believe that COVID-19 will directly affect our logic models or driver diagrams, but COVID-19 will undoubtedly independently influence many of the outcomes examined in the MMA evaluation. In particular, the likely reduction in face-to-face utilization and the associated increase in telehealth services bear close scrutiny. The magnitudes of these utilization changes need to be measured initially and monitored over time to gauge any lasting impacts stemming from COVID-19. In what ways will demonstration implementation changes affect planned evaluation activities? Response: We do not believe that COVID-19 will change any demonstration implementations since all the MMA evaluation components were implemented prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. How can states keep evaluators informed about demonstration changes? Are evaluators able to document changes to demonstration implementation so they can (1) consider how to amend planned evaluation activities and (2) use that information to interpret outcomes? Response: The evaluation team is currently relying on and will continue to rely on the Agency's website that chronicles changes stemming from the COVID-19 emergency, \"Brief Description of Changes During the State of Emergency\", at https://ahca.myflorida.com/COVID- 19_Medicaid.shtml#alerts . How does the timing of the demonstration approval period interact with the timing of the pandemic? That is, did the demonstration start before, during, or after the pandemic, and what does that mean for the evaluation design? Are there opportunities to observe demonstration outcomes before the pandemic began? Response: All the MMA evaluation components were implemented prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, baseline data are available for all MMA components. As discussed above, the greater concern may be about observing the evolution of the initial impacts of the more recent MMA components (i.e., prepaid dental, supportive housing, and retroactive enrollment) into longer term, steady-state impacts. How can evaluators account for large numbers of new demonstration beneficiaries? Are new demonstration beneficiaries likely to differ from previously enrolled beneficiaries in systematic ways, and if so, should evaluators conduct subgroup analyses to understand how these beneficiaries interact with demonstrations? SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 97 Response: We recognize that there are likely to be many new people enrolled in Medicaid due to the pandemic and they will likely differ somewhat from other enrollees. We view subgroup analyses defined by pre-post COVID-19 changes in enrollment by eligibility group as the best way to address this. C. Collecting primary data The pandemic is likely to affect primary data collection\u2014both interviews and surveys\u2014in multiple ways. States may decide to update data collection plans to reflect respondent availability, the need to avoid in-person data collection, the need to update survey instruments to reflect changes to demonstration policies or the health care or economic landscape (for example, changes to employment opportunities given furloughs and layoffs), the likelihood of confounded responses (that is, different responses during the pandemic), and/or the need to update sample designs to account for newly enrolled beneficiaries or subgroups with disproportionately high pandemic impacts. Some states may experience high survey response rates because beneficiaries are easier to reach at home. However, beneficiaries' responses will undoubtedly be affected by the pandemic. Providers may be relatively difficult to survey or interview if they are busy with the pandemic response, although providers' availability and responsibilities are also changing rapidly. States that planned to collect primary data in 2020 may decide to postpone it because of the factors noted above. Whether it is possible to postpone primary data collection and still use it as a data source for a given evaluation depends on the timing of the demonstration period\u2014for example, it would not be possible to postpone a planned 2020 survey until 2021 and still use it for the evaluation of a current demonstration period that ends in 2020. In addition to timing considerations, states making the decision to postpone, change, or move forward with primary data collection must balance the budgetary impacts of changes, the usefulness of data collected, the burden to respondents, and the importance of primary data for the evaluation. Comment: The MMA evaluation team has already begun to modify survey and interview content as well as the timing of data collection to reflect the broad reach of COVID-19. We expect these modifications to content and timing to continue as needed as the pandemic evolves. To date, these adjustments have only had minimal impacts on our primary data collection, but this will likely change as COVID-19 evolves and as our data collection efforts move past the first few months of 2020. Suggested topics and questions for state consideration. Primary data collection requires a significant investment of evaluation resources. CMS encourages states to discuss the need to update data collection plans and the impact that might have on evaluation budgets with their evaluators. The following questions may be useful: What is the advice of evaluators on whether and how to postpone primary data collection? Does this vary by respondent type? Can data collection reasonably be postponed given unknown timing of the pandemic and the timing of the demonstration period? What are the cost implications of timing changes and what priority should be placed on making such changes? Response: The evaluation team has coordinated and will continue to coordinate adjustments to the MMA primary data collection efforts with the Agency moving forward. These adjustments do vary by the nature of the intended respondents, the importance of the evaluation topic, and the likely impact of COVID-19 on the topic, so answers must be tailored to the specific circumstances at hand. At this point, we do not foresee any changes in costs stemming from any potential postponements. Do survey instruments or interview discussion guides require updates to reflect changes to SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 98 demonstration implementation or the health care or economic landscape (such as employment opportunities)? When will changes to demonstration activities be settled enough to redesign instruments? What are the cost implications of instrument changes and what priority should be placed on making such changes? Response: To date, we have identified required updates for specific instruments prior to their fielding and plan to continue this process in the future. We will confer with the Agency on a case-by-case basis when significant redesign and adaptation become necessary. How important is it to update survey samples to support subgroup analyses of newly enrolled beneficiaries and/or those with disproportionate pandemic impacts? How can evaluators define subgroups with disproportionate pandemic impacts for the purposes of changing the sample? What are the cost implications changing the sample design and what priority should be placed on making such changes? Response: We are in the process of monitoring changes in enrollments across eligibility groups as COVID-19 progresses to identify important subgroups based on the individual questions that comprise the MMA evaluation. Identifying specific subgroups with disproportionate pandemic impact on a per enrollee basis is especially challenging and will likely come as a result of a focused, in-depth evaluation of COVID-19 alone. D. Using time trends and comparison groups All time trends\u2014meaning changes in observed demonstration outcomes over time\u2014will be affected by the pandemic, to varying degrees. Evaluation designs that use comparison groups, such as difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs, will be more robust than trends and time series designs because they help to adjust for changes brought about by the pandemic. However, strong comparison groups must be similar to demonstration groups, including in terms of their COVID-19 impacts. CMS recognizes that states and their evaluators may be unable to assess the similarity of COVID-19 impacts on demonstration and comparison groups because the full extent of these impacts is still unknown and the best ways to measure impacts are not yet settled. CMS further recognizes that some states using designs without a comparison groups may be unable to introduce one to their approved designs. In some cases, using interrupted time series analysis may be a relatively robust approach, because this design uses many observations over a long period and does not require (1) a known trajectory for the pandemic or its effects or (2) a similar comparison group. CMS recommends that states avoid using pre/post designs, if possible. Comment: The MMA evaluation team agrees with the above comments. We believe it will be close to impossible to separate out COVID impacts using difference-in-difference since COVID is impacting everyone (i.e., no comparison group is available). While it's possible that some Medicaid enrollees will be more affected than others, that will be very hard to determine. Interrupted time series that accounts for the period coinciding with the pandemic is probably the most feasible approach. Suggested topics and questions for state consideration. The following questions may be useful as states think through evaluation challenges caused by COVID-19 and engage with their evaluators: Which components of the planned evaluation design use comparison groups? Can evaluators feasibly assess the similarity of COVID-19 impacts on demonstration and comparison groups? SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 99 Response: The MMA evaluation has not relied on comparison groups because the entire MMA implementation was universal and was implemented over a short three-month period. This has made it impossible to identify a truly comparable in-state comparison group for the MMA evaluation and is the major reason that the MMA evaluation has relied on interrupted time-series analyses. If the evaluation design includes time-based designs, would evaluators recommend changing them to better account for the pandemic? How many observation periods can be included? Response: Yes. The MMA evaluation team is considering the use of pre-MMA, MMA pre- COVID, MMA during COVID, and MMA post-COVID periods. Are there any opportunities to strengthen planned evaluation designs to account for the pandemic? If the evaluation design includes more than one analytic approach, should certain approaches receive greater focus? Response: In addition to the four-period time construct described in the answer to the previous question, the MMA evaluation team is considering whether geographic-specific monthly COVID- 19 incidence rates might be a useful control variable for those observed outcomes which are likely to vary directly with COVID incidence rates. E. Isolating demonstration effects Because of the magnitude of the changes brought about by the pandemic, it will be challenging to isolate demonstration effects from pandemic effects. CMS acknowledges that, for some demonstration outcomes, pandemic effects will be much larger than demonstration effects were expected to be, making any demonstration effects impossible to observe. In those cases, states and their evaluators may judge that some planned impact analyses\u2014depending on the timing of the pandemic during the demonstration approval period\u2014are unlikely to produce viable evidence about demonstration effects and are not worth the resource investment. States and their evaluators should identify such demonstration outcomes and keep CMS informed with explanations of any corresponding modifications to planned evaluation activities. In such scenarios, states are still encouraged to provide data or trends that show changes to expected demonstration outcomes even if those outcomes are not attributable to demonstration policies. Comment: We agree that disentangling COVID-19 impacts from changes in the demonstration impacts may be difficult or impossible in some cases. However, most MMA components have several years of pre- COVID MMA estimated impacts to serve as a baseline for evaluating COVID period changes. Isolating demonstration effects may also be difficult if the beginning of the demonstration period coincides with the beginning of the pandemic. In that case, it will be unclear whether states should attribute observed changes to the demonstration or to the pandemic. Conversely, demonstrations ending in 2020 or those spanning 2020\u2014for example, if data collection is planned for 2019 through 2021\u2014may be able to exclude some months in 2020 from analyses of demonstration outcomes, or to conduct robustness checks to explore the effects of including peak pandemic months. Exact months to exclude may not be clear until more information about the trajectory of the pandemic becomes available. Comment: Fortunately, the MMA program has no component whose beginning or ending coincides with the start of the COVID-19 period. SECTION 1115 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATIONS: COVID-19 IMPACTS CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES 100 Suggested topics and questions for state consideration. The following questions may be useful as states think through evaluation challenges caused by COVID-19 and engage with their evaluators: What is the relative expected magnitude of demonstration and pandemic effects for demonstration outcomes? Does it make sense to try to observe all planned demonstration outcomes, or only some? Response: This is difficult if not impossible to determine in the absence of information about the impact of COVID-19. However, given the relatively stable early MMA impacts as a baseline, it should be possible to highlight where either temporal changes in COVID-19 main effects or COVID-19 interactions with the MMA program have an outsize net impact. Do evaluators expect to be able to isolate demonstration effects to support conclusions about demonstration policies, and if so, how do they plan to do this? Response: Yes. In addition to pre-COVID-19 MMA impacts, we expect to control for MMA impacts during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as discussed above, we plan to use geographic- specific COVID-19 incidence rates as a control variable where feasible to help disentangle COVID-19 and MMA impacts. What covariates (measures) might be related to the pandemic, but not to the demonstration, and therefore appropriate to use as controls? Response: We believe that geographic-specific COVID-19 incidence rates is one important such covariate. If evaluators expect to proceed with planned analyses, is it feasible to drop certain months from those analyses, or to conduct robustness checks that assess the effect of including or excluding them? Response: At a minimum, it should be possible to conduct sensitivity tests by alternately including and excluding those months where COVID-19 incidence rates changed dramatically to measure the sensitivity of the estimated MMA impact to these changes. F. Interpreting findings Finally, even if states and their evaluators can adjust evaluation approaches in some of the ways suggested above, the severity of pandemic impacts will require cautious interpretation of observed outcomes. CMS requests that all interim and summative evaluation reports include discussions of potential confounding from the pandemic for each observed outcome or set of findings. Careful interpretation of findings is especially important because best practices for isolating demonstration effects in the context of the pandemic are not settled and because isolating demonstration effects may not be feasible for all demonstrations. Comment: We agree with this assessment and plan to use extreme caution in interpreting any dramatic change in the estimated MMA impact that coincides with substantial changes in COVID- 19 incidence rates.
