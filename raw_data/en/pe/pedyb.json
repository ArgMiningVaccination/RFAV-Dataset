[Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines on the CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html). Booster Shots People who are at higher risk should get a booster dose to continue to have the highest level of protection that the vaccines provide. COVID-19 Testing As of April 1, we are no longer offering COVID-19 testing. At-home antigen tests are available at local retail pharmacies and online. To get a PCR test, please visit your local urgent care center. COVID-19 Treatments There are several therapeutic drugs that are approved by the FDA or that have Emergency Use Authorization to treat or prevent COVID-19. Visiting Our Facilities As a part of our effort to keep patients and staff healthy during COVID-19, our visitor guidelines are frequently changing. Be sure you are aware of the latest policy in effect. Post-Acute COVID-Syndrome Clinic We provide care for patients with Post-Acute COVID Syndrome, also known as [long COVID](/long-covid), at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. Our multidisciplinary team can oversee evaluation and management of patients with this emerging problem. Long COVID The term long COVID does not necessarily mean that a person is still infected with the virus. It means that they are experiencing troublesome, often debilitating symptoms that last beyond 12 weeks after the acute infection is over. "}
