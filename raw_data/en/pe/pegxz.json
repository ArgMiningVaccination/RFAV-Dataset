Gondolfo, DC", "date": "2007-11-09", "cleaned_text": "time a child is 6 months old they are to be injected with at least 47 [vaccines](AskTheDoctor.aspx); at 18 months at least 67, and at 4-6 years at least 81!\u2014based on the 2008 CDC recommended schedule. Why are so many parents rejecting vaccinations for their children? This week we'll look at the first 3 most common answers: 1.) To have healthier children. Research reveals that [non-vaccinated](AskTheDoctor.aspx) children are healthier than vaccinated children. 2.) To protect my children from vaccine-caused diseases. It is typically the vaccinated children who have autism, asthma, allergies, skin disorders, immune system disorders, [neurological disorders](Welcome.aspx), ADD, ADHD, other behavioral disorders, meningitis, dyslexia, hearing and vision problems. These conditions are rare in the non-vaccinated. Robert Mendelsohn, MD writes: \"Immunization against relatively harmless childhood diseases may be responsible for the dramatic increase in...cancer, leukemia, [rheumatoid arthritis](AskTheDoctor.aspx), and Guillain-Barre syndrome.\" 3.) To protect my baby from crib death (SIDS). What we call crib death or [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome](AskTheDoctor.aspx) (SIDS) is, in many cases vaccination death. In 1975 Japan raised the minimum age of vaccination from 2 months to 2 years. Crib death, infantile seizures, meningitis and other infections diseases in infants virtually disappeared. Japan went from 17th in infant mortality to 1st (lowest in the world). \"Have we traded mumps and measles for cancer and leukemia?\"\u2014Robert Mendelsohn, MD. 4.) To protect my baby from being injected with toxic poisons. In addition to live and killed bacteria, viri and their toxins, children are injected with some of the most lethal poisons known: formaldehyde; sorbitol; monkey, cow, chick, pig, sheep and dog tissues and cells (may be contaminated with animal viruses); gelatin; casein; human fetal cells; human viruses; antibiotics; genetically modified yeast; and animal, bacterial and viral DNA (may affect recipient's DNA). 5.) I don't want to play Russian roulette with my child. No one knows the chances of your child being hurt or killed from a vaccination because only a fraction of children who are hurt is ever reported. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, MDs underreport [vaccination](AskTheDoctor.aspx) injuries by 90%. Another report revealed that only one in 50 vaccine-injured children (2%) is ever reported. 6.) Childhood diseases almost completely disappeared before vaccination. The death rate from mumps and pertussis (whooping cough) had decreased over 90% before widespread vaccination. The measles death rate had decreased nearly 98%. Diseases for which no vaccines were introduced, such as scarlet fever and typhoid fever, also decreased to virtually zero. 7.) There is no proof the polio vaccine decreased polio. Additionally the polio vaccine is linked to cancer. Due to improper filtering, a monkey virus (SV40) was included in the polio vaccine. SV40 is highly carcinogenic (caner-causing) and is linked to brain tumors, bone cancers, malignant mesothelioma (lung lining cancer) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 8.) I want my child to have natural immunity. Vaccination is unnatural. Diseases contracted naturally are filtered through [immune system defenses](AskTheDoctor.aspx) (i.e. skin and mucous membranes). However, vaccines are introduced into a child's body unnaturally\u2014direct injection into the child's blood stream\u2014giving the vaccine ingredients (bacteria, viri and toxins) access to all of the major tissues and organs of the body without the body's normal advantage of a total immune response. 9.) I want my child to be free of autism and learning disorders. After years of denying a link between vaccination and autism, on November 9, 2007 the US government in Court of Federal Claims admitted that vaccines can cause autism. This follows years of thousands of parents reporting their normal, healthy children descended into autism after receiving DPT, MMR or other vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics, in their January 2004 \"AUTISM A.L.A.R.M.\" bulletin, announced that 1 in 6 American children were diagnosed with a developmental disorder and/or behavioral disorder. Vaccination is creating a generation of neurologically damaged children. (If we include other types of vaccine damage such as allergy (including food allergy) and asthma, the numbers are far higher.) 10.) I don't want my child to get cancer. Pediatric cancer rates have been rising 1% a year since 1974 and cancer is currently the 2nd leading cause of death in children (after accidents). Leukemia and brain tumors, the most common childhood malignancies, are rising dramatically. \"Have we traded mumps and measles for cancer and leukemia?\" asks Robert Mendelsohn, MD. Vaccination in childhood is linked to autoimmune diseases, skin diseases, [degenerative diseases of bone and cartilage](AskTheDoctor.aspx) and tumors in adult life. 11.) No one knows if vaccine damage can surface years later. \"There are no adequate studies to determine the long-term effects of vaccines on our children and future generations\". According to Guylaine Lanctot, MD: \"Vaccination is a disaster to the immune system. It actually causes a lot of illnesses. We are changing our genetic code through vaccination.\" 12.) The flu vaccine has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. According to [Hugh Fudenberg, MD](MeettheDoctor.aspx), the world's leading immunogeneticist, if an individual has had five consecutive flu shots his/her chances of getting Alzheimer's disease is ten times higher. Is this why Alzheimer's is expected to quadruple? 13.) I want my child to have permanent immunity. Only [natural immunity](Welcome.aspx) lasts a lifetime and vaccines don't provide natural immunity. Also, when children are permitted to have infectious diseases of childhood they naturally lower their risk of cancer and heart disease in later life. 14.) The vaccines don't work. Outbreaks have occurred in 100% vaccinated populations. 15.) Vaccination dosage isn't personalized. A 5-pound premature baby will get the same dosage as a 60 pound 6-year-old. There is no personalization for weight, health, or any other reason. A single vaccine given to a 6-pound newborn is the equivalent of giving an adult 30 vaccinations on the same day. [Natural immunity](AskTheDoctor.aspx) is safer, natural immunity promotes healthier children; and natural immunity lasts forever.
