Crystal Gel is powered by 3 powerhouse active ingredients. An amino acid called glutathione that delivers an otherworldly glow, veronica flower derived collagen, along with cedar bark extract for damage repair and environmental stress prevention. This is our makeup artists favorite and is made with 100% vegan and organic ingredients. The Crystal Gel bottle is recyclable. Glutathione to brighten Cedar Bark to repair Veronica Flower to calm Organic Glycerin, Water, Propanediol, your ZIIP HALO full facial treatment, apply 4-8 pumps of the Crystal Gel to dry skin to activate the electrical currents in your ZIIP device. This amount must be used to allow the electrical wavelengths to flow through the skin. Crystal Gel can be used as an intensive masque on its own for up to 20 minutes. Before your ZIIP HALO full facial treatment, apply 4-8 pumps of the Silver Gel to dry skin to activate the electrical currents in your ZIIP device. This amount must be used to allow the electrical wavelengths to flow through the skin. Silver Gel can be used as an intensive masque on its own for up to 20 minutes. Yes, ZIIP Gel must be applied liberally to the treatment area (or full face & neck for full facials) before use. This allows the electrical current of our Dual Waveform Technology to effectively pass through the skin. Yes, every ZIIP device comes with a bottle of ZIIP Conductive Gel. The ZIIP HALO, our latest device, comes with a 50ml bottle of our Electric Complex Gel. Yes, the Crystal Gel doubles as an intensive masque that can be worn on its own or be left on after your ZIIP treatment for up to 20 minutes. Yes, the Crystal Gel can be used every time you ZIIP. However, if you experience sensitivity you may want to alternate with Electric Complex Gel, which contains no active ingredients, for every other treatment. Good stuff. Wondering if you can use something in place of glycerine? This is a wonderful conductive gel. I've used two bottles of the Golden gel and I've come to like this even more. It's hydrating and makes my skin glow.Thank you Ziip! I love my Ziip! All of the gels give you so much more slip than any other brand plus they don't dry out! If you do numerous treatments you might need a spritz of water. I like the Crystal, the gold and silver have hyaluronic acid in them, my skin doesn't like it. Crystal and Electric Complex are definitely the only gels I will ever use! Leave it on and spray a little mineral water when done with treatment ..at least that's what I do ..to many wonderful ingredients to waste It is so much easier and more economical than other gels that dry out.
