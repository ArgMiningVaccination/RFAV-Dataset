Naturopathic medicine is a method of healing that encompasses modern and traditional diagnostic methods with time honored natural remedies. The premise behind Naturopathic medicine is to find the root cause behind most ailments, helping Dr. Zigo create a targeted plan to address the problem. WHAT ARE NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS? Naturopathic physicians are primary care physicians who are trained in a wide variety of natural therapies. These therapies treat the whole person and involve healing the individual mentally, emotionally, and physically. WHAT ARE THE NATUROPATHIC PRINCIPLES? FIRST DO NO HARM. Preferred are the least invasive diagnostic procedures, treatments, and medicinal substances with minimal risk of harmful side effects. PREVENTION. Physicians assess risk factors, make early interventions, and promote wellness by supporting patients to create healthy lifestyles. THE HEALING POWER OF NATURE. Naturopathic medicine recognizes and encourages the inherent, ordered, and intelligent healing process in each individual. TREATMENT OF THE WHOLE PERSON. Physicians address the complex interactions of a patient's physical, emotional, mental, environmental, genetic, social and spiritual aspects. IDENTIFICATION & TREATMENT OF THE CAUSES OF DISEASE. Rather than merely eliminate symptoms, physicians identify and remove the underlying cause of illness. DOCTOR AS TEACHER. The physician educates and develops patient self-responsibility, and the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship is valued and cultivated. "}
