On a quick path to recovery, relieved and delighted with this development as an Ayurvedic Practitioner, I ordered it immediately and sat down with achy muscles (a fallout of the infection) to write about it. Read on! The current COVID19 pandemic has challenged the globe like very little before it. Even today, we are not entirely sure whether it will become endemic or whether we are on the brink of another wave. While we are encouraged to take care of our immunity, we are not alone in our quest to enhance health, wellness, and resilience. Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old science of life, practiced as medicine in India and a form of complementary medicine in the US. It has several herbs and formulations with experiential and evidence-based efficacy that help in the management of viral and respiratory ailments, as well as enhancing immunity. Pandemics are discussed in detail in Ayurveda, in the root text Charaka Samhita as Janapadodwamsa Vyadhi, and are said to be caused by vitiated air, water, or land. Based on Ayurvedic concepts, etiology, pathogenesis, and management protocols have been outlined for both prevention and disease management. The approach of Ayurveda differs because we focus on strengthening the host rather than on a disease. Ayurvedic Approach to Immunity The Ministry of Ayush (which governs Ayurveda in India) has used the term salutogenesis in the context of host defense in COVID-19. This age-old concept of Ayurveda deals with individual health creation, a reverse process to pathogenesis and a focus on disease. In Ayurveda, immunity is Vyadhikshamatva or Bala (strength), mentioned in the root text, Charaka Samhita, as managing both health and disease. It is the comprehensive resistance of the body-mind complex by either preventing the manifestation of a disease (Vyadhi Utpada Pratibandhakatvam) or withstanding its severity or Virodhitvam). Sri Sri Tattva's NAOQ19 (NF2) NAOQ19, a blend of 19 immunity-boosting herbs, is a carefully formulated and clinically tested product based on ancient Ayurvedic wisdom. It is recommended as a prophylactic in India against chronic viral infections, which I believe would aid in the management of COVID-19 and in post-COVID recovery. In addition to anti-viral support, the herbs in NAOQ19 are historically known to strengthen immunity and aid recovery. This is a proprietary formulation by Sri Sri Tattva, a 35-year-old global health and wellness company that donates 100% of its profits to the non-profit Art of Living Foundation. Sri Sri Tattva has world-class and extensive quality control, R&D, and manufacturing, combining the best of ancient Ayurveda principles with modern research in India, the US, and Europe, and global distribution. The Ayurvedic Concepts behind NAOQ19 Focus on Immunity and Rejuvenation During Pandemics Immunity in Pandemics\u2014Vydhikhamatva is of three types Sahaja (constitutional), Klaja (chronobiologic), or Yuktikta (acquired strength). Ojas or vitality (the essence of digestion and metabolism of the seven dhatus or tissues) contributes to this strength and is impacted by both genetics and epigenetics (lifestyle). Besides the obvious aspects of hygiene and social distance as needed, enhancing immunity is considered key in pandemics. This is done through a proper daily and seasonal regimen (Dinacharya, Ritucharya), cleansing (Shodhana including Panchakarma), tools like meditation to enhance Sattva (the light, clear quality of the mind), and using Rasayana herbs. Rasayana is a comprehensive aspect of rejuvenation (immunity and longevity) therapy. The herbs in NAOQ19 are well known for their Rasayana or antioxidant, antiviral potential and many have been used and studied extensively, with evidence-based results. In fact, more than half of the clinical studies in India during COVID19 have been in traditional medicine. Polyherbal Formulation of Immune Boosting, Anti-Viral Herbs Whole is Greater Than the Sum of the Parts! Ashwagandha, Yashtimadhu, Haridra (turmeric), Tulsi and Amruth (Guduchi or Giloy) have always been household names and more so, now. The 19 herbs and extracts in NAOQ19 have beneficial properties that, in my opinion, are used to help with various symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. These Ayurvedic herbs have been used since ancient times and in modern contemporary settings, backed by research. In Ayurvedic practice, these are considered efficacious in, Enhancing and strengthening the immune system Aiding in the management of respiratory disorders Having antiviral properties Promoting rejuvenation and recuperation. When we combine herbs, in a polyherbal formulation, the key traditional therapeutic herbal strategy considers achieving extra therapeutic effectiveness, usually known as polypharmacy or polyherbalism.

The pandemic has taught us how important it is to take care of our health and wellbeing, our planet, and each other. It has caused a paradigm shift and as the world limps back to a new normal, this is a good time to reflect on what practices you use to boost your immunity. At the start of the pandemic, I wrote about ten tips for boosting our immunity with Ayurveda. Fast forward to now, all of this has worked, with a focus on a healthy lifestyle, meditation, and keeping NAOQ19 handy!
