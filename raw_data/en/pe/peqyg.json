Board of Veterinary Examiners Julie Garnier, DVM, with Taiwan and Zorro.LeTTer FroM The Chair (continued on page 2) Government of the District of Columbia Vincent C. Gray, Mayor I'm so excited to be writing to you for the first time as the Board Chair. It's been awhile since we've updated you, and many things have happened since our last newsletter. First, there have been some changes to the make-up of our board. Dr. Gary Weitzman left the Board after relocating to San Diego, and the terms for Dr. Candace Ashley and Joan Schaffner (our consumer member) have ended. I extend my most heartfelt thanks for Dr. Weitzman, Dr. Ashley, and Ms. Schaffner for the dedication and the many hours of hard work they gave to the Board and all licensees in the District. With their leaving, I am also pleased to announce our new Board. As of December 20, 2012, our new veterinary board members are: Dr. Ashley Gallagher of Friendship Hospital for Animals, Dr. Elton Vyfhuis of Paws, Purrs and Exotics, and Dr. Leanne Lipton of Meridian Veterinary Services. Our new consumer member is Ms. Lisa LaFontaine of the Washington Humane Society. We're looking forward to coming together as a group and working with veterinarians, technicians, and the animal community at large as we continue to work to protect and enhance the health, safety, and welfare of animals in the District. I'm also pleased to announce that Dr. Vito DelVento has joined the Department of Health fulltime as the Executive Director of the Veterinary Board and Program Manager of the Animal Services Program. In his new capacity Dr. DelVento will be overseeing nearly all animal related issues in the District. He is a great asset to the city and it's great to have him join the staff. insiDe This issue Verificati on of Licensure 2 Accreditation Concerns 2 Presidential Inauguration 3 Licensure Renewal 4 Approved Continuing Education Courses 4 Avoid Purchasing Medications from Unlicensed Entities 5 DC Rabies Update 6 Animal Rabies Cases 7 Meet Our New Board Members 8 Spotlight on: Atlas District Veterinary Hospital 11 Board Seeks Expert Witnesses 12 Business Addresses 12 Open Session 12 Filing a Complaint with the Board 13 Board Orders 13 Change Address/Name 13 Board Members/Staff & Contact Infor mation 14 Your MaiLinG aDDress Changing your mailing address?

Paramount to this effort is incorporating our laws under the Health Occupations Revision Act (HORA). The Board has been working toward this goal for several years, and the bill that would accomplish this has recently moved from the Executive Office of the Mayor to Council. It was my pleasure to testify before the Committee of Health, chaired by Councilmember Yvette Alexander, to talk about the importance of veterinary practice in the District, the role of the Board of Veterinary Examiners, and urge her to move this legislation forward quickly. We are hopeful that a hearing will be scheduled and the bill will be passed soon so we can begin work on the regulations for veterinary licensees and facilities that will accompany the HORA and give us modern standards. We always welcome feedback from veterinarians and the public. If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions for the Board, please feel free to contact Board staff by e-mailing Dr. DelVento: vito.delvento@dc.gov with your questions, concerns, or suggestions.LeTTer FroM The Chair Fall 2013 l Page 2 D.C.

The purpose of this regulation is to ensure the integrity of the medication supply chain. Registered suppliers maintain records and processes to prevent counterfeit AVOID PURCHASING MEDICATIONS FROM UNLICENSED ENTITIES medications from entering the market. All businesses shipping medications, including controlled substances, into the District of Columbia must be registered with the Pharmaceutical Control Division. The Department recommends that prior to purchasing medications from a manufacturer or wholesale distributor that you receive written documentation from the supplier confirming that they have an active manufacturer and/ or wholesaler registration and controlled substance registration where appropriate with the Department of Health.

This is in large part thanks to a veterinary community that works to ensure that dogs and cats\u2014including feral cats\u2014maintain current vaccinations. Below are several anecdotes from 2013 that highlight the importance of maintaining vigilance on this issue. Raccoon Attack in Georgetown. On April 13, 2013 a gentleman was standing on the side of a residential Georgetown Street when a raccoon charged toward him, coming out of nowhere, and biting his leg, breaking the skin. A trap was set for the raccoon. The injured man reported the raccoon to be unusually light in color, and several days late, an unusually light colored raccoon was impounded and tested positive for the rabies virus. First Positive in Groundhogs Detected. On April 21, 2013 DC Animal Care and Control received a call about a sick groundhog in the family housing area on Bolling Air Force Base. Base Police reported that a woman was working in her yard when she and her husband were chased by the groundhog, even after throwing things at it to encourage it to leave. The groundhog stayed on the property until the Animal Control Officer arrived and impounded it. Although rabies is uncommon in rodents, it can affect large rodents such as groundhogs. This case represents the first rabies positive groundhog found in the District of Columbia. Fox Attacks Woman and Dog. On February 12, 2012 a woman was walking with her infant near Rock Creek Park in the Adams Morgan neighborhood when a fox ran up to her, bit her leg and ran off. Before Animal Control Officers could arrive on scene, the fox also attacked a dog. The fox was found under some bushes, impounded, and tested positive for rabies the next day. Cat from Ft. Dupont Tests Positive. Although there were no positive cats in 2012, Department of Health has found one rabies positive cat in 2013. On January 5, 2013, a man brought a stray cat to the DC Animal Care and Control Agency from the Ft. Dupont neighborhood in Southeast DC. The man reported that the cat had been stray in his area for several weeks, and that he had been feeding her. He became concerned when he saw the cat had lost control of her back legs. At the Shelter, the cat bit the man and shelter staff, and tested positive for rabies the next day. For more information, please visit: www.doh.dc.gov Fall 2013 l Page 6 D.C.

The Atlas District Veterinary Hospital (AtlasVet) was conceived in 2010, and opened to the general public on January 23, 2012. The location is 1326 H St NE directly across from the historic Atlas Theater. Dr. Antkowiak was formerly an ER veterinarian with SouthPaws Veterinary Specialists and Referral Center in Fairfax for fifteen years and Dr. Miller was with Caring Hands Arlington for six. AtlasVet is based on incorporating high quality veterinary medicine, the latest technology, a friendly, knowledgeable staff and creating an establishment that reflects the diversity and energy that personifies the H Street Corridor. AtlasVet has a strong internet presence and has embraced social media. In addition to the website (www.atlasvetdc.com ), AtlasVet has ( atlasvetdc ) as large following on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/ atlasvetdc ). Through social media, AtlasVet has been able to reach a broad demographic and keep clients informed on unique events, changes due to weather or traffic, and general day-to-day happenings at the clinic. Adopting a novel approach to client and animal comfort, AtlasVet has built a clinic with retractable tables (most doctors choose to sit on the rugs with their patients), an inviting and spacious lobby, and a ventilation system that is constantly refreshing the quality of air. The staff that populates AtlasVet is primarily DC based (85%), and many staff members are able to walk or bike to work. The staff makes AtlasVet the fun and friendly, yet professional clinic it was meant to be, where client service and patient care is paramount.
