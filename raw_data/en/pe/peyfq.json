Public Comments on Draft Waiver Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The State of Idaho, through the Idaho Department of Insurance ( IDOI) and in conjunction with Idaho's staterun health insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, submits this Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver (the Waiver or Section 1332 Waiver) request t o the Centers fo r Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a divis ion of the United States Health and Human Services (HHS), and to the United States Department of the Treasury (collectively, the Departments). This Waiver is being submitted in conjunction with a Section 1115 waiver (the Sectio n 1115 Waiver), which is expected to be submitted to the United St ates Health and Human Services (HHS) and to the United States Department of Treasury on or about August 12, 2019. Collective ly, the Section 1332 Waiver and this Section 1115 Waiver (the Wa ivers) seek to obtain any and a ll necessary federal approvals to empower Idahoans with income between 100% and 138% of the feder al poverty level (FPL) to choose the healthcare coverage option that is right for them w hether private insurance through Your Health Idaho, or through the future Medicaid option. The goals of the proposed Section 1332 Waiver, also known as th e Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver, are to: 1. Empower individuals to choose to p articipate in commercial heal th insurance coverage over public insurance options. 2. Provide affordable coverage opti ons to working Idahoans with ho usehold incomes above 100% of the Federal Po verty Level (FPL) who are U.S. citizens, regardless of Medicaid eligibility. As background, the Patient Prote ction & Affordab le Care Act (AC A) expanded affordability of health coverage in the individual healt h insurance market. Individual s and families with income between 100% and 400% FPL who were not otherwise eligible for Medicaid or affordable employer sponsored health insurance have b een able to qual ify for help p aying their health insurance premiums via Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTC). In addition, individuals and households with incomes between 100% and 250% FPL became eligible for help in p aying outofpocket costs such as deductibles, coinsurance or c opayments through costsharing reductions (CSRs). In Idaho, citizens between 100% a nd 400% FPL currently have acc ess to ACAcompliant, affordable qualified health plans through our statebased exchange, Your H ealth Idaho. This Idahodriven solution has resulted in approxim ately 85,000 citizens of our s tate attaining health insurance coverage, including approximately 18,000 citizens between 100% and 138% FPL. In fact, Your Health Idaho has one of the highest enrollments nationwide on a per capita basis, while also maintaining the lowest operating costs of any fully functioning statebased exchang e. Further, the local control of the exchange ha s allowed Your Health Idaho to be more responsive to local needs, and it remains one of the more robust and stable exchanges in t he country in terms of insurer participation, with at least three to four available options th roughout Idaho in 2019. Idahoans value the success of our statebased exchange and beli eve Idaho citizens deserve the choice to access private insuranc e. Idahoans also value a safe ty net option for our lowestincome citizens. In November 2018, Idahoans voted, via a referendum, t o expand Medicaid in accordance Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 4 with the ACA, which allows Medic aid eligibility to individuals with income up to 138% FPL who were not previously eligible for public coverage under previous ly established eligibility categories (age, disability, parental status, etc.).1 Through this vote, access to health coverage was expanded to individuals with income below the poverty level, but, consequen tly, this ballot measure also threatened continued access to aff ordable coverage options for individuals and families with income slightly above the federal poverty level who are enrolle d in, or wish to begin taking advantage of, the many affordabl e health plans available throug h Your Health Idaho. Idahoans place great importance on the freedom to make choices that best suit their individual situation and the needs of their families. In passing the ball ot measure for Medicaid expansion, the objective was to add an affordable coverage choice for our most vulnerable citizens. Unfortunately, certain provisions in the ACA apply too broadly and threaten to remove health care coverage options available to a subset of lowincome Idaho ans currently eligible for or en rolled in coverage through the exchange. Many of th ese individuals have chosen cov erage through a specific health insurer due to existing doctor r elationships, for example, whic h may be more difficu lt to maintain if they are enrolled in Medicaid. Due to the discrepancies between Medicaid eligibility and APTC eligibility, individuals with income between 100% and 138% FPL current ly receiving APTC and CSR will lose the ability to take advantage of those subsidies upon implementation of Medicaid ex pansion in Idaho. The 2019 Idaho State Legislature sought to correct this unintended conse quence of Medicaid expansion through the passage of SB 1204, which requires the submission o f this Waiver to receive federal approval to maintain choice for these individuals. Consistent w ith this legislation, the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver seeks to extend APTC and CSR eligibility to individuals and families with income between 100% and 138% FPL to enable the choice to retain their subsidies and continue participation in Your Health Ida ho, regardless of their potenti al future eligibility for public assistance through the Medicaid expansion. In October 2018, the Departments released new guidance related to Section 1332 of ACA stating: \"The new guidance gives states more flexibility to address prob lems caused by the PPACA and to give Americans more options to ge t health coverage that better meets their needs.\"2 The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver recognizes that a one size fits all Medi caid option may not be the best coverage option for everyone, pa rticularly for individuals who have been participating in the available Your Health Idaho coverage for more than five years. A Medicaid expansion should expand coverage options, not eliminate them. In Idaho, we have a history of w orking together to help vulnera ble citizens with affordable, comprehensive coverage options. Our voters have used the ballo t box to support Medicaid 1 The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is currently workin g to effectuate and operationalize Medicaid expansion in the state . The State Plan Amendments required for this expansion have not yet been approved by CMS but are expected to be in place by January 1, 2020. 2 Fact Sheet: State Relief and Emp owerment Waiver Guidance, Octo 2018. ication - Coverage Choice 5 expansion. We are seeking this Waiver to accomplish the comple mentary goal of further expanding health care coverage choices and maintaining current coverage o ptions that are working for many Idahoans. Through this Section 1332 Waiver, Idaho aims to empower individ uals between 100% and 138% FPL to choose between keeping their current coverage by maintai ning their APTC or moving to the newly available public Medicaid option. Over time, as new appl icants between 100% and 138% FPL consider their coverage opti ons, we seek to empower their i nformed decision making and honor their selections between A PTC or Medicaid as well. Ultim ately, the goals of the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver are aligned with one of the key objectiv es of the Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver\u2014\"to give all Americans the opportunity t o gain quality and affordable health coverage regardless of inc ome, geography, age, sex, or h ealth status.\" 3 Idahoans between 100% and 138% FPL should be able to keep their quality and affo rdable health coverage rather than being forced to a public op tion. Promoting private coverag e options and consumer choice is the keystone of this Waiver and, as such, is aligned with the g oals of the Departme nts and meets all the criteria for a Sectio n 1332 Waiver approval. ASSURANCES Idaho's Coverage Choice Waiver is designed to meet the four key requirements of any Section 1332 Waiver: comprehensiveness; afford ability; scope of coverage; an d federal deficit neutrality. As demonstrated by the full economic and actuarial analyses in App endix A of this application, the State of Idaho provides th e following assurances: Comprehensiveness. Section 1332(b )(1)(A) of the ACA requires th at any waivers provide coverage at least as comprehensive as that defined in Section 1302(b) of the ACA. Comprehensiveness of coverage will be unchanged by th e Waiver, as Idaho does not pro pose to waive any of the requirements concerning the Essential Health Benefits. Further, the Waiver will not result in individuals losing coverage or m oving to less co mprehensive cov erage, but rather it enables Idahoans the choice to maintain their existing comprehensive ACAcompliant health plan as opposed to being mandated into Medicaid coverage. Affordability. As required und er Section 1332(b)(1)(B) of the A CA, the proposed Waiver provides for coverage and costsharing pr otections at least as affordabl e as those provided under Title I of the ACA. The proposed Waiver does not propose to waive any of t he affordability requirements of the ACA. In fact, this Waiver will increase affordable health coverage options for individuals currently participating in the ex change with income between 100 % and 138% FPL by opening up the choice to retain their Your Health Idaho qualified health p lan once otherwise eligible for Medicaid. 3 Section 1332 State Relief and Emp owerment Waiver Concepts, Dis Coverage Choice 6 Scope of Coverage. Section 1332( b)(1)(C) of the ACA requires th at any Section 1332 Waiver must provide coverage to at least a comparable number of state resid ents as is provided under Title I of the ACA. Idaho's proposed Waiver , in isolation, will simply all ow Idahoans currently with health coverage through the exchange to continue with the same coverag e choices available to them today. When considered in combination with any future Medicaid expansi on, APTC participation may decrease modestly over time, but any such decreases will be a r esult of individuals choosing alternative comprehensive coverage, resulting in potential increases in total coverage within the state. Deficit Neutrality. Section 1332( b)(1)(D) of the ACA requires t hat waivers be deficit neutral. Idaho's proposed Waiver will not result i n increased federal spending, and instead it is expected to result in a savings of federal money compared to the status quo. Because we anticipate some individ uals with income between 100% and 138 % FPL will decline their APTC a nd choose to enroll in Medicaid, the Waiver will result in reduced federal APTC spendi ng. That said, if every individual were to maintain their current exchange plan choice, the Waiver would, inherently, still be deficit neutral each year and over any tenyear projection. Table 1 Projected Federal Government Expenditures Changes: 2020 through 2029 (Millions) Revenue / (Expense) Item 2019 2021 2024 2025 2026 2027 434.1 454.6 $ 487.4 $ 522.4 $ 756.7 $ 802.4 Federal APTC Expenditures (Waived Medicaid Eligibility) $ 434.1 $ 436.9 $ 463.8 $ 492.5 $ 643.0 $ 676.2 $ 711.4 Net Change in Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 7 DESCRIPTION OF IDAHO'S SECTION 1332 WAIVER PROGRAM The Idaho legislature passed SB 1204, instructing the Idaho Dep artment of Health and Welfare (IDHW) and the Idaho Department of Insurance (IDOI) to seek a w aiver from the federal government to permit i ndividuals and familie s who have an adjus ted gross income at or above 100% of FPL to receive the APTC to purchase a qualified health plan through the Idaho health insurance exchange, notwithstanding the implementation of Medic aid expansion. Any individual who is otherwise eligible for Me dicaid may still choose to enro ll in Medicaid inste ad of receiving the APTC to purchase a qualified hea lth plan; however, this Waiver seeks to ensure that no Idahoan is forced to leave his or her exchange coverage due to the termina tion of federal subsidies for individuals between 100% and 138% FPL. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver is projected to affect the Ida ho individual health insurance market beginning in 2020. This W aiver application assesses the coverage and spending in the individual market as it currently exists in 2019, compared to t he coverage and spending in the individual market with the Waive r in place once individuals bet ween 100% and 138% FPL are given the opportunity to choose between Medicaid or subsidized exchange coverage.4 COMPREHENSIVENESS & AFFORDABILIT Y ANALYSIS OF IDAHO COVERAGE CH OICE WAIVER PROGRAM Per recent CMS guidance, compreh ensiveness and affordability gu ardrails are met if the waiver provides access to coverage that is at least as comprehensive and affordable as coverage to a comparable number of people as w ould have access absent the wai ver.5 This revised waiver guidance does not require consider ation of the number of people actually purchasing the comprehensive coverage through the exchange but is rather focus ed on access, regardless of the individual's ultimate choice of coverage. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver does not seek to make any chan ges to the comprehensiveness or affordability requirements of ex isting exchange plan products. Your Health Idaho will continue to offer the same quality health plans that meet the high standard s of the state and federal requirements, including coverage of the essential health benefi ts. Further, this Waiver will not make any changes to the cost sha ring requirements of the ACA. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver merely adds an additional choice, specifically, the Medicaid al ternative benefit plan, for individuals with income between 100% and 138 % FPL. With the Waiver, individ uals in this income bracket will retain full access to t he affordable and co mprehensive health c overage options they have come to 4 Per CMS and Treasury Department guidance, futur e proposed chan ges to the Medicaid state plan that are subject to federal approval are not factored into the assessmen t, and, therefore, are not within the scope of this Waiver application. See 83 Fed. Reg. 53575, 53583 (Oct. 24, 2018); available at https://www.govinfo.gov/conten t/pkg/FR20181024/pdf/20182318 2.pdf. 5 Overview of 1332 Guidance for Sta te Relief and Empowerment Wai 2018; Waiver - Coverage Choice 8 expect from Your Healt h Idaho, regardless of any future eligibi lity changes occurring within Idaho's Medicaid program. COVERAGE ANALYSIS OF IDAHO COV ERAGE CHOICE WAIVER PROGRAM The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver will offer more coverage optio ns for Idahoans. The full analysis of the coverage guardrail, inclu ding data & assumptions, actuar ial certification, and economic analysis, are found in Appendix A, and summarized below. Individual market ACAcompliant enrollment is estimated at 98,3 00 Idaho residents in the 2019 plan year. Without this Section 1332 Waiver, this is expected t o rise to an estimated 108,100 in 2029, as shown in Table 2 below. Table 2: Without Waiver Individual Market Enrollment Projected Individual Market Enrollees by Household Income Status Quo (Thousands) Income Level % of FPL 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Below 100% 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.7 1.7 100% to 138% 18.6 18.8 19.1 19.3 19.5 19.8 20.0 20.2 20.5 20.7 21.0 138% to 400% 62.1 400%+ 24.6 24.4 25.4 25.0 24.5 24.1 23.6 are rounded separately. 2. Values exclude nonACA compliant coverage. 3. Persons with income below 100% FPL reflect lawfully present non citizens qualifying for federal premium assistance. By contrast, with the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver, individuals with income between 100% and 138% FPL will be able to choose to participate in Medicaid cove rage. Due to this change, individual market enrollment growth is proj ected to decrease slightly from 2020 to 2029 relative to growth without the waiver, as a portion of individuals with income bet ween 100% and 138% are instead expected to choose to obtain cove rage through the Medicaid prog ram. See Table 3 below.

Values exclude nonACA compliant coverage. 3. Persons with income below 100% FPL reflect lawfully present non citizens qualifying for federal premium assistance. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver is not expected to have any im pact on the number of insured Idahoans, rather it is expected to cause a redistribution of co vered lives due to the individual choice of participation in either Medica id or Your Health Idaho plans, as demonstrated in Table 4. Table 4: Total Coverage Changes With/ Without Waiver Projected Insured Lives Between 100138% FPL Receiving Subsidiz ed Coverage Waiver Year Status Quo (Without Waiver) Idaho Coverage Choic e (With Waiver) Medicaid Enrollment Choice APTC Enrollment Choice 2019 18.6 0.0 18.6 2020 18.8 1.7 17.1 2021 19.1 2.2 16.9 2022 19.3 2.7 16.6 2023 19.5 3.1 16.4 2024 19.8 3.6 16.1 2025 20.0 4.1 15.9 2026 20.2 4.6 15.7 2027 20.5 5.0 15.4 2028 20.7 5.5 15.2 2029 21.0 6.0 15.0 are rounded. Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 10 Amongst the population with inco me between 100% and 138% FPL al ready receiving APTC, it is estimated that approximately 1,700 would choose to enroll in Me dicaid in 2020, increasing over time to approximately 6,000 by 2029. These values do not reflec t Idahoans with income between 100% and 138% FPL who are already eligible but not participatin g in APTC who may be more likely to select Medicaid coverage, if that option is made available. By offering a choice of coverage options, overall, the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver, taken toget her with any future Medicaid expansion, is expected to maximi ze the potential for reductions in the uninsure d rate for the population with income between 100% and 138% FPL. SPENDING ANALYSIS OF IDAHO COV ERAGE CHOICE WAIVER PROGRAM Amongst the population already el igible for APTC (100% to 400% Idahoans enrolled in indiv idual market health insurance plans and receiving the APTC in 2019, growing to approximately 84,600 in 2029. Without the Wai ver, the average APTC is projected to increase to $790.19 PMPM in 2029. By contrast, un der the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver, because a percentage of i ndividuals currently receiving APTC with higher acuity health care needs are expected to choose to e nroll in Medicaid, average APT C spending is estimated to be reduced slightly to $7 53.71 PMPM by 2029. Table 5 summarizes th e projected APTC enrollment and expenditures for 2019 through 2029, both with and without t he Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver. Table 5 Projected APTC Enrollment With and Without Waiver 2019 2020 2021 2022 2024 17.6) ($ 23.6) ($ 30.0) ($ 37.0) ($ 44.7) ($ 52.9) ($ 61.6) ($ 70.7) ($ 80.5) ($ 91.0) Note: Net values are rounded separately. 6 Table also includes lawfully pr esent individuals with income b elow 100% FPL qualifying for federal premium assistance. Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 11 Beginning in 2020, savings to the federal government in the for m of APTC payments are estimated at approximately $18 million, growing to $91 million in 2029. T he full assumptions and methodologies of this projecti on can be found in Appendix A. In summary, the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver is substantially l ess costly to the federal government over the tenyear bud get than compared to current st atus quo spending projections, all while maintaining and growing co verage levels overall. Despite the decreased spending on APTC, the number of covered lives will increase. By simply empowering individuals to choose their preferred coverage option for th eir particular needs, the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver meets the coverage, affordability, accessi bility, and cost guardrails est ablished in the ACA for 1332 waivers. LEGISLATION Legislation was passed by the 20 19 Idaho State Legislature mand ating the content and submission of this Section 1332 Waiver appl ication. Please see Appendix B for the full text of statute. LIST OF REQUESTED WAIVED PROVISIONS Section 1332 of the ACA allows s tates to apply for a State Inno vation Waiver/ State Relief and Empowerment waiver. The key aim of a Section 1332 waiver is to support states' innovation in offering their citizens greater choice and affordability in hea lth insurance coverage options. Section 1332 authorizes the Secretaries t o waive specific requirements of the ACA to foster state innovation, provided the statutory guardrails are met.7 This Waiver application seeks to waive a specific constraint in Section 36 B of the Internal Revenue Code related to eligibility for federal subsidies for qualified health p lans. Specifically, 26 U.S. Co de \u00a7 36B(c)(2)(B) provides that individuals are not eligible for federal subsidies if such indi viduals are eligible for other qualifying coverage, including Medicaid. By waiving this restriction, indi viduals with income between 100% and 138% FPL will be able to maintain their APTC and CSR, and b y extension the af fordable health coverage they have been receiving, regardless of any potential future changes to the Medicaid eligibility that would, absent t his Waiver, make them ineligibl e to maintain those subsidies. Below is the specific waiv er provision requested: 1. Eligibility for Federal Subsidies: Section 36(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (and, as applicable Section 1402 of the ACA) To the extent necessary to modify the eligibility criteria for APTC and CSR to permit Idahoans with income between 100% and 138% FPL to qualify for t hese federal subsidies, 7 Per the ACA, the Secretaries ha ve authority to waive the follo wing: Part I of Subtitle D of Title 1 of the ACA (Qualified Health Plans); Part II of Subtitle D of Title I of t he ACA (exchange); Sections 36B of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and 1402 of t he ACA (federal subsidies for e xchange plans); Sect ion 4980H of the IRC (employer shared responsibilit y); and Section 5000A of the IRC (individual shared responsibility). Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 12 provided they are not enrolled in Medicaid, regardle ss of their underlying eligibility for Medicaid. IMPACT IF WAIVER NOT GRANTED The Waiver, if not approved by Ja nuary 1, 2020, will directly d isrupt health care coverage availability for Idahoans with incomes between 100% and 138% FP L currently receiving health care coverage through Your Healt h Idaho and eligible to receive the APTC to help offset their outof pocket premium costs. If this Waiver is not approved (and at su ch time Medicaid expansion becomes effective in Idaho), the se individuals will lose their existing APTC eligib ility. Loss of this critical cost sharing subsidy wi ll effectively eliminate access to their Your Health Idaho health plan and force enrollment in to a public option th ese individuals did not choose.8 Because healthcare provider networks vary between coverage plans, this change coul d cause additional disruptions to their health care, potentially altering these individuals' acce ss to healthcare providers as well. CHARACTERISTICS OF IDAHO HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET Per the United States Census Bur eau, the overall Idaho populati on was estimated at 1,754,208 as of July 1, 2018. Of these Idahoans, 25.8% are under age 18; 58.8% are at least age 18 but under age 65; and 15.4% are age 65 and older. As of July 2017, the Depart ment of Labor estimated median household income was $50,985, wi th 12.8% of Idahoans living bel ow the federal poverty level. Concerning the health insurance status of Idaho residents, the IDOI performs an annual survey of health insurers to determine the number of Idahoans with commer cial health insu rance coverage, as well as the type of coverage (individual versus group, fully insured versus selffunded, etc.). At the end of 2017, 110,140 Idaho residents were enrolled in indiv idual major medi cal coverage, including both onexchange and off exchange. Approximately 18,0 00 of these enrollees are estimated to have income between 100% and 138% FPL. Another 29 2,782 residents were enrolled in group coverage; of these, 80, 376 were covered through small employers. Selffunded employer plans reported 328,717 covered individuals as of the end of 201 7. Concerning coverage through public programs, CMS estimated that 188,702 Idahoans were enrolled in original Medicare and 75,964 were enrolled in Medic are Advantage plans in 2017. CMS further estimated Medicaid enro llment for Idahoans was 261,030 in 2017 (including children and adults), while enrollment in the Children's Health Insurance Pr ogram (CHIP) was 36,658 for the same year. 2017 TRICARE enrollment for Idahoans was 52,483, and those enrolled in VA Care numbered 44,935. Idaho has been operating a succe ssful statebased exchange sinc e 2015. The local, statebased control of Your Health Idaho has led to a robust and stable mar kets since its inception. For 2019 in 8 See SEA 1204, Section 1, Section 56253( 9)(b), which provides, \"If the waivers described in this subsection are not approved before Janua ry 1, 2020, then the person descr ibed in this subsection shall be enrolled in Medicaid.\". Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 13 Idaho, the four onexchange insur ers are offering a total of 11 3 individual and 144 small group health plans, with a wide range of lowcost options and plans w ith modest rate increases year over year. For a more detailed analysis of the Idaho Health Insurance Mark et and the data provided herein, please refer to the Health Insurance Survey Report, published b y the Idaho Department of Insurance.9 ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN Idaho anticipates that any admin istrative burden under the Idah o Coverage Choice Waiver would be slight or otherwise immateria l. As previously noted, Idaho a lready has effective administrative processes and systems for assessing eligibility for, and enroll ing individuals in, Your Health Idaho coverage plans. Likewise, the same systems are also used to pr ocess Medicaid enrollment applications today. Idahoans between 100% and 138% FPL already have access to, or a re enrolled in, health care coverage through Your Health Idaho. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver allows these individuals between 100% and 138% FPL to mai ntain their existing health car e coverage after Idaho's Medicaid expansion takes effect. Idaho would continue utilizing its existing processes and systems for those individuals who retain their coverage and APTCs under Idaho's StateBased health exchange after January 1, 2020. I daho expects to incur minimal administrative costs through any notices to beneficiaries that may be necessary as a result of t he approved waiver. To the extent possible, Idaho's approach will be to include new notices as pa rt of existing mailings and online notices, because our goal is to make it seamless and easy for c onsumers to make informed coverage choices. Due to the statebased exchange, the administrative changes nec essary to support the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver (which are expected to be minimal) will occur entirely at the state level. No changes will be required of the f ederal government to support t he Waiver, as this Section 1332 Waiver would simply preserve cu rrently established coverage opt ions and insurance infrastructure. Further, Idaho d oes not expect t he Waiver to in crease the administrative burden on individuals, insurers, or employers. EFFECT ON ACA PROVISIONS NOT WAIVED The Waiver seeks only to preserve individual choice after Idaho 's Medicaid expansion takes effect for individuals between 100% and 138% FPL. The Waiver affects n o other section of the ACA than those provisions cited herein. 9 Health Insurance Survey Report, Idaho Lives CoveredEnd of Survey Year. August 10, 2018. Available at: https://doi.idaho.gov/DisplayPDF ?id=17HealthInsuranceSurvey&cat =Company Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 14 EFFECT ON IDAHOANS NEEDING TO O BTAIN SERVICES OUT OF STATE The Waiver maintains existing coverage options for Idahoans, in cluding those who wish to retain their current Your Health Idaho h ealth plan, and its coverage f or outofstate services. Idaho does not seek to change or eliminate outofstate services provided to individuals in their health plan under this Waver. Rather, indivi duals will continue to be able to receive outofstate health care services state consistent with the terms and conditions of thei r exchange health plan or under the terms of their Medicaid coverage, as applicable. As a result, t he Waiver does not affect residents who need outofstate services or the States in which individua ls receive such health care services. PROVIDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH INFORMATION 45 C.F.R. 155.1308(f)(4)(v)(D) is not applicable because the pr oposed Waiver will not be administered at the Federal leve l. Rather, this Section 1332 Wa iver modifies eligibility for health coverage through Idaho's existing, statebased health exchange program. WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE Neither the IDHW nor the IDOI are seeking to establish any new programs under the Waiver, but rather the two departments request that individuals between 100 % and 138% FPL be allowed to remain on Your Idaho Health and receive APTCs af ter Idaho's Med icaid expansion takes effect. Under an approved Waiv er, Idaho would continue utilizing existi ng processes and procedures to both monitor and take necessary a ction to address waste, fraud, and abuse under both programs by individuals, employers, and/or i nsurers both within the state a nd outofstate. Examples of such existing processes and procedures include: Your Health Idaho's APTC verific ation currently follows robust procedures and standards, as previously approved by CMS and maintained by the Idaho State Plan. All applicants must establish re sidency and legal status and ar e subject to periodic verification. Suspected fraud is promptly reported to the IDOI for investigation. Your Health Idaho conducts initi al and periodic verification of nonfinancial criteria; consumers are disenrolled for fr aud, intentional misrepresentat ion, or nonpayment of premiums. In addition, it also m onitors enrollment counselors t o ensure interactions with the public are ethical. The Board and its Finance Committ ee oversee Your Health Idaho's financial integrity and work to ensure funds are spent wisely; an independent auditor p erforms annual financial and programmatic audits for the Committee's review. The IDOI's Consumer Services Bure au serves to protect consumers from illegal or deceptive practices, investigates allegati ons of individuals filing fraud ulent insurance claims, and receives and researches consumer c omplaints against insurers an d others transacting insurance business. Idaho Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigat es and prosecutes Medicaid fraud in any facility that accepts Medicaid funds. Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 15 The IDOI's Company Activities Bureau monitors the financial con dition of all health insurers transacting business in Idaho, with particular emphasis includi ng examination of those domiciled within the state, to assure company solvency. It also licenses and regulates insurance producers. PUBLIC HEARINGS AND TRIBAL NOTICE The draft Section 1332 Waiver wa s publicly posted on the IDOI a nd IDHW websites. Public hearings were held in two different locat ions on June 24, 2019 (Boise) a nd June 27, 2019 (Lewiston). (See Appendix C). Public comments wer e received in person and in wri ting at the hearings, as well as in writing via mail and electronically via email through the comme nt period, which ended June 30, 2019. Separate notice to tribal repres entatives was provided (Appendi x D), and a tribal consultation was held June 17, 2019. Comments at that meeting requested inclusio n of language recognizing tribal status and protections into the special terms and conditions fo r the Waivers. In addition, discussions focused on ensuring adequate education, including r elevant information specific to American Indian/ Alaskan Native (AI/AN) individuals eligible fo r the Waiver. As described in more detail below, consumer education will be a key component in the successful implementation of this Waiver. PUBLIC COMMENTS The public comment period for this Section 1332 waiver facilita ted robust public input, generating nearly 300 comments f rom stakeholders. In addition to expressin g generalized opposition or support for the Waiver, the public commentary contained several regularly occurring themes regarding the relative covered benefits and costs of the availa ble plan choices as well as the importance of member education in the process. These broad them es are summarized and discussed below, while copies of the individual comments receiv ed through the public notice period on this Section 1332 Waiver application are included as Appendi x E of this application. On the whole, a substantial number of commenters compared the c overed benefits and costs of Your Health Idaho plans relative to Medicaid. Some individuals presumed that Medicaid was superior in terms of a ll relevant factors (i.e. benefits, costs , etc.) and, therefore, concluded that individuals should not be permit ted to choose a perceived lesse r choice. By contrast, others highlighted the benefits of priv ate coverage, an d concluded tha t individuals should be permitted to maintain their existin g coverage, particula rly their existing p rovider relationships. Ultimately, healthcare coverage selection is a highly individualized decisi on (as demonstrated by the variety of opinions received during the public comment period). The Idaho Coverage Choice waiver simply seeks to empower individuals to make the healthcare decision th at is right for their unique individual circumstances. However, empowered individuals must be informed individuals, and IDOI and IDHW recognize that comprehensive education is param ount to the success of this Wai ver. One resounding theme that dominated the majority of commen ts, both those in support and i n opposition to the Waiver, Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 16 stressed the importance of presenting the coverage choice throu gh a clear and unbiased eligibility and enrollment process, by provid ing consumer education and com parisons, as well as training to enrollment assisters. Only throug h such an undertaking would Id ahoans have the tools and information to make a truly informed decision as to the most ap propriate coverage for themselves and their families. The IDOI an d the IDHW agree, and recognize and appreciate the necessity for transparency, education and training in implementing this Secti on 1332 Waiver. IDHW currently handles eligibility determinati ons for both Medicaid and APTC t hrough a unified application, which is expected to continue under thi s Waiver. While the detailed operational processes for implementing changes to that system to support the Idaho Covera ge Choice Waiver are still being developed, the public comments related to educa tion will be tak en under advisement and will inform the ultimate implementati on of the Waiver with the inten tion that Idahoans affected by this waiver clearly understand their available coverage options, and the impact of their choice. One particular point that will be included in any consumer educ ation will be the ability and limitations on changing plan sele ction during the benefit year. The public comments on the Waiver demonstrated a predominate misco nception that individuals would be locked into their choice for the duration of the benefit year. To clarify, individuals part icipating in this Waiv er may voluntarily choose to transition from Your He alth Idaho plan to Medicaid at any time during the benefit year. However, once enrolled in Medicai d, individuals eligible for th e Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver will only be able to transition to a Your Health Idaho health plan d uring the annual open enrollment period or during a special enro llment period in accordance with existing exchange enrollment rules. This policy aligns with t he policies of each underlying program. Beyond clarifying this policy and taking other operational reco mmendations under advisement, the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver is being submitted in accordance w ith its enabling state legislation, SB 1204, and must comply with the requirements set forth in the law. Therefore , IDOI and IDHW are unable to make any other substantive changes to this Waiver based on public comments. TIMELINE AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN The implementation plan under the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver focuses foremost on ensuring simplicity and transparency for the consumer in making their he althcare coverage choices. As noted earlier in this application, Idaho manages and makes elig ibility determinations for both exchange and Medicaid applications through a single state syste m. Since one of the primary goals of the Waiver is to maintain cho ice, simple yet effective chang es will be made to t he user experience for applicants on the system, so that based upon their applicat ion information (e.g., income, family size, etc.), they will receive clear instructions about the cov erage options available to them. Inherent in the word \"choice\" is the concept that an active, ed ucated role is being taken by the individual, bringing into thoughtful consideration what options will work best for that individual's personal situation. After the Wa iver is approved and once new coverage options are made available to Idahoans, individuals in the affected 100% to 138% FPL income bracket who are currently covered by an exchange plan will be proactively ident ified by Your Heal th Idaho and the Department of Health and Welfare . All identified individuals wi ll be notified of the changes and provided an opportunity to make coverage adjustments or to rema in on their Your Health Idaho Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appli cation - Coverage Choice 17 plan. In addition, the agencies wi ll provide public notice to t he general Idaho population about the new coverage choices once they b ecome available, so that new po tential applicants in this income group will also be made aware of their coverage options. On an ongoing basis, Your Health Idaho and the Department of He alth and Welfare will continue to ensure all applicants ha ve access to easy to understand informa tion on their coverage options in order to enable full understandin g of the impact of their cover age selection. Further, individuals will be educated that they are not locked into their exchange p lan selection an d may choose to participate in Medicaid at any time during the plan year. A flo wchart of the application process, noting educational and notification touchpoints, is shown below . Proposed User Experience for Idaho Coverage Choice Selection The State of Idaho is already fully responsible for determinin g all tax credit eligibility, and, therefore, the implementation of this Waiver would be the full responsibility of the state. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver will be implemented through operational system changes at the IDHW, which currently processes all AP TC applications. The nominal re quired changes in that one eligibility system would cascade through the other relevant sys tems of Your Health Idaho and Consumer goes online or meets with an assister to apply on the State Based Exchange <100% FPL 100% 400% FPL 100% - 138% FPL >138% - 400% FPL Consumer is notified they are eligible for Medicaid coverage and then receive Medicaid welcome materials per the normal enrollment process. Consumer is notified they are eligible for Your Health Idaho covera ge Consumer is notified they are eligible for APTC. To effectuate, they are instructed to complete their application on Y our Health Idaho. Consumers at this income bracket will also be notified that by electing this APTC, they are agreeing that they will not be eligible for Medicaid. If the consumer prefers to enroll in Medicaid, they may do so through multiple mediums (i.e. phone, internet, etc.). The notice will make clear that the consumer's Medicaid eligibility is already confirmed and there is no need to reapply. Consumer is notified they are eligible for APTC. To effectuate, they are instructed to complete their application on Your Health Idaho. Applicants will have access to detailed information showing comparisons between Medicaid and Your Health Idaho plan benefits, features, costs, etc. The goal is to provide all Your Health Idaho applicants with the same initial shopping experience, to make the consumer's choices clear and avoid setting up a confusing twotiered system. Incomespecific results and notices would then populate based on the consumer's application information. To assure Medicaid eligible applicants fully understand their coverage choices and are empowered to make informed decisions, clear and easily understood notice language about those choices will be provided before the consumer selects between SBE or Medicaid coverage. Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 18 insurers without additional comp lex programming required. No ne w state program or board would be needed. Beyond the legislation authorizing this Waiver, the IDHW may have administrative rule changes that will requ ire further approval. The proposed timeline for full im plementation of the Idaho Cove rage Choice Waiver is September 30, 2019, so that changes can be put in place and made operatio nal before the fa ll open enrollment occurs for Your Health Idaho. T his timeline will allow Idahoan 's to make coverage choices during open enrollment. However, recogn izing that this critical date m ay not provide adequate time for federal waiver approval, an alter native proposed timeline is al so supplied that would allow for full implementation of the Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver by January 1 , 2020, the proposed effective date of Medicaid expansion. Dependent upon the timing of the Wa iver approval, both proposed implementation timelines would a llow for affected enrollees to consider their coverage choices and make an informed decis ion for their 2020 coverage. Further, ea ch of the proposed timelines are subject to change, as the exact dates may need to adjust as the process continues. TIMELINE: WAIVER APPROVAL BEFORE OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR PLAN YEAR 2020 September 2019 CMS grants Ida ho Coverage Choice Waiver. October 2019 Your Health Idaho eligibility sy stem updates finalized to opera tionalize the Waiver for 2020 open enrollment period determinations. November 1 to December 15, 2019 Open enrollment for plan year 20 20. Individuals applying for co verage with income between 100138% FPL will continue to be permitted to enroll in Your Health Idaho healt h plans with APTC eligibility, and will be notified of additional Medi caid coverage option. January 2020 Health coverage and APTC payments begin for new plan year, and individuals with income between 100138% FPL may retain exchang e coverage, regardless of M edicaid eligibility. TIMELINE: WAIVER APPROVAL AFTER OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR PLAN YEAR 2020 November 1 to December 15, 2019 Open enrollment for plan year 2020 based on current eligibility processes and systems. December 31, 2019 CMS grants Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver. January 1, 2020 Health coverage and APTC payments begin for new plan year. Your Health Idaho eligibility sy stem updates finalized per Waiv er. January 2020 Individuals with income between 100138% FPL are identified and advised of the newly available additional Medicaid coverage opt ion through a special notice. REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES In accordance with 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(4)(vi), the IDOI will sub mit quarterly, annual and cumulative targets for the scope of coverage req uirements, the affordability requirement, the comprehensive requirement, and th e federal defici t requirement. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver is not expected to result in a ny measurable changes to comprehensiveness, affordability , or scope of coverage. However , the IDOI will continue to closely Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 19 monitor each of these guardrails to ensure that the Waiver does not result in any unintended consequences. Idaho will report o n a quarterly basis the PMPM p remium for ACAcompliant plans in the individual market, as we ll as the individual market enro llment for both on and off exchange plans in order to monitor the Waiver impact. The Waiver is expected to result in reduced federal expenditure s. It is anticipated that some individuals with higher morbidit y in the targeted income bracke t may choose to enroll in Medicaid rather than the exchan ge products as a result of the QHP premiu m and cost sharing requirements. As a result, the Waiver may marg inally reduce overall premiums in the individual health insurance market. IDOI will report each qu arter on enrollment and the APT C expended on Idaho residents who enroll through the state's ex change, Your Health Idaho. As detailed in Table 6, enrollment and expenditure detail in the report will be broken out to specific ally identify the im pact of enrollment and expenditure changes for the 100% to 138% FPL income bracket . Table 6: Proposed Table for Reporting Enrollment & Expenditure Data 2020 APTC Enrollment and Expenditures Q1 Idaho Section 1332 Waiver Appl ication - Coverage Choice 20 In addition to tracking the enro llment and expenditure data on a quarterly, annual and cumulative basis, Idaho proposes to include the following information in t he reports: Evidence of compliance with publ ic forum requirements, includin g date, time, place, description of attendees, the subs tance of any public comments, and Idaho's response. Information about any challenges Idaho may face in implementing and sustaining the Waiver program and its plan to address the challenges. A description of any substantive changes in Idaho's insurance m arket. Any other information consistent with the terms and condition i n Idaho's approved Waiver. The first quarterly report will be submitted on or about June 1 , 2020 and will report 2020 enrollment and cost information a s of the first quarter of 2020 (through March 31, 2020).

AND 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 1 July 8, 2019 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Milliman, Inc. (Milliman) has been retained by the State of Ida ho to provide actuarial and consulting services related to its proposed Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver (Choice Waiver). The Choi ce Waiver is intended to maintain access to private health insurance coverage and federal premium assistance offere d through Your Health Idaho (YHI) for qualifying individuals with income between 100% and 138% of the federal po verty level (FPL). Without the Choice Waiver, approximately 18,000 Idahoans c urrently insured through a quali fied health plan (QHP) purchased on YHI would become eligible for Medicaid (and no longer qualify for federal premiu m assistance) on January 1, 2020 as part of the State's Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Sta te is seeking a Section 1332 waiver to preserve access to QHP coverage and federal premi um assistance for these YHI pa rticipants, regardless of Medicaid expansion. This report provides the required actuarial analysis, certifica tion, and economic analyses supporting the State's determination that the Choice Wai ver meets the requirements for a Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver. Our certification o f the 1332 waiver is de pendent upon the Stat e's interpretation of Section 1332 regulations and guidance, as well as its interpretation of the allowable baseline and 'wi th waiver' scenarios under this waiver. Future guidance from federal agencies may require a revision to this report and its certification. Section 1332 waiver Legislation authorizing the Choice Waiver was signed on April 9 , 2019 by Governor Brad Little. This waiver application seeks to waive a specific provision in Section 36B of the Inter nal Revenue Code related to eligibility for federal subsidies for qualified health plans. Specifically, 26 U.S. Code \u00a7 36B(c )(2)(B) provides that individuals are not eligible for federal subsidies if the individual is eligible for other qualifying co verage, including Medicaid. By waiving this provision, individu als with income between 100% and 138% FPL will be able to maintain APTCs, and by extension the health coverage they have been receiving through YHI. Persons with income between 100% an d 138% FPL will also have the choice of enrolling in Medicaid. 1332 waiver guardrails For the Choice Waiver to meet t he federal requirements for a 13 32 waiver, it must meet the following standards: Scope of Coverage : The 1332 waiver must provide health insurance to at least as many people as would be projected under the status-quo ACA (without waiver). Affordability : The 1332 waiver must provide coverage and cost sharing protec tions against excessive out-of-pocket spending that are at least as affordable as would be projected without the waiver. Comprehensiveness : The 1332 waiver must provide coverage at least as comprehensi ve (as defined by the ACA's essential health benefits) as would be projected without the wa iver. Deficit Neutrality : The 1332 waiver must be deficit neutral to the federal govern ment as would be projected without the waiver Note, under October 2018 guidance, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of the Treasury (Treasury) indicated the affordability and comprehensiveness gu ardrails would be met if access to coverage that is as affordable and comprehensive as coverage forecasted to have bee n available in the absence of the waiver is projected to be available to a comparable numbe r of people under the waiver.1 The Choice Waiver maintains access to APTC and QHP coverage for this income cohort, but also allows these persons to elect to enroll in Medicaid coverage. While there is significan t uncertainty regarding the distribution of enrollment between Medicaid and QHP coverage, fewer APTC enrollees are estimated u nder the Choice Waiver as a portion of current QHP enrollees are anticipated to enr oll in Medicaid coverage. The S tate of Idaho is not seeking federal pass-through funding under this waiver. 1 https://s3.amazonaws.c om/public-inspection. federalregister.gov/ 2018-23182.pdf 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 2 July 8, 2019 It should be stressed that these requirements are in relation t o scope of coverage, affordability, comprehensiveness, and deficit neutrality without the wa iver. For example, a 1332 waiv er is not required to result in more insured individuals relati ve to a period before its implementa tion. Rather, it must be estim ated to ensure at least as many insured individuals are covered during the projection period rel ative to if the 1332 waiver was not implemented. Our analysis indicates that Idaho' s 1332 waiver, the Choice Wai ver, meets all of the federal r equirements cited above. This assessment reflects the State's interpretation that without the waiver, persons with income between 100% and 138% FPL would have access to QHP coverage offe red through YHI. Impact of other program changes on assessment of waiver proposal Per CMS and Treasury guidance, future proposed changes to the M edicaid state plan that are subject to federal approval are not factored into the asse ssment, and, therefore, are not w ithin the scope of this Waiver application.2 As such, any status quo projection in this report excludes Medicaid expansio n. However, since the Choice Waiver would not be necessary without Medicaid expansion, our analysis reflected in the \"with waiver\" illustrations contained in this report includes the impact of Medicaid expansion as well. Specifically, when estima ting the impact of the Choice Waiver, we also include the impact of the planned Medicaid expansion for persons with incom e between 100% and 138% FPL population. To the extent future guidance from federal agencies requires a modification t o these assumptions, our assessment of the Choice Waiver's compliance with the 1332 waiver guardrails will need to be re-e valuated. Scope of Coverage During the course of the five-year initial waiver period and th e ten-year projection period, we estimate the Choice Waiver will result in a stable nu mber of insured Idahoans. Without the waiver, individual market coverage is estimated to decline during the first five years of the projection period (primarily as a result of decline in non-ACA compliant c overage, which is estimate d to also occur under the waiver), while slightly increasing in the second half of the pr ojection period as a result of estimated population growth. Under the Choice Waiver, indivi dual market coverage is estimat ed to decline slightly furt her relative to without the waiver as a portion of the 100% to 138% FPL QHP population is a ssumed to transition to Medicaid coverage. The Choice Waiver is not estimated to materially change the number of Idahoans that purchase non-group coverage that have income above 138% FPL. We do not estimate the Choice Wai ver having any material impact s to the number of Idahoans covered under employer- sponsored plans, Medicaid (with the exception of QHP enrollees with income between 100% and 138% FPL), Medicare, or other public programs. Figure 1 illustrates estimated non-group market group enrollment under the Choice Waiver relative to if the program was not implemented, as well as the estimated number of Idahoans expected to transition to Medicaid coverage under the waiver. As shown in Figure 1 on the followin g page, the enrollment changes in the individual market under the waiver are assumed to occur entirely from persons tra nsitioning from QHP to Medicaid coverage. On a net basis, the number of insured Idahoans i s not estimated to change as a result of the Choice Waiver. Our assumptions for the number of Idahoans electing to transiti on to Medicaid coverage have been based on discussions with Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Idaho Departmen t of Insurance (IDOI) personnel. We believe these assumptions are reasonable, while at the same time, recognizing significant uncertainty exists regarding the distribution of future health insurance enrollment between Medicaid and QHP cov erage for the population with income between 100% and 138% FPL. 2 See 83 Fed. Reg. 53575, (Oct. 2018); available at and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 3 July 8, 2019 Figure 1 Idaho Department of Insurance Estimated Impacts to Health Insurance Coverage from Coverage Ch oice Waiver Individuals Insured in Non-Group Market Medicaid Expansion (Former QHP) Calendar Year Without 1332 Waiver With 1332 Waiver Waiver Change 2019 112,000 112,000 - 0 2020 108,000 106,000 (2,000) 2,000 2021 102,000 100,000 (2,000) 2,000 2022 103,000 100,000 (3,000) 3,000 2023 103,000 100,000 (3,000) 3,000 2024 104,000 100,000 (4,000) 4,000 2025 104,000 100,000 (4,000) 4,000 2026 105,000 100,000 (5,000) 5,000 2027 106,000 101,000 (6,000) 6,000 Note: Values are rounded. Transitions from QHP to Medicaid coverage are estimated to occu r incrementally across the t en-year projection period. Actual Medicaid enrollment is certain to differ from the estima tes illustrated in Figure 1. Out-of-pocket premium and cost sharing requirements for QHP coverage and provider access diffe rences between Medicaid and QHP coverage are two primary factors that m ay influence the division of health insur ance coverage for Idahoans with income between 100% and 138% FPL. The Choice Waiver, in conjunction with Medicaid expansion, is e stimated to reduce QHP premium rates between (1%) and (4%) across the projection period. APTC-eligible population . Because the ACA's APTC structure caps household out-of-pocket premium expenses, we estimate insignificant chang es in the affordability of cover age for the APTC-eligible population. For the population with income above 138% FPL, we estimate slight incre ases in APTC enrollment after 2019, with or without the Choice Waiver, due to population growth. Non-APTC eligible population . While the Choice Waiver is estimated to slightly lower premiu m rates for the non- APTC eligible population, we do not believe the projected premi um rate changes are signi ficant enough to have a measurable effect on future market enrollment. Affordability The Choice Waiver is not estimated to impact premium rates for employer-sponsored insurance, nor change affordability for public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. For the non-group market, the Choice Waiver and Medicaid expans ion is estimated to reduce Silver benchmark premium rates by approximately 1% to 4% (relative to without the waiver ) over the ten-year projection period. As a portion of the current QHP population with income between 100% and 138% is ant icipated to transition to Medicaid coverage, this will reduce the number of Silver plan enrollees receiving a 94% cost sharing reduction (CSR) plan. With the federal government no longer funding CSR payments directly, Idaho insurers have bu ilt the cost of the enhanced CSR plan designs into the premium for Silver-level coverage offered through YHI. The magn itude of \"Silver loading\" for CSR payments will decrease under the waiver as fewer individuals with Silver QHP coverage will qualify for enhanc ed CSR plan designs. As a result of the Choice Waiver and Medicaid expansion, we est imate that morbidity am ong the QHP population will improve. It is assumed that persons with known healthcare cost s may be more likely to transition to Medicaid due to its lower out-of-pocket costs. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 4 July 8, 2019 Under the ACA's premium assist ance program, qualifying househol ds with income between 100% and 400% FPL have out- of-pocket premium expenses capped to a specified percent of inc ome. In 2019, we estimate approximately 75% of Idahoans purchasing coverage in the ACA-compliant individual market will receive federal premium assistance. To a large degree, we estimate the vast majority of individuals receiving premium assistance without the waiver will also receive premium assistance under the Choice Waiver. For these individuals, the small amount of premium savings will accrue to the federal government, as it reduces the amount of premium assistance nece ssary to ensure the out-of-pocket cost of coverage does not exceed the maximum specified by the ACA. It is possible tha t some young adults and other persons with income approaching 400% FPL receiving premium assistance without the w aiver will see out-of-pocket premiums fall below the maximum specified by the ACA under the Choice Waiver. In these cases, only partial premium savings accrue to the federal government, while the consumer a lso directly benefits from the premium reduction. For households not eligible for premium assistance, the full am ount of premium rate reduction will be realized under the Choice Waiver, with the federal government not accruing any sav ings. Figure 2 illustrates premium rate reductions for a 21- year old and a 64-year old for the second lowest cost Silver pl an (the benchmark plan that is used to determine available premium assistance). The magnitu de of premium rate reductions i s estimated to grow slightly over the ten-year projection period as a result of additional QHP enrollees transitioning to Medicaid (with incremental reductions in Silver loading3 and improved morbidity for the resi dual individual market risk pool ). Figure 2 Idaho Department of Insurance Coverage Choice Waiver Changes in Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan Monthly Premium from 1332 Waiver Implementation 21-Year Old Monthly Premium 64-Year Old Monthly Premium Calendar Year Without 1332 waiver With 1332 waiver Change Without 1332 waiver rounded. 2. Values do not reflect availabl e premium assistance for quali fying individuals. 3. Premiums are for non-tobacco user and assume federal default 3:1 age rating. 4. The magnitude of premium rate decreases is estimated to be l ower for off-exchange and non-S ilver insurance plan designs. 5. Premium savings would be realized by consumers not qualifyi ng for federal premium assistance and the federal government (through lower premium assistance expenditures). Based on the above summary of our analysis, we believe the Choi ce Waiver meets the affordab ility requirement for federal approval of a 1332 waiver. 3 See https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resour ces/Regulations-and-Guidance/Do wnloads/Offering-plans-not-QHPs-without-CSR-loading.pdf for additional background. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 5 July 8, 2019 Comprehensiveness The Choice Waiver meets the co mprehensiveness requirement for a 1332 waiver. This waiver makes no change to insurer benefit requirements for plans offered in Idaho's health insura nce markets as Idaho does not propose to waive any of the requirements concerning the Ess ential Health Benefits, and the waiver will not result in individuals losing coverage or moving to less comprehensive coverage. Therefore, the focus of the act uarial analysis was related to coverage and affordability requirements under the Choice Wai ver, as presented above and di scussed in greater deta il later in this report. By maintaining access to comprehensive and affordable ACA-compl iant insurance coverage for the population with income between 100% and 138% FPL, we believe the Choice Waiver meets t he federal government's guardrail requirements outlined in its October 2018 guidance. Deficit Neutrality A 1332 waiver application must dem onstrate it will not increase the federal deficit. By reducing non-group premiums, the Choice Waiver is estimated to result in federal savings on prem ium assistance provided through YHI for the population qualifying for federal APTCs. Additionally, the Choice Waiver i s estimated to reduce the number of persons receiving an APTC (through an expansion of health insurance coverage choice) . The State will not be seeking federal pass-through funding under the Choice Waiver. Figure 3 illustrates estimated changes in federal APTC expenditures for QHP enrollees during the ten-year projection period. Approximately 80% of the APTC savings are the result of QHP enrollees with income between 100% and 138% FPL transitioning to Medicaid. The remain der of the APTC savings is attributable to the population with income between 139% and 400% FPL, as premium rate decrease s for the second-lowest cost Silver plan are projected to reduce federal premium assistance expenditures. APTC expendi ture changes by income level are provided in Figure 31. Figure 3 Idaho Department of Insurance Estimated Changes in Federal APTC Expenditures ($ Millions) Coverage Choice Waiver Calendar Year APTC Expenditures Without Waiver APTC Expenditures with Waiver Net Change in Federal Expenditures 2019 To the extent that the number o f persons transitioning to Medic aid under the waiver is greater than the estimates assumed in this report, additional APTCs s avings are projected to occur relative to without the waiver. Sensitivity of Results It should be noted that there is s ignificant uncertainty surrou nding future enrollment and premiums in health insurance programs, particularly the individual market. Differences betwe en our projections and actual amounts depend on the extent to which future experience conforms to the assumptions made for this analysis. It is certain that actual experience will not conform exactly to the assumptions used in this analysis. Actua l amounts will differ from pro jected amounts to the extent that actual experience deviate s from expected experience. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 6 July 8, 2019 Actual enrollment and premium c hanges may vary for several reas ons, including but not limited to: Consumer behavior as a result o f the individual mandate being repealed beginning for the 2019 coverage year Consumer preferences for Medicaid vs. private health insurance coverage Direct federal funding of cost s haring reduction (CSR) payment s Health care inflation The actuarial and economic analys es presented in this report so lely reflect the estimated in cremental impact of the Choice Waiver. Other current or pending state or federal policy change s may impact actual amounts presented in this report. We specifically note that our p rojections of enrollment and pre mium rates in the individual market assume CSR variants continue and insurer pricing a ssumptions do not materially devi ate from 2019 assumptions. In Idaho, insurance carriers were allowed to increase Silver premiums in 2018 in response to the federal government eliminating the CSR payments as of October 2017.4 To the extent that direct CSR payments are reinstated, our ana lysis will need to be updated. To the extent judicial, legislative, or regul atory changes are made to the AC A or state-based insurance regu lations, the values presented in this report may be impacted by a significant degree. 4 https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/ 2017/10/12/trump-administration- takes-action-abide-law-constitution-discontinue-csr-payments.ht ml Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 7 July 8, 2019 SECTION I. ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS This section provides the requir ed actuarial analysis for Idaho 's Section 1332 Waiver application. The appendix of this report contains the actuaria l certification for the 1332 waiver. A description of the actuarial an alysis meeting the requirement s under 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(4)(i) and other applicable information as requested in the Checklist for Section 1332 Waiv er Applications has been prov ided in this section. For purposes of this analysis, cale ndar year 2019 s erves as the bas eline year for the ten-ye ar required projections. As discussed in the Assumptions and Methodology section of this report, we utilized a combination of census bureau survey and projection data, YHI enrollm ent and APTC data, publicly ava ilable health insurance enrollment and premium data, modeling of the ACA's premium a ssistance structure, estimated M edicaid expansion enrollment and costs, and proprietary data to model the estimated impact of the Choice Waiver during the ten-year projection period. Our analysis reflects the estimated demographics of Idahoans during the projection period and models insurance purchasing behavior based on changes in premium rates and federal premium subsidies. Our mod eling allows for the summarization of projected enrollment and premium informati on by age, gender, health statu s, household income, and insurance market. Prior to performing any projections, we calibrated our projecti on model's census, premium, claims expense, and other assumptions to reflect Idaho's insurance markets. As the Choice Waiver is estimated to primarily impact Idaho's individual health insurance market, the focus of our modeling efforts was on impacts to this market under both the status-quo ACA and the 1332 Waiver. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 8 July 8, 2019 1. PROJECTED CHOICE WAIVER POPULATION Figure 4 illustrates the estima ted number of Idahoans enrolled in ACA compliant and Medicaid expansion coverage under the Choice Waiver during the 2019 baseline year and ten-year pr ojection period. Enrollment has been separately estimated for the following population segments: QHP Choice Waiver (100% to 138% FPL) : This column represents individuals that are expected to maint ain access to QHP coverage and federal premium assistance under the Choice Waiver. In the 2019 baseline year, 18,600 Idahoans with income between 100% and 138% are estimated to hav e enrolled in QHP coverage through YHI. During the course of the ten-year projection period, QHP enroll ment from this population is estimated to slowly decline because of enrollment churn (an increasing proportion o f 2019 QHP enrollees are estimated to qualify for other forms of health insurance each year, such as employer-spo nsored or Medicare coverage). Without the waiver, these individuals would no longer be eligible for premi um assistance under Medicaid expansion (assumed to begin January 1, 2020) and would transition to Medicaid cove rage. Other ACA Compliant Individual Market Enrollment : This column reflects individuals with income above 138% FPL who are estimated to enroll in QHP coverage within YHI or purch ase ACA compliant cover age outside the state exchange. Other ACA compliant enrollment is not estimated to be materially affected by the Choice Waiver. Enrollment over the ten-year pro jection period is estimated to slowly increase with overall population growth. Total ACA Compliant Enrollment : This column equals the sum of QHP Choice Waiver and Other ACA Compliant individual market enrollment. Opt-Out QHP Medicaid Expansion (100% to 138% FPL) : This column represents individuals that are expected to opt-out of QHP coverage and enro ll in Medicaid under the state' s Medicaid expansion. In the 2019 baseline year, these individuals are enrolled in QHP coverage. Note, enrollmen t excludes individuals who are expected to not purchase QHP coverage in the abs ence of Medica id expansion. Note, Figure 4 excludes enrollm ent for persons wit h non-ACA com pliant coverage in the individual market.

ESTIMATED PREMIUM IMPACT FROM 1332 WAIVER Figure 5 illustrates the estima ted claims expense per member pe r month (PMPM), non-claims expense PMPM, composite premium PMPM and corresponding medical loss ratio (MLR), withou t adjustment for taxes and assessments or quality improvement expenses, under both the status-quo AC A and the Cho ice Waiver for the ACA-compliant risk pool. Our modeling estimates the ACA-compliant individual market's m orbidity will be slightly improved by higher cost individuals with income between 100% and 138% FPL electing to e nroll in Medicaid due to i ts lower out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, this enrollment migration will reduce the number of Silver plan enrollees receiving a 94% cost sharing reduction (CSR) plan. With the f ederal government no longer fun ding CSR payments directly, Idaho insurers have built the cost of the enhanced CSR plan designs into the premiu m for Silver-level coverage offered through YHI. The magnitude of \"Silver loading\" for CSR payments will decreas e under the waiver as fewer individuals with Silver QHP coverage will qualify for enhanced CSR plan designs. Composite premium PMPMs are also estimated to decline under th e waiver as a result of a lower proportion of YHI enrollees choosing Silver coverage. Approximately 80% of QH P enrollees with income between 100% and 138% FPL that are expected to tr ansition to Medicaid under the waiver are assumed to have Silver coverage.

Values have been rounded. 2. MLR estimates have not been adjusted for fees and taxes or q uality improvement expenses. 3. Values exclude non-ACA compliant coverage. There is significant uncertainty regarding insurer pricing assu mptions with or without the implementation of the 1332 waiver. Insurer competition, regulatory changes, and other unknown fact ors may result in actual claims and non-claims expenses varying materially from the above values. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 10 July 8, 2019 3. COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS As required under 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(3)(iv)(C), a State's propo sed waiver must provide coverage to at least a comparable number of its residents as the provisions of Title I of the ACA . Under Idaho's 1332 waiver, we expect the number of Idahoans with health insurance coverage will remain stable. The number o f Idahoans with health insurance coverage may increase under the waiver to the extent a subset of current QHP enrollee s with income between 100% and 138% FPL would opt to not enroll in Medicaid covera ge in the absence of the waiver. The following paragraphs detail 2019 (baseline year) health ins urance coverage in the non-group market, as well as estimated coverage changes duri ng the ten-year projection perio d, 2020 through 2029. A. NON-GROUP MARKET ENRO LLEES BY HOUSEHOLD INCOME Figure 6 illustrates estimated non-group market enrollment in t housands under the status-quo AC A (without waiver) during the baseline year (2019), and the projection period (2020 throu gh 2029) by household income, as measured as a percentage of the FPL. Enrollment figures include all comprehensive non-gr oup coverage, including transitional and grandfathered coverage. Figure 6 Idaho Department of Insurance Coverage Choice Waiver Estimated Non-Group Market Enrollees by Household Income: 2019 through 2029 (Thousands) Without Waiver Income Level % of FPL 2019 2020 2021 2022 <100% 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 >=100% to <=150% 24 24 24 24 25 25 25 26 26 26 26 >150% to <=200% 18 19 19 19 19 20 20 20 20 21 21 >200% to <=250% 15 15 16 16 16 16 17 17 17 17 17 >250% to <=300% 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 >300% to <=400% 9 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 10 10 >400% 37 32 25 25 25 24 24 23 23 23 23 Total Individual 112 108 102 103 103 104 104 105 106 107 108 Notes: 1. Values are rounded to the nearest thousand. 2. Total values are rounded separately. As shown in Figure 6, the greate st concentration of non-group m arket enrollment in the 2019 baseline year and ten-year projection period has household income ranging from 100% to 250 % FPL, representing more than half of market enrollment in each year. It is assumed that the vast majority of these hou seholds are receiving federal premium assistance to purchase health insurance coverage throug h YHI. The structure of the ACA 's premium subsidy has resulted in minimal out-of-pocket premium rate increases for households purchasing coverage with federal premium assistance through YHI. We expect out- of-pocket premium rates for the APTC-eligible population will n ot materially change during the ten-year projection period, resulting in steady APTC-eligib le enrollment, with slight incre ases driven by population growth. The population with household income above 400% FPL or below 10 0% FPL (with the exception of lawfully present non- citizens) is not eligible for premium assistance under the ACA. As a result of additional premium rate increases, and the phase-out of non-ACA coverage assumed to occur in 2021, we esti mate the number of individuals purchasing coverage in the non-group market without APT C declines during the ten-year projection period. At the end of 2020, we assume t ransitional/grandfathered cover age will end, with a portion of these individuals electing to become uninsured in 2021. From 2021 through the end of the projection period, we estimat e a slow erosion of enrol lment from the population not qualifying for premium assistance. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 11 July 8, 2019 Figure 7 illustrates estimated non-group market enrollment in t housands under the 1332 waiver (with waiver) during the baseline year (2019), and projection period (2020 through 2029) . Additionally, the figure illustrates estimated Medicaid expansion enrollment for individuals with income between 100% a nd 138% FPL who would have otherwise enrolled in QHP coverage absence the waiver. Note, other Medicaid expansion enrollment, which is not estimat ed to be impacted by the Choice Waiver, has been excluded from Figure 7. Enrollment figur es include all comprehensive non -group coverage, including tr ansitional and grandfathered coverage.

Figure 8 illustrates the estimated net non-group market and Med icaid expansion enrollment change resulting from the implementation of the 1332 waiver from 2020 through 2029. As a result of the Medicaid expansion, we estimate enrollment declines within Idaho's individual market and corresponding inc reases to Medicaid coverage. E nrollment figures include all comprehensive non-group coverage, including transitional an d grandfathered coverage. Medicaid expansion reflects only enrollment for individuals with income between 100% and 13 8% FPL who would have otherwise enrolled in QHP coverage absent the waiver.

As observed in Figure 8, overall health insurance coverage enro llment is estimated to remain stable under the waiver. We estimate the waiver results in a transition from QHP to Medicai d expansion coverage for some persons with household income between 100% and 138% FPL.

NON-GROUP MARKET ENROLLMENT BY PREMIUM TAX CREDIT ELIGIBILIT Y Figures 9, 10, and 11 illustrate the impact to non-group market enrollment resulting from the Choice Waiver based on enrollee APTC eligibility status with waiver, without waiver, a nd the net change. Under the ACA, qualifying households with income between 100%5 and 400% of the FPL are eligible for an APTC that may be used to purchase health insurance coverage through YHI.

Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 14 July 8, 2019 Nearly two-thirds of individual market enrollees are expected t o receive an APTC to purchase health insurance coverage during the 2019 baseline year. As a result of a portion of the 100% to 138% FPL population transitioning to Medicaid coverage, APTC enrollees are est imated to represent a lower pro portion of the residual individual market during the projection period. Without the waiver (Figure 11), A PTC eligibility increases to 79% (85/108) of tota l individual mar ket enrollment by 2029. With the waiver (Figure 12), t he percentage of market enrollee s estimated to receive an APTC is slightly reduced to approximately 77% (79/102) o f total market enrollment in 202 9. The enrollment decreases illustrated from 2019 to 2020 reflect the impact of transitional coverage assumed to end on December 31, 2020. Changes to t he State's transitional coverage policy may impact individual market enrollment during the course of the projection period. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 15 July 8, 2019 C. NON-GROUP MARKET ENROLLMENT BY METALLIC LEVEL Figures 12, 13, and 14 illustrate the estimated impact to non-g roup market enrollment by plan level with waiver, without waiver, and the net change. Under the ACA, households may purch ase a non-group plan in one of four metallic tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum.6 However, insurers participating in Idaho's non-group market do not currently offer Platinum level coverage. Catastrophic plans are available for i ndividuals under 30 or persons qualifying for an unaffordabilit y or hardship exemption. Additional ly, there is a relatively smal l portion of the non-group market that has maintained grandfathered or trans itional coverage that was first purchased prior to the ACA's reformed rating rules implemented in 2014. Based on discussions with the IDOI, we assumed transition al coverage will end and grandfathered coverage would phase-out after 2020.

As shown in Figure 14, the majority of individual market enroll ment decreases resulting from the waiver are estimated to come from the Silver coverage tier, as individuals with income between 100% and 150% predominately enroll in Silver coverage to have access to the 94% CSR plan design.7 7 Note, native Americans with bel ow 300% FPL receive a 100% CSR plan design regardless of c overage tier selected.

NON-GROUP MARKET ENROLLMENT BY HEALTH STATUS This section provides the estima ted impact to non-group market enrollment by health status from the 1332 waiver. As discussed in the methodology section of this report, health sta tus is defined based on an individual's estimated risk score relativity. Figure 18 illustrates the estimated change in non-g roup market morbidity under the status-quo ACA (without waiver) and under the Choice Wai ver during the baseline year (2 019), and projection period (2020 through 2029). Figure 18 Idaho Department of Insurance Coverage Choice Waiver Estimated Non-Group Market Enrollees Morbidity: 2019 through 20 29 2019 2022 Choice Waiver is estimated to have a higher likelihood o f transitioning higher morbidity individuals to Medicaid, the morbidity of the non-group risk pool is estimated to improve un der the waiver. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 20 July 8, 2019 4. AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS As required under 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(3)(iv)(B), a state's propo sed 1332 waiver must provide coverage and cost sharing protections against excessive out-of-pocket spending that are a t least as affordable under Title I of the ACA. As described in CMS-9936-N, increasing the nu mber of state residents with la rge health care spending burdens relative to their incomes would result in a waiver proposal failing to meet the affordabi lity requirement of the 1332 waiver application.8 Additionally, regulations state an evaluation of the affordability requiremen t will take into account the impact of the waiver proposal to \"vulnerable residents, including low-income individuals, elderl y individuals, and those with serious health issues or who have a greater risk of developing serious health issues\". The Choice Waiver is estimated to result is premium rate decrea ses of approximately (1%) to ( 4%) (relative to without the waiver). This decrease is driven by two factors: Reduced Silver CSR Loading : As a portion of the current QHP population with income betwee n 100% and 138% is anticipated to transition to Medicaid coverage, this will reduc e the number of Silver plan enrollees receiving a 94% cost sharing reduction (CSR) plan. W ith the federal government no lo nger funding CSR payments directly, Idaho insurers have built the cost of the enhanced CS R plan designs into the premiu m for Silver-level coverage offered through YHI. The magnitude of \"Silver loading\" for CSR payments is estimated to decrease under the waiver as fewer individuals with Silver QHP coverage will qualify fo r enhanced CSR plan designs. Individual market morbidity : We estimate that morbidity a mong the QHP population will impr ove. It is assumed that persons with known healthcare costs may be more likely to transition to Medicaid due to its low er out-of-pocket costs. While the overall premium rate impacts from the Choice Waiver a re minimal, the following directional impacts are estimated to be experienced by d ifferent cohorts of Idaho's individual he alth insurance market. For the majority of the existing APTC-eligible population, the 1332 waiver will not impact out-of-pocket premium costs for the second-lowest cost Silver plan (subsidy benchmark plan). These households will continue to pay up to a maximum percentage of their household income for the subsi dy benchmark plan. A very small portion of consumers receiving an APTC in the abs ence of the Choice Waiver may no longer be eligible for the subsidy after the implementation of the Choice Waiver, due to the premium expense not exceeding the maximum percentage of household income as defined under the ACA. These consumers will realize out-of- pocket premium savings as a re sult of the Choice Waiver. For consumers purchasing coverage through YHI without an APTC or outside YHI, premium savings will be realized from the Choice Waiver. For persons qualifying for APTC that are purchasing Bronze lev el coverage, it is possible that out-of-pocket premiums may increase as a result of the Choice Waiver. As the Choice Waiver is estimated to reduce the dollar amount of the APTC for qualifying individuals, the available fi nancial assistance that can be applied to the purchase of Bronze level coverage is reduced. Based on 2019 enrollment d ata provided by IDOI, and adjusting for effectuated enrollment assumptions, approximately 30,000 Idahoa ns are purchasing Bronze coverage with an APTC. For low income indivi duals, the ACA's subs idy structure may cr eate the availability of a $0 out-of-pocket premium for Bronze coverage. Due to the federal government no longer ma king direct CSR payments to insurers, the premium gap between Bronze and Silver coverage significantly wi dened, with average Bronze premium rates increasing by less than 10% relat ive to approximately 40% for S ilver plans in 2018. 9 In 2019, we estimate a significant portion of persons with income under 200% FPL quali fying for premium assistance are eligible to purchase a $0 Bronze plan.10 8 See https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ FR-2015-12-16/pdf/2015-31563.pdf for more information. 9 See https://doi.idaho.gov /DisplayPDF?Id=4039 for more information. 10 See https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-premiums-are- changing-in-2018/ for more information. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 21 July 8, 2019 Due to the ACA's permissible 3:1 age rating factor and the dis continuation of federal CSR payments, some older adults are eligible for a $0 Bronze plan at income levels above 300% FPL. As the Choice Waiver is estimated to reduce premiums, it is likely the number of marketplace enrolle es qualifying for a $0 Bronze plan will decrease to a very small degree relati ve to without the waiver. For enrollees with income under 200% FPL, we estimate a large portion of marketplace enrollees will continue to have access to a Bronze plan with $0 out-of-pocket premium. Add itionally, the majority of consumers with income less than 200% FPL are projected to purchase Silver coverage to access plans with reduced cost sharing (CSR variants). Premium savings from the Choice Waiver will vary by allowable r ating factors under the ACA and the APTC structure: age, tobacco-usage, geographic location, plan metallic level (Silver plans are estimated to have the largest premium rate decreases due to less CSR loading), and household income. Enrol lees will realize out-of-pocket premium savings consistent with their demographics as they relate to these factors. The Ch oice Waiver does not make any changes to required insurer plan design, cost sharing limitations, or cost sharing assistan ce in the non-group market. The following sections provide e stimates of changes in market p remiums and APTC amounts resulting from the Choice Waiver. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 22 July 8, 2019 A. NON-GROUP MARKET PER MEMBER PER MONTH PREMIUM Figures 19, 20, and 21 illustrate estimated non-group PMPM prem iums for 2019 and the ten-year projection period without the waiver, under the waiver, and the net change in PMPM premiu ms. We have illustrated premiums separately for ACA- compliant coverage (ACA) and transitional/grandfathered coverag e (Non-ACA). ACA coverage reflects premiums attributable to coverage purchased through YHI, as well as cove rage outside YHI that is compliant with ACA rating rules. Note, drivers of premium rate changes include direct impacts fr om the Choice Waiver, as well as age and plan mix changes. Non-ACA coverage is assumed to end after 2020 under both the wi thout and with waiver scenarios. In projecting premium rates beyond 2020, we have relie d on CMS Office of the Actuary' s National Health Expenditure projections for per capita private health insurance spending (excluding Medigap and Proper ty & Casualty insurance).11 The CMS projections estimate per capita premium an nual premium trends of approximately 5%. Figure 19 Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Coverage Choice Waiver Estimated Non-Group Premium PMPM by Plan Type: 2019 through 202 9 Without Waiver Plan Type 2019 2020 2021 2022 $ 534 $ 557 $ 583 $ 614 $ 647 $ 681 $ 716 $ 749 $ 784 $ 820 Non-ACA $ 258 $ 273 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Composite $ 482 $ 512 $ 557 $ 583 $ 614 $ 647 $ 681 $ 716 $ 749 $ 784 $ 820 Note: Values are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Under the Choice Waiver, we assumed incremental transitions fro m QHP to Medicaid expansion coverage for the population with income between 100% and 138% FPL. In each projection year, there is an incremental premium rate reduction from reduced Silver loading for CSR p ayments, and slightly improved risk pool morbidity. To the extent a full transition from QHP to Medicaid expansion occurred in 2020, the incremental premium rate change from the waiver would be experienced fully in 2020. Conversely, if no trans ition occurred during the proje ction period, we would estimate zero impact to individual market premium rates from the waiver (although actual premiums may reflect insurers assuming transitions would occur).

The above premium rate changes have not been normalized for cha nges in age and metallic plan mix resulting from the Choice Waiver.

NON-GROUP MARKET AGGREGATE PREMIUM The following tables illustrate es timated non-group aggregate p remium for 2019 and the ten-year projection period without the waiver, under the waiver, and the net change in aggregate p remium. We have illustrated premiums separately for ACA- compliant coverage (ACA) and transitional/grandfathered coverag e (Non-ACA). ACA coverage reflects premiums attributable to coverage purchas ed through YHI, as well as cove rage outside YHI that is compli ant with ACA rating rules.

As illustrated in Figure 22, aggregate ACA-compliant premiums i n 2019 are estimated to be $606 million. Non-ACA compliant premiums are estimated to represent less than 10% of 2019 aggregate individual market premiums without the waiver, totaling approximately $43 million in 2019. During the projection period, individual market premium volume is estimated to incr ease to approximately $1.1 billion.

The above figures illustrate a decrease to aggregate ACA premiu ms resulting from the implementation of the Choice Waiver in 2020. This decrease is driven by slightly lower per capita premiums, as well as the transition from ACA-compliant to Medicaid coverage for persons wit h income between 100% and 138% FPL.

Values are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. 2. Premiums reflect non-tobacco user. As shown in Figure 27, each rating area is expected to experien ce a reduction in the premium amount for the subsidy benchmark plan under the \"with waiver\" scenario. We have assume d the baseline premium rates accurately reflect the underlying insured population in each rating region. Therefore, on a PMPM basis, rating areas with higher baseline premiums are estimated to have a greater PMPM reduction relativ e to rating areas with less expense premiums. On a percentage basis, we estimate p remium rate reductions of approx imately (1%) to (4%) resulting from the Choice Waiver and Medicaid expansion for the subsidy benchmark plan. Because of loading for CSR plan designs on Silver exchange plan s, the premium rate change resulting from the waiver will be impacted by the number of persons electing to transition fro m QHP to Medicaid coverage. To the extent no transitions occur, we estimate the waiver will have no impact to individual market premium rates. Conversely, if all QHP enrollees in the 100% to 138% FPL cohort transitioned to Medicaid, we would estimate a larger decrease to Silver marketplace premium rates as significantly fewer persons would qualify for the 94% actuarial value CSR plan variant (which would reduce the amount of loading necessary for insurers to include in Silver e xchange premiums). To the extent direct federal fund ing of CSR payments is restore d, the premium rate estimates in this report would be materially impacted. Direct funding of CSR payments would resu lt in the premium rate chang e estimated under the waiver being driven by individual market risk pool morbidity changes, rather than a combination of morbidity and CSR loading variances. Figure 28 illustrates the sensit ivity of premium rate change es timates based on the number of persons with income between 100% and 138% FPL transitioning to Medicaid from QHP coverage. In addition to the without waiver and with waiver premium rate estimates, the fi gure also provides the estimated premium rates under a \"full transition\" scenario (all QHP enrollees in the 100% to 138% F PL cohort transition to Medicaid ).

T he additional premium rate redu ction is attributable to further reduction in Silver loading for CSR costs and improved risk pool morbidity. The full transi tion scenario would also result in greater reductions in federal premium assistance expend itures relative to the best es timate with waiver scenario. Note, while persons electing to not purchase QHP coverage witho ut the waiver will be eligible for both Medicaid and QHP coverage under the waiver, we have assumed these persons will e nroll in Medicaid (or remain uninsured) under the waiver. As out-of-pocket QHP premium co sts are not estimated to materia lly change as a result of the waiver for persons qualifying for premium assistance that have income between 100% and 138% F PL under the waiver, we have assumed the Choice Waiver will not change the likelihood of this population cohort purchasing QHP coverage through YHI.

The per capita APTC amount is estimated to decrease by ap proximately 2% in 2019. The per capita APTC savings, coupled with the decrease in APTC enrollees, results in APTC sa vings under the waiver ranging from $18 to $91 million. To the extent additiona l QHP enrollees op t to transition to Med icaid, APTC saving s would increase.

COMPREHENSIVEN ESS REQUIREMENTS As required under 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(3)(iv)(A), a state's propo sed 1332 waiver must provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the coverage defined in Section 1302(b) of the ACA. As described in CMS-9936-N, comprehensiveness refers to the scope of benefits pr ovided by the coverage as mea sured by the extent to which coverage meets the requirements for essential health benefits (EHBs). The Choice W aiver makes no changes to EHB requirements in the individual market. Persons transitioning from QHP to Medicaid c overage will receive additional transportation and behavioral health benefits. As the Choice W aiver makes no changes to indiv idual market coverage access or EHB requirements, the Choice Waiver fulfills the compre hensiveness requirements of 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(4)(iv)(A). State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 32 July 8, 2019 SECTION II. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 45 CFR 155.1308(f)(4)(ii) require s the Section 1332 Waiver appl ication to provide economic anal yses to support the State's estimates that the proposed waiver will comply with the compreh ensive coverage requirement, the affordability requirement, and the scope of coverage require ment and the f ederal deficit r equirement. Analyses related to the estimated impact of the 1332 waiver to health insurance coverage in Idaho has been prov ided within the actuarial ce rtification. This section addresses the deficit neutrality r equirements of the waiver app lication, providing a ten-year b udget plan that includes all costs under the waiver, including administrative and other cost s to the federal government. As shown in the actuarial analy sis, Figure 31, the Choice Waive r is estimated to have a signi ficant impact on the federal government APTC expenditures for Idahoans purchasing health ins urance coverage through YHI. Figure 32 provides a summary of estimated federal expenditure c hanges during the ten-y ear projection period.

Dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest million. 2. Total values separately rounded. 3. Analysis does not reflect the federal governm ent's costs rel ated to Medicaid expansion. Federal APTC Expenditures: As the Choice Waiver is estimat ed to reduce both the number of Idahoans receiving an APTC as well as the cost of the sec ond lowest cost Silver plan (subs idy benchmark plan) during the projection period, the federal government's APTC expenditures f or currently-eligible Idahoans is expected to be reduced. Fur ther detail on APTC savings is provided in Figure 31 of the actuarial certification. Aggregate Shared Responsibility Payments : Under 26 U.S. Code \u00a7 5000A, a taxpayer must maintain minimum essential coverage for his or herself, as well as dependents, or otherwis e be subject to a penalty for failure to maintain coverage.13 This provision is commonly referred to as the \"individual manda te penalty\". Under the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017, the individual mandate penalty was repealed beginning for the 2019 tax year.14 We have assumed the absence of an individual mandate penalty for the duration of the ten-year projection per iod. Therefore, we do not project any changes in federal revenue related to shared responsibility payments. Exchange User Fee : For states electing to use t he federally-facilitated marketpl ace (FFM), the federal government requires a 3.0% assessment on insurance ma rketplace premium to support t he operation of the FFM. We have assumed YHI, Idaho's state-based insurance marketplac e, will continue to operate dur ing the ten-year projection period. Therefore, we do not estimate any change in federal expenditures as it relates to th e Exchange User Fee. 13 See https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A for more information. 14 See https://www.congress.gov/bill/11 5th-congress/house-bill/1 for more information. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 33 July 8, 2019 Health Insurer Fee : Section 9010 of the ACA mandates a national assessment on hea lth insurers of $14.3 billion in 2018. The national assessment amount is indexed based on the \"premium growth rate\" as defined under the ACA. For 2019, a moratorium on the HIF was put in place by the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017. In 2020 and thereafter, the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) will target colle cting $14.3 bil lion (plus the i ndexing adjustment), regardles s of changes in premium volume. Beginning in 2020, the premium gr owth rate used in the indexing of the collected HIF amounts will be based on an index measure that includes projected individual and group market hea lth insurance premiums.15 As the Choice Waiver is estimated to reduce in dividual market premi um rates by (1%) to (4%) over the course of the t en-year project ion period, the waiver, in theory, would reduce the premium growth rate used to calculate the HIF, resulting in less federal revenue from the tax. However, CMS projects approximately 190 million person s will receive health insurance coverage through the employer-sponsored insurance and direct purchase markets during the projection period.16 Because Idaho's individual market represents less than 0.1% of this enrollment total and t he minimal magnitude to the premium rate change under the Choice Waiver, we do not estimate the Choice Waiver will have a material effect on the prem ium growth rate calculation and the corresponding indexing o f the HIF annual collection amo unt. and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 34 July 8, 2019 SECTION III. ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGY 1. MARKET CALIBRATION A key aspect of modeling healthcare reform proposals is establi shing a status quo set of assumptions for the population being modeled. For the State of I daho insurance markets, we dev eloped estimates for the number of Idahoans insured through each insurance market (or uninsured) in 2019 by age, ge nder, household income, health status, metallic level (if applicable for the market), premium rates, and other factors to establish baseline assumptions for Idaho's population with respect to health insurance coverage. We developed our starting census and premium rate assumptions for each insurance market from a number of publicly available data sources, as wel l as proprietary informa tion provided by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfar e (DHW), Idaho Department of Ins urance (IDOI), and YHI. The assumptions in the model related to insurance take-up rates and market migration have be en calibrated based on observed insurance market experience during calendar years 2015 through 2019. This calibr ation was based on publicly available data related to insurance marketplace enrollment, as well as proprietary data t hat we received from the IDOI and YHI, along with other sources we have gat hered and developed. Data from the IDOI included January and February 2019 enrollmen t and premium information for individual market coverage, member-level enrollment and claims information from 2 016 EDGE server data for participating insurers in the individual ACA-compliant market, and 2018 exchange enrollment b y rating area. Proprietary data received from DHW included Medicaid enrollment by household income, aid category, and age group, as well as August 2018 marketplace enrollment by income, metallic level, and associated federal pr emium assistance. Public data sources used in our census and assumption calibration process include: o Idaho Census Projections - To project statewide census changes by age and gender, we util ized population projections from 2016 through 2026 published by the Idaho Depar tment of Labor.17 For years after 2025, we assumed annual population grow th equal to estimated changes fro m 2024 to 2025. o American Community Survey (ACS) data - Due to the large sample size, ACS data were used to provide estimated enrollment distributi ons by insurance coverage, age, gender, FPL, and marital status. Adjustments were made to the ACS data to reflect an over-reporting of non-group coverage relative to act ual insurer data, and corresponding under-count of Medicaid enrollment. o Medical Loss Ratio Reporting Form data (MLR) data - MLR data is required to be submitted by carriers offering fully-insured commercial products for the purpose of complying with federal MLR reporting requirements. Publicly available MLR information from 2016 and 2017 was used to evalua te historical changes in the number of covered lives by insurance segment and market per capita premium. This source of information includes a more credible source of insured lives relative to population survey data for non-group and fully insured group markets. o Marketplace Enrollment Reports - We utilized publicly available data provided by the United S tates Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS) related to the 2019 open enr ollment period.18 o Statutory Financial Statement Data -For 2018 health insurance market enrollment and premium values , we reviewed 2018 statutory statem ent information for Idaho's healt h insurers. Based on actual insurance enrollment from insurer financial dat a and public programs, we es timated 2019 enrollment counts for each insurance market. The ACS demographic distributions we re used to allocate enrollment in each market by age, gender, and income level. For the individual market, August 201 8 APTC enrollment detail was also used to calibrate our model's baseline values. Updated individual market enrollment d etail for 2019 may impact our baseline and with waiver estimates contained in this report. 17 See http://lmi.idaho.gov/population-projections for more information. 18 See https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statis tics-Trends-and-Reports/Marketplace-Products/2019_Open_Enrollme nt.html for more information. Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 35 July 8, 2019 2. POPULATION MODELING Based on the Idaho census proje ctions, we estimated enrollment in each insurance market from 2020 through 2029 by assuming the distribution of ins urance market enrollment by age , gender, and income level would remain constant relative to 2019. Changes in insurance ma rket enrollment during the proj ection period are a result of changes in the estimated number of Idahoans by age and gender in the census projections. For example, the census pro jections estimate the number of Idahoans age 65 and over will increase from approximately 25 4,000 in 2016 to 374,000 by 2026. This results in a corresponding increase in the number of estimated Medicare enro llees during the same time period. We evaluated this methodology on a national basis and observed growth in the numb er of Medicaid, Medicare, and employer-sponsored insurance enrollees consist ent with CMS projections.19 We have assumed individual market enrollment and premium rates will be relatively stable during the projection period relative to the 2014 through 2018 coverage years, which experie nced significant enrollment swings and premium rate changes. Our modeling assumes the economic environment in the b aseline year continues during the projection period. An economic downturn during the projection period may materially a lter health insurance coverage sources and premiums. For example, if unemployment rates increased, we would estimate a s hift in health insurance coverage from employer- sponsored insurance to Medicaid, individual market coverage, or an increase in t he number of uninsur ed individuals. In our projections, we have estimated immaterial changes in non -group coverage for the population eligible for APTC (other than persons with household income between 100% and 138% FPL). As the structure of the APTC calculation caps a consumer's out-of-pocket premium, we have assumed immaterial en rollment changes (other than those driven by census projections), for the population e ligible for APTC that has inc ome above 138% FPL. This assumption is supported by the stability in APTC enrollment from 2016 through 2019, despite si gnificant premium rate increases occurring in the market. As discussed in this report, the Idaho's Choice Waiver is not e stimated to have a material impact on out-of-pocket premiums for the population currently eligible for APTCs. Therefore, und er both the without waiver and waiver scenarios, we assumed relatively similar APTC enrollm ent for income cohorts above 138 % FPL that have existing APTC eligibility. Morbidity Levels For the uninsured and non-group markets, we divided enrollment into five risk levels, and assigned a morbidity factor to each risk level based on allowed claim cost relativities. Claim cost relativities were established by summarizing 2016 EDGE server data collected by the IDOI. Note, 2017 and 2018 EDGE dat a was not available for our analysis. However, we do not believe the claim cost relativities would materially change wit h updated experience. Individual Mandate Repeal We have assumed individual mar ket enrollment and premium rate c hanges in 2019 are reflective of the individual mandate repeal20. It is possible that consumer awareness of the individual man date repeal will increase dur ing the projection period, resulting in enrollment decreas es in the individual market. Individual Market Enrollment Changes For the population not eligible for APTC (largely Idahoans with income above 400% FPL), we have assumed further attrition in market enrollment will occur after 2019, with or without the Choice Waiver. We estimate individual market enrollment for the population with income above 400% FPL will decrease from 37 ,000 in 2019 to 23,000 in 2029. The decrease in individual market enrollment in this cohort i s primarily attributable to t he assumed phase-out of non-ACA coverage in 2021. From 2021 through 2029, enrollment is esti mated to decrease by only 2,000 persons. For overall individual market enrollment, we project minimal ma rket enrollment declines fro m 2019 through the end of the ten-year projection peri od under both scenarios: 2019) (2029) With waiver: 112,000 (2 019) to 102,000 (2029) In our review of insurance market enrollment estimates, we exam ined market projections performed by third parties, including the federal government. In March 2019, the Congressio nal Budget Office (CBO) estimated non-group insurance market enrollment at 14 million in 2019 but decreasing to 11 mi llion by 2029.21 The CBO attributes this decline to the absence of the individual mandate penalty and additional states expanding Medicaid during the projection period. 19 See https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statis tics-Trends-and- Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/ Downloads/Proj2018Tables.zip , Table 17, for more information. 20 Technically, the Tax Cuts and J obs Act of 2017 set the individ ual mandate penalty to $0 fo r 2019 and future years. 21 See https://www.cbo.gov/system/file s/2019-05/55085-HealthCoverageSu bsidies_0.pdf , Table 1-1, for more information. State Relief and Empowerment Waiver: Actuarial Ana lyses and Certification and Economic Analyses 36 July 8, 2019 Accounting for additional state Medicaid expansion, we believe our enrollment projections for the individual market are generally consistent with the CBO's. 3. PREMIUM AND CLAIMS EXPENSE PROJECTIONS Premium and claims expenses est imated in the non-group market a re based on a combination of the following factors: Estimated healthcare inflation ( assuming no change in benefit levels or insured demographics); Changes in population morbidity (as measured by the assigned m orbidity factors to each risk quintile); Estimated changes in non-claims e xpenses (administrative costs , fees and taxes, and insurer margin); and, Changes in composite benefit lev el (the mix of coverage by met allic tier in the non-group market). Health care inflation assumptions were based on premium rate pr ojections published by the CMS Office of the Actuary.22 Population morbidity changes were developed based on the compos ite mix of morbidity scores for the population estimated to purchase non-group coverage in a given year. For individuals estimated to enroll or maintain non-group cover age, a metallic tier plan is ass igned based on the distribution of metallic plans selected fo r 2019 through YHI by income level . For example, based on YHI data, individuals qualifying for CSR payments between 100% and 250% FPL have a much greater like lihood of purchasing a Silver plan, relative to households at higher income levels. Federal premium assistance was estimated based on premium rate changes for the second-lowest cost Silver plan available through YHI, projected household income by FPL, and the indexin g of the premium tax credit expenditures.

CAMERON Director Equal Opportunity Employer May 31, 2019 Idaho Department of Insurance Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver Notice of Public Hearing and Public Comment Period The Idaho Department of Insurance gives notice of intent to apply to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and to the United States Department of the Treasury for a Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver on or about July 1 5, 201 9. The purpose of the waiver , the Coverage Choice Waiver , is to allow individuals with income s from 100% to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) the choice to receive help paying health insurance premiums while enrolled in private health insurance coverage, while also allowing the choice to be enrolled in Medicaid . The proposed effective date for the waiver is January 1, 20 20. In November 2018, voters passed a proposition to expand Medicaid eligibility t o individuals with incomes up to 138% FPL. The Idaho legislature then passed SB1204aa, instructing the Department of Health and Welfare and the Department of Insurance to seek a waiver from the federal government to give certain individuals eligible for Medicaid expansion the choice to continue to receive a tax credit to purchase a qualified health plan through the Idaho health insurance exchange instead of enrolling in Medicaid. Under current federal law, individuals who are eligible for Medicaid do not qualify for the tax credit. Under the waiver, expansion of coverage to Idahoans with incomes of 138% FPL or lower will be as follows: Income 100% - 138% FPL - enrollment in private coverage with tax credits can continue; if an individual decline s to take the tax credit, the individual may choose Medicaid if eligible . Income under 100% FPL - generally eligible for Medicaid and not eligible for tax credits. The Department's comprehensive public notice, tribal notice and the waiver application are available on our website at https://doi.idaho.gov/publicinformation/publiccomments .

These requests to waive provisions of federal laws for Idaho's Medicaid and insurance exchange programs are expected to be submitted as soon as July 26th, 2019. We are requesting these waivers as required by changes to Idaho code in Senate Bill 1204* recently passed by the legislature and signed into Idaho law by Governor Little. Many of the new provisions in Idaho code and the waivers we will be requesting revolve around Medicaid expansion coverage for adults established through ballot initiative last November. The initiative established coverage for Idahoans age 19 through 64 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty limit who do not otherwise qualify for Medicaid. Coverage for this adult expansion group will start on January 1, 2020.

PUBLIC COMMENTS ON DRAFT WAIVER Comments on Idaho's 1332 \"Coverage Choice\" Waiver Liz Woodruff, Assistant Director, Idaho Voices for Children Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Idaho's 133 2 \"Coverage Choice\" waiver application. My name is Liz Woodruff and I am the assistant director of Idaho Voices for Children. Voices champions policies that help Idaho's kids and families thrive. Because affordable health coverage makes such a huge impact on the well\u00ad being of Idaho families, we have been working on closing the health coverage gap in Idaho for the past several years. We are deeply invested in ensuring that Idaho's voter-approved Medicaid expansion is implemented in a way that supports low\u00ad income families in Idaho receiving comprehensive and affordable health coverage. We are concerned that the proposed \"coverage choice\" waiver could lead to losses in coverage and increased financial burdens for Idahoans newly eligible for Medicaid under expansion. While we understand the desire of some lawmakers in Idaho to provide a choice of coverage between Medicaid and exchange coverage, we are not confident that the proposed application does enough to clarify how this will be a true choice for Idahoans now eligible for Medicaid. For example, it appears as though an Idahoan between 100-138% FPL will first have to decline coverage on the state exchange before they are informed about their option to choose Medicaid. To be a true choice, these options must be shared in tandem and the full costs and benefits of each program should be provided side-by\u00ad side for the consumer. It is also unclear how a true choice can work seamlessly when eligibility for Medicaid and subsidized coverage through the exchange using advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) operate on different timelines. Medicaid expansion is intended to reduce the significant burden of health coverage costs for Idaho's low-income working families. Exchange plans require out-of\u00ad pocket costs while Medicaid does not. In most instances, Medicaid offers a better benefits package, especially for Idahoans with behavioral health conditions. Therefore, a process must be in place to ensure Idahoans are informed about the benefits package they will receive and the out-of-pocket costs, such as premiums and copays, they may incur depending on which plan they choose. If approved and implemented, this proposal must also include an approach to safeguard consumers from being steered into either Medicaid coverage or exchange coverage by providers, brokers, or insurance companies. Since the people who often help consumers choose their insurance plans have a vested financial interest in which insurance a given individual chooses, a process must be in place to ensure this choice is not unduly influenced by these vested interests. We are also struggling to understand some of the logistical aspects of administering the proposed program. For example, what if a family chooses private insurance and then fails to pay their premiums? How and when will they be made aware of the availability of Medicaid coverage? Or what if a family chooses to enroll in the exchange during open enrollment, and then has an unexpected medical event and determines they can't cover the deductible; would they be able to access retroactive Medicaid to help cover costs? And how would mid-year changes in coverage plans impact the deficit neutrality claims made in Idaho's application? It's also important to note that the baseline assumption regarding deficit neutrality in the application is flawed. Because these Idahoans will be eligible for Medicaid as of January 1, 2020 the baseline assumption (against which the 1332 waiver proposal is judged) must be that they will be covered through Medicaid rather than purchasing health insurance on the state exchange. Allowing this group of people to claim a monthly tax credit to cover their premium costs, as the waiver proposes, will actually increase federal spending relative to current law; costing the federal government $3,822 more per person than covering them through Medicaid. Idaho is poised to make historic strides toward ensuring all families have comprehensive and affordable health coverage. This comes on the heels of a new report showing Idaho had the largest decline in enrollment-11 percent- of children in CHIP /Medicaid than any other state in the country. We are very concerned that many of these children are becoming uninsured as there is no clear evidence that they are all moving to employer-sponsored insurance. We know that when parents are insured, children are more likely to be insured. Will the proposed waiver only serve to confuse families seeking health coverage, and therefore exacerbate this alarming trend in children's coverage in Idaho? While this waiver application is well intended, in its current form the proposal could create more confusion for families seeking affordable coverage options. This confusion could lead to lapses in coverage and increased financial burdens. Thank you for your consideration of our comments. Product Review Bureau Chief Department of Insurance P .o. flax 83720; Boise, Idaho 83720-0043 June 24, 2019 lJ f I d ;J h \u00b7G Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Idaho's 1332 waiver application. While American Association of University Women (AAUW) understands the desire to provide a choice of health coverage options for Idahoans below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL}, there are factors about this particular waiver request that raise concerns about how it would be implemented. AAUW advances equity for women and girls through advocacy, education and research. Idaho AAUW represents 400 members and is a part of a nationwide network of more than 170,000 members and supporters. AAUW supports increased access to quality, affordable health care. AAUW is concerned that under this waiver Idahoans may not have a fully informed choice or a true choice at all when it comes to their health insurance options. The application seems to indicate that Idahoans in the 1D0-138%FPL income range would be first screened for Medicaid, but then funneled towards private coverage on the exchange first rather than presented a choice between private insurance and Medicaid. If Idahoans have to decline private insurance before being able to enroll in Medicaid or even learn of the option for Medicaid coverage, then this isn't an honest choice. One aspect of this process is that Medicaid coverage is mare comprehensive than private insurance. Idahoans with mental illness will likely find Medicaid is better tailored to their needs as it pertains to case management, therapy and detoxification. On a personal level, my daughter at age 15 was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I was fortunate that the company I worked for provided mental health insurance. I cannot express how Important that safety net was for my family. Will Idahoans with behavioral health conditions be adequately counseled on options are available to them and what private insurance may not cover? In addition, insurance companies and health care providers have vested interests in which people enroll in Medicaid and which people stay on the exchange. Will protections be in place to ensure these interests do not bias consumer information? MUW supports providing choice for Idahoans. However, it is important, in fact critical, that Idahoans having to choose between private insurance and Medicaid have all the Information upfront and clearly presented In order to make an informed decision and truly have a choice. Thank you, Bonnie McKay Pfaff Co-President, AAUW Idaho According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness nearly a quarter of Idahoans are living with a mental illness. Nearly 6 percent of those people are living with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In addition, Idaho has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. On average, Idaho's suicide rate is 48 percent higher than the national rate. (https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/topic/crisis\u00ad understanding-idahos-fraqmented-mental-health-system#stream/O) The 1332 waiver tells an Idahoan who works but whose wages are at poverty level or just above that they can go on Medicaid ... or they can go on the Idaho exchange and pay a premium, maybe small, and have a deductible, maybe a small deductible, and then need to reapply next year without any assurances that their plan will still exist the next year. Will anyone from the Idaho Department of Insurance guide them through their choice? Will that person be educated to handle the needs of the diagnosed and undiagnosed mentally ill? We have a daughter with diagnosed mental illness. She's a wonderful, intelligent, sweet person, a single mom who works her day job plus at least one more and donates plasma to make ends meet. That is if she's not in illness crisis. Right now she has employer group insurance. Her goal is to not lose that, her illness makes that goal unpredictable, many days it seems unlikely. When she's in a panic attack, or dealing with self harm urges, she needs medical help, not to have to deal with the process of premiums and deductibles and uncertainty, all on her own. She doesn't need Idaho legislator's red tape. Statistically, we all have someone we love with mental illness. What do we want for them? We may be stuck with this waiver for now. Please make it doable for our Idahoans in crisis. Please, don't be part of the second gap our legislators gave Idahoans with mental illness. Give qualified guidance on this waiver. Additional information: Only 47.5% of adults with mental illness in Idaho receive any form of treatment from either the public system or private providers (according to SAMHSA). The remaining 52.1 % receive no mental health treatment. According to Mental Health America, Idaho is ranked 48 out of the 50 states and Washington D.C. for providing access to mental health services.

Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, the financial obligations associated with exchange plans can be higher and need to be clearly explained to all consumers - especially those who are eligible for Medicaid under expansion. In the case of someone like Sherry, who may need expensive medical care for herself or her son, a marketplace plan could severely set her back financially, compared to the care that would be covered under Medicaid. If Sherry mistakenly thought she had to purchase coverage through the marketplace, would she be able to switch to a Medicaid plan down the road? I also think of someone like Anita, a single mom of two, who just this month needed an emergency surgery to save her life. She is currently uninsured and doesn't know how she is going to pay her massive medical bills. To top it all off, she worries she might lose her job because of all the missed work. If she had been on private coverage and suddenly couldn't afford it because of this medical emergency, would she be automatically enrolled in Medicaid if she loses her coverage? Would retroactive Medicaid coverage apply to her? Additionally, how will the implementation of a tax credit work outside of open enrollment? If an individual applies for Medicaid in July, will they be given the option of an exchange plan with premium assistance? How will enrollees know the kinds of services and treatments that Medicaid would cover that private insurance might not? Will insurance representatives be trained to accurately counsel people on the differences between private insurance and Medicaid coverage? We insist that safeguards must be in place to ensure Idahoans are given all the information they need to compare the cost and benefits of exchange plans with health insurance through Medicaid. We must make sure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of insurance companies or health care providers. A true choice for consumers is one where they are completely informed of their options. Thank you. To: Product Review Bureau Chief Department of Insurance From: Hillarie Hagen -Close the Gap Idaho ID 83702 RE: 1332 \"Coverage Choice\" waiver public hearing testimony Hello. My name is Hillarie Hagen and I'm here representing Close the Gap Idaho. Thank you for having me today. For the past two years, I have been speaking with Idahoans in the health coverage Gap about their experiences going uninsured and how their lack of access to affordable health insurance has impacted their lives. Medicaid expansion, as passed by 61 percent of voters, provides a straightforward path to comprehensive health coverage for these Idahoans. As our state considers the 1332 \"Coverage Choice\" waiver, we have some serious concerns\u00ad and many questions-about how Idahoans would be impacted. In my work, I see how confusing health care can be for consumers and how the voter-passed Medicaid expansion was to be a clear way to connect Idahoans in the coverage gap with quality health insurance. If approved, this 1332 \"Coverage Choice\" waiver could make accessing affordable coverage more complicated and confusing for these consumers. I am here today to stand for the thousands of Idahoans who would need to be fully informed of this choice as well as the potential consequences of choosing private coverage on the exchange. For example, the application indicates consumers between 100 and 138 percent Federal Poverty Level would first be offered an Advance Premium Tax Credit to purchase a plan on Idaho's insurance exchange before they are ever informed of their Medicaid eligibility. If someone mistakenly thinks they have to purchase a marketplace plan, this could cost them [hundreds more a month] than if they elected to get their health insurance through Medicaid. Will consumers be informed that Medicaid is an option, and could cost them less than a marketplace plan, or will they have to first decline their tax credit before they get that information? What's more, will they have to go through a second application process to access Medicaid? Just last week I spoke with Sherry, a 50-year-old woman in the coverage gap who lives in Saint Anthony. She suffers from significant health conditions and also serves as caretaker to her adult son who has special needs. Sherry has a lot on her plate and was struggling to understand what was happening in general with Medicaid expansion -not to mention what she personally qualifies for under the new rules. Sherry, and countless others like her, needs to be informed, up front, that she can choose Medicaid OR private coverage with a tax credit. She needs to know the differences between Medicaid and exchange plans so she can make an informed decision based on the care her family needs. Thank you for allowing me to testify. I am here to state my concerns with the 1332 waiver application. I understand this policy was written with the intent to give people a choice, however I am concerned with how the implementation of the actual policy would unfold. I am concerned that people may be steered onto a more costly private plan as there is no mechanism to give individuals a clear understanding between the two options. I am concerned that the financial obligations for private plans would not be fully explained, up front, to enrollees and then compared to the cost of being enrolled in Medicaid. There needs to be a well thought out transparent system in place that fully informs enrollees about what choices they have and the costs related to each. This system should be unbiased and protect consumers. Administers of the program must be adequately trained and safeguards put in place to ensure that the interests of insurance companies or health care providers are not put before the needs of enrollees. As the policy is currently written, individuals would have to decline private health coverage before being offered information on Medicaid. This is not giving enrollees a true choice. Idahoans who need the dependability of affordable and inclusive coverage should not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid. I sincerely hope these concerns are taken under serious review when considering whether or not to approve this waiver. Respectfully, Tracy Olson Statement from Reclaim Idaho re: 1332 Waiver\u00b7 Boise Idaho Hearing June 24, 2019. My name Is Sam Sandmire and I represent Reclaim Idaho -the nonpartisan, volunteer organization responsible for putting Medicaid Expansion on the November 2018 ballot. Reclaim Idaho opposes this restriction to healthcare coverage for Idaho families. We believe it is a \"bait and switch\" scheme designed to steer Idahoans to more expensive and less reliable healthcare plans, An estimated 10,000 Idahoans may be affected by this restriction. The stated purpose of this restriction is to give Idahoans earning between 100-138% of the federal poverty level a quote-unquote \"choice\" to enroll in, or, maintain exchange-based coverage even though those same Idahoans qualify for Medicaid Expansion. Medicaid Expansion provides far more reliable and valuable healthcare coverage than exchange-based plans. The subsidized plans come with large co-pays and even larger deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. While this restriction is cloaked in the veil of \"choice,\" it Is nothing more than a mechanism to confuse thousands of working-class Idahoans who may be denied, even Inadvertently, information about the benefits of Medicaid Expansion. There is no indication from the language of the Jaw that thousands of working Idahoans will be given a real \"choice\" about whether to stay on subsidized plans or switch to Medicaid Expansion. Reclaim Idaho Is concerned about the transparency and availability of Information regarding this \"choice.\" If working Idahoans don't have access to the pros and cons of subsidized insurance versus Medicaid Expansion, then the \"choice\" is a false one. For instance, will Idahoans In this group be given a side-by-side comparison of the benefits of exchange\u00ad based coverage versus Medicaid Expansion? If someone decides to stay on exchange-based plans and misses a payment, will they lose healthcare coverage -even if they qualify for Medicaid Expansion? Are working Idahoans in this group expected to independently navigate the exchange-based healthcare program AND Medicaid Expansion? These are daunting and dangerous questions which have nothing to do with Medicaid Expansion's stated purpose, which is providing healthcare access to American familles and communities. Finally, there is the cost. It is unclear whether this restriction is \"deficit-neutral.\" By law, any restriction to healthcare coverage must be cheaper to taxpayers than denying the restriction. It's difficult to predict the reasons why Idahoans would choose to stay on expensive and unreliable exchange-based coverage as opposed to Medicaid Expansion. However, Idaho's 2018 application for a healthcare \"waiver\" indicates that subsidies for exchange-based insurance costs will run us twice as much as putting those same people on Medicaid Expansion benefits. All told, this restriction to coverage, or \"waiver,\" provides a false \"choice\" to an estimated 10,000 Idahoans who may get stuck with expensive and unreliable healthcare access. Approving this waiver will increase costs both for taxpayers and for working Idahoans who need healthcare. We thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to speak publicly on this issue.

Research indicates that 1 in 4 families in rural counties have a very difficult time managing healthcare costs, as opposed to 14% in urban areas. Additionally, this will have greater implications on Idaho's LatinX community, since the vast majority of these consumers live in rural areas and already lack healthcare coverage at more than twice the rate of white Idahoans. The state of Idaho needs to foster an environment where consumers are informed of their choices. This is a critical step toward ensuring better health outcomes. If this waiver is approved, Idaho must commit to educating and advising all Idaho consumers, so their decisions are made with adequate facts. Thank you. Ceci Thunes https://www.idahovoices.org/behavioralhealth/ https://www.facebook.com/ldahoBehavioralHealthAlliance/ June 24, 2019 1332 Waiver Comment Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Idaho's 1332 waiver application. My name is Ceci Thunes, and I represent the Idaho Behavioral Health Alliance, an advocacy network of consumers, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders dedicated to healthcare system transformation through payment reform and integration of behavioral health into Idaho's primary care system. While we appreciate the efforts to provide health coverage options for Idahoans below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, this particular waiver request raises concerns about implementation and impact on affordability and coverage for Idahoans, especially for those with mental illness or substance use disorders. The expansion of Medicaid in Idaho opens the door to accessible and affordable comprehensive behavioral health coverage and services to all Idahoans -ensuring a critical foundation to maintain self-sufficiency and the ability to take care of their families and serve their communities. Offering easy access should be simple and the primary objective. However, under this waiver Idahoans between 100-138% FPL may not be fully infoITTJed of their health insurance options. The application seems to indicate that, if approved, Idahoans in this income range would remain eligible for the Advanced Premium Tax Credit to purchase private health coverage on the state exchange and also be notified of their option to enroll in Medicaid. It is not clear what detailed information will be provided, such as comparisons in costs and benefits associated with private plans versus Medicaid. This is important because Medicaid coverage can be more comprehensive than private insurance, and Idahoans with mental illness or substance use disorders could expect to find Medicaid better-suited to their needs, as it is more likely to cover case management, individual and group therapy, detoxification, and various other critical services. Failing to present a clear choice between private insurance and Medicaid may lead to inadequate coverage or even loss of coverage, resulting in poorer health outcomes and other negative impacts for the individuals, their families, and their communities. Lack of access to consistent behavioral health services also puts increased pressure on crisis care centers, emergency rooms, and local law enforcement -especially in rural areas and on local budgets. This waiver could have further negative effects on families in Idaho's rural communities. People in rural areas already experience a higher rate of being uninsured due to lack of employment Lori Wright 3520 Meadow Dr. Boise, ID. 83706 6/24/2019 To the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Thank you for taking my comments. I volunteered with Reclaim Idaho through the Medicaid expansion initiative. I have been in business In Idaho for over 35 years. ft4;,.I \\__,-f (-lv'JiJ!\"'\"' L;1,/,;\u00b7 -\": My first concern ls about the process of enrolling on the state exchange with a private company vs being automatically enrolled with Medicald]'lt is my belief that private insurers should bear the burden of education, and marketing about their option to purchase insurance through the state exchange. Every business for profit Incurs cost and education/marketing should be built Into private insurers estimated costs vs putting this back on the people of Idaho and Health and Welfare. My seeernl concern is about mandating an \"opt out'' on the state exchange In order to be able to access Medicaid Expansion. I hope we can make this as easy as possible for that 100% to 138% and follow through with the will of the people to simply provide Medicaid Expansion to this population. I hope that the process is transparent with no more cost or additional work to the state of Idaho than would have been Incurred with clean expansion. Thank you, ~! 1_'1 L rl1 ~;1ght LX2 LLC. -Waiver Application: PUBLIC HEARING Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Idaho Department of Insurance ***Please Sign In*** Idaho Department of Insurance Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver DATE: Thursday, June 27, 2019 TIME: 10:00 AM -11:00 AM LOCATION: Health & WOMEN VOTERS\" I June 27, 2019 To: Dept of Insurance, Boise Idaho From: League of Women Voters of Idaho, Susan Ripley, president RE: 1332 Waiver Comment The League of Women Voters Idaho supports any and all efforts to implement the Medicaid expansion (Proposition 2) as passed by voters in November 2018. Expansion legislation during the 2019 session made several crucial changes to the original intent of the initiative including applying for federal waivers for the additions made by the Legislature. At the forefront of the changes is the so-called Opt-In 1332 Waiver that allows Idahoans within 100-138% of the federal poverty level to choose between enrolling in Medicaid or by using federal tax credits to enroll in Idaho marketplace insurance coverage. On the surface, the 1332 waivers look as if they offer alternatives with the same result. Further review of the two alternatives reveals differences that will be costly. An analysis by state officials in 2018 found the opt-in waivers would cost the federal government $7, 700 per eligible person per year for coverage using the exchange option. For the same group, coverage under Medicaid expansion option would cost the feds only $3,878 per person. That's a significant difference. In addition, Medicaid offers mental health services and benefits that might not be available through private insurance. Such services are essential in all communities throughout Idaho and the state would be remiss if anyone would be left without an option for that coverage. A mechanism also must be put in place to inform eligible Idahoans of the pros and cons of both options, including all benefits and costs, in understandable terms before they are required to choose. Estimates of Idahoans who are eligible under Medicaid expansion run around 62,000. The LWV Idaho believes those thousands would be best served under federal Medicaid coverage rather than insurance bought through the exchange. Proposition 2 was presented to the voters as an initiative to allow those \"in the gap\" (100-138% of the FPL) to be eligible for Medicaid coverage. Prop. 2 didn't include LWVID, PO Box 324, Boise ID 83701 lwvid.com https://www.facebook.com/lwvidaho any mention of possible recipients buying insurance in the private sector, or any of the other waiver subjects applied for. While it would be ideal if Medicaid expansion was implemented as passed without the addition and tweaks from the Legislature, we understand the political realities of the situation. We urge all caution be taken when considering the 1332 waivers to be submitted to the federal government to ensure those 62,000 Gem Staters are allowed to make informed health care decisions applicable to their options and needs. 2 LWVID Public Comment for 1332 Waiver application Good morning, My name is Laure' Larsen. 1 am a resident of Lewiston and have practiced as a registered nurse in the region since 1988. As a registered nurse I have seen first hand Idahoans who are suffering from diseases and mental health conditions that are managed poorly due to a lack of resources for medications and regular provider visits. I also know many Idahoans that do not have any health insurance due to the high cost of premiums. My specialty is critical care. When mental health, hypertension and diabetes are not well managed these people end up with emergency conditions that require expensive emergent care to treat depression, overdose , suicide, mental health conditions , stroke, heart attack, out of control blood sugars to name a few. Jdahoans deserve access to affordable health care that does not require them to pay high out of pocket costs and premiums or meet work reporting requirements . I support Medicaid e>epansion in the state of Idaho and waiver 1332 if it meets these requirement. It is very important that the plan is developed in a manner that makes it easy to access, affordable and effective. The system is complicated and many people are confused about what their options are. Information needs to be available that explains the enrollment process, costs and coverage available through Idaho Medicaid so informed decisions can be made. Research shows that providing preventative care results in improved heath and reduced costs. Idahoans in the 100-138% poverty level should be given a choice to enroll in Medicaid or to received federal tax credits if they enroll in marketplace insurance. Thank you I #~ \u00b7 Laure' Larsen 1632 Cedar Ave. Lewiston, ID 83501 \\)at< T ~J[A,0 :ct/y Dan J Schmidt Moscow ID June 27, 2019 Lewiston ID Testimony to Idaho Department of Insurance regarding 1332 Waiver application I applaud the Department of Insurance in your attempt to increase choice for Idaho Health Insurance subscribers. But your calculations have deeply flawed assumptions. First, with the passage of Prop. 2, and the failure of the legislature to repeal the law, this current status should be considered the baseline for comparison of any costs or \"savings\" when analyzing the requirement that a 1332 waiver be cost neutral. As far as I can tell, the Draft Coverage Choice Application May 2019 uses our current status, without Medicaid Expansion as a baseline, and thus every calculation is mistaken. For example, Table 2 \"Without Waiver Individual Market Enrollment\" line 3 \"100-138% FPL\" shows a slow increase from 18 thousand to 21 thousand members. In fact, this line should show zero in all the boxes, since these people are eligible for Medicaid enrollment, thus not eligible to participate in Your Health Idaho. With this reformatting of assumptions, all the subsequent calculations of savings fall apart. Second, the \"savings\" claimed by this application are only those of lost Advance Premium Tax Credits to the federal budget. By moving more people offYHI and onto Medicaid under the current law of full Medicaid Expansion, the \"savings\" to the federal budget of lost APTC costs would actually be much greater if all enrollees 0-138% FPL are enrolled in Medicaid. These were the findings of the initial Milliman report 2012, which I can no longer find online. This was part of the reasoning for the Governor's first work group to recommend full expansion. It saved both Idaho and the federal budget the most. The recommendation of the second workgroup (also text no longer available online that I could find) was to expand eligibility to 100% FPL and saved the state and the federal government less. Finally, the \"savings\" claimed by this application must be more inclusive, not just citing the decrease in APTC, but comparing the government costs of health insurance under both proposals. I tried to find a reference to this In Appendix \"A\" but the draft has no text in Appendix \"A\". I can appreciate that estimating what products will be chosen by enrollees between 100-138% FPL would be daunting, let alone their costs by different insurers. It is telling that Table 5 suggests an APTC cost with or without the waiver to the federal government ranges from $430-$802. At the same time Milliman in a report to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare July 2018 estimated a Medicaid PMPM cost of enrollment ranging from $212-$496 (Exhibit 2 page 16). With the 90% federal obligation of a net lower PMPM cost for Medicaid enrollment, rather than private coverage costing a higher APTC, the lowest cost choice is clearly full enrollment. Again, I thank the Department of Insurance the opportunity to comment on this proposaL I wish we could offer more choices to lower income folks. I just don't think we can afford it. June 27, 2019 Product Review Bureau Chief Department of Insurance P.O. Box 83720 Boise, Idaho 83720 My name is Gretchen Wissner. I am a resident of Moscow, Idaho. I thank you for the opportunity to comment in person on Idaho's 1332 waiver application. My primary concern with the choice waiver is related to the complexity involved in navigating our health care system. Will Idahoans eligible for Medicaid under the expanded coverage guidelines be provided with the information they need to knowledgeably compare the services Medicaid provides with the often confusing options available through the marketplace exchange? As a public school teacher in the Moscow School District for 36 years, I was very appreciative of those who served on the district's medical insurance committee. As the costs of health care increased dramatically, they were tasked with finding the best coverage possible for the dollars the district was willing and able to provide. At some point during that time, an insurance broker was hired to do the research for our committee members, who then narrowed the choices to a reasonable number for district employees to choose through a district-wide vote. The broker also assumed responsibility for making sure that we received the benefits which were part of our chosen plan. Too often the insurance company denied coverage for benefits which were clearly part of our plan or service providers requested co-pays that were not consistent with our plans. I use this as example of how difficult it is to navigate health care in this country, even for those of us with paid benefits, assistance In selecting plans appropriate for our needs, and money in reserve for unexpected, uncovered expenses. Idahoans qualify for Medicaid Expansion because they have limited financial resources. Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage than most private insurance plans. Health care providers are familiar with the services covered. Therefore, unexpected costs are unlikely to arise. If the choice waiver is granted, what agencies will be tasked with explaining to enrollees the coverage options, premiums and co-pays, the potential loss of coverage if premiums are not paid, etc.? This task cannot be delegated to private insurance providers with policies to sell. A true choice for consumers is one where they are completely Informed of their options and understand them. I am opposed to this waiver unless it is accompanied by a comprehensive information and selection assistance plan. Thank you. Gretchen Wissner Moscow, Idaho 83843 ' Statement from Reclaim Idaho in Opposition to \"1332\" Waiver (Submitted at Health and Welfare Public Hearing, June 27th, 2019) Reclaim Idaho is the nonpartisan, volunteer organization responsible for putting Medicaid Expansion on the November 2018 ballot. Reclaim Idaho opposes this restriction to healthcare coverag~ for Idaho families. We believe it is a \"bait and switch\" scheme designed to steer Idahoans to more expensive and less reliable healthcare plans. An estimated 10,000 Idahoans may be affected by this restriction. The stated purpose of this restriction is to give Idahoans earning between 100-138% of the federal poverty level a quote-unquote \"choice\" to enroll in, or, maintain exchange-based coverage even though those same Idahoans qualify for Medicaid Expansion. Medicaid Expansion provides far more reliable and valuable healthcare coverage than exchange-based plans. The subsidized plans come with large co-pays and even larger deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. While this restriction is cloaked in the veil of \"choice,\" it is nothing more than a mechanism to confuse thousands of working-class Idahoans who may be denied, even inadvertently, information about the benefits of Medicaid Expansion. There is no indication from the language of the law that thousands of working Idahoans will be given a real \"choice\" about whether to stay on subsidized plans or switch to Medicaid Expansion. Reclaim Idaho is concerned about the transparency and availability of information regarding this \"choice.\" If working Idahoans don't have access to the pros and cons of subsidized insurance versus Medicaid Expansion, then the \"choice\" is a false one. For instance, will Idahoans in this group be given a side-by-side comparison of the benefits of exchange-based coverage versus Medicaid Expansion? If someone decides to stay on exchange-based plans and misses a payment, will they lose healthcare coverage -even if they qualify for Medicaid Expansion? Are working Idahoans in this group expected to independently navigate the exchange-based healthcare program AND Medicaid Expansion? These are daunting and dangerous questions which have nothing to do with Medicaid Expansion's stated purpose, which is providing healthcare access to American families and communities. Finally, there is the cost. It is unclear whether this restriction is \"deficit-neutral.\" By law, any restriction to healthcare coverage must be cheaper to taxpayers than denying the restriction. It's difficult to predict the reasons why Idahoans would choose to stay on expensive and unreliable exchange-based coverage as opposed to Medicaid Expansion. However, Idaho's 2018 application for a healthcare \"waiver\" indicates that subsidies for exchange-based insurance costs will run us twice as much as putting those same people on Medicaid Expansion benefits. All told, this restriction to coverage, or \"waiver,\" provides a false \"choice\" to thousands of Idahoans who may get stuck with expensive and unreliable healthcare access. Approving this waiver will increase costs both for taxpayers and for working Idahoans who need healthcare. We thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to speak publicly on this issue.

Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0043 Dear Director Cameron: RECEIVED 0 DEPT OF INSURANCE JUL 0 1 201 The Idaho Olapter of the National Hemophilia FoWldation appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on Idaho's NCoverage O.Oice Waiver Application.\" The Idaho Chapter believes eveiyone should have access to quality and affordable health coverage. Unfortunately, this waiver will create additional confusion resulting in lower income individuals and families enrolling in more expensive and potentially Jess.comprehensive coverage. To ensure all low-income hanophilia patients have access to and enroll in quality and affordable beelthcare, Idaho should oppose the Coverage Cioice Waiver Application. Affordabiltty Most low-income Idahoans have lacked quality and affordable healthcare due to the late' s previous refusal to expand its Medicaid program to 138 percent of the federal poverty level or about $2.390 a month for a family of three. In November 2018, voters In Idaho approv~ full expansion of the Medicaid program. but the Idaho legislature defied this decision and approved additional restrictions on coverage indudJng a work reporting requirement The Coverage Choice Waiver, allO resulting from this legislation, will not .improve these lamilies' access to quality and affordable healthcare. The Coverage Cltoice Waiver would allow individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level to chooee to enrollee in either Medicaid or private insurance through the Idaho State Exchange. Private health insurance, even with Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APfCs) and oost-ehartng reductions (CSRs}, ls more experwive than Medicaid By Jaw, Medicaid COit~ cannot exceed more than five percent of an enrollee's income. Typkally, Medicaid enrollees don't pay premiums and have minimal cost-sharing. Those enrolled in private insurance are required to pay p:mniums o.nd are subject to additional cost-sl:\\armg in the forms of co-pays, co-iruuran~ and deductibles. Research shows that even limited cost-sharing ca.n deter low-income individuals from a<lCle98ing necessary healthcare services. Additionally, when Oregon implemented a premium in its Medicaid program, with a maximum premium of $20 per month. almost halt of enrollees lost coverage. The proposed waiver does not include the actuarial analysis to demonstrate coverage under this waiver would be as affordable as without tt Based on the information available and previous experiences with similar population, it appears the Coventge Choice Waiver does not meet the statuary requirement that coverage under a 1332 waiver be as affordable as it would be absent the waiv~. 'The Cover Otoice Waiver application does not provide specifi.c information on how individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level will be Wormed about their healthcare choia!S. Will these indmduals be piesented the option to enroll in Medicaid when they start the open etu<>llment process, or will that option only exist if they decline private coverage through the exchange? If it is the later, that is not a true choice. To further ensure enrollees would have a choice between exchange and Medicaid coverage, any enrollment 8S8istanc:e must be neutral and not biased towards one option or the other. Additionally, if a Medicaid-eligible individual enrolled in private inaurm:K2 wishes to enroll in Medicaid during the middle of a plan year, can they change their ooverage? For hemophilia patients, any gap In coverage can be detrimental to their prognaeis and health. It is lu111 C11t1U ffatllHlllllllNIUArlllNIAJlltl ~~ Jmperative that there is a dear and 11imple WlllY for individuals to enrollee in Medicaid if they become eligible during a time other than open enrollment. Ad~aci While both Medicaid expansion plans and private insurance sold in the exchange are required to cover the ten essential health benefits, there are some additional aervialS Medicaid is required to cover, but private inaurance ia not. Por example, Medicaid expansion plans provide non-emergency transportation services, a benefit private irlsu.rance does not provide. Additionally, Medicaid covers certain home health services and other 9efVices, including things like case management that private insW'8nce is not required to cover. Again, to ensure that enrollees fully understand the differences in their coverage options, robust and unbiased enrol.lrnent assistance would be audal. Bud,&\u00a2 Neutrality The propoaed Coverage Oto.ice Waiver claims to meet the budget neutrality guardrail for a 1332 waiver. Unfortunately, based on the information provided, this does not appear to be accurate. The waiver incorrectly calculates the budget neutrality assuming Medicaid expansion does not exist and the individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in exclumge coverage would otherwise be uninsured. This ls incorrect, as they would be otherwise enrolled in Medic;ai<l expansion. On top of that it is more expensive for the federal government for\u00b7individ'Uals between 100 and 138 percent FPL to enroll in exchange coverage than Medicaid expansion. A previous Idaho 1332 waiver analysis found that APTC and coat-sharing reductions for indMduals between 100 and 138 percent of FPL would cost the federal government $7,700 per person. The same analysis found Medicaid expamion would cost the federal government $3,878 per peraon.11 The proposed waiver application does not include the actuarial analysts needed to understand cost$ and coverage implications of this waiver. This information is needed as part of a compJete t1pplicatlon. Abeent the offidal actuarial analysis, previous estimates imply the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the budget neutrality guardrall The Idaho Chapter of the Hemophilia Foundation believes healthcare should be affordable, accessible, and adequate. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver compromises the affordability of healthcare coverage for some of Idaho's .most vulnerable residents. The Idaho O\\apter opposes this waiver.

All of the claims regarding the value of choice in private insurance on the exchange are a smokescreen. 'Choice' in this context usually means many conflicting options and many ways for the process to be confusing. This is counter to the whole point of expanded Medicaid. That goal is, as I see it, and as I voted for it, to make it easy for people to enroll and thereby reduce the number of uninsured citizens. So - keep it simple - no waivers.

Without the coverage provided by Medicaid, he would likely be homeless and unstable. A private plan would be impossible for him to navigate, even with family help, and givehim LESS coverage and options. My concern is for a transparent enrollment process that will allow Idahoans, likemy brother, to have a pathway to Medicaid coverage. How can he, and others like him, be informed if they fail topay their premiums and lose their coverage? How will he know the services and options that Medicaid would coverthat private insurers might not? He does not have the ability to navigate a market-based system that is profit-seeking.Americans with mental illnesses, like my brother, need a social safety net that ensures they get the coverage theyneed. Safeguards have to be in place to ensure insurance companies and health care providers cannot be biased intheir coverage. It is imperative consumers are informed of their options.

I resentedthat lawmakers thought that Idahoans did not know what they voted for. I think Medicaid coverage would benefitmany Idahoans, it will provide better health care than private insurance, and be more affordable. Sincerely,B A McClain PO Box 374Idaho City, ID 83631 From: Jacobsson To: Public Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 9:40:06 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am writing to express my objection to the 1332 \"waiver.\" I am a mental health counselor who has worked in both Washington, where Medicaid is expanded, and Idaho, where it is not (despite the vote of the people). Seeing thecontrast has been disheartening and at times, tragic. My colleagues and I frequently provide probono services tothose who would qualify for Medicaid under the expansion but cannot afford health insurance-- while we attempt tooffer this service, our availability barely even touches the surface of what is needed. These people cannot accesshealth services, including screenings, testing, medications and other treatments that are vital. My concerns with the 1332 \"waiver\" include the confusion and lack of clarity on what choice is actually available, the way that this \"waiver\" actually ends up costing more government funds, and the confusion that this so called\"waiver\" serves for regular Idahoans. The propaganda against Medicaid Expansion is ridiculous and needs to stop--in my opinion, healthcare is a right, and more and more Idahoans and other Americans are recognizing this too. Ihave met people who have become bankrupt and have lost homes because of medical bills. I myself, as a youngcollege student, had a seizure disorder and ended up with far more student debt because of attempting to paymedical bills. My parents helped as they could as missionaries overseas with limited income themselves. We by nomeans are struggling regularly, but the thousands of dollars on ambulance rides, ER visits, medical testing,medications and specialist visits were extremely disturbing to our family's financial well-being and causedtremendous stress. I was lucky enough to be a student where I had access to funds to borrow to pay those bills. IWOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR MEDICAID. A WAIVER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. IT ISNOT TRUE CHOICE.

I am concerned that people who are eligible for Medicaid Expansion will not get enough information to make an informed choice. Will they be clearly told that Medicaid offers more comprehensive coverage than private insurance and without premiums, co-pays, and deductibles ? It seems to me that this waiver could do more harm than good by creating a confusing situation. People receive information in different ways and I do not see how it canbe guaranteed that everyone gets full, understandable information with which to make their choice.

But inreality, it effectively discourages poor Idahoans from signing on to Medicaid even though their marketplaceinsurance plans are more expensive and less comprehensive than Medicaid. My reasoning is based on the followingconcerns: As I learned when faced with making Medicare decisions, marketplace insurance is cumbersome and difficult to navigate. I'm an educated retiree with time and some ability to do research, yet I needed the help of an insurance broker to understand my insurance needs and select the appropriate provider. The population most in need ofMedicaid Expansion does not have the time, the energy, and in many cases, the education to be able to navigate theconfusing private insurance quagmire. Subsidized plans carry large co-pays and even larger deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. What will happen to individuals who stay on an exchange-based plan but fall behind in paying those huge premiums? Willthey then be denied Medicaid coverage because they came too late to the party? Will working Idahoans be given a real \"choice\" about whether to stay on subsidized plans or switch to Medicaid Expansion? I am concerned about the transparency and availability of information regarding this \"choice.\"If working Idahoans don't have access to the pros and cons of subsidized insurance versus Medicaid Expansion, thenthe \"choice\" is a false one. As such, I would encourage you to deny this waiver as requested. All savings and economic stimulus rely on full, unmodified Medicaid Expansion, as passed by Idaho voters. Additional requirements or restrictions to Medicaid, will result in the state spending more in administrative, legaland oversight costs to develop the bureaucracy needed to enforce new requirements. In Kentucky alone, programs torestrict eligibility are estimated to cost $374 million to administer over two years and the state has been mired inlawsuits. Reducing the number of people covered from Medicaid Expansion would reduce estimated state savingsand diminish the forecasted positive economic impact of the new law. I'm tired of seeing the state of Idaho through money down the drain fighting senseless court battles over poorly written and thought out legislation. Please protect Medicaid Expansion in Idaho as the voters of this great state voted for it in 2018.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,Linda Paul 1715 S Grant 83706 From: To: Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 5:20:11 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Please- the voters in Idaho voted overwhelmingly to expand Medicaid after years of inaction by our legislators who are against the ACA and Medicaid. Please do not allow these sidebars like work requirements to be added. It will becostly and ineffective. Listen to the people. Our legislators are doing everything to shut up and weaken the voters.They even passed a bill that would have effectively banned voter initiatives. Luckily the governor vetoed it.Do not allow the restrictions on Medicaid expansion in Idaho.

I DO NOT SUPPORT our legislators' attempts to circumvent the vote of the people. The intent was to provide expanded medicaid to all qualified citizens, including those in the 100-138% of poverty level income. If approved the 1332 waiver being requested by the legislature will adversely affect the health of many Idaho citizens. Our citizens deserve stable affordable health insurance. Research shows that is the best way to take care of health and reduce healthcare costs over time. Please do not approve thiswaiver.

Medicaid Covers medical non emergent transportation to outpatient care which is especially needed in rural areas where providers are often adistance away from home. It will be very difficult to inform enrollees of they benefits and negatives of either privateplans or Medicaid. I am afraid that the state will make it difficult for people to understand the difference and in factpush people off Medicaid option to private ACA based care. Also what about people signing up for the ACA planand then finding out they can not afford the co pays or monthly premiums will they fall through the cracks and findthemselves without coverage. I oppose this waiver because it moves away from the intent to meet the medical needs of low income citizens and this waiver does not serve that mission. Sincerely,William Thomas PO BOX 1274MCCALL, ID 83638 From: Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 4:40:09 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am against the 1332 Waiver Application. Idahoan's in the 100- 134% of the poverty level need to have a clear pathway to medicaid. Medicaid covers MORE that most private health insurance plans. To be honest I wish I could BUY medicaid. It would be better coverage than our families pays thousands of dollars a year for. Idahoans should not have to choose to decline exchange coverage in order to learn more about Medicaid eligibility.

Why should the waiver be granted when Medicare provides better coverage at lower cost? (If this is not the case, if private insurance covers medical expenses at lower cost, why don't more Idahoans buy such health insurance?) Also, there is great danger in putting the power of information in the hands of insurance representatives. What incentive do they have to give accurate information to consumers? The federal government should deny this waiver request. Sincerely, Robert Goetsch 1230 S Higbee AveIdaho Falls, ID 83404 From: To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 3:50:09 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I oppose Idaho's request for a section 1332 waiver. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to imagine a situation where a Medicaid-eligible individual would be better off choosing coverage under Idaho's \"Your Health Idaho\" insurance exchange in lieu of Medicaid coverage for various reasons, including the following: - Unlike Medicaid, coverage under the Idaho exchange requires monthly premiums and is subject to deductibles. - Failure to pay a premium timely can result in loss of coverage which, even if subsequently corrected, creates a coverage gap; this risk does not arise under Medicaid coverage. - Medicaid covers more comprehensive mental health services. I understand that proponents of the 1332 waiver argue that citizens should be given choices, and that a program that requires them to accept Medicaid is paternalistic. In fact, free choice is meaningful only if all of the pros and cons are disclosed, and any comprehensive explanation would be so complicated and lengthy that I fear the vast majority of affected citizens would not read or understand the explanation. I urge you not to grant this waiver request.Sincerely,Charles Cole 1519 E Holly StBoise, ID 83712 From: Cliff Elliott, B.

I am against this time-wasting, money-wasting bureaucratic bamboozle called the 1332 Waiver. Especially if this is used by said bureaucrats to discourage hard-working wage earners fromgetting adequate healthcare. If this proposal is made law anyway, these people should be advised fully of bothchoices they would have, and they should know that they would get more comprehensive health care with theMedicaid coverage. They should be informed that should they choose a private plan, they will have to pay out-of-pocket premiums, and would lose coverage if they can't pay. A full explanation of both types of coverage is the onlyfair and just way to apply this waiver.I urge you to not adopt this pointless, needless, expensive waiver.

Any waiver flies in the face of the will of the people! The 1332 Waiver Application must not go Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 3:10:09 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, TO: DOI Product Review Bureau Chief The citizens of the state of Idaho voted for medicaid coverage for low income individuals and families by a large majority. Attempting to limit medicaid for these individuals, as evidenced by the above mentioned waiver application, is an attempt by the legislature to by pass the obviously demonstrated wishes of the citizens of this state. They are using politics to impact and regulate health care decisions for the people who need the most help. Making and keeping medicaid available, as approved by the voters, is more important than politics. We're talking about people health and lives, and medicaid is the best option available for the less fortunate, hard working citizens of this state. Purchasing insurance on the open market is not a good option and I ask you to reject this waiver application. Sincerely,Kam Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 3:00:12 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Co-pays and out of pocket costs for private insurance are confusing for many consumers. Helping people know their options and the costs involved is complicated. As a voter in Idaho, I support Medicaid coverage with no strings attached and no more hoops to jump through. Sincerely,Janis Perry PO Box 1870Boise, Wednesday, June 19, 2019 2:25:20 PM To Idaho Department of Insurance, I write to share my thoughts on the proposed Waiver #1332.I can't understand why any Idahoan who is eligible for Medicaid would choose private insurance instead. Private insurance will cost more for coverage that is not as good. No one inhis or her right mind would choose that. Unless, of course, they were not aware of the facts. This waiver appears to be an ideological effort to promote financial advantage for insurance companies. I would expect heavy advertising from the insurance industry to promote theirpolicies to people who are eligible for Medicaid. The advertising, of course, is unlikely to befully transparent about the facts because transparency would cut into profits. How will Idahoans know what insurance will best meet their without a sustained public relations campaign to counter the insurance companies' advertising? Who is going to provideand pay for this? I urge you to deny the application for Waiver #1332. It is not in the interest of Idaho's people.Thank you for your Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 12:30:09 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage than private insurance Medicaid offers better services and benefits to Idahoans with mental illness than private insurance; many people could risk losing out on more comprehensive coverage that they are eligible for because they were steered into a private plan instead. If this waiver is approved, a process must be in place to ensure Idahoans are informed about the benefits they will receive and the out of pocket costs, such as premiums and copays, they may incur depending on what choice they make. Idahoans up to 138% FPL will be eligible for Medicaid and this should be made clear to enrollees up front. They should not have to choose to decline exchange coverage in order to learn more about Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid offers more affordability and stability than plans on the exchange Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium and deductibles. These financial obligations must be clearly explained to this portion of the Medicaid eligible population in Idaho. Idahoans who need the dependability of affordable and inclusive coverage should not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid. While marketplace plans offer cost-sharing assistance to low-income individuals, these individuals would still face significantly higher out-of-pocket costs than in Medicaid, making it more difficult to afford going to the doctor or filling a prescription. Research shows that even relatively small levels of cost-sharing on Medicaid beneficiaries, ranging from $1 to $5, are associated with reduced use of care, including necessary services. Nearly 10,000 Idahoans today are eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange but don't, most likely due to the cost of health insurance. All eligible Idahoans should be shown a clear choice and pathway towards Medicaid coverage at the time of enrollment. Idahoans need a transparent and unbiased enrollment process and a clear pathway to Medicaid coverage Will Idahoans be informed that if they fail to pay their premiums they could lose their coverage? How will enrollees know the kinds of services and treatments that Medicaid would cover that private insurance might not? Will insurance representatives be trained to accurately counsel people on the differences between privateinsurance and Medicaid coverage? Safeguards must be in place to ensure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of insurance companies or health care providers. A true choice for consumers is one where they are completely informed of their options.

Understanding and making a wise decision is difficult for him. I have these questions: How will those on low incomes, health or cognitive impairment access or understand the information needed to make a decision? Computer accessibility, computer skills, telephone accessibility, office visits requiring time off work and transportation are all issues for individuals with low income, health or cognitive impairment. Will taxpayers be expected to pay for additional staff to help these people through the process? Or will the current help staff just bare a greater burden?

Sincerely,Pat Huffaker To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 10:10:23 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am extremely disappointed in the Idaho legislature's attempt to alter the Medicaid Expansion initiative passed by the folks of Idaho this past year. One of my concerns is the 1332 Waiver. Those people needing information about their health care choices should be well informed. How will this information be decimated to the population that needs it most? Though my knowledge is limited, it appears that Medicaid would be a more dependable and affordable option for many Idahoans than plans from private companies.

This small community consists of many citizens with low income, since many are part-time farm workers. Over the years, I saw many avoid medical attention because they could not even afford the huge co-pays and deductibles of their private \"health insurance\". I recall Nez Perce's newly-elected Sheriff Joe Rodriguez at one of our council meetings, where he told us that the biggest expense for the new county jail was \"health insurance\" for the inmates--since many were in very bad health, when they were brought to jail. Does this not show us how expensive it is, when a person's health goes beyond\"fixable\"? With many of our local citizens avoiding \"primary health examinations\", many of the small medical facilities in our area's communities are facing closure. That is why I supported the Medicaid Expansion initiative that was passed last fall. It is also why I am writing to express my objection to the 1332 \"waiver\", being sought by the State of Idaho, which would keep many of these citizens on exchange-based health plans, even though they qualify forMedicaid Expansion. With this confusion on the choice (and cost) of service, many are still reluctant to seek early medical help. One exchange makes its easier for people to take action on their health issues. These healthy citizens contribute to their communities and/or become tax paying citizens. thank you.

Many people who require mental health benefits have difficulties making choices and understanding complex information. It would be extremely unfair to them to expect them to wade through all of detailed information involved in choosing private health insurance. I fear that many of these low functioning patients will just go without health insurance and increase the burden on our hospitals and non-profit services. The majority of people who are mentally ill are not only low income, but are uneducated and have a host of other medical problems that would be better served by Medicaid expansion. The process of requiring them to wade through the various plans, keep track of deductibles and all the other \"business\" aspects of private insurance is not something that most of these people who are most in need are capable of doing. The hospitals and physicians will have to bear the costs of their care which will make everybody cost increase. thank you,Dr. Sharon B. Katz, Licensed Psychologist Sincerely,Sharon Katz Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 5:48:59 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am opposed to this waiver and any other waivers that come along. As one of the 60% of Idahoans who passed Medicaid Expansion, my intent in voting for this was that Idahoans up to 138% of the federal poverty level would be fully eligible for Medicaid, with no restrictions, because it provides comprehensive health care coverage for those who need it. In fact, it provides more comprehensive coverage than private plans do. All Idahoans deserveaffordable healthcare. There are thousands of Idahoans currently who are eligible to purchase a plan on the exchangebut don't, so there is no reason to offer that option to them when Medicaid is now available to them. They need to befully informed about the advantages of signing up for Medicaid and urged to do so as soon as possible.

This waiver would allow Idahoans at 100-138% of poverty level remain on state-run insurance exchanges. My concerns regarding this, should the waiver be granted, are as follow: Medicaid offers more stable, simpler health coverage than most insurance options offered on the state exchange. By encouraging Medicaid-eligible citizens to remain on the exchange, the state would be, in effect, encouraging worse,more expensive insurance. This is bad for individuals, and for medical establishments and providers in the state. Additionally, I am concerned about the cost of administering this waiver, and do not feel that there has been adequate analysis and transparency around this issue. My sense is that no one actually knows. The decision topursue this waiver has been based on a political belief that federal money is bad money and therefore be resisted,rather than careful analysis of the best way to insure lower income Idahoans. Lastly, I'm concerned about transparency regarding the costs, risks and benefits being explained to those eligible. Health insurance is maddeningly complex, even for those with expertise to figure it out. I'm doubtful that should thiswaiver be granted, that eligible citizens will have access to culturally and educationally appropraite resources todetermine what is best for them, and thus will not fully realize the benefit of Medicaid eligibility.

Sincerely,Amy Granger PO Box 1295Donnelly, ID 83615 From: Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 2:25:48 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, This letter is created to convey my objection to the 1332 \"waiver\" that is requested by the State of Idaho. The concern is that it will keep thousands of Idahoans from much needed affordable health care which they qualify for Medicaid expansion by keeping them on expensive exchange based health plans. Here are the specific reasons for my concerns: 1) The reason we need Medicaid expansion is due to it being more reliable and affordable then exchange plans. If people's only true choice is a plan with a high deductible, co-pay or out of pocket expense the reality is the person will choose not to seek medical help. The result is without regular check-ups and access to care, medical issues go undiagnosed until the person is so ill they go through the emergency room which results in a much higher cost and usually the medical problem is more expensive to remedy if it can be remedied. 2) My mother could not afford the expensive cost of insurance. When she raised me and my three sisters, it was rare we could afford medical visits or dental care and often waited until it was unavoidable and we'd be taken to the emergency room. In one situation, my sister contracted encephalitis. She remained in the hospital for several days, my mother was guilt ridden and my sister was forced to be held back a year in school from her twin which was mentally a challenge for her. Then my mother held back from going to the doctors on her fixed income which she could barely afford rent and food, and found out too late her Cancer she was diagnosed with was inoperable. Sadly, had she come in months prior it would have been a surgical fix and she could have lived to see the two kids I have today. But sadly, that did not happen, she passed away and could have lived many more years had she had access to affordable care. Please understand, while there is a cost, we are talking about real human lives. We should all want every single person in this great State of Idaho to live the healthiest live they can possibly live. All of us should want and expect basic access to preventative care and medicine that will prevent diseases from occurring and pre-mature death. I ask you to please consider objection to 1332 \"waiver\" so that health care access is affordable. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely,Kathy Corless Sincerely,Kathy Corless 2015 S From: Nancy Chaney To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 2:02:21 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Department of Insurance and Product Review Bureau Chief:Last November, Idaho voters spoke decisively by approving a grassroots initiative to expand Medicaid, no strings attached. (That, in spite of the stumbling blocks the Legislature has placed to make Idaho's initiative process almostinsurmountable.) Still, the Legislature couldn't resist another big switch-a-roo. In an affront to voters and the poor,they added so-called sideboards: waivers that are apparently intended to limit participation. The first of thosewaivers is before you now. That 1332 waiver would allow low-income residents who earn 100-138% of the poverty level (practically speaking, not a livable income) to keep private health insurance plans, even when those plans have high co-pays and jaw-dropping deductibles. On its face, having an option sounds good, but in this case, without consumer protectionsbuilt-in, this sideboard needs sideboards. The fallout would wreck individual health and households, and perpetuatereliance on county indigent funds (which, by the way, the Legislature is reportedly eyeballing as a way to pay forMedicaid Expansion), in addition to provider write-offs and the State catastrophic fund.I encourage you to deny that waiver, but if it is approved, transparency and hands-on guidance for consumers areimperative. People need to know up front that they have a choice. They shouldn't need to decline coverage throughthe State's insurance exchange before being told that they are eligible for Medicaid. They should know the pros andcons of what will and won't be covered in each scenario, particularly concerning comprehensive coverage withbehavioral health services, prescription drug coverage, and limits on treatment of chronic diseases, what theirmonthly premiums and co-pays will be, and what happens if they can't pay. Legal and procedural safeguards arevital to protecting consumer interests, so their options are not biased in favor of insurers or healthcare providers, andagainst some of the most vulnerable working poor.Medicaid is an affordable, comprehensive, relatively stable and reliable system. It exists to serve the low-incomepopulation who need it, just as the voters said last November. Please deny the 1332 waiver request from the Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 1:56:08 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am writing to register my opposition to the 1332 Waiver Application. This waiver would keep thousands of Idahoans on exchange-based health plans instead of Medicaid through the expansion of the Medicaid program. Evenwith cost-sharing assistance, these citizens would end up paying large co-pays and deductibles for market-basedprivate insurance, when they could receive more reliable and usable coverage under Medicaid. A big concern is whether information about the pros and cons of staying on the subsidized plans vs choosing Medicaid Expansion will be made fully available to the Idahoans who will be eligible for the Expansion. Experiencein other states that have received similar waivers to Medicaid Expansion suggests that many citizens have notunderstood that, for example, they will be denied healthcare coverage if they remain on private plans but fail tomake a payment. For these reasons, I urge you to deny the requested Waiver.Sincerely,Susan Kirkpatrick 231 Berg RdSagle, ID 83860 From: Terri Cowgill To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 1:20:09 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, To Whom it May Concern:I am writing to express my objection to the 1332 \"waiver\" being sought by the State of Idaho which would keep thousands of Idahoans on exchange-based health plans even though they qualify for Medicaid Expansion. It wasasked to not cut and paste the objection example, but the example is so succinct that I'm not sure I could add to thefollowing reasons: 1. Medicaid Expansion provides far more reliable and valuable healthcare coverage than exchange-based plans. That's the whole point of Medicaid Expansion. The subsidized plans come with large co-pays and even largerdeductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. While this restriction is cloaked in the veil of \"choice,\" it is nothing morethan a mechanism to confuse thousands of working-class citizens who may be denied, even inadvertently,information about the benefits of Medicaid Expansion. Also, will people be denied healthcare coverage if they stayon exchange-based plans and fail to pay for premiums? 2. It is unclear whether thousands of working Idahoans will be given a real \"choice\" about whether to stay on subsidized plans or switch to Medicaid Expansion. I am concerned about the transparency and availability ofinformation regarding this \"choice.\" If working Idahoans don't have access to the pros and cons of subsidizedinsurance versus Medicaid Expansion, then the \"choice\" is a false one. As such, I would encourage you to deny thiswaiver as requested. 3. Finally, there is the cost. While it is difficult to predict the factors that will contribute to a decision to stay on the exchange, it is almost certain that maintaining access to a federal tax credit, rather than moving this population toMedicaid will result in a higher cost to the federal government than straight Medicaid expansion.

We voted to expand Medicaid to remove many of the barriers that this causes and the Idaho legislature should have voted ensure that our wishes are instituted.

Sincerely,Margo Thompson 330 E 1st NSaint Anthony, ID 83445 From: Joseph Schueler To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 12:50:10 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am an Idaho nonprofit administrator who works regularly with low income families with children and those commonly referred to as the working poor. I find the sidebars and other attempts to restrict access to medicaid from this targeted group who is often un-insured or under-insured and I see firsthand the impact it has on families, their finances, and the risky behaviors that can result in youth, particularly when parents cannot get access to mentalhealth treatment and/or medications to ensure they can lead productive lives. I would like to see a study of how many medicaid gap qualified applicants possess private health insurance that is equal to or better than Medicaid and what the premiums are for those policies. As an employer, I see the premiums we must pay for our employees and even at the lowest cost option, the premiums are very expensive even for low quality, high deductible \"catastrophic coverage only\" plans. Even if a household qualified for Medicaid from this gap of incomes, I can think of no household who knows finance that would choose to pay for a plan when they are qualified for a free one in today's market. Those who would are simply making poor financial decisions and will stiff people like me as a landlord in other areas or bills. For this demographic, most are much to busy managing daily issues and near crisis level budget decisions to take the time to continue jumping through the sidebar hoops the Idaho legislature seems intent on creating for budget reasons. However, the Idaho legislature seems to be poor managers in finance, because to deny, delay, or treat differently these folks in regards to enrolling in Medicaid and/or in any way limiting their access to a coverage they qualify for only means larger costs in indigent care funds,lost work time, loss of employment, childcare problems, and ultimately for me, children not receiving the care and attention they need to grow into successful, productive citizens. Legislative tropes like these are what create systemic poverty, as opposed to a pathway to independence. Please, see the importance of expanded health care coverage for qualifying, low income households. The whole work requirement was enough of a charade, as non-working households would already qualify for medicaid if they were not employed. This all should be a non-issue, all they want to do is create hurdles to access so they can offset the cost of care from government subsidized health insurance, a right U.S. citizens deserve if they, for whateverreason (and I already know the reasons based upon how this state funds education and other prevention basedmethods of improving quality of life in a low wage state), do not earn enough to cover their bills and have enoughleft over to afford private health insurance. Give these families a chance to get out of their situation. Primarily, they need coverage to go to night school, to get their child up to school aged so they can take on a second job, cover their medications or other health costs so theycan continue to work and lead independent, productive lives and grow in their companies and accept promotions that enable them to rise out of Medicaid and back into the private market. Without a safety net, their alternatives are bleak at best and typically result in lost employment, homelessness, substance abuse, and even entrance into thesystem in far worse channels like Health & Welfare and indigent care, which cost us far more in lost taxes andincreased costs. Sincerely,Joseph Schueler 1002 To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 12:40:12 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am writing to express my OBJECTION to the 1332 \"waiver\" being sought by the State of Idaho which would keep thousands of Idahoans on exchange-based health plans even though they qualify for Medicaid Expansion. Myobjections are as follows: -Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage than private insurance: Medicaid offers better services and benefits to Idahoans with mental illness than private insurance; many peoplecould risk losing out on more comprehensive coverage that they are eligible for because they were steered into aprivate plan instead. If this waiver is approved, a process must be in place to ensure Idahoans are INFORMED aboutthe benefits package they will receive and the out of pocket costs, such as premiums and copays, that they may incurdepending on what choice they make. Idahoans should NOT have to choose to decline exchange coverage in orderto learn more about Medicaid eligibility. -Medicaid offers more affordability and stability than plans on the exchange: Exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium and deductibles. These must be clearly explained tothis portion of the Medicaid eligible population in Idaho. Idahoans who need the dependable and inclusive coverageshould not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid. While marketplace plans offer cost-sharingassistance to low-income individuals, these individuals would still face significantly HIGHER out-of-pocket coststhan in Medicaid, making it more difficult to afford going to the doctor or filling a prescription. Nearly 10,000Idahoans today are eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange but don't, most likely due to the COST of healthinsurance. Idahoans need a transparent and unbiased enrollment process and have a clear pathway to Medicaid coverage: Safeguards must be in place to ensure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of insurance companies orhealth care providers. A true choice for consumers is one where they are completely INFORMED of their options. These waivers were NOT voted on per the citizens of Idaho. The will of the people is being ignored with these waivers. Sincerely,Robert Ancker 2290 Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 12:40:11 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, The people of Idaho have spoken. We have shouted in fact. We want Medicaid Expansion, and we want it available to every person eligible. We did not vote to restrict it. We did not vote for guardrails. We voted for the state to provide Medicaid coverage to each and every person eligible. Why do we want Medicaid? Because it's better than the private options - plain and simple. Medicaid offers excellent care that is easy to use. We don't want to be forced into private plans - and our employers should have ZERO say inwhat kinds of health care we can access. We expect a transparent and unbiased enrollment process. We should not have to jump through hoops. We should not have to beg and plead for coverage. In short, the state of Idaho should provide exactly what we voted for - and should not twist and mangle it beyond recognition.

Sincerely,Charles Cavanaugh 2880 To: Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 12:30:13 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am opposed to this waiver, mainly because a very significant majority (60%) of Idahoans passed Medicaid Expansion (Proposition 2) with the intention of having no restrictions at all for those who qualify. Restrictions likethis waiver confuse enrollees and therefore will provide a barrier for people who need health care. AlthoughIdahoans up to 138% of the federal poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid, they need to be fully informed aboutthe benefits and costs of Medicaid compared to private health care plans. Medicaid provides much morecomprehensive health care coverage, including services and benefits for mental illness, than any private insurance,and this should be made perfectly clear to them. Whatever happens, they should not have to choose to decline exchange coverage in order to learn more about Medicaid eligibility. All choices must be completely transparent and fully explained. Any possible barriers tosigning up for Medicaid will cause them to avoid making a decision, and when they don't seek the care they need,they end up with even more serious health problems and have to go to an emergency room, which costs all of usmore through catastrophic funds from our property taxes. Idahoans deserve healthcare they can afford. Since there are nearly 10,000 Idahoans today who are eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange but don't, it is obvious that Medicaid is an obvious solution.

Exchange-based plans have large copays, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses,which many can't afford.

Sincerely,Michael Larkin 7505 W Portneuf RdPocatello, wavier Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 12:00:43 AM Department of Insurance, The proposed waiver to allow citizens to receive the advance premium tax credit and purchase a qualified health plan instead of automatically enrolling in Medicaid is a disservice to ourcitizens. Health insurance coverage rules are complex and often opaque to the average person at the time they purchase a policy. Many don't know exactly what is covered and what will beapplied to deductible and copay until after they have had the medical service. Moreover, theyare complete unaware of the services the are likely to need and how much those services willcost. Medicaid coverage is easy to understand and transparent. It is accepted essentially everywhere in the state. There is no need to worry about network coverage. For the vast majority ofIdahoans, the medicaid option is going to be far superior coverage. If the 1332 waiver is granted, t will be absolutely critical for citizens who are potentially faced with the decision to have as much information as possible on likely maladies, their costs, andthe difference in coverage between the average silver plan and their medicaid option. For thesmall slice of citizens who wish to continue a QHP and are appropriate candidates, the cost ofadministration the waiver will far outweigh any potential savings to the state. Scott Dunn MD Sandpoint, IdahoFrom: Tracy Olson To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 17, 2019 8:00:19 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Dear DOI Product Review Bureau Chief,I believe Mediciad Expansion provides far more reliable and valuable healthcare coverage than exchange-based plans. The subsidized plans come with large co-pays and even larger deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. I know people are concerned with providing people \"choice\" which is the basis of this waiver, however, I believe this waiver will confuse thousands of working class citizens who may be denied information about the benefits ofMedicaid Expansion. They may also be denied healthcare coverage if they stay on exchange-based plans and fail topay for premiums.2. I am very concerned whether or not thousands of working Idahoans will be given a clear explanation about the differences of the private versus Medicaid plans. I am very concerned about the transparency and availability of information regarding the choices presented to them. If working Idahoans don't have access to the pros and cons of subsidized insurance versus Medicaid Expansion at the same time either is offered, then then I don't think this is a valid \"choice\". I remain concerned that there is not language in the law that protects consumers from misleading information or protection against predatory insurance providers who are not required to disclose all available options for consumers. There are far too many details lacking in this waiver and with unclear process that consumers would face, I strongly encourage a denial of this 1332 waiver application .

The waivers place a burden on individuals that are already struggling for various reasons. The intricacies of the system with the waivers appears to be designed to inhibit those most vulnerable from accessing care.

They are elected officials. Elected by their constituents. Their constituents voted on a citizen initiative that put on the November ballot to approve a cleanexpansion on Medicaid. That seems to be unclear because the GOP legislators then placed waivers on the expansion. They were elected to represent their constituents but chose not to. So. We'll deal with that next November. In the meanwhile, things might go better if those waivers inflicted on the undiagnosed working poor forced into a second gap by GOP legislators carry a few restrictions as now possible.

Medicaid supplies superior coverage to other plans with similar cost but there is unfortunately a stigma associated with the name of Medicaid so this waiver will likely result in fewer people enrolling for Medicaid to the detriment of their personal finances and the system at large as many of these people will inevitably end up uninsuredand will therefore likely receive healthcare in cost inefficient manners such as via emergency departments or hospitalizations. More barriers to entry into the Medicaid pool simply serve to complicate the process and we should be seeking streamlined simplistic government, not bloated systems with multiple layers of complexity builtin. Fortunately, simple in this scenario will also result in better health outcomes and cost savings, so rejecting thiswaiver is a no brainer.

Willoway Dr.Boise To: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 12, 2019 4:40:06 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am asking the DOI to reconsider more efforts to complicate the medicaid expansion that Idahoans overwhelmingly voted for. The 1332 Waiver Application is another way to open up Idahoans who meet the Medicaid threshold to exploitation by private interests. They are citizens of the great state of Idaho, but too often the legislature and the organs of government take the opportunity to open them up to exploitation. We understand where legislative dollars come from for election and re election campaigns. We also understand that bureaucracies are heavily influenced by these same forces, but where is the moral compass of those who enact andadministrate these programs? Does it reside with special interests, in this case private and for profit insurancecompanies, or with the interests of the citizens of Idaho, those who are the true constituency? DOI action on thisissue will determine where the department stands. Are you with private insurance companies and ideologues whoexploit Idahoans for profit, or are you with the citizenry? Your actions will determine where you stand.

The 1332 waiver as I understand could give Idahoans between 100-138% federal poverty level the option to receive a tax credit for coverage on the state exchange, and pay premiums and copays, instead of enrolling in Medicaid. I signed a petition and voted for Medicaid expansion in Idaho without 'sideboards' such as the 1332 waiver. We need a healthy population who has access to wellness care and peace of mind that more severe health problems will be resolved. We business owners need healthy employees. All of us need a population with vaccinations and prompt care for communicable disease. I expect most Idaho working poor do not make enough money to even qualify for tax credits. The 'sideboard' plan embedded in the 1332 waiver is simply a scam to keep more Idaho working poor without health coverage, reduce the real support they need to fully participate in the economy and cost them more through sideboard copays or premiums. The unfunded mandate of a 1332 waiver would add taxpayer costs to create or expand an agency to provide options information to Idahoans. Sideboard costs for low-income Idahoans would be like an imposed tax. A non-sideboard Medicaid expansion would be less costly and connect low-wage Idahoans directly with the healthcare they needwithout bureaucratic burden. The purpose of the Idaho Department of Insurance is to protect consumers, not add roadblocks or increase costs.Sincerely,Laurence Gebhardt 1200 Aspen Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 12, 2019 3:01:05 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Cost sharing and premium assistance, which exchange coverage will require a monthly premium and financial obligations clearly is not an affordable option for FPL Idahoans. Furthermore, tax credits made available to FPL Idahoans without many means who need coverage should not be forced to decline private coverage and/or jump through additional paperwork hoops. Medicaid already makes coverage demands that impose financial barriers. Require medications to be filled in short durartions, require repeatedly, making office visists to PCP to renew prescriptions and when on several medications requires frequent phone calls, appointments, transportation, hasturned to requiring FPL Medicaid Idahoans making several trips montlly and yearly.A marketplace offer of plans to FPL individuals offers significantly higher out-of-pocket costs than in Medicaid,making going to the doctor or filling a prescription an existential and added finanacial choice as it stands.Research on cost-sharing for the FPL Medicaid beneficiaries, reduces access to care, and most important necessaryservices.Due to the available funds of FPL Idahoan the cost of health insurance is astronomical. At the specificied enrollmentdate eligible FPL Idahoans already have completed the yearly process and documented, certified FPL fulfill theMedicare coverage guidelines.

Idahoans need an easy enrollment process that won't put doctors in the role of deciding who deservescoverage, who can work, and who cannot.

It must be done in a way that is very simple, that assures that Idahoans understand their choices, and that actively works to alleviate barriers. I do not support waivers that include copays; first accessing the health care exchange; or other policies and procedures that make access and usage difficult. Sincerely,Carol Omel 1011 N 5th Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019 3:50:06 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am writing to oppose granting the requested Waiver. The category of Idahoans who will be retained by their current coverage will miss out on expanded coverage, additional benefits, lower costs and co-pays and generally noteven know what they are losing. Those in Idaho who need the dependability of affordable and inclusive coverageshould not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid. Potential enrollees need to be shown a clear choiceand the pathway towards Medicaid coverage at the time of enrollment.It is important that, if the waiver is granted, full information be available in simple language prior to making healthcoverage choices: wan missing premiums result in loss of health insurance? What are co-pays? It needs a chartcomparing private coverage vs. Medicaid.This is a relatively unsophisticated population, often with poor information sources. It should be automatic or verysimple for them to make their health insurance choice that will result in highest coverage with lowest cost to them.This is also a group that can afford very little healthcare at retail prices and avoids treatment because of cost. It is also very is susceptible to bankruptcy if costs soar. I encourage you to deny this waiver request. If you decide to grant it, build in full safeguards for consumers. That isthe group you are charged with protecting and representing.

I do not know if private policies are as comprehensive, but fear they are not, asinsurance companies are in business to make money, not to help people.

Consider the fact that many folks do not have that luxury of their employers which they worked for, to provide good health insurance during retirement, OR the companies simply did not have health plans or benefits, as the companies were small family businesses. The employees currently working under the same scenarios as noted above are struggling with the high costs of health care, when they or their children become sick. Many private plans have high premiums, plus high deductibles, so low wager earners are forced to forego even basic health insurance.It is time for the State of Idaho to assist its' citizens to cope with the health-care costs that they are being subjected to, when receiving health care. As we know, many low-income folks avoid doctors due to the costs of treatment. Adults or children should not have to chose between housing and food versus health costs.The Idaho Department of Innsurance must consider the voice of Idaho's voters to expand Medicaid, and not require applicants to decline exchange insurance before comparing the private insurance costs and benefits versus Medicaidcosts and benefits, and therefore withdraw its' restrictive waiver application numbered 1332 ...

I have been using the Idaho exchange since I retired early a few years ago, so I am familiar with how this exchange is evolving. Medicaid is a much better solution for people in this group than the private plans on the Idaho exchange.Comprehensive coverage: As I study the exchange each year, and the waiver developments, it is clear to me that the plans offered on the exchange include plans with poor coverage. Medicaid is comprehensive. Process: And it requires a master sleuth to figure out which ones are good, solid coverage, and which ones do not offer solid coverage of the ten essential benefits outlined in the ACA. I don't think anyone should have to applyguesswork to choosing health insurance, especially the vulnerable people in this particular group who are so busytrying to make ends meet and who may be dealing with health issues. Affordability/Dependability: The monthly payments required on the exchange will be problematic (in terms of understanding/complying with the process and in terms of making the payments) for this group and will certainlyknock people off of coverage. That just isn't right. Thank you.Sincerely,Brenda Foster 723 N Hillview DrBoise, ID 83712 From: To: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019 9:10:08 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am 71 years old, my husband is 81. We have an adequate income to pay our supplemental insurance as well as Medicare. Even with our \"comfortable\" income, I cannot imagine how devastating medical bills would have been over the past few years. We simply would not have been able to pay them, which means someone else would have - other tax payers whether through taxes or increased medical charges. I firmly believe basic medical care should be available to all. It would not only keep costs down by decreasing emergency and critical care, but is the humanitarian thing to do. I am very willing to pay more in taxes to this end. NO WAIVER!

Sincerely,patricia To: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019 7:40:09 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Idahoans of modest means deserve better health coverage than 1332. Using 100-138% of the federal poverty level is weak and does very little to provide health care to our most vulnerable neighbors, family and friends. Who in the legislature could afford insurance with this income? Medicaid will benefit our fellow Idahoans in need, and be an economic driver for our state. Further, I voted for Medicaid expansion along with 61% or so of my neighbors. Please adhere to the will of the voters. Idaho needs to get moving and deliver 21st century opportunities to our people. Sincerely,Liz Keegan PO Box 8010Ketchum, ID 83340 From: Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019 2:00:08 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Medicaid expansion should be implemented without waivers. If the Idaho exchange is offered in place of or in first position to Medicaid expansion, less people will be covered and Idahoans will struggle to understand, pay for andaccess healthcare. I know lots of people who have not signed up for exchange plans because they can't understandhow to do it, miss the deadline or believe they don't qualify. I have used the Idaho insurance exchange since it came online and even after using the system for several years, it's still difficult to figure out how to select a plan that is appropriate and will provide good coverage that is affordable. Ihave helped many people access the exchange because the plans are confusing and complex with variouscompanies, their plans, their copays, co-insurance percentages, out-of pocket maxes, deductibles, premiums, tiers,doctor lists, coverage areas, etc... Understanding who qualifies can also be tricky. Even the brokers who are hired byIdaho to answer questions about the exchange are very limited in their knowledge, especially in a rural area. Another problem with the plans is that the costs have risen exponentially each year. Many of us will be priced out and will be forced to buy a bronze plan or similar that only kicks in after a huge deductible is met. Predicting futureincome is required on the exchange and that is often difficult. I have struggled to do this for myself and my 20-year-old, who attends college and works a summer job. The exchange also requires a stable monthly income. A friend told me today that she lost her coverage last month because she is taking time off work to be with her newborn, so her tax credit (APTC) was cancelled while she is on leave making the premium cost-prohibitive. Her baby has coverage on Medicaid, but she will be uncovered until shegoes back to work in August (maybe even for the calendar year, I will have to check on it because I helped her signup for the exchange). I am currently trying to help a coworker who is separated from his wife as he tries to sign up for insurance. She doesn't want to pay to keep him on her company's insurance and cancelled him from the policy. He says he is beingtold by Idaho's exchange that he does not qualify since he has insurance available through his wife's company. Shedoesn't want to keep him on her plan, so I'm not sure what he will do. He has been uninsured since April 1. My company's president, who does not offer health insurance, did not realize most of her employees qualified to get affordable insurance through the exchange. I had to explain that to her last fall and at the last moment she passedaround information telling people I would help them sign up, even though I don't have any special knowledge about the exchanges, except using them. I moved to Idaho after I was laid off from a career in another state. I had always had company-sponsored insurance. I was only able to acquire part-time low-wage jobs in Idaho when I moved here and had to purchase healthinsurance for several hundred dollars each month, which was really only catastrophic coverage in nature. It coveredalmost nothing and had a high deductible equal to my entire year of earnings. My son, on the other hand, qualifiedfor Medicaid. Everything was covered for him. I am glad I was able to stay healthy to raise him while I had thecrummy insurance (that didn't cover doctor visits or medicine). I'm also glad that he had health care during thoseyears. His coverage on Medicaid was excellent and it was not difficult to access. I hope you will consider giving Idahoans healthcare that is accessible and affordable and not require them to go through the exchange, which is difficult to access, getting more expensive, is under constant legislative attack andjudicial scrutiny and which, is not currently working in the way it was intended. If you insist on putting the exchange in first position, be sure to inform people that Medicaid will be easier to sign up for, will not be cancelled if you can't pay a monthly premium or you need to stay home with your newborn and will cover more services thanthe exchanges!Sincerely, Laura Embry 617 S A StGrangeville, ID 83530 From: Daniel Pierce To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 10, 2019 7:50:07 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Please incorporate the Medicaid gap coverage as close as possible to what we (Idahoans) voted on and PASSED last November in the Idaho General Election.

We the voters, then voted for Medicaid Expansion. Congress is not listening to us and this is not acceptable. I work with seniors who sometimes need an extra hand. If we do not have the options to assist them, they will end up homeless, without medical care, etc. Medicaid offers more affordability and stability than plans on the exchange Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium anddeductibles. These financial obligations must be clearly explained to this portion of the Medicaid eligible populationin Idaho.Idahoans who need the dependability of affordable and inclusive coverage should not have to decline privatecoverage to access Medicaid.While marketplace plans offer cost-sharing assistance to low-income individuals, these individuals would still facesignificantly higher out-of-pocket costs than in Medicaid, making it more difficult to afford going to the doctor orfilling a prescription.Research shows that even relatively small levels of cost-sharing on Medicaid beneficiaries, ranging from $1 to $5,are associated with reduced use of care, including necessary services.Nearly 10,000 Idahoans today are eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange but don't, most likely due to the costof health insurance. Idahoans should be shown a clear choice and pathway towards Medicaid coverage at the time ofenrollment.Idahoans need a transparent and unbiased enrollment process and have a clear pathway to Medicaid coverageWill Idahoans be informed that if they fail to pay their premiums they could lose their coverage?

As retired family physicians with 50 years each of medical practice behind us and thus have grave concern that many eligible Idahoans will be blindsided into remaining with their previous insurance plans without realizing that they will have premiums and deductibles to pay and could lose their coverage if they fail to make payments in time and that their coverage will not be as complete as Medicaid coverage. It is critical for the government to carry out an understandable, accurate public education campaign to adequately inform Idahoans currently falling into the gap between 100 and 138% of poverty level about these risks they will incur if they opt out of Medicaid Expansion.

Please set the ideology aside and made decisions based on the facts. The proposed restrictions are an example of useless overhead that does not lead to better health or lower costs.

Idahoans deserve access to Medicaid . I am in favor of reliability and access and lower costs, which is why you should comply with the law and provide the access to Medicaid that Idahoans have requested. Citizens worked really hard to get the petition signatures. It is wrong for legislators or the Governor to restrict resources that citizens requested. The efforts of state government to impede democracy are wrong and erode the confidence of the public. Legislative actions to restrict Medicaid make me mistrust state government in Idaho.

I believe that people shouldn't be afraid of losing their insurance coverage due to difficulty paying their premiums. Some of these people's income isn't as stable as we would like it to be. In addition, I don't agree that someone applying for medicaid should be penalized in any way shape or form. Everyone should be well educated about the choices they have to insure their family. I believe that Medicaid would offer more stability for those families. Did you know that nearly 10,000.00 are eligible to purchase insurance on the exchange and don't. This may be due to misinformation or also an inability to afford insurance that offers subsidies. This country has proven itself to be innovative and creative in so many ways. It is hard to understand that in the area of health care it lets itself be bullied by insurance companies and their interests rather than by its citizens needs.

In 2018 the people of the State of Idaho passed a referendum for medicad expansion to help those in need get the basic medical care they deserve and shouldbe entitled to. For many in the gap, the jobs they have do not allow for paid leave or sick days, making basic medicalcare without sideboards (or the requirements placed on the program via the 1332 Waiver Application). Specifically Ibelieve: - Medicaid offers better services and benefits to Idahoans with mental illness than private insurance. This is critical for Idaho as we are relying on our jails to deal with mentally ill citizens instead of offering them the affordable carethey deserve.- Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium anddeductibles. These financial obligations are often barriers to accessing the medical coverage they need.- Safeguards must be in place to ensure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of state legislators, insurancecompanies or others with a vested financial interest. Thanks in advance for considering my comments.Sincerely,Harold Witt 2437 W Teano Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 10, 2019 12:40:11 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I oppose the 1332 waiver because it would lead to a denser State bureaucracy, one already with a history of erratic and sometimes faint sensitivity to the needs of the poorest and most ill in Idaho.

Sincerely,patricia Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 10, 2019 12:30:12 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Please don't add sidebars to the Idaho Medicaid expansion.I had the opportunity to attend the joint listening session in front of the House Health & Welfare committee during the legislative session. The testimony we heard was compelling. I really hope that the Idaho Legislators and the Governor will allow the expansion of Medicaid to happen as voted for by the Idaho voters without sidebars and restrictions. As Sam Sandmire said in that joint session: \"The people of Idaho voted for you, and you didn't try to change THAT result!\" Are there people who abuse the system? Yes! But there are also people that NEED the system the way it wasintended to work without work requirements etc.When I worked at a large Cancer Treatment Center as a Nurse Practitioner it was heartbreaking to hear of those thatwere undergoing treatment while trying to hold down a job so they wouldn't lose their insurance. Chemo today and work tomorrow is HARD! We also had patients who had lost their private insurance because they had lost their jobs and then relied on medicaid after all their personal funds/savings were depleted. Then I meet a friend whose child had a cleft palate and other developmental delays while my oldest child was an infant. I helped her navigate themedicaid and welfare system. It was HARD! She and her son needed help, not more hoops to jump through.62.1 % of all bankruptcies in 2017 were because of medical bills. We need a change in the system, BUT notexpanding medicaid in Idaho is not the right change. And adding a work requirement is going to harm those alreadyat risk. Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premiumand deductibles. These financial obligations must be clearly explained to this portion of the Medicaid eligiblepopulation in Idaho.Idahoans who need the dependability of affordable and inclusive coverage should not have to decline privatecoverage to access Medicaid.

Sincerely,Mary Jane Marlow Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Friday, June 7, 2019 11:50:09 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, As an Idahoan constituent, I oppose waiver 1332 for eligible Idaho citizens. They should be clearly informed of options and pros and cons of Medicaid versus private insurance before having to make a choice. I support Medicaid coverage for all eligible Idahoans over private insurance and they should be give an option to be automaticallyenrolled upon meeting qualifications. Medicaid would give better benefits at a lower and more stable cost, and theywould have more reliable and dependable coverage. Private insurance exchanges do not have the best interests of their clients at heart, but rather more concerned with profits. I OPPOSE WAIVER 1332.

The referendum passed with NO restrictions on implementation. The legislature,which FAILED for years to pass ANY legislation in this matter,decided to add \"waivers\" to override the will/intent of the electorate.

The people of Idaho strongly endorsed expandingMedicaid in our state without any additional stipulations.

If someone falls under the poverty guidelines they should be able to automatically qualify and obtain medicaid. Marketplace insurance should not be an option due to the fact that premiums/co pays still need to be paid which goes back to not being able toafford.

Sincerely,Louise Seeley Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 4, 2019 11:00:11 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I have recently been diagnosed with a complicated tumor which will require surgery followed by radiation treatments. I have private insurance and right now I can afford the monthly payments. I hope my ability to pay remains.As a result of the tumor discovery I have been immersed in visiting doctors, specialists, and succumbing to various medical tests which require multiple co-pays. Multiple. While the co-pays are adding up, I have the funds to cover them. So far. I am on a retiree's income. For those in the poverty bracket, these co pays can feed their families. I am not one of the Idahoans within the 138% of the FPL. If I was within this bracket, the ability to pay monthly payments is ludicrous. If I was within this bracket, the co-pays would break me.For those in the monetary bracket noted above, Medicaid offers more affordability and stability. Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium and deductibles. I amconcerned that those in the FPL will not be able to make the financial obligations. As taxpayers, we'll pay for it in the long run. I do not support 1332 as it wastes taxpayer money. I am retired and as result I am not in a situation where I would lose my job due to work absences. If I was workingthere would be absences due to the location of the tumor as it does cause debilitating pain at times. Being retiredalso has allowed me to wade through the assortment of insurance info in order to understand it. Its critical thateducation about the choices one has for insurance be made available to those in need in Idaho. What is the educationand information process? Insurance is complicated. Its frightening enough to deal with a medical issue, let aloneworking to decipher insurance jargon when your quality of life depends on it. I do not support 1332, its inefficient, doesn't serve Idahoans wells and will cost taxpayers money in the long run.

Confuse the citizen, make the citizen jump through hoops, then blame the citizen for not being insured. This technique is especially cruel forthose who have mental illness. This is not what we voted on last November. Yet our state congress was hell-bent to put their mark on the citizen initiative. No amount of expert opinion, constituent experience, common sense, or overwhelming support for the Medicaid expansion as voted on could persuade them to not add their personal stamp of bureaucracy and hoops as well as costs to the taxpayers. If we must have this application process, make it simple, make it clean, make it well known and do not put time restrictions on it. Imagine your intelligent, beautiful daughter who lives courageously with mental illness just cut herself. Again.

No waiver!! Sincerely,Rhonda Rohe 1076 Schroeder To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Friday, June 21, 2019 11:40:20 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I oppose the 1332 waiver for several reasons. 1. Medicaid is a more stable, comprehensive form of insurance than low cost plans on the exchange. Co-pays and premiums associated with private policies are burdensome for families, and may cause loss of coverage due to inability to pay. Why not minimize the number of uninsured or underinsured in Idaho by enrolling eligible residentsin Medicaid? 2. While this waiver claims to offer \"choice,\" it is unclear if the vast differences in coverage options will be appropriately explained to eligible recipients. Additionally, many Idahoans choose to remain uninsured altogetherrather than utilize the exchange. No one ever plans on a catastropic diagnosis or accident--but people actually needhealth insurance coverage even if they don't realize their need for a safety net (see Idaho CAT budget, and CountyIndigent Care budgets for evidence). Preventative, managed care is both cheaper and better for patients thanemergency room care. A clean Medicaid expansion, as approved by voters, will leave the fewest number ofuninsured individuals in Idaho. 3. Medicaid is the most cost effective way to cover this population. The 1332 waiver jeopardizes the savings we hope to see from Medicaid Expansion by creating a secondary coverage gap. Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely, Rebecca Schroeder Sincerely,Rebecca Schroeder 663 W Combine WayCoeur d ID To: DOI Reform Subject: ID 1332 Waiver Date: Friday, June 21, 2019 1:20:27 PM Attachments: ID ACOG Comments_CoverageChoiceWaiver.pdf Hello, The attached comment letter is submitted on behalf of the Idaho Section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, representing more than 120 practicing obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns).

Cameron Director, Idaho Department of Insurance 700 West State Street, 3rd Floor P.O. Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720 -0043 RE: Idaho ACOG Comments on the Idaho Department of Insurance Coverage Choice Waiver Application Dear Directo r Cameron , The Idaho Section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), representing more than 120 practicing obstetrician -gynecologists (ob -gyns), welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Idaho Department of Insurance's (DOI) C overage Choice Waiver Application . As physicians dedicated to providing quality care to women, we are concerned that the proposed waiver may negatively impact affordability and coverage for our patients with incomes between 100 -138 percent of the federal p overty level (FPL). We urge the state to follow the will of the voters and prioritize the most affordable and comprehensive health care options for its citizens. It is with these goals in mind that we submit the following comments. While Idaho's state -based exchange , Your Health Idaho, has successfully provided coverage to more than 85,000 Idahoans over the past five years, coverage gaps remain. To help fill these gaps, Idaho voters in November 2018 overwhelmingly passed Proposition 2, a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid as intended under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Since the passage of Proposition 2, the Idaho legislature passed SB 1204, a bill which requires the Idaho DOI to submit this waiver request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servic es (CMS). ACOG is concerned that this waiver, by seeking authority to allow the expansion population to remain in their Your Health Idaho plans with federal subsidies, does not promote the most affordable and comprehensive health care options to its citi zens. Roughly 10,000 Idahoans who are currently eligible for coverage on Your Health Idaho have not purchased a plan because the coverage is too expensive. Notably, even with the assistance of advanced premium tax credits, plans on the exchange are still m ore expensive than Medicaid. This is due, in part, to exchange plan's premiums, deductibles, and other cost -sharing requirements that typically do not apply to Medicaid. Idaho Section 2 Indeed, a n adult with income at or around the federal poverty line usually would not have to pay any premiums for Medicaid coverage, but could be required to pay two percent, or $243 annually in 2019, for the benchmark exchange plan. This makes accessing coverage and health care services costly and could cause some people who end up in exchange plans to delay or avoid needed care due to cost. Alternatively , these individuals could have trouble paying their premiums throughout the year, leaving them uninsured when their exchange plan is terminated. In addition to higher rates of cost -sharing, exchange coverage provides fewer comprehensive benefits than Medicaid. For example, Medicaid covers non -emergency medical transportation to ensure that lack of transportation does not prevent low-income adults from getting to the doctor. This is an i mportant benefit, as 3.6 million people miss or delay medical care each year because they lack available or affordable transportation.1 This is particularly important for low -income pregnant women , who frequently cite lack of transportation as a barrier to accessing care.2 Medicaid also offers more comprehensive coverage for behavioral and mental health needs, including treatment for substance use disorder. These benefits are vital to the health of our patients and are simply not guaranteed to be offered in all exchange plans. Lastly , we believe that the proposed waiver fails to meet the deficit neutrality standard that is required of all state relief and empowerment waivers.3 Specifically, because many Idahoans will be eligible for Medicaid expansion effe ctive January 1, 2020, and because, under current law , people with incomes between 100 -138 percent FPL will be eligible for Medicaid and not subsidized coverage on Your Health Idaho, the baseline assumption (against which this waiver is judged) is inherent ly flawed. The state should instead assume that these individuals will be covered through Medicaid rather than purchasing health insurance on the state -based exchange. By altering this assumption, it becomes clear that the proposal is not deficit neutral. This is confirmed by Idaho's 2018 proposal for a different waiver, where t he state's analysis found that it would cost the federal government $7,700 per -person per -year to cover the 100 -138 percent FPL income group in subsidized exchange plans in 2019.4 To cover the same group via Medicaid expansion in 2019 was projected to cost the federal government $3,878 per -person per -year.5 Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the Idaho DOI's Coverage Choice Waiver Application. I hope you have found o ur comments useful. While we understand that various elements of this waiver are legislatively mandated, we encourage you to reconsider your request and to instead honor the will of the voters and move forward with Medicaid expansion as intended.

June 24, 2019 Product Review Bureau Chief Department of Insurance PO Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720- 0043 Re: Idaho Department of Insurance Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver, Notice of Public Hearing and Public Comment Period Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing on behalf of Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in response to the Idaho Department of Insurance Notice of Public Hearing and Public Comment Period to bring your attention to a p otential unintended consequence of the proposed Section 1332 Coverage Choice Waiver. The proposed waiver would add to the federal deficit , going against an explicit requirement of waiver proposals under Section 1332. Idahoans pride themselves on being fiscally responsible, giving everyone a fair shot, and lending a helping hand when their neighbor is facing a hard time. Each of these contribute to broadly shared opportunity and an economy that is strong and sustainable for Idaho's future. Idahoans voted to expand Medicaid in 2018, providing health coverage to 91,000 residents earning less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) so they can see a doctor when they need to. Medicaid expansion will generate savings to the state CAT Fund, behavioral health services, community based substance use disorder treatment for offenders, and mental health services for the probation and parole population.1 By creating new jobs and increasing economic activity across the state, Medicaid expansion will increase state tax revenue by more than enough to cover Idaho's investment beginning in FY 2022, the first year full savings are realized.2,3 Any changes to Medicaid expansion as passed by the voters would influence the se projected fiscal impacts and must be thoroughly vetted. The proposed waiver would allow people who are eligible for Medicaid expansion earning between 100-138% FPL to purchase private insurance on the health exchange instead and receive subsidies to help offset some of the cost. These Idahoans would likely pay more to visit the doctor through a private plan purchased on the exchange than they would through Medicaid. While an adult with income at the poverty line usually does not have a premium under Medicaid, they could be required to pay hundreds of dollars annually for the benchmark plan available on the exchange. Customers would also have fewer wrap around services with exchange plans, like transportation to and from medical appointments . Millions of people miss or delay medical care every year because of transportation barriers, which is an acute challenge in Idaho given its rural and remote landscape.4 The proposed waiver application indicates that people would be told of their option to enroll in Medicaid only after declining private insurance, which would miss many people who may not start the enrollment process at all because they assume they can't afford private insurance. Residents who do seek out private insurance through the exchange may Advisory Board Michelle Britton Hal Bunderson Steve Burgos Jerry Evans Bev Sue Lovelace Christine Loucks Bob Maynard Karan Tucker Rich Toney Director Lauren Necochea 1607 W Jefferson St Boise, ID 83702 Ph: idahocfp.org later lose coverage as they are unable to afford cost sharing requirements that would not be present under Medicaid. Fewer coverage gains would mean that the full savings to the CAT Fund and other state programs anticipated under unmodified expansion may not be realized under the proposed waiver. If customers are not fully informed of their eligibility for both health coverage options and made aware of their differences, participants may also fluctuate between Medicaid and the exchange. The proposal does not take this in to account and instead assumes static enrollment on the exchange. The proposal also does not appear to take in to account that health care providers would have an incentive to steer sicker, higher-cost patients to private plans on the exchange to receive higher reimbursement levels. This would drive up the cost of private health care for all Idahoans and may further increase uninsured rates among those without a subsidy on the exchange . For these reasons, the waiver application does not appear to show the true burden of the proposal on federal funding. Medicaid expansion is less costly to the federal government than tax credits through the exchange for Idahoans with incomes between 100-138% FPL. The state estimated in 2018 that it would cost the federal government $3,822 more per person per year to cover residents earning 100-138% FPL with subsidized exchange plans when compared to Medicaid.5 The application claims that the federal government would save money under the waiver because people would move from the exchange to Medicaid. However, this inaccurately assumes that residents receiving tax credits would not be eligible for Medicaid expansion without the proposed waiver . The passage of Proposition 2 in 2018 ensures that without the proposed waiver Idahoans earning 100-138% of FPL poverty would be eligible for Medicaid and therefore no longer eligible for subsidized exchange coverage. By allowing this group of people to claim a monthly tax credit to cover their premium costs, the proposed waiver will increase federal spending relative to current law even though waivers under Section 1332 are required to be deficit neutral to the federal government. We encourage the state to take this information in to account and adjust its waiver application to reflect the true cost to the federal government. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly at or with any questions regarding the presented concerns. Respectfully, Sasha Pierson, MSc Policy Analyst 1 Milliman, Inc. (2018, July 19).

I don't understand how anyone with such low income could afford not to enroll In Medicaid which has far better coverage than the cheapest available plans on the exchange and doesn't require any premium payment or co payments. I would hope if this waiver is approved, that the applicant would be fully informed of the the costs and coverage associated with private insurance versus those of Medicaid, so he or she could make the best decision possible for his/her own situation. In addition I also object to the work requirements imposed by this waiver on Medicaid applicants. Most of them already work low income jobs and often have no control over their work schedules. What happens if the worker becomes ill temporarily and his income falls below the 20 hours per week x $7.25 per hour?What happens if the person is laid off and hasn't worked long enough or earned enough to qualify for unemployment benefits? What ifanother job, volunteer opportunity or training program is not immediately available? That worker could lose medical coverage when he needs it most. If the 60% of voters who voted for the Medicaid Expansion Initiative wanted restrictive work requirements and barriers to qualifying for Medicaid they would not have voted for the initiative.The legislature, in proposing this waiver is disregarding the will of the people.

A vulnerable member of Idaho's population. A mentally ill individual who somehow managed to gain full-time employment. A person who at any moment could find themselves right backinto working part-time non-benefitted positions due to the nature of my disability. Someone who has been on thehealth exchange and had to abandon it because the market destabilized. How does offering me a tax credit for theexchange offer me any security? The answer is, it doesn't. Politicians in Washington are still attempting to discredit,destabilize, and destroy the affordable care act. It makes no sense to deny those like me true Medicaid expansion,representing a measure Idahoans fought hard to bring to a ballot measure. The people have spoken. It is time to stopthese outrageous sideboards and proposals that essentially fly in the face of democracy. It insults the integrity and the intelligence of the Idahoans that fought hard for Medicaid expansion. My story is this. I cannot afford to go off of my medications or (I've been told) I will destabilize and deteriorate tothe point of potential hospitalization. This is terrifying to me. To have the knowledge that many Idahoans fought forMedicaid expansion helps me sleep at night. Offering people like me a credit for a program that is currently underattack gives me nightmares. I can't imagine what it's like for others with physical and mental medical issues,previously in the gap, to hear that our leadership is still proposing alternatives to what was already hard won. Therewere similar alternatives brought to the legislature, like the Idaho Health Care Plan, that never made it to a vote onthe floor. The time for alternatives is over. Implement full Medicaid expansion now.

Sincerely,Joanie Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Friday, June 21, 2019 3:00:15 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, The process for Medicaid expansion should be simple and easy. Individuals and families either qualify by income or they don't. We don't need to add layers of bureaucracy regarding cost sharing, dealing with the exchanges, etc. We do need public service campaigns that help people learn to access and use their medicaid benefit. Idahoans tax money should be used to assure that low income people get health care-not by devising ways to prevent them from eligibility. Keep it simple!!! Sincerely,Carol Omel 1011 N 5th To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 24, 2019 10:50:27 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I voted for a clean Medicaid expansion bill and see no reason to burden Idahoans who NEED medicaid. I am a volunteer with St. Vincent De Paul and see many low income families who needed Medicaid to be expanded.These families can not afford to have co-pays of even $5.00, they live paycheck to paycheck and sometimes it doesn't stretch that far if the car breaks down, the power bill is bigger than planned for etc. If these additional costs go into effect I believe we are doing these families more harm than good. THIS IS NOT WHAT I VOTED FOR WHEN I VOTED FOR A CLEAN MEDICAID EXPANSION. These are our fellow taxpaying Idahoan families that we are going to add another financial punch to.I think that these families need the chance to benefit from having Medicaid and get themselves healthy before we ask them to pay for healthcare. Thank you for reading this. I write from the place of having been uninsured with huge medical bills to becominginsured under the Affordable Care Act, so I believe I am qualified to speak to this issue.

You have heard a great deal about the benefits of Medicaid compared to Your Health Idaho plans. I have been using Your Health Idaho for several years and checked into the exact numbers for people in the expansion. You may be surprised, but it should make the case for Medicaid instead of the ACA:First, 2 numbers to remember: $35,535 - 138% of household income for a family of four $15,800 - the deductible in the lowest priced plan available Here is the scenario: A young couple in Sandpoint, both 35 years old, have two young children. He works full time making $14/hour and she works half time at $7.25/hour. Their annual income is $35,250, just about at 138% of poverty level. Good news! At this income, the are eligible for an insurance subsidy of $901 per month! That sounds like free healthcare! Time to celebrate. But Wait! The lowest priced bronze plan still costs $54.40 per month. On top of that, the deductible is $15,800. Let that sink in. This couple has to pay over $650 in premiums and then pay every single dollar beyond their wellness visits with their own money. Every. Single. Dollar. Up to $15,800 on an income of $35,250. Sprained ankle? Pay in cash. Shoulder pain that requires an X-ray? Pay in cash. Birth control? Pay in cash. Medication? Pay in cash. Every single dollar of health care is paid by them until they pay $15,800. Remember, they are barely above the poverty level. I checked other counties, and the payments are higher, meaning the situation can be even worse. Think about it. $35,250 income, minus taxes, housing, car, insurance, food, utilities. And minus $650 in premiums and up to $15,800 in deductibles. This is not reasonable. We are Idahoans. We believe in work. We believe in taking care of our families. Hard working Idahoans in the 100% - 138% of poverty income, who love their families and jobs but barely make ends meet, may choose to notpurchase health care coverage on the exchange or go to the doctor in a timely manner, risking their ability to work and contribute to society as they always planned. This is a shame. There is a better way. The better way to help this family is to provide health care coverage through Medicaid, as allowed by the ACA and as allowed by the Prop 2 initiative passed by Idaho citizens in 2018. It enables more people to work without fear of medical bankruptcy or making a trade-off between food and a doctor visit. It enables more people to contribute to the great state of Idaho. The Section 1332 Waiver helps no one, especially not Idaho and those here who want to work. It should not be allowed. Sincerely,Cindy MuellerBoise, ID Sincerely,Cindy Mueller 2950 From: Page To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 24, 2019 12:40:07 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am a physician and wish to oppose the 1332 waiver for a number of reasons. First, the waiver was not part of the inter of the ballot measure as voted for by a large majority of Idahoans in the last election. Secondly, exchange products may not have benefits which are a s comprehensive as those offered via Medicaid. The process of comparing benefits and costs of exchange products is difficult and confusing. The inclusion of copays and deductibles with exchange products will discourage many who cannot afford them when the time comes to seek care. This delays care, and results in avoidance of preventive health efforts. The result is increased cost to the patient and to the system. It is reasonable to offer an exchange option for those who prefer it and can avoid it, but Medicaid should also be a first option without having to first opt out of the exchange. Sincerely,Randell Page 1826 S Travertine WayBoise, ID 83712 From: To: Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 24, 2019 7:00:27 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Rural Idaho hospitals and clinics are closing, primarily in rural areas of our great State of Idaho. This has been aggravated by failure to expand Medicaid in Idaho, entirely due to Republican obstinance. While rural Americans often tell reporters that they feel neglected and ignored by big-city coastal elites, the people preventing them from getting health care aren't in New York or D.C., they're in their own state capitals. This waiver request is just one more example of our broken system, with large donors calling the shots, hurting Idaho residents. But why are Republican state-level politicians so determined to punish their own base? As I said, it's not about the money: Rejecting the Medicaid expansion actually costs a state jobs and hence revenue. And refusing to cover folks making slightly more than the poverty level is perverse. Medicaid offers more affordability and stability than plans on the exchange. Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium and deductibles. These financial obligations must be clearly explained to this portion of the Medicaid eligible population in Idaho. Idahoans who need the dependable and inclusive coverage should not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid.Requests of this waiver reflects Republican meanspiritedness, an embrace of cruelty, that was already infecting the G.O.P. even before Donald Trump, and has now become one of the party's defining traits. Yes, that's harsh, but you know that it's true. Will Idahoans be informed that if they fail to pay their premiums they could lose their coverage? How will enrollees know the kinds of services and treatments that Medicaid would cover that private insurance might not? Safeguards must be in place to ensure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of insurance companies or health care providers. A true choice for consumers is one where they are completelyinformed of their options. There's also, I suspect, an element of cynical calculation. As I said, rural voters often complain that national elites don't care about their needs. Well, one way to make people feel hostile toward those elites is to block their access to federal benefits, and hope they don't realize who's actually causing their misery. Idahoans who need the dependable and inclusive coverage should not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid. While marketplace plans offer cost-sharing assistance to low-income individuals, these individuals would still facesignificantly higher out-of-pocket costs than in Medicaid, making it more difficult to afford going to the doctor orfilling a prescription. In any case, the point is that while rural decline in general is a hard problem, with no easy answers, rescuing rural health care isn't hard at all. We know how to ensure that rural Americans get the health care they need. This isn't a problem of policy, it's a problem of politics. Please don't deny hard working Idahoans the health care coverage they need, especially targeting those who happen to be making better wages than the those even worse off Sincerely,ARCHIE GEORGE Wilson DOI Reform Letter for Modified Expansion for Boise\"s Public Hearing and Public Comment Record\u00ad Monday, June 24, 2019 5:05:03 PM TwilsonII-Letter 2019.pdf Thank you for taking the time to listen to my testimony today. Attached is my letter for Public Hearing & Public Comment Record. Teny J. Wilson II, Sociology, BS Criminal Justice, MA PhD candidate (School of Public Policy) Boise State University 1910 University Drive Boise ID 83725-1955 June 24th, 2019 To Whom It May Concern, My name is Terry J. Wilson II. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Sociology in May 2015 from Boise State University. I am set to take the Comprehensive Exam, graduating in the Fall of 2019, with a Master of Arts in the Criminal Justice Department at Boise State University. I then have made arrangements to apply to attend the School of Public Service for my PhD in Public Policy . I aspire, a career of professorship conducting racial and environmental justice re search. As a graduate student and researcher with stage IV lymphoma & excruciating bone - disintegrating lesion in my iliac crest or hip, although not on disability am unable to find traditional labor or conventional work. I want to take the time to acknowl edge oncologist Dr. Stephanie Hodson and radiologist Dr. Joseph Brooks; I wouldn't have made it before this committee if it weren't for them rallying for my treatment because I, among nearly 100K Idahoans fell in the Medicaid and Medicare health coverage g ap. I am forced to decide whether to pay for medicine or purchase food. I can personally describe the trauma and difficulties of navigating the bureaucracy of healthcare including attempting to apply for financial assistance(es) or to get support from Idah o's catastrophic care program or indigent service fund, this \"safety -net\" also failed me. I now am likely unable to purchase a home due to insurmountable medical costs of chemotherapy and radiation (upwards of $80K). I also want to thank Luke Mayfield and Sam Sandmire of Reclaim Idaho along with the many volunteers who've go unrecognized, it because of you I am present. I also want to thank the Committee Department of Health and Welfare for standing with Idahoans to protect the objective of Medicaid; to protect the needy. I especially want to thank U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C. who found that Medicaid work requirements for low -income people in Arkansas and Kentucky's proposed work requirements stating, \"arbitrary and capricious be cause [they] did not address ... whether and how sideboards, or expansions evasions, are even able implicate the 'core' objective of Medicaid: the provision of medical coverage to the needy.\" Idaho's leadership has failed to address what 61% of Idahoans voted to protect; the needs of its most vulnerable like the mentally -troubled, the poor working class, the indigent, along with a growing student population. The recent inaction of Idaho's legislature and current Governor speak to their inability to enact the wishes of the people of the great State of Idaho. Similarly, several other Republican -led states like Arkansas too continue an assault on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) issuing state-based plans resulting in massive coverage gaps that dispropor tionately effect students and the poorest working class, academics and/or student researchers like myself. Section 1332 is nothing more than a bait -and-switch for Idaho families. While a work requirement could potentially prevent academic stewardship(s) i t could quite possibly motivate Idaho's young -healthy adults to seek employment, but there is no research to support this logic that is mechanized by Idaho's current leadership in House Bill 277's (SB 1204), which assumes that somehow working can improve o ne's health condition. The same requirement could harm older adults or those with chronic conditions, for e.g. if they lose Medicaid coverage and become unable to afford effective medical care. Research suggest(s) to the contrary, \"it is under/unemployed o lder adults and people with serious health conditions also face greater challenges in gaining and maintaining employment...& the association between work and better health is due mainly to healthier adults being better able to find and maintain employment \u2014 rather than employment resulting in improved health \u2014 then the health harms associated with rescinding Medicaid coverage for nonworking adults will probably far out - weigh the uncertain health bene - fits for enrollees who gain jobs.\" (Ayanian et. al, 2018) . The intended effect, \"to encourage self-sufficiency and to incentivize the unemployed and under -employed individuals to engage in work and training opportunities to build financial stability.\" What is interesting is this argument is that our leaders are fiscally irresponsible themselves. We need leaders that rely on data and research; avoiding Medicaid expansion, not implementing (ACA) is resulting in an estimated 246 million in state dollars, 3.3 billion in federal dollars and another 1.5 billion in hosp ital reimbursements (Dorn, McGrath, & Holahan, 2014). According to a report from March 26th, 2019 from the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy (ICFP) more than unmodified expansion or \"sideboards\" proposed in HB 277 would cost Idaho 32.2 million dollars, but a lso prevents Medicaid coverage to 32,000 people with incomes between 101 -138 percent of Federal Poverty Level (FPL) or those making under 20 thousand dollars ($14 -$19K) jeopardiz ing the enhanced federal matching rate offered under unmodified implementation of Medicaid expansion. Modifying implementing Medicaid expansion also creates new administrative burdens and costs for physicians and enrollees, work requirements may oblige physicians to be involved in determining whether patients maintain or lose insura nce coverage. Physicians will probably play an important role in determining whether their patients are eligible for health -related exemptions from work requirements will likely lead to further racial and gender discrimination(s) , resulting in lawsuits. Modified expansion or \"sideboards\" are indeed \"sideswipes\" and HB277 SB 1204 essentially proclaims that my past, current , and future contributions do not matte r and that students like myself do not matter, but I am here to testify that we do matt er. There are people dying out there. Thank you for your time and consideration . Sincerely, Terry J. Wilson II TJW II Terry J.

I am new to Idaho but fully support the citizens' initiative passed by the majority last year. Upholding the Constitution against all enemiesforeign and domestic means that everyone, legislators included, is to listen to and honor the wishes of the majority of the citizens whom they have the privilege to represent. The actions of the Idaho legislature are shameful and in the worst interests of the future of our democratic republic. Build an opt out system from the approved, expanded medicaid. Keep all citizens, especially those affected directly, fully informed. Adhere to the full wishes and intent of the 61% majority who passed the medicaid expansion. Idaho legislators are representatives of their constituents, not above them. If you can't live by this fundamental aspect built by our founding fathers, then resign. It is past time you return to thinking about the common good, and taking action toward that common goal. Sincerely,Armando Costales 4125 W Everest Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 25, 2019 8:50:07 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, The way this is presented it seems that a person will have to decline private insurance before they get information about Medicaid. This will cause much confusion. This seems designed for the private insurers to get more tax credit funds for themselves, rather than giving information to the patient with side by side comparisons so they can make an informed decision. Plus this will be more expensive to tax payers! Why???

It will cost: *more money for the State of Idaho to implement (allocating resources and personnel to provide information andanswer questions for constituents),*more money for the Federal Government with additional insurance costs (on top of what is already allocated tofund Medicaid),*and it will cost the currently uninsured people of Idaho more money in co-pays, premiums, etc., if they purchasehealth insurance through the exchange with an Advanced Premium Tax Credit. Enrollment in Medicaid is the most efficient and cost effective way to provide health insurance to the currently uninsured people in Idaho who make 100-138% of the federal poverty level. Offering this \"choice\" through waiver 1332 sounds good, but it will cost people time, energy and resources that they may not have, in order to choose something that will cost them more money and instability of health care services in the long run. The people of Idaho voted to expand Medicaid to the currently uninsured Idaho citizens making up to 138% of the federal poverty level. They did not vote for the implementation of costly waivers that keep people from receiving health care in the most efficient and cost effective way possible under the current circumstances. All Idaho citizensshould have health care to provide stability to their lives and to help them reach their maximum potential as contributing members of their communities.

With best regards,Heather Heather E. KimmelDirector | Health Promotions | Western DivisionAmerican Lung Association1412 W. Idaho Street, Suite 100Boise, ID 83702 | f e~~~ICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ~ June 27, 2019 Dean L. Cameron Director Idaho Department of Insurance 700 West State Street, 3rd Floor P.O. Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0043 Re: Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver Application Dear Director Cameron: The American Lung Association in Idaho appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on Idaho's \"Coverage Choice Waiver Application. \" The American Lung Association is the oldest voluntary public health association in the United States, currently representing the 35 million Americans living with lung diseases including asthma, lung cancer and COPD, including more than 196,000 Idaho residents. The Lung Association is the leading organization working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through research, education and advocacy. The American Lung Association in Idaho believes everyone should have access to quality and affordable health coverage. Unfortunately, the Coverage Choice Waiver, which would allow individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level to choose to enroll in either Medicaid or private insurance through the Idaho State Exchange , will create additiona l confusion that results in lower income individuals and families enrolling in more expensive and potentially less\u00ad comprehensive coverage.To ensure all low-income patients with or at risk of lung disease have access to and enroll in quality and affordable healthcare , the American Lung Association opposes the Coverage Choice Waiver Application. Affordability Most low-income Idahoans have lacked quality and affordable healthcare due to the state's previous unwillingness to expand its Medicaid program to 138 percent of the federal poverty level or about $2,390 a month for a family of three. In November 2018, voters in Idaho approved full expansion of the Medicaid program, but the Idaho legislature acted in opposition to voters' will and approved additional restrictions on coverage including a work reporting requirement. The Coverage Choice Waiver, also resulting from this legislation , will not improve these families' access to quality and affordable healthcare. Private health insurance , even with Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs), is more expensive than Medicaid. By law, Medicaid cost-sharing cannot exceed more than five percent of an enrollee's income. Typically, Medicaid enrollees don't pay premiums and have minimal cost-sharing. Those enrolled in private insurance are required to pay premiums and are 1412 W Idaho Street, Suite 100 I Boise, ID 83702 l--11 www.lung.org/idaho Please remember the American Lung Association in your will and h'11st 1-800-LUNGUSA I LUNG.org t e~~~\u00b7CAN LUNG AssocATION \" subject to additional cost-sharing in the forms of co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles. Research shows that even limited cost-sharing can deter low-income individuals from accessing necessary healthcare services.i Additionally , when Oregon implemented a premium in its Medicaid program, with a maximum premium of $20 per month, almost half of enrollees lost coverage.i i The proposed waiver does not include the actuaria I analysis to demonstrate that coverage under this waiver would be as affordable as without it. Based on the information available and previous experiences with similar populations, it appears the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the statuary requireme nt that coverage under a 1332 waiver be as affordable as it would be absent the waiver. The Coverage Choice Waiver application does not provide specific information on how individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level will be informed about their healthcare choices. Will these individuals be presented the option to enroll in Medicaid when they start the open enrollment process, or will that option only exist if they decline private coverage through the exchange? If it is the later, that is not a true choice. To further ensure enrollees would have a choice between exchange and Medicaid coverage , any enrollment assistance must be neutral and not biased towards one option or the other. Additionally, if a Medicaid -eligible individual enrolled in private insurance wishes to enroll in Medicaid during the middle of a plan year, can they change their coverage? For lung disease patients, including those with asthma, COPD and lung cancer, any gap in coverage can be detrimental to their prognosis and health. It is imperative that there is a clear and simple way for individuals to enrollee in Medicaid if they become eligible during a time other than open enrollment. Adequacy While both Medicaid expansion plans and private insurance sold in the exchange are required to cover the ten essential health benefits, there are some additional services that Medicaid is required to cover, but private insurance is not. For example, Medicaid expansion plans provide non-emergency transportation services, a benefit private insurance does not provide. Additionally, Medicaid covers certain home health services and other services, including things like case management that private insurance is not required to cover. For patients with asthma, these services can help them manage their disease and live more productive lives. Again, to ensure that enrollees fully understand the differences in their coverage options, robust and unbiased enrollment assistance would be crucial. Budget Neutrality The proposed Coverage Choice Waiver claims to meet the budget neutrality guardrail for a 1332 waiver. Unfortunately, based on the information provided, this does not appear to be accurate. The waiver incorrectly calculates the budget neutrality by assuming Medicaid expansion does not exist and that individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in exchange coverage would otherwise be uninsured. This is incorrect , as they would be otherwise enrolled in Medicaid expansion. On top of that, it is more expensive for the federal government for individua ls between 100 and 138 percent FPL to enroll in exchange coverage than Medicaid expansion. A previous Idaho 1332 waiver analysis found that APTC and cost-sharing reductions for individuals between 100 and 138 percent of FPL would cost the federal government $7,700 per person. The same analysis found Medicaid expansion would cost the federal government $3,878 per person.iii The 1412 W Idaho Street, Suite 100 I Boise, ID 83702 ~ I www.lung.org/idaho Please remember the American Lung Association in your will and h,ust 1-800-LUNGUSA I LUNG.org f e~~~ICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION e proposed waiver application does not include the actuarial analysis needed to understand costs and coverage implications of this waiver. This information is needed as part of a complete application. Absent the official actuarial analysis, previous estimates imply the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the budget neutrality guardrail. The American Lung Association in Idaho believes that healthcare should be affordable, accessible, and adequate. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver compromises the affordabi lity of healthcare coverage for some of Idaho's most vulnerable residents. The Lung Association in Idaho opposes this waiver.

The only reason our legislators want to offer this choice is a cynical attempt to dissuade poor Idahoans from signing up for Medicaid and thereby increase state expenditures for Medicaid. Fear of Medicaid as payor because of hypothesized loss of choice of providers has been publicized by legislators who opposed Medicaid expansion. The reality is that the real loss of choice is when people do not go to the doctor because of large copays and deductibles charged by private plans.

Cameron Director Idaho Department of Insurance 700 West State Street, 3rd Floor P.O. Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0043 Re: NORD Opposition to Idaho's 1332 Waiver Application Dear Director Cameron: On behalf of the 1-in-10 Idaho residents with one of the over 7,000 known rare diseases, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on Idaho's Coverage Choice Waiver Application. NORD is a unique federation of voluntary health organizations dedicated to helping people with rare \"orphan\" diseases and assisting the organizations that serve them. Since 1983, we have been committed to the identification, treatment, and cure of rare disorders through programs of education, advocacy, research, and patient services. NORD believes everyone should have access to quality and affordable health coverage. Unfortunately, this waiver will create additional confusion resulting in lower income individuals and families enrolling in more expensive and potentially less-comprehensive coverage. To ensure all low-income rare disease patients have access to and enroll in quality and affordable health care, Idaho should oppose the Coverage Choice Waiver Application. Affordability Most low-income Idahoans have lacked quality and affordable health care due to the state's previous refusal to expand eligibility for its Medicaid program to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $2,390 a month for a family of three. In November 2018, voters in Idaho approved full expansion of the Medicaid program, but the Idaho legislature defied this decision and approved additional restrictions on coverage including a work reporting requirement. The Coverage Choice Waiver, also resulting from this legislation, will not improve these families' access to quality and affordable health care. The Coverage Choice Waiver would allow individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level to choose to enrollee in either Medicaid or private insurance through the Idaho State Exchange. However, private health insurance, even with Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs), is more expensive than Medicaid. By law, rareaction.org rareID.org Medicaid cost-sharing cannot exceed more than five percent of an enrollee's income. Typically, Medicaid enrollees don't pay premiums and have minimal cost-sharing. Those enrolled in private insurance are required to pay premiums and are subject to additional cost-sharing in the forms of co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles. Research shows that even limited cost-sharing can deter low-income individuals from accessing necessary health care services.i Additionally, when Oregon implemented a premium in its Medicaid program, with a maximum premium of $20 per month, almost half of enrollees lost coverage.ii The proposed waiver does not include the actuarial analysis to demonstrate coverage under this waiver would be as affordable as without it. Based on the information available and previous experiences with similar population, it appears the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the statuary requirement that coverage under a 1332 waiver be as affordable as it would be absent the waiver. Further, the Cover Choice Waiver application does not provide specific information on how individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level will be informed about their healthcare choices. Will these individuals be presented the option to enroll in Medicaid when they start the open enrollment process, or will that option only exist if they decline private coverage through the exchange? If it is the later, that is not a true choice. To further ensure enrollees would have a choice between exchange and Medicaid coverage, any enrollment assistance must be neutral and not biased towards one option or the other. Additionally, if a Medicaid-eligible individual enrolled in private insurance wishes to enroll in Medicaid during the middle of a plan year, can they change their coverage? For rare disease patients, any gap in coverage can be detrimental to their prognosis and health. It is imperative that there is a clear and simple way for individuals to enrollee in Medicaid if they become eligible during a time other than open enrollment. Adequacy While both Medicaid expansion plans and private insurance sold in the exchange are required to cover the ten essential health benefits, there are some additional services Medicaid is required to cover, but plans on the Idaho State Exchange are not. For example, Medicaid expansion plans provide non-emergency transportation services, a benefit private insurance does not provide. Additionally, Medicaid covers certain home health services and other services, including things like case management, that private insurance is not required to cover. Again, to ensure that enrollees fully understand the differences in their coverage options, robust and unbiased enrollment assistance would be crucial. Budget Neutrality The proposed Coverage Choice Waiver claims to meet the budget neutrality guardrail for a 1332 waiver. However, based on the information provided, this does not appear to be accurate. The waiver incorrectly calculates the budget neutrality assuming Medicaid expansion does not exist and the individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in exchange coverage would otherwise be uninsured. This is incorrect, as they would be otherwise rareaction .org rareID.org enrolled in Medicaid expansion. On top of that it is more expensive for the federal government for individuals between 100 and 138 percent FPL to enroll in exchange coverage than Medicaid expansion. A previous Idaho 1332 waiver analysis found that APTC and cost-sharing reductions for individuals between 100 and 138 percent of FPL would cost the f ederal government $7,700 per person. The same analysis found Medicaid expansion would cost the federal government $3,878 per person. iii The proposed waiver application does not include the actuarial analysis needed to understand costs and coverage implicatio ns of this waiver. This information is needed as part of a complete application. Absent the official actuarial analysis, previous estimates imply the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the budget neutrality guardrail. NORD believes health care should affordable, accessible, and adequate. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver compromises the affordability of health care coverage for some of Idaho's most vulnerable residents. NORD opposes this waiver.

Those private plans are less reliable, less comprehensive and more expensive than Medicaid Expansion.

Without thewaiver, they would automatically be enrolled in Medicaid. I was one of the many hundreds of Idahoans who worked to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot in Idaho and then again to get it passed. Voters approved the expansion by a large margin.

This is what the voters want, and this is what Idaho residents need. I urge you to deny this application for a waiver.

No one benefits from an ill workforce, or from people in declining health because it becomes more expensive to care for them later. Requiring poor people to jump through additional bureaucratic hoops is counterproductive. WHY PROPOSE A TAXPAYER-SUBSIDIZED PRIVATE INSURANCE EXCHANGE ? (DON'T DO IT!) Having observed how miserly Idaho's legislature has behaved over my 24+ years as a resident, I am wa1y of its offering poor people a \"choice\" that would require premiums and co-pays. From what I've read, that option would cost more money and provide fewer benefits. I ask the Depaiiment of Insurance to drop its request for a waiver from Medicare mles. I FOLLOW STATE AND NATIONAL POLITICS, AND I CAST MY BALLOTS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. The Idaho legislature has shown disdain for obeying the will of its citizens by substituting by placing restrictions on Medicaid expansion, and by (almost) making it even more difficult for citizens' initiatives to qualify for the ballot. I will carefully be watching the outcome of this process. If I cannot influence your choices, I will seek to influence my neighbors' and friends' choices in eve1y future election.

Box 83720 Boise, Idaho 83720-0043 Dear Director Cameron: On behalf of the more than 30 million Americans living with diabetes and the 84 million more with prediabetes , the American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides the following comments on the state's draft Section 1332 State Relief and Empowerment Waiver application , titled the Coverage Choice Waiver. As the global authority on diabetes, the ADA funds research to better understand, prevent and manage diabetes and its complications; publishes the world's two most respected scientific journals in the field, Diabetes and Diabetes Care; sets the standards for diabetes care; holds the world's most respected diabetes scientific and educationa l conferences; advocates to increase research funding, improve health care, enact public policies to stop diabetes, and end discrimination against those denied their rights because of the disease; and supports individua ls and communities by connecting them with the resources they need to prevent diabetes and better manage the disease and its devastating complications. The ADA appreciates the state's interest in expanding coverage and providing individuals with choice; however, we believe the Coverage Choice Waiver fails to meet the requirements of Section 1332 guidance and will result in low-income individuals paying more to access coverage and health care than they would under the Medicaid expansion approved by voters last year. Below are our specific comments on the application dated May 31, 2019, which we note does not include an actuarial analysis that would allow for a more thorough review of the state's estimates of the full, projected effects of the draft waiver, particular ly the cost to the federal government . Waiver must be considered relative to Medicaid Expansion The draft waiver application compares the costs to individua ls and the federal government to those in effect under the \"status quo.\" Under this comparison, the state points to potential savings to the federal government from those individuals now enrolled in a qualified health plan (QHP) moving to Medicaid under the expansion. However, the comparison should be to the Medicaid expansion that will take effect on January 1, 2020. 2451 Crystal Drive Suite 900 Arlington, VA 22202 1-800-DIABETES -diabetes.org @AmDiabetesAssn A American Diabetes \u00aeAssociation \u00ae Connected for Life -Federal law-which establishes the baseline to which waiver programs must be compared - assumes non-expans ion states may take up Medicaid expansion at any time. Beginning in January, Idahoans with income between 100 and 138 percent of poverty will be eligible for Medicaid, regardless of the waiver. Allowing individuals in that income range to elect coverage under a QHP will therefore increase federal spending, since advanceab le premium tax credits (APTCs) are funded by the federal government . Thus, the draft waiver application violates the requirement under Section 1332 guidance that a state waiver program must not increase the federal deficit. In addition, individuals eligible for Medicaid who instead obtain coverage under a QHP will pay more out-of-pocket for their coverage and health care. Although the waiver application talks about giving Idahoans choice, the assumption appears to be that individuals will remain or be enrolled in a QHP with APTCs unless they opt out. Even with the maximum APTC available to individuals in this income range, individua ls will be subject to higher premiums and out-of\u00ad pocket costs than under Medicaid, which by law cannot impose cost-shar ing that exceeds 5 percent of an enrollee's income. The coverage choice raises risks of steering. gaps in coverage Even if Medicaid individuals are given a true choice between a QHP and Medicaid , we are concerned that individua ls may end up in less-than-opt imal coverage. There is no assurance in the waiver application that affected individuals will receive neutral assistance in evaluating their coverage options. Providers that may assist with enrollment have incentives to steer individuals to QHPs instead of Medicaid, in order to maximize reimbursement rates for health care services. At the same time, the state has a financial incentive to shift costs for covered individuals from Medicaid to federally financed APTCs. For people with diabetes, enrolling in the wrong plan may mean essential services and treatments are not be available or affordable. Finally, it's unclear whether individuals found eligible for Medicaid outside the marketplace open enrollment period will be enrolled without a gap in coverage . Will individuals be enrolled in Medicaid with the option to switch to a QHP during open enrollment, or will they be subject to a waiting period until a QHP is available to them? Diabetes is a complex, chronic illness that requires continuous medical care1 and individuals with diabetes cannot afford a sudden gap in health insurance coverage. A recent study found that people with type 1 diabetes who experience a gap or interruption in coverage, are five times more likely to use acute care services (i.e. urgent care facilities or emergency departments) than those with continuous coverage.2 Uncertainty in coverage acts as a barrier and burden that impedes access to health services that Idaho residents with diabetes need. For these reasons, we urge the state to withdraw the waiver application and instead work to implement the Medicaid expansion with a robust outreach campaign to identify individua ls newly eligible for Medicaid .

Will the individuals have a clear understanding of what the choices they are making and the financial differences between the two? Will these individuals have tospecifically decline coverage under the private exchanges before being eligible for Medicaid? This waiver could also result in greater bureaucratic rules, regulations, appeals, etc. at a greater cost to taxpayers. Nearly 61 per cent of Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion.

Cameron Director Idaho Department of Insurance 700 West State Street, 3rd Floor P.O. Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0043 RE: Coverage Choice Waiver Application Dear Director Cameron, The Global Healthy Living Foundation (GHLF) writes in opposition to Idaho's Coverage Choice Waiver Application. GHLF believes that healthcare should be affordable and accessible and this waiver limits both affordability and accessibility. By way of background, GHLF is a 20-year-old non-profit patient organization reaching millions of chronically ill patients and their caregivers across the country through social media, community events and online support and education. GHLF works to improve the quality of life for patients living with chronic disease by making sure their voices are heard and advocating for improved access to care at the local level. Our patients suffer from chronic conditions including arthritis, psoriasis, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease and migraines. Our patients rely on affordable and accessible healthcare coverage to manage their complex conditions in order to function in everyday life. It is on behalf of our patients that we urge Idaho to oppose the Coverage Choice Waiver Application . In November 2018, Idaho voters approved a ballot initiative for a full expansion of Medicaid as allowed by the Affordable Care Act. However, the Idaho legislature subsequently imposed barriers on coverage, including a \"work requirement\" for enrollees. The Coverage Choice Waiver developed by the legislature would allow Idahoans with incomes from 100 percent to 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) the choice to enroll in Medicaid or enroll in private health insurance on the Idaho State Exchange. This would be accomplished through providing Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) to reduce premiums and cost-sharing reductions for private health insurance. GHLF believes that accessibility of necessary health care treatments, which includes making the language accessible and comprehendible by patients, is paramount to achieving reduced health care spending and better health outcomes. As currently proposed, the Coverage Choice Waiver lacks clear explanations and protocols to provide the specific information that patients need to make informed decisions about their health care plans. It is also unclear that the choices will be put out in a clear, straightforward, and unbiased manner . The waiver seeks to preserve choice, 2 but instead it adds a layer of complication. While we encourage the expansion of coverage options available to patients, this waiver limits autonomy by requiring a level of health literacy that many patients lack. Medicaid is significantly more affordable compared with private insurance, as Medicaid enrollees generally do not pay premiums and are faced with low cost-sharing. Even with the tax credits and cost sharing reductions, affordability remains an encumbrance for private insurance enrollees. Our patients with chronic conditions face high healthcare costs and should not be discouraged from seeking care as a result of affordability issues. It is not evident that coverage under the Coverage Choice Waiver would match Medicaid's levels of affordability, especially for chronically ill patients who have constant encounters with healthcare. In terms of adequacy, the Choice Waiver private insurance option does not provide the scope of coverage that Medicaid is required to cover. Under Medicaid expansion services such as home health care, medical transportation, and case management are covered. 1 This type of coverage is not required under private insurance plans. These services are especially important in the chronic disease population that GHLF represents as they focus on coordinated care. Idahoans must be made aware of these discrepancies in coverage a clear manner when making enrollment choices. Section 1332 requires that the coverage be at least as comprehensive and affordable as would be provided absent the waiver. Due to the expenses resulting from premiums and cost sharing and lack of wide-ranging services, the Coverage Choice Waiver does not fulfill these conditions. Section 1332 requires that waivers be deficit neutral, however the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet this requirement. The budget for the waiver is calculated assuming no Medicaid expansion; therefore, assuming those individuals between 100 percent and 138 percent of FPL would be uninsured. However, these individuals would be enrolled in Medicaid, once expansion is taken into effect in 2020, therefore reducing this coverage gap . The Coverage Choice Waiver would increase federal spending as it costs more to provide the tax credits than to provide Medicaid coverage. With the waiver, the individual market is expected to increase by 24,000 to 26,000 enrollees. Estimates indicate that the cost of Medicaid expansion for individuals between 100 percent and 138 percent of FPL is $3,822 less per person compared to the cost of providing APTC and cost-sharing reductions. 2 Given this information, the Coverage Choice Waiver is not expected to be budget neutral. GHLF opposes the Coverage Choice Waiver as it complicates the affordability, accessibility and scope of coverage for Idahoans. We respectfully ask that you oppose this waiver to ensure that our patients are able to receive the comprehensive coverage they need at an affordable rate. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Email: DOl.Refo rm@doi.idaho.gov Re: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Thank you for giving the public a chance to make comment on the proposed 1332 waiver. The intention of the voters of the state of Idaho in November 2018 when they pa.ssed Proposition 2, was to extend Medicaid coverage to Idahoans in the 100-138% of the poverty level. The application for a 1332 waiver to now provide private insurance choice is a step backwards away from f uU Medicaid coverage, and will likely lead to more people not being insured. In 2017, the Latah Board of County Commission ers spoke in favor of the s_tate of Idaho applying for two waivers (including a 1332 waiver). Absent of Medicaid expansion, we saw that application as a limited step in the right direction toward closing the insurance gap. Now that Medicaid Expansion in the law in Idaho, we find ourselves opposed to the 1332 waiver being granted in Idaho, as it will be a move away from complete closure of the insurance gap. As this Board of Latah County Commissioners addresses the best way to serve the roughly l,500 Latah County residents finding themselves in the insurance gap, we draw the following conclusions about this waiver: Medicaid provides more compreh ensive coverage than private insurance. Medicaid offers more affordability and stability than plans on the exchange. [dahoans need a transparent anu unbiased enrollment process and to have a dear pathway to Medicaid coverage. We urge your department, and the olher departments of the State of Idaho, to fully implement Medicaid Expansion without unnecessary distractions.

This includes: 1. Itemizing out-of-pocket costs, premiums, and co-pays. 2. Comparing benefits and services of private plans against Medicaid's coverage, including mental illness care. Again this must be provided in an easily accessible manner. 3. Not requiring declining exchange coverage in order to obtain information on Medicaid. 4. Fully explaining to Idahoans what happens if they fail to pay premiums. 5. Allowing the consumers to be fully aware of their options. I have gone through the purchase of private insurance for a family member. There is often misleading informationprovided, or caveats that are not fully explained. This is unfair to the consumer and MUST BE AVOIDED underthis waiver request. Sincerely,Thomas Weingartner Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 4:20:09 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness nearly a quarter of Idahoans are living with a mental illness. Nearly 6 percent of those people are living with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Inaddition, Idaho has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. On average, Idaho's suicide rate is 48 percenthigher than the national rate. ( https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/topic/crisis-understanding-idahos-fragmented- mental-health-system#stream/0 ) If I'm understanding it correctly, the 1332 waiver tells an Idahoan who works but whose wages are at poverty levelor just above that they can go on Medicaid ... or they can go on the Idaho exchange and pay a premium, maybesmall, and have a deductible, maybe a small deductible, and then need to reapply next year without any assurancesthat their plan will still exist the next year. Will anyone from the Idaho Department of Insurance guide them throughtheir choice? Will that person be educated to handle the needs of the diagnosed and undiagnosed mentally ill? We have a daughter with diagnosed mental illness. She's a wonderful, intelligent, sweet person, a single mom who works her day job plus at least one more and donates plasma to make ends meet. That is if she's not in illness crisis.Right now she has employer group insurance. Her goal is to not lose that, her illness makes that goal unpredictable. When she's in a panic attack, or dealing with self harm urges, she needs medical help, not to have to deal with the process of premiums and deductibles and uncertainty, all on her own. She doesn't need Idaho legislator's red tape. Statistically, we all have someone we love with mental illness. What do we want for them? We may be stuck with this waiver for now. Please make it doable for our Idahoans in crisis. Please, don't be part of the second gap ourlegislators gave Idahoans with mental illness. Additional information: Only 47.5% of adults with mental illness in Idaho receive any form of treatment from either the public system or private providers (according to SAMHSA). The remaining 52.1% receive no mental health treatment. According to Mental Health America, Idaho is ranked 48 out of the 50 states and Washington D.C. for providing access to mental health services.

When asked to decline coverage under Idaho's exchange, will they be given a comprehensive and fair comparison of Medicaid vs. some type of marketplace coverage? Will they be warned that if they elect coverage other than Medicaid, they will have to pay regular premiums and probably co-pays and/or deductibles, and that failure to pay the these will likely result in lapse or loss of coverage? Will they be told that the private insurance costs will be higher than those for Medicaid? The waiver should be granted only if the state is required to give an unbiased, thorough and understandable comparison of the state exchange coverage and Medicaid. Sincerely,Betsy Dunklin 1519 E Holly StBoise, ID 83712 From: To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 11:30:07 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage than private insurance Medicaid offers better services and benefits to Idahoans with mental illness than private insurance; many people could risk losing out on more comprehensive coverage that they are eligible for because they were steered into a private plan instead. If this waiver is approved, a process must be in place to ensure Idahoans are informed about the benefits package they will receive and the out of pocket costs, such as premiums and copays, they may incur depending on whatchoice they make. Idahoans should not have to choose to decline exchange coverage in order to learn more about Medicaid eligibility.While marketplace plans offer cost-sharing assistance to low-income individuals, these individuals would still facesignificantly higher out-of-pocket costs than in Medicaid, making it more difficult to afford going to the doctor orfilling a prescription.Research shows that even relatively small levels of cost-sharing on Medicaid beneficiaries, ranging from $1 to $5,are associated with reduced use of care.Nearly 10,000 Idahoans today are eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange but don't, most likely due to the costof health insurance. Please do your jobs and keep the health plans that voters requested through our votes. Thank 1332 Waiver Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 10:39:16 AM Dear Product Review Bureau Chief: As a concerned Idahoan, I want to share some thoughts about implementation of this waiver, and how the population Medicaid is intended to benefit is best informed about theseimportant, often life-altering decisions. As a consumer of individual health insurance in Idaho for nearly 20 years, I have been at the mercy of the insurance industry and seen my rates grow exponentially over the years. The state exchange was a tremendous help to me personally, but for many low-incomefamilies struggling to make ends meet (and pay their rent or mortgage), Medicaid could atlong last provide them with the health care they have been lacking. Here are a few points to consider: Medicaid offers better services and benefits to Idahoans with mental illness than private insurance; many people could risk losing out on morecomprehensive coverage that they are eligible for because they were steered into a privateplan instead. If this waiver is approved, a process must be in place to ensure Idahoans are informed about the benefits they will receive and the out of pocket costs, such as premiums andcopays, they may incur depending on what choice they make. Even with cost sharing and premium assistance, exchange coverage requires payment of a monthly premium and deductibles. These financial obligations must be clearly explained tothis portion of the Medicaid eligible population in Idaho. Finally, safeguards must be in place to ensure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of insurance companies or health care providers. A true choice for consumers isone where they are completely informed of their options. Thank you for listening.Kathy Haley 4120 Shamrock St. Boise ID 83713From: Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Wednesday, June 19, 2019 9:20:11 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, While Idaho has chose to enlist in the state option to Medicaid Expansion, Waiver 1332 can be misleading in that staying with medical insurance from the exchange for those who have such insurance but fall below the 138% of poverty income are choosing the possibility of poorer coverage due to co-pays. To avoid poor choices it is essential that the impact of the choice between Medicaid Expansion and insurance from the exchange be clearly explained. Sincerely,Robert Gehrke 2279 Jacqueline LnPocatello, ID 83201 From: Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 1:00:15 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am writing to express my concerns about the 1332 \"waiver\" being sought by the State of Idaho, which would keep thousands of Idahoans who qualify for Medicaid Expansion saddled with expensive and less stable health care plans. 1) I am concerned that Idahoans will not have enough information to make an informed decision about whether or not they should switch. This waiver is presented as choice. How does the state propose to educate Idahoans about their choices? Will the state invest in advertising, literature, and staff who will distribute and explain the pros and cons of an exchange plan and how it differs from Medicaid Expansion? Will the true benefits of Medicaid Expansion be explained thoroughly and transparently? I want to know the details about how this waiver will roll out, and the investment the state will make to assure us that the rollout will reach the people who need to understand their options. If there is no plan, or the plan is inadequate, I request that you deny the waiver. 2) Will Idahoans who opt to stay on their exchange plan, but then find themselves unable to meet their high premiums, deductibles, and copays be allowed to switch to Medicaid Expansion? If no, then I request that you deny this waiver. Respectfully,Sincerely,Kathryn Hays 11545 W Florida DrBoise, ID 83709 From: Linda Lester To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Saturday, June 15, 2019 6:20:08 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Consumers must be given accurate and reliable information to assist them in making choices. Consumers should be able to compare coverage between private exchange plans and Medicaid. If consumers aren't well educated aboutthe differences between Medicaid and one of the private exchange insurance choices, they may wind up withcoverage they can't afford. Make this a transparent process., not the be that favors the private exchange coverage.

I have great concerns about the method and requirements concerning the Medicaid law recently passed. I know of many families that parents work under the table or off the books simply to qualify for this and other benefits. Some are highly successful and have a higher standard of living than those that follow the rules. The abuse of these free programs is wide spread. Many others have drug problems and expenses that our tax dollars simply support allowing them to live without drug treatment.

The process must be streamlined, and clearly explained, in the simplest of terms, to ensure they are able to meet whatever qualification criteria is established. They should not have to tick a box on some form somewhere that declines private insurance. If they are eligible, they are eligible. I want to know exactly what safeguards there are to prevent insurance companies from steering or guiding my fellow Idahoans into that are inferior to other options available for them.

Comprehensive coverage for all reduces costs for all by increasing the size of the coverage pool. Coverage should not be based on the whims of employers. Unemployed orunderemployed citizens need access to comprehensive health coverage which should include mental health carebecause underemployment contributes to depression and to drug use.Coverage should be easy to understand. All costs should be simple to predict. All health care providers and healthcare facilities should be required to disclose all costs. Those costs should be covered by the insurance. All drugs orprocedures should be covered. Numerous non-doctor procedures such as physical therapy, therapeutic massage,acupuncture and all other non allopathic procedures should be covered. Preventive procedures should be covered.This can be paid for by having a tax base that includes all incomes at all levels.

The waivers are expected to be 1 A \"tribal organization\" is recognized under the Indian Self-Determination body of any Indian tribe; any legally established organization of Indians which is controlled, sanct ioned, or chartered by such govern ing body or which is democratically elected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by such organization and which includes the maximum participation of Indians in all phases of its acti vities.\" NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HEALTH BOARD Burns -Paiute Tribe Chehalis Tribe Coeur d'Alene Tribe Colville Tribe Coos, Siuslaw, & Lower Umpqua Tribe Coquille Tribe Cow Creek Cowlitz Tribe Grand Tribe Tribe Jamestown Muckleshoot Tribe Nez Perce Tribe Nisqually Tribe Nooksack Tribe NW Band of Shoshoni Tr ibe Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe Puyallup Tribe Quileute Quinault Tribe Tribe Tribe Island Stillaguamish Tribe Suquamish Tribe Swinomish Tribe Tulalip Tribe Umatilla Tribe Skagit Tribe Warm Springs Tribe Yakama Nation 2121 S.W. (503) www.npaihb.org May 10 , 2019 Page 2 submitted as soon as July 26, 2019 with implementation on Janua ry 1, 2020. NPAIHB believes that there is a significant impact on American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal health programs related to the 1115 and 1332 waivers. I. Government -to-Government Treaty and Trust Responsibility The United States (U.S.) has a unique legal and political relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribal governments established through and confirmed by the U.S. Constitution, treaties, federal statutes, executive order s, and judicial decisions. Central to this relationship is the federal government's trust responsibility to protect the interests of Indian Tribes and communities, including the provision of healthcare to AI/ANs. This responsibility includes ensuring acces s to federal health programs like Medicaid. Congress has passed numerous Indian - specific laws to provide for Indian healthcare, including establishing the Indian health care system and permanently enacting the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA).2 Congress also enacted the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) of 1975 to enable tribes and tribal organizations to directly operate health programs that would otherwise be operated by the IHS, thereby empowering tribes to design and operate health programs that are responsive to community needs. Congress has declared that \"it is the policy of this Nation, in fulfillment of its special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to Indians ... to ensure the highest possible heal th status for Indians and urban Indians and to provide all resources necessary to effect that policy.\"3 This authorization allowed tribes to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services and since then, Medicaid is a critically important component of the Indian health funding stream, and allows many IHS and tribal health programs to begin to address some of the chronic health disparities faced by Indian people in the U. S. Without meaningful access to Medicaid resources, many IHS and tribal health programs woul d be unable to maintain current levels of service . NPAIHB and IHS/tribal health progra ms expect the IDHW and IDOI to uphold the statutory and regulatory Indian protections and provisions to ensure that AI/AN beneficiaries have access to needed services in both Your Health Idaho Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and Medicaid . The health and wellbeing of our people is one of the highest priorities for the tribes. In making these comments, we remind you that AI/ANs are among the nation's most vulnerable populati ons and that Medicaid plays a critically important role in extending valuable resources to the chronically underfunded Indian health system. The IDHW and IDOI must take into account the trust and treaty based responsibility into consideration when developi ng these waivers and not dictate to tribes what the state sees as fitting for our people. II. Tribal Consultation NPAIHB has not been provided with proposed waiver language for the three waivers. This language must be provided before meaningful consultation can take place with tribes. Meaningful consultation must take place throughout all stages of the process when developing any new policy to comprehensively understand and include our recommendations into the proposed waivers and develop strategic implementation plans to be inclusive of the needs of our patients and providers. 2 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 3 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(a)(1) Page 3 NPAIHB urges the IDHW and IDOI to provide prop osed language for the three waivers so that proper and meaningful consultation can take place. Once the S tate provides the proposed language for the waiver, NPAIHB requests that IDHW and IDOI provide 45 -day notice of tribal consultation from the date tha t proposed language for each proposed waiver is provided to tribes. This extension is necessary in order to engage in meaningful tribal consultation on the waivers and prior to submission of the proposed waivers to CMS. There has not been adequate informa tion and time provided to tribes to evaluate the implications on IHS and t ribal providers and patients. Additionally, NPAIHB request s that IDOI and Your Health Idaho Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) be more engaged with tribes throughout the development of wa ivers, submission and implementation process. III. Medicaid Expansion Tribal Impacts In November 2018, Idahoans voted, via a referendum, to expand Medicaid in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which allows Medicaid eligibility to individuals with income up to 138% FPL who were not previously eligible for Medicaid under previously established eligibility categories (age, disability, parental status, etc.). The Idaho legislature authorized and modified Medicai d expansion with their own additional requirements in Senate Bill 12044, instructing the IDHW and IDOI to seek a waiver from the federal government to permit individuals and families who have an adjusted gross income at or above 100% FPL to receive the Adv anced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) to purchase a coverage plan through the Idaho health insurance exchange, notwithstanding the implementation of Medicaid expansion. Any individual who is eligible for Medicaid may still choose to enroll in Medicaid instead of receiving the APTC to purchase a qualified health plan. Medicaid expansion allows IHS and tribal health facilities to better serve their AI/AN patient populations. The approval of Medicaid expansion will assist in reducing the persistent disparities in healthcare and medical services for AI /ANs. Many of our patients rely upon direct care provided by IHS, and the high uninsured rate is a significant barrier to obtaining healthcare for both physical and behavioral needs. For example, AI/AN patients often resort to \"seasonal sickness\" based on the fiscal year, knowing if referrals are necessary to wait until October when funding is available for non -emergency referrals. Medicaid and its recent expansion provide critical access to a broader array of services and providers. Since the federal government covers 100% of costs for services (federal medical assistance percentage or FMAP) provided to AI /AN Medicaid enrollees through an IHS or tribally -operated facility, there would be no cost to the state. This alleviates 100% of Idaho's responsibility to allocate state general funds to meet the cost of care provided at IHS or tribal health facilities. In 2016, CMS released guidance that expands the scope of services considered \"received through\" an IHS/ tribal facility that may qualify for 100% FMAP .5 Expanding the scope of services that can qualify for 100% FMAP provides potential increased savings to states and incentives to increase access to care for AI /ANs and expand capacity of IHS and tribal health facilities. State should work with tribes on implementation of the expanded 100% FMAP to maximize savings with the goal of improving the health and services available to AI/AN Medicaid beneficiaries in Idaho. 4 Legislature of the state of Idaho.

Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver - Coverage Choice Waiver A. Purpose The ACA expanded affordability of health coverage in the individual health insurance market. Individuals and families with income between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) who were not otherwise eligible for Medi caid or affordable employer -sponsored health insurance have been able to qualify for help paying their health insurance via APTC. In addition, AI/ANs with incomes between 100% and 300% FPL will be eligible for zero cost sharing plans and with incomes below 100% FPL or above 300% FPL for limited cost sharing plans. There are also several other benefits and protections for AI/AN under the ACA and IHCIA. The State of Idaho, through the IDOI and in conjunction with Idaho's state -run health insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, is submitting the Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver (Section 1332 Waiver) request to the CMS and the U.S. Department of Treasury. The Section 1332 waiver allows the Medicaid expansion group with household incomes over 100% FPL to cho ose coverage with eligibility for an APTC through Your Health Idaho instead of enrolling in Medicaid or declining the tax credit and choosing to enroll in Medicaid coverage. According to IDOI, the goals of the proposed Section 1332 Waiver, also known as th e Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver are to: (1) empower individuals to choose to participate in commercial health insurance coverage over public insurance options, and (2) provide affordable coverage options to working Idahoans with household incomes above 100% of the FPL who are U.S. citizens regardless of Medicaid eligibility. According to May 13 Tribal Notice, the Coverage Choice Waiver has an \"anticipated impact to Tribal members and Tribal healthcare systems and how they assist Tribal members with their healthcare needs.\" NPAIHB is concerned as to why the state is determined to provide more of a focus for individuals between 100% and 138% FPL in the Marketplace, Your Health Idaho, in comparison to Medicaid. We believe the anticipated impact to AI/AN patien ts, IHS/tribal providers, and tribes is inadequate. NPAIHB requests that IDOI and IDHW develop and provide to tribes, providers, and AI/AN s a comparison of eligibility and benefits for Medicaid and Your Health Idaho QHPs. We request IDOI and IDHW partner with tribes to develop coverage materials for IHS beneficiaries to ensure transparent enrollment understanding and a clear pathway to Medicaid coverage for each patient. B. Eligibility and Enrollment Failure to address the coverage gap impacts everyone. Research has shown that even relatively small levels of cost -sharing on Medicaid beneficiaries, ranging from $1 to $5 are associated with reduced use of care, including necessary services. Insurance com panies disregard the AI/AN zero and limited cost sharing reductions and do not honor the Indian -provision requirements for Marketplaces required by federal law. NPAIHB urges IDHW and IDOI to include the federal Indian -specific provisions and protections in the body of the waiver or through Standard Terms and Conditions . Individuals up to 138% FPL will be eligible for Medicaid and NPAIHB urges IDHW and IDOI to work with tribes to ensure that Medicaid eligibility is made clear up front. Eligible individuals should not have to choose to decline Your Health Idaho coverage in order to learn May 10 , 2019 Page 5 more about Medicaid eligibility because it will be a biased enrollment process , safeguards must be put in place to prevent this . If AI/AN patients select the Your Health Idah o plan and the patient chooses to receive services from an IHS or tribal health facility that is out of network then the clinic will be paid at a lower rate or will not g et paid from the QHP . Therefore, it is a barrier and financial burden on the tribe and IHS/t ribal clinic. We request transparency up front during enrollment for whether the IHS/tribal clinic is part of the network and the disadvantages for the patient if the clinic is not in network. NPAIHB requests that IDHW and Your Health Idaho clearly highlight all of the IHS/t ribal clinics in Idaho within the provider lists for our patients to easily select our clinic as a provider. Currently, Your Health Idaho QHPs require different AI/AN verification for eligibility compared to IDHW M edicaid. Tribal enrollment verification through submission of a tribal identification card, t ribal enrollment number or certificate of Indian blood is an unnecessary barrier to care for our people . NPAIHB requests IDHW and IDOI to only require self-attesta tion for AI/AN verification for Your Health Idaho and Medicaid. IHS eligibility should be up to the tribe and IHS/t ribal clinic, and no additional verifications should be necessary. NPAIHB urges IDHW and IDOI to ensure that when AI/AN s complete a paper application that the information in the paper application is clearly transferred electronically into the state's system particularly with AI/AN or IHS beneficiary status . Some AI/AN have not had this information captured in the electronic system when it was clearly indicated in the paper application. NPAIHB also proposes the need for IDHW and IDOI to streamline and simplify the application process for IHS eligible beneficiaries. C. Choice of Your Health Idaho Concerns IHS beneficiaries who choose Your Health Idaho coverage will pay more for their insurance compared to Medicaid. The choice does not benefit Tribal members or the Tribal clinic to choose coverage through Your Health Idaho that costs more and covers less. The choices are confusing and the plans on Your Health Idaho appear to cover less than Medicaid. It will not be clear to our patients that Medicaid is clearly a better option than Your Health Idaho. Patients who choose the Your Health Idaho would still face significantly higher out -of-pocket costs than in Medicaid, making it more difficult to afford going to the doctor or filling a prescription. Another barrier is that IHS beneficiary patients will have to file taxes for the APTCs to participate in Your Health Idaho . NPAIH B requests that IDHW and IDOI clearly explain the considerations with enrollment in Your Heath Idaho. V. 1115 Demonstration Waiver s A. Purpose Section 1115 demonstrations can have a significant impact on beneficiaries, providers, states, tribes and local governments. They can also influence policy -making at the tribal, state, and federal level by introducing new approaches that can be models for other states and lead to programmatic changes nationwide. The purpose of Idaho's 1115 waivers are: to require the adult Medicaid expansion coverage group to participate in work, volunteering, job training; and to require all Medicaid participants served through Medicaid's Healthy Connections primary care program to obtain a referral for family planning s ervices or supplies before receiving them from a provider May 10 , 2019 Page 6 other than their chosen primary care provider (or an assigned primary care provider if they decline to choose one). B. Tribal Consultation on 1115 Waivers This 1115 waiver will impact tribal memb ers' benefits, eligibility and finances so there is a significant impact. In accordance with section 1902(a)(73)(A) of the Social Security Act, in the case of any state in which one or more IHS, Tribal or urban Indian programs furnishes heath care services , state must provide for a process under which the state seeks advice on a regular, ongoing basis from designees of such IHS, Tribal or urban Indian programs on matters relating to the application prior to the submission of any Medicaid State Plan Amendmen t (SPA), waiver requests, and proposals for demonstration projects that are likely to have a direct effect on Indians or IHS, tribal or urban Indian programs .6 To foster greater notice and a meaningful opportunity for input, in 2000, the Administration issued Executive Order 13175 regarding ''Consultation and Coordination with Indian and Tribal governments.''7 This Executive Order applies to the programs operated by the Federal government and, since States administer Medicaid and CHIP, CMS has issued guid ance to states to conduct consultation with tribes prior to implementing 1115 demonstration or 1915 waiver requests. In July 2001, CMS issued a letter to State Medicaid Directors (SMDL #01 - 024)8 that provided direction to States to allow federally -recogni zed Tribes to participate in the planning and development of Medicaid and CHIP demonstration applications and extensions through a consultation process. The guidance encouraged States to provide information to Tribal governments at least 60 days prior to implementation and to provide 30 days for Tribes to comment on a state's planned demonstration request. The letter also articulated principles of consultation, such as respect for the sovereign rights of Tribes. CMS established consultation procedures that allow States to meet simultaneously both the statutory requirements pertaining to IHS, Tribal or urban Indian programs , as well as the new statutory requirements that pertain to the public at large under the ACA . The ACA required the Secretary to set forth transparency and public notice procedures for experimental, pilot, and demonstration projects approved under section 1115 of the Social Security Act (SSA) in order to increase the degree to which information about Medicaid and CHIP demonstration applications and approved demonstration projects is publicly available, as well as to promote public input as States develop an d the federal government reviews these demonstrations.9 The Tribal consultation process is set forth at 42 CFR 431.408(b). On August 1, 2010, I DHW acknowledged through a Tribal consultation policy the unique relationship and recognition of the right of Indian Tribes to self -determination and self - government. This special relationship constitutes a government -to-government relationship between American Indian Tribes and Federal and State governments. To determine direct effect s on AI/AN s or Tribal health programs, State must answer questions to determine the direct effect on \"Native Americans or tribal programs\" when a waiver proposal is being considered. In looking at these questions, we would propose these answers: 6 Social Security Act Title 19 7 EO 13175 Title 3 8 SMDL #01 -024 9 CMS Transparency Information Bulletin May 10 , 2019 Page 7 1. Does the proposal or change directl y affect Native Americans or tribal programs but is federally or statutorily mandated? YES 2. Does the proposal or change impact services or access to services provided, or contracted for, by Tribes or Indian Health Services (IHS) including but not limited t o: a. Decrease/increase in services. YES b. Change in provider qualifications/requirements. NO c. Change service eligibility requirements (i.e. prior authorization). YES d. Place compliance costs on IHS and tribal health programs. YES e. Change in reimbursement rate or methodology. NO 3. Does the proposal negatively impact or change the eligibility for, or access to, Tribal members' Medicaid? YES Clearly, based on these proposed answers, there is a direct effect on \"Native Americans or tribal programs\" and Tribal consulta tion is required. We reiterate the request for tribal consultation on both 1115 waivers 45 -days after the proposed language for each waiver is provided to tribes for review. VI. 1115 D emonstration Waiver -Coverage Choice, Community Engagement, and Primary Care Family Planning A. Eligibility 1. Income over 100% Federal Poverty Level The May 13 Tribal Notice (p. 2, Section 2(a)) states that the purpose of this waiver is to limit coverage for expansion group members with incomes over 100% of federal poverty level (FPL) to exchange coverage or Medicaid, but not both. Per State's impact assessment on Tribal memb ers, \"Tribal members in the adult Medicaid expansion group who qualify and select exchange coverage will not have access to Medicaid coverage in addition to exchange coverage.\" For clarification, Medicaid coverage is available to not just Tribal members bu t to all AI/AN eligible for IHS, tribal and urban Indian health program services. IDHW must ensure that this broader definition is used for enrollment of newly eligible AI/AN. Medicaid coverage is significantly more beneficial for AI/ANs than QHPs in Your Health Idaho. Medicaid has no premiums or cost sharing and is clearly a better option for AI/ANs. For this reason, it is imperative that outreach and education materials clearly explain the difference between Medicaid and QHPs through Your Health Idaho. I t would also be critical to include a specific example with cost differences between the two types of coverage. We request that IDHW also include tribes in the development of all outreach and education materials for AI/AN to ensure the materials are accu rately capturing key points related to special benefits for AI/AN enrolled in Medicaid. In addition, we request that IDHW enrollment assisters be educated on the differences between Medicaid and QHPs to ensure that assisters are providing clear and accura te information to AI/ANs who are newly eligible for Medicaid. Thus, we request to be involved in reviewing outreach and education materials (i.e, scripts, Q&As, etc.) to enrollment May 10 , 2019 Page 8 assisters as to AI/ANs to ensure that the materials provide full and accu rate information specific to AI/AN. 2. Work, Volunteering, Job Training, or Education The May 13 Tribal Notce states (p. 2, Section 2(b)) that this 1115 waiver will require the adult Medicaid expansion coverage group to participate in work, volunteeri ng, job training, or education as a condition of their eligibility. Per State's impact assessment on tribal members, \"Tribal members will be exempt from this requirement and there is no impact anticipated. Tribal health programs who serve non -tribal membe rs may be impacted because some of the population they serve may be ineligible for Medicaid benefits because of these requirements.\" According to the Idaho S enate Bill 1204, an AI/AN who is eligible for services through the IHS or through a Tribal health program pursuant to the Indian Self -determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) is eligible for an exemption from the work, volunteering, job training or education Medicaid eligibility requirements . Since the exemption is broader than Tribal members, we remind the State to use the broader definition for the exemption to include all AI/AN eligible for the exemption. We also do not expect that AI/AN will be required to provide tribal enrollment inform ation to enroll in Medicaid. Self -attestation should be sufficient for determination of IHS/tribal services eligibility. As to non -Indian individuals who receive services at an IHS or Tribal facility, benefits coordinators are concerned about having an additional burden of monitoring these additional eligibility requirements. This request puts more stress on the benefits coordinators and will be more time consuming. We request that IDHW work with tribes to ensure a streamlined and simplified process for capturing work, volunteering, job training or education of non -Indians eligible for Medicaid. B. Referral for Family Planning Services or Supplies The Tribal Notice further states (p. 2, Section 2(c)) that this 1115 waiver will require all Medicaid pa rticipants served through Medicaid's Healthy Connections primary care program to obtain a referral for family planning services or supplies before receiving them from a provider other than their chosen primary care provider. Per the State's impact assessme nt on Tribal members, \"Tribal members will need to work with their primary care provider to obtain a referral rather than accessing services directly without a referral today. This may increase the work that needs to be done by Tribal primary care providers serving Tribal members or others eligible for Medicaid. Tribes have not seen the 1115 waiver language to properly and comprehensively address this referral requirement. Per the brief language provided by the state, the refer ral requirement appears to only apply to those individuals enrolled in Medicaid's Healthy Connection primary care program, a managed care program. The State is reminded that out -of-network IHS and Tribal facilities may refer AI/AN Medicaid beneficiaries to an in network provider pursuant to the managed care rules at \u00a7\u00a7 438.14(b)(6) and 457.1209. This provision is intended to avoid duplicate visits to a network provider to obtain a referral and any delay in treatment when referrals are made under these circu mstances. May 10 , 2019 Page 9 Importantly, most AI/ANs are enrolled in Medicaid fee for service and receive services from IHS or a Tribal facility. AI/ANs receiving services at an IHS or Tribal facility, and not enrolled in Medicaid's Healthy Connection primary care program, would not be required to obtain such a referral even if the AI/AN patient is referred out to another provider for the services. We generally disagree with the requi rement that individuals enrolled in Medicaid's Healthy Connection primary care program be required to obtain a referral for family planning services and supplies. Family planning services and supplies should be made available to all Medicaid beneficiaries from any Medicaid provider without a referral from their primary care provider. This requirement is especially burdensome on women and is a barrier to care and access to services. Women should be able to choose from a list of Medicaid providers that provid e these services and access these services through any of these providers. Some women may decide not to seek these services if they have to obtain a referral. We request that this referral requirement be eliminated. In addition, IDHW needs to improve how AI/AN s can find IHS and Tribal facilities. While many AI/ANs are receiving services at an IHS or tribal facility, there may be other AI/ANs in the State looking for IHS and tribal facility Medicaid providers. For Medicaid (livebetteridaho), there needs t o be a list of IHS and tribal facilities easily available on the website. In addition, the current system does not allow patients to search statewide for an IHS or tribal facility. We also note that Kootenai and Shoshone Bannock clinics do not come up on the state's website. C. Indian Special Terms and Conditions Special Terms and Conditions (STCs) are articulated in 1115 demonstration approval documents to reflect the policy agreements between states and CMS, and describe the parameters of the author ity granted to the state. They are legally binding upon the state and are designed to clearly layout the state's commitment to its Medicaid stakeholders, and the state's implementation and financing approach to medical assistance services under the demonst ration authority. CMS previously approved Indian STCs in the 1915(b) behavioral health waiver in Idaho . We request that this 1115 demonstration waiver include Indian STCs that expressly state applicable federal law, including tribal consultation require ments, Medicaid protections for AI/AN, and Indian managed care rules. CMS published an information bulletin on the Managed Care Rules . In addition, we request that th e STCs also include other provisions that will streamline the provision of services under the waiver that must be negotiated between the tribes and the state, such as conflict resolution, data collection and sharing, cultural competency training for state staff and Medicaid transformation initiatives . VII. 1115 Demonstration Waiver - Institution for Mental Diseases (IMDs) A. Purpose Currently, federal rules prohibit the use of Medicaid funds for treatment in IMDs. An IMD is a facility that is larger than 16 beds and primarily engages in the treatment of mental health or substance use disorder (SUD). The purpose of the Institution of M ental Diseases (IMD) 1115 Demonstration waiver is to allow Medicaid to pay for services provided to adults over age 20 and under age 65 in an IMD. IDHW anticipates the impact on AI/ANs will be to increase treatment May 10 , 2019 Page 10 options for Medicaid eligible IHS benefic iaries and Tribal health programs who assist their patients in paying for these services could see reductions in costs as coverage shifts to Medicaid. NPAIHB supports the 1115 Demonstration waiver for the state of Idaho to use Medicaid funds to pay for t reatment of SUD in IMD facilities. We recommend that language in the waiver allow for the use of Medicaid funds in IMD facilities, regardless of the length of stay for treatment. NPAIHB requests IDHW to provide an implementation plan to the tribes to under stand the state process to: (1) provide access to a full array of SUD services; (2) implement comprehensive treatment and prevention strategies to address opiate use disorder (OUD) and SUD; and (3) ensure improved care coordination and transitions. VIII. Conclusion NPAIHB hopes that IDHW and DOI , in the spirit of its partnership and shared interest in improving AI/AN health care in Idaho will conduct meaningful consultation, extend the commend deadline period and work with Idaho Tribes prior to the submission of the waivers to CMS . Our comments are intended to uphold the federal trust responsibility and to ensure that resources continue to be invested in and improve the India n health system. We thank you for this opportunity to provide our comments and recommendations and look forward to further engagement with IDHW and DOI on the development and implementation of the 1115 demonstration waiver and 1332 waiver, respectively.

One of the primary go~ernme~~ \u00b7ai services provided to ~ur tribal membership is health care and with the approval ofldaho's Medicaid expansion coverage, the Tribes are better suited to collaborate on payment and billing services with the Indian Health Service (IBS) and other health care providers. to provide improved health care services' for tribal patient populations. The Tribes have reserved rights as ~et forth in the Fort :Bridg~r Treaty of July 3, 1868, between the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and the United States. Since those reserved treaty rights include health services, it is lhe responsibil .ity of the Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Indian Health s~rvice (IHS) to ensure adequate health care is avail,able to American Indians who use our health care facility. \u00b7: \u00b7~ In the 2019 approvals by the Idaho Legislature and Governor Little of Medicaid expansion who included additional requirements , along with an exemption for American Indians/Alaska June 12, 2019 IDHW and DOI Medicaid Expansion waivers Page2 Natives who are eligible for services through the Indian health service or through a tribal health program pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.

Congress has declared that \"it is the policy of this Nation, 'in' fulfillment of its special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to Indians ... to ensure the highest possible health status for 125 u.s.c. \u00a7 1601 Junel2,2019 IDHW and DOI Medicaid Expansion waivers Page 3 Indians and urban Indians and to provide all resources necessary to effect that policy.\"2 This authorization allowed tribes to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services and since then, Medicaid is a critically important component of the Indian health funding stream, and allows many Indian Health Care Providers (IHCPs) to begin to address some of the chronic health disparities fac~d by Indian people in the U.S. ::. Without meaningfUI access to M~dicaid respurces, many IHCPs would be unable to maintain cuJTent levels of service.

Additionally, The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes request that IDOi and Your Health Idaho Qualified Health.Plans (QIJ;Ps) be more engaged with Tribes throughout 1the process. Medicaid Expansion Tribal Impacts In November 2018, Idahoans voted, via a referendum, to expand Medicaid in accordance with the ACA, which allows Medicaid eligibility to individuals with income up to 13 8% FPL who were 2 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(a)(I) June 12, 2019 10.HW and DOI Medicaid Expansion waivers Page4 not previously eligible for Medicaid under previously establishe-<I eligibility categories (age, disability, parental status, etc.). The Idaho legislature authorized and modified Medicaid expansion with their own additional requirements in Senate Bill 12043, instructing the IDHW and IDOI to seek a waiver from the federal government to permit individuals and families who have an adjusted gross income at or above 100% FPL to receive the Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) to purchase a coverage plan through the Jdaho health insurance exchange, notwithstanding the implementatio n of Medicaid expan&ion. Any jndividual who is eligible for Medicaid may still choose to emolJ in Metlicaid instead of rec~jving the APTC to purchase a qualified health plan. Medicaid expansion allov .. 'S IHS and.

For example, trih&l patJel1ts often resort to \"si;asonaJ sickness\" based on the fiscal year, knowing if referrals are 11;e(;css~ry tp wait until October when funding is available for 11on-erne_rgency rc;~fcrrals.

This alleviates 100% of ldaho.'s responsibility to all.ocate state general fuqdsto me~t the cost of care provided at I HS or l~ibal health facilities. In 2016, CMS released guiQance that expands the scope of services considered \"received th.rough\" an IHS/Tribal facility that may qualify for 100% federal match.4 Expanding the scope of services that can quaJify for l 00% fccleral match provides potential increasel ~avings to states and incentives to increase \u00b7access to care for AI!

There are also several other benefits and protections for AI/AN under the ACA and IHCIA. The State ofldaho, through the IDOi and in conjunction with Idaho's state-run health insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, is submitting the Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver (Section 1332 Waiver) request to the CMS and the U.S. Department of Treasury.

Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage tfon.1 Yom\u00b7 Health Idaho Lack of coverage has a direct negative impnct on the hea1th of an individual.

In accordance with section l 9'02(a)(73)(A) of the Social Security Act, in the case of any state in which one or more Tndian Health Programs or Urban Indian Organizations furnishes heath care services, state must provide for a process under which the state seeks advice on a regular, ongoing basis from designees of such Indian Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations on matters relating to the application prior to the submission of any Medicaid State June 12, 2019 lDHW and DOI Medicaid Expansion waivers Page 7 Plan Amendment (SPA), waiver requests, and proposals for demonstration projects that are likely to have a direct effect on Indians, Indian Health Programs, or Urban Indian Organizations. 5 To foster greater notice and a meaningful opportunity for input, in 2000, the Administration issued Executive Order 13175 regarding_ \"Consultation and Coordination with Indian and Tribal governments.' '6 This Executive Order applie.s to the programs operated by the F edernl government and, since States administer MedicaLd and CHIP, CMS has issued guidance to states to conduct consultation wi,th tribes prior to impiem.ent ifig J.

Work, Volunteering, Job Training, or Education The tribal notice also states (p. 2, Section 2(b )) that this 1115 waiver will require the adult Medicaid expansion coverage group to participate in work, volunteering, job training. or education as a condition of their eligibility. Per State's impact assessment on tribal members, ~'Tribal June 12, 2019 IDHW and DOI Medicaid Expansion waivers Page 9 members will be exempt from this requirement and there is no impact anticipated. Tribal health programs who serve non-tribal members may be impacted because some of the population they serve may be ineligible for Medicaid benefits because of these requirements.\" According to the Idaho SB 1204, an American Indian or Alaska Native who is eligible for services through the II-IS or through a tribal health program pursuant to the Indian Self-determination and Education Assistance Act and the Indian Heolth Care hnprovement Act is eligible for an exemption from the work, volunteering, j~b training or education Medicaid eligibility requirements. Since the exemption is broadet than tribal members, we remind the state to use the broader definition for the exemption to foclnt;Ie all Ali AN eLigible for the exemption.

Al/ANs receiving services at an HIS or tribal facility, and not enrolled in Medicaid's Healthy Connection pl'imary care program, would not be required to obtain such a referral even if the Aii AN patient js referred out to another provider for the services. We generally disagree with the requirement that individuals enrolled in Medicaid's Healthy CoMection primary care program be required to obtain a refe1Tal for family planning services and June 12, 2019 IDHW and DOI Medicaid Expansion waivers Page 10 supplies. Family planning services and supplies should. be made available to all Medicaid beneficiaries from any Medicaid provider without a referral from their primary care provider.

Sincerely,Muriel Roberts 545 1/2 S 19th AvePocatello, ID 83201 From: Mr. & Mrs. Kevin Ward To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019 7:10:07 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, We are concerned about Idaho's Medicaid Expansion Plan due to the 1332 Waiver Application for many reasons. First, the plan proposes to offer the choice of the health exchange rather than Medicaid. Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage than private insurance, especially in offering services to Idahoans with mental illness. Second, Idahoans must be informed about the benefits they will receive, as well as out of pocket costs, (premiums and copays) depending on their options. Third, Idahoans up to 138% FPL will be eligible for Medicaid. They should not have to decline exchange coverage in order to learn more about Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid is more affordable and stable than exchange insurance plans. Exchange plans require monthly premiums and deductibles. This must be explained to the Medicaid eligible Idahoans. These Idahoans should not have to decline private coverage to access Medicaid. Currently they pay higher out-of-pocket costs than in Medicaid and ca not afford doctors and prescription. Why are 10,000 eligible Idahoans not on the exchange? Is it due to the cost of health insurance? These Idahoans deserve a comprehensive insurance plan. These Idahoans should be able to access Medicaid coverage in a simpleand transparent process without any red tape or work requirements. Safeguards must be in place to meet their needs.

These low- income families need dependable and inclusive medical coverage for their families without incurring significantly higher out-or-pocket costs, and they should be provided full information about all of their options before making adecision. Sincerely,Vance Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Tuesday, June 11, 2019 1:40:19 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, A significant number of people who fall in the 100%-138% of the federal poverty line have serious mental health issues and insurance on the exchange does not cover these issues nearly as well. I am also deeply concerned that if someone fails to pay their premium, they would likely lose their coverage also. I am also concerned that folks may not have adequate information about the differences between what Medicaid will cover versus insurance on the exchange.

Sincerely,Del Blackburn 32020 S Bella Vista To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 10, 2019 9:50:07 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I object to the bait and switch changes that the legislature has made to the citizens initiative. The objective of the Medicaid expansion was to provide low cost and comprehensive insurance plans to our fellow citizens. The changes made by the legislature appear to have been made specifically to reduce the opportunity for our fellow citizens toobtain health care coverage. Any individual who is seeking coverage should have all available options explained to them. It is not right that citizens should have to reject one policy before they can find out about other options that could be available to them.Consumers should have full information about ANY out of pocket costs for both Medicare and marketplace policies as well as what services and benefits are available with those policies. They should have an opportunity to understand the trade-offs between costs and coverage so that they may make an informed decision about the coverage they choose. Choosing a policy with intentionally incomplete information is hard enough without withholding information on options that are available. Safeguards must be in place to ensure consumer choice is not biased by the interests of the State of Idaho, insurance companies or health care providers. A true choice for consumers is one where they are completely informed of theiroptions.

I wish to express my concern regarding 1332 Waiver Application before your department as the potential for serious negative impact upon those Idaho citizen most in need of basic medical coverage. I'm referring to Idahoans who have in the past fall into the 'Gap Population' meaning they earned too much to qualify for current Medicaid coverage but too little to qualify for subsidies on the state health insurance exchange. Now, with this 1332 WaiverApplication, it may add a layer of confusion and lack of clarity to what exactly this same group of people will actually receive. By encouraging those who originally did not qualify for the state exchange to now be required to apply (instead of being eligible for Medicaid Expansion), these citizens will need a level of coaching and support tofirst understand the various options/plans available and even with well informed enrollees, some of the cost-sharingmeasures that are apart of state exchange health insurance policies, might present barriers to these same people to continue coverage long term. Other concerns I have include ensuring the overall enrollment process for Medicaid be clearly mapped out,transparent to the newcomer and unbiased by private insurance companies or health care providers that may have astake in how coverage is distributed among the eligible population. Unless these and other reasonable concerns regarding the difference between what private insurance plans cover and what Medicaid itself provides so that applicants have informed choices, I am opposed to this waiver application. Thank you for the chance to submit public opinion and thank you for taking these comments into consideration as Medicaid Expansion in Idaho rolls out.

All 5 members of our former immediate family unit, currently live independently of one another, but maintain close contact and frequent visiting.I have been receiving assistance for my health care since I became eligible for Medicare, through a Pacific Source Medicare plan, which has effectively served my health needs for the past 7 years, or a bit more.I am also still able to continue working part- time to help cover my basic living, health, and recreational costs. My health issues now include rather severe Osteoporosis and Osteo Arthritis, a tendency to high blood sugar, a high level of undesirable cholesterol, and some mental health issues which have only manifested in the last few years, buthave become a significant concern. I have seen an excellent PCP on a regular basis, since the start of my Pacific Source Medicare plan and have been referred to other care providers on multiple occasions, including a semi-emergency treatment for a retinal tear in myleft eye, which could have resulted in blindness in that eye, had it been left untreated, by an excellent eye surgeon inCoeur d'Alene (who now continues to monitor my eye health regularly) and more recently to a foot surgeon, also inCoeur d'Alene, as some bone structure issues in my feet may result in the need foot surgery in the near future. I am very happy with the care I have received through this insurance plan, which is primarily supported by the federal government, with some cooperation on the State level, and am indeed, quite dependent on continuing toreceive the quality of care I have been receiving, @ the extremely low premium rates and very high level ofcoverage, especially on co-pays, which I have been eligible for, in order to continue to take care of my health, and continue to lead an active and productive life. My regular health care has in the last year, included regular weekly visits with an excellent counselor, who has alsoreferred me to several specialists to address my mental health concerns. It is essential that all Idahoans be provided with detailed information about the benefits package that might come into play w. any change in health care program administration, so that all concerned individuals can evaluatewhatever the changes might entail, like a possible reduction in critically needed services, to be able to maintain theirhealth in the most affordable and functionally successful way.

I had a stroke, I had health coverage, but when it came time to renew my policy, they raised my payment from $300/month to $1500/month. That was Blue Cross. They paid for my recovery from my stroke and I would have lost everything if I didn't have insurance. I choose to pay the monthly payment until the Affordable Care Act kicked in that January. That saved my money I had saved for my retirement. I was lucky that I could afford the payment. Most people are not as fortunate as I was at that time and I only had to pay the monthly increase for 6 months.

The fact is that Medicaid coverage is a better and more comprehensive and reliable option. I strongly disagree that this waiver is needed\u2014 it will cost the state and people of Idaho even more to manage it.Most importantly, if this waiver goes through, the state must expend (I demand that it must!) significant resources toinform citizens and proactively aid them to navigate a complex system, and ensure that they are given the bestinformation and opportunity to make informed decisions about health insurance. They should be encouraged, notdiscouraged in any way, to sign up for Medicaid if they have a choice. Let's make it easy and humane for Idaho residents to obtain and maintain the proper health coverage! Peoples lives are busy and complex and dynamic \u2014- few, especially those folks who also live with mental or physical health challenges, can afford to have a system made even harder for them. The state should encourage all Idahoans to enroll in the Medicaid coverage if they qualify. Marketing and multilingual information must be provided that describes the options honestly and does not lean in favor of theprivate companies.Do what is right for Idahoans first, helping them live stable and healthy lives, not serving insurance companyinterests.

Having said that, Ifeel strongly that in order to adopt the 1332 Waiver Application, it is imperative that a comprehensive program bedeveloped to ensure that candidates for this waiver be fully and completely educated as to what the difference wouldbe between Medicaid coverage and private insurance being offered. The new Medicaid candidates must become educated consumers in order to opt out of Medicaid. If they are not, and they choose the 1332 waiver, I fear many will be without the health care coverage they need. Sincerely,Nadine Barth 3382 N Park Crossing AveMeridian, ID 83646 From: Gail Kirkpatrick To: DOI Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Thursday, June 6, 2019 4:00:08 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, This waiver concerns me for various reasons. First, there must be full transparency and informed consent on the differences between exchange insurance and medicaid - full costs, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and well as coverage given by each including mental health, hospital stays, and prescriptions. All of this information on bothchoices must be given before a decision is made by the client. Second, these individuals that will be covered are very low income, many times not knowing where food will come from let alone the cost for a doctor's visit. Medicaid will give them more stability, knowing that if they get sick they will be able to get care weather or not they have the co-pay or deductible amount. When these people get really sick, many times they lose their jobs and they need to be able to continue to get medical care for no additional cost (i.e. premiums, co-pays, etc.) Third, the cost of health insurance, even with subsidies from the government, is extremely high and certainly will be for people who have not had much medical care in the past. This demographic of people have little stability in their lives and if they have to chose between food for the children and paying a health insurance premium, obviously the food will win. And then what? They lose their health insurance and they're back where they started. Please look at this waiver from the recipients standpoint - they are not numbers, they are individual people that have stories that should be listened to. Sincerely,Gail Kirkpatrick 1987 S Springbrook Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Thursday, June 6, 2019 1:00:11 PM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, This 1332 waiver application leaves many questions and concerns regarding actual implementation. Medicaid is a more comprehensive and stable benefit than exchange plans. The general public does not know the differences inMedicaid and private insurance. When people go to an insurance agent to sign up for coverage will they be informedof the differences in benefit and cost to the consumer? Currently, Medicaid is accessed through the Department ofHealth and Welfare. How are insurance agents outside of the department going to be trained on the Medicaidprogram and the benefits it provides? What safeguards will be in place to ensure consumers are adequately informedand not steered to private insurance that benefits the insurance agent? Many would agree that navigating thecomplex world of health insurance is intimidating and the average person relies on the recommendations of a trustedprofessional - the insurance agent - to steer them to the best possible plan for their health needs. Agents also don'treceive compensation for helping consumers enroll in Medicaid, this leads to an increase risk in bias of the insurance agent in the recommendation of health coverage. What happens if a consumer between 100-138% of FPL that chooses an exchange plan and then fails to pay their premium? Will they be automatically enrolled in Medicaid?For this change in the law to reflect a true choice there needs to be a system in place to ensure consumers areadequately informed of their health care options taking into consideration health needs, income, and financialcapability. Consumers need to be shown the comparison between Medicaid and private insurance benefits and coststo make the best choice for their families. Comment 1332 Waiver Application Date: Thursday, June 6, 2019 11:50:07 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I believe that if the 1332 Waiver is approved, people who are eligible for Medicaid should have the opportunity to make a really informed choice between Medicaid and the tax credits to purchase marketplace insurance. They should be given good information about the costs and benefits and disadvantages of each choice--enrolling in Medicaid or taking the federal tax credits for marketplace health insurance, and then given the choice to enroll in theplan that best suits them.

The proposed choice between Medicaid and ACA exchange insurance for some individuals needs to be fully explained to those involved. For example there are differences in mental health coverage which could significantly affect Idahoans. There are also differences in copays that must be explained. Overall Medicaid provides more reliable coverage and isgenerally less costly than private coverage. There needs to be total transparency and the ability to have a true choicewhere it is not necessary to decline ACA coverage before learning of Medicaid coverage and eligibility.

Full and unbiased information must be made available to all Idahoans who want to explore the options of private insurance and Medicaid. There are many safeguards that must be put in place to protect consumer choice from any biases of insurance companies or health care providers. Also, cost-sharing for Medicaid users should be avoided, since it might result in them getting less health care if they feel they can't afford the cost-sharing.Sincerely,Alice Stevenson 1101 Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Saturday, June 22, 2019 11:00:07 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, Medicaid is a very viable program and Idaho should make it available.Sincerely,Mary Jane Marlow 485 S Winslow Bay To: Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Saturday, June 22, 2019 8:50:06 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I have a concern that Idaho citizens who fall into the health care \"gap\" may again fall into another \"gap\" if they make a choice to go with a private insurance plan that they didn't clearly understand what benefits it offered and didn't offer. Private insurance may not be the best care in some cases. My hope is that there is some clear and understandable communication made available for these folks who fall into the gap category and can now have Medicaid cover their health care needs.

Sincerely,Judy Halverson 431 S Curtis Reform Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Application Date: Monday, June 24, 2019 11:00:25 AM Dear DOI Bureau Chief, I am concerned about the 1352 Waiver Application the State of Idaho is applying for. I worked for over 30 years at Terry Reilly Healrh Services, initially as a registered dietitian and then doing program management and grant writing/fundraising. At the time, over 60% of our population were uninsured. Many also had low educational levels. Most were part of working families. My concern is that folks newly eligible for Medicaid be presented with the pros and cons of Medicaid coverage vs private insurance. They need to be aware of what is covered and what is not, and at what premium or co-pay price. It is especially important to check for parity in mental health diagnoses with other medical conditions. The process needs to be transparent, with explanations of Medicaid first before the private option. Co-payments forprivate plans add up, with research showing that even modest ones deterring visits to a health care provider. Thank you for this opportunity to make comments. Ann Sandven, MPH medical conditions. Sincerely,Ann Sandven 1916 Comment on 1332 Date: Monday, June 24, 2019 11:20:18 AM Our adult daughter has a condition that makes full time employment overwhelming. So she takes part-time work that doesn't pay well and lacks benefits. If she had to make a choice between state coverage or medicaid she would havea hard time understanding the commitment to the premiums, copays, and prescription benefits versus the advantagesof medicaid. She is intelligent but struggles to \"see the forest for the trees.\" She works hard to get by-and we continue to support her. We're 70 and small business owners trying to retire so it's not easy to imagine a future where we would have to help her with health care. We believe the state should lessen the burden of managing the complexities of health care coverage with the state plan and provide medicaid coverage for those who have disadvantages physically and mentally like our daughter. Peace of mind would be a welcome improvement for all of us! Thank you for considering our issues.

Mental health coverage is much better under medicaid than private insurance and patients need to know that. Costs for premiums and co-pays vary as well and that needs to be made clear. There needs to be no bias given to private insurance and the possible cost assistance definitely needs to be weighed and made clear to people.

The applicationseems to indicate that people would only be notified of their Medicaid eligibility if they turn down their tax credit. Ifthis is true, this doesn't present a true choice at all. Idahoans should have all of their options presented to them upfront and transparently, without influences of insurance companies or represntatives that have incentives to steerpeople into private plans rather than Medicaid. Medicaid provides more comprehensive coverage than plans on the exchange. While exchange plans are certainly still ACA compliant and quality, they don't offer the same depth of ocverage and services to enrollees as Medicaiddoes. For Idahoans with mental illness, they are likely to be better suited by Medicaid coverage. Medicaid is morelikely to cover detoxification services, individual and group therapy, medication management, case management,and psychiatric hospital visits. It is vital that when offered coverage, Idahoans with mental illness are counseledaccurately on their options so that they can choose a plan that best suits their needs. I think that the approach to reach deficit neutrality in the waiver is problematic. It ignores that under current law, people between 100-138% FPL will be eligible for Medicaid and not subsidized exchange coverage. Allowing thisgroup of people to claim a monthly tax credit to cover their premium costs, as the waiver proposes, will actuallyincrease federal spending relative to current law. Figures from a previous 1332 application in 2018 indicate the sameproblem, that covering this population through subsidized private insurance instead of expanded Medicaid will bemore expensive for the federal government. I do not think the waiver meets this burden. The waiver presents many administrative challenges and unanswered questions. I hope that problems in the application are substantively addressed or that the proposal is reconsidered.

Box 83720 Boise, Idaho 83720 Re: Section 1332 Waiver Public Comment On behalf of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) and the thousands of Idahoans living with blood cancer, we thank you for the opportunity to comment today. While LLS appreciates the efforts of the Idaho Department of Insurance to create choice in the health insurance market, we are concerned that the waiver as proposed will have a negative impact on Idahoans' access to meaningf ul coverage and urge the department to address these concerns prior to submitting this waiver to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. At LLS, our mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma , Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, arnd improve the quality of IU:e of patients and their families. We support that mission by ensuring that blood cancer patients have sustainable access to quality, affordable, coordinated healthcare. We are confident that meaningful engagemen t with the departme nt can advance access to care for Idahoans with blood cancer and thus very much appreciate youir consideration of stakeholder input from organizations like LLS. Research shows that people with lower incomes are more likely to develop certain cancers and die from the disease.1 For that reason, among many others, Medicaid is a crucial safety net program for those living witt:h chronic and life-threatening diseases like cancer. Indeed, access to Medicaid increases the chance that cancer will be detected earlier, increases access to appropriate treatment, and improves survival.2For example, states that expanded Medicaid experienced a 6.4 percent increase in early detection of cancer from pre-Affordable Care Act (ACA) levels.3 Further, Medicaid expansion lhas helped to all but eliminate disparities in timely access to cancer treatment between African Americans and white patients that existed prior to the implementat ion of Medicaid expansion.4 One of LLS's primary concerns with the proposed waiver is that it does not address whether or how the department will ensure that those in the expansion population (i.e. Idahoans with income between 100-138% of the federal poverty level) will have the information necessary to identifying the coverage option that will best suit their needs. !nformation regarding affordability will be especially critical for the expansion population, as imposing copayments or out-of-pocket costs on low-income populations has been shown to decrease the likelihood that they will seek health care services, including 1 Facts & Figures 2018.

Thus, Medicaid -rather than commercial coverage -is likely to be the better coverage option for many in this population. It's important to note that providing tax credits to individuals for buying exchange coverage is much more costly to the federal government than enrolling them in Medicaid. In a 2018 financial analysis, the state of Idaho found that covering the cost of a tax subsidy for an individual in the expansion population would cost the federal government approximately $7,700 while enrolling an individual in Medicaid would cost approximately $3,800. Given the profound importance of increasing access to coverage for low income Idahoans, LLS strongly urges the state to implement its waiver in a manner that maximizes resources . Expanding Medicaid provides nearly 62,000 Idahoans access to the care they need to manage their health and treat disease. For cancer patients and others living with serious medical need, access to primary care providers, specialists, prescription drugs, and other services is essential to their well-being. Thank you again for your consideration of stakeholder voices on this important healthcare issue. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure all Idahoans can have access to quality, affordable, coordinated healthcare.

Box 83720 Boise, Idaho 83720-0043 Subject: 1332 Waiver Dear Bureau Chief: The Idaho Academy of Family Physicians (IAFP) appreciates this opportunity to comment onthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Section 1332 Waiver applicationallowing Idahoans below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) a choice of health coverage options. While the IAFP is grateful for the work of the policymakers and the department to make thisoption of benefit for all those who qualify for Medicaid expansion, we are concerned about the lack of transparency in this particular waiver request, which raise questions about how it would be implemented and its impact on affordability and coverage. The IAFP Board of Directors is concerned that under this waiver Idahoans may not be fully informed when it comes to their health insurance options. The application seems to indicate that Idahoans in the 100-138%FPL income range would be first screened for Medicaid, butthen directed towards private coverage on the exchange rather than presented a choice between private insurance and Medicaid. This confusing process creates additional barriers for Idaho citizens trying to access care, and was not the intent of Idaho voters whenproposition two was approved by 61% of Idaho voters. The IAFP empowers family physicians to improve the health of their patients and their communities. Our physician members provide primary care to Idahoans all across the state. Access to quality healthcare for the local citizens is paramount to the strength of communities. We know that having a usual source of care and healthcare coverage helps citizens stay healthier and be more productive. The IAFP would like to ensure that our citizens between 100-138% FPL receive coverage information in a clear and concise way sothey are able to make an educated decision about their healthcare coverage. Transparencyof choice is vital to this process. If Idahoans have to decline private insurance before being able to enroll in Medicaid or evenlearn of the option for Medicaid coverage, then this isn't a well-informed choice. Medicaid coverage is more comprehensive than private insurance. Idahoans with mental illness will likely find Medicaid better tailored to their needs than private coverage. Medicaid is more likely to cover case management, individual and group therapy, detoxification, subspecialist care, hospitalizations and various other services. In addition to offering better coverage, Medicaid is also more affordable with lower cost-sharing and out of pocket expenses. Almost 10,000 Idahoans are eligible for plans on the exchange but don't purchase a plan because it is too expensive. Even with tax credits, the exchange is still more expensive than Medicaid. The following questions need addressed prior to submitting the waiver request. --[if !supportLists]--> 1. <!--[endif]--> Will Idahoans with behavioral health conditions be adequately counseled on what options are available to them? --[if !supportLists]--> 2. <!--[endif]--> Will they be informed of what private insurance might not cover? --[if !supportLists]--> 3. <!--[endif]--> Will Idahoans be told they will lose their coverage if they fail to pay their premiums? Family physicians care for the majority of Medicaid recipients in Idaho and will care for this newly enrolled population. Research has shown that even small amounts of cost sharing are associated with reduced use of care. The state should prioritize affordable and comprehensive options for its citizens; the plans on the exchange offer coverage but they do not match the comprehensiveness and affordability that Medicaid offers Idahoans. Family physicians, especially those in small rural communities, depend on the coverage Medicaid provides to keep their patients healthy and keep their practices viable. Since family physicians will be communicating with their patients about which plan may suit them, it is essential that our members be informed about Medicaid coverage. The IAFP is happy to partner with the department to ensure our physician members are well informed about the aspects of coverage. We want to propose that Medicaid coverage not be influenced by brokers or financial interests. Please make sure the process is transparent for all those involved. The choice of an exchange policy or Medicaid coverage must be fair and transparent for all involved. Idahoans need an up front and detailed description of what they are eligible for. Please provide a clear understanding of the options for our patients and the citizens in our communities. Thank you for your consideration.

Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0043 Dear Director Cameron: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on Idaho's \"Coverage Choice Waiver Application.\" Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life -threatening genetic disease that affects 30,000 children and adults in the United States. CF causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive system, which can lead to life -threatening infections. As a complex, multi -system condition, CF requires targeted, specialized treatment and medications. Medicaid is a crucial source of coverage for patients with serious and chronic health care needs, including those with CF \u2014often serving as a payer of last resort, filling important gaps in coverage left by private health plans . Specifically, Medicaid helps people living with CF to afford the increasingly cos tly co -pays and co -insurance rates for prescription medications and inpatient and outpatient care, ensuring access to life-saving services and helping them to maintain their health and well -being. They Cystic Fibrosis Foundation believes everyone should have access to quality and affordable health coverage. While we are not opposed to efforts to increase plan choice for Idaho ans, we want to ensure this policy does not disrupt access to affordable, adequate coverage for people with CF. Should this waiver be approved, we urge you to ensure the proposed policies do not create additional confusion resulting in lower income individuals and families enrolling in more expensive and potentially less - comprehensive coverage. We also ask the state to not promote less-comprehensive coverage through this waiver , which could bifurcate the individual market and drive up prices for people with serious health care needs. Affordab ility and comprehensiveness of coverage The Coverage Choice Waiver would allow individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level to choose to enroll in either Medicaid or private insurance through the Idaho State Exchange. Private health insurance, even with Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and cost -sharing r eductions (CSRs), is more expensive than Medicaid. By law, Medicaid cost -sharing cannot exceed more than five percent of an enrollee's income. Typically, Medicaid enrollees do not pay premiums and have minimal CYSTIC FIBROSIS FOUNDATION 4550 MONGTOMERY AVE, cost-sharing. Those enrolled in private insura nce are required to pay premiums and are subject to additional cost -sharing in the forms of co -pays, co -insurance and deductibles. Research shows that even limited cost -sharing can deter low -income individuals from accessing necessary healthcare services.i While both Medicaid expansion plans and private insurance sold on the exchange are required to cover the ten essential health benefits, there are some additional services Medicaid is required to cover, but private insurance is not. For example, Medicaid expansion plans provide non -emergency transportation services, a benefit private insurance does not provide. Additionally, Medicaid covers certain home health services and other services that private insurance is not required to cover. Detailed plan information and cost comparisons To ensure enrollees fully understand the differences in their coverage options, robust and unbiased enrollment assistance will be crucial. The Cover Choice Waiver application does not provide specific information on how individ uals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level will be informed about their healthcare choices. Will these individuals be presented the option to enroll in Medicaid when they start the open enrollment process, or will that option only be presented if they decline private coverage through the exchange? The latter scenario does not lead to true consumer choice . To ensure enrollees have the ultimate freedom to choose Medicaid or an exchange plan that best meets their health care needs , state -sponsored enrollment assistance must be upfront and neutral about the risks and benefits of all available option s. We request the state provide clear, detailed, and unbiased plan information and cost comparisons so enrollees can make an informed ch oice on which plan is best for them and their families. Limitations on APTCs for ACA -compliant plans We greatly appreciate the state 's decision to continue requir ing enrollees use APTCs to purchase Affordable Care Act (ACA) -compliant plans. T his provision should remain in place no matter what types of plans are offered on the Your Health Idaho state -based exchange. APTCs or cost-sharing reduction subsidies should not be offered for the purchase of non -compliant plans. Promotin g enrollment in non - compliant plans could bifurcate the individual market between younger, healthier people and people with serious health conditions who need comprehensive coverage, driving up the cost of coverage for the later. Budget Neutrality Additi onally , while the proposed Coverage Choice Waiver claims to meet the budget neutrality guardrail for a 1332 waiver, this does not appear to be accurate based on the information provided . The waiver incorrectly calculates the budget neutrality assuming Medi caid expansion does not exist and the individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in exchange coverage would otherwise be uninsured. This is incorrect, as they would be otherwise enrolled in Medicaid expansion. Moreover , it is more expensive for the federal government for individuals between 100 and 138 percent FPL to enroll in exchange coverage than Medicaid expansion. A previous Idaho 1332 waiver analysis found that APTC and cost -sharing reductions for individuals between 100 and 138 percent of FPL would cost the federal government $7,700 per person. The same analysis found Medicaid expansion would cost the federal government $3,878 per person. ii CYSTIC MD 20814 WEB: WWW.CFF.ORG The proposed waiver application does not include the actuarial analysis ne eded to understand costs and coverage implications of this waiver. This information is needed as part of a complete application. Absent the official actuarial analysis, previous estimates imply the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the budget neutrality guardrail. We recommend you revisit the budget neutrality and analysis section of this waiver so that you and third-party organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, can have a more accurate understanding of how this proposal will impact the state and federal budgets. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation believes healthcare should affordable, accessible, and adequate and appreciates your attention to these important issues. As the health care landscape continues to evolve, we look forward to working with the state of Idaho to improve the lives of all people with cystic fibrosis.

Box 83720; Boise, Idaho 83720-00436/29/19 Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Idaho's 1332 Coverage Choice waiver application. While Close the Gap Idaho understands the desire to provide a choice of health coverage options,many factors about this waiver request raise concerns about implementation and its impact on affordability and coverage for Idahoans between 100-138% FPL. The notion of choice is desirable and fair, but Close the Gap fears that this waiver could potentially be implemented in a manner thatleaves Idahoans without an honest choice. After reviewing the waiver application, Close the Gap remains concerned regarding the transparency of health care options for Idahoans eligible for Medicaid expansion. The waiver application appears to indicate that Idahoans in the 100-138%FPL income range would be first screened for Medicaid, but instead funneled towards private coverage on the exchange first rather than presented a choicebetween private insurance and Medicaid, which they would be legally eligible for starting on January 1, 2020. Will Idahoans have both options presented to them at the same time? What materials will they be given regarding their Medicaid eligibility? Will they have to decline their advanced premium tax credit before learning of their eligibility? Will Insurance representatives be adequately trained toprovide information about the differences between private insurance and Medicaid? How will the state ensure that incentives of insurance representatives don't steer Idahoans towards a coverage option that might not be their best fit? If Idahoans have to decline private insurance before being able to enroll in Medicaid or even learn of the option for Medicaid coverage, then this isn't an honest choice. What's more, many Idahoansmay choose to remain uninsured if they believe that private insurance which they may not be able to afford is their first option. We believe that an unclear enrollment process may discourage Idahoans from seeking coverage in the first place, we hope that these concerns will be addressed before toensure a smooth process for the state as well as enrollees. Even though the plans on the exchange are ACA compliant, they do not offer the same comprehensive coverage as Medicaid. Idahoans with mental illness are likely to be better served byMedicaid, will they be informed of this when they enroll? Medicaid is more likely to cover detoxification services, individual and group therapy, medication management, case management, and psychiatric hospital visits. These are crucial services for many Idahoans, and they need be made aware of this when they are presented a choice of health care options. Medicaid is also a more affordable health insurance option for Idahoans. Under Medicaid, enrollees won't be burdened by monthly premiums and cost sharing associated with private insurance. Research shows that even small amounts of cost sharing ranging from $5-$20 is likely to reduce use of care. Given that around 10,000 Idahoans are currently eligible to purchase insurance on the exchange but choose to remain uninsured, it is clear that cost is an important factor in coverage options for Idahoans. Will Idahoans be informed/educated about their premiums and deductibles up front at the time of enrollment? Close the Gap has no issue with Idahoans choosing to purchase private insurance instead of enrolling in Medicaid, but we believe that eligible Idahoans need to be presented the price differences of their health care options. In addition to concerns over Medicaid eligible Idahoans, Close the Gap believes that this 1332 waiver application does not meet the deficit neutrality guardrail. Current law assumes Medicaid eligibility of those in the 100-138% FPL range. Covering these people through Medicaid is less expensive for the federal government than subsidizing their private coverage monthly. In Idaho's 2018 proposal for a different 1332 waiver, the state's analysis found that it would cost the federal government $7,700 per person per year to cover the 100-138% income group in subsidized exchange plans in 2019. To cover the same group via Medicaid expansion in 2019 was projected to cost the federal government $3,878 per person per year. Idaho is a state that takes pride in spending tax payer dollars in an efficient manner. When compared to clean Medicaid expansion, this waiver would increase federal costs and spend tax dollars in sub optimal way. There is nothing wrong with the prospect of choice, as long as it is fair and transparent. We have many concerns that we hope are addressed before this waiver is approved or implemented. We hope that these concerns will be taken into consideration, and that if approved this waiver will be implemented in a manner that provides all eligible Idahoans a transparent and easy path to navigate towards the health insurance option that best suits them. -- Close the Gap Idaho closethegapidaho.org Product Review Bureau Chief Department of Insurance P.O.

Please let us know if you have any questions and please acknowledge receipt of these comments. Best Liz WoodruffAssistant DirectorIdaho Voices for Children 1607 W. Jefferson St., Boise, ID 83702 idahovoices.org | (208) Idaho Voices for Children is a Program of Jannus, Inc. June 30, 2019 Product Review Bureau Chief Department of Insurance P.O. Box 83720; Boise, Idaho 83720-0043 To Whom It May Concern: Idaho Voices for Children respectfully submits these comments in response to the 1332 \"Coverage Choice\" waiver applicatio n prepared by the Idaho Department of Insurance. Idaho Voices for Children champions policies that help Idaho's kids and families thrive. Because affordable health coverage makes such a huge impact on the well -being of Idaho families, we have worked to close the health coverage gap in I daho for the past several years. We are deeply invested in ensuring that Idaho's voter-approved Medicaid expansion is implemented in a way that supports low-income families in Idaho receiving comprehensive a nd affordable health coverage. We are concerned that the proposed \"coverage choice\" waiver could lead to losses in coverage and increased financial burden s for Idahoans newly eligible for Medicaid under expansion. While we understand the desire of some lawmakers in Idaho to provide a choice of coverage between Medicaid and exchange coverage, we are not confident that the proposed application does enough to clarify how this will be a true choice for Idahoans now eligible for Medicaid. For example, on page 6 of the application, it appears as though an Idahoan between 100-138% FPL will first have to decline coverage on the state exchange before they are informed about their option to choose Medicaid: \"Because we anticipate some individuals between 100 -138% FPL will decline their APTC and choose to enroll in Medicaid...\" Other materials from the state have indicated that until an individual declines their APTC credit they won't be informed of the option to enroll in Medicaid. Even more troubling, it appears that a person who does d ecline their APTC will then have to initiate a new process to begin Medicaid enrollment. To be a true choice, the option of exchange coverage vs. Medicaid must be shared in tandem and the full costs and benefits of each program should be provided side-by-side for the consumer. It is also unclear how a true choice can work seamlessly when eligibility for Medicaid and subsidized coverage through the exchange using advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) operate on different timelines. Medicaid expansion is intended to reduce the significant burden of health coverage costs for Idaho's low-income working families. Exchange plans require out -of-pocket costs while Medicaid does not. In most instances, Medicaid offers a better benefits package, especially for Idahoans with behavioral health conditions. Therefore, a process must be in place to ensure Idahoans are informed about the benefits package they will receive and the out -of-pocket costs, such as premiums and copays, they may incur depending on which plan they choose. 1607 W. Jefferson St., Boise, ID 83702 idahovoices.org | (208) Idaho Voices for Children is a Program of Jannus, Inc. If approved and implemented, this proposal must also include an approach to safeguard consumers from being steered into either Medicaid coverage or exchange coverage by providers, brokers, or insurance companies. Since the people who often help consumers choose their insurance plans have a vested financial interest in which insurance a given individual chooses, a process must be in place to ensure this choice is not unduly influenced by these vested interests. Further, we take issue with the claim on page 4 of the application that the voter measure to expand Medicaid in Idaho, which passed with 61% of the vote, \"threatened continued access to access to affordable health coverage options for individuals and families with income slightly above the federal poverty level.\" This claim is erroneous, as Medicaid is a comprehensive benefit with no cost-sharing requirements. Access to Medicaid provides an opportunity to Idahoans in this income range and poses no threat to insurance coverage. Also on page 4 of the application is the assertion that individuals on the exchange may not be able to \"maintain\" access to existing providers. We would like to formally request the insertion of data into this application to quantify the number of Idahoans on the exchange between 100- 138% that currently utilize providers that don't accept Medicaid coverage. We are concerned about the logistical aspects of administering the proposed program. For example, what if a family chooses private insurance and then fai ls to pay their premiums? How and when will they be made aware of the availability of Medicaid coverage? Or what if a family chooses to enroll in the exchange during open enrollment, and then has an unexpected medical event and determines they can't cover the deductible; would they be able to access retroactive Medicaid to help cover costs? And how would mid-year changes in coverage plans impact the deficit neutrality claims made in Idaho's application? It's important to note that the baseline assumption regarding deficit neutrality in the application is flawed. The table on page 6 does not assume a baseline of Medicaid expansion. On page 7 the application clearly states that the baseline is based on the 2019 individual market. Because these Idahoans will be eligible for Medicaid as of January 1, 2020, and this waiver, if approved, will not be implemented until that time, the baseline assumption (against which the 1332 waiver proposal is judged) must be that they will be covered through Medicaid rather than purchasing health insurance on the state exchange. Allowing this group of people to claim a monthly tax credit to cover their premium costs, as the waiver proposes, will actually increase federal spending relative to current law ; costing the federal government $3,822 more per person than covering them through Medicaid. We are disappointed that the actuarial analysis that supports the assertions in the application of deficit neutrality were not made available to the public during the public comment period. There are currently ~ 18,000 Idahoans between 100-138% FPL that have exchange coverage. There are also another 10,000 Idahoans between 100-138% that are not on the exchange. The application makes no mention of this population. In fact, this issue is noticeably absent from the explanation of Idaho's insurance market that begins on page 12 of the application. This group of individuals are likely not on the exchange because they cannot afford coverage, even with an APTC. If 1607 W. Jefferson St., Boise, ID 83702 idahovoices.org | (208) Idaho Voices for Children is a Program of Jannus, Inc. implemented, will the proposed \"ch oice\" to receive exchange coverage confuse these Idahoans who have already declined to purchase coverage on the exchange? It is very important that there is a clear path to Medicaid coverage for all Idahoans up to 138% FPL. Idaho is poised to make historic strides toward ensuring all families have comprehensive and affordable health coverage. This comes on the heels of a new report showing Idaho had the largest decline in enrollment\u201411 percent\u2014 of children in CHIP/Medicaid than any other state in the country. We are very concerned that many of these children are becoming uninsured as there is no clear evidence that they are all moving to employer -sponsored insurance. We know that when parents are insured, children are more likely to be insured. Will the p roposed waiver only serve to confuse families seeking health coverage, and therefore exacerbate this alarming trend in children's coverage in Idaho? While this waiver application is well intended, in its current form the proposal could create more confusion for families seeking affordable coverage options. This confusion could lead to lapses in coverage and increased financial burdens. Thank you for your consideration of our comments.

Box 1278 Boise, ID 83720- 0043 Boise, ID 83701 On behalf of the Idaho Hospital Association, I would like to submit comments regarding the Idaho 1332 waiver application. The Idaho Hospital Association represents every community hospital in the state of Idaho and has been a strong advocate for proposals that increase access to health coverage for Idahoans throughout the state. While we are supportive of the concept of choice for Idahoans, we have some concerns regarding the 1332 waiver application that we would like to submit for consideration. Idaho's 13 32 waiver application states the objective of its first goal is to \"Empower individuals to choose to participate in commercial health insurance coverage over public insurance options.\" We believe Idahoans who are eligible for coverage in this category shou ld have a true choice in their coverage. There should be no systemic bias to one type of coverage over another. The elements proposed in the 1332 waiver should not prevent, in any way, an Idahoan from having the coverage that best fits their needs. If this waiver is approved, there should be clear guidance that requires enrollees be provided all necessary informat ion to make an informed choice of the benefits and restrictions of each option . They should be able to compare the requirements, or lack thereof, for deadlines and payment of premiums, co-pays or deductibles. They should have accurate information regarding networks and provider participation. Enrollees mus t have a true choice of plans rather than an \"opt out\" of any specific plan. We cannot assume that a person enrolled in a plan on the Your Health Idaho (YHI) exchange prefers commercial insurance over Medicaid coverage . Those currently enrolled on YHI exchange plans didn't necessary choose that option over others. It was their only option given th eir income level. When they initially enrolled in the Idaho exchange, there was only one choice of payer type. Now that Medicaid is an option for this population, they must have true choice between the two rather than an \"opt out\" of one or the other. Any system approved by this waiver should not create a secondary gap. We must avoid the \"family glitch\" scenario some Idahoans face when an individual is not eligible for the exchange because they may have access to coverage through a spouse's employer sponso red plan. In these cases, they may have access to the employer sponsored plan but simply cannot afford to take up that coverage option. If an individual meets the criteria for Medicaid enrollment, they should not be excluded because a family member has emp loyer sponsored coverage. We appreciate this opportunity to submit comments. We support the option for some Medicaid eligible individuals to choose commercial insurance coverage, as long as it is an unbiased, informed choice.

Thank you for considering our comments.

Cameron Director Idaho Department of Insurance 700 West State Street, 3rd Floor P.O. Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720 -0043 Dear Director Cameron: Hemophilia Federation of America (HFA) and the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) are national non-profit organizations that represent individuals with bleeding disorders across the United States. Our missions are to ensure that individuals affected by h emophilia and other inherited bleeding disorders have timely access to quality medical care, therapies, and services, regardless of financial circ umstances or place of residence . HFA and NHF appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on Idaho's \"Coverag e Choice Waiver Application.\" HFA and NHF believe everyone should have access to quality and affordable health coverage. Unfortunately, this waiver will create additional confusion resulting in lower income individuals and families enrolling in more expe nsive and potentially less -comprehensive coverage. To ensure that all low -income patients, including patients with bleeding disorders, have access to and enroll in quality and affordable health care, Idaho should withdraw the Coverage Choice Waiver Applica tion. Affordability Most low -income Idahoans have lacked quality and affordable health care due to the state's previous refusal to expand its Medicaid program to 138 percent of the federal poverty level or about $2,390 a month for a family of three. In November 2018, voters in Idaho approved full expansion of the Medicaid program, but the Idaho legislature defied this decision and approved additional restrictions on coverage including a work reporting requirement. The Coverage Choice Waiver, also resulti ng from this legislation, will not improve these families' access to quality and affordable health care. The Coverage Choice Waiver would allow individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level to choose to enrollee in either Medicaid or private insurance through the Idaho State Exchange. Private health insurance, even with Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and cost -sharing reductions (CSRs), is more expensive than Medicaid. By law, Medicaid cost -sharing cannot exceed more than five percent of an enrollee's income. Typically, Medicaid enrollees don't pay premiums and have minimal cost -sharing. By contrast, individuals who enroll in private insurance are required to pay premiums and are subject to additional cost -sharing in the forms o f co-pays, co - insurance and deductibles. Research shows that even limited cost -sharing can deter low -income individuals from accessing necessary health care services.i For example , when Oregon implemented a premium in its Medicaid program, with a maximum p remium of $20 per month, almost half of enrollees lost coverage.ii In the present instance, Idaho's waiver application does not include the actuarial analysis to demonstrate that coverage under th e proposed waiver would be as affordable as without it. Based on the information available , and on previous experiences with similar population s, it appears the Coverage Choice Waiver does not meet the statu tory requirement that coverage under a 1332 waiver be as affordable as it would be absent the waiver. The C over age Choice Waiver application does not provide specific information on how individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level will be informed about their health care choices. Will these individuals be presented the option to enroll i n Medicaid when they start the open enrollment process, or will that option only exist if they decline private coverage through the exchange? If it is the lat ter, that is not a true choice. To further ensure enrollees would have a choice between exchange a nd Medicaid coverage, any enrollment assistance must be neutral and not biased towards one option or the other. Additionally, if a Medicaid -eligible individual enrolled in private insurance wishes to enroll in Medicaid during the middle of a plan year, can they change their coverage? For bleeding disorders patients , any gap in coverage can be detrimental to their prognosis and health. It is imperative that there is a clear and simple way for individuals to enrollee in Medicaid if they become eligible during a time other than open enrollment. Adequacy While both Medicaid expansion plans and private insurance sold in the exchange are required to cover the ten essential health benefits, there are some additional services that Medicaid is required to cover, but private insurance is not. For example, Medicaid expansion plans provide non -emergency transportation services, a benefit private insurance does not provide. Additionally, Medicaid covers certain home health services and other services, including things like case management, that private insurance is not required to cover . Again, to ensure that enrollees fully understand the differences in their coverage options, robust and unbiased enrollment assistance would be crucial. Budget Neutrality The proposed Coverage Choice Waiver claims to meet the budget neutrality guardrail for a 1332 waiver. Unfortunately, based on the information provided, this does not appear to be accurate. The waiver incorrectly calculates the budget neutrality assuming Medic aid expansion does not exist and the individuals between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level enrolled in exchange coverage would otherwise be uninsured. In fact, these individuals c ould be enrolled in Medicaid rather than left uninsured . On t op of that , it is more expensive for the federal government for individuals between 100 and 138 percent FPL to enroll in exchange coverage rather than Medicaid expansion. A previous Idaho 1332 waiver analysis found that APTC and cost-sharing reductions for individuals between 100 and 138 percent of FPL would cost the federal government $7,700 per person. The same analysis found Medicaid expansion would cost the federal government $3,878 per person.iii The proposed waiver application does not include the actua rial analysis needed to understand costs and coverage implications of this waiver. This information is needed as part of a complete application. Absent the official actuarial analysis, previous estimates suggest that the Coverage Choice Waiver does not mee t the budget neutrality guardrail. HFA and NHF believe that health care should affordable, accessible, and adequate. The Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver compromises the affordability of health care coverage for some of Idaho's most vulnerable residents , including people living with bleeding disorders . We therefore oppose this waiver. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Box 83720 Boise, Idaho 83720 -0043 Re: Draft Idaho Coverage Choice Waiver Application ViiV Health care appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to the Idaho Department of Insurance regarding the proposed Coverage Choice Waiver Application . ViiV is the only independent, global specialist company devoted exclusively to delivering advancements in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment and prevention to support the needs of people living with HIV (PLWH). From its inception in 2009, ViiV has had a singular focus to improve the health and quality of life of people aff ected by this disease and has worked to address significant gaps and unmet needs in HIV care. In collaboration with the HIV community, ViiV remains committed to developing meaningful treatment advances, improving access to its HIV medicines, and supporting the HIV community to facilitate enhanced care and treatment. As a manufacturer of HIV medicines, ViiV is proud of the scientific advances in the treatment of this disease. These advances have transformed HIV from a terminal illness to a manageable chronic condition. Effective HIV treatment can help people living with HIV (PLWH) to live longer, healthier lives, and has been shown to reduce HIV -related morbidity and mortality at all stages of HIV infection.1, 2 Furthermore, effective HIV treatment can also p revent the transmission of the disease.3 More than 1. 1 million people living in the United States are infected with HIV, and fifteen percent are unaware that they are infected.4 As of 2016 , there were 1,102 PLWH residing in Idaho .5 1 Severe P, Juste MA, Ambroise A, et al.

Accessed June, 19, 2019. 5 AIDS Vu, Idaho: https://aidsvu.org/state/idaho/ 2 Despite groundbreaking treatments that have slowed the progression and burden of the disease, treatment of the disease is low - only half of PLWH are retained in medical care, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).6 Medicaid has played a critical role in HIV care since the epidemic began, and it is the largest source of coverage for people living with HIV.7 It is imperative to preserve continuous access to comprehensive health care, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) for peop le with HIV in order to improve health outcomes and reduce new transmissions. Effective HIV Treatment Treatment of HIV is a dynamic area of scientific discovery, and treatment protocols are constantly changed and updated to reflect advances in medical sc ience. PLWH often face a variety of medical challenges that impede access to, retention in, and adherence to HIV care and treatment. Strict adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) - taking HIV medicines every day and exactly as prescribed - is essentia l to sustained suppression of the virus, reduced risk of drug resistance, and improved overall health.8 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) stated in its Guide for HIV/AIDS Clinical Care that \"adherence to ART is the major factor in ensuring the virologic success of an initial regimen and is a significant determinant of survival.\"9 Nonadherence - or skipping HIV medicines - may lead to drug- resistant strains of the virus for which HIV medicines are less effective.10 In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that resistance among people retained on ART ranged from four to 28 percent, while among people with unsuppressed viral load on first -line ART regimens, resistance ranged from 47 to 90 percent .11 Federal HIV clini cal treatment guidelines (DHHS Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV -1- Infected Adults and Adolescents12) emphasize the importance of adherence to ensure long -term treatment success. 13 The effective treatment of HIV is highly individualized and accounts for a patient's size, gender, treatment history, viral resistance, comorbid conditions, drug interactions, immune status, and side effects14. Aging beneficiaries who are living with HIV often experience non -HIV related comorbidities.15 Clinica lly significant drug interactions have been reported in 27 to 40 percent of HIV patients taking antiretroviral therapy requiring regimen changes or dose modifications.16 Medical challenges for PLWH also include an increased risk for, and prevalence of, como rbidities such as depression and substance use disorders,17 as well as cardiovascular disease, hepatic and renal disease, osteoporosis, metabolic 6 Understanding the HIV Care Continuum, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/factsheets/cdc -hiv-care -continuum.pdf Accessed June 19, 2019 7 Kaiser Family Foundation.

In studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), investigators have shown that when treating the HIV -positive partner with antiretroviral therapy,21 there were no linked infections observed when the infected partner's HIV viral load was below the limit of detection. Reduced transmissions no t only improve public health , but also save money. It is estimated PLWH who are not retained in medical care may transmit the virus to an average of 5.3 additional people per 100 -person years.22 Other studies estimate that each HIV positive patient may approach $338,400 in additional costs to the healthcare system over his or her lifetime even if diagnosed early and retained in care.23 Successful treatment with an antiretroviral regimen results in virologic suppression and virtually eliminates secondary HIV t ransmission to others. As a result, it is possible to extrapolate that successful HIV treatment and medical care of each infected patient may save the system up to $1.79 million by preventing24 further transmission to others. These savings can only occur, h owever, if PLWH are diagnosed, have access to medical care, receive treatment, and remain adherent to their prescribed therapy . Proposed Waiver While ViiV applaud s the state 's goal of offering low-income patient s choice in their health coverage , we are concerned that proper planning and execution is needed to ensure these efforts protect the health of PLWH . We respectfully offer the following comments: Informing Eligible Population ViiV encourages the state to take all possible measures to make sure the population covered by this waiver is aware of their option to enroll in Medicaid coverage. We encourage the state to take on the task of inform ing eligible individuals of this systemic change, and not leave t his crucial task up to private companies. Recently in the state of Georgia, 17,000 elderly and disabled individuals fell out of care because the state claims the individuals did not respond to their renewal notices, yet e ligible individuals 18 Joel Gallant, Priscilla Y Hsue, Sanatan Shreay, Nicole Meyer; Comorbidities Among US Patients With Prevalent HIV Infection \u2014A Trend Analysis, The Journal of Infectious Diseases, Volume 216, Issue 12, 19 December 2017, Pages 1525 -1533, https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jix518 19 Rodriguez -Penney, Alan T. et al. \"Co -Morbidities in Persons Infected with HIV: Increased Burden with Older Age and Negative Effects on Health -Related Quality of Life.\" AIDS Patient Care and STDs 27.1 (2013): 5 -16.

We also encourage the state to provide consumers with clear information about drug coverage formularies, cost -shari ng and access to medical care providers, including specialists, under both Medicaid and plans in the exchanges . This information is critical to patients with serious conditions , such as PLWH, in order to ensure they are able to maintain their health , stay retained in medical care, and remain adherent to necessary medications . Continuous Coverage ViiV is concerned that during this transition, those PLWH who change coverage sources might be left vulnerable to dangerous interruptions in their care and treatment. Uninterrupted access to medical care and HIV treatment are a necessity for PLWH . In addition to Medicaid, many PLWH also have some portion of their care and treatment needs met through another coverage source . Data from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program shows that in 2016, more than 28,000 ADAP clients nationwide were also Medicaid -eligible at some point of the calendar year as a result of changes in income.26 Given the tendencies for fluctuations in eligibility for the Medicaid population, we encourage the state to ensure that there are no coverage barriers for this population by streamlin ing enrollment, and promote continuous coverage in order to p rotect PLWH from potential disruptions in care and treatment . In a study, PLWH who faced drug benefit design changes were found to be nearly six times more likely to face treatment interruptions than those with more stable coverage, which can increase virologic rebo und, drug resistance, and increased morbidity and mortality.27 Drug benefits for PLWH and other complex medical conditions should be given special consideration within system efforts that may create potential disruptions in access to necessary medications. Broad Coverage of ARTs in Formulary Design We encourage the state to undertake efforts to promote broad coverage of antiretroviral treatment in both state exchange plans, and the Medicaid state formulary in order to promote access and adherence to treatment for PLWH. U ninterrupted access to lifesaving treatments are essential for PLWH to reach viral load suppression and lower transmission rates. The state of Texas - this legislative session - passed a measure that calls for availability of all ARTs in the Medicaid program to treat or prevent HIV . This was signed by the Governor and is one of the strongest efforts ViiV has seen in protecting PLWH.28 The need for broad access to a robust formulary of treatment options for PLWH is critical. Strict adherence to ART treatment regimens is essential to sustained suppression of the virus and 25 Governing.com, \"17,000 Medicaid Patients Are Losing Their Health Care in Georgia\" By Tribune News Service, JUNE 10, 2019, June, 26, 2019 26 2018 Annual Report - National Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Part B & ADAP Monitoring 2018.

Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720-0043 Re: Idaho Department of Insurance Coverage Choice Waiver Application Dear Commissioner Cameron: The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) Idaho appreciates the opportunity to comment on Idaho's Coverage Choice waiver application. ACS CAN is making cancer a top priority for public officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels. ACS CAN empowers advocates across the country to make their voices heard and influence evidence-based public policy change as well as legislative and regulatory solutions that will reduce the cancer burden. As the American Cancer Society's nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy affiliate, ACS CAN is critical to the fight for a world without cancer. Access to health care is paramount for persons with cancer and survivors. An estimated 8,390 Idahoans are expected to be diagnosed with cancer this year.1 For these Idahoans, access to affordable health insurance can be a matter of life or death. Research from the American Cancer Society has shown that uninsured Americans are less likely to get screened for cancer and thus are more likely to have.their cancer diagnosed at an advanced stage when survival is less likely and the cost of care more expensive.' ACS CAN supports a robust marketplace from which consumers can choose a health plan that best meets their needs. We are pleased the Coverage Choice waiver anticipates the state's expansion of its Medicaid program. Medicaid expansion is associated with improved rates of cancer screenings.345 Research has also demonstrated that individuals in expansion states are more frequently diagnosed with cancer at earlier stages than those in non-expansion states,67 likely due to improved access to cancer screenings. Additionally, individuals enrolled in Medicaid prior to their diagnosis have better survival rates than those who enroll after their diagnosis.' 1 American Cancer Society.

American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network Idaho Comments on Coverage Choice Waiver Application June 30, 2019 Page2 Under the Coverage Choice waiver application Idahoans with household incomes between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) would have the choice to enroll in a plan on Idaho's state-based exchange (called Your Health Idaho) and take advantage of federal subsidies9 or to enroll in Idaho's Medicaid program once it is expanded in 2020. Current federal law prohibits individuals who are eligible for expanded Medicaid coverage (which covers individuals up to 138 percent FPL) from receiving subsidies in the exchange. The Coverage Choice waiver application estimates approximately 18,000 Idahoans have incomes between 100-138 percent FPL and thus would be most impacted by the waiver. The waiver does not seek to make other changes to Idaho's state-based exchange. We recognize that some individuals may prefer coverage in the state-based exchange -particularly those individuals who currently are covered through the exchange --and thus would benefit from the proposed waiver. Conversely other individuals may prefer coverage in the Medicaid program - particularly to the extent the Medicaid program covers items and services that are not covered by plans on the exchange. At the same time, offering consumers a choice of coverage options works best if consumers are also provided with non-biased information that is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. Thus, we strongly urge the Department of Insurance -working in collaboration with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare -to develop appropriate materials and commit to undergoing an extensive educational campaign, specifically targeting individuals between 100 and 138 percent FPL to inform them of their choice of coverage, including the relative benefits of each coverage option. Finally, if the state chooses to move forward with its waiver application, we urge the state to recalculate its budget neutrality estimates. Currently the waiver's estimates incorrectly assume that the state is not poised to expand its Medicaid program. We also note that the waiver does not include the statutorily required actuarial analysis necessary to understand cost and coverage implications under the waiver. Such analysis must be conducted prior to the application's submission to CMS. Conclusion We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on Idaho's Coverage Choice waiver application. We stand ready to work with you and other stakeholders to ensure that the proposed waivers are designed in a manner that ensures that consumers have access to the comprehensive coverage that meets their needs, both in the individual market and Medicaid program. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at or avener Government Relations Director Idaho American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network 9 The waiver seeks to allow eligible Idahoans to receive both advance premium tax credits (APTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). From: Janine Wilson Subject: Public Comment on 1332 Waiver Date: Thursday, June 20, 2019 10:28:52 PM I support the approval of the 1332 waiver as indicated in the description. Idaho needs approval of a 1332 waiver to waive federal regulations under 36B of the IRS code so that households between 100 - 138% of FPL remain eligible for the premium tax credit to enroll in a QHP. However, under the waiver, households with income of 100% of FPL or above may still choose to enroll in Medicaid instead of receiving the advance premium tax credit to purchase a QHP. -- Namaste Janine State Relief and Empowerment Waiver application Date: Tuesday, June 18, 2019 5:48:19 PM To Dean Cameron and the Idaho Department of Insurance We are requesting that the Idaho Department of Insurance extend Medicaid benefits only to Idahoan's whose income is between 0% and 100% of the FPL if Medicaid expansion is implemented. We believe offering Medicaid coverage to individuals whose income is above 100% of the FPL would not be prudent and cause multiple unintended consequences, such as: Those that already have a health insurance tax-credit (Advanced Premium Tax-Credit, or APTC) would lose that benefit. This is a Federal -government paid benefit that averages over $5,600 per person per year. Idaho dollars aren't being spent to provide this current assistance. Roughly 22,000 Idahoans would be forced to drop their current health insurance plan, be driven out of the private health insurance market, and into the Medicaid system. Prevent Idahoan's from being able to pick their own doctors outside of the Medicaid network. Take away their freedom to choose from over 30 health insurance options, leaving them only one single option for coverage. Strip from Idahoans the ability to receive help from a local servicing agent, broker, advocate, and advisor, forcing them to deal only with Medicaid employees directly. Take from Idaho's health coverage exchange, \"Your Health Idaho\" and Idaho's insurers over 22,000 participants. Medicaid doesn't require its participants to share in the cost of the care. This leads to higher utilization and poor treatment choices (i.e. like going to the Emergency room for a non-emergency instead of going to an Urgent Care clinic, or scheduling a regular doctor visit). Introducing more demand on Idaho's already limited supply of medical care providers will lead to both longer wait times for procedures, and higher costs being charged per procedure.

For those who already have coverage through Your Health Idaho and receive a tax credit from the Federal Government you are limiting their coverage options by forcing them onto Medicaid. Currently individuals who are between 100% and 138% of FPL are getting great benefits through YHI and using FEDERAL dollars instead of state dollars. Forcing them ontoMedicaid will limit their options for care, prevent them from having an advocate by way of abroker, agent, or advisor and will also lead to higher utilization.

Take from Idaho's health coverage exchange, \"Your Health Idaho\" and Idaho's insurers over 22,000participants. Medicaid doesn't require its participants to share in the cost of the care. This leads to higher utilizationand poor treatment choices (i.e. like going to the Emergency room for a non-emergency instead of going to an Urgent Care clinic, or scheduling a regular doctor visit). Introducing more demand on Idaho's already limited supply of medical care providers will lead to both longer wait times for procedures, and higher costs being charged per procedure. Thank you for your consideration. Brett Thomas Twin Falls, IdahoFrom: Mason Watt To: DOI Reform Subject: Keep Medicaid at 0%-100% FDL Date: Thursday, June 13, 2019 2:51:31 PM To whom it may concern, Greetings. I hope to let my voice be heard by giving some of my input. I am of the opinion that the private healthcare sector is the most effective way to providing the proper balance of satisfaction for the patient, medical providers, and the thousands in our country who are employedby the private insurance industry. Some background on myself, I am a graduate from an Idaho University with a degree in Healthcare Administration. In my course work (some of which was during the November 2018elections) discussed in great detail the expansion of Medicaid in the state of Idaho. One of my professors had done PhD work that hit the subject in great detail. I met with this professor multiple time on our own watch to discuss the pros and cons of the expansion in our state. Through ourdiscussion, I am of the opinion that the human element behind expansion is vital. Providing healthcare access to children and those who are in a position where the FPL is relevant to their lives adds benefits for mental health, career aspiration, graduation rates, and many other useful benefits.However, I feel that the State of Idaho will have sufficient opportunities for those who need the coverage. This is especially true once the coverage gap under 100% FPL is covered. APTC's are a terrific benefit to families who need coverage. I frequently feel that those who are qualifying forCHIP are those who are making a decent income, and are being treated more than fairly. In my experience working with those who qualify for an APTC, they are very grateful to the government programs that help them. They feel that they are able to receive much better coveragethan those who are on Medicaid. I feel the more people who can be kept on APTC's rather than Medicaid, the better. It is better for the insured, much better for providers, obviously the insurance companies and the associated industry, and the tax payers of this state and country. Providing self-independence is a much better route than any type of enabling. PLEASE don't dangle a free carrot for those who are not willing to seek to better themselves. In other words, keep the best reward for those who work the hardest. Thank you for your time. I hope you know how much we all appreciate what you do. Thanks for trying to keep work and jobs in Idaho, as APTC's, private insurance, proficient medical reimbursement for providers, and less heavily taxed workers does.Mason WattFrom: Stephanie Nelson To: DOI Reform Subject: PUBLIC COMMENT - SECTION 1332 STATE RELIEF AND EMPOWERMENT WAIVER APPLICATION Date: Thursday, June 13, 2019 1:52:07 PM My opinion is that Medicaid benefits only to Idahoan's whose income is between 0% and 100% of the FPL if Medicaid expansion is implemented. We believe offering Medicaid coverage to individuals whose income is above 100% of the FPL would not be prudent and cause multiple unintended consequences, such as: Those that already have a health insurance tax-credit (Advanced Premium Tax-Credit, or APTC) would lose that benefit.

It was also explained to me by an employee of the Department of Health & Welfare that anyMedicaid recipient age 55 or older could be subject to Estate Recovery! This is an impendingnightmare if accurate. It is not what Idaho is about - forcing a single choice and takingpeople's estates because we didn't give them a choice! More choice, more freedom.

Most people with 100-138% subsidy pay little or no premium or out of pocket costs. 2. These current Idahoans are purchasing private insurance andproviding Idaho Jobs to health insurance carriers providingbenefits, paying Idaho taxes and to Idaho Health Insurance Agentsthat help them navigate the best coverage for their individualneeds. 3. When Expansion of Medicaid was voted into law by the Idaho Public, this population wasn't expected to be included in movingfrom Private insurance into Medicaid. The expansion was only meant for those in the GAP who dropped below the level of income toreceive a subsidy. This was not intended. 4. If the people want Medicaid, they would have a choice with the Waiver. 5. Most of my clients prefer not to be on Medicaid. They might have to change doctors and doctors are not accepting new patientsfor Medicaid like other insurance plans. Idahoans will not be happy if they are forced onto the government sponsored healthcare From: Pelz, Douglas W. To: DOI Reform Subject: Coverage Choice Waiver Date: Saturday, June 1, 2019 1:07:53 PM Please approved the Section 1332 waiver. I have clients in the 100% - 138% FPL range that have benefited having private YHI (ACA) health insurance, with its very low net premium outlay, very low deductibles, 90/10 Coinsurance, very low OOP limits, and wider access to care providers and services, as well as more timely access, than provided by an already overburdened Medicaid system. The already overburdened Medicaid system is showing its strains by having fewer and fewer providers and services available, time delays, and administrative burdens. Many of my clients that would qualify within the waiver would be loath to lose their fabulous private health insurance. Many of my clients find Medicaid fails to provide services sufficient to reach a point of being better and therefore able to be more productive citizens. Instead, Medicaid seems to provide (when available) just enough services to prevent regression, but not nearly enough to become better in health (a symptom of Medicaid financial strains). Private health insurance provides a broader range of providers and services, and so more timely, andwith a willingness to help my clients not just reach a point of no further regression, but actualimprovements in health sufficient to help them become more productive, tax-paying citizens (positive outcomes for all). Another harder to quantify, but vital point; my clients feel empowered by paying some effort (even if it is minimal premium, minimum CoPay, low CoInsurance, low total OOP). They feel empowered to receive treatments that don't stop at ending regression, but continue to accomplishimprovement in health to make them better able to function as contributing members of society rather than a continual Medicaid burden on society. I have clients in the waiver range that have had their private health insurance improve them so much that they have gone from working part-time minimal earnings to now able to work full-time higher wages and benefits. Years of prior medicaid (if available) did not improve their health while a few years of private health insurance has them substantially healthierand more productive. Their are some folks who will opt-in for the \"free-ride\" but sick Medicaid system, while many eligible folks will choose to keep their private health insurance and their efforts toward it as a very fair value/benefit program. Idahoans tend to desire their independence rather than dependence. The waiver program is consistent with this desire and is economically good for Idaho, Medicaid, and the health care system. Please approve Section 1332 in full.

My income falls within 100% to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. I want to continue to be able to choose a qualified health plan through the Idaho health insurance exchange.

Kate Haas Kestrel West Coverage Choice Waiver Idaho Department of Health and Welfare June 28, 2019 Scott Centorino Visiting Fellow OPPORTUNITY SOLUTIONS PROJECT ... 2 Opportunity Solutions Project (OSP) supports Idaho's efforts to mitigate the risk of Medicaid expansion by allowing individuals with incomes between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to decline Medicaid coverage and continue enrollment in the individual market. The alternative\u2014forcing these individuals onto Medicaid\u2014would substantially increase costs, divert resources away from the most vulnerable, and crowd out funding for other core priorities, including education and public safety. Medicaid expansion has created a budget crisis in other states As Idaho implements its Medicaid expansion, it should prepare for enrollment and costs to exceed expectations. States that have already expanded Medicaid have signed up more than twice as many able-bodied adults as they expected would ever enroll.1 In some states, four times as many able-bodied adults enrolled than expected.2 In other states, more able-bodied adults enrolled than state officials thought would ever even be eligible.3 In California, for example, enrollment exceeded projections by 322 percent.4 Nevada's projections were exceeded by 140 percent.5 Worse yet, per-person costs have exceeded expectations by 76 percent.6 As a result, costs have come in more than 157 percent higher than projected in states that expanded Medicaid.7 Ultimately, this leaves fewer resources for the most vulnerable\u2014including poor children, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. If Idaho forces more able-bodied, working-age adults into Medicaid and out of private insurance\u2014even those who want to maintain their current coverage\u2014the state will accelerate the program's insolvency. In the end, the state will have even fewer resources to help the truly needy. These costs will also crowd out other important investments in Idaho. The more dollars that Idaho spends on Medicaid coverage for individuals who already have private insurance and want to keep it, the less money Idaho has available to spend on other priorities, such as education and public safety. Medicaid expansion will dump able-bodied adults with private coverage into Medicaid Nearly 19,000 able-bodied adults with income between 100 percent and 138 percent FPL currently have private coverage in the individual market.8 Without the proposed waiver, these individuals would be forced out of their current private coverage and into Medicaid expansion.9 This coverage is already heavily subsidized. For example, individuals and families making 100 percent FPL pay only $21 per month for the Silver plan on the Exchange.10 If they were to choose a plan with premiums lower than the benchmark plan, their premiums would drop even further.11 The proposed waiver would allow these individuals to maintain their existing private coverage if they so choose. This proposal will not increase costs to taxpayers, as these individuals are already eligible for subsidies through the Exchange. However, the proposal will offer some protection to taxpayers' other investments from the inevitable encroachment of Medicaid deeper and deeper into Idaho's budget. More work will need to be done Without the proposed waiver, Idaho's Medicaid expansion would force more low-income individuals and families out of their private insurance coverage and into Medicaid. This would not only stretch the program's resources and move its focus away from the most vulnerable, it would raise costs for everyone else. Idaho could expect to see the same budget challenges experienced by every other expansion state. OPPORTUNITY SOLUTIONS PROJECT ... 3 The proposed waiver will not rescue Idaho from all of the inevitable problems of Medicaid expansion. Instead, it will simply mitigate a small portion of the long-term damage. That mitigation is necessary, but more work remains to be done. REFERENCES 1.

All citizens with medical insurance should have a choice no matter what that choice may be. As a Medicare recipient, I am allowed the choice of original or advantage programs. These are very different in what they require as deductibles and at times in providers or provider networks. This is not and has not been a detrimentto my health care.
