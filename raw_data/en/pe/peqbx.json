Vaccines and Clinical Site Requirements The University of Kansas Medical Center requires various immunizations for its students. For a detailed list please visit the [student health forms webpage](/academic-and-student-affairs/departments/student-health-services/forms.html) or speak with Student Health Services. These immunization requirements help promote health and safety and facilitate clinical placement. Many, if not all, clinical sites who partner with the University of Kansas Medical Center require proof of these vaccines for students engaged in training or other programmatic experiences at clinical sites. Not being vaccinated may preclude students from participating in activities, potentially impeding their ability to complete all program requirements for degree completion. Applicants with questions should speak with a representative from the academic program to which they intend to apply. "}
