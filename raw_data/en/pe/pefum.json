Healing & Recovery Herbals and botanicals have been used medicinally for thousands of years. Once thought of as 'traditionals medicine' used by native or ancient cultures, herbal medicine has emerged as a popular complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), or supplement to modern medicine. Dietary supplements include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, enzymes, and other substances that may be 'supplemented', or added to the diet, in order to complete dietary needs or to make up for a nutrition deficiency. These substances are not intended to replace a healthy diet. Dietary supplements may be found in many forms including pills, capsules, powders, drinks, or energy bars. For more information on other forms of dietary supplements. Many consider herbs and botanicals to be natural and therefore healthier and more gentle than conventional drugs, even though 30% of all prescription drugs are of herbal origin. Many use herbs and botanicals for a variety of medical conditions, as well as for overall health and well-being. For othera, herbal use is grounded in traditions passed down from generation to generation or recommended by folk healers.
