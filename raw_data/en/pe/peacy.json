Introduction 1. The reasons for the rapid growth in banks' off-balance-sheet exposures over recent years have been much debated and will not be rehearsed in any depth in this paper.Deregulation and technological progress have provided new opportunities for banks but havealso increased competitive pressures, from banks and non-banks alike. The margins availablefor many types of conventional on-balance-sheet business have been diminishing, whilst at thesame time supervisors have acted to restore and strengthen banks' capital adequacy. Bankshave responded to these and other developments imaginatively and vigorously in an effortboth to retain their traditional customer base and to boost fee income from sources which inmany countries are (so far at least) largely or wholly free from capital requirements.2. The increasing use of financial instruments which do not involve the acquisitionby banks of conventional on-balance-sheet assets raises some difficult questions for individualbank managements, for supervisory authorities and for accountants. It also raises importantmacro-prudential issues concerning the financial system as a whole which are beyond thescope of this paper. While the pace of developments appears quicker in some countries thanothers, banks generally are becoming more deeply involved in an array of novel instrumentsand techniques. Some of these are technically very complicated and are probably only fullyunderstood by a small number of traders and market experts; many pose complex problems inrelation to risk measurement and management control systems; and the implications for theoverall level of risk carried by banks is not easily assessed.3. A prime motivation for some innovations has undoubtedly been the avoidance ofprudential capital requirements, and these are, naturally enough, of particular concern tosupervisors. There is also a more general concern that a number of the instruments examinedin this paper may have the effect of concentrating risks within the banking system as a wholewhich were previously more widely dispersed. This applies particularly to foreign exchangeand interest rate risk. At the same time, it is recognised that, while some banks will haveincreased their risk profiles, other banks, as well as bank customers, now have considerablygreater opportunities to limit and control their overall risk exposures and to reduce their costof borrowing. Some banks - the consumers as opposed to the market-makers in theseinstruments - may thus have managed to reduce their total risk exposure.4. The main conclusion of this paper is that the individual types of risk associatedwith most off-balance-sheet business are in principle no different from those associated withOff-balance-sheet risk 2on-balance-sheet business. It therefore suggests that off-balance-sheet risks cannot and should not be analysed separately from the risks arising from on-balance-sheet business, but shouldbe regarded as an integral part of banks' overall risk profiles. Approaching off-balance-sheetactivities in this way has the additional merit of recognising their value when they serve tohedge risks present within the balance sheet. Supervisors consider it particularly importantthat banks adopt a coordinated approach to risk management and pay special attention to thepossible correlation of different types of risk, both within the individual bank and the bankinggroup as a whole.5. Accounting for off-balance-sheet activities differs significantly from country tocountry. Items may be recorded on the balance sheet, below the line, as notes to the accounts,in supervisory reports, within banks' internal reporting systems or in some cases not at all. Theaccounting issues are not addressed directly in this paper, which focuses on the underlyingrisks (in particular the credit risks) regardless of how the exposure is recorded in nationalaccounting systems. However, many supervisors consider that the information about off-balance-sheet exposures presently supplied in banks' published accounts is generallyinsufficient to give shareholders and depositors a reasonable picture of banks' activities. Thesupervisory authorities in Committee member countries would welcome discussions with theaccounting profession in their own countries on all the issues raised in this paper, which haveimplications for management accounts and information systems as well as published financialaccounts.6. This paper examines off-balance-sheet risks from three angles market/positionrisk, credit risk and operational/control risk. Part II looks at liquidity and market/position riskunder the general headings of liquidity and funding risk, interest rate risk and foreignexchange risk. It also contains a short analysis of the particular risks involved in writing andbuying options. Part III examines credit risk (including control of large exposures, se ttlement risk and country risk), with particular emphasis given to the assessment of the relative risks ofthe different types of off-balance-sheet activity. Part IV considers some of the factors whichbanks need to take into account in setting up adequate management and control systems fortheir off-balance-sheet activities. The last part of the paper (Part V) sets out the Committee' sviews on the role of supervisors in monitoring banks' off-balance-sheet exposures.7. Attached to this paper is a glossary of terms which is an integral part of the paperand should be read in conjunction with it. The glossary has two purposes. First, it is intendedto provide a set of common definitions of individual off-balance-sheet instruments andtechniques as a basis for discussion of the issues, although it is recognised that there are minorand, in some cases, major variants of these instruments in different countries. Secondly, it ishoped that it may serve as a basic framework for supervisory reporting systems (see paragraph52). To this end, the glossary has been designed to facilitate both general and more detailedOff-balance-sheet risk 3reporting and it is hoped that the structure will prove sufficiently flexible and robust to accommodate any new instruments which may be developed. II. Liquidity and market/position risks arising from off-balance-sheet activities Liquidity and funding risk 8. Funding risk may be defined as the risk that a bank will be unable to purchase or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to meet its obligations as they fall due. (Theseobligations might, for example, take the form of maturing deposits or drawings undercommitted facilities.) Funding difficulties may arise when, in order to meet sudden orunusually large withdrawals of funds, a bank is forced to rely on less stable, purchaseddeposits for a greater than normal proportion of its funding requirements. This may strain thewillingness of the market to supply funds at competitive rates and may (perhaps wrongly)convey a signal that the bank is facing serious problems.9. The worldwide total of commitments now outstanding for NIFs, standby letters ofcredit, loan commitments and, where they exist, undrawn overdraft facilities, is very largeindeed. The Committee has concluded that the rapid growth of commitments represents asignificant additional risk to banks' funding strategies. Many commitments are callableentirely at the borrower' s option and many are most likely to be called when other markets (inparticular the capital markets) are reluctant to meet the borrower' s needs. It is thereforepossible that a bank might be faced with large and perhaps unexpected calls undercommitments at a time when markets are unreceptive to its needs for additional funds. To theextent that the growth in commitments represents a structural shift in borrowing patterns, suchthat banks move away from direct lending and increasingly towards a \"back-stop\" function, itmay prove difficult to raise large sums at short notice to meet these commitments.10. With the more traditional commitments, for example overdrafts, there isconsiderable historical experience indicating in aggregate a relatively stable rate of draw-down, which varies between different countries and different banks and will also vary witheconomic conditions. It is too soon to be able to draw any conclusions about the draw-downexperience with some of the newer types of commitment. Moreover, it may be that they willnot produce such a stable pattern because of their very nature.11. For all these reasons, not least the difficulty of estimating draw-down rates), bankswill need to be particularly cautious in their funding management. Banks may wish to assess(and set limits on) their total volume of commitments in terms of their perceived fundingcapacity, perhaps assessing this on a \"worst case\" basis and revising it in line with marketconditions, actual draw-down and developments in borrowers' creditworthiness. It may bethat, wherever possible, banks will seek committed lines for their own use to reduce theirfunding mismatch.Off-balance-sheet risk 412. Aside from funding difficulties and the liquidity of the cash markets there is also a degree of concern about the liquidity of some of the newer markets (for example options,futures, forward rate agreements and swaps). Not all these markets are yet tried and tested andbanks will need to monitor their positions in them very carefully. Interest rate risk 13. Banks conduct a wide variety of activities off the balance sheet which have an impact on their interest rate exposure. Many such activities, for example swaps, options andforward rate agreements, may be entered into as a hedge against on-balance-sheet interest rateexposures, or as banks see arbitrage opportunities open up between cash and futures marketsor between one futures market and another. Swaps in particular will often be provided as aproduct in their own right. Some transactions may be undertaken with the deliberate aim ofincreasing net interest rate exposures. Where a bank acts as a market-maker in theseinstruments, this may lead to an increase in interest rate as well as in credit exposure.14. In principle, it should be possible for banks to incorporate position risks arisingspecifically from off-balance-sheet activities into any system designed to measure overallinterest rate exposure. Banks employ a variety of techniques ranging from simple gap limitsthrough \"milli-month\" systems to \"risk point\" systems of various degrees of complexity. 1 All these approaches make implicit and explicit assumptions which must be constantly reviewedand tested. The degree of complexity and sophistication that is necessary or appropriate for aninterest rate risk measurement and control system will vary between banks. Systems, however,need to be capable of capturing all the interest rate exposures of a bank (whether arising fromtransactions on or off the balance sheet). Banks also need to be able to perform sensitivityanalyses, so that management can estimate the effect of a given change in interest rates. Thosebanks which engage in large volumes of interest rate swap transactions and other significantoff-balance-sheet interest arbitrage will also have to consider how to measure and controlbasis risk (where, for example, the underlying obligations have the same maturity or interestrate roll-over periods, but the reference rates differ). Foreign exchange risk 15. Off-balance-sheet activities have a significant impact on banks foreign exchange exposures in just the same way as they do on interest rate exposures. Forward transactions,swaps, options or futures can either reduce or increase exposure to exchange rate changes. 1In simple terms a risk point represents the amount of gain or loss that would result from a given movement in interest rates. In some cases this is a fixed movement, e.g. 1%, in others a changing estimate of likelymovements is used which is regularly adjusted in the light of recent empirical data. The bank will have anoverall risk point limit which will often be sub-allocated to different profit centres.Off-balance-sheet risk 516. There is already a wide measure of agreement on appropriate methods for assessing and controlling foreign exchange exposure and all major banks operate tried andtested systems for monitoring their foreign exchange exposures. Foreign exchange positionsshould be monitored on a spot-plus-forward basis and any system should pick up all foreignexchange positions, whether arising from business recorded on or off the balance sheet,including in particular futures, swaps and options. Options 17. Options give rise to particular concerns because of their unique risk distribution characteristics and the technical difficulties involved in risk hedging. The distribution of bothmarket and credit risks as between writers and buyers of options is asymmetrical. The buyer ofan option has in theory the possibility of an unlimited profit, but his potential loss is limited tothe amount of premium paid. Conversely, the writer of an option is in principle exposed to thepossibility of unlimited loss if he does not hedge the exposure, while his maximum potentialprofit is limited to the premium income received. This asymmetry is reversed in the case ofcredit risk. The writer of an option has no credit risk once the premium payment has beenreceived since the buyer has no obligations to carry out; the buyer, however, is exposed to thewriter' s ability to perform throughout the life of the option.18. Managing, hedging and pricing options requires considerable statistical andmathematical expertise (unless options written are hedged through the purchase of identicaloptions, i.e. with the same exercise price, face value and expiry date). Rigorous limit andcontrol systems are necessary, covering, inter alia, controls on concentrations of strike priceand settlement dates as well as the full range of controls employed in conventional trading. Aswith any dealing activity bank managements need a formal written policy for authorising theactivities of their traders. American options (where the buyer can choose when to exercise theoption) pose particular problems for the control of settlement risk and special agreements withcounterparties will often be necessary to limit this risk. However, even with a well-developedset of limits and controls, a bank' s risk assessment system will only be as good as themathematical model and the raw data it is using - the estimate of volatility in particular iscrucial. The more experienced banks are well aware of the risks involved in trading optionsand those banks which write options, even on a modest scale, should ensure that they havestaff who are competent in the techniques necessary to manage the risks and who are able tomake the difficult judgements required. In view of the potentially sizeable losses, banks whichare not confident that they have a sound grasp of the risks involved in options trading and thattheir monitoring systems are adequate are advised not to write options.Off-balance-sheet risk 6III. The assessment of credit risk in respect of off-balance-sheet activities 19. Credit risk has traditionally been considered to be the most important risk for a commercial bank and poor asset quality has probably been the cause of more bank failuresthan any of the exposures discussed above. As well as the degree of risk involved in particulartypes of transaction, the assessment of credit risk involves considering the total size ofexposure to any given counterparty or group of connected counterparties, settlement risk andpotential country risk and cross-border problems (these latter three aspects are addressedbriefly at the end of this section).20. This section of the paper reviews the credit risks involved in different types of off-balance-sheet activity (i.e. the risk that one or more counterparties will fail to perform). TheCommittee felt that it would be helpful to set out what its members generally agree to be therelative degrees of credit risk arising from the different types of business. Given the newnessof some instruments and the institutional and accounting differences, it is inevitable that at themargin there may be legitimate differences of view about the relative risk of each item. Thetranslation of these relative degrees of risk into management tools and supervisory riskassessment measures poses considerable theoretical, practical and, in some cases, legalproblems. Although these issues cannot be avoided in the long run, it is not the intention ofthe present paper to prescribe risk weightings for different instruments. It would therefore bepremature for the Committee to attempt to translate the relative risk assessments given belowinto particular numbers in the context of any national supervisory system. However, it isnonetheless hoped that supervisors will be able to achieve a broadly consistent approach.21. The analysis which follows seeks to classify the relative degrees of credit riskarising from different off-balance-sheet activities according to three categories of risk. Itshould be stressed that these judgements are made in the light of present knowledge and maywell need to be revised as a result of experience. \"Full risk\" where the instrument is a direct credit substitute and the credit risk is equivalent to that of an on-balance-sheet exposure to the same counterparty; \"Medium risk\" where there is a significant credit risk but mitigating circumstances which suggest less than full credit risk; \"Low risk\" where there is a small credit risk but not one which can be ignored. 22. In addressing credit risk, the Committee found it helpful to draw up a broadframework of analysis which distinguishes between four different categories of off-balance-sheet activity, namely guarantees and similar contingent liabilities, commitments, market-related transactions and advisory, management and underwriting functions. The glossary setsout the distinctions between each category. In particular, it attempts to explain the differentnature of a contingent liability, where a bank has underwritten the current obligations of aOff-balance-sheet risk 7third party, and of a commitment, where a bank has no immediate credit exposure but may well become exposed at a future date. In drawing up this structure, the Committee recognisesthat some of the newer instruments - notably NIFs - have challenged the distinctiontraditionally drawn between contingents and commitments. It is also appreciated that it maysometimes be difficult in practice to make the distinctions discussed in this paper.Nevertheless, the categorisation was found to be a useful structure for analysis and it is hopedthat it will prove sufficiently flexible and robust to deal with further innovations. (i) Guarantees and similar contingent liabilities 23. Guarantees and acceptances (which in some countries are reported on the balance sheet) are obligations to stand behind a third party. As such, they are regarded as direct creditsubstitutes, and the credit risk is equivalent to that of a loan to the ultimate borrower or to thedrawer of the instrument in the case of an acceptance (full risk).24. Transactions with recourse , in respect of which a bank retains the credit risk on assets sold to a third party, have recently become more significant as banks have come underpressure to achieve stronger capital ratios and, as one consequence, have sought to removeassets from the balance sheet. Where the vendor retains the credit risk, this is considered tofall within the full risk category - indeed in some countries assets sold with recourse have tobe reported in the selling bank' s balance sheet.25. Banks in North America, particularly, have very large off-balance-sheet exposuresin the form of standby letters of credit . Such instruments can perform a number of different functions, the most common of which are listed in the glossary. These functions take eitherthe form of guarantees, where for example a less than first-class borrower uses a bank' s nameto issue commercial paper on first-class terms, or the form of warranties, indemnities andperformance bonds (see paragraph 27 below). There is a case, therefore, for distinguishingbetween such instruments, in terms of their function, and regarding those with the character ofguarantees as bearing full credit risk and those with the character of warranties, indemnitiesand performance bonds as bearing medium credit risk.26. The main difficulty with documentary letters of credit (commercial letters of credit in the United States) lies in deciding what allowance, if any, to make for the generallyshort maturity of these exposures and for the collateral which usually supports them (this takesthe form of title to the goods being shipped, but will rarely enable the bank to recover morethan a proportion of its losses, given that a sale of the underlying goods may be distress innature). While the credit risk is in principle equivalent to that of a commercial loan, the shortmaturity, the partial protection afforded by collateral and the relatively favourable historic lossrecord suggest that such transactions bear a medium risk in practice. However, some membersof the Committee are of the view that these exposures represent a full risk. Where a bank hasOff-balance-sheet risk 8confirmed a documentary credit issued by another bank, the credit risk represents an exposure to another bank.27. Warranties , indemnities and performance bonds are in principle much the same as guarantees in that the credit risk hinges on the ability of a third party (the bank' s customer) tomeet its obligations, but they are generally not direct credit substitutes. 2 They do not support an existing financial obligation, but rather the ability of a customer to meet his routinebusiness obligations, and they are sometimes related to specific contracts. Such activities,taken in aggregate, do not appear to have involved banks in significant losses, and mighttherefore be regarded as bearing a medium risk. In one or two countries, however, banks havesuffered losses from performance bonds and their supervisors may consider that the risk is afull one.28. The term \" endorsement \" has a different meaning in different markets, so it is necessary for banks to distinguish the essence of the transactions. A clean \"per aval\"endorsement, for example, is very similar to an acceptance and as such carries full credit risk.Where, on the other hand, a bill has already been accepted by another bank - and there mayalso be other banks' names on it - the credit risk may be regarded as low, although notnegligible, and is essentially a bank risk. (ii) Commitments 29. Here it is helpful to attempt a distinction between those commitments which are in practice binding on a bank in all circumstances (\" irrevocable commitments \") and those from which a bank could withdraw without penalty - notably in the event of a deterioration in thecredit quality of the potential borrower (\" revocable commitments \"), although it is recognised that this distinction may be difficult to operate in practice in some circumstances. In drawingthe boundary between revocable and irrevocable commitments, it is probably imprudent toplace too much reliance on material adverse change clauses and other similar protectivedevices - they have mostly not been put to the test and may well prove to offer little protectionfrom a deteriorating credit risk in practice. (a) Irrevocable commitments 30. In principle these can be divided into two distinct categories: irrevocable commitments with certain exercise or draw-down (but not necessarily a certain date of draw-down), where it is known in advance that the commitmentwill definitely be taken up in full; here the bank is effectively exposed to fullcredit risk; 2However, some warranties and indemnities have the character of guarantees and should be treated as credit substitutes (full risk).Off-balance-sheet risk 9irrevocable commitments with uncertain draw-down, where draw-down is entirely at the discretion of the other party and it is unclear both whether and to whatextent the credit exposure will actually materialise; in such cases, the probabilityand likely timing of any draw-down as well as the likely quality of the asset at thetime of draw-down need to be taken into account. Some types of irrevocable commitments are available with certain or uncertain draw-down.31. Asset sale and repurchase agreements (\"repos\") are very frequent arrangements in some countries, mainly for treasury management purposes, and are becoming more commonin others, as lending becomes increasingly \"securitised\". Where the asset in question is certainto come back to the selling bank at some predetermined date, the credit risk on the asset soldremains essentially with the selling bank (i.e. a full risk). An additional credit risk arises fromthe possibility of the failure of the counterparty to the repo, often a specialised security dealer.The potential size of this latter exposure will depend inter alia on the type of security\"repoed\", the arrangements for margin and interest payments, the maturity of the repo andmovements in market prices. The exposure here is the net cost of replacing the particular asset\"repoed\" should the counterparty default. The principles of replacement cost risk are outlinedin paragraph 37 below. Outright forward purchases are much less common than repos, but the credit risk is in principle the same (i.e. a full risk). It is not considered prudent to offsetforward sales against forward purchases in assessing credit risk unless the transactions arewith the same party, and even here there may be legal issues to be considered.32. Forward forward deposits at predetermined interest rates are becoming less common as banks are using forward rate agreements instead. The bank which has contractedto place the deposit is fully exposed to credit risk vis- \u00e0-vis the counterparty. For the bank which has contracted to receive the deposit, failure to deliver by the counterparty will result inan unanticipated change in a bank's interest rate exposure (as well as a funding problem) andmay involve a replacement cost. Its exposure should therefore be accorded the same treatmentas interest rate related transactions (see section (iii) below).33. Partly-paid shares and securities payable in predetermined instalments are not commonly encountered in most countries, but in the United Kingdom Government securitiesare sometimes issued in partly-paid form with fixed payment instalments laid down at thetime of issue and this technique is used from time to time in the Euro-bond market. Sincedraw-down is certain, commitments of this nature bear full credit risk. In the recent past,floating rate notes have been issued in partly-paid form with further calls at the discretion ofthe issuer and it is possible that use of such instruments may increase. Since in this latter caseit is not known whether and when such calls may be made, commitments of this nature bearan indeterminate credit risk of similar nature to NIFs and RUFs (see paragraph 35 below).Off-balance-sheet risk 1034. Unconditional standby facilities and other similar commitments to lend involve a credit risk but the size of the ultimate exposure may vary while the quality of the exposurewill depend on the circumstances in which the facility is likely to be drawn. The credit risk forthe bank may be regarded as medium if there is a reasonable probability that only a part of thecommitment will ever be drawn.35. A similar kind of risk arises in the underwriting of NIFs and RUFs . Here, credit exposure for the underwriter materialises when the market will no longer purchase or acceptan issuer 's paper within an agreed price range. However, the risk is significantly higher than with conventional underwriting since the commitment customarily supports continuous short-term issues over an extended period of years. Moreover, if drawn upon, the bank is likely tobe required to take on a credit risk which has already been turned down by others. In somecountries, such commitments are regarded as the equivalent of guarantees. There is a balanceto be struck between the possibility that only a relatively small proportion of the aggregatecommitments may be drawn, and the likelihood that any assets acquired under such commitments may well be sub-standard, having already been turned down by others. Inpresent circumstances, the credit risk would appear to be at least of a medium nature, butsince experience with these instruments is still limited this assessment will need to bereviewed in the light of market developments. As an additional control on these exposures,banks might wish to set an overall limit on the total of such commitments which they areprepared to accept. (b) Revocable commitments 36. Items such as credit lines and undrawn overdrafts are not binding obligations on the banks and, since the bank retains absolute discretion to withdraw the commitment in theevent of a credit deterioration, there is no immediate credit risk. However, if banks are to beable to take full advantage of this discretion, they will need to have efficient systems tomonitor the evolving creditworthiness of their counterparties. (iii) Foreign exchange, interest rate and stock index related transactions 37. In these transactions the bank is not exposed on the whole of the underlying principal of the transaction except when settlement becomes due for those transactionsinvolving an exchange of principal. In the case of counterparty failure the bank is left with anunexpected or unintended foreign exchange or interest rate position which it can in theoryclose out at a cost (or a profit) with another counterparty. The credit exposure can bemeasured as the cost of replacing (\"replacement cost\") the stream of cash flows at currentmarket rates. The problem is that this cost will fluctuate depending, inter alia, on the maturityof the contract outstanding and the actual level of interest rates and exchange rates at any time.This presents a new type of risk measurement problem. Whereas with conventional on-Off-balance-sheet risk 11balance-sheet exposures the maximum size of a potential loss is relatively simple to calculate (principal plus overdue interest), for these instruments it is not possible to forecast thepotential loss with any degree of accuracy.38. Nonetheless, bankers need to estimate the potential credit exposure arising fromthese transactions in order to comply with credit limit constraints and to be able to price thedeal correctly. Current best practice is to estimate the maximum likely replacement cost on acautious basis using data on past (and projected future) interest rate and foreign exchange ratevolatility. The most active banks are already doing this. Banks are advised to build a cautiousbias into their estimates and to revalue their portfolio of such instruments regularly to ensurethat they are not underestimating counterparty credit exposure.39. Where these instruments are used as a hedging mechanism (either to hedge otherswaps, for example, or a range of market position risk exposures deriving from either on- oroff-balance-sheet items), a bank will only be exposed if one counterparty to the hedgedefaults. In the unlikely event of both counterparties defaulting simultaneously the bankwould notionally have a flat position (although much depends on how a swap claim by oragainst a liquidator or receiver would be handled and there is at present insufficientexperience of this). In considering the gross volume of a bank 's swap book on a portfolio basis, this will need to be taken into account, along with any legally-enforceable nettingarrangements banks may have with particular counterparties. Where banks follow the cautiousapproach outlined here, the resulting total of replacement cost exposures may be regarded assubject to medium credit risk.40. Where banks trade in options, futures or other similar contracts throughexchanges, the credit risk may be felt to be lower both because of the margining requirementsof the exchanges and (for clearing members) the fact that contracts are held directly with theexchange. However, the credit risk should not be regarded as negligible. (iv) Advisory, management and underwriting functions 41. Banks engage in a range of fiduciary and agency functions which involve them in possible claims for negligence or breach of fiduciary obligations. Such activities cannot beregarded as involving a credit risk as such, but rather form part of the operational and controlrisks (see Section IV below) where a bank 's reputation and standing may be at stake. 42. Securities underwriting poses a particular problem because, although the exposureis often very short-term, it can be very large in relation to the underwriter 's capital base. The risk is essentially one of misjudgement of market price, where the underwriter suffers a loss inplacing the paper, rather than that of the outright failure of a company whose prospectus hasjust been prepared. Nonetheless, given the size of issues underwritten, losses from mispricingcan be substantial. While it may be reasonable at present to regard underwriting as one of theactivities which come under the general heading of operational and market price risk ratherOff-balance-sheet risk 12than as a readily quantifiable credit risk, if securitisation of conventional balance-sheet lending continues to grow, credit risk may become a more significant factor in suchunderwriting. In addition, under the laws of some countries, an underwriter may be liable forfailure adequately to ascertain and disclose to investors material information pertaining to theissuing company or the securities being issued. If there is any default by the issuing companyor decline in the market price of the securities as a result of adverse financial results within ashort time after the underwriting, investors are likely to seek to hold the bank underwriterliable. Control of large exposures 43. In most countries banks are subject to guidelines or limits on \"large exposures\" and, even where there are no specific limits, banks are still expected to diversify their risk in aprudent manner. The present scale of off-balance-sheet activities is such that banks can veryeasily become excessively exposed to a single counterparty (or associated group ofcounterparties), perhaps without realising it. Off-balance-sheet exposures should be includedin a systematic manner in banks ' internal counterparty limits. A cautious approach to counterparty exposure measurement is appropriate since the objective is to limit the impactthat the failure of a single customer might have on a bank 's solvency. Thus it is considered that both contingent liabilities and commitments, whether revocable or not, should beincluded on a gross basis within counterparty limits, since in all cases they represent levels upto which the bank is currently prepared to commit itself. For foreign exchange, interest rateand stock index related transactions, an estimate for the \"replacement cost\" of an exposure (see paragraph 38) should also be included. It is difficult to take account in a systematicmanner of counterparty exposures in respect of securities underwriting, but it is suggested thatbanks should decide on a maximum figure beyond which they will not commit themselves. Settlement risk 44. In many cases a bank will pay away funds, foreign exchange or securities before it can be certain that it will receive the proceeds due to it under the deal being settled(particularly - but not only - when an operation is being conducted in two different timezones). Limits designed to capture and control settlement exposure should encompass thesettlement risk arising from off-balance-sheet business. Country risk 45. Country risk is another aspect of banking risk within which off-balance-sheet exposures need to be considered. A paper by the Committee on this issue, which was givenwide circulation in 1982, referred explicitly to the need for banks to identify their trueexposure with regard to off-balance-sheet activities. A comprehensive country risk monitoringOff-balance-sheet risk 13system should clearly encompass contingent liabilities, irrevocable commitments and certain market activities such as swaps and foreign exchange positions. IV. Banks' management and control of their off-balance-sheet exposures 46. Whatever operations they undertake, banks run the risk of losses arising from any failure to apply adequate control systems. This is taken to include the principles of dualcontrol, separation of function and sanctioning of exposure limits as well as the more generalaspects of audit, risk control and management information systems. Without effective centralrisk control systems, senior managements of banks will have no sound basis for monitoring,controlling or planning the different types of exposure reviewed in this paper; and withoutaccounting systems which enable independent checking and reconciliation procedures to becarried out on a routine basis, the detection of potential losses will be very difficult and therisk of fraud will increase.47. These considerations apply to the whole of a bank 's business, but off-balance- sheet activities raise particular difficulties in view of the complexity of many of theinstruments. Moreover, the absence of the discipline (in accounting terms) imposed by abalance-sheet asset gives rise to the risk that bank managements may not retain sufficientcontrol over the exposures and that auditors will not pay enough attention to the activitiesinvolved. The highly competitive environment and the speed with which many innovationsare introduced also pose problems for control systems and banks should ensure that theirtraders do not engage in innovative transactions before limits and proper control systems arein place. Indeed, bank boards need formal written policies to govern all trading activities.While the ability to make quick decisions is undoubtedly a key factor in the currentenvironment, banks may need to re-examine the structure of their risk assessment andaccounting systems, as well as current management procedures, in order to ensure thatdecisions are taken with an informed appreciation of the risks.48. The risk from inadequate control is bound to grow as the markets becomeincreasingly complex. Systems should ensure that all facilities, whatever their nature, areproperly sanctioned within limits agreed at a senior level, that all actual or potential exposuresare capable of being independently verified, that exposures to individual counterparties areconsidered in aggregate and regularly reviewed, and that other aspects of risk exposure (e.g. tosectors, countries, particular markets, and to foreign exchange and interest rate movements)are centrally monitored. In those cases where credit exposures vary in line with foreignexchange and interest rate movements (see section (iii) above), it will also be necessary torevalue the exposure regularly to establish whether actual exposures remain within the limitsused for credit sanctioning purposes. Since some of the innovations, particularly options, arecrucially dependent on computer systems, banks need to have access to adequate backupfacilities in the event of computer breakdown. Both internal and external audits shouldOff-balance-sheet risk 14encompass the monitoring of system adequacy including the technical competence of the personnel involved, as well as considering the actual risk exposure figures at particular pointsof time.49. It is not sufficient, however, to concentrate on the specific risks of individualinstruments. Central coordination and control of the totality of the risk involved in trading in avariety of different instruments is also important because of the linkages between them. Thisis no easy task. Since it is obviously more difficult for banking groups with extensivedecentralised branch networks and extended corporate structures to coordinate their operationsthan for single compact units, attention also has to be paid to the need for high standards ofgroup control and for a worldwide consolidated approach to the supervision of risks, both onand off the balance sheet. V. The role of the supervisor in monitoring off-balance-sheet exposures 50. The particular perspective of supervisory authorities in relation to off-balance- sheet risk is to seek to ensure that banks are adopting appropriate procedures to measure andcontrol the risks. The Committee sees three main elements in the development of supervisoryapproaches to off-balance-sheet risk.51. The first element is for supervisors to keep abreast of new developments byengaging in dialogue with banks and other interested parties. An earlier version of the glossaryattached to this report has already been used by some supervisory authorities, both within theGroup of Ten and outside, in bilateral discussions with banks.52. The second element is to review prudential reporting systems to ensure that allmajor off-balance-sheet activities are adequately captured in supervisory returns. Existingreporting systems in most countries do not at present capture with sufficient precision therange of different off-balance-sheet engagements. One purpose of the glossary of termsattached, which is divided into different categories of risk, is to facilitate drawing up reportingdefinitions and to provide a common framework within which different countries mayintroduce the degree of detailed reporting they require. The glossary has deliberately beenstructured to cater both for a relatively simple approach - in which different instruments andtechniques would be captured under broad headings encompassing essentially the same risk -and also a more complex approach - which would permit more detailed reporting within thebroadly defined categories of risk. The intention is that new techniques should be capable ofbeing captured within supervisory reporting systems with the minimum difficulty and delay.Whatever degree of detail is deemed necessary in different countries, supervisory authoritiesin the Group of Ten intend to review their existing systems of reporting as a matter of urgencyto ensure that they adequately capture the full range of different off-balance-sheet activities inwhich banks are involved.Off-balance-sheet risk 1553. The third element is to review supervisory policies to ensure that they take full account of developments in off-balance-sheet business. The analysis set out in this paper givesan indication of supervisory thinking at this stage. At national level, supervisors are givingparticular consideration to the modifications which may be needed to their measurement ofcapital adequacy in respect of some of the most significant off-balance-sheet activities,perhaps weighted according to the degree of perceived risk. They will endeavour to ensurethat any measures they introduce are sufficiently flexible and robust to be able to incorporatenew instruments which may subsequently be devised. It is recognised, however, that it will notbe possible to construct a supervisory approach which is wholly comprehensive and thatsupervisors will have to continue to make qualitative judgements about some of the activitiesin which banks engage.Off-balance-sheet risk 16Appendix Glossary of terms I. Guarantees and similar contingent liabilities These are the more traditional off-balance-sheet exposures, where a bank has underwritten the obligations of a third party and currently stands behind the risk. Default by a counterparty on whose behalf a guarantee has been written may trigger an immediate loss, or,more usually, will result in the bank acquiring a sub-standard claim. Many of these items aredirect credit substitutes. Examples (and definitions) of the more typical types of exposurefalling under this heading are given below. 1. Guarantee An undertaking by a bank (the guarantor) to stand behind the current obligations of a third party and to carry out these obligations should the third party failto do so, e.g. a loan guarantee under which A makes a loan to B against a guarantee of repayment provided by bank C. 2. Acceptances An obligation by a bank to pay on maturity the face value of a bill of exchange, normally covering the sale of goods. 3. Transactions with recourse An arrangement whereby a bank sells a loan or other asset to a third party, but retains an obligation to assume the credit risk if the borrowerdefaults or the value of the asset otherwise deteriorates. Typically, these involve the saleof assets previously owned by the bank (\" asset sales with recourse \"). They may also take the form of \" put options \", where the holder of the asset is entitled to \"put\" the asset back to the bank if, for example, the credit quality deteriorates. 4. Standby letters of credit An obligation on the part of the bank to a designated beneficiary to perform or provide compensation under the terms of the underlyingcontracts to which they refer, should the bank 's customers fail to do so. The underlying contracts may involve either financial or non-financial undertakings, e.g. the customer 's payment of commercial paper, delivery of merchandise or completion of a constructioncontract. The range of obligations encompassed under this heading can be very wide,from a conventional guarantee to a commitment to take up commercial paper. If thecustomer fails, the bank may have a preferential claim on its assets. 5. Documentary letters of credit A letter of credit guaranteeing payment by the issuing or opening bank in favour of an exporter against presentation of shipping and otherdocuments. When issued by an importer 's bank it may be \"confirmed\" by an exporter 's bank. Confirmation provides an additional guarantee of payment. These instruments aremore familiarly known as commercial letters of credit in the United States.Off-balance-sheet risk 176. Warranties and indemnities A counter-guarantee provided by a bank that a customer will pay compensation if goods or services (including financial contracts) provided to athird party do not meet the terms specified in a contract, e.g. performance bonds . Also, any general guarantee that a customer will make payment to a third party in specificcircumstances, e.g. customs and tax bonds . 7. Endorsements A guarantee (or warranty) to pay, on maturity, the face value of a bill of exchange (e.g. by endorsing it \"per aval\"). Certain types of endorsement used in somecountries are effectively acceptances. It has, however, become routine in manycountries, when a bill is discounted in the market, for a seller to add his endorsement. Inthe event of a default by the other parties (drawer, acceptor and previous endorsers, ifany), the endorser as a previous holder may be called upon to make payment on the bill. II. Commitments Here a bank has committed itself to a future transaction that will normally result in the bank acquiring a credit exposure (either an asset or possibly a guarantee) at some futuredate. In some cases the commitment is binding on both parties and there may be apredetermined date on which it must be exercised. In other cases the commitment is bindingon the bank alone and the other counterparty may choose whether or when to ask the bank tofulfil its commitment. Under some such commitments the bank will only be called upon toadvance funds or provide a guarantee in circumstances where other parties have refused to doso (e.g. Revolving Underwriting Facilities). Finally, there are the looser commitments where abank has agreed a line of credit or an overdraft facility, but has the right to withdraw thefacility in certain circumstances (in particular where there has been a deterioration in thecredit quality of the potential borrower). (The borderline between the various types of commitment, particularly those which are in practice irrevocable, i.e. unconditional and binding in all circumstances, and those which may be revoked by a bank, may be unclear. Nonetheless, it is a distinction whichthe Committee found helpful in its deliberations.) Irrevocable commitments 1. Asset sale and repurchase agreements An arrangement whereby a bank sells a loan, security or fixed asset to a third party with a commitment to repurchase the asset after acertain time, or in the event of a certain contingency. 2. Outright forward purchases A commitment to purchase a loan, security or other asset at a specified future date, usually on prearranged terms. 3. Forward forward deposits An agreement between two parties whereby one will pay and the other receive an agreed rate of interest on a deposit to be placed by one party withthe other at some predetermined date in the future. Such deposits are distinct fromOff-balance-sheet risk 18forward rate agreements (see III.5. below) in that with forward forwards the deposit is actually placed. 4. Partly-paid shares and securities Where only a part of the issue price or nominal face value of a security purchased has been subscribed and the issuer may call for theoutstanding balance (or a further instalment), either on a date predetermined at the timeof issue, or at an unspecified future date. 5. Standby facilities An unconditional commitment to lend when the borrower makes a request under the facility. This includes bank standby facilities and (in the US) irrevocable revolving lines of credit . 6. Note Issuance Facilities (NIFs) and Revolving Underwriting Facilities (RUFs). An arrangement whereby a borrower may draw down funds up to a prescribed limit over anextended period by repeated issues to the market of, for example, three or six-monthpromissory notes. If at any time the notes cannot be placed in the market at a minimumprice, a group of underwriters undertakes to buy them at a prescribed price. Thecontingent risk to banks arises from their role as underwriters of such issues. There aremany variants of RUFs including Transferable RUFs (TRUFs) and Multiple Component Facilities under which the borrower may draw funds in a variety of ways (including Euro-notes, short-term advances and bankers ' acceptances). A Roly-Poly CD facility involves the issue of CDs on a similar basis to NIFs. Revocable commitments 1. Credit lines An uncommitted facility line opened up by one bank in favour of another bank or customer. In some centres such lines are usually unadvised. 2. Undrawn Overdraft Facilities Reviewable borrowing facilities under which funds borrowed are technically repayable on demand. III. Foreign exchange, interest rate and stock index related transactions These items are essentially interest rate, foreign exchange rate or stock-index agreements, in most cases binding on both parties but in some cases exercisable at one party 's discretion (e.g. options). With the exception of currency swaps, no exchange of principal isgenerally involved. Where the transaction is unhedged, the bank is exposed to movements ininterest rates, exchange rates or stock indices. Whether the transaction is unhedged (i.e.designed deliberately to open up an exposure) or hedged (to neutralise a position exposure),the bank is vulnerable to the creditworthiness of the counterparty (the ability to carry out itsside of the contract) and will be exposed to an unexpected or unintended exposure should thecounterparty default. This exposure can in theory be measured in terms of the cost of replacingthe stream of cash flows lost as a result of counterparty default.Off-balance-sheet risk 191. Forward foreign exchange transactions A contract to pay and receive specified amounts of one currency for another at a future date at a predetermined exchange rate. Default byone party prior to maturity exposes the other to an exchange risk. 2. Currency and interest rate swaps In a currency swap two parties contract to exchange the cash flows - of equal net present value - of specific assets or liabilities which areexpressed in different currencies. In the classic (widely known as \"plain vanilla\")interest rate swap two parties contract to exchange interest service payments (and sometimes principal service payments) on the same amount of indebtedness of the samematurity and with the same payment dates one providing fixed interest rate payments inreturn for variable rate payments from the other and vice versa. \"Basis swaps\" (floatingrate swaps based on different indices, e.g. prime against LIBOR) and combined interestrate and currency swaps (\"circus swaps\") are also common and there are numerousvariations resulting in highly complex swap transactions involving many counterparties.Banks frequently act as intermediaries between participants in these transactions andeither guarantee each principal against the default of the other or themselves act asprincipals between the two parties, entering into matched transactions with each. Insome cases banks may wish to transform the currency or interest rate structure of theirown book by entering into a swap transaction without a second offsetting transactionwith another party. The risks to banks arise from taking on positions by entering intosuch swaps and from the possibility that default by a counterparty will open upunexpected or unanticipated foreign exchange or interest rate exposures during the lifeof the swap. 3. Currency futures These are exchange-traded contracts for the delivery of a standardised amount of foreign currency at some future date. The price for the foreign currency isagreed on the day the contract is bought or sold. As with forward contracts, gains orlosses are incurred as a result of subsequent currency fluctuations. Unlike forwardmarkets, however, futures contracts are tradable reflecting the standardisation ofcontract size, specification and delivery date. Exchanges require daily marking-to-market for gains and losses. 4. Currency options An option contract allows the holder to exchange (or equally to choose not to exchange) a specific amount of one currency for another at apredetermined rate during some period in the future. For the institution writing theoption the risk lies in its exposure to movements in the exchange rate between the twocurrencies (a market risk). For a bank buying an option the risk lies in the ability of thecounterparty to perform (a credit risk). Options may be contracted \"over-the-counter\"(i.e. directly between counterparties) or via recognised exchanges. The latter havestandardised terms and delivery dates and are tradable.Off-balance-sheet risk 205. Forward rate agreements An agreement between two parties which is similar to a forward forward deposit except that on maturity no deposit is placed by the one partywith the other, but instead a cash settlement is made for the difference between thecontracted rate of interest and the current market rate. 6. Interest rate futures Similar to currency futures, except that the contracts are for delivery of a standardised amount of a specified security, normally Treasury bills, governmentbonds or bank CDs. Gains or losses are incurred as a result of subsequent changes in interest rates. 7. Interest rate options Similar to currency options. The buyer of the option has the right (but not the obligation) to lock into a predetermined interest rate during some period inthe future (typically LIBOR or the price of a US Treasury security). As with currencyoptions the instrument may either be traded \"over-the-counter\" or exchange traded (inthe latter case they are expressed either as an option on a security or on a futurescontract). The buyer of an interest rate option is exposed to the ability of thecounterparty to perform. The writer is exposed to interest rate movements. Some interestrate options are sold as a package with capital market instruments, e.g. capped FRNs(where there is an absolute upper limit on the interest rate payable on the FRN). Interest rate guarantees (IRGs) (also known as interest rate capping agreements ) are also a form of interest rate option. In these arrangements an institution, for a fee, guaranteesthe interest rates on a loan which can be made by another institution. A \"collar\" issimilar to a \"cap\", except that the interest rate is subject to a floor as well as a ceiling.IRGs can also be sold quite independently of any underlying loan and can be writteneither as a lender 's or as a borrower 's guarantee. 8. Stock index futures Similar to currency and interest rate futures, except that the basis for the contract is a stock index (e.g. Standard & Poor 's or Financial Times). Gains or losses are incurred as a result of movements in the index. 9. Stock index options Similar to currency and interest rate options, except that stock index options are generally exchange-traded instruments, although in principle there may beno reason why they should not be contracted \"over-the-counter\". The option gives thebuyer the right to take a cash profit on movements in a specified stock index or topurchase or sell a stock index future (futures option). IV. Advisory, management and underwriting functions 1. Fiduciary services, e.g. trust funds, portfolio management Assets legally the property of customers and other parties but managed by a bank, sometimes on the basis of discretionin the choice of investments. If losses occur due to the bank 's negligence or malpractice, the bank may be legally obliged to reimburse customers or may feel obliged to do so inorder to protect its reputation.Off-balance-sheet risk 212. Agency functions A bank, for a fee, acts as agent for one of its customers. For example, a borrower under a syndicated credit or capital market instrument will typically appointan agent to administer the loan. The bank will be legally liable if losses occur due to itsnegligence. 3. Counter trade (or bartertrade) Two or more parties agree to exchange goods or merchandise, with a bank acting as an intermediary. The bank will be liable in the caseof incompetence. It may also have a more direct exposure if it has provided guarantees(often secured on the underlying goods) to any counterparty. 4. Safe-keeping of securities A bank, for a fee, undertakes to hold and to service stocks, bonds or money-market instruments. The bank will be liable for negligence, forexample, if it fails to collect due dividend or interest payments and to present theinstrument at maturity. 5. Securities underwriting The underwriter undertakes to take up the whole or a pre-agreed part of a capital market issue at a predetermined price. The major risk is that theunderwriter will be unable to place the paper at the issue price or better because of anunfavourable movement in prices resulting from changes in interest rates, an unforeseenpolitical or economic event, a misjudgement of the market price or (less likely) a suddendeterioration in the perceived credit quality of the issuer or the issuer 's country of origin. The exposure is often very large relative to the size of the underwriting bank but(provided none of the events outlined above occurs) generally very short term.Off-balance-sheet risk 22 "}
