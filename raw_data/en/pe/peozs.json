Practical Ayurveda shows how Ayurveda, the traditional natural healing system of India, can correct ordinary ailments with changes in diet and exercise. Atreya writes with humor and compassion, and uses everyday language to explain why Ayurveda (with an emphasis on Prana) is the best overall method to promote health and long life. He clarifies the spiritual principles behind Ayurveda, and provides a broader and more flexible perspective on this ancient healing system than is usually given. He discusses the advantages of using a constitutional system of medicine whereby you are diagnosed and treated as an individual instead of being considered just an ailing patient. A constitutional test is included for determining your own ayurvedic humors. Atreya also gives a straightforward approach to the health benefits of good sexual relationships. Some ayurvedic teachers promote abstinence; however, Atreya shows that our mental attitude towards sex is more important than abstinence. He presents important insights for both women and men, so that we can, regardless of our sexual orientation, maintain a healthy balance. This is an excellent reference guide that includes special diets and cures for dozens of ailments. About the Author: Atreya was born in Southern Callifornia and has lived most of his adult life in Asia and Europe. For many years he lived in India studying meditation and the healing arts. Atreya is the author of three books on the healing traditions of India, Purana: The Secrets of Yogic Healing. 1996; Practical Ayurveda: Secrets for Physical, Sexual and spiritual Health 1998; and Ayurvedic Healing for Women, 1999; and Ayurvedic Healing for Women, 1999. He currently lives with his wife in France and is the director of the European Institute of Ayurveda Studies.
