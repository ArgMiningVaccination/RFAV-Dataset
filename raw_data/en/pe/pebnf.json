Every meal, no matter how dazzlingly creative, no matter how much care you put into it, will end up the same way: you will be left with a mess. The dirty dishes in the kitchen seem to outnumber the clean ones you started with. The kitchen looks like a crime scene. This, of course, is fertile ground for commerce. The people in charge of inventing cleanup products know that if they can just figure out a way to help make the most distasteful part of the meal even vaguely pleasurable there's a buck to be made. And they are certainly trying. Over the last year or so, designer housewares stores like Williams-Sonoma, Crate & Barrel and the Terence Conran Shop have introduced kitchen cleaning products that promise a transporting experience worthy of a Zen retreat. It's now possible to wash plates with green tea and patchouli dish soap, give the countertop a swipe with rosemary-grapefruit spray, clean windows with a spritz of lemon verbena and scrub the sink with a lavender powder. The new products take an aromatherapy approach to kitchen drudgery: they're all blends of so-called essential oils and plant extracts (with a few synthetics added). At spa prices, of course. ''Pine-Sol is for the 1950's housewife, it's not a product for the 21st century,'' said Adam Lowry, a vice president of Method, a new San Francisco company that makes the line sold at the Terence Conran Shop. He has a point -- as much as pragmatists may balk at it. ''People tell you they buy cleaning products based on performance,'' said Dr. Pamela Dalton, a cognitive psychologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. ''But the deciding factor in blind tests is always fragrance.'' The Method products include Kitchen, a bright orange liquid made for cleaning kitchen surfaces while imparting an aroma called bamboo. ''This gives the overall scent of the rain forest, where bamboo is grown,'' Mr. Lowry said. His company makes a limpid blue cleaner called Glass, which he described as a cocktail of aromas and which claims to smell like coral. Like the other companies, Mr. Lowry's targets customers in their 20's and 30's who associate cleanliness with spa scents rather than with the harsh, medicinal odors that screamed ''kills germs dead!'' to their parents. These aromas are ''fresh and clean and create an environment of pampering,'' he said. Indeed. His 28-ounce bottle of soap is $9. Carolyn Forte, who tests cleaning products at the Good Housekeeping Institute in Manhattan, agrees that consumers are looking for little ways to treat themselves well. ''During difficult times, when people are cutting back, anything that gives a pampering experience is worth trying,'' she said. ''There is a trend toward making products smell less like your mother's house.'' Mainstream manufacturers are taking cues from aromatherapists, too. Windex comes in Mountain Berry (fruity, with ammonia undertones). And you have a choice of at least six ''flavors'' when buying liquid dish-washing soap in brands like Dawn (Apple Blossom or Citrus Burst) and Palmolive (Green Apple or Lemon Grove). But the new lifestyle products take the concept much further. Caldrea, a two-year-old company in Minneapolis, is a major manufacturer of aroma-based cleaning products. It produces its own label as well as the products for Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel. The label on its Green Tea Patchouli countertop cleanser says that it contains ''vegetable protein extract'' and ''plant derived cleaning surfactants.'' But what does all that mean? ''We have a proprietary approach to cleaning products, and we want to protect our research and development,'' said Monica Nassif, the company's founder. ''We are as natural as possible. Some parts are synthetic.'' Williams-Sonoma calls its new kitchen cleaning products ''aromatherapy for the home.'' The liquids -- dish soap to floor cleaner -- sound like the cocktail menu at a trendy bar: Meyer Lemon and Mint, Basil and Lemon Verbena, Rosemary and Grapefruit, Lavender and Pine. ''We wanted our customers to have the same scent for their countertop as for their floor cleaner,'' said Donata Maggipinto, whose title is culinary director and trend-translator. ''After dinner, when you're cleaning the kitchen, it's nice to have a cohesive thread in your cleaning products,'' she said. Aromatherapy is based on the idea that inhaling the essential oils and extracts of plants will have healing effects. It is, Dr. Dalton, said, ''one of those areas that has existed on the fringes of science.'' Additionally, aroma is a very subjective experience. Still, research has shown that lavender often has a relaxing effect. Citrus is invigorating. Herbs -- well, those just smell like a kitchen should smell, Ms. Maggipinto said. Enough talk. It was time to take rag in hand. I tried glass cleaners first. Windex ($4.99 for 32 ounces) was my supermarket standard. The professional testers explained that grease and oil were the litmus test for glass cleaners, so I smeared a window with Nivea hand cream on one side and red lipstick on the other: both would leave a greasy, oily film. I used Windex first, and it cleaned both sides completely with four swipes of a terry-cloth rag, and left no residue. The smell was not bad while using it on the glass, but when I put the open bottle to my nose I was shocked at the strength of the ammonia scent. Still, I couldn't help thinking that those chemicals were getting my windows clean. I went on to try Williams-Sonoma's Lavender-Pine Window Wash, which has ethanol (alcohol) rather than ammonia in its recipe. It smelled as mild and perfumey as bubble bath, and I was skeptical that it would work. But to my surprise, it cleaned just as well as Windex, also with four swipes of the rag. Even though the scent isn't one I would want to wear, it was much less harsh than Windex's. And the bottle is especially pretty (in case you care to keep it on your dressing table). Caldrea's Lavender Pine Window Spray worked as well as the others, but its smell was too sweet for me. Mrs. Meyer's, produced by Caldrea, had a mild lemon verbena scent and was pleasant to work with. Method's glass and surface cleaner also did the job as quickly and as well. Mr. Lowry said it contained some ammonia, to avoid streaking (only about a quarter of what Windex has). It was not perceptible. The coral fragrance, the so-called cocktail of aromas, was pleasant enough and reminded me of nice clean shampoo. Later in the day, I had the good fortune to spill a bottle of red cough syrup on my white Formica kitchen counter -- an excellent opportunity for testing surface and countertop cleaners. My supermarket product was green Palmolive Original dish-washing liquid ($1.79 for 13 ounces). It took off the surface pool of medicine but left large deep-pink stains, as did the liquid counter cleaners from Caldrea, Williams-Sonoma and Method. Out came a can of Comet powder from under the sink. There was one new powder cleanser in the group of products, Mrs. Meyer's Kitchen Scrub. It took the pink stains off just as quickly and easily as Comet did when wiped with a moist paper towel. The Comet, which smelled fine in the can, left an unpleasant chlorine odor on my hands. Mrs. Meyer's left no trace of any smell. Even at $7.99 for 12 ounces, I was sold. Now for the sink, which was full of dishes. Again, the test was oil and grease. I smeared a stack of plates with butter and cream cheese. My supermarket standard -- green Palmolive liquid -- worked fine. It created mountains of bubbles that lasted and lasted. Once again, all the designer dish liquids cleaned well, too. They also produced cleansing bubbles, but Palmolive's bubbles lasted longer. The biggest difference was still aroma. To my taste, many of the perfumes were too sweet and cloying, some even made me feel a bit queasy. The Method Kitchen scent, bamboo, is a blend of Chinese ginger, gardenia, citrus and a Hawaiian flower called awapuhi. Mr. Lowry said it was formulated to complement the kitchen. To me, it should have been left in the forest. But then again taste in perfume is personal: one woman's Chanel No. 5 is another woman's Poison. Caldrea's Lavender Pine Dish Soap Liquid smelled medicinal and sweet, but Crate & Barrel's Verbena Fields Kitchen Dish Soap was pleasant and herbaceous. Caldrea's Green Tea Patchouli was appealing at night but sickening in the morning, like a heavy perfume. Its Citrus Mint Ylang-Ylang was much more pleasant early in the day. I smelled my dishes after they dried, on the advice of Edward Miller, a chemist at Consumer Reports, who tests cleaning products scientifically. ''When washing your dishes and kitchen implements, be sure the product's smell washes off completely,'' he warned. ''You don't want the scent of lavender-pine in your mashed potatoes.'' In fact, none of my dishes smelled of perfume when dry. However, my hands did, and that was a problem. Unlike the Palmolive, whose scent disappeared with a rinse, the designer dish fragrances seemed bonded to my hands. I prefer my Guerlain Mitsouko to Caldrea's Jasmine Lily. And, besides, once I'm done with the dishes, I don't want any lingering reminders. In the end, I had to conclude that the differences came down to aesthetics and money. For $2, you can buy a bottle of cleaning solution that will get the job done. For $10, you'll get a bottle that looks classy on the counter, and -- some of the time -- has a softer, more appealing scent. Which are consumers more likely to respond to? What should a clean kitchen smell like, anyway -- a rain forest? An operating room? Plain soap? Ms. Forte at Good Housekeeping said that most people were more concerned with performance. ''After all, you want something to cut the grease,'' she said. But Pamela Helms, the chemist at Caldrea, said that clean was only the beginning. ''Some people,'' she said, ''have gone so far as to say our dish soap liquid has elevated washing dishes to a Zen experience.'' Was it possible that the right product could make cleaning the kitchen a Zen experience? Last Friday morning, I called the Dai Bosatsu Zendo, a Zen Buddhist monastery in the Catskills. And guess what? The monks were cleaning. With plain water, and just a drop of Murphy's Oil Soap. Kitchen Cleaning: Couture Labels HERE are some sources for couture cleaners.
