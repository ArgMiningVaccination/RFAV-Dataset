It is based on an unprecedented approach to improving vaccine availability nationwide - making federally purchased vaccine available to both public and private immunization providers. - The program was officially implemented in October 1994 as part of the President's Childhood Immunization Initiative. - The VFC program, as a component of each state's medical assistance plan, is a Title XIX Medicaid program. - VFC covers vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). - Medicaid-eligible children and those providers who provide care to the Medicaid population (i.e., Medicaid providers) represent the majority of VFC federal vaccine-eligible children and VFC providers. - It also includes other VFC program-enrolled providers and the other VFC-eligible children who qualify. Please read the [VFC Frequently Asked Questions](/publication/view/help/507/) document to learn more. See the new [VFC Information for Providers Brochure](/publication/view/marketing/4396/) to learn more about how the VFC program works, who can be a provider, and how to sign up.
