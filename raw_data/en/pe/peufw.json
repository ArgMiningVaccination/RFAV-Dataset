Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of COVID-19-related misinformation has spread and been amplified online. The spread of misinformation can influence COVID-19 beliefs and protective actions, including vaccine hesitancy. Belief in vaccine misinformation is associated with lower vaccination rates and higher vaccine resistance. Attitudinal inoculation is a preventative approach to combating misinformation and disinformation, which leverages the power of narrative, rhetoric, values, and emotion. This study seeks to test inoculation messages in the form of short video messages to promote resistance against persuasion by COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. We designed a series of 30-second inoculation videos and conducted a quasi-experimental study to test the use of attitudinal inoculation in a population of individuals who were unvaccinated (N=1991). The 3 intervention videos were distinguished by their script design, with intervention video 1 focusing on narrative/rhetorical (\"Narrative\") presentation of information, intervention video 2 focusing on delivering a fact-based information (\"Fact\"), and intervention video 3 using a hybrid design (\"Hybrid\"). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to compare the main effect of the intervention on the 3 outcome variables: ability to recognize misinformation tactics (\"Recognize\"), willingness to share misinformation (\"Share\"), and willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine (\"Willingness\"). There were significant effects across all 3 outcome variables comparing inoculation intervention groups to controls. For the Recognize outcome, the ability to recognize rhetorical strategies, there was a significant intervention group effect (P<.001). For the Share outcome, support for sharing the mis- and disinformation, the intervention group main effect was statistically significant (P=.02). For the Willingness outcome, there was a significant intervention group effect; intervention groups were more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine compared to controls (P=.01). Across all intervention groups, inoculated individuals showed greater resistance to misinformation than their noninoculated counterparts. Relative to those who were not inoculated, inoculated participants showed significantly greater ability to recognize and identify rhetorical strategies used in misinformation, were less likely to share false information, and had greater willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Attitudinal inoculation delivered through short video messages should be tested in public health messaging campaigns to counter mis- and disinformation. The study of misinformation and disinformation and how to counter them is not new. There are centuries-old examples of the challenges in rebutting misleading or manipulative information [ Since the pandemic's beginning, a variety of COVID-19-related misinformation and disinformation has spread and been amplified online [ Studies of how to address the current infodemic are nascent. The inaugural World Health Organization (WHO) Infodemiology Conference of 2021 called for more research on interventions to address the infodemic [ Attitudinal inoculation (or, simply, \"inoculation\") is a preventative approach to combating misinformation and disinformation that leverages the power of narrative, rhetoric, values, and emotion. Inoculation theory promises that people can become resistant to persuasion if they perceive a threat from an attempt to change their beliefs or attitudes and if they receive information to refute this attempt [ Inoculation is preemptive, addressing audiences holding \"healthy (ie, preferred) positions,\" or agnostic and undecided [ Studies have supported the effectiveness of attitudinal inoculation as a tool for strengthening resistance to persuasion on public health topics, such as underage alcohol consumption, adolescent smoking initiation, deceptive nutrition-related food claims, unprotected sex, and child vaccine safety claims [ The potential for attitudinal inoculation to combat COVID-19 vaccine misinformation was proposed by van der Linden et al [ This study was built upon our formative evaluation work that identified common rhetorical strategies and COVID-19 vaccine misinformation narratives and used formative surveys to explore their prevalence and validate select survey items that were used in this study [ Based on the identification of the antivax narratives, we selected a prominent metanarrative related to vaccine injury that was used to develop 3 different inoculation messages: (1) a fact-based video, focused on countering false statistics about the science and safety of vaccines; (2) a narrative and rhetoric-focused video, which \"prebunked\" (ie, practice of We designed a series of 30-second inoculation videos and conducted a quasi-experimental study to test the use of attitudinal inoculation in a population of individuals who were unvaccinated. We developed 3 inoculation videos. Each 30-second video contained a \"microdose,\" a weakened example of manipulation, which has been shown not to cause harm in a controlled research setting. The microdoses, while weakened, constitute an \"active threat\" that let people generate cognitive \"antibodies\" [ Description of video types. |Video types||Purpose||Example of video script| |Narrative and rhetoric inoculation||Inoculate viewers against vaccine misinformation strategies, such as manipulation, scapegoating, or conspiratorial reasoning.|| | \"Sometimes, people trying to change your mind this way will show pictures of needles, crying babies, or extreme close-ups of viruses. Sometimes, they'll make videos with sounds that are scientifically proven to provoke a feeling of unease in humans. Strange, but true!\" |Factual rebuttal inoculation||Counter false information about science and safety about vaccines.|| | \"Sometimes, these people talk about 'vaccine injury'. Actual injuries related to vaccines are extremely rare. Only two out of every one million people who received vaccine results even claimed to have been injured. Of those claims, about a third turned out not to be actual injuries related to vaccines.\" |Hybrid||Combine fact-based information and inoculation against misinformation strategies.|| | \"Sometimes, these people talk about 'vaccine injury'. Actual injuries related to vaccines are so rare, you are nearly twice as likely to be struck by lightning.\" \"Actual injuries related to vaccines are extremely rare. You are 769 times more likely to die from COVID than to experience any vaccine injury.\" \"Sometimes, people trying to change your mind this way will show pictures of needles, crying babies, or extreme close-ups of viruses. Sometimes, they'll make videos with sounds that are scientifically proven to provoke a feeling of unease in humans. Strange, but true!\" Based upon our prior research on the relationship between knowledge, attitude, and behavior, we posited 3 hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Relative to noninoculated participants, inoculated participants will demonstrate a greater ability to identify rhetorical strategies typically used in mis- and disinformation videos. Hypothesis 2: Relative to noninoculated participants, inoculated participants will be less likely to report engaging in behaviors that support the spread of COVID-19 mis- and disinformation videos. Hypothesis 3: Relative to noninoculated participants, inoculated participants will report greater intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with a pre-post intervention questionnaire and control group using an organic sampling survey method between June 3 and 5, 2021 [ All participants first answered questions about their demographics, social media and information consumption, exposure to and trust of information about COVID-19 vaccines, and perceptions of vaccine harm. Then, participants in the 3 treatment groups were \"inoculated\" by showing them a 30-second scripted video that highlights narrative or rhetorical tactics used in vaccine misinformation (intervention group 1, \"Narrative,\" n=500), contains factual rebuttal of vaccine misinformation (intervention group 2, \"Fact,\" n=500), or a hybrid of both (intervention group 3, \"Hybrid,\" n=500). The control group (n=500) watched a neutral video that described how to make a paper airplane. Participants were then asked a series of questions on their perceptions of the video. After watching the inoculation video, participants were shown a video stimulus that utilizes the manipulation techniques participants were alerted to in the inoculation video. The same stimulus video was displayed to participants in the control group and all treatment groups. Participants were then asked the same series of questions on their perceptions of the video. The same questions were asked following the intervention/control video and the stimulus video in order to avoid alerting the respondent as to the type of video being assessed. Study design. The study protocol was approved by the American University Institutional Review Board (IRB-2022-295). We had 3 hypotheses of interest. Each hypothesis corresponded to a different dependent variable below. The first hypothesis was related to the ability to identify misinformation, the second was related to willingness to share information, and the third was related to willingness to get vaccinated. The measures described below were designed to correspond to these 3 research questions, though the survey also included other items related to emotional reactance to the content. We selected 3 particular outcomes of interest: The ability to recognize rhetorical strategies in a video containing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine, such as unusual colors, scary music, and vague language (Q25 - Recognize) Willingness to share the video containing misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine (Q24 - Share) Willingness to get vaccinated (Q26 - Willingness) We had the following independent variables: Demographic variables: gender (male, female), age (continuous), race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, other), income (continuous), education (less than high school, high school/General Educational Development (GED), some college, bachelor's degree, postgraduate degree, other) General vaccine attitude covariates: \"Most vaccines do not cause immediate injuries or side effects,\" \"Most vaccines do not lead to long-term side effects,\" \"Vaccines cause more harm than benefit,\" \"Taking a vaccine is likely to give me a disease,\" \"Vaccination can protect me from getting a disease,\" \"Vaccines cause autism,\" and \"Vaccines are designed as a form of government control,\" which was tested and then analyzed as a factor that controlled for vaccine attitudes (see analysis plan) The analyses included 3 steps: first, to conduct descriptive statistics of baseline sample characteristics; second, to analyze multi-item scale development; and third, to test the effect of the 3 interventions in comparison to controls on the endpoints collected after the second video. All final models were adjusted for demographics (age, gender, race, education, and income); baseline value, if available; and mean scores calculated about general attitudes toward vaccines. Baseline characteristics of the sample, including age, gender, race, income, education, and attitudinal variables, were described using means and SDs for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the entire sample and by intervention group. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to test the dimensionality of multi-item scales, which included the scales for prior general vaccine attitudes and the 3 primary study outcomes, namely Recognize, Share, and Willingness. We planned to retain components associated with eigenvalues greater than 1 as long as factor loadings and internal consistency within components, as measured by Cronbach , were acceptable (>.7). When more than 1 component was retained, the varimax rotation was applied to the model to aid in the interpretation of the factor loadings. For retained components, scores were created as the mean of their items. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to compare the main effect of the intervention on the 3 outcome variables. The model for each outcome included the main effect of the intervention adjusted for age, gender, race, education, income, and the scores for prior general attitudes toward vaccines that was formed in the second step of our analysis. For the Share scale, the model also included the baseline Share score from after the first video. For the 3 outcomes, we were interested in testing the null hypothesis of no difference between intervention groups using a 2-tailed statistical test. To control the type 1 error rate resulting from multiple endpoints, we used the Holm method. For outcomes with a significant intervention group This analysis included 1991 subjects. Although 500 (25.1%) subjects were enrolled in each intervention group, not all subjects completed the survey questionnaire, leaving an analysis population of 495 (24.9%) participants in the control group and 480 (24.1%) in the narrative-rhetorical, 489 (24.6%) in the factual, and 489 (24.6%) in the hybrid video intervention groups. Overall, the study population had a mean age of 40.7 (SD 11.8) years, and 968 (50%) were female, 1439 (74%) were non-Hispanic White, 1173 (60%) had a bachelor's degree or higher education, and 773 (40%) reported an income of US $100,000 or more.

PCA of the 7 items measuring prior attitudes toward vaccines retained 2 factors that accounted for 65% of the variance in the data. All items had a high factor loading on 1 of the 2 factors, with loading in the range of 0.71-0.83, while also having small factor loadings of less than 0.2 on the other factor ( For the 3 questions measuring the Recognize outcome, PCA showed the items to be unidimensional, with a single factor accounting for 72% of the variance. Factor loadings were all greater than 0.84, and Cronbach was .81. PCA of the 5 items measuring the Share outcome also retained a single factor that accounted for 70% of the variance in the data. Factor loadings were high (0.70-0.89), and Cronbach was .89.

For the Share scale, support for sharing the mis- and disinformation, the intervention group main effect was statistically significant ( The intervention group effect for the Willingness scale, willingness to get the vaccine, had the second smallest The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of attitudinal inoculation videos on the ability to identify misinformation, willingness to share misinformation, and willingness to vaccinate. We found there was a significant effect of having been exposed to an inoculation video compared to a control video across each outcome of interest. Our results support our initial hypotheses that inoculation messaging can increase the ability to identify misinformation, decrease willingness to share misinformation, and increase willingness to vaccinate. Our study explored not only whether there is an effect of inoculating participants but also whether inoculating against a narrative/rhetorical strategy or against factual misinformation is more effective. We also tested a hybrid video that combined fact-based and narrative/rhetorical strategies within the inoculation message. Past studies into the relative efficacy of narrative/rhetoric compared to fact-based appeals have suggested that narrative approaches are more likely to be persuasive to viewers [ The intervention videos were designed to protect people against being misled by flawed argumentation used in common online mis- and disinformation, such as conspiracy theories [ Furthermore, online platforms are a viable place to disseminate these interventions to affect perceptions and behavior, because information on vaccine injury is viewed and spread on social media and exposure to online misinformation is associated with lower vaccination intentions [ This study has limitations. First, the study sample was not representative of the general population but rather was more highly educated, mobile app users. Testing the effects of the intervention with a broader audience and determining whether there are differential effects among particular subsamples of the population will add to the understanding of the effect of these types of videos. Second, as described before, further investigation is needed to explore whether there may be meaningful differences in narrative versus fact versus hybrid models that could not be detected in this study due to the study design; however, in general, our results suggest that fact-based rhetorical strategies can be as effective as a narrative-rhetoric or hybrid approach. As an infodemic management strategy, approaches that go beyond fact checking, and do not simply focus on countering 1 piece of content, may be valuable. We found that attitudinal inoculation in video-based messages may be an intervention strategy that can be used in designing public health messaging campaigns to counter mis- and disinformation. Online dissemination of these videos could be a viable strategy to increase vaccine uptake and can be tried more broadly. Videos that use attitudinal inoculation to combat COVID-19 vaccine misinformation should be tested with a broader audience beyond the United States and on social media platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok. More research is needed to understand how videos with attitudinal inoculation perform when individuals are in a typical information consumption environment and faced with competing demands for attention. analysis of covariance General Educational Development least squares principal component analysis None declared.
