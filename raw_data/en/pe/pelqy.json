Still in the development of osteopathic principles and how current neuroscience models de- scribing shamanic healing practices of Native American healers may have applicability for osteopathic manip- ulative practices. Recent materials from the Museum of Osteopathic Medicine document when Still was living among the Shawnee and suggest he was familiar with their healing traditions. Although he introduced the body- mind-spirit paradigm, derived from a key Native American healing concept, into Western medicine, this para-digm still lacks scienti c grounding. Neuroscience models may o er a theoretical framework for the 'spiritual ' component of the body-mind-spirit paradigm with brain predictive processing models that describe spiritualexperiences of patients in altered states of consciousness. With its traditional medicine heritage and currentevidence-based approach, the osteopathic profession is in a unique position to promote the scienti c model of holistic care. Introduction: New materials about A.T. Still 's life with Native Americans One purpose of the current commentary is to describe Native American spirituality and healing practices, known as 'shamanism 'in the Western world [ 1], and show how they may have in fluenced A.T. Still in the development of osteopathic medicine. This discussion seems justied by the recent release of materials from the Museum of Osteo- pathic Medicine in Kirksville, Missouri (USA), which formally docu-ment connections with Native Americans that Still described in his autobiography. For instance, he described visiting Native Americans: 'In May, 1853, my wife and I moved to the Wakarusa Mission, Kans., occupied by the Shawnee tribe. It was all Indian there' [2 p. 60- 61]. He also indicated that he treated Native Americans: 'Then with my father I doctored the Indians all fall '[2 p. 61]. As a result, he wrote that 'I soon learned to speak their tongue, and gave them such drugs as white men used, cured most of the cases I met, and was well received by the Shawnees '[2 p. 61 -62]. In addition to the above statements, Still explicitly describedexhuming bodies from Native American graves for dissection so hecould better learn anatomy and bony structure, the results of which influenced the early development of osteopathy [ 2]. Native American culture relies on a rich oral tradition, not a written history [ 3], so few materials are available to corroborate Still's interactions with Native Americans. Therefore, we must rely on information from Still. For in- stance, in addition to being able to speak the Shawnee language [ 4], there is evidence that his daughter Blanche could write the Shawneelanguage ( Fig. 1). He also had a Navajo carpet to cover his table for osteopathic manipulative treatments ( Fig. 2). Further, Native American healing traditions emphasize a holistic approach to maintain a ba- lanced, ful lling lifestyle and view health and well-being as a balance among physical, mental, contextual, and spiritual factors [ 5]. These concepts are also present in Still's early writings [ 6]. The body-mind-spirit paradigm, derived from key Native American healing practices [ 3], is at the core of two healthcare healing principles: the shamanic [ 1] and the osteopathic [ 7]. However, the holistic body- mind-spirit approach to healthcare [ 8] may not be used by all osteo- pathic practitioners since some may prefer a body-mind approach, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2019.10.007 Received 21 March 2019; Received in revised form 30 October 2019; Accepted 31 October 2019Corresponding author.

This duality of osteopathic practices, one led by evidence and the other by principles, may be a source of con flicting views within the profession and worsened by the pressure of a health- care environment shaped by evidence [ 10]. Osteopathic manipulative techniques described with inappropriate metaphoric, non-scienti c, or outdated models can exacerbate this duality [ 10]. Further, scienti c models exist that incorporate traditional medicine practices and spiri-tual components of patients into treatment [ 11,12]. Another purpose of the current commentary is to present neu- roscience models that account for shamanic healing and describe how they may have applicability for osteopathic practices. According to Frecska and Luna [ 11], neuroscienti c explanations based on classical cognition fail to explain therapeutic information during shamanichealing. Thus, the authors proposed a model for therapeutic informa- tion processing that describes two states of consciousness for patients during treatment, i.e., the ordinary and the shamanic/non-ordinary [11]. Neuroscience models may also o er another theoretical frame- work for the 'spiritual 'component of the body-mind-spirit paradigm through a brain predictive processing model that describes spiritual experiences of patients in altered states of consciousness [ 12]. This paper is not historical research because of the scarce materials available at the Museum of Osteopathic Medicine combined to the oral tradition of the Native American culture, it is likely that only historians would have the methods to explore this period of the life of AT Still among the Shawnee. As described throughout our manuscript, our in- tent is to explicitly describe this forgotten heritage that may have in- fluenced AT Still in the early development of osteopathy. This is pos- sible today, because some material is now available from the Museumthat can corroborate his writings in his autobiography. In the mean- time, neuroscienti c models are now available to describe shamanic/Native American healing methods. We consider this is an appropriatetime to present historical and cultural material alongside a scienti c narrative. Further, key connections between osteopathic medicine andNative American concepts https:// www.atsu.edu/museum-of-osteopathic-medicine/dr-stills-heritage- reflects-american-indian-ties . medicine heritage and current evi- dence-based approach, the osteopathic profession is in a unique posi- tion to promote a scienti c model of holistic care that provides a more inclusive approach for the rich variety of interpretations of osteopathicprinciples and practices. Shamanism, Native American spirituality, and healing practices Although the term shaman properly refers to a traditional healer of the indigenous peoples of Siberia, Manchuria, and Central Asia, it is now a generic label for medicine people and spiritual healers from native tribes around the globe [ 1]. Shamans believe two realities re flect state of consciousness: patients in the ordinary state of consciousnessperceive ordinary reality and those in the altered or shamanic state of consciousness enter into and perceive non-ordinary reality [ 13]. A ri- tual component is a key element in the healing shamanic tradition; typically, patients are brought from an ordinary to a non-ordinary reality through methods such as use of medicinal plants (hallucino- gens), monotonous drumming, repeated refrains, fatigue, fasting, and dancing [ 11]. The resulting breakdown of ordinary reality perception is not the ultimate goal; rather, it is to facilitate psychointegration for therapeutic purpose [ 14]. Shamans provide entry to altered states of consciousness from which the patient may return healed, and they areconsidered singularly quali ed to assist those in ordinary and non-or- dinary realities [ 15]. Whereas the Western healing framework is a linear model based on cause and e ect, the traditional healing frame- work does not target symptoms or causes but focuses on returning theindividual to balance [ 5]. Some shamanic traditions use a culturally grounded conceptual framework, e.g., a wheel with four quadrantsrepresenting four elements that impact well-being and must be ba- lanced [ 5]. These four quadrants are context (family, nity, environment, history); mind (cognition, emotion, identity); body(physical genetic makeup, practical needs \u2014including - nancial needs); and spirit (spiritual practices and teachings, dreams,stories) [ 5]. In each Native American tribe, healing traditions of the medicine family are handed down by word-of-mouth from one generation to the next [ 3]. Although each tribe has its own ceremonies or rituals to treat disease, common principles exist across tribes, principally achievingwholeness through a holistic approach that encompasses body, mind, emotions, and spirit [ 3]. This view of wholeness extends to the inter- relation of all living things (i.e., people, nature, spirits, and the lifeforce) and is physically represented by the quadrants of the sacred Medicine Wheel [ 5]. To restore health, the primary focus and concerns for treatment are placed on the 'immortal soul ', which is symbolically placed at the center of the Medicine Wheel to foster balance among the body-mind-spirit-emotions components that compose each of the quadrants [ 5]. Another perspective Native American medicine people hold in common is that all diseases begin and end in the spirit of theperson [ 13]. Spiritual healing involves concepts from non-ordinary reality (e.g., clearance of blocking, negative, or intrusive energies, soulretrieval lost during trauma or illness) and ordinary reality [ 13]. As such, elements from both realities and internal characteristics speci c to the individual, such as thoughts, may function as etiologic factorsand features of healing modalities [ 13]. Native American healers or medicine people can be male or female, and treatment is typically grouped in two categories. Treatment in the rst category may include moving patients from an ordinary to a non- ordinary reality by conducting ritual ceremonies similar to other Fig. 2. Germantown Navajo carpet that A.T. Still used to cover his treatment table. Museum of Osteopathic Medicine, Kirksville, Missouri, USA [2008.33.16].R. Zegarra-Parodi, et al. International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine 33-34 (2019) 31-37 33shamanic traditions [ 11] or ones speci c to Native Americans, such as vision quest, sweat lodge, and Plains Native Sundance [ 16], and by communicating between realities with sand painting, smudging and use of medicinal herbs, or direct interaction with patients through psy- chological counseling or laying on of hands [ 3]. Treatment in the second category requires working directly with the patient's spirit in thenon-ordinary reality, retrieving missing pieces of the spirit to regain health [ 3]. Medicine people use sacred tools, such as a carpet, quartz crystal, feather, rattle, or drum, as protectors or facilitators when 'tra- veling 'between realities [ 3]. Native American medicine people ac- knowledge the self-healing capabilities of patients and consider them-selves a catalyst that facilitates communication between the two realities for healing. Medicine people usually enter an altered state of consciousness for treatment, but they can treat patients in ordinary or altered states of consciousness and recognise that patients have to put great faith and trust in the tools that are used [ 3]. Still lived among the Shawnee, whose name means 'Southerners '. They had a traditional economy based on farming (corn, beans, and squash), hunting, and gathering of wild plants. As was common among hunting tribes, spirituality was an important part of hunting and was expressed through the Native American belief in animism [ 17]. To maintain harmony between humans and the animal spirits and betweenhumans and the plant spirits, it was necessary to conduct certain rituals to keep the world in balance, including sacred medicine bundles and dance ceremonies, such as Bread, Green Corn, and Bu alo Dances, that are related to important hunting or farming periods during the year[17]. The belief in an immortal soul and its predominance over the physical body were expressed during funeral rites, too. Before burial,the body was dressed, painted, and sprinkled with sacred tobacco, al- lowing the soul to leave the physical body [ 17]. Native American healing traditions and Still 's views on religion and spirituality Over time, Still presented himself as 'bonesetter 'and 'magnetic healer ', and his attraction to magnetic healing was tied to his evolving religious beliefs [ 18]. Although raised a Methodist, by the time he ar- rived in Kirksville, Missouri, Still was a spiritualist, which is a personwho believes the living can communicate with the dead [ 18]. In addi- tion to magnetic healing, other theories and movements, such asphrenology in the form of phrenomagnetism and Swedenborgianism, influenced him in the development of his new way of treating patients without medicinal drugs [ 19,20]. In 1851, Still's parents were transferred by the Methodist church to the Wakarusa Shawnee Indian Mission in eastern Kansas. Still and hisfamily moved with them. There, he farmed and learned the Shawnee language while assisting his father in providing medical care to the tribe [ 19]. Materials from the Museum of Osteopathic Medicine in Kirksville, Missouri (USA) suggest Still was exposed to Native Americantraditional healing methods. Below one of his pictures, he added the handwritten note Hoconethowa , which is the Shawnee word for doctor (Fig. 3) and may have been referring to himself as a Native American traditional healer or as a Western healer. Either of these interpretations are possible since Hoconethowa may be used for both these meanings. He also had a sacred Navajo carpet to cover his treatment table ( Fig. 2 ), a tool typically given by a Native American traditional healer to another one [ 3]. Still wrote several texts on health, disease, and his philoso- phical stance on both. Some are replete with religious overtones [ 21] and could now be understood from another angle as they may refer to non-ordinary reality elements, such as that described by Native Amer-ican healers. Key concepts from Native American spirituality and healing prac- tices were used by Still when describing the emerging osteopathic profession in the context of existing medical practices [ 6]. He men- tioned that patients have self-healing capacities and a body-mind-spiritconnection, stressed the importance of the spiritual component fortreatments that encompass the belief in the immortality of the soul, andfocused on restoring health versus defeating pathology and on multi- factorial versus reductionistic etiology. However, important di erences exist between Native American and osteopathic healing practices(Table 1). The primary target for treatments is one di erence: Native American healers target the spiritual component while osteopathicpractitioners have until recently targeted the physical body through touch-based techniques. Consequently, no techniques used by Native Americans to promote a patient's non-ordinary reality have been for- mally included in osteopathic practices, where patients remain in the ordinary reality. The therapeutic context is also di erent between these healing practices, but spiritual and religious dimensions have to beconsidered through the lens of Western societies where understanding of human experiences have been mostly shaped by philosophy and science [ 23]. Native American healers and patients share the same cosmogony [ 15]; therefore, patients fully rely on the healers because they trust and recognise the healers as the only ones able to help them [3]. Conversely, osteopathic principles promote patient autonomy and foster active input from patients during treatment, so they do not ex-clusively rely on the therapeutic actions of the practitioner [ 21]. In practice, however, osteopathic practitioners sometimes assume the roleof a 'treater ', taking away patient autonomy [ 24]. While it is likely that Still was inspired by Native American spiri- tuality and healing practices, he had many other infl uences [ 18] and interpretations of medical, traditional, and spiritual healing principlesthat were common in the Midwestern United States at the end of the 19th century. The current commentary is not intended to be strictly Fig. 3. Picture of A.T. Still showing his handwritten note of Hoconethowa , the Shawnee word for doctor.

International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine 33-34 (2019) 31-37 34historical, so we have not attempted to capture complex nuances, people, meanings, events, and ideas of the past that in fluence and shape the present [ 25]. Such a task would be outside of our scope and require methods speci cally applicable to osteopathy [ 20]. Documentation al- ready exists describing Still's potential in fluences from theological, medical, alternative medical, spiritual, sociological, and demographic movements in the development and evolution of osteopathic principles and practices [ 20]. To date, Native American healing traditions have not been included. Even though those traditions rely on oral trans-mission rather than written documentation [ 3], the few materials pre- sented in the current commentary may portray Still as Native American traditional healer or as a Western healer, i.e., a medical doctor, who was well accepted and integrated in a Native American tribe. Therefore, we encourage historical researchers to methodologically [ 20] in- vestigate the period when Still was living among the Shawnee anddocument to what extent he was acquainted with their healing methods. Still did not record a speci c list of osteopathic principles and practices, so a historical framework was developed to understand the evolution of osteopathic principles and practices over three periods: original (1874 -1910), traditional (1910 -1953), and modern (1953- present) [ 26]. Regarding the commonalities between Native American and osteopathic principles, our commentary speci cally focuses on the body-mind-spirit paradigm described by Still that disappeared duringthe traditional period and was reintroduced in 2002 [ 7] during the modern period [ 26]. Body-mind and body-mind-spirit paradigms for osteopathicprinciples and practice In 2002, Rogers et al. [ 7] proposed updated de nitions of osteo- pathic principles and expanded the dualistic division of body and mind.However, instead of stating that a person is a unit, they attempted to dene what constitutes a person and included 'spirit 'in that de nition [21]. Both body-mind and body-mind-spirit medicines have been pre- viously de ned [ 8] and may have potential implications for current osteopathic principles. A body-mind approach implies integration ofmodern scienti c medicine, psychology, nutrition, exercise physiology, and belief to enhance the natural healing capacities of the body andmind with an end result of self-care [ 8]. A body-mind-spirit approach uses art and science in pursuit of optimal health rather than the absenceof sickness [ 8]. It is characterized by a philosophical commitment to whole-person care and embraces the entire individual. In this approach, each person is considered an integration of physical, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual aspects that are equally important for health [8]. Body-mind-spirit medicine draws on diverse disciplines, including neurobiology, developmental psychology, behavioral medicine, andspiritual healing [ 8]. Thus, manipulative techniques may be usedTable 1 Comparison of traditional Native American and shamanic healing practices, osteopathy and osteopathic medicine, and modern Western allopathic medicine prin- ciples (adapted from Struthers et al.

Frecska and Luna [ 11] proposed a model to describe the two rea- lities, i.e., the ordinary and the non-ordinary, where shamans could treat patients and where therapeutic information would be processed through two channels. The rst channel is 'perceptual-cognitive-sym- bolic ', which represents ordinary reality [ 11]. It relies on sensory per- ception, cognitive processing, and symbolic (visual, verbal, and logical language) mediation. Its main purpose is task solving and, thus, it ex- emplies the typical Western scienti c thinking of allopathic medicine [11]. The second channel is 'direct-intuitive-nonlocal ', which represents non-ordinary reality. It was introduced for a possible ontological in- terpretation of traditional medicine treatments. As such, it provides a direct experience with no subject-object split and is unbound by lan- guage or other symbols [ 1,11]. The two channels for therapeutic information have descriptive ap- plicability for Native American healing methods applied in both reali- ties and, potentially, for osteopathic manipulative techniques applied solely in the ordinary reality. Information would be processed through a'perceptual-cognitive-symbolic 'approach, a characteristic of ordinary reality, in an osteopathic body-mind paradigm [ 11]. Current evidence- based models for manual clinical and therapeutic practice are shaped by pain mechanisms and neuroscience commonalities [ 27,28]. There- fore, practitioners from di erent professions may use the same manual technique after using a similar clinical algorithm. As an example, a recent review of the physiologic and biomechanics e ects associated with cervical manipulation focused on chiropractic and osteopathicduring the search process [ 29], but the evidence-based clinical in- formation obtained is likely applicable to all other manual professions. Therapeutic information would be processed through a 'direct-in- tuitive-nonlocal 'approach, a characteristic of non-ordinary reality, in an osteopathic body-mind-spirit paradigm. As an example, practitionerswould use manual techniques similar to laying on of hands described by Native American healers that address the spiritual component of the patient's health [ 11]. From a neurological perspective, laying on of hands techniques can be described as the use of gentle/a ective touch on peripheral tissues to alter interoceptive pathways and theoretically modify sensitization states [ 30]. One example may be the biodynamic model of osteopathy in the cranial eld, a vitalistic model in fluenced by Sutherland's theories [ 31]. According to McPartland and Skinner [ 32] p. 30], 'this model does not work with \"energy \"but with the con- sciousness of the natural world ', and 'what is observed during treatment is not the result of mesmerism, coloured by a vaguely vitalistic theory,but evidence of a precisely organised natural system that requires dis- cipline and dedication to develop the practitioner's perceptual faculty '. While the willingness to describe osteopathic experiences should beencouraged, practitioners should be careful with their descriptions be- cause misuse of metaphors in medicine can be potentially harmful [ 33]. Instead, practitioners should use scienti c terminology based on cur- rent scienti c models [ 34]. To describe osteopathic palpatory experi- ences in descriptive terms such as 'di- rect-intuitive-nonlocal 'should be preferred. The inclusion of the body-mind-spirit paradigm in the updated os- teopathic principles from 2002 [ 7]r eflects a holistic approach of healthcare originally described by Native Americans [ 3] and in- corporated into Western medicine by Still [ 6]. Evans [ 21] suggested this inclusion re flected the growing body of evidence supporting a biopsychosocial (BPS) approach to healthcare, which shares many features of holism. Since pain results from interplay of mechanical, biochemical, psychological, and social factors, guidelines for the man- agement of musculoskeletal pain recommend using a BPS model [ 35] (Table 1). Previous holistic osteopathic models included a variety of contributing factors to address patient symptoms, such as Fryette's total osteopathic lesion model [ 36], but they did not provide information about prognosis or possible management options apart from hands-onmanagement. Smith [ 37] proposed a model for an osteopathic BPS approach that included spiritual needs. This approach would in- corporate empathetic listening, investigate meaning and purpose and their impact on symptoms, integrate pain-related beliefs into cognitive behavioural therapy, use personal spiritual practice as part of treat- ment, and explore connections with others. Incorporating religion and spirituality dimensions into Western medicine may foster a more hol- istic, ethical, and compassionate practice of medicine [ 38]. However, because those dimensions are part of traditional medicines and esoterichealing traditions [ 1], some Western practitioners may be reluctant to include them in patient care [ 39]. Recently, a care package combining osteopathy, secular mindfulness, and acceptance and commitment therapy known as the Osteopathy, Mindfulness and Acceptance-based Programme (OsteoMAP) was designed to maximise the therapeutic advantages of physical, psychological, and spiritual therapeutic inter- ventions [ 40]. The OsteoMAP pilot study showed this innovative combination of evidence-based treatments was feasible and well re-ceived, and it had some bene cial eects [ 40]. Thus, the proposed osteopathic principles from 2002 [ 7] border traditional healing methods and a modern evidence-based approach. As such, they o er the osteopathic profession a unique opportunity to promote a scienti c paradigm of holistic care that encompasses both body-mind and body-mind-spirit approaches. Conclusion: A possible scienti c paradigm to encompass osteopathic principles and practices Modern and holistic musculoskeletal practice should provide an evidence-based practice that addresses all patient needs, including re- ligious and spiritual dimensions as part of the body-mind-spirit para- digm [ 37]. Clinical models have been proposed to address these di- mensions in musculoskeletal practice and are based on questionsshamans ask to develop a diagnosis [ 41]. However, these models may represent a simplistic Western view that includes an unhelpful culturalreductionism of shamanic traditions that have to be contextualized within their speci c cosmogony [ 23]( Table 1). Therefore, a more prudent approach is recommended when referring to shamanic tradi-tions as descriptors of what remains unknown in Western medicine. Instead, incorporation of these traditions into Western musculoskeletal practice should be limited to scienti c models that address religious and spiritual dimensions in professional and ethical ways. Currently, body-mind-spirit concepts in medicine are being in- vestigated in the eld of psychoneuroimmunology, which studies the eects of thoughts, emotions, and mental state on health [ 8]. According to the Frecska and Luna [ 11] model, when the coping capability of 'perceptual-cognitive-symbolic 'processing is exhausted during induced states of altered consciousness, a frame shift from the ordinary to thenon-ordinary reality occurs through a 'direct-intuitive-nonlocal ' channel, and patients access a spiritual multidimensional reality. Cog-nitive neuroscience and, speci cally, the computational model of brain predictive processing o er powerful tools to directly investigate the neurocognitive basis of religious and spiritual experiences that occur in altered states of consciousness [ 12]. In general, humans use cognitive models based on previous experiences to predict and perceive theworld, and these models are updated when individuals are presented with con flicting predictions or sensory information. Interestingly, this process may describe what is occurring in the brain of an individual inthe non-ordinary reality [ 12]. Recently, van Elk and Aleman [ 12] proposed a brain predictive processing framework that has the potentialto account for the emergence of religious visions and hallucinations,mystical experiences, personal experiences of God, and the acceptance and maintenance of religious beliefs. The body-mind-spirit paradigm of health, derived from key Native American healing principles, shapes current osteopathic principles and practices [ 7]. Recent advances in the neurosciences may o er theore- tical frameworks that encompass the rich variety of osteopathicR. Zegarra-Parodi, et al. International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine 33-34 (2019) 31-37 36practices with the two characteristics of therapeutic information pro- cessing described by ordinary and non-ordinary realities [ 11]. Further, the neurosciences may o er other theoretical frameworks for the spiritual component of the body-mind-spirit paradigm through a pre- dictive processing model that describes the spiritual experiences of patients in altered states of consciousness [ 12]. While osteopathic pa- tients remain in the ordinary reality during treatment, descriptivemodels for shamanic healing of patients in the non-ordinary reality may have some applicability for osteopathic manipulative techniques be- cause those models include a patient's spiritual component. Although these integrative neuroscience models look appealing as a support for clinical interpretations of osteopathic principles and practices, they will remain purely theoretical unless formally tested. The following quote from Still's autobiography nicely summarizes two key points of the current commentary: When I looked up the subject and tried to acquaint myself with the works of God, or the unknowable as some call Him, Jehovah as another class say, or as the Shawnee Indian calls Him, the great Illnoywa Tapamalaqua, which signi es the life and mind of the living God, I wanted some part that my mind could comprehend. I began to studywhat part I should take up rst to investigate the truths of nature, and place them down as scienti c facts [2 p. 295]. First, Still seems to suggest that the spiritual beliefs of the Shawnee were similar to others, a viewpoint that has not been explicitly de-scribed before, highlighting a universal message of tolerance. Second, spiritual and scienti c understanding were growing in tandem. Thus, with its traditional medicine heritage and current evidence-based ap-proach, the osteopathic profession is in a unique position to promote the scienti c model of holistic care. Declaration of competing interest Rafael Zegarra-Parodi reports a competing interest because he is on the editorial member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine . However, he had no role in the review or de- cision making associated with this manuscript. Jerry Draper-Rodi, Jason Haxton, and Francesco Cerritelli declare there no con flict of in- terest. Acknowledgment Rafael Zegarra-Parodi would like to thank the medicine people from the Lakota and Shawnee tribes who shared part of their traditions and reviewed the content of the manuscript.
