I do long distance running and Peleton and suffer from lower back pain plus have a few injuries incl. one shoulder that was broken a few years ago. This combined with stiff neck and shoulders due to lots of computer work, makes me suffer from constant pain. I have tried a lot of massages and other therapies incl. chiropractors and osteopaths without any change. I have never tried shiatsu, so I thought I'd give it a go. I have now had a few treatments and its been life changing. Most of my pain is gone and my mobility highly improved. I can relax at a deeper level and feel so much better both physically and mentally. Thomas is highly skilled, extremely knowledgable and professional. He puts you at ease immediately, ask questions and has the ability to work with you on many levels. I was invited to one of his Qi Gong classes and it was a wonderful treat to combine the treatments with some physical movements. I can only recommend his services, as he is way beyond a traditional massage therapist/bodyworker, since he is a clinical shiatsu practitioner. GO SEE Thomas when you are in Bozeman, you won't regret it. I personally look forward to get ready for my next running race, pain free. - 9/10/2020First to Review I had two massages with Thomas when I visited Bozeman. One was a table massage and the other was Shiatsu. Both sessions blew my mind as Thomas is such a real professional in massage and mind healing. The studio is clean, modern, and zen-like displaying some wonderful products such as essential spray and tea. His technique is a combination of long strokes and soft touch, which is perfect for pain and anxiety relief. I will definitely visit him when I come back "}
