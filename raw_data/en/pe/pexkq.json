LETTER FROM THE CEO The Scripps story began with a strong commitment to the San Diego community . -A commitment that continues today - Our founders, Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings, were both women ahead of their time. Their commitment to provide for the health care needs of a growing community resulted in the Scripps Health of today. Miss Ellen, as she was known, preferred the term \"investment\" over \"donation\", and her contributions were carefully considered as much for their future promise as for their immediate impact. Decades earlier, Mother Mary Michael's patient logs illustrated her fundamental mission to make quality health care available to all who needed it. Today, more than 20,000 employees, physicia ns and volunteers continue to build on our rich history and keep the spirit of community service alive. The pages that follow provide a comprehensive account of how we achieve that: our community benefit programs and services, and our plans for continued action in the future. In Fiscal Year 2021 Scripps community benefit contributions totaled $538,036,955 This includes $494,197,396 in uncompensated care, $33,228,894 in professional education and health research, $8,050,371 in community health services and $2,183,502 in subsidized health, and $376,792 in community building activities . The challenges presented by COVID- 19 these past two years have been difficult for our community and our physicians, nurses , and staff. Yet each day our incredible clinical and support teams find ways to care for those with COVID or with any health care need, and each year thos e valiant efforts have a positive impact on thousands of lives. As we look ahead, we know that we will face new challenges. At Scripps we are continually changing to better meet our patients' needs, improve access in our community, reduce our costs, and simply bring more value to the patients we serve. When Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings brought quality health care to San Diego 100 years ago, they could never have imagined the care we provide today or the more than 600 ,000 lives we t ouch each year. As a private, tax -exempt heath care system, Scripps will continue our legacy of making a vital and measurable difference in our community. C hris Van Gorder, FACHE President and CEO MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES MISSION Scripps strives to provide superior health services in a caring environment and to make a positive, measurable difference in the health of individuals in the communities we serve.

Passed in 1994, the bill requires California's not -for-profit hospitals to annually describe and document the full range of community benefits they provide. Scripps has taken this legislative requirement a step further. This report incorporates not only documentation of community benefits, but also a more detailed explanation of the specific community benefit activities provided by our five acute- care hospital campuses, wellness centers and ambulatory care clinics. The report details programs and services that provide community benefits beyond standard practices of care. Scripps divides community benefit services into three main categories . Uncompensated care includes charity care, bad debt, and Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfalls .

A hospital or health care system service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital. Scripps serves the entire San Diego C ounty region with services concentrated in North Coastal, North Central, Central and Southern region of San Diego. Scripps provides significant and growing volumes of emergency, outpatient, and primary care. In F iscal Y ear 202 1, Scripps provided 2,610,833 outpatient visits . Community outreach efforts are focused in those areas with proximity to a Scripps facility. Scripps hosts, sponsors, and participates in many community -building events throughout the year .

Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) originated from California statewide legislation in the early 1990s. SB 697 took effect in 1995, which required private not -for-profit hospitals to submit detailed information to the Department of Healthcare Access and Information (HCAI) on their commu nity benefit contributions. Formerly named the Office of Statewide H ealth Planning and D evelopment (OSHPD) . Annual hospital community benefit reports are summarized by HCAI in a Report to the Legislature, which provides valuable information for government officials to assess the care and services provided to their constituents. The SB 697 requirement was supplemented in 2010 by requirements in the Patient Protection and Aff ordable Care Act or ACA that not -for-profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessments with community stake holders to determine significant health needs of the community they serve and i mplementation strategies to help meet those needs. Additional information on the ACA requirements for not -for-profit hospitals can be found at http://www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations.\" For more detailed information on the CHNA regulatory requirements and Implementation Strategy see Appendix E . As part of the federal reporting requirement for private, not -for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals, Scripps conducts a consolidated Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and corresponding joint implementation's strategy for its licensed hospital facilities every three years. This comprehensive account of health needs in the community is designed for hospitals to plan their community benefit programs together with other local health care institutions, community -based organizations, and consumer groups. The 2019 Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. The report helps us understand our community's health needs and inform community benefit planning and the i mplementation strategy for Scripps Health. In addition, the assessment allows interested parties and members of the community a mechanism to access the full spectrum of information relative to the development of the Scripps Health 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 15 CHNA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This executive su mmary provides a high-level su mmary o f the 201 9 CHNA methodology an d findings.

Provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County, as well as inform and guide local hospitals in the development of their programs and strategies that address identified community healt h needs. Build on and strengthen community partnerships established through theprevious CHNA process. OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND HASD&IC contracted with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) to assist with the collaborative health needs assessment that was officially called the HASD&IC 201 9 Community Health Needs Assessment (2019 CHNA). The 2019 CHNA was implemented and managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representatives from seven hospitals and health systems: Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego Palomar Health Rady Children's Hospital - San Dieg o Scripps Health Sharp HealthCare Tr-City Medical Center UC San Diego Health 8U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, HHS action plan to reduce racial and ethnic health dis parities.

Throughout the process, the IPH met bi -weekly with the HASD&IC CHNA committee to analyze, refine, and interpret results as they were being collected. COMMUNITY PRIORITY PROCESS (CHNA METHODOLOGY ) The 2019 CHNA quantitative analyses of publicly available data provided an overview of critical health issues across San Diego County, while qualitative analyses of feedback from the community provided an appreciation for the experiences and needs of San Diegans. The CHNA Committee reviewed these analyses and applied a pre- determined set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in San Diego County. This process is represented in F igure 2. 4. For a complete description of the HASD&IC 2019 proces s and findings, see full report available at https://www.hasdic.org/2019- chna . 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 18 FIGURE 2.4. 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS MAP 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 19 QUANTITATIVE Quantitative data were drawn from several public sources. Data from Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Needs Index (CNI) and the Public Health Alliance of Southern California's Healthy Places Index (HPI) were used to identify geographic communities in San Diego County that were more likely to be experiencing health inequities, which guided the selection of communities for the engagement and the development of engagement questions . Hospital discharge data exported from SpeedTrack 's California Universal Patient Information Discovery, or CUPID application were used to identify current and three- year trends in primary diagnosis discharge categories and were stratified by age and race. This allowed for the identification of health disparities and the conditions having the greatest impact on hospitals and health systems in San Diego County. Data from national and state- wide data sets were analyzed including San Diego County mortality and morbidity data, and data related to social determinants of health . In addition, Kaiser Permanente consolidated data from several national and state- wide data sets related to a variety of health conditions and social determinants of health in San Diego County and conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to ident ify which social determinants of health were most predictive of negative health outcomes. Kaiser Permanente then created a web-based data platform (chna.org/ kp) to post these analyses for use in the CHNA. These analyses guided the design of the online survey, interview, and focus group questions. QUALITATIVE - COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Community engagement activities included focus groups, key informant interviews, and an online survey which targeted stakeholders from every region of San Diego County, all age groups, and numerous racial and ethnic groups . Collaboration with the County of San Diego Health & Human Services Agency, Public Health Services was vital to this process. A total of 579 individuals participated in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment: 138 community residents and 441 leaders and experts. Please see F igure 2.5 below for details on the types of participants engaged. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 20 FIGURE 2.5. 2019 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PARTICIPANTS 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 21 2019 CHNA PRIORITIZATION OF THE TOP HEALTH NEEDS The CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. Several criteria were applied to the data to determine which health conditions were of the highest priority in San Diego County. These criteria included: the sever ity of the need, the magnitude/scale of the need; disparities or inequities and change over time. Those health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) that met the largest number of criteria were then selected as top priority community health n eeds. 2019 FINDINGS : TOP 10 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS The CHNA Committee identified the following as the highest priority community health needs in San Diego County (in alphabetical order by SDOH or health condition). FIGURE 2.6. 2019 TOP 10 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS Figure 2. 6 illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions -each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH, which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. Access to health care. Overcoming barriers to health care, such as lack of health insurance and insurance issues, economic insecurity, transportation, the shortage of 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 22 culturally competent care, fears about immigration status, and the shortage of health care providers emerged as a high priority community need. In addition, specific services were identified as challenging to obtain, including behavioral health care, dental care, primary care, and specialty care. Aging concerns . Conditions that predominantly affect people who are 65 and older such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, dementia, falls, and limited mobility were identified as a high priority health need. Community engagement participants m ost often described aging concerns in relation to the social determinants of health, including transportation, access to fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, and economic insecurity. Behavioral health. Greater access to behavioral health care was cited as a priority healt h need. Three types of behavioral health care were identified as challenging to access: urgent care services for crisis situations; inpatient psychiatric beds and substance abuse facilities; and transitional programs and services for post -acute care. In ad dition, several barriers to behavioral health care were named as priorities to address, including a lack of availability of needed services and appointments, insurance issues, logistical issues, such as transportation and time off work, and the inability t o pay co -pays and deductibles. Cancer . Health needs related to cancer were described in relation to the effects on well-being beyond physical health. These include financial, practical, and emotional impacts on individuals and families; these effects are exacerbated by barriers to cancer care. Chronic conditions . Three chronic conditions were identified as priorities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Key factors that individuals struggle with to prevent chronic diseases include access to fresh, health foods and safe places to exercise and play. In addition, economic issues, transportation to medical care, fears about immigration status, and a lack of knowledge about chronic conditions were named as particular challenges related to the management of chronic conditions. Community and social support. A high priority for the well -being of San Diego residents is ensuring that individuals have adequate resources and substantial support within their neighborhood. Valuable neighborhood resources include federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and those that are culturally and linguistically competent. Without adequate support from others, community engagement and community spirit are affected. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 23 Economic security. Economic security was named as vitally important to the well - being of San Diego residents and was described as impacting every aspect of residents' daily life. The health of those who are economically insecure is negatively affected by food insecurity, chronic stress and anxiety, and the lack of time and money to take care of health needs. In San Diego County, 13.3% of residents have incomes below the federal poverty level and 15% experience food insecurity. Those who are economically insecure are at greater risk of poor mental health days, as well as asthma, obesity, diabetes, stroke, cancer, smoking, pedestrian injury, and visits to the emergency department for heart attacks. Factors identified as contributing to economic insecurity include housing and childcare costs as well as low wages. Education . Receiving a high school diploma, having the opportunity to pursue higher or vocational education, being health literate, and having opportunities for non- academic continuing education were identified as important priorities for the health and well -being of San Diego residents. Family stress and a lack of school and community resources were identified as factors underlying low levels of educational attainment. Homelessness and housing instability . Homelessness and housing instability were named as key facto rs affecting the health of San Diego County residents. They were described as having serious health impacts, such as increasing exposure to infectious disease, creating substantial challenges in the management of chronic diseases and wound care, and increasing stress and anxiety. Poor housing conditions were also cited as impactful of physical and mental health; crowded housing leads to the spread of illness, and environmental hazards can exacerbate conditions like asthma. Unintentional injury and violence . Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impac tful on mental health. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 24 COMMUNITY RESOURCES The 2019 CHNA identified many health resources in San Diego County, including those provided by community -based organizations, government departments and agencies, hospital and clinic partners, and other community members and organizations engaged in addressing many of the health needs identified by this assessment. In addition, 2-1- 1 San Diego is an important community resource and information hub that facilitates access to services. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, 2-1- 1 San Diego helps connect individuals with community, health, and disaster services. In addition to community input on health conditions and social determinants of health, a wealth of ideas emerged from community engagement participants about how hospitals and health systems could support, expand, or create additional resources and partner with organizations to better meet San Diego's community health needs. Please see Figure 2. 7 for the types of resources that were identified by community engagement participants . NEXT STEPS The 2019 CHNA is utilized by Scripps Health and participating hospitals and health systems to e valuate opportunities for next steps to address the top identified health and social needs in their respec tive patient communities . In addition, the CHNA report is made available to the broader community and is intended to be a useful resource to both residents and health care providers to further communitywide health access and health improvement efforts. Scripps is currently working with the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) and the Community Health Needs Assessment Committee on the 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Beginning in 2021, every private hospital, health system, health district and behavioral health hospital in San Diego is now part of our collective CHNA effort to better understand the health and social needs of San Diego communities. The collaborative CHNA provides information that helps hospitals and health systems adjust their programs and services to better meet the specific health needs of the communities they serve. In addition, the CHNA Committee is re-envisioning how best to work collaboratively in a virtual environment and continuing to look at health and social needs from a health equity framework. The 2022 CHNA is expected to be finalized in the fall of 2022. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 25 FIGURE 2.7. RESOURCES & OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 26 HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OF SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES ; 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PHASE TWO BACKGROUND & INTRODUCTION In July 2019, the Hospital Association of San Diego, and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) completed the triennial collaborate community health needs assessment (CHNA) to identify and prioritize the health needs of San Diego County residents, particularly those who experience health inequities. The CHNA is managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representatives from hospitals, and health systems and health districts. HASD&IC contracted with the Institute of Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) to conduct the needs assessment. The CHNA Committee worked with IPH to distribute a follow- up survey to gather feedback on the 2019 CHNA findings through a Phase 2 Survey . The survey sought to further explore frequently recurring themes that emerged during community discussions in the 2019 CHNA , including: access to care, stigma, immigration, and public charge. Note: The Phase 2 Survey was developed and disseminated prior to the COVID -19 pandemic taking hold in the San Diego region. The CHNA Committee recognizes that communities facing inequities are dealing with unprecedented challenges and the devastating increase in needs is not captured in these findings. SURVEY PARTICIPANTS & RESULTS 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 27 Nearly 92% of respondents (114 out of 124 respondents) agreed or strongly agreed that the health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA represent the top health needs of communities facing inequities within San Diego County . Most survey respondents were from community -based organizations (39.5%), followed by hospitals/health systems (16.1%) and community residents (11.3%). A total of 105 survey participants responded to the question about where they live or work. Overall, 37.4% of survey respondents served all regions of San Diego County and 26.8% lived in or work at North Inland.

The Implementation Plan translates the research and analysis presented in the Assessment into actual, measurable strategies and objectives that can be carried out to improve community health outcomes. Scripps Health evaluates the implementation strategy annually because a flexible approach is well suited to developing a response to the Scripps CHNA. The annual evaluation of the implementation plan assesses available resources and interventions and makes adjustments as needed to achieve the implementation strategy's stated goals and outcome measures . Plans to monitor the Implementation Plan are also tailored to each strategy and include the collection and documentation of tracking measures . Scripps describes any challenges encountered to achieve the outcomes and makes modifications as needed. In addition, Scripps Health Implementation Plan is filed with the Internal Revenue Service using Form 990 Schedule H on an annual basis. Scripps Health has a consistent focus on the strategies and initiatives, their measures of implementation and the metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. The complete FY20-FY22 Implementation Plan Report i s available online at Scripps.org. Uncompensated Care 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 31 UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Scripps contributes significant resources providing low and no- cost health care for our patients in need. During F iscal Year 20 21, Scripps contributed $ 494,197,396 in uncompensated health care, including $17,572,864 in charity care, $ 469,353,119 in Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $7,271,413 bad debt. The health care safety net in San Diego County is highly dependent upon hospitals and community health clinics to care for uninsured and medically underserved communities. Finding more effective ways to coordinate and enhance the safety net is a critical policy challenge. While public subsidies help finance services for San Diego County's underinsured populations, these subsidies do not cover the full cost of care. Combined with Medi -Cal and Medicare funding shortfalls, Scripps and other local hospitals absorb the cost of caring for uninsured /underinsured patients in their operating budgets. This places a significant financial burden on hospitals and physicians. Scripps Mercy Hospital (including San Diego and Chula Vista campuses) provides 64 percent of the charity care within the Scripps system (refer to figure 3.3). Scripps Mercy's service area has a more economically disadvantaged population compared to the county, with the lowest numbers of insured adults in the county and a much higher percentage of ethnic minorities, primarily Hispanic and Asian. Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista campuses are designated by the government as a Disproportionate Share Hospital, in reflection of the diversity of the population they serve. Both hospital campuses play important health care service roles in the Central/Southern San Diego County service area (ranging from Interstate 8 to the United St ates-Mexico border). More than half of Scripps Mercy San Diego and Chula Vista patients are government insured Medicare and Medi -Cal. SCRIPPS UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Bad Debt $7,271,413 Charity Care $17,572,864 Medi -Cal & Medicare Shortfall $469,353,119 Uncompensated Health Care Total $494,197,396 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 32 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ASSISTING LOW-INCOME , UNINSURED PATIENTS The Scripps financial assistance policy is consistent with the language of both State (AB774) California Hospital Fair Pricing legislation and the Internal revenue Code (IRC) 501(r) Regulations. These practices reflect our commitment to assisting low -income and uninsured patients with discounted hospital charges, charity care and flexible billing and debt collection practices. These programs are available to everyone in need, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or national origin. Scripps makes every effort to identify patients who may benefit f rom financial assistance as soon as possible and provide counseling and language interpretation. Additionally , Scripps does not apply wage garnishment or liens on primary residences as a way of collecting unpaid hospital bills. Eligibility for financial assistance is based on family income and expenses. For low - income, uninsured patients who earn less than twice the federal poverty level (FPL), Scripps forgives the entire bill. For those patients who earn between two and four times the FPL, a portion of the bill is forgiven. Patients who qualify for financial assistance are not charged more than Scripps discounted financial assistance amount. For 20 22, the Department of Health and Human Services defined a family of four at 200 percent federal pov erty level as $ 55,500. PUBLIC RESOURCE SPECIALIST TEAM The Public Resource Specialists (P RS) are experienced staff with strong knowledge of county programs. PRS screens all uninsured and underinsured patients who have received services at any of the five Scripps hospital facilities. They offer support to patients and provide guidance on available funding options for county, state, and federal programs. The PRS team is responsible for submitting and monitoring all applications and following up with appeals. In addition, they serve as a technical resource to case management, social work, and other hospital staff when patient funding impacts discharge planning and level of care transfers. The PRS team serves hospital patients by offering immediate temporary coverage through the Presumptive Eligibility programs (PE), COVID -19 Uninsured Group and submitting Insurance A ffordability Applications to the county for processing of ongoing benefits. Other services offered are assistance with initiating applications with DMV, VA, EDD , Social Security and Medi -Cal for Cal- Fresh enrollment. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 33 In Fiscal Year 2021 , the PRS team successfully screened 4,551 food insecure patients. Out of those screenings, PRS submitted 3,418 Medi -Cal applications to the County and 31% of the applications submitted were for both Medi -Cal and CalFresh. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 34 Estimated Economic Value of Community Benefits P rovided by Scripps Health in Fiscal Year 2021 CA Senate Bill (SB) 697 & AB1204 Definitions Community Benefit Programs & Services Net Benefit Medical Care Services Charity Care $ 17,572,864 Medi -Cal & Other Government Means Tested Programs (Shortfall) * $ 126,014,072 Medicare & Medicare HMO (Shortfall) ** $ 343,339,047 Bad Debt $ 7,271,413 Total Costs of Uncompensated Care $ 494,197,396 Benefits for Vulnerable Population \"Vulnerable Populations\" means any population that is expose d to medical or financial risk by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi -Cal, Medicare, California Children's Services Program, or county indigent programs. \"Vulnerable populations\" also includes both of the following: Racial and ethnic groups experiencing disparate health outcomes, including Black/African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian Indian, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Vietnamese, Native Hawaiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, or other nonwhite racial groups, as well as individuals of Hispanic/Latino origin, including Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Chicanos,Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Cubans, and Puerto R icans.

Through a prioritization process described in Section 2 , Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), the following health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) were identified as the most critical health and social needs within San Diego County ( listed below in alphabetical order) : Access to Health Care Community and Social Support Aging Concerns Economic Security Behavioral Health Education Cancer Chronic ConditionsHomelessness and Housing Instability Unintentional Injury and Violence FIGURE 4.1. 2019 CHNA TOP HEALTH NEEDS T he figure above illustrate s the interactive nature of the SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH (CalFresh, Medi -Cal, other economic support), which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 43 Stigma was also discussed in relation t o specific heal th conditions, i ncluding be havioral health, ca ncer, diabetes, obesity a nd others.

To acce ss care, pe ople need health insurance coverage and a consistent so urce of c are that provides evidence- based, c ulturally co mpetent preventive a nd emergency medical s ervices i n a timely manner. A l ack of health insurance coverage represents a major barrier t o health care se rvices. In San Diego County, it is estimated 11.3% of pe ople under t he age of 65 are uninsured. C ertain groups, including those who identify as \"Other,\" N ative American/Alaska Natives, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, and Blacks, have higher rates of being uninsured than others.16 According to findings from the California Health Care Foundation's (CHCF's) 2021 California Health Policy Survey, h alf of Californians (51%) reported taking at least one action to delay, skip, or cut back on c are in the past 12 months because of concerns related to cost. Of those who delayed care due to cost, 41%reported that their health condition worsened (CHCF, 2021). According to the same survey, more than 1 in 4 lower -income Californians (27%) reported that it was \"somewhat\" or \"very\" difficult to find a provider who took theirinsurance, compared to 10% of Californians with higher incomes (CHCF, 2021). In addition, among Californians with lower incomes, 4 in 10 reported being very worried about affording unexpected medical bills (43%), out -of-pocket costs or mortgage (39%) (CHCF 2021) . 16U.S. Census Bureau. American Community 1-Y ear Es timates 2022 Scripps H ealth Community Benefit P lan & R eport2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 46 Access to care includes two components; the specific services that individuals are unable to obtain and the barriers and SDOH that prevents individuals from obtaining these services. 1. Types of care that are difficult to access2. Barriers to accessing care & associated SDOH Behavioral Health Care Culturally competent care Dental Care Economic security Primary Care Fear related to immigration status Specialty Care Lack of health insurance & insurance issues Shortage of health care providers Transportation A lack of health insurance is a predictor of many health conditions, including more poor mental health days, more visits to the ED for heart attacks, a higher prevalence of asthma, and obesity, more low birth weight babies, and higher prevalence of smoking. Reduced access to basic health care services increases illness, injury and mortality an d is a major burden on hospitals and health providers, who must provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. Access to health care emerged as a high priority health need in both the secondary data analyses and community engagement events in the 2019 Scripp s Community Health Needs Assessment. Through the community engagement conducted we heard from the community that even when insurance is secured, lack of transportation (especially for seniors ) and lack of culturally and linguistically competent care are main barriers. To provide for people in need, Scripps sponsored several programs and activities in Fiscal Year 20 21. SCRIPPS RECUPERATIVE CARE PROGRAM S (RCU) Scripps Health has an agreement with the San Diego City Refuge of Recuperative Care Shelter (RCS) which provides a safe discharge for chronically homeless patients with ongoing medical needs. All patients are unfunded or underfunded. Most have substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Lack of funding, mental illness, as well as alcohol and/or substance abuse, makes post -acute placement of these homeless patients difficult . During the pandemic all San Diego Homeless shelters experienced COVID -19 outbreaks , making RCS a true place of refuge for 44 of our chronically hom eless patients. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 47 The Case Management and Social Work departments assist with a needed supply of medication, appointments, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), setting up Home Health Services if needed, and connects patients to psych as part of the hospital discharge plan to City of Refuge. City of Refuge further supports clients in meeting these goals using community resources to meet individual social service needs. Scripps pays the City of Refuge a daily rate for housing and services they provide to the patients. The City of Refuge provides a safe, secure environment, wit h 24-hour supervision, medication oversight, meals, clothing, case management, assistance with Medi -Cal, with transition to Managed Medi -Cal and disability applications, referrals to rehab and other programs, and help finding permanent or transitional housing using county resources. DME and other needed services are provided by Scripps when funding is not available. All patients are connected to a medical home, and primary care in the community. Patients with psych disorders are established with a psychiatrist in the community if they are willing. Patient transportation needs are coordinated by City of Refuge, but may include insurance funded transport services, and occasionally Scripps Shuttle, or use of taxi voucher. The City of Refuge began taking patients routinely in October of 2019. This year 44 patients so far have met the need for RCS admission, but many did not qualify due to behavior, unstable mental illness, or unwillingness to abstain from substance abuse. As a group, the RCS patients had a cumulative of 480 hospital days of stay, an average of 10.9 hospital days of stay, before going to RCS October 2020 to date. The RCS has taken medically complex patients, including those with: IV antibiotics, wound vac s, skin grafts, fractures, abscesses, osteomyelitis, amputation, dog bites, DKA, GI bleeds, pancreatitis, ESRD on dialysis, end stage liver disease, diabetes, mild encephalopathy, ostomies, MVA, pedestrian cancer), HIV/Aids, sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, CHF. Patients were assault victims with gunshot and stab wounds, facial trauma, and surgical post op patients and m any are diabetic. Psych problems are common and occasionally the main issue for RCS clients . Over 8 0% of this group were either positive for alcohol, drugs or drug screen or had a drug history addressed by the physician in the H & P. More specifically, 30% of RCS clients had used opiates, heroin, or meth. The following are outcome metrics tracked by Scripps for the City of Refuge program. For FY21 total cost savings for Scripps was $735,150. Of Recuperative Care Shelter patients, 22% had standard Medi -Cal insurance, 11% HPE Medi -Cal HMO' s.2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 48 Approximately 20% of patients sought to secure income from government programs, social security, and CA short term disability ; six total clients applied or received income benefits. Four have applied and received Medi -Cal HMO's while at the RCS with the assistance of their case management department. The program assisted Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center patients. RCS assisted two patients in maintaining their health and transitioned them into independent living homes for additional care. This year we had several successes, with the RCS Manager assist ing with three family reunifications out of state. Three patients transitioned to drug rehab centers, and several into PATH, Interfaith, and mental health treatment programs. The Complex Care Manager ensured 90 percent of RCS patients were scheduled and connected to a primary care provider or had established care at one of the community clinics. One of the patients admitted to RCS was established with ongoing oncology care and treatment with assistance from Medi -Cal and Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center . Following the ir stay at City of Refuge : 18% of the RCS patients completed their recuperative care and returned to previous living and 5% went back to the hospital as they needed further treatment . GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION STAFF SUPPORT , ST. LEO'S CLINIC The Graduate Medical Education (GME) program at Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic focuses on physician training and clinical research, residents and fellows. GME residents and many attending physicians maintain an evening clinic at St. Leo's Mission Community Clinic in North County (due to the pandemic, this initiative was put on hold in March of 2020 but resumed in April 2021). Two residents volunteer every Wednesday to provide medical care to uninsured patients with a variety of conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They also identify many acute conditions, including viral infections, skin infections, eye problems and musculoskeletal issues, and educate patients about their health. Patients may get flu vaccinations and some basic lab tests. If needed, St. Leo's patients are referred to providers who provide care at a reduced cost. FIJI SOLOMON ISLANDS MEDICAL MISSION The medical mission consists of Scripps Health general medical specialists and residents setting up clinics on rural islands for the purpose of providing much needed medical care, medical supplies and surgical screening for an underserved population 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 49 that have no access to basic medical care. The International Medical Missions provide an exceptional clinical education experience to our senior Internal Medicine residents at Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital. These resident missions take place in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, where the ratio of doctors to population is 1:20,000. The Loloma Foundation provides medical care to these islanders in association with Scripps Health. Residents experienced the challenges of providing care in Third World conditions, without technology, and using only their excellent academic and practical training to diagnose and treat patients. Islanders with serious medical conditions are referred to the nearest hospital, which is several hours away by boat and car. Due to COVID -19 missions were paused . MERCY OUTREACH SURGICAL TEAM PROVIDES LIFE-CHANGING CARE TO CHILDREN IN MEXICO For three decades, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team ( MOST ) has been crossing borders and changing lives. MOST is an independent, nonprofit organization founded in 1987 at Scripps Mercy Hospital whose mission is to provide free surgeries and vision care to underserved children in Mexico. After the 9/11 terrorist attack, MOST's missions had to be shifted exclusively t o trips in Mexico, due to difficulty getting children across the border from Mexico into the U.S. Working in Mexico, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team provides reconstructive surgeries for children suffering from birth defects or accidents. In special circumstances, surgeries are also provided for adults. In Mexico, MOST volunteers typically perform hundreds of surgeries per mission- and more than 14,000 overall since its founding -for issues like cleft palates, crossed eyes, burn scars, hernia repairs and more. MOST also added a vision program in 2004 that provides more than 100 pairs of eyeglasses per trip to children in need. MOST has been working with an organization in Mexico to sponsor cleft palate and lip surgeries and provided much needed PPE and other medical supplies to Tehuac\u00e1n, a city MOST has visited for mission trips several times, to help care for patients. Since MOST had to pause its travel into Mexico due to COVID -19 restrictions and it had been looking for ways to serve those in need once public health conditions allowed. MOST saw an opportunity to continue its mission in San Diego when the emer gency shelter was opened at the San Diego convention center . During Fiscal Year 202 1, a team of thirty -five volunteers from MOST hosted a free, full day vision clinic inside the San Diego convention center emergency shelter, where they served 615 children, mostly 13 -17 with a few younger ones and perform ed vision screenings and provided prescription eyeglasses to those who needed them . For those who required glasses, they were able to try on a variety of frames and pick the ones that they liked the best. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 50 Lens f itters worke d with eac h child to ensure that t hey w ould be pleased with the way they w ould look i n their new gl asses - ensurin g they w ould wear them.

SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFIT (CB) FUND In Fiscal Year 2 021, Scripps H ealth co ntinued t o deepen its co mmitment t o phi lanthropy with its C ommunity B enefit F und. O ver the course of the ye ar, it awarded $ 138,500 in community gr ants t o programs i n San Diego. The funded projects ad dress some of S an Diego County's hi gh priority heal th needs, se eking to improve access t o vital health care services f or at risk populations, i ncluding t he homeless, economically di sadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $4.2 million to date. Programs funded during Fi scal Ye ar 2021 included: CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHE A) Funding provides low income, uninsured and be havioral he alth patients help obtain health care benefits, SSI and related services, w hile reducing uncom pensated care expenses at Mercy. This Medical Legal P artnership places Cons umer Center staff onsit e at S cripps M ercy H ospital w ithin t he Behavioral H ealth U nit and provides accessible legal assistance, i n addition to r eceiving direct referrals f rom other S cripps facilities.

CATHOLIC C HARITIES Funding provides sh ort term emergency shelter f or medically f ragile homeless patients upon dischar ge from S cripps M ercy Hospital, San Diego and C hula Vista. C ase Management and shelter ar e provided f or homeless patients discharged from Scripps 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 51 Mercy Hospital. While these patients no longer require hospital care, they do need a short -term recuperative environment. Patients who demonstrate a willingness to change receive one week in a hotel, along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and other self -reliance measures. The partnership seeks to reduce emergency room recidivism in this population and improve their quality of life. 2-1-1 COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE (CIE) 2-1-1 San Diego serves all of San Diego County, including the population served by Scripps, as the region's trusted primary connection to more than 6,000 community,health and disaster services in more than two hundred languages, 24 hours a day. In addition, 2-1- 1 San Diego operates a 2 -1-1 information hotline (Call Center) in the San Diego and Imperial County. Call Center services are designed to help members of the public (\"Clients\") to connect with community resources to assist Clients obtain medical care, mental health services, housing, food, clothing, government benefits, among other things. 2-1- 1 San Diego has expanded its referral services to include direct referral to Clients to community resources and access to the Community Information Exchange (CIE) Database. The CIE is a n ecosystem comprised of multidisciplinary network partners that use a shared language, a resource database, and an integrated technology platform to deliver enhanced community care planning. Care planning tools enable partners to integrate data from multiple sources and make bi -directional referrals to create a shared longitudinal record. By focusing on these core components, a CIE enables communities to shift away from a reactive approach to providing care toward proactive, holistic, person- centered care. San Diego's CIE supports approaches to whole- person health and addressing social determinants of health by coordinating care in the social ser vices sector and connecting to the health sector. When residents call 2 -1-1, the CIE matches them to appropriate health and social services and assists participating community partners with case management by developing a shared lon gitudinal record for each client, sending care coordination alerts, and enabling bidirectional referrals. The county 's centralized hub of information, ConnectWellSD, allows county staff and partners to share information and collaborate across county departments to deliver person- centered services. 2-1-1 San Diego has partnered with Scripps since 2011 to provide care coordination services to clients in need of health navigation support. A Scripps grant was not given in Fiscal Year 2021, but the project continues to serve Scripps Mercy Hospital patients,2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 52 focusing on homeless and housing insecure individuals and to assist in hospital discharge planning. COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE CIE 2021 SUMMIT Scripps attended the 4th Annual Community Information Exchange (CIE) 2021 Summit. The 2021 Summit was held virtually due to the continued impact of COVID -19. The three- day virtual conference centered on the theme, Leading with Community to Drive Systems Change , and explored how community -led model of a Community Information Exchange can promote racial health equity and inclusivity in health and social services. Core to the theme of the CIE Summit, this year's virtual event: The summit included tracks on governance and power, data ownership and technology and sustainability and policy. Explored community -based approaches for building a CIE. Incorporated thoughtful strategies for activating community voice. Emphasized representation of diverse perspectives of inform CIE design, implementation and data collection.2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 53 CANCER/ONCOLOGY Cancer is a term used to des cribe a group of diseas es that cause uncontrolled growth, invasion, and spread (metastas is) of abnormal c ells.

Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified cancer as a condition that many members of the community fear, particularly brain, colon and breast cancers. Participants also described barriers to receiving cancer screenings and treatment, including stigma surrounding a cancer diagnosis; fear about immigration status, particularly for asylum seekers; financial burdens, even for those with health insurance; and practical issues such as transportation to medical appointments. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, but many kinds of cancer can be pr evented or caught early. In 2019, cancer was the leading cause of death in San Diego County, responsible for 22.9 per cent of all underlying causes of deaths.17 17 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in San Diego County in 2019. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all r ankable causes, w hich are a subset of I CD-10's \" List o f 113 S elected Causes of D eath and Enterocolitis due t o Clostridium difficile.\" (CDPH, Center for Health Statistics, Office of Health Information and Research, Vital Records Business Intelligence System. Prepared by County of San Diego, HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, October 2021.) 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 54 In 2019, there were 5,018 deaths due to cancer (all sites) in San Diego County in 2019. The age-a djusted rate if death due to cancer was 135.2 deaths per 100,000 population in San Diego County.18 In 2019, 16.9% of all cancer deaths in San Diego County were due to lung cancer, 8.6% to colorectal cancer, 7.9% to pancreatic cancer, 7.6% to female breast cancer, 7.1% to prostate cancer, 6.4% to female reproductive cancers, 6.4 % to liver cancer, and 3.8% each to brain cancer and leukemia.19 In 2021 there will be an estimated 187,140 new cancer cases and 61,860 cancer deaths, an incidence rate of 404.6 average annual rate per 100,000 and a death rate of 140.3 average annual rate per 100,000 in California. (ACS, 2021). According to findings from the ACS 2021 Cancer Facts & Figures report, screening offers the ability for secondary prevention by detecting cancer early. It is estimated that nearly 1.9 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in 2021. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer am ong males (26%), follow ed by lung (12%) and c olorectal (8%) cancers. Among females, breast (30%), lung (13%), and colorectal (8%) cancers are the most common.20 According to findings from the ACS 2021 Cancer Facts & Figures report, cancer incidence rates ar e higher in males than in females for each racial/ethnic population, although rates are very similar in Asian/Pacific Islanders. The highest incidence rates are in blacks among males and in whites among females. Asian/Pacific Islanders have the lowest rates in both sexes. According to findings from the ACS Cancer Facts & Figures 2021 report, older age and bei ng female are the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Potentially modifiable factors as sociated with increased risk include weight gain after the age of 18 and/or being overweight or obese, menopausal hormone therapy, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity (ACS, 2021). The same report indicates that people with lower s ocioeconomic status have higher cancer death rates than those with higher socioeconomic status, regardless of demographic factors such as race/ethnicity.

Social inequalities, including communication barriers and provider/patient assumptions, can affect interactions between patients and physicians and contribute to miscommunication and/or delivery of subs tandard care (ACS, 2021). A recent study by the ACS found that at least 42% of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. \u2014 about 797,000 cases in 2021 \u2014 are potentially avoidable. This includes the 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco use as well as the 18% caused by a combination of excess body weight, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and physical inactivity (ACS, 2021). The Journal of Oncology Navigation & Sponsorship (JONS) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients. The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum, and often makes suggestions to help manage a patient from a holistic perspective (JONS, 2019). According to the NIH, clinical trials, a part of clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease by determining the safety and efficacy of a new test or treatment. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medical research and increases the health of future generations as well as improves disease outcomes, qual ity of life and health of trial participants (NIH, 2019). Scripps Health currently cares for on e-third of cancer patients in San Diego. Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs to educate people about the importance of early detec tion and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. Scripps Health is committed to providing care to all those in need. We serve an ethnically and economically diverse population including caring for traditionally marginalized and underserved with respect to health care. At Scripps, cancer care is more than just medical treatment, and a wide array of resources are provided such as counseling, support groups, complementary therapies, and educational workshops. Here are a few examples of Scripps c ancer programs during F iscal Year 20 21: SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER - REGISTERED NURSE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM Scripps provides a registered nurse, dedicated to assisting cancer patients and their families with navigating through the journey from diagnosis, treatment and survivorship from cancer. The focus is on education and outreach, as well as support services in this population. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 56 SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER - OUTPATIENT SOCIAL WORKER & LIAISON PROGRAM Scripps provides specially trained oncology social workers who understand the complexities of living with cancer and are dedicated to assisting cancer patients, along with providing education to health professionals and caregivers.

SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER - OUTPATIENT HEREDITY AND CANCER GENETIC COUNSELING PROGRAM Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center genetic counseling team helps individuals, and their families understand their cancer risks so that individualized cancer screening and risk reduction plans can be designed. In addition to providing information and guidance about genetic testing, genetic counselors interpret test results, advise families about their options and provide education and support. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SUPPORT GROUP S Through generous community support, Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center provides a wide range of support services and patient assistance programs. Throughout the system, oncology social workers or oncology nurse navigators provide counseling services and guidance regarding transportation, housing, homecare, financial, benefits, emoti onal concerns, and other issues. Free professionally facilitated support groups sponsored by the cancer center meet regularly at various locations to help patients and loved ones find support, guidance, and encouragement. Free educational workshops are held at various sites. D ue to COVID -19, meetings were suspended for the year as there was restricted access to the hospital . SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SURVIVOR 'S DAY Survivors Day is a time to recognize the nation's 15.5 million cancer survivors, to focus attention on issues of survivorship, and to acknowledge medical professionals dedicated to cancer treatment, research, and support services . National Cancer Survivors Day events are held in hundreds of communities nationwide throughout the month of June. Scripps holds a celebratory event at various Scripps hospital s each year to provide an opportunity for those that have battled cancer to come together and enjoy the company of friends, family and the camaraderie of fellow cancer survivors. Cancer survivors and other guests share inspirational stories , learn about advances in cancer treatment and research and enjoy the opportunity to connect with caregivers and fellow survivors. Each year the cancer survivor event s helps celebrate life, inspire those 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 57 recently diagnosed, offer support to family and loved ones and recognize all who provided support along the way. They also provide a forum for discussing the physical, financial and social issues that many cancer surviv ors face following completion of treatment. Due to COVID -19 these events were postponed. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER - POLSTER BREAST CARE The Scripps Polster Breast Care program sponsors the Young Women's Support Group which provide a venue for women under the age of 40 to come together, discuss issues relating to diagnoses and receive support. The groups are offered to women in the San Diego community. Topics related to breast health are also offered to the community . Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held due to restricted access to the hospital. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER LIFEGU ARD AND FIRST RESPONDERS ' CANCER SCREENINGS Scripps hosted a free skin cancer screening clinic for all state and local lifeguards , and first responders at the San Elijo State Beach Lifeguard Headquarters. According to the American Cancer Society, skin cancer is by far the most common form of cancer. More skin cancers are diagnosed in the U.S. each year than all other cancers combined. Dermatologists are starting to see the indirect effect of COVID -19 on people's skin with more advanced cases. For over 20 years , Scri pps Health has offered free screenings to lifeguards and other first responders as part of its community benefit program. After the lifeguard completes a form from the American Academy of Dermatology, they step into a screening room and a board- certified dermatologist and nurse conduct the screening.

In addition, 'cerebrovascular diseases' were the fourth leading cause of death, and essential hypertension and hypertensive renal diseas e' was the tenth. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors. RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE : Behaviors: Tobacco use, obesity, poor diet that is high in saturated fats, and excessive alcohol use. Conditions: High cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Heredity: Genetic factors likely play a role in heart disease and can increase risk. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cardiovascular disease is described below: The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify cardiovascular disease (including cerebrovascular disease/stroke) as a priority health issueaffecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to data presented in the HASD&IC and Scripps 201 9 CHNA, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are all risk factors that c ould lead to cardiovascular disease and stroke. About half of all Americans (47percent) have at least one of these three risk factors. Additional risk factors include alcohol use, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, diabetes and genetic factors . Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and Scripps Health 2019 CHNAs identified numerous barriers tocare for chronic conditions such as CVD, including: lack of access to healthyfood; transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as The World Health Organization defines cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels that include: Coronary heart disease Cerebrovascular disease Peripheral arterial disease Rheumatic heart disease Congenital heart di sease Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death in the U.S. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 60 unhealthy diet or minimal physical activity; poor medication management; unsafe neighborhoods; and unstable or complete lack of housing. According to data presented in the HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for coronary heart disease (CHD) in San Diego County increased 35.3% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 45 to 64 (41.9%) and those identified as A sian/Pacific Islander (55.1%). In 2019 the second leading caus e of death in San Diego County was diseases of the heart and cerebrovascular diseases including stroke were the third leading cause of death for San Diego County overall.21 In 2019, there were 1,620 deaths due to stroke in San Diego County.22 The age-a djusted death rate due to stroke was 42.4 per 100,000 population, which was higher than the HP2030 target of 33.4 deaths per 100,000. In 2019, there were 6,500 hospitalizations for stroke in San Diego County, wit h an age-a djusted rate of 177.5 per 100,000 population.23 In 2019, there were 2,828 stroke-r elated ED visits in San Diego County. The age-a djusted rate of ED visits was 76.7 per 100,000 population.24 According to 2020 CHIS data, 23.2% of San Diego County residents had ev er been diagnosed with high bl ood pressure, while 7.8% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 24.3% of San Diego County adults reported being obese. According to the CDC, heart disease (including CHD, hypertension and stroke) is the leading caus e of death for both men and women, and kills approximately 659,000 people each year (CDC, 2021). Heart disease is the leading c ause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. including Black/African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic, and white men. For women from the Pacific Islands, and Asian American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Hispanic women, heart disease is second only to cancer (CDC, 2021). In its 2021 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update, the AHA reported that CHD was responsible for 13% of all deaths in the U.S. in 2018, killing nearly 366,000 people.

According to blood pressure guidelines championed by the AHA and the American College of Cardiology, 47.3% of U.S. adults have hypertension (AHA, 2021). According to the AHA, it may be possible to prevent heart disease, stroke, and CVD by not smoking, engaging in daily physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet and body weight, and controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, andblood sugar (AHA, 2021). The CDC asserts that several health conditions, along with lifestyle, age and family history are risk factors that can increase an individual's risk for heart disease. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key riskfactors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking (CDC, 20 19). Not only is Scripps a nationally recognized heart care leader, consistently ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Hospitals for cardiology and heart surgery, but we treat more heart patients than any other he alth care provider in San Diego.

SCA i s not a heart at tack, it is caused by an abnormality i n the heart's el ectrical syst em that ca n easily be detected wit h a simple Electrocardiogram ( EKG ). Unfortunately, heart scr eenings ar e not part of a r egular, w ell- child exam or pr e-participation sp orts physical. T he first symptom of SCA co uld be death. A ccording t o the San Diego Medical Examiner r ecords, we lose at l east 12 youth annually to SCA. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 64 Scripps efforts began when a registered nurse at Scripps created the foundation af ter her 15- year-old son, Eric passed away from sudden cardiac arrest in 2009. Turning tragedy into an opportunity, the Paredes ' established the organization to prevent sudden cardiac arrest in school -age children and adolescents. As a sponsor for the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation, Scripps has supported more than 34,000 free cardiac screenings to local teens, including the homeless, uninsured, and underinsured through more than $120,000 in annual contribution since 2012 . In F iscal Year 2021 , Scripps made a $8,500 contribution to help pay for screenings. The support has funded free youth heart screenings, which have identified a total of 534 with cardiac abnormalities - 239 serious enough to cause sudden cardiac arrest. Typically, six youth heart screenings serving up to 1,000 individuals are hosted annually, however, after an 18- month pause the Eric Paredes Foundation hosted a small screening event in partnership with the California Highway Patrol at its Kearny Mesa headquarters where 191 youth were screened with seven cardiac abnormalities discovered - three serious enough to cause SCA. Cumulative data shows that an average of 57% of parents were not aware of the need to actively prevent SCA, with 68% unfamiliar with warning signs and risk factors. The following additional metrics were tracked: Teens Wit hout a Pediatrician/Family Doc: 29 Teens Who Use Community Clinic: 20 Scripps Volunteers: 7 Scripps Volunteer Hours: 54 Low to moderate Income Households: 51% Representation of Diverse Communities: 52% THE ERIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION - PRESCRIPTION FOR PREVENTION When screenings were paused due to the COVID -19 pandemic, Scripps support also helped the Eric Paredes Foundation pivot to develop Prescription for Prevention - a free, accredited training for primary care practitioners on incorporating a robust cardiac risk assessment in youth into their practice. In partnership with SDSU's Institute for Public Health and UC Irvine, The Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation produced the first CME/CNE on incorporating Sudden Cardiac Arrest prevention into primary care practices. Studies show cardiac consideration is an often- overlooked area of assessment. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 65 The training module reviews SCA warning signs, risk factors and recommended diagnostic testing protocol. The CME development was directed and narrated by Dr. John Rogers, Scripps Cardiologist and EP Save A Life Medical Director, and Scripps Health was instrumental in facilitating engagement in both a front -end needs assessment and in participation in the training module through direct communicat ion with P rimary Care P hysicians (PCPs) . Funding supported development and promotion of the training module on a local, state, and national level, and with the San Diego chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Preliminary data suggests that COVID - 19 can lead to heart damage and professional medical associations have released recommendations for cardiac assessment of student athletes who have been exposed before returning to play . This training supports a critical skill set for PCPs. The Scripps participation in live CME events/early Needs Assessment of total participants was 45%. To date, more than 400 PCPs have registered for the course with hundred more exposed to the program through live/online lectures and the CME now being hosted in their continuing education portal. Dr. John Rogers also made presentations to professional medical association conferences , including the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, Georgia Nurse Association, Society for Physi cian Assistants in Pediat rics and the 24th Annual San Diego School Health Conference. Pre/Post Test Performance average knowledge improvement was 40% -95%. Below are the pre and post correct answers to specific questions - powerful proof on how primary care physician's improved in their knowledge.

One in 300 youth has an undetected heart condition that puts them at risk. Smart Hearts Do not Miss A Beat is a new program that empowers young people to prevent sudden death at home, in school, on the field, at the doctor's office and un their future families, and workplaces. The program offers SCA 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 66 prevention learning for schoo l aged students to empower the next generation of life savers. This program served 1,200 youth, including dozens though Scripps SD Border AHEC Community Benefit Program that serves health pathway students in Sweetwater Unified High School District and its Health Career Occupation Program (HCOP) summer camp. The development of a classroom or independent learning module included a series of videos, activities, and quizzes for middle and high school students. Through a pre and posttest, students on average improved their knowledge from 50% to over 85%. The program goals are: Educate youth to recognize warning signs and family risk factors so they can be their own heart health advocate. Empower youth to use CPR and an automated external defibrillator (AED) and teach others the Cardiac Chain of Survival . Equip youth with leadership skil ls that prepare them to advocate for prevention in their communities .

STROKE CARE PROGRAMS On average, a stroke occurs ever y 40 seconds in the United States. More than 1,500 stoke deaths occurred in San Diego County in 2019, and about 15 people ar e hospitalized due to strok e every day. Sc ripps sponsors a wide v ariety of stroke related education and awareness programs. These include s upport groups and educ ation for stroke and brain injury sur vivors and their loved ones. Information and r esources are provided, along with skills to help reinforce inner strengths and learn self-c are strategies. Support groups offer the ability to dev elop encouraging peer relationships along with the goal of returning to and continuing a life of meaning and purpos e. Due to COV ID-19 these support groups were not held due to restricted access to the hospital. SAN DIEGO COUNTY STROKE CONSORTIUM Scripps Stroke Program par ticipates in the SD County Stroke Consortium, a county- wide stroke group, consisting of SD County Stroke Re ceiving Ce nter S troke Program Coordinators, Stroke Champions and Stroke Leadership. Additionally, the meeting is attended by Stroke Progr am M edical Directors and SD County leadership. The Str oke Consortium serves as a point of contact for continuity of stroke care in S an Diego County. Scripps Stroke Program dedicates time and resources to lead efforts to create and disseminate a unified com munity message urging San Diego County residents to seek emergency treatment when s uffering symptoms of a s troke. Scripps Stroke Progr am led a collaborative group including San Diego County EMS, San Diego regional American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, and the San Diego County Stroke Consortium in creating a united marketing cam paign. The slogan \"We are here for you. Every minute m atters\" accompanied by a graphic message was utilized to highlight the importanc e of seeking emergency treatment when experiencing stroke-like symptoms. The community collabor ation was also submitted for consideration at the 2021 International Stroke Conference. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 68 COLLABORATIVE SAN D IEGO COUNTY STROKE C ENTER COMMUNITY MESSAGING CAMPAIGN The San Diego County S troke Consortium ( Chaired by and of wh ich all Scripps He alth Stroke Programs p articipate) performed a collaborative SD C ounty Stroke Center Community Messaging campaign in May/June during the pandemic. The general point of the Consortium project was to reassure/remind community members of the importance of accessing 911 for stroke symptoms, to present for timely care, despite the ongoing pandemic. The Community Messaging Project was selected by the International Stroke Conference in March 2021 as a featured poster presentation. Additionally, the San Diego County S troke Consortium was chosen to present t hree additional p oster presentations at t he 202 1 International S troke Conference, al l of w hich contribut ed to knowledge of S D Community member's r esponse t o Stroke Care dur ing the C OVID -19 pandemic.

The group's goal is to educate and empower survivors. Attendees receive information and resources, reinforce inner strengths, learn self -care strategies, and develop encouraging peer relationships. A total of 30 people participated in the support group. Due to COVID -19 the group has transitioned to conference call group which has impacted the overall number of participants for the year . BRAINMASTERS : STROKE AND BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS SUPPORT GROUP In 2017, Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas launched a program to address the communication challenges of stroke and brain injury survivors. Brain Masters is an improvisational speaking group for adults coping with acquired brain injury. This fun, supportive and interactive group helps brain injury patients improve communication skills, think more quickly on their feet, and build self -confidence in a friendly, encouraging environment. Offered as a community benefit through Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Brain Masters is free and open to the community. Due to COVID -19 restrictions meetings were not held In F iscal Year 2021. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 70 DIABETES Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability . An analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2019 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cause of death. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of diabetes is described below: The HASD&IC and Scripps 2 019 CHNA continued to identify diabetes as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to data presented in the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA, rates of emergency department (ED) visits for diabetes in San Diego County increased 7.2% from 2014 to 2016, with the most significant increases in individuals ages 27 to 44 (13.9%) and those identified as Black/African American(15.1%). Focus groups and key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNAs identified numerous barriers to care for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, including lack of access to healthy food; lack of transportation; physical limitations or limited mobility; high health care costs; economic insecurity; low health literacy; poor health behaviors, such as unhealthy diet or lack of physical activity; poormedication management; unsafe neighborhoods and unstable or complete lackof housing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify diabetes as theseventh leading cause of death in the U.S., as well as the leading cause of kidney failure, non- traumatic lower limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults. There are three main types of diabetes - type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent from of diabeteswith about 90- 95% of the estimated 34 million people living with diabetes having type 2 diabetes. There are also an additional 88 million Americans withprediabetes in the U.S. - m ore than 1 in 3- have prediabetes but the majority of people do not know they have it. Prediabetes is a serious health condition where Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin -dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is the body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 71 your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes . In the United States, 34.2 million people have diabetes, which is more than 10% of the population, ac cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention. Another 88 million people have prediabetes. A 2018 study by CDC researchers estimated that the number of American adults diagnosed with diabetes will reach 60.6 million, or 18% of the population, by 2060. Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and can lead to other serious complications, such as kidney failure, blindness, and amputation of a toe, foot, or leg. People with diabetes spend more on health care, have fewer productive years, and miss more workdays compared to people who do not have diabetes. In 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes was $327 billion, including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in absenteeism, reduced productivity, and inability to work. In 2019, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in San Diego County.26 In 2019, there were 760 deaths due to diabetes in San Diego County overall. The age -adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 20.6 per 100,000 population.27 In 2019, there were 4,854 hospitalizations due to diabetes in San Diego County . The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization was 137.2 per 100,000 population.28 In 2019, there were 5,905 diabetes-related ED visits in San Diego County. The age-a djusted rate of diabetes-r elated ED visits was 169.1 per 100,000 population.29 According to 2020 CHIS data, 7.3% of adults living in San Diego County indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was lower than the state of California (10.9%). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 19.7% of San Diego County adults over 65 reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. According to 2018 CHIS data, 17.3% of San Diego County residents had been told by their doctor that they have pre- or borderline diabetes. 26 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using m ethodology es tablished by t he National C enter for H ealth S tatistics. D ata is based on \"underlying c au se of death\" informati on from all death certificates f iled in S an Diego County in 2019 . Causes are ranked accordi ng to the number o f deaths a ssigned to al l rankable causes, w hich are a subset of I CD-10's \" List o f 113 S elected Causes of D eath and Enterocolitis due t o Clostridium difficile.\" ( CDPH, C enter for Health S tatistics, O ffice of Health I nformation and Research, Vital Records Business Intelligence System. Prepared by County of San Diego, HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, October 2019.) 27 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, OSHPD Patient Discharge Data. 2019. SpeedTrack\u00a9 28 Ibid 29 Ibid 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 72 According to a report from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) titled the Burden of Diabetes in California, the age- adjusted prevalence of prediabetes among California adults ages 18 and over was 14.9% in 2017, and the age- adjusted prevalence of Type 2 diabetes was 8.3% (CDPH, 2019). Data presented by the United Health Foundation (UHF) indicates that, in 2019, diabetes prevalence in California was highest among individuals of other race (14.8%), followed by non- Hispanic Black individuals (14.4%), Hispanic individuals (12.4%) and multiracial individuals (11.0%) (UHF, 2020). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes isthe seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, the number of adultsdiagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last 20 years as the U.S. population has aged and become more overweight (CDC, 2020). The CDC's 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Report indicates that 89% of adults diagnosed with diabetes between 2013 and 2016 were overweight or obese, and 68.4% had high blood pressure. Factors that may reduce the risk of diabetes complications include having a usual source for diabetes care; meetingrecommended physical activity goals; managing or losing weight; managing A1C levels, blood pressure and cholesterol; and quitting smoking (CDC, 2020). The CDC estimates that 34.2 million people in the U.S. had diabetes in 2018. Of those individuals, 21.4% met laboratory criteria for diabetes but were not awarethey had the disease (CDC, 2020). According to the CDC, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and can lead to other serious complications, such as kidney failure, blindness, and amputation of a toe, foot, or leg. People with diabetes spend more on health care, have fewer productive years, and miss more workdays compared to peoplewho do not have diabetes (CDC, 2020). There are three major types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational. All three types share similar characteristics, the body loses the ability to either make or use insulin. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating dangerous blood sugar levels. Over time, this accumulation damages kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes and other organs. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is your body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or does not produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 73 Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. Clinical symptoms can include frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, sudden vision changes, unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, sores that are slow to heal, and increased number of infections. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle. Some facts about Type 2 diabetes: Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and California. More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 to 30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Nine out of 10 people with prediabetes do not know they have it. Some risk factors for developing diabetes include: Being overweight or obese Having a parent, brother or sister with diabetes. Smoking Having blood pressure measuring 140/90 or higher. Being physically inactive, exercising fewer than three times a week. A history of gestational diabetes If you are 65 years of age or older As incidences of new diabetes cases have become more prevalent among non- Hispanic Blacks coupled with existing cases being highest among American Indian and Alaska Native people, it is important to highlight and address health disparities in diabetes impacting minority populations. Factors including lack of access to healthcare, quality of care received, and socioeconom ic status have disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority populations in both the prevalence of this disease and health outcomes. SCRIPPS HEALTH DIABETES PROGRAMS Diabetes care is deeply embedded in the history of Scripps Health. In 1924, Ellen Browning Scripps founded the Scripps Metabolic Clinic in La Jolla next door to the original Scripps M emorial Hospital. Just two years earlier, the discovery of insulin had sparked a revolution in the treatment of diabetes, commonly called metabolic disease at the time, which had previously been hopelessly untreatable and deadly in most cases. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 74 Scripps is making every effort to help patients and our communities with prediabetes reverse course and lead healthier lives. Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institu te, by the numbers in 2020: 6,600: Patient consultations 2,839: Visits made by Project Dulce care managers 987: Visits for women enrolled in the diabetes in pregnancy program 266: Hospitalized patients followed with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM ) including 30% with COVID -19 142: People enrolled in the diabetes prevention program 17: Active studies with 759 participants $4 million : Funding awarded for 6 new research projects During Fiscal Year 2021 , Scripps sponsored the following diabetes management programs and initiatives: WOLTMAN FAMILY DIABETES CARE AND PREVENTION CENTER IN CHULA VISTA The Woltman Family Diabetes Care and Prevention Center in Chula Vista serves one of San Diego's communities hit hardest by the diabetes epidemic. Nearly 40 percent of patients admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital Chula Vista, and nearly 32 percent of patients in the heart catheterization lab, have diabetes. County statistics tell us that the rates of death, hospitalizations and emergency room visits are twice as high in Chula Vista compared to all of San Diego County. The Center has added critical classroom space to meet the high demand for services and offers a full range of wellness, prevention, diabetes education, and nutrition services and endocrinology specialty visits in English and Spanish . In response to the pandemic, visits are available live or via telehealth and all group classes will continue being offered as live long- distance virtual group classes. PROJECT DULCE Scripps Whittier has led the way in developing comprehensive, culturally sensitive diabetes care management programs to provide care for people in high-risk, underserved communities through Project Dulce, which uses nurses, dieticians and specially trained educators known as \" Promotoras \" to counsel diabetes patients while educating them to support others with diabetes within their own cultural groups. Diabetes management classes have been adapted for Hispanic, African American, Filipino and Vietnamese populations, and are taught in the patients' native languages. The program is team based and incorporates the chronic care model. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 75 Recognized by the American Diabetes Association ADA and 1 of 3 programs endorsed by the Centers for Medicaid and the American Diabetes Association as a best practice model , Project Dulce has been active in communities across San Diego for the past 26 years . Informed by the Chronic Care Model, Project Dulce's nurse -led multi -disciplina ry team provides clinical management while peer educators also known as Promotoras deliver culturally appropriate self -management education to adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. This innovative program combines state of the art clinical diabetes management with proven educational and behavioral interventions. One of the primary components of the program is recruiting peer educators from the community to work directly with patients. These educators reflect the diverse population affected by diabetes and help teach others about changing eating habits, adopting exercise routines and nurturing their wellbeing to manage this chronic disease. In Fiscal Year 2021 , Project Dulce provided 2,551 diabetes care and education visits for low income and underserved individuals throughout San Diego . RETINAL SCREENING PROGRAM It is estimated that every 24 hours, 55 people will lose their vision because of diabetic - related eye disease ( diabetic retinopathy) even though 95 percent of diabetic blindness could be prevented with early diagnosis and treatment. For more than a decade, Scripps has been screening people in underserved communities for diabetic retinopathy using a mobile camera. Our free or low -cost eye exams diagnose individuals at high risk for reti nal damage and help patients get treatment and referrals to specialists. Due to COVID -19 the screenings were not conducted due to COVID -19 restrictions . DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM The UCLA Center for Health Policy and Research recently published data that revealed nearly half of California adults have prediabetes or diabetes. While the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute has been providing the best care for people with diabetes for decades, the Institute has continued to expand care with the Scripps Di abetes Prevention Program (DPP), which is a year -long intervention where people with prediabetes meet weekly for 16 weeks, then monthly thereafter. The DPP is an intensive lifestyle behavior change intervention program that has been proven to prevent diabetes in large- scale national studies . Scripps program is part of the National Diabetes Prevention Program, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program is considered a Medicare benefit for prediabetic patients, and a doctor's referral is not required. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 76 The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has been thoroughly evaluated in NIH sponsored randomized controlled trials and has been found to decrease the number of new cases of diabetes among those with prediabetes by 58%. Among people over age 60, there was a 71% reduction in new cases. After a brief pause at the start of the pandemic, Scripps launched a virtual version of its Diabetes Prevention P rogram in which small cohorts meet online once a week for the first four months, then twice a month. The structured research- based program is effective and provides the support needed to make healthy habits that will last for life. Sessions focus on topics such as diet and exercise, managing stress and overcoming barriers. Each participant is also paired with a lifestyle coach who helps them set and meet their goals. In Fiscal Year 2021 , 217 patients attended 82 Scripps DPP orientation sessions. Much of the effort is focused on the South Bay for the Latino population, which is at higher risk of acquiring diabetes than their white counterparts. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 77 HEALTH RELATED BEHAVIORS Health related behavior is one of the most crucial elements in people's health and well - being. Its importance has grown as sanitation has improved and medicine has advanced. Diseases that were once incurable can now be prevented or successfully treated. Health related behaviors, such as immunization, smoking cessation, improved nutrition, increased physical acti vity, oral health, and injury prevention, have become important components of long-term life. The risk factors for many chronic diseases are well known. An unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and substance use have been cited by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/chp ) as important health behaviors that contribute to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and others including mental disorders and oral diseases. The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA identified ten top health and social needs in San Diego County. These ten social determinants are: access to care, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, unintentional injury and violence, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer , and chronic conditions. Key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA suggested several health improvement strategies to address the he alth issues identified for San Diego County. These strategies include behavioral health prevention and stigma reduction; education on disease management and foodinsecurity; integrating physical and mental health care; better coordination ofcare; greater cultural competence and diversity; and engagement of patient navigators and case managers in the community. According to 2020 CHIS data, 23.2% of San Diego County residents had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, while 7.8% had borderline high bloodpressure. In addition, 24.3% of San Diego County adults reported being obese. In 2018, 17.7% of San Diego County adults reported that fresh fruits and vegetables were only sometimes available in their neighborhood (CHIS, 2018). In California, the self -reported obesity rate in 2020 was 30.3%. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for healtheducation as a tool for reducing obesity rates (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2021). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer (CDC, 2021).2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 78 The HHSA's Live Well San Diego (LWSD) 3 -4-50 initiative identified three behaviors (poor diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) that contribute to four chronic conditions (cancer, heart disease/stroke, Type 2 diabetes and pulmonarydiseases), which result in more than 50 percent of deaths worldwide. In 2019 , 50 percent of all deaths in San Diego County were attributed to 3-4- 50 conditions. According to the NIH National Library of Medicine (NNLM), nearly 9 out of 10U.S. adults struggle with health literacy, which involves the information andservices that people need to make well -informed health decisions. Limited health literacy is associated with poor health outcomes, including hospital stays and EDvisits; medication errors; difficulty managing chronic diseases; and skippingpreventive services, such as flu vaccines (NNLM, 2021). Understanding that personal behaviors play a significant role in an individual's overall health status, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs that help people take charge of their own, and their families , health. During Fiscal Year 2021 , Scripps sponsored several health behavior modification programs . COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES Community members participated in a variety of classes, prevention lectures and support groups. Approximately 1, 000 attended these programs held at the Chula Vista Well Being Center. This year's numbers continued to be impacted due to the COVID -19 Pandemic. In person support groups, classes, activities ceased mid-March 2020. Many in-person activities have not been able to reconvene due to the large group restrictions and/or being a vulnerable population due to age and/or health condition. A few groups have been able to transition to a conference call or virtual platform to continue meeting. HELPING PATIENTS NAVIGATE POST DISCHARGE SERVICES Helping Patients Navigate Post Discharge Services are offered by Scripps Mercy Hospital Well Being Center to patients and their family to decrease the risks of readmission, keep patients on a healthy pathway and to increase patient continuity. Services and assistance are provided for 30 days post discharge and up to one year for any social work or nurse case manager referral and/or patients with the following conditions: Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Pneumonia, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Total Knee or Hip Replacement, and COVID -19. Comm unity patient post discharge services include home visits, assistance with follow up physician visits, phone calls, providing community and social service resources, and application assistance (medical insurance, SDI, housing, SNAP, Mama's Kitchen), and a referral and/or 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 79 appointment to a local community clinic or the Scripps Advanced Care Clinic. These services are currently only available at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista and San Diego. The following are metrics tracked by the program: 813 patient referrals were received (30 Day and Social Work) 716 patients were contacted/reached (this includes 30- day follow up and Social Work referral patients) 97 patients - unable to reach, deceased, declined follow -up services, language barrier 70 patients were readmitted (source: caregiver, EPIC) COMMUNITY H EALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) Scripps i s a partner w ith CHIP a nd collaboratively w orks on a resident l eadership m odel that has empowered 700+ ci tizens across the C ounty ( and bey ond) t o affect c hange in a wide range of co mmunity heal th areas su ch as publ ic safety, acce ss to healthy f oods, and increased opportunities f or physical activity.

OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) AND BRIDGE PROGRAM Opioids are not benign ther apy and opioid dependence is often a health care-a cquired condition. A recent JAMA study concluded that 6% of opioid- na\u00efve patients who receive opioids following surgery, even minor surgeries, are still using opioids 90 days later . Although opioids remain an integral part of acute post -operative pain management, the data demonstrates risk for creating long- term dependence. The U.S. uses 80% of the world's opioid supply despite having only 5% of the population.80 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) attributes 90 deaths per day to opioid overdoses. The economic cost to U.S. society of nonmedical use of prescription opioids hasbeen estimated t o exceed $70 billion annually, including health care, workplace, and criminal justice costs. In 2019, there were 927 ED visits (27.7 per 100,000 population) and 483 hospitalizations (14.4 per 100,000) related to opioid misuse in San Diego County. Percent change from 2017 to 2019 is 22.1% for ED visits and - 21.3% for hospitalization. Males are 1.8 times more likely to visit the ED for opioid misuse than females and 2.0 times more likely to be hospitalized for opioid misuse than females in 2019. For race/ethnicity, Non -Hispanic Black has the highest rate for ED visits (43.0 per 100,000), followed by non- Hispanic White (35.9 per 100,000). For age groups, 27- 44 had the highest ED visits for opioid misuse (57.2 per 100,000), followed by 18- 26 years old (41.9 per 100,000).30 California Hospital Compare (CHC), a nonprofit organization that provides Californians with hospital performance ratings, named all four of Scripps Health's hospitals to its 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll. Scripps is the only health care organization in San Diego County to be recognized on the inaugural statewide list. The 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll recognizes 53 California hospitals for their progress and performance in promoting safe and effective opioid use, providing treatment for patients with opioid use disorder and providing access to naloxone to prevent opioid overdoses. According to preliminary state data, 5,363 Califor nians died of an opioid-r elated overdose in 2020.31 CHC recognized Scripps for taking a variety of approaches to address overuse of opioids among its patients. For patients being discharged from an emergency department visit or hospital stay, Scripps has created educational videos that it makes available for viewing and has also set opioid prescription quantity limits at discharge. In addition, some Scripps hospital emergency departments have implemented medication-assisted therapy, in which specially licensed ER physicians can administer medications as a bridge for patients with opioid use disorder until they can receive further care. The Opioid Stewardship Program (OSP) at Scripps is combatting this national epidemic by working with physicians to decrease the number of opioids prescribed to patients and educating patients on pain management. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers . In addition, Scripps also has 30 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, OSHPD Patient Discharge Data. 2019. SpeedTrack\u00a9 31 California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard, 2020 2022 Scripps H ealth Community Benefit P lan & R eport2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 81 opened three drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year - round access to dispose of unused, unneeded , or outdated medications . The data below shows national and state trends and how they compare t o Scripps. The metrics also show data for co- prescribing opioids with benzodiazepines. According to the CDC's chronic pa in guidelines , clinicians should avoid prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently whenever possible, as both cause central nervous system depression and can decrease respiratory drive. Concurrent use has also shown significantly increased (up to four times) risks for overdose death compared with opioid prescription alone. Scripps is monitoring this metric to decrease opioid- benzo co- prescribing. Opioid prescribing, comparing 2018 to 2019 (last year of available national data): National - 10% reduction California - No reduction Scrip ps Clinic - 10.4% reduction (data includes oncology and high- risk surgeries) Scripps Coastal - 26.5% reduction Opioid prescribing at Scripps Clinic, comparing 2018 to 25% in opioid with at Scripps in opioid prescribing 42% reduction on opioid co- prescribing with benzodiazepines CALIFORNIA BRIDGE PROGRAM Scripps has received state grants at each of its Scripps hospitals from the California Bridge Program and The Center at Sierra Health Foundation to remove barriers to identifying and treating patients with opioid use disorder and provide Medication- Assisted Treatment (MAT). Co mbined with other recent grants for Scripps Opioid Stewardship Program, Scripps has been awarded almost $1 million to help prevent and treat opioid addiction. Scripps actively promotes MAT access for patients in the form of buprenorphine. The Bridge Progra m aims to help hospitals and health centers expand patient access to treatment for opioid use disorder, including on- the-spot medical treatment and coordinated outpatient care, while MAT aims to reduce the stigma of opioid addiction and increase provider support for medication assistance in treating addiction. All together, these state programs have awarded Scripps $935,000. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 82 As part of the grant, Scripps now has Bridge counselors to help patients with opioid addiction. Bridge counselors are certified through the California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Professionals (CAPP) or the California Association for Drug/Alcohol Educators. They meet patients in the emergency department and other inpatient areas of both Scripps Mercy campuses to provide rapid evidence- based medication-assisted treatment. They also connect patients directly to continued treatment in the community. The California Bridge grant also enabled Scripps to hire Substance Use Disorder Service n urses (SUDS) to facilitate treatment and entr y into a community -based MAT program. Scripps deploys specialized nurses certified in addiction to see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team in facilitating safe detox treatment while hospitalized. They identify patients who are at risk or are currently experiencing withdrawal from alcohol and other addictive substances. SUDS nurses evaluate patients who meet certain criteria and work directly with the nurse and physician to ensure the patient is adequately me dicated to control symptoms of withdrawal. SUDS nurses at Scripps function in a proactive and reactive role at all Scripps hospitals and collaborate with community resources, including Family Health Centers of San Diego to provide MAT, McAlister Institute for detox beds and the Betty Ford Center for outpatient care. SPONDYLITIS ASSOCIATION Scripps Health provides meeting space to the Spondylitis Association of America (SAA). This is a non- profit organization founded in 1983 to address the needs of people affected by spondyl arthritis . Since that time, SAA has been at the forefront of the fight to promote medical research, educate both the medical community and general public and advocate on behalf of the people they serve. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital . LIVE WELL SAN DIEGO VIRTUAL 5K AND FITNESS CHALLENGE Scripps Health joined Live Well San Diego as a recognized partner on December 13, 2016. Live Well San Diego is a vision for a region that is Building Better Health, Living Safely and Thriving . It aligns the efforts of individuals, organizations , and government to help all 3.3 million San Diego County residents live well.

That number is expected to reach 1 million by 2030, in alignment with state trends showing an aging population doubling within t hat time. In 20 19, there wer e 504,267 r esidents ages 65 and ol der in San Diego County representing 14.5% of the population. Between 2019 and 2024, it is anticipated that San Diego County senior population will grow by 22.4%.32 Aging concerns ar e defined as t hose con ditions t hat pr edominantly affect se nior pe ople who are 65 an d older such as A lzheimer's di sease, P arkinson's, d ementia, f alls and limited m obility.

A summary o f the m agnitude and prevalenc e of a ging conditions are below: The 2019 HASD&IC and Scr ipps CHNA identified aging concerns as one of the top health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals. The 2019 HASD&IC and Scripps CHNA identified physic al and non-physical barriers to care. Seniors accessing health care c an be particularly difficult. When seniors can no longer drive, finding reliable, affordable transportation c an be challenging. Seniors mos t often have limited income and are constantly shifting their financial prior ities between paying for housing, food, or costs associated with seeking health care. High cost of medications, co-pa ys and deductibles were cited as creating financial barriers to accessing health care. Physical barriers to care, such as limited mobility, h earing or vision issues may also create challenges for seniors needing additional assistance. For those who do not speak English as a first language, language can also be a barrier to access ing care. After discharge from a hospital stay, seniors may hav e inadequate support at home to recover well and follow-u p car e is hard for seniors to locate and 32 SpeedTrack Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau 202 2 Scripps H ealth Community Benefit P lan & R eport85 secure. These needs identified by the community overall spoke to the overwhelming need to increase awareness of community and social support programs and services for this particularly vulnerable group. Per the 2019 CHNA, conditions that disproportionally affect older adults were identified as a high priority health need through both community engagement events and the secondary analyses. Community engagement participants most often descri bed aging concerns in relation to the SDOH that affect seniors such as: Access to fresh food Economic insecurity (especially food insecurity and housing unaffordability) Social isolation and inadequate family support (lack of companionship, anxiety, depression, hopelessness. Inadequate family support or support at home to recover, maintain one's health, or manage their medications including ordering refills, picking up prescriptions, and taking the right dose of medications at the right time, can be challenging for older adults who do not have adequate support). Transportation (lack of acces sible or reliable transportation options to and from appointments, to go grocery shopping, or just socialize with others) In 2019, Alzheimer's disease was the fourth leading cause of death in San Diego County for all age groups. D ementia is a clinical syndrome of the decline in memory and other thinking abilities. It is caused by various diseases and conditions that result in damage to brain cells and lead to distinct symptom patterns and distinguishing brain abnormalities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgements, communicate, and carry out daily activities such as bathing and eating. A n estimated 84,405 adults aged fifty-f ive and older are living with some form of dementia and this number is projected to increase to more than 115,000 by 2030. A lzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease in the nation, with associated costs higher than those of both cancer and heart disease. Researchers estimate that between informal caregiving, out-o f -pocket costs, and Medicaid and Medicare expenditures, the lifetime cost for a person living with dementia is over $320,000.33 In 2019, the top leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in San Diego County were (in rank order): diseases of the heart, cancer, Alzheimer's 33 The Alzheimer's Project San Diego Unites for a Cure and Care. County of San Diego HHSA, April 2 019.

One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and each fall doubles the chance of falling again. These injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficulty with everyday tasks or living independently. In 2015, the direct medical costs associated with fall injuries totaled more than $50 billion (CDC, 2019). OLDER ADULTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS The prevalence of older adults experiencing homelessness represents an ongoing significant concern. San Diego is now the ninth most expensive city in the U.S. (2019). The Elder Index , developed by UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research, reports 41% of San Diego's seniors do not have enough income to pay for basic housing, food, healthcare, and transportation. Meanwhile, government housing programs are experiencing extreme waiting lists and intake tools fail to prioritize the elderly. These factors, combined with San Diego's housing crisis, are intensifying senior homelessness, as evidenced by San Diego's most recen t 2020 Point in Time Count. National reports confirm the number of homeless older adults (55 and over) is projected to grow from 170,000 in 2017 to 225,000 by 2026, with the fastest growth among those 65 and over. The number of newly homeless in San Diego doubled in 2020. According to San Diego's 2020 Point in Time Count, one out of four of San Diego's homeless adults is over the age of 55. Among this group of unsheltered seniors, 88% became homeless in San Diego County and 43% are experiencing homelessness for the first 34 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using m ethodology es tablished by t he National C enter for H ealth S tatistics.

SCRIPPS ADVANCED CARE CLINIC The program provides intensive, proactive, medical , and social services to adults living with multiple chronic diseases. Understanding that diseases can impact all aspects of a person's life, the program treats not just medical issues, but also the psychos ocial, economic , and spiritual aspects of care. The Advanced Care Clinic interdisciplinary, patient centered team helps optimize patient health through an evidence- based extensivist clinic model that assists with care coordination and patient advocacy across health care and home settings. To date 245 patients have been served, 45% reduction in hospitalizations, 49% reduction in 30- day readmissions and 49% reduction in ED visit rate. In addition, the program coordinates non -clinical issues. Table 4.2 display s several types of psychosocial services referrals.

The Board of Supervisors approved the Aging Roadmap initiative in December 2014 and later voted in support of an implementation timetable. Participants 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 88 began meeting in early 2016 to craft a regional roadmap to address the disease, focusing on cure, care, clinical, and public awareness , and education initiatives. Dr. Michael Lobatz from Scripps Health is a leading participant of this initiative as chairperson of the Clinical Round Table and is a member of the Steering Committee. Alzheimer's Project partners have collaborated to develop the Physician Guidelines for Screening, Evaluation, and Management of ADRD in 2016 to assist primary care physicians in supporting those impacted by dementia. In 2019, Kaiser Permanente, Scripps Clinic, Sharp Healthcare and UCSD Geriatric Emergency Department began incorporating the recommended actions described in the Physician Guidelines for Screening, Evaluation, and Management of ADRD into their daily operations. This type of systemic adoption of best practices ensures sustainable quality care. VIRTUAL STANDING STRONG FALL PREVENTION WEBINAR As part of National Fall Prevention Awareness week in September 2021, Scripps partnered with the County of San Diego Health and Human Services and the San Diego Fall Prevention Task Force on free, virtual event s to learn more about what individuals can do to prevent falls. Falls are the leading cause of injury related emergency department visits for older adults. Scripps instructed five one- hour classes and the topic s are listed below . The Scripps event served as the official kick -off event for Fall Prevention Awareness week with nine presentations delivered virtually . http://www.sandiegofallpreventi on.org/ . The following were some of the topics provided: Fall Prevention: Reducing Your Risk and Fears A Matter of Balance Sample Class Head to Toe Work Out Gentle Chair Yoga Healthy Bones for Better Balance FALL PREVENTION AND HOME SAFETY WORKSHOPS Many older adults experience concerns about falling and restrict their activities. Scripps Social Workers and nurses lecture on ways to reduce fall risk, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Balanc e classes are designed to help build balance, posture and coordination through strengthening and balance exercises. This important aspect to healthy living for seniors provides education on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through safety measures in the home. Scripps Physical Therapy department and Physical Therapy school volunteers provide fall risk assessments. Seniors may attend from all 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 89 over the San Diego County region. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. A MATTER OF BALANCE : MANAGING CONCERNS ABOUT FALLS Scripps educates older adults on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through sa fety measures in the home. An 8- week program and lecture series provide practical strategies to manage falls, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Scripps was chosen as a pilot site to test a new virtual edition of the A Matter of Balance program with results being used to launch the new virtual evidence- based version in January 2021. Nineteen virtual classes were conducted in F iscal Year 2021. SENIOR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING PROGRAMS Each month a variety of senior programs are held in partnership with local senior centers, churches, and senior housing. The following programs are conducted as part of Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista San Diego Border Area Health Education Center and Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program. These senior health chats are designed to provide health education to the older adult community. A total of 69 seniors have participated in these monthly sessions. These presentations include a variety of health and age- related topics that include Heart Health, Understanding Osteoporosis, Parkinson's, Cold vs. Flu , Depression: Senior Connections, Fall Prevention and Balance, Food and Nutrition, Vitamins and Minerals, Cancer Health Talk and a variety of prevention and healthy lifestyle topics. These presentations are facilitated by various health care professions and residents. Presentations are offered in English and Spanish. Topics are all chosen by the seniors themselves to meet their local needs. Also, the health chats provide an interchange between the community members and our medical residents and other health care professionals to foster healthy lifestyles and health prevention. The program is conducted in collaboration with Norman Park Center, Congregational Towers Senior Living. St. Charles Nutrition Center serving seniors and Kimball and Morgan Towers Senior Living. Family Medicine Residents rotate through these programs to learn more about geriatric medicine, health and wellness and overall public health and community training. Due to COVID -19 the group has transitioned to a conference call group which has impacted the overall number of participants for the year. PARKINSON 'S LSVT (LEE SILVERMAN TRAINING ) BIG EXERCISE : Scripps provides a maintenance class for those who have completed the LSVT BIG Exercise protocol. This class is taught by a physical therapist and is designed for 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 90 Parkinson's patients to improve strength and mobility for a healthier life. Due to COVID - 19 meetings were not held due to restricted access to the hospital. SCRIPPS HEALTH GERIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ACCREDITATION BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS (ACEP) Across the country, seniors account for nearly 18% of emergency department visits , and that number is expected to rise. All four Scripps Health emergency departments have been accredited b y the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) as geriatric emergency departments, a distinction that recognizes excellence in providing specialized care to elderly patients. The San Diego Senior Emergency Care Initiative (Initiative) aims to improve older adults' experience and outcomes in EDs by supporting geriatric emergency department accreditation for EDs across the San Diego region by 2021. These EDs will provide care that is tailored to the unique needs of the over -60 population by modifying the physical environment, adding senior -specific protocols, and providing staff with special training. T he Initiative is a public -private partnership involving the County, the West H ealth Institute, and the region's major health systems. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 91 OBESITY, WEIGHT STATUS, NUTRITION, ACTIVITY & FITNESS Obesity is an important health need due to its high prevalence in the U.S. and San Diego. Although it is not a leading cause of death, it is a significant contributor to the development of other chronic conditions. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Obesity, Weight Status, Nutrition and Activity & Fitness is described below: The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify obesity as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. According to 2020 CHIS data, 23.2% of San Diego County residents had ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, while 7.8% had borderline high blood pressure. In addition, 24.3% of San Diego County adults reported being obese. According to a new report released in 2019 by the San Diego Childhood Obesity Initiative, 34%, or nearly 1 out of every 3children in San Diego County's schoolswere overweight or obese. These rates vary by grade, with 5th graders having the highest rates of overweight and obese children (36%) compared to 7th graders (34%) and 9th graders (33%). I n examining trends across longer periods of time, overweight and obesity prevalence among children in San Diego County appears to be leveling off and even declining slightly. For example, a 2005 UCLA study estimated 36% of children in San Diego County were overweight or obese, with that number decreasing to 35% in 2010. Based on these data, childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in 2018 has decreased by two percentage points since 2005. This small decrease from 36% to 34%, however, would represent approximately 8,600 fewer students across public school districts who were overweight and obese in 2017- 2018. More information can be found at, www. San Diego County oi.org . Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. Overweight and obesity ranges are determined using weight and heigh t to calculate a number known as \"body mass index\" (BMI). For adults: BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. BMI of 30 or higher is consider ed obes e. For children and adolescents (ages 2 -19): BMI at or above the 85t h per centile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered overweight BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered obese. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 92 In California, the self -reported obesity rate in 2020 was 30.3%. Prevalence of obesity decreased as education levels increased, highlighting the need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), 2021). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer (CDC, 2021). Accordin g to the article Social and Environmental Factors Influencing Obesity, obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial or ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status. Higher odds of obesity are attributed to multiplefactors, including environments experiencing deprivation, disorder, or high crime; proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are perceived as more affordable; and reductions in occupational and transportation- related physical activity (Lee, Cardel & Donahoo, 20 19). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes , and certain types of cancer. Obesity is largely categorized as a secondary diagnosis in hospital discharge data. When examining inpatient hospital discharge data with obesity as a secondary diagnosis, it was found that the most common primary diagnosis of those patients was nonspecific chest pain in ages 25- 64, abnormal pain for those ages 15- 24, and those over 65 years their primary diagnosis was osteoarthritis, septicemia followed by congestive heart failure. Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels of \"overweight\"and \"obesity\" the risk for the following conditions also increases: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast and colon) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Even before the COVID -19 pandemic, 30% of local children were considered obese. According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association , child and teen obesity rates further increased over the past 18 months of the pandemic . 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 93 Obesity is addressed through general nutrition and exercise education and resources provided at Scripps as well as programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for heart disease, cancer, diabetes , and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. During Fiscal Year 20 21, Scripps engaged in the following obesity prevention and treatment activities: SAN DIEGO CHILDHOOD OBESITY INITIATIVE The San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative ( COI) was established in 2006 and is a private public partnership with the mission of reducing and preventing childhood obesity through policy, systems, and environment change. The COI is facilitated by UC San Diego Center for Community Health and funded by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA). The initiative has a health domain which engages healthcare stakeholders to support and advocate for healthy systems, policies , and environmental changes. DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) A large clinical trial concluded that people with prediabetes could reduce their likelihood of developing diabetes by 58- 70 percent if they lost just 5 -7 percent of their body weight. The Diabetes Prevention Program is a scientifically validated lifestyle intervention- based model. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) promote widespread adoption of the DPP due to its demonstrated effectiveness. Scripps was recognized by the Centers for Disease Control as a national DPP provider and rolled out the program to patients and community members in 2016. Scripps aims to decrease the incidence of Type 2 diabetes by managing a major diabetes risk factor, obesity in the underserved, ethnically diverse populations by testing the effectiveness of lifestyle curriculum. The program uses trained lifestyle coaches and a standardized curriculum; participants meet in groups with a coach for 16 weekly sessions and six to eight bimonthly follow -up sessions. Participants must have prediabetes and be overweight to enroll. No physician referral is required, although many physicians do refer their patients to this valuable resource. Orientation sessions are held in Spanish and English throughout the county. REDUCING CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN SOUTH BAY 5210 PROGRAM Scripps also addresses childhood obesity at the high school level in San Diego's South Bay communities through its partnership with the Promise Neighborhood initiative, 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 94 which imp lements activities related to the national 5210 campaign. The message is to promote a healthy lifestyle ( 5 Servings of Fruits and Vegetables, 2 Hour Screen Time Limit, 1 Hour of Physical Activity and 0 Sugary Drinks) per day. This four -session series is designed to increase knowledge and behaviors regarding a healthy lifestyle. The series includes hands -on activities and demonstrations. The foundation of this project began in 2013 with a partnership wit h the Promise Neighborhood Initiative and Castle Park Elementary School to increase education and awareness about healthy lifestyles and to help the students pass their yearly physical education requirements . Scripps has continued to enhance and develop the series. During FY21 there was a total of 36 participants from Chula Vista High Schools and students from Health Careers Occupational Program (HCOP) Camp Scripps. As a result of activities, lesson plans and advocacy for healthy living, the amount of physical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables by the youth has increased. Student responses via the 5210- assessment survey showed pre-test knowledge was 63% and post -test knowledge improvement rate of 89 % after participating in the 5210 sessions. Due to COVID -19 these sessions were held virtually. LA MAESTRA FAMILY CLINIC, INC La Maestra Family Clinic, Inc. joined the City Heights Wellness Center (CHWC) collaborative partnership with Scripps Mercy Hospital and Rady Children's Hospital as the lease holder of the Wellness Center starting September 1, 2016. Since its inception in 2002, the City Heights Wellness Center has been a dynamic, community -based program developed by Scripps Mercy Hospital and Rady Children's Hospital, working with residents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and self -sufficiency skills. Multiple not -for-profit and governmental organizations, philanthropic foundations and grassroots groups have joined the effort conducting health promotion and educational activities for community residents. A unique aspect of the City Heights Wellness Center is the Teaching Kitchen that is known throughout the community as a place where residents and providers come together to cook, discover , and communicate in a safe and trusted environm ent. La Maestra Family Clinic brings a new perspective to the partnership as a community health center and primary care provider serving the culturally diverse populations within the City Heights community. La Maestra is committed to maintaining the collaborative nature of the partnership and continue s to work with current CHWC agencies as well as look for opportunities to expand health promotion services. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 95 The Scripps M ercy Supplemental N utrition Program f or Women, I nfants a nd Children (WIC) was collocat ed in the Wellness Center but has recently m oved service s to a suite at the Price Entities bui lding.

There is tremendous focus on maternal illness and death, and infant health and survival, including infant mortality rates, perinatal and other infant deaths. According to a New York Times article, \"Huge Racial Disparities Found in Deaths Linked to Pregnancy ,\" May 2019, African American, Native American , and Alaska Native women are about three times more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy, compared to white women in the United States. Maternal and infant health issues include: Alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances during pregnancy, which are major risk factors for low birth weight and other poor outcomes. Exceptionally low birth weight associated with preterm birth, spontaneous abort ion, low pre -pregnancy weight and smoking. Infant death rates are highest among infants born to young teenagers and mothers 44 years and older. Being pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, is only a small portion of a woman's life. Unintended pregnancy, either mistimed or unwanted at the time of conception, accounts for an estimated 49 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. These pregnancies are associated with increased morbidity, as well as behaviors linked to adverse health. Women who can plan the number and timing of their children experience improved health, fewer unplanned pregnancies and births, and lower abortion rates. HIGH RISK PREGNANCY High Risk Pregnancy can be the result of a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops during pregnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high- risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after delivery and might require special monitoring throughout the pregnancy. Risk factors: Advanced maternal age: increased risk for mother's 35 years and older. Lifestyle choices: smoking, alcohol consumption, use of illegal drugs. Medical history : prior high-risk pregnancies or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions, family history of genetic conditions. Underlying conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy. Multiple pregnancy. Obesity during pregnancy.97 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Maternal and Child Health & High - Risk Pregnancies are described below for San Diego Coun ty: In 2019, 33,880 live births received early prenatal care in San Diego County, which translates to 88.2% of all live births in the region.37 In 2019, 141 infants in San Diego County died before their first birthday. The infant mortality rate was 3.7 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.38 There were 3,336 preterm births in San Diego County in 2019, representing 8.7%of all births countywide. 39 According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), prenatal c are improves pregnancy outcomes, and is among the most frequently used health care services in the U.S. Experts recommend pr enatal care with early, ongoing risk assessment, and tying content and timing to individual needs and risk status (NCHS, 2018). Live Well San Diego's (LWSD) Report Card on Children and Families, 2019 identified the following barriers to use of prenatal care: financial barriers, such as lack of health insurance; context of care, such as biased treatment from providers or low cultural competence; and access issues, such as transportation, difficulty obtaining an appointment or inconvenient hours (LWSD, 2020). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health- relat ed factors known to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes include tobacco or substance use, infectious diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure, certain medications, depression, unsafe environmental or workplace conditions, radiation, and weight gain during pregnancy (CDC, 2021). Factors associated with preterm birth include maternal age, race, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, substance use, stress, prior preterm births, carrying more than one baby, and infection (CDC, 2021). According to March of Dimes data, the rate of preterm births in the state of Californi a was 8.8% in 2020 \u2014 lower than the national average. However, racial disparities have worsened in California, where the rate of preterm birth among Black women is 44% higher than the rate among all other women ( March of Dimes, 2 021). 37 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit (2020), Maternal, Child, and Family Health Services Statistics 2011-2 019. 38 Infant mortality refers to the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births 39 Preterm birth refers to births prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation. 2022 Scripps H ealth Community Benefit P l an & R eport2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 98 Scripps Health continued to enhance prenatal education for low -income women in San Diego County in Fiscal Year 2021. The following are some examples: COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES Offered more than 120 maternal child health classes throughout San Diego County to enhance parenting skills.

They interact with other mothers and are led by the instructor. Babies are weighed at the beginning and end of the group to assess how much milk they are getting. Due to COVID -19 this group continued to meet virtually as of March 2020. Due to this transition the participation of this group was greatly impacted. CENTERING PREGNANCY , SCRIPPS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY Raising healthy families and caring for the next generation of San Diegans before they are born help create a healthier community for years to come. The Scripps Family Medicine Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista is providing access, education, and clinical services to nearly 400 pregnant women in south San Diego County. The goal of the program, \"Improving Perinatal Care for Underserved Latina Women - Healthy Women, Healthy Babies ,\" is to provide access to perinatal care for underserved Latina women to improve birth outcomes. The program applies the principles of the Center Health Care Institute and focuses on changing the way patients experience their care through assessment, education, and group support. Centering Pregnancy is the institute's model devoted specifically to improving maternal and child health and has been shown to result in increased prenatal visits, greater levels of breastfeeding and stronger relationships between mothers and their healthcare providers before, during and after pregnancy. Women who gave birth reported an enhanced prenatal experience, gained less weight throughout their pregnancy , and showed improved healthcare knowledge. Services include home visits, referrals, data entry, follow up phone calls, and other support services. Home visiting is offered together with Family Medicine Residency and parenting education. Since COVID- 19, this program has been offered via telemedicine. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH NURSING STUDENTS Scripps Perinatal Education program supports local nursing students with the opportunity to observe prenatal educational classes. This critical aspect of nursing education allows the hours and information to meet their clinical rotation requirements in maternal child health. Due to COVID -19 the clinical rotations were not held due to restricted access to the hospital. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 100 SCRIPPS MERCY 'S SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN , INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) The Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WI C) was established as a permanent program in 1974 to safeguard the health of low -income women, infants , and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk. Scripps Mercy Hospital is one of five regional organizations that administer the state funded WIC program. The program serves six locations conveniently situated near community clinics and/or hospitals in the central San Diego area. WIC targets low income pregnant and postpartum women, infants , and children (ages 0 to 5 years). Scripps Mercy WIC serves on average 6,200 women and children annually, 44 percent in the City Heights community. In City Heights clients are 91 percent Hispanic and include pregnant and postpartum women (24%), infants (20%) and children (56%). In F iscal Year 2021, the program provided nutrition services, counseling and food vouchers for 70,450 women and children in South and C entral San Diego. The Scripps Mercy WIC program plays a key role in maternity care by reaching low - income women to promote prenatal care, good nutrition and breastfeeding during pregnancy and offer lactation support (one on one and group), as well as breast pumps , pads, and other supplies during the postpartum period. In April 2020, in response to the State -wide public health restrictions, all WIC appointments went virtual including the education and counseling sessions. Once WIC eligibility requirements were met, food vouchers were issued automatically to the WIC EBT card. As a result, the WIC Program experienced a higher rate of participant engagement and satisfaction with on- line services; Barriers to childcare and transportation were no longer issues for client participation. MIRACLE BABIES Scripps Health partnered with Miracle Babies on their virtual 5K Walk/Run. The mission of Miracle Babies is to unify families with their sick newborns through financial assistance and supportive services to reduce pregnancy complications through prevention, education, and research. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 101 UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AND VIOLENCE According to Healthy People 20 30, \"unintentional injuries and violence- related injuries can be caused by a number of events, such as motor vehicle crashes and physical assault can occur virtually anywhere.\" Unintentional injury and violence were identified as a priority health need in the community engagement process of the 2019 CHNA . Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. In 2019 , accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for San Diego County overall. The deaths associated with unintentional injuries are significant ; yet represent only a small part of a much larger public health problem. Hospitalization data is a better measure of the injury problem than the death data alone. Unintentional injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian related, firearms, fire/burns, drow ning, explosion, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances) choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electric current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and injuries at work, are one of the leading causes of death for San Diego County residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk taking; the physical environment both at home and in the community; access to health services and systems created for injury related care; the social environment, including individual social experiences. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of unintentional injury and violence is described below: The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify unintentional injuryand violence as one of the top priority health conditions among San Di ego County hospitals. According to data presented in the HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA, rates of ED visits for motor vehicle injuries in San Diego County increased 9.3% from 2014 to 2016, while deaths due to motor vehicle injuries increased 1.1%. Focus groups conducted as part of the HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA emphasized the importance of a safe environment as a contributor to good2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 102 health. Lack of a safe environment may encourage physical inactivity, which contributes to chronic health conditions. In 2019, accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for San Diego County overall.40 Between 2015 and 2019, more than 5,800 San Diegans died from injuries that were not self-i nflicted. In 2019, there were 927 ED visits (27.7 per 100,000 population) and 483 hospitalizations (14.4 per 100,000) related to opioid misuse in San Diego County. Percent change from 2017 to 2019 is 22.1% for ED v isits and -2 1.3% for hospitalization. Males are 1.8 times more likely to visit the ED for opioid misuse than females and 2.0 times more likely to be hospitalized for opioid misus e than females in 2019. For race/ethnicity, Non-H ispanic Black has the highest rate for ED visits (43.0 per 100,000), followed by non-H ispanic White (35.9 per 100,000). For age groups, 27-4 4 had the highest ED visits for opioid misuse (57.2 per 100,000), followed by 18-2 6 years old (41.9 per 100,000).41 Unintentional injuries are one of the leading causes of death for San Diego County residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Drugs, alcohol, vehicles, falls, guns and suicide continue to be leading causes of deaths investigated by the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office. Under law, the County Medical Examiner's Office investigates all \"unnatural\" deaths that occur by accident, homicide, or s uicide due to traumas or overdose, or undiagnosed or sudden unexpect ed natural causes. San Diego County's Medical Examiner's Office release both mid-year statistics comparing t he first six months of 2020 to 2019 in its 2019 annual report. L ooking at mid-y ear figures, the department investigated 1,751 deaths through June this year compared to 1,674 in the same months last y ear, a 5% increase. The Medical Examiner's Office investigates deaths that occur by accident, homicide, or suicide due to trauma or overdose, or undiagnosed or sudden, unexpected natural causes. In cases where a person dies a natural death and is under a physician's care, that phys ician will certify the death and the person does not then go to the Medical Examiner for further i nvestigation. 40 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using m ethodology es tablished by t he National C enter for H ealth S tatistics.

SpeedTrack\u00a9 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 103 Within the accidental death category, unintentional overdose deaths due to illicit drugs, prescription medication and alcohol toxicity increased by 21% from 320 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 387 the first six months of this year. Of those accidental overdoses, fentanyl -caused deaths increased by 126% comparing those same six months where there were 69 deaths in 2019 and 156 cases for the first six months of this year. Most often, overdose deaths from fentanyl aretraced to counterfeit pills that resemble oxycodone or alprazolam, 2020 San Diego County Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force. There was also a decrease of 5% in number of suicides, 198 this year compared to 209 in the same six months last year. Firearms were the leading method of death in 76 of the 198 deaths by suicide this year. Homicides increased by 14% for the first half of the year, 59 compared to last year's 52. In this category, firearms were again the leading method of deaths, 32 of the 59 deaths. For all of 2019, accidental deaths overall comprised 50% of all department investigations. Within that category, unintentional overdoses from drugs \u2014both prescription or illegal \u2014and alcohol were, at 39%, the leading cause of death. Accidental falls followed at 33% and then traffic -related fatalities at 19% were next as outlined in the department's annual 2019 year -end report. Deaths from falls increased by 12% with 545 cases in 2019 compared to 488 in 2018. Blunt head trauma and hip/femur fracture were the leading cause of death in falls. Traffic -related deaths decreased by 5% from 2018 which had 316 deaths while 2019 saw 301 deaths. CDPH and Department of Health Care Access and Information injury data indicates that, in 2020, unintentional injuries caused more than 1,500 deaths, nearly 130,000 million ED visits, and more than 27,500 hospitalizations in San Diego County (CDPH, 2020; Sp eedTrack, Inc., 2020). In 2019, unintentional injury was the third leading cause of death across all agegroups in the U.S., accounting for more than 173,000 deaths. Unintentional injurywas the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people ages 1 to 44, the third leading cause of death for ages 45 to 64, and the seventh leading cause of death for those over the age of 65 (CDC WONDER Online Database, 2021). The Status of Methamphetamine Use in San Diego County The Methamphetamine Strike Force, known as the Strike Force, was established by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors in 1996. Today the Strike Force is a collaboration at federal, state and local levels, with contributions from more than 70 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 104 participating agencies. The annual MSF Report Card provid es data from 2020 on leading indicators of meth problems . According to the Methamphetamine Strike Force 2021 Report C ard, a total of 722 San Diegans died with methamp hetamine in their system and another 576 people died due to prescription drugs in the region last year . The new figure far exceeds the previous record set in 2019 when 546 deaths were reported. The 2021 Meth Report Card highlights the following data points : 566 men and 156 women died with meth in their system. There were 16,309 emergency room visits due to methamphetamines in 2019 compared to 13,020 in 2018. Data from 2020 will be available in 2022. A total of 4,740 people were admitted to County -funded treatment programs due to meth abuse last year, vs. 6,591 in 2019. 56% of adult arrestees tested positive for meth in 2020, compared to 59% theprevious year. 8% of juvenile arrestees tested positive for meth in 2020, compared to 11% in2019. Arrests for selling and possession of meth decreased to 7,211 compared to11,313 in 2019. San Diego Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force The San Diego Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force (PDATF) is a Countywide initiative comprised of key stakeholders, community members and local experts working together to decrease the harms associated with the misuse of prescription drugs in San Diego County. Misuse of prescription drugs in San Diego County continues to be a growing problem. Many prescription related overdose deaths are unintentional. The 2021 Prescription Drug Report Card also includes statistics on fentanyl. It shows that a record 462 people died from fentanyl in 2020, compared to the 151 the year before that. The prescription drug and opioid deaths reported in 2020 more than double the 275 fatalities in 2019. In ad dition to deaths, the Prescription Drug Report Card tracks additional key indicators of opioid misuse in the region. It also shows the following (most recent years for which numbers are available vary by statistic): 430 men and 146 women died from prescription drugs. 7,723 visits to local emergency rooms in 2019, compared to 6,162 in 2018. Datafor last year is not yet available.2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 105 Ten percent of 11th graders reported prescription drug use in 2019, the same percent as in 2017. The survey is done every two years. Forty -six percent of adults arrested reported misusing prescription drugs in 2020, the same as the year before. Scripps Health continued to address unintentional injury and violence and the following are some examples: OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) Cal Hospital Compare (CHC), a nonprofit organization that provides Californians with hospital performance ratings, has named all four of Scripps Health's hospitals to its 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll. Scripps is the only health care organization in San Diego County to be recognized on the inaugural statewide list . The 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll recognize d 53 California hospitals for their progress and performance in promoting safe and effective opioid use, providing treatment for patients with opioid use disorder and providing access to naloxone to prevent opioid overdoses. According to preliminary state data, 5, 363 Californians died of an opioid- related overdose in 2020. CHC recognized Scripps for taking a variety of approaches to address overuse of opioids among its patients. For patients being discharged from an emergency department visit or hospital stay, Scripps has created educational videos that it makes available for viewing and has also set opioid prescription quantity limits at discharge. In a ddition, some Scripps hospital emergency departments have implemented medication-assisted therapy, in which specially licensed ER physicians can administer medications as a bridge for patients with opioid use disorder until they can receive further care. The Opioid Stewardship Program has spearheaded multiple projects at Scripps to educate patients and providers about the risks of opioids and the benefits of alternative multi- modal pain management options to reduce opioid use. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers. Scripps has drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year -round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications. Additionally, Scripps provides a range of non- pharmaceutical pain management therapies, including music and pet therapy, ice and heat treatment, spiritual care and more. CAR SEAT PROGRAM Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla Emergency Department provides car seats to patients who have been in an automobile accident and their child's car seat has been rendered unsafe to use.

SAN DIEGO HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE AND PROJECT LIFE Scripps has partnered with the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force and Project Life to offer \"soft rooms\" at all Scripps hospital facilities except Scripps Green Hospital. These soft rooms will be available to Project Life on a moment's notice to serve as a safe, confidential environment for law enforcement to interview victims of human trafficking and for service providers to connect with the victims with emergency shelter and community resources. The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force receives 3,000 to 8,000 human trafficking victims every year in San Diego County. Approximately 80 percent are born in the United States. SAVING LIVES THROUGH STOP THE BLEED CAMPAIGN Whether from a bullet wound or other traumatic injury, severe blood loss can kill in just five minutes. However, one- fifth of trauma deaths, the leading cause of death for Americans under age 46, could be prevented by sta unching the bleeding. Scripps doctors are getting behind the national Stop the Bleed campaign. Supported by the American College of Surgeons, the Department of Homeland Security and numerous police departments . It aims to teach bystanders how to properly place pressure on a wound or apply a tourniquet in an emergency. Scripps providers participate in this program by teaching nonmedical audiences to control life -threatening bleeding until professional medical help arrives. The 90- minute course includes a presentation and practice on applying direct pressure, wound packing and using a tourniquet. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held due to restricted access to the hospital.

Because of the broadness of this health issue, it is often difficult to capture the need for behavioral health services with a single measure. Behavioral health is an important health need because it impacts an individual's overall health status and is a comorbidity often as sociated with multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and asthma. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of behavioral health is described below: The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify behavioral health as a priority heal th issue affecting members of the communitiesserved by Scripps. The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA identified behavioral health a top priority health issue both in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement events. The community engagement events conducted in the 2019 CHNA, identified thatwhile San Diego has innovative programs to address mental health, residentsface challenges in accessing timely, consistent mental health care. Care was described as especially difficult to obtain when the mental health issue was not considered an emergency. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA conducted a community engagement analysis and across all types of community engagement focus groups, key informant interviews, and the online survey . Behavioral health issues were identified as both prevalent and debilitating in the community. In the online survey, behavioral health was ranked as the health condition having the greatest impact on the health and well -being of San Diego County residents and as the second most impactful condition when health conditions and social determinants of health were combined (only accessto care ranked higher). In addition, 63% of survey respondents indicated that they believe behavioral health is worsening in San Diego County. Respondents were also asked to rank specific behavioral health conditions having the greatestimpact in San Diego. Mental Health can be defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merely the absence of disease\". Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 110 The top seven conditions identified were as follows: 1. Alcohol Use Disorder 5. Opioid Use 2. Mood Disorders 6. Suicide and Suicide Thoughts/Ideation 3. Substance Use Disorder 7. Self -Harm or Self -Injury 4. Anxiety An analysis of mortality data in San Diego County found that in 2019, intentional self-harm (suicide) was the ninth leading cause of death.42 In 2019, there were 4945 ED visits (147.7 per 100,000 population) and 7861 hospitalizations (234.9 per 100,000) related to mood disorders in San Diego County. Percent change from 2017 to 2019 for ED is -1 6.7% and for hospitalization is -8 .7% 43 In 2019, there were 865 ED v isits (25.8 per 100,000 population) and 171 hospitalizations (5.1 per 100,000) r elated to cannabis us e in San Diego County . Percent change from 2017 to 2019 for ED is 29.2% and for hospitalization is 54.0%. The age most impac ted is 18-2 6 with 62.5 per 100,000 population for ED visits and 15.1 per 100,000 for hospitalizations in 2019.44 In 2019, there were 861 ED visits (25.7 per 100,000 population) and 379 hospitalizations (11.3 per 100,000) related to opioid overdose in San Diego County. Percent change from 2017 to 2019 is 16.8% for ED visits and 19.6% for hospitalizations. For s ex, males (34.6 per 100,000 population) are 2 times more likely to go to the ED for an opioid overdose than females. For rac e/ethnicity, Non-H ispanic Black have the highest rate for ED v isit (39.8 per 100,000) followed by Non-H ispanic White (31.2 per 100,000). For age groups, 27-4 4 have the highest rate for ED visits (49.1 per 100,000), followed by 18-2 6 for ED visits (45.1 per 100,000).45 42 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading c auses of death using methodology es tablished by t he National C enter for H ealth S tatistics.

In San Diego County, 12.4 people per every 100,000 die from suicide annually, and approximately 10% of all adults seriously consider committing suicide.46 SUICIDE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS Suicide is a major complication of depression and a leading cause of non- natural death for all ages in San Diego County, second only to motor vehicle accidents. According to the County of San Diego, Health and Human Services Agency the number and rate of people who died by suicide in San Diego County d eclined slightly in 2020. In 2020, which included the first 10 months of COVID -19, 419 died from suicide, 10 fewer than the previous year's total of 429. However, the consequences of the pandemic have boosted demand for mental health services. To view the complete report, visit www.spcsandiego.org . Among the 2020 report's findings: 1.After a period in which the annual suicide rate remained steady from 2013 to 2018, the suicide rate dropped by 10% since 2018. 2.The 2020 suicide rate is the lowest since 2010. 3.While t he suicide numbers decreased in 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic was likely a contributor factor. 4.Suicides continue to outnumber homicides by a large margin. 5.There were about three and a half times as many male suicides as there were female suicides. 6.53% of all suicides are white males. 7.White middle -aged males, who are divorced or widowed, have the highest rates of suicide. 8.Males are more likely to use firearms while females are more likely to use drugs. 9.The San Diego County suicide continues to decrease below the National rate as is now approaching the California State rate. 46 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology es tablis hed by t he National C enter for Health S tatistics.

Prepared by County of San Diego, HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, October 2021) 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 112 In 2010, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) launched a suicide prevention planning process, which was formed by the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the California Strategic Plan on Suicide Prevention. Scripps is a member of the Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP), which collaborates with the county on this initiative. For more information on the status of suicide and suicide prev ention in San Diego County: 20 20 Report Card. https://www.San Diego County hip.org/initiatives/suicide- prevention- council/reports - resources/ The Report Card brings together the most recent data available from multiple sources (for the years 201 5 through 2020) to present a profile of suicides for all ages in San Diego County. Information from the County Medical Examiner, the Access & Crisis Line, hospital emergency departments, student self -reports, suicide prevention awareness campaigns and suicide prevention training pr ograms are presented to provide a more complete understanding of the status of suicide and efforts to prevent them in San Diego County . In 2019 there were 3,029 emergency department discharges for self - inflicted causes in San Diego County which is a rate of 90.4 per 100,000 people. The percent of students who seriously considered suicide in in 2020 was 14.5%.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 113 hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. The Behavioral Health Inpatient Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital helps patients and their loved one's work through short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Behavioral Health Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, aspayment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In Fiscal Year 2021 , the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $6.3 million loss in total operations, with 4.1 million of this loss being captured in Medi -Cal/CMS and Charity Care . In Fiscal Year 2021 , 1.9 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health outpatient program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) and expand outpatient behavioral health offerings to the population served. Collaboration with hospital partners such as NAMI, the Family Health Centers of San Diego, the McAlister Institute and Hazelden Betty Ford highlight Scripps commitment to the community we serve. Scripps has also received grant money as part of the Behavioral Health Pilot Project to embed substance use counselors in the emergency department to facilitate linkage to medication assisted outpatient programs. SCRIP PS MERCY AND FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP Scripps Mercy has established an initiative with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to create a more robust behavioral health care system for Medi -Cal patients that receive care at S cripps Mercy H ospital . The goal is to strengthen the continuum of integrated primary and mental health services for patients discharged from various hospital settings (medical and behavioral health inpatient and emergency care) through a variety of timely patient engagement strategies including the expansion of community - based behavioral health services adjacent to the hospital. The partnership involves placing social workers and Substance Use D isorder (SUD) counselors in e mergency departments to assist with diversions to community resources or to mental health care as appropriate. It is important to involve patients in appropriate outpatient care before their behavioral health issues become acute, preventing return s to the Emergency Department. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 114 MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH SERVICES , A-VISIONS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM Behavioral Health Services at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in partnership with the San Diego chapter of Mental Health of America established the A -Visons Vocational Training Program (social re habilitation and prevocational services for people living with mental illness) to help decrease the stigma of mental illness and offer volunteer and employment opportunities to persons with mental illness. This supportive employment program provides vocational training for people receiving mental health treatment, potentially leading to greater independence. This year, Behavioral Health Services continued participating in the A -Visions program. Since its inception, 636 inquiries have come in, 165 of these resulted in qualified candidates with 101 volunteers and 54 employees thus far. Currently, there are a total of 20 active candidates: 19 employees and one volunteer who participate in this supportive employment program. The average length of employment for the 54 employees is 8.6 years, with a range of 2 months to 14.7 years. The current paid employees have been employed between 2.2 years to 14 .3 years, with the average length of employment being 8.5 years. A -Visions participants have been employed on a casual/per diem basis by Scripps Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Services, Emergency Services, Nursing Research, Human Resources, Access, Behavioral Health, Credentialing, Labor and Delivery, Laboratory , Medical Staffing, Performance Improvement, Spiritual Care and Palliative Care Services. Paid A -Vision's candidates typically limit their work to eight hours per week, which allows them to maintain eligibility for the disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral healthcare that supports their work. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND THE SUICIDE PREVENTION COUNCIL The San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council (SPC) is a collaborative community - wide effort focused on realizing a vision of zero suicides in San Diego County. Its goal is to prevent suicide and its devastating consequences in San Diego County. Since 2010, with support from the County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services, CHIP provides direct oversight and guidance toward the implementation of the Suicide Prevention Action Plan. The core strategies of the S uicide Prevention Council are: Enhancing collaborations to promote a suicide- free community Conducting needs assessments to identify gaps in suicide prevention servi ces and supports2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 115 Disseminating vital information on the signs of suicide and effective help-seeking Providing resources to those affected by suicide and suicidal behavior Advancing policies and practices that contribute to the prevention of suicide PSYCHIATRIC LIAISON TEAM (PLT) The Psychiatric Liaison Team is a mobile psychiatric assessment team. Clinicians provide mental health evaluation and triage services to accurately assess patients and provide them with the best and safest community resources to promote ongoing care. The team aims to help people adhere to treatment plans, reduce hospital readmission rates, relieve symptoms and ultimately ensure the long- term stabilization of the patient's mental health. Scripps will continue to provide a dedicated Psychiatric Liaison Team at all Scripps Hospitals Emergency Departments and urgent care settings (Rancho Bernardo and Torrey Pines). MI PUENTE : \"MY BRIDGE \" TO BETTER CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute received a $2.4 million study grant from the NIH's National Institute of Nursing Research in 2015 to evaluate Mi Puente, a program at Scripps Mercy Chula Vista hospital that uses a \"nurse + volunteer\" team approach to help hospitalized Hispanic patients with multiple chronic diseases , reduce their hospitalizations and improve their day -to-day health and quality of life. Individuals of low socioeconomic s tatus (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics the largest U.S. ethnic minority group are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (\"cardiometabolic\" e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health in this population contribute to striking disparities in disease pr evalence and outcomes. A behavioral health nurse provides in- hospital coaching to patients, who are then followed post discharge by a volunteer community peer mentor to assist them in overcoming barriers that may interfere with achieving and maintaining good health. Mi Puente aims to improve continuity of care and address the (physical and behavioral) health needs of the at -risk Hispanic population. This program holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations . BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM (BHIP) IN DIABETES Many people find that the day -to-day tasks associated with having diabetes such as repeating testing one's blood sugar, planning/preparing meals, getting enough physical activity and rem embering to take medications can lead to chronic stress among those living with diabetes, particularly when coupled with other life stressors. The general 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 116 sense of feeling overwhelmed by diabetes is referred to as diabetes distress, and when prolonged or l eft unaddressed, it can lead to negative health outcomes. Scripps Diabetes Care and Prevention has two Diabetes Behavioral Specialist on staff who form part of the Diabetes Behavioral Health Integration Program (BeHIP). BeHIP is an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to managing the emotional and behavioral needs that often leads to burnout of individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The co- location of medical and behavioral health services in the same facility allows for a convenient, warm hand- offs from physician s or educators to a behavioral health specialist. It also affords opportunities for physicians, diabetes educators and others to receive consultation on behavioral health concerns, and in turn, more comprehensively address the multi -faceted needs of their patients with diabe tes. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES AT LOCAL SCHOOL -BASED CLINICS Scripps Family Medicine Residency and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well -Being Center have partnered to offer clinical training opportunities for Master Social Work students in training from San Diego State University at Southwest and Palomar High Schools. These students work with local providers that address the mental health needs of vulnerable adolescents. A variety of mental health issues are present for local high school students. Many of these issues include depression, anxiety and suicide related concerns. The program works to improve overall mental health care for local students through a school -based clinic. Due to COVID -19 the schools were closed for several weeks and then transitioned to a virtual setting. This program will begin in the new school year 2022. PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES : BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Patients are referred from Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, for assistance with a wide variety of behavioral health needs including addiction, loss, anxiety , and other mental health issues. The Well -Being Center offers weekly counseling and/or refers patients to local mental health counseling services. These services are offered remotely due to COVID -19. ALCOHOLIC ANONY MOUS Scripps H ealth provides meeting space for members of Alcoholic Anonymous. A fellowship of people who share their experience, strength , and support of each other. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held due to restricted access to the hospital. GRIEF RECOVERY AFTER A SUBSTANCE PASSING (GRASP) Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of GRASP. GRASP was founded to help provide sources of help, compassion and most of all, understanding, for families 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 117 or individuals who have had a loved one die because of substance use or addi ction. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held due to restricted access to the hospital . NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) SIBLINGS SUPPORT Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of NAMI Sibling Suppor t. This is a confidential support group for siblings of person with mental illness and adult children of parents with mental illness. Due to COVID- 19 the meetings were not held due to restricted access to the hospital. SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE LOSS - SAN DIEGO CHAPTER Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of the Survivors of Suicide Loss - San Diego Chapter. The organization reaches out to and supports people who have lost a loved one to suicide. The goal is to give survivors a place where they can be comfortable expressing themselves, a place to find support, comfort, resources and hope in a judgment- free environment. These meetings were cancelled due to COVID -19 and restricted access to the hospital. SCRIPPS DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESOURCES There are more than 25 million illicit drug users in the US. There are an estimated 136.9 million current drinkers of alcoholic beverages and of those, approximately 23 percent binge drank in the last 30 days and 6.3 percent are considered heavy drinkers. It is estimated there are 8.7 million under -age drinkers. Substance use, particularly opioid misuse, is a health c risis that has reached epidemic proportions both nationally and locally. According to the CDC drug use was already a big problem before the coronavirus pandemic . Overdose deaths increased by 30% nationally during the pandemic. SCRIPPS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDE R SERVICE (SUDS) NURSES Aware of the impact drugs and alcohol can have on our community, Scripps has developed innovative ways to treating this destructive disease. Scripps has deployed specialized nurses certified in addiction; they see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team to help facilitate a safe detox while hospitalized. The Substance Use Disorder Service (SUDS) nurses act in a proactive and reactive role in all Scripps hospitals, helping to identify patients who are at risk, or are currently experiencing withdrawal from addictive substances. This mobile group of specially trained drug and alcohol resource nurses provide education, interventions and discharge placement assistance to patients in the Scripps hospitals. The resource 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 118 nurses work directly with the nursing staff at each of the hospitals in search of patients who may be at risk for alcohol/drug withdrawal and assist with implementing a standardized protocol withdrawal process. Scripps has changed the way we deliver drug and alcohol treatment by collaborating with others to deliver a continuum of care that improves the health of our community. When patients need additional care, Scripps has linked itself to t wo separate treatment programs designed to meet the community needs. B ETTY FORD CENTER In 2016, Scripps partnered with the Betty Ford Center, which expanded its drug and alcohol treatment programming into San Diego. This treatment center brings world-renowned alcohol and drug rehab to more people through weekday and weeknight outpatient services. F AMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF SAN DIEGO Family Health Centers of San Diego provides an array of services, including outpatient drug and alcohol treatment along with medication- assisted treatment and harm reduction programs. Their services also include individual counseling and one- on-one support, educational sessions, HIV resting, Hepatitis B & C testing and treatment. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 119 SOCIAL DE TERMINANTS O F HEALTH Per Section 2, Community H ealth Needs A ssessment ( CHNA), i n addition to the he alth needs t hat w ere identified in the CHNA, s ocial det erminants o f health (SDOH ) wer e also identifie d in all the co mmunity en gagement ac tivities.

FOOD INSECURITY Food Insecurity is the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified food insecurity and access to healthy food as a social determinant impacting San Diego's priority health needs . Studies demonstrate that hunger significantly impacts health. Lack of access to healthy food, often due to availability and cost, are stressors that contribute to diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other behavioral health issues in a myriad of ways: Food insecure adults with diabetes have higher average blood sugar . Food- insecure adults are more likely to be obese. Food insecurity is significantly more prevalent in adults with mood disorders. Food insecurity is associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts and substance use in adolescents. Food insecure seniors have a significantly higher likelihood of heart disease,depression, and limited activities of daily living. Food- insecure adults delay the purchase of food to buy medicines . According to an Issue B rief from the San Diego Hunger Coalition51, the COVID-1 9 pandemic an d economic cr isis bot h increased t he strain on existi ng nutrition insecure populations an d increased t he number of i ndividuals ex periencing nutrition insecurity, many of w hom experience d nutrition insecurity f or the first time and had little knowledge of av ailable resources. 50 Gundersen C, Ziliak JP (2015) \"Food Insecurity and Health Outcomes\". Health Affairs. 2015. 34(11): 1830-1 839 51 San Diego County Food Insecurity Estimates, https://sdhunger.org 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 121 In addition, the San Di ego Hunger Coali tion report highlights approximately one in three San Diegans experience nutrition insecurity or are unable to provide three nutritious meals per day for themselves and/or their families . This is up from an estimated one in four San Diegans in 2019, which was the lowest rate since the Great Recession and a 10-year low for the county . Of those experie ncing nutrition insecurity, 28% were newly nutrition insecure in 2020, while 73 % were already struggling to meet their needs before the COVID -19 pandemic. Nutrition insecurity disproportionately impacts those who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). The most recent US Census American Community Survey data indicates that, while an estimated 25% of the population in San Diego was nutri tion insecure in 2019, 44% of the Black population and 37% of the Indigenous population were nutrition insecur e. Similarly , 44% of Hispanic or Latinx people across races were nutrition insecure . Nutrition insecurity also disproportionately impacts people with disabilities. In 2019, 40% of people with disabilities were nutrition insecure. It is anticipated these disparities have worsened during the pandemic. In 2020, due to the pandemic, the percent of the population experiencing nutrition insecurity in San Diego County increased from 25% in 2019 to a peak of 39% (1,291,000 people) in April 2020, then leveled off to 30% (1,015,000 people) in November 2020. As of June 2021, nutrition insecurity continues to affect one in three people in San Diego County. Nutrition insecurity is even worse among children. As of March 2021, 284,500 children, or 40% of children in San Diego County were nutrition insecure. Nutrition insecurity is also pervasive among seniors, with 146,000, or 30% of seniors in San Diego County facing nutrition insecurity. San Diego County March 2021 Nutrition Insecurity Rates Total nutrition insecure population: 1, 035,000 This represents 31% of total population (3,347,270), or 1 in 3 people Nutrition insecure children: 284,500 This represents 40% if the total child population in San Diego County (717,000) or more than 2 in 5 chil dren Nutrition insecure seniors : 146,000 This represents 30 % of total senior populations in San Diego County (487,000)2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 122 FEDERAL CAL-FRESH PROGRAM The Cal -Fresh Program, federally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the nation's largest nutrition assistance program and helps feed 40 million Americans each year. The federal government funds SNAP benefits and shares the cost with the states. SNAP recipients receive funds monthly, which are loaded onto an electronic benefit transfer card that they can use to purchase food from participating retailers. SNAP serves as a critical piece of the social safety net and has helped ensure that millions of Americans have food to eat during the pandemic. The largest source of food assistance in San Diego County continues to be the Cal -Fresh (SNAP) program. The total amount of food assistance from the Cal -Fresh program in 2020 increased by an estimated 8 million meals between January and November 2020. Increases in Cal - Fresh benefits and unemployment last year kept food insecurity from growing exponentially due to the pandemic and the economic shutdown, but the challenge persists for millions of people and could grow as some of the temporary benefits associated with the pandemic expire. FEDERAL REDUCED -PRICE MEALS PROGRAM (FRPM) According to a report released by the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative, www. San Diego County oi.org, the effect of poverty and food insecurity on students' overweight and obesity rates can most profoundly be observed when looking at districts with high concentrations of students enrolled in the Federal Reduced -Price Meals program (FRPM). All students can participate in school nutrition programs; however, students with family incomes under 130% of the Federal Poverty Level are eligible for free meals, and those with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level are eligible for low -cost (or \"reduced price\") meals. Students enrolled in this program not only come from lower income households but are also likely to be food insecure (California Department of Education, Student Poverty FRPM Data). Pre-COVID, half of all public -school students - over 250,000 children were enrolled in the Free & Reduced- Price Meal Program. When schools close, whether for a scheduled school closure like summer or an unscheduled school closure like a pandemic or wildfire, families often s truggle to ensure their children have the nutritious food they need to learn, grow, and thrive. For kids who depend on school meals for consistent nutrition, missed meals mean setbacks in physical health, emotional health, and academic fulfillmen t. COVID -19 forced schools into distanced learning, causing millions of children nationwide to lose access to free and reduced- price school meals. As a result, food insecurity increased most dramatically among families with school -age kids. In San Diego County alone, food insecurity rose from 1 in 5 children to 2 in 5 children 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 123 since the start of the pandemic. T he Pandemic -EBT (P- EBT) program, introduced in 2020, was quickly recognized by families and anti -hunger advocates as the most direct and effective way to close the child meal gap during times of school closures (San Diego Hunger Coalition). The programs highlighted below are ways that Scripps Health is addressing food insecurity, screenings, and eligibility benefits . SCRIPPS HEALTH CALFRESH SCREENINGS As health care delivery systems move towards a population health paradigm that incentivizes keeping patients healthy, hospitals and clinics are recognizing the significance of addressing social determinants of health, such as Food Insecurity (FI). Hospitals have been more proactive in intervening at some level of care to aid the individuals suffering from FI and their ability to gain control over their health. Accordingly, food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014known as CalFresh in California, significantly reduces the rate and severity of poverty throughout the state (California Budget & Policy Center, 2018). While SNAP and Women's, Infants, Children (WIC) have been successful in assisting low - income children and their families with additional funding for purchasing healthy foods, there is evidence that suggests screening for FI in healthcare settings is the best indicator for patients to access food- related assistance. As mentioned in section three of this report, the Public Resource S pecialist (PRS) Team screen all uninsured patients who have received services at any of the five Scripps hospital facilities. Scripps Health began screening for CalFresh in June 2017 through the support of the PRS team. The team has been successful in having an important conversation about food insecurity with patients and in Fiscal Year 2 021, the PRS team successfully screened 4,551 food insecure patients. Out of those screenings, PRS submitted 3,418 Medi -Cal applications to the County and 31% of the applications submitted were for both Medi -Cal and CalFresh. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 124 SCRIPPS MERCY WIC PROGRAM The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides nutritious food, education, and other support to low -income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women and their children up to age 5. The $6 billion program is federally funded and administered by USDA 's Food and Nutrition Services and local agencies. WIC helps address some SDOH by providing its participants with greater food security , educating the m about nutrition, assisting them with breastfeeding, and referring participants to social service agencies that may help them with housing and other needs. Scripps Mercy will continue to offer WIC services through its largest distribution location based in the City Heights community. The Scripps Mercy WIC Program, a federally funded nutrition program targeting pregnant and parenting women and their children (ages 0 to 5), is one of five WIC programs operating in San Diego County. WIC services provide nutr ition education, counseling services and food vouchers for a n average of 6,200 low-income women, infants and children monthly. In Fiscal Year 2021, the WIC program served 70,450 clients. Lactation education and support services are offered to improve breas tfeeding among postpartum and parenting women. The Scripps Mercy Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) has distribution sites at La Maestra Family Clinic/City Heights Wellness Center, as well as Linda Vista Health Center and other storefront facilities in Central and South San Diego County. In November 2021, Scripps WIC services moved to a suite at the Price Entities building. FOOD FINDERS - RESCUING FOOD, REDUCING HUNGER Scripps Corporate Food Service partnered with Food Finders, a multi -regional food bank and food rescue program that connects businesses to charitable institutions in need of donations. Food Finders connected Scripps with Interfaith Community Services in Escondido, which distributes food to people in need. All leftover food from Scripps Corporate facilities is packaged, picked up each day and transferred to the Scripps 4S Ranch Food and Nutrition Services freezer for storage. The cost is minimal, as Scripps uses the same amount of labor to package the food as it would to dispose of it, and unsold \"grab and go\" items are already packaged. Interfaith Community Services picks up the packaged frozen food twice per week and transports it to one of their facilities to help feed the community. This program is currently on hold due to the COVID -19 pandemic. COOKING FOR HEALTH Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine and Bastyr University's Master of Science in Nutrition for Wellness Program collaborate on offering free classes that teach 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 125 individuals how t o make vegetarian and vegan meals t hat are delicious a nd easy to prepare.

Scripps staff use a s ingle telephone number to contact staff at FACT, who then handle the selection of the appropriate vehicle, equipment, and personnel, and dispatch the ride. The program provides savings in processing time, cost of transportation and it offers the rider a more reliable and convenient transportation service. The initial pilot project was partly funded by a Community Enhancement grant awarded to FACT by the County of San Diego. Scripps realized a benefit using F ACT transport as a cost savings ; rather than using taxi vouchers, as well as trips that could take Scripps staff a great deal of time to find a vendor to do as other vendors may not be able to do trips to the b order or I mperial County as readily . FACT is a clearinghouse of sorts with multiple vendors and therefore saves the staff time in finding the appropriate transport at the right time. Scripps and FACT renewed their agreement in 2021 that will phase this service to all Scripps hospitals and enable staff to schedule rides via FACT's call center. Transportation is available 7 days a week for Scripps discharged patients to any location within San Diego and beyond. Most rides begin and end at the curbside, however door through door rides, wheelchair accessible rides and gurney rides are available on demand. FACT has provided 882 rides through August 2021 for Scripps patients throughout San Diego and as far away as Imperial County. In addition , FACT has delivered over 3,200 food boxes to San Diego households during April 2020- March 2021. This service was funded by SANDAG grants and provi ded in collaboration with the County of San Diego and 2-1- 1. FACT transported approximately 300 homeless individuals to and from shelters/hotels and other locations for quarantining and testing during March 2020- January 2021. This service was made possible through a partnership with the San Diego County Health & Human Services Agency (HSSA). Over 32,000 free trips on RideFACT also funded by SANDAG, were provided for essential needs as well as for essential workers during the pandemic (March 2020 -February 20 21). Over 4,000 new riders were added to FACT's client base. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 127 The following are the different transportation modalities that FACT -S D provides: Ambulatory - the rider can walk alone to and from the vehicle Curb -to-Curb - the rider will be picked up and dropped off at the curb of the facility/residence Door -to-Door - the rider requires the driver to walk them from the door of the facility/residence to the vehicle and from the vehicle to the door of the facility/residence Door -through- Door - the rider requires the driver to come inside the facility and transport them to the vehicle, the driver will drop them off at the door ofthe facility or residence Accessible vehicles and Mobility Devices - Walker, Cane, Folding Wheelchair, Wheelchair, Scooter, and vehicles equipped with Ramp or Lift Gurney Transportation SCRIPPS EMPLOYEE SPONSORED HOLIDAY DRIVES The holidays inspire many with the spirit of giving, and in a year like no other, generosity was in full force at Scripps throughout the holiday season. Each year Scripps staff put in time and energy into various donation drives to help those in our community who need assistance. Scripps teams donated clothing, household necessities and more, including: Boys and Girls Club - adopted three families who had been directly affected with job loss and/or illness StandUp for Kids - hygiene and snack packs Polins ky Children's Center Promise2Kids Campaign (organization promotes foster care in children) - 38 toy items and 14 monetary gifts South Bay Community Services - toys an d gift cards In addition, Scripps employees \"adopted\" several families in San Diego who were experiencing a tough year. Scripps Mercy Hospital held its annual Holiday Toy Drive in early December to benefit the pediatric patients of La Maestra Community Health Center in City Heights. La Maestra's mission goes beyond providing quality health care to the communities it serves. The La Maestra Circle of Care begins with the health of the individual at its core and extends out into the \"well -being of the individual,\" which captures all non- medical needs. Daily, individuals come to La Maestra for one type of service and end up identifying several other services available to meet their greater, and unrecognized needs. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 128 This year, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego staff and physicia ns donated numerous gifts for children of all ages. Along with the toys, donations of gift cards and cash were contributed to families in need. Over the years, S cripps Mercy H ospital and La Maestra have jointly approached many challenges that face underserved families in the urban San Diego region. As these families have experienced the hardships associated with the health and economic consequences of this historic pandemic, giving to the La Maestra families took on a sense of importance. FOSTERING VOLUNT EERISM Scripps believes that health improvement begins when people take an active role in making a positive impact on their community. For this reason, Scripps supports volunteer programs for Scripps employees and affiliated physicians who want to make an even larger impact on their community. Scripps matches the talents and interests of employees and physicians with community needs, such as mentoring partnerships with local schools and providing free medical and surgical care for patients in need. In addition to the financial community benefit contributions made during F iscal Year 2021 , Scripps employees and affiliated physicians donated a sizable portion of their personal time volunteering to support Scripps sponsored community benefit programs. With close to 11,231 hours, the estimated dollar value of this volunteer labor is $617,573*, which is not included in the Scripps F iscal Year 2021 community benefit programs and services totals.

HEALTH RESEARCH TRAUMA RESEARCH GRADUATE STUDENT INTERNSHIP The Trauma Research Graduate Student Internship is designed for a ctive students with an interest in public health, epidemiology, trauma and injury prevention, biomedical statistics, and health policy. This internship, in an earlier form, began in 2005 as a post - baccalaureate research internship in collaboration with the Johns -Hopkins Post - Baccalaureate Premedical Program. In 2016, the trauma research program began accepting Master of Public Health Students from San Diego State University's Graduate School of Public Health to provide practical experience in a research set ting. In 2018, this program was expanded to include students in the University of California, San Diego master's in clinical research program . Students learn to construct study samples, clean data, analyze data, and write manuscripts for submission to medi cal journals. The rotation is conducted at Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego. All researchers have subsequently received authorship for publication in leading academic journals. CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING STUDY The National Institutes of Health awarded Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute (SWDI) $3.1 million grant to study the use of wireless continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices among hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes in hope of better controlling their blood sugar during their admission. The new study will build on earlier research conducted by Scripps Whittier and on the subsequent use of CGM devices among patients with diabetes in Scripps Health hospitals during the COVID -19 pandemic. Early in the public health crisis, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the way for hospitals to use the devices to reduce the number of times a nurse must go into a patient's room for more conventional finger pricks. Without CGM, nurses typically enter a patient's room four to six times a day to check blood glucose levels. The 5- year study will compare the use of real -time, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) versus standard point -of-care (POC) testing protocols at Scripps Mercy Chula Vista hospital. This large, N=554 randomized controlled trial will build on the lessons learned from SWDI's earlier Hospital CGM pilot study that was published in Diabetes 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 146 Care in 2020, a nd the more recent \" CGM as Standar d of C are\" i nitiative that has reache d more than 500 patients at M ercy San Diego dur ing the COVID -19 pandemic.

IDF Diabetes Atlas . 2021: http://www.diabetesatlas .org 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 147 The NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded $2.9 million, the largest NIH award to Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute to date, to study an innovative approach to helping Hispanics with diabetes better manage their disease. Scripps Whittier has shown that health- related text messages sent every day for six months to low -income Hispanics with type 2 diabetes helped produce blood sugar level improvements that equaled those resulting from some glucose- lowering medications. The Dulce Digital clinical trial was the first randomized controlled study to look at the use of text messages to help underserved Hispanics better self -manage their diabetes through glycemic control. Digital- Me provided patients with tools to help them manage their diabetes day to day and improve their health, including text messaging, wireless blood glucose and medication monitoring, diet and exercise assessments, and personalized feedback and goal setting. This study was conducted in collaboration with Neighborhood Healthcare, San Diego State University, and the University of California San Diego. The participants received health- related text messages every day for six months and they saw improvements in their blood sugar levels that equaled those resulting from some glucose- lowering medications. The Digital -Me clinical trial r epresents the first randomized controlled study to look at the use of text messages to help underserved Hispanics better self -manage their diabetes through glycemic control. The study finalized its enrollment of participants as of 2020 due to COVID -19. The study is now in the process of finalizing the results for publication to come out in 2022. SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES DISTRESS STUDY The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded a five-year, $3.3 million grant in 2020 to Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute to study the integration of mental health services in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes to better address the emotional distress than often accompanies the chronic disease. Researchers at Scripps Whittier will use the federal funding to launch a large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial that will evaluate whether the integration of diabetes distress care with routine medical care results in better management of diabetes and better health- related quality of life. The study is a collaborative effort that capitalizes on the complimentary expertise of a clinical psychologist/endocrinologist partnership. The program will begin enrollment of participant s in November 2021.

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Quality health care is highly dependent upon health education systems and medical research programs. Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays a vital role in improving the community's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 166 Each year, S cripps E ncinitas al locates r esources t o advance health care services through professional e ducation health programs a nd research.

Scripps Mercy Hospital 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 171 SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL Located in the central service area and near the United States Mexico border Scripps Mercy Hospital provides health care services for 23.6 percent of the inpatient population living within the hospital's service areas. Today, the hospital has 655 licensed beds and more than 4,297employees. Scripps Mercy Hospital is San Diego's longest established and only Catholic hospital. The two hospital campuses (San Diego Campus and Chula Vista Campus) share a license and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). Scripps Mercy is designated as a disproportionate share hospital, providing care to many patients who either lack health insurance or are covered through a government subsid y program. Within the Scripps Mercy service area, Scripps Mercy cares for 27.9 percent of Medicare patients, 25.5 percent of Medi -Cal patients, 11.7 percent of commercially insured patients, and 22.6 percent of patients have another payment source, includi ng self -pay, CMS or charity care. SAN DIEGO CAMPUS Founded in 1890, Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego has a long tradition of caring for the underserved. Located in Central San Diego County, Scripps Mercy San Diego has 482 licensed beds and 3,077 employees . As a major teaching hospital, Scripps Mercy San Diego, provides a primary site for the clinical education of more than 140 residents per year. Scripps Mercy San Diego provides a wide range of acute medical care services including, but not limited to, int ensive care, cancer care, cardiac treatment, endoscopy, neurology, nuclear medicine, orthopedics, radiology, rehabilitation, respiratory care and urology services, plus a variety of support services for low -income patients.

Nevertheless, the service is provided because it meets an identified community need, which if no longer offered would either be unavailable in the area or fall to government or another not -for-profit organization. Subsidized services do not include ancillary services that support lines, such as lab and radiology (if these services are provided to low -income persons, they are reported as charity care/financial assis tance). The total expense for subsidized health services for Scripps Mercy Fiscal Year 2021 was $2,183,502 which includes Scripps Inpatient Behavioral Health. Scripps offers inpatient adult behavioral health services at the Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego campus. The Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program also actively supports community programs to reduce the stigma of mental illness and help affected individuals live and work in the community. 340 B DRUG PRICING PROGRAM AND IN-LIEU OF FUNDS Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Designated as a disproportionate share hospital (DSH), Scripps Mercy is eligible to purchase out patient drugs at a reduced price, allowing it to stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients, and providing more comprehensive services. Scripps Mercy provides care to a large number of patients who either lack heal th insurance or are covered through a government subsidy program. One way Scripps Mercy provides care to some of our most needy patients is through in-lieu of funds. In- lieu of funds are used for unfunded or underfunded patients and their post-discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long- term acute care and home health. In addition, funds are also used for medications, equipment and transportation services. The total subsidized expense for in- lieu of funds for Mercy H ospital San Diego and Chula Vista during Fiscal Year 2021 was $1, 981,058 SCRIPPS RECUPERATIVE CARE PROGRAMS (RCU) Scripps Health has an agreement with the San Diego City Refuge of Recuperative Care Shelter (RCS) which provides a safe discharge for chronically homeless patients with ongoing medical needs. All patients are unfunded or underfunded. Most have substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Lack of funding, mental illness, as well as alcohol and/or substance abuse, makes post -acute placement of these homeless patients 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 174 difficult. During the pandemic, all San Diego Homeless shelters experienced COVID -19 outbreak s, making RCS a true place of refuge for 44 of our chronically homeless patients. The Case Management and Social Work departments assist with a needed supply of medication, appointments, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), setting up Home Health Services if needed, and connects patients to psych as part of the hospital discharge plan to City of Refuge. City of Refuge further supports clients in meeting these goals using community resources to meet individual social service needs. Scripps pays the City of Refu ge a daily rate for housing and services they provide to the patients. The City of Refuge provides a safe, secure environment, with 24- hour supervision, medication oversight, meals, clothing, case management, assistance with Medi -Cal, with transition to Ma naged Medi -Cal and disability applications, referrals to rehab and other programs, and help finding permanent or transitional housing using county resources. DME and other needed services are provided by Scripps when funding is not available. All patients are connected to a medical home, and primary care in the community. Patients with psych disorders are established with a psychiatrist in the community if they are willing. Patient transportation needs are coordinated by City of Refuge, but may include insurance funded transport services, and occasionally Scripps Shuttle, or use of taxi voucher. The City of Refuge began taking patients routinely in October of 2019. This year 44 patients so far have met the need for RCS admission, but many did not qualify due to behavior, unstable mental illness, or unwillingness to abstain from substance abuse. As a group, the RCS patients had a cumulative of 480 hospital days of stay, an average of 10.9 hospital days of stay, before going to RCS October 2020 to date. The RC S has taken medically complex patients, including those with: IV antibiotics, wound vacs, skin grafts, fractures, abscesses, osteomyelitis, amputation, dog bites, DKA, GI bleeds, pancreatitis, ESRD on dialysis, end stage liver disease, diabetes, mild encephalopathy, ostomies, MVA, pedestrian cancer), HIV/Aids, sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, CHF. Patients were assault victims with gunshot and stab wounds, facial trauma, and surgical post op patients and many are diabetic. Psych problems are common and occasionally the main issue for RCS clients. Over 80% of this group were either positive for alcohol, drugs or drug screen or had a drug history addressed by the physician in the H & P. More specifically, 30% of RCS clients had used opiates, heroin, or meth. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 175 The following are outcome metrics tracked by Scripps for the City of Refuge program. For FY21 total cost savings for Scripps were $735,150. Of Recuperative Care Shelter patients, 22% had standard Medi -Cal insurance, 11% HPE Medi -Cal HMO's. Approximately 20% of patients sought to secure income from government programs, social security, and CA short term disability; six total clients ap plied or received income benefits. Four have applied and received Medi -Cal HMO's while at the RCS with the assistance of their case management department. The program assisted Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center patients. RCS assisted two patients in maintaining their health and transitioned them into independent living homes for additional care. This year we had several successes, with the RCS Manager assisting with 3 family reunifications out of state. Three patients transitioned to drug rehab centers, and several into PATH, Interfaith, and Mental Health treatment programs. The Complex Care Manager ensured 90 percent of RCS patients were scheduled and connected to a primary care provider or had established care at one of the community clinics. One of the patients admitted to RCS was established with ongoing oncology care and treatment with assistance from Medi -Cal and Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center. Following their stay at City of Refuge: 18% of the RCS patients completed their recuperative care and returned to previous living and 5% went back to the hospital as they needed further treatment. SCRIPPS RESIDENT CLINIC AT FHCSD HILLCREST FAMILY HEALTH CENTER In January 2019, the Scripps Mercy Hospital transitioned the Internal Medicine ambulatory teaching program from Scripps Mercy Hospital Mercy Clinic to Hillcrest Family Health Center. This is a facility within the network of Family Health Centers of San Die go (FHCSD); the Scripps Resident Clinic was incorporated into the operation of the FHCSD Hillcrest Family Health Center. This move expands the existing affiliation between Scripps Mercy Hospital and Family Health Centers of San Diego to include the GME out patient clinical rotation for Internal Medicine. The GME affiliation with FHCSD is a significant opportunity for our patients to have access to much more comprehensive interdisciplinary care. It is also an opportunity for our Residents to learn more about functioning in an interdisciplinary setting and 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 176 collaborating with other healthcare providers. The affiliation with FHCSD has improved the patient's transition of care from the Hospital's inpatient setting to outpatient / follow - up care with the support of FHCSD Care Coordination processes. The new Scripps MD Anderson Prebys Cancer Center on the Mercy Hospital Campus will expand learning opportunities for our Residents, and future careers in Hematology/Oncology. The agreement to co- locate the GME program w ith Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) is an expansion of an ongoing, successful relationship with this federally qualified health center. Scripps and FHCSD already work together in a number of areas that benefit the medically underserved, including a pediatric residency training program, a collaborative prenatal care and delivery program, a coordinated behavioral health program, and emergency room referrals for patients without medical homes. This program has given its patients access to increased services, including case management, onsite psychiatric services, dental care, onsite phlebotomy, adjacent HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis C treatment, physical therapy, acupuncture, sports medicine, and other services. From a GME perspective, this is an opportunity for our residents to practice within a broader interdisciplinary setting and regularly collaborate with other community health care providers. Subspecialty teaching is provided to the Family Medicine Residents by Scripps Mercy subspecialty faculty. In additi on, since 2013, Scripps Mercy Medical Education has supported the Teaching Health Centers Family Medicine Residency at Family Health Centers, with all inpatient teaching except for Pediatrics occurring at Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative . Scripps Mercy Hospital's Behavioral Health Inpatient Program helps patients and their loved one's work through short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Behavioral Health Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In Fiscal Year 2021, the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $6.3 million loss in total operations, with 4.1 million of this loss being captured in Medi -Cal/CMS and Charity Care. In Fiscal Year 2021, 1.9 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 177 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COLLABORATION Scripps is partnering with Acadia- Healthcare Company, Inc. to develop a new inpatient behavioral health facility in Chula Vista. The facility will provide treatment for three times as many patients as existing behavioral health unit at Scripps Mercy San Diego. Acadia provides behavioral health services through a network of 586 health care facilities w ith approximately 18,000 beds in 40 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. This new center which is planned to open in 2024 will serve as a regional resource to meet the needs of patients across San Diego County and will be operated through a joint ve nture between Scripps and Acadia. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT SERVICES Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the behavioral health outpatient day program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego to expand outpati ent behavioral health offerings to the Medi -Cal population. Collaboration with hospital partners such as NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness), the Family Health Centers of San Diego, the McAlister Institute and Hazelden Betty Ford highlight Scripps commitment to the community we serve. Scripps has also received grant money as part of the Behavioral Health Pilot Project to embed substance use counselors in the emergency department to facilitate linkage to medication assisted outpatient programs. 178 SCR IPPS MERCY HOSPITAL SAN DIEGO CAMPUS 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORT; FISCAL YEAR 2021 The Scripps Mercy Hospital Community Benefit Report is an account of the hospital's dedication and commitment to improving the health of the community, detailing the programs that have provided benefit over and above standard health care practices in Fiscal Year 2021 (October 2020 to September 2021).

Serves as the community engagement arm for the Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded by the National Institute of Health. In collaboration with the Scripps Resea rch Translational Institute, the scientific and community worlds are merged to develop community driven research agendas in diabetes, wireless medicine and genomics. Established the Scripps San Diego Diabetes Genebank, a biobank designed to analyze the genetic predisposition of developing Type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic abnormalities in a Mexican American cohort. There have been tremendous advances in genomics medicine with minimal focus on minoritygroups, such as Latinos, who develop Type 2 diabetes at much higher rates thanother groups. With a commitment to growth and innovation, Scripps Whittier is building onProject Dulce's proven success, Dulce Digital reached 125 participants to test theeffectiveness of using health technology via text messages tailored to support patients with managing Type 2 diabetes with prompts ranging from healthy eating habits, physical activity reminders and behavior change management. Scripps Whittier is operating two NIH community -based research trials focused on closing the health disparities gap. The first, Mi Puente/The Bridge, uses a nurse/volunteer team to help patients with behavioral health and chronic diseaseget the services they need after hospital discharge to prevent readmissions andimprove health and quality of life. The second builds on Project Dulce's successful texting program, Dulce- Digital Me, by testing the effectiveness of real time digital feedback to people with diabetes.2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 212 Train health professionals locally and across the nation to provide the highest quality and most up- to-date diabetes care. Courses are designed for health care providers seeking to understand the new and complex clinical treatment options for Type 1, Type 2, gestational diabetes and prevention. Scripps Whittier'sprofessional education program is led by a team of experts that include endocrinologists, nurses, dieticians, psychologists and community health workers. Leads the diabetes care line at Scripps and deploys diabetes educators and advance practice nurses in Scripps inpatient and ambulatory environments to support quality diabetes care and patient education. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded a five-year, $3.3 million grant in 2020 to Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute to study the integration of mental health services in the care of patients with Type 1 diabetes to better address the emotional distress than often accompanies thechronic disease. Researchers at Scripps Whittier will use the federal funding to launch a large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial that will evaluate whether the integration of diabetes distress care with routine medical care resultsin better management of diabetes and better health- related quality of life. The innovative, RN/CDCES + Psychologist model called ACT1VATE will specificallybe designed to provide wrap- around support for patients struggling with glycemic control (HbA1c>8%) and emotional distress related to their Diabetes Distress\".The study is a collaborative effort that capitalizes on the complimentary expertise of a clinical psychologist/endocrinologist partnership. A second award was received from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for a 5- year $3 million study to begin in 2021 conducted by Scri pps Whittier Diabetes Institute. The study will be based at Scripps Mercy Hospital which provides services to many of our under -resourced communities. Given the known serious consequences of uncontrolled bloodsugars during hospitalization, this research proposes to seamlessly integrate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the hospital to test a dynamic and digitized, team -based approach to glucose management in an understudied, yet high- risk population. A Digital Dashboard will be used, as it facilitates real-time, remote monitoring of a large volume of patients simultaneously; automatically identifies and prioritizes patients for intervention; and will detect any and all potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes in a hospital environment. Thestudy will focus on clinical metrics (glucose control, infection) that are in- line with patient priorities and US hospital quality initiatives will increase relevance to2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 213 healthcare systems and enhance incentive to adopt this innovative digital monitoring approach. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 214 SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORT; FISCAL YEAR 2021 The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute 2022 Community Benefit Report is an account of Scripps Whittier's dedication and commitment to improving the community's health, detailing programs that have provided benefit over and above standard health care practices in Fiscal Year 2021 (October 2020 to September 2021). MAKING A FINANCIAL COMMITMENT During Fiscal Year 2021, Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute devoted $566,861 to community benefit programs, including uncompensated health care, community health services, professional education and health research. The programs offered by Scripps Whittier emphasize community -based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greater risk for health problems. The diabetes epidemic permeates every facet of our community. The percentage of individuals entering hospitals with diabetes is rising, the number of children developing diabetes is growing, and larger numbers of people are experiencing complications from diabetes, such as renal failure and heart disease, at an earlier age. Developing unique and innovative clinical programs and community -based research is urgently needed to combat this epidemi c. The diabetes and obesity epidemic have a disproportionate impact on low -income ethnic groups, yet there is little research demonstrating clinically and cost -effective care and treatment models for these populations. Diabetes leads to school and work absenteeism, elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. Diabetes is an important health issue because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and an analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2019 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cause of death. In San Diego County diabetes has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 -30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. This is especially true in the South Bay communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 215 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and thousands more who are undiagnosed, have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing diabetes.

Scripps System wide Programs 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 228 SCRIPPS SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS ABOUT SCRIPPS SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS Scripps supports number of programs that meet the health care needs of patients and community members throughout San Diego County. These include programs operated by Seaport Scripps Home Health, Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Scripps Clinical Research Center and Scripps Syst em wide Community Benefit Services. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER In 2016, Scripps Health and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced a partnership agreement to create a comprehensive and clinically integrated cancer center in San D iego, to be known as Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center. This new center combined Scripps leading knowledge with MD Anderson's world- renowned expertise, best practices and guidelines to serve patients in San Diego and Southern California. Scripps MD Anderson is committed to fighting cancer through a collaborative, team approach that puts the patient at the center of care. Scripps and MD Anderson are both nationally recognized leaders in cancer therapy and are combining their strength to bring some of the mos t advanced cancer care available to San Diego. Scripps MD Anderson's physicians and staff work collaboratively toward cancer prevention, early detection, coordinated treatment and community support services, and are actively involved in leading- edge clinic al, translational and basic research. Additional resources include specialized breast care centers, infusion clinics, nurse navigators, nutrition program, genetic counselors, Shiley Fitness Center, rehabilitation services, support groups and Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER REGISTRY Scripps formed the system -wide cancer registry in the early 2000s, before which, each Scripps hospital had its own. Since 1975, the Scripps Cancer Registry has been collecting cancer data on Scripps patients for research, epidemiological studies, education and patient treatment. Analysis of this data gives Scripps physicians the ability to measure the quality and effectiveness of the care cancer patients receive within the Scripps system. The data also aids in determining which Cancer Center programs should be developed or further expanded and helps drive cancer statistics at the national level. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER - $22 MILLION FOR HEALTH PROGRAMS Scripps was awarded funding for a variety of initiatives to support patient care, research and health equity in the areas of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease and 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 229 neurocognitive conditions. Scripps Health's cancer program plans to use funds to support several breast cancer efforts, including clinical trials, translational research, expanded biorepository research, community outreach and a cancer survivorship program. Scripps also plans a variety of projects designed to address health care disparities, including outreach, screening and supportive services for dementia, breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. SCRIPPS CLINICAL RESEARCH SERVICES (CRS) Research and clinical discovery have been part of Scripps Health's mission since its founding in 1924. In partnership wit h the Scripps Clinical Medical Group (SCMG) via the Research Innovation Committee (RIC), Clinical Research Services consolidates and expands access to clinical research trials for SCMG physicians and patients across the Scripps system. The mission of the RIC is to provide comprehensive oversight and allocation of resources for research , so that patients have access to new and emerging treatment opportunities when appropriate. In addition, there are several specialties with nationally accredited continuing and graduate medical education programs supported through the RIC and CRS. The Research Innovation Committee was created in 2018 . Currently there are more than 25+ Scripps Clinic medical specialties under one operations team. As a result, RIC is able to accelerate the access to new technologies for patients by consolidating the various components of clinical investigation into a seamless, streamlined regulatory, operational, and administrative process. Scripps continues building in its strong foundation for clinical and translational research through small pilot studies to large multicenter trials placed at various locations across the system, engaging both inpatient and outpatient settings. As ambulatory -based research increases across the system, RIC, Scripps Clinic and CRS support more than 92 principal investigators and about 450 active clinical research protocols crossing interdisciplinary disease categories.

SRTI is dedicated to accelerating the \"translation\" of basic laboratory discoveries into clinical trials and ultimately approved treatments. Under the direction of Scripps Research, SRTI is supported in part by the National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA). A five- year, $20 million grant to support translational clinical research, infrastructure and training first awarded in 2008 was renewed in 2013 and renewed again in 2018 for its 3 rd five-year NIH grant through 2023 for $31.5 million. The Community Engagement Program for this award is led by Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute which has provided the San Diego community with the most advanced diabetes care, education, research and support for more than 30 years at Scripps Health. In the last two years with grant support, the community engagement core has evolved and grown into the Scripps Hub Academic Research Core (SHARC), to broaden its research support beyond diabetes and cardiometabolic disease to include nearly all disease states (e.g., cancer, orthopedics, transplant, allergy/immunology, dermatology and many more) across the Scripps health system. The team now includes a research navigator, biostatistician, and community engagement program manager that provide consultations and guidance in expanding the research platform within Scripps and the San Diego community. The SHARC team enhances the involvement of community and clinicians in all areas o f translational and transformational research. Scripps supports community -engaged research that aim to bring researchers and community partners together to share their knowledge, skills and resources with a common goal of improving community health. Over t he last two decades, health research and practice 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 231 has increasingly employed community -engaged research methods, defined as \"the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity, special interests, or s imilar situations to address issues affecting the well -being of those people.\" SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIP The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute (SWDI), in partnership with the San Diego State University So uth Bay Latino Research Center have several recent examples of innovative community -engaged research projects. These include three, five- year awards from the National institutes of Health worth nearly $9M to develop culturally tailored interventions to improve outcomes for diverse, predominantly underserved individuals living with chronic cardiometabolic conditions. The first award trains medical assistants to provide health coaching to patients with Type 2 diabetes as part of routine primary care in two di verse health systems i.e., Scripps Health and Neighborhood Healthcare, a federally qualified health system that provides care to a low income, predominantly Hispanic, patient population. The second study uses mobile health (mHealth) technology to deliver a personalized, diabetes self -management education and support program to Hispanic patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. The final award evaluates Mi Puente, or \"My Bridge,\" which is a Behavioral Health Nurse + Community Mentor approach to preven t hospital readmissions and improve quality of life among Hispanics with multiple chronic conditions and behavioral health concern(s) admitted to a safety -net hospital near the US -Mexico border. SCRIPPS COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES Scripps System wide Community Benefit Services provides oversight, support, guidance and coordination of Scripps community health and outreach programs, helping ensure that they are in accordance with the Scripps mission, values and strategic objectives. This program also supports the Strategic Planning Committee, a committee of the Scripps Board of Trustees, in assessing and planning to meet community need. Additionally, this program is responsible for developing the triennial health needs assessment and, through the Community Benefit Fund, supports community programs that address San Diego County's high- priority health needs. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 232 SCRIPPS SYSTEM WIDE 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORT; FISCAL YEAR 2021 This section is an account of Scripps dedication and commitment to improving the health of the community, detailing the Scripps System wide programs that have provided benefit over and above standard health care practices in Fiscal Year 2021 (October 2020 to September 2021).

CATHOLIC CHARITIES The partnership continued but no funding was provided in FY21 to Catholic Charities. The partnership offers short -term emergency shelter for medically fragile, homeless patients being discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista campuses. Case management and shelter are provided for previously homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital who no longer require hospital care but still need a short -term, supportive environment. Patients demonstrating a readiness for change are assisted with one week in a hotel along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent income sources, housing, and ongoing support for self -reliance. The goal of this partnership is to reduce the incidence of ER recidivism and improve quality of life for the patients. CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHEA) Funding provides low income, uninsured Mercy Clinic and behavioral health patients help obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while reducing uncompensated care expenses at Mercy. This Medical Legal Partnership, places Consumer Center staff onsite at Scripps Mercy Hospital within the Behavioral Health Unit and provides accessible legal assistance, in addition to receiving direct referrals from other Scripps facilities . The project provides advocacy services for time intensive government benefit cases and the Consumer Center stresses the importance of accessing community- based services for routine health care instead of using the ED's and hospital departments as well as the importance of establishing medical homes. ERIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION Funding provides sudden cardiac arrest screenings in school -age children and adolescents. As a sponsor for the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation, Scripps has supported more than 34,000 free cardiac screenings to local teens, including the homeless, uninsured, and underinsured through more than $120,000 in annual contribution since 2012. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 236I n Fiscal Year 2021, Scripps made a $8,500 contribution to help pay for screenings. The support has funded free youth heart screenings, which have identified a total of 534 with cardiac abnormalities - 239 serious enough to cause sudden cardiac arrest. CANCER/ONCOLOGY In 2019 cancer was the leading cause of death in San Diego County, respons ible for 22.9% percent of deaths. There were 5,018 deaths due to cancer (all s ites) and an age-a djusted death rate of 135.2 deaths per 100,000 population in San Diego County.65 In response to this serious health concern, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs to educate people on the importance of early detection and treatment for s ome of the most common forms of cancer.

Across the Scripps Health system, doctors, nurses, caregivers and support staff continued to work together in Fiscal Year 2021 to fight the COVID -19 pandemic. Scripps continued with the implementation of Command Centers, COVID -19 Nurse Line, Testing and Surge Tents as Testing Cabanas and Community Support. In addition, awareness and education for the community in vaccine safety and availability including production, educational material, coordination of media response and telephone hotlines for answering questions was crucial. SCRIPPS DEL MAR SUPER VACCINE CENTER Scripps' unwavering commitment to the community was evident is its management of the Scripps Del Mar Vaccination Super Station at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. Scripps worked in partnership with the County of San Diego to meet an important community health need and ramped up its vaccination efforts at one of the most expansive locations around: the Del Mar Fairgrounds. The Super Station was opened on February 12, 2021, as part of the effort to get as many community members a COVID -19 vaccine as quickly as possible. The Scripps Del Mar Super Vaccine Center delivered more than 117,000 vaccine doses before it ended its operation in June 2021. The closing of the Del Mar site was announced in early June, a decision that was made following a drastic reduction in the amount of people seeking vaccination. It took a monumental effort by many Scripps staff to initially get the Del Mar site up and running. Those staff included members of pharmacy, IS, security, facilities, human resources and many others. These departments made the site functional and created a system that worked, they also did it on a very t ight timeline. Volunteers also played a key role in the site's ability to deliver vaccines - both those from Scripps and the community at large. Whether it be checking people in, helping direct traffic flow or administering vaccinations, the ability to hav e a volunteer pool to draw from was critical, particularly as there could be dramatic variation from day to day. 2022 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 240VACCINATION SUPERSTATION BY THE NUMBERS Number of vaccine doses delivered - 117,323 Highest number of vaccine doses administered in one day - 6,007 Number of community volunteers who put in a shift - 1,750 Number of Scripps staff who worked at site - 100+ Total days site operated - 84 Expenses associated with the Del Mar Vaccine Center - $215,851.46 SCRIPPS POST-COVID CONTINUING CARE Scripps Health developed the Post -COVID Continuing Care Program to address the lingering complications endured by many patients previously infected with the COVID - 19 virus.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION Having the ability to provide emergency services for those injured in a local disaster, while continuing to care for hospitalized patients, is a critical community need. Our employees' connection to our Mission is apparent every day \u2014including during times of crisis. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Scripps developed a system wide disaster preparedness program. As part of this effort, Scripps created the volunteer Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT). SCRIPPS MEDICAL RESPONSE TEAM (SMRT) Scripps maintains active readiness for the Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT). The SMRT is available to deploy when the State of California Emergency Medical System Authority (EMSA) activates the California Medical Assistance Team (Cal -Mat), and requests team augmentation to respond to an active event like a wildfire or earthquake where medical assistance is needed in the affected area(s). SMRT includes clinical staff and others from across the organization ready to mobilize during times of crisis to provide care where it's needed. Currently, the team has 76 active members, plus hundreds of other employees who have joined a reserve list to volunteer their services. The team has responded to numerous local, national and international emergencies. This genuine response in times of need sends a powerful message about the organization's dedication to be helping our community \u2014 and beyond. Due to C OVID -19, there were no opportunities to deploy in 2021. SAN DIEGO COUNTY NATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND OUTREACH EDUCATION Scripps Health maximizes awareness and encourages participation in disaster preparedness activities to affect change at the community level.

Community Benefit O perations - activities associated with conducting community health needs assessments, community benefit program administration, and the organization's activities associated with fundraising or grant -writing for community benefit programs. Activities or programs cannot be reported if they are provided primarily for marketing purposes or if they are more beneficial to the organization than to the community. Community Building A ctivities - can include, but are not limited to, the following: a.Physical improvements and housing, which can include the provision or rehabilitation of housing for vulnerable populations. b.Economic development, which can include assisting small business development in neighborhoods with vulnerable populations and creating new employment opportunities in areas with high rates of joblessness. c.Community support, which can include childcare and mentoring programs for vulnerable populations or neighborhoods, neighborhood support groups, violenceprevention programs, and disaster readiness and public healt h emergency activities. d.Environmental improvements, which can include activities to address environmental hazards that affect community health, such as alleviation of water2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 252 or air pollution, safe removal or treatment of garbage or other waste products, and other activities to protect the community from environmental hazards. e.Leadership development and training for community members, which can includetraining in conflict resolution; civic, cultural, or language skills; and medicalinterpreter skills for community residents. f.Coalition building which can include participation in community coalitions and other collaborative efforts with the community to address health and safety issues. g.Community health improvement advocacy, which can include efforts to supportpolicies and programs to safeguard or improve public health, access to health care services, housing, the environment, and transportation. h.Workforce development, which can include recruitment of physicians and other health professionals to medical shortage areas or other areas designated asunderserved, and collaboration with educational institutions to train and recruit health professionals needed in the community. i.Other community building activities that protect or improve the community's health or safety that are not described in the categories listed in lines a through habove. Community Health Improvement S ervices - activities or programs, subsidized by the hospital, carried out or supported for the express purpose of improving community health. Community Health Needs Assessment R eport (CHNA) - the written report adopted for the hospital facility by an authorized body of the hospital facility. Community H ealth Needs - those requisites for improvement or maintenance of health status in the community. Cost A ccounting - Cost accounting systems provide the most accurate portrayal of the true cost of community benefit activities. Measurement of the costs associated with specific activities and programs to provide information meaningful to management. For example, cost accounting is used to determine the amount of an organization's total expense that reasonably can be attributed to community benefit, to assign indirect (overh ead) expense to the direct cost of a program, and to estimate the cost associated with serving a subset of patients, such as Medicaid recipients. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 253 Direct C osts - \"Direct costs\" means salaries and benefits, supplies, and other expenses directly related to the actual conduct of each activity or program. Direct Offsetting Revenue - Revenue from the activity during the year that offsets the total community benefit expense of that activity. Includes any revenue generated by the activity or program, such as reimbursement for services provided to program patients . Direct offsetting reve nue also includes restricted grants or contributions that the organization uses to provide a community benefit, such as a restricted grant to provide financial assistance or fund research. Direct offsetting revenue does not include unrestricted grants or contributions that the organization uses to provide a community need. Health R esearch - can include, but is not limited to, clinical research, community health research, and generalizable studies on health care delivery. Hospital Provider F ees - States have some form of Medicaid provider tax (or fees and assessments) in place. Through these arrangements, providers pay funds to states that then are appropriated to Medicaid agencies and serve as a source of matching funds that yields federal Medicaid revenue. These fees are included in community benefit accounting as Medicaid cost, and any revenues they yield are also included in Medicaid \"direct offsetting revenue .\" Implementation S trategy - the written document that describes the hospital facility's strateg y to meet the community health needs identified through the hospital facility's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) . In-Kind C ontributions - Donations made (or received) using resources that are not legal tender (e.g., cash, checks, credit cards). Donations of supplies (e.g., pharmaceuticals), equipment, or staff time that benefits another organization are examples of in- kind contributions . In community benefit accounting, in- kind contributions are valued fairly. For example, the hospital donates a two- year old computer to a community clinic. The community benefit expense would be $1,000 if the computer were purchased for $3,000 and after two years of use it has depreciated to a value on the books of the hospital of $1,000. In-Lieu of Funds - Funds used for unfunded or under -funded patients and their post - discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long- term acute care, and home health. In addition, funds are also used for medications, equipment, and transportation services. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 254 Net Community Benefit E xpense - Total community benefit expense minus direct offsetting revenue.

Examples include: the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), or the California Children's Services (CCS) Program. Payer - Insurance companies, health care service plans, Medicare, Medi -Cal and other private or public entities that pay hospitals for health care provided to thei r sponsored patients. Professional Education and Health R esearch - includes clinical research as well as professional education of non-Scripps employees including graduate medical education (GME), nursing resource development, and other health care professional training. Costs for medical residents and interns may be included as health professions educations costs. Calculations based on total program expense. Restricted Contributions (Grants) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property made by a donor or grantor that has stipulated a temporary or permanent use for the resources provided. Donors or grantors provide restricted contributions with the intent of supporting a particular activity or program. Restrictions are stated in writing by the donor or grantor when they make a gift or grant. Subsidized Health S ervices - Patient care services the organization provides despite a financial loss, (even) after removing the effects of charity care and Medi -Cal shortfalls (and bad debt). Clinical programs are provided at a loss because they are needed by the community. The service meets an identified community need if it is reasonable to conclude that if the organization no longer offered the service, the service would be unavailable in the community, the community's capacity to provide the service would be below the community's need, or the service would become the responsibility of government or another tax -exempt organization. Examples of such services are inpatient psychiatric units; satellite clinics serving low- income communities and burn units. Total Community Benefit E xpense - Total gross expense of the activity incurred during the year. Uncompensated Health C are - Includes charity, under -reimbursed care and bad debt. Shortfalls are derived using the payer -based cost allocation methodology. Bad 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 255 debt and charity care are estimated by extracting the gross write offs of bad debt and charity care charges and applying the hospital RCC (Ratio of Cost to Charge) to estimate net uncompensated cost. Under -Reimbursed C are - Care that is reimbursed below cost by County Medical Services, Medi -Cal and Medi -Cal HMO, Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO and SHPS Medicare. Unrestricted Contributions (Grants) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property that are free from any external restrictions and are available for general use.

Includes Black/African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, AsianIndian, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Vietnamese, Native Hawaiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, or other nonwhite racial groups, as well as individuals of Hispanic/Latino origin, including Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Chicanos, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans. It also includes Socially disadvantaged groups: The unhoused; communities with inadequate access to clean air and safe drinking water; people with disabilities; LGBTQ; individuals with limited English proficiency . Socially disadvantaged groups, including all the following : The unhoused.

People identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. Individuals with limited English proficiency.2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 257 APPENDIX B SCRIPPS UNCOMPENSATED CARE METHODOLOGY FISCAL YEAR 20 21 Scripps continues to contribute resources to provide low and no- cost health care services to populations in need. During fiscal year 20 21, Scripps contributed $494,197,396 in uncompensated health care, $1 7,572,864 in charity care, $469,353,119 in Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $7,271,413 in bad debt. Schedule H Methodology \u2014 Schedule H requires the uncompensated care to be divided into four categories: Charity care, under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means - Tested Government Programs, Bad Debt, and under -reimbursed Medicare. Bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reportable under the Schedule H guidelines but do not count towards the community benefit totals. Thus, the categories are reported in a specific order/hierarchy. Charity Care and under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means -Tested Government Programs are counted first. Charity Care Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost- to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross charity adjustments. The following costs are excluded: Community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Traditional Charity Care is included in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 Schedule H Part I Line 7a. Medi -Cal Shortfall \u2014 The shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO, Medicare Capitated program at the hospitals, Medi -Cal, Medi- Cal HMO, and CMS primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: Net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus revenue from uncompensated care pools including Medi -Cal DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the Syn tellis Performance Solutions. The following costs are excluded: Charity adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 schedule H Part I Line 7b. In the State of California, the Medicaid program is called Medi -Cal. 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 258 Medicare and Medicare H MO Hospitals \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Bad Debt Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost- to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross bad debt adjustments less recoveries. The following costs are excluded: Bad debt adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal and CMS patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section A. Shortfall Methodology Clinics \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Provider Relief Fund \u2014 The World Health Organization designated COVID -19 as a global pandemic. Scripps received funding from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund . These distributions from the Provider Relief Fund are not subject to repayment, provided Scripps is able to attest to and comply with the terms and conditions of the funding, including demonstrating that the distributions received have been used for health care- related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID -19. The provider relief payments are accounted as a restricted grant and used to direct offset revenue related to costs. Hospital Provider Fee Program The State of California enacted legislation for a provider fee program to fund certain Medi -Cal coverage expansions. The provider fee program charges hospitals a quality assurance fee that is used to obtain federal matching funds for Medi -Cal with the 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 259 proceeds redistributed as supplemental payments to California hospitals that treat Medi - Cal patients. In February 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021, provider fee program. The Organizat ion's policy is to recognize program revenues and expenses on the accrual basis once the Federal waiver has been approved. Accordingly, all related supplemental payments have been recognized as revenue and related quality assurance fees have been recognized as expense as of September 30, 2021, and 2020. Federal and state payments received from these programs are included as provider fee revenue in total patient service revenue, and fees paid or payable to the state and California Health Foundation and Trust (CHFT) are included in provider fee expense in operating expenses . 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 260 APPENDIX C 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 261 APPENDIX D SAN DIEGO COUNTY HHSA GEOGRAPHIC SERVICES REGIONS70 Source: County of San Diego: https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/live_well_san_diego/indicators/Map_and_Re gional_Data.pdf Central North Coastal East North Inland North Central South Central San Diego Mid-City SoutheastSan Diego Carlsbad Del North San Diego Palomar/Julian Pauma Poway Ramona San Marcos Valley Center Coastal Elliott Kearny Mesa Mira Mesa Miramar Peninsula UniversityChula Vista Coronado National City South Bay Sweetwater 70These regions have been designated by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) for the purpose of service delivery. T he regions i nclude different sub- regional ar ea (SRA) gr oupings that t he regions de signated by t he San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG) 2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 262 APPENDIX E REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS SB 697 and Scripps History with Past Assessments Scripps Health has a long history of responding to the health needs of the communities it serves, extending beyond traditional hospital care to address the health care needs of the region's most vulnerable populations. In 1994, California legislators passed Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), which requires all private not -for-profit hospitals in the state to conduct a CHNA every three years. Since 1994, these programs have been created based on an assessment of needs identified through hospital data, community input, and major trends. Previous collaborations among not-for-profit hospitals, health care systems, and other community partners have resulted in numerous well regarded Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) reports. Information is gathered through the CHNA for the purposes of reporting community benefit, developing strategic plans, creating annual reports, providing input on legislative decisions, and informing the gen eral community of health issues and trends. Federal Requirements In 2010, Congress added several new requirements for hospital organizations to maintain federal income tax exempt status under Section 501 (r) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . One of the requirements set forth in Section 501 (r) of the Code is for each hospital organization to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three tax years. The requirement to conduct a CHNA applies to Scripps Health, which is a health system that operates four hospital facilities. In addition, Scripps Health must adopt a triennial Implementation Plan which is a separate written document to address certain community heal th needs identified in the CHNA. Additional information on the ACA requirements for nonprofit hospitals can be found at www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations .\" Required Components of the Community Health Needs Assessment Per I RS requirements, (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(b) (6) (i)) the following are components the CHNA must include: A description of the community served by the health system and how it was determined A description of the processes and methods used to conduct the assessment2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 263 A description of how the hospital organization considered input from people who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility Prioritized description of all the community health needs identified through the CHNA, as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing such health needs. A description of the existing health care facilities and other resources with the community available to meet the community health needs identified in the CHNA. An evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospitalfinished conducting its immediately preceding CHNA to address the significanthealth needs identified in the prior CHNA. Make the CHNA widely available to the public via the hospital's website. Required Components of the Implementation Strategy Provisions in the Affordable Care Act permit a hospital facility that adopts a joint CHNA report to also adopt a joint implementation strategy which, with respect to each significant health need identified through the joint CHNA, either describes how one or more collaborating facilities plan to address the health need or identifies the health need as one collaborating facilities do not intend to address. The join implementation st rategy adopted for the hospital facility must : (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(c) (4). Meet community health needs identified in the CHNA. Describe any needs identified in the CHNA that are not being addressed and the reasons for not addressing them Be clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility Clearly identify the hospital facility's particular roles and responsibilities in takingthe actions described in the implementation strategy, and the programs and resources the hospital facility plans to commit to such actions I nclude a summary or other tool that helps the reader easily locate those portions of the joint implementation strategy that relates to the hospital facility.2022 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 264 APPENDIX F SCRIPPS HEALTH FISCAL YEAR 20 21 COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS The list below highlights Scripps community health improvement programs and professional education and research programs by alphabetical order for Fiscal Year 2021 . 2-1-1 Community Health Information Exchange (CIE) A Matter of Balance: Managing Concerns About Falls Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Renewal Course American Heart Association Heart Walk -
