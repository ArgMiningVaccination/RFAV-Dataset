[Older Children and Young Adults with ASD](#) [Preparing for College:](https://www.parentcenterhub.org/wp-content/uploads/repo_items/guiding-questions-exiting-ntact.pdf) Preparing for college can be an overwhelming experience for both students and their parents. The Center for Parent Information and Resources has a helpful guide for those wanting to organize their thoughts and find an appropriate next step after graduating high school. Common Challenges College Students with ASD Face: Many college students with ASD can be successful academically, but the change from living at home with a strong support system and living on campus can be big. Some may find it beneficial to begin college courses at a community college and commute from home. This gives students the ability to uphold a stable support system at home while adjusting to the new course load college offers. While the classes in college may pose a new challenge to students academically, some may also struggle with executive functioning, such as switching between one task to another, staying on task, planning out their day, or organizing. Struggles with social situations can also add to the challenge of transitioning to college life. Social and emotional support systems can help ease the shift into college life. Classroom accommodations, as well as study skills and academic counseling, should also be considered when ASD students enter college. When touring potential colleges, it is important to ask about special programs and accommodations each school offers. Schools in GA with Programs Specific to ASD: Some colleges have specific programs designed for those with ASD in mind. There are currently 9 colleges throughout the state of Georgia that have programs designed for those with ASD and allow for a more easy transition into college living. [Click here for a list of colleges that offer programs for those living with ASD.](https://www.topcollegeconsultants.com/autism-in-college/) [Click here for more information about each school's programs and requirements.](http://www.gaipsec.org/includecollege.html) Helpful Resources for Preparing for College: School Counselors and IEP: Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Georgia educators must form an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for each student with ASD. IEPs are plans that are unique to the needs of each individual and are used to help each student achieve their academic goals. Talking with school counselors and other faculty members who play a role in your student's IEP is a great way to stay updated on your student's academic life. They are also a great source of information when it comes to helping you and your student prepare for the transition to college. [CollegeMAP: ](https://www.aane.org/resources/adults/lifemap-coaching/) CollegeMAP is a service offered by The Asperger/ Autism Network that matches ASD college students with a counselor.

Creating a Plan: [Take the Community-based Skills Assessment:](https://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/2018-08/Community-based%20Skills%20Assessment.pdf) This assessment was created in order to evaluate the skill level and capabilities of those diagnosed with autism to help the individual and/or family unit build a thorough plan for transitioning into independent living. This will aid in identifying areas of knowledge, strengths, skills, and challenges to focus and work on before the transition takes place. Each plan will be different for every person and the plan should always be a guide for improvement. Goals should be set with the individual in mind in order to progress toward achieving independence. Housing Options: Communal living can offer benefits such as companionship, emotional support, and interaction with those with similar likes and interests. [Click here to view communal housing options that are available in the United States.](https://www.autismhousingnetwork.org/housing/) [ASD in Women and Girls](#) What does ASD look like in girls? Although autism is more frequently diagnosed in boys, girls can be diagnosed with ASD too. The signs and symptoms of ASD can present differently in girls, which may cause girls with ASD to go un-diagnosed. Girls with ASD may show the following symptoms: - Social Masking/Camouflaging: Girls with ASD can blend into social scenes by mimicking the social behaviors they see neurotypical people (people without ASD) do. Examples of social masking/ camouflaging could be: mimicking hand gestures, postures, or mimicking vocal tones. - Scripting: Girls with ASD may sometimes make up a conversation in their heads and then rely on their memorized script in order to talk with others. The conversation that results may not appear natural or genuine and instead feel forced, unnatural, or rigid. - Well-Developed Linguistic Skills: In many cases, language skills (communicating verbally, non-verbally, and maintaining eye contact) are more developed in girls with ASD than in their male counterparts. As a result, a diagnosis of autism can be missed or delayed in girls with ASD because they may successfully reach linguistic milestones. - Few Repetitive Behaviors: While repetitive behaviors are common in boys with ASD, they are less common in girls with ASD. - Selective Mutism: Selective mutism may occur in social situations when an individual with ASD becomes overwhelmed. For example, girls with ASD may whisper, rarely speak, or not speak at all when at school, but have no problems communicating when at home. - More Mainstream Interests: People with ASD may have one specific passion, rather than a range of interests. In girls with ASD, the specific interest may be a topic that most girls already enjoy, such as horses, a popular TV show, or a band. Because interests tend to be more \"normal\" or mainstream, they may be overlooked and contribute to delayed diagnosis of ASD. - Girls with ASD may also struggle with: anxiety/depression, ADD/ ADHD, OCD or compulsive tendencies, body dysmorphia, or eating disorders. If you would like to learn more about how ASD presents in women and girls, please follow the links below: [The costs of camouflaging autism | Spectrum](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/costs-camouflaging-autism/) [Autism-It's Different in Girls](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/autism-it-s-different-in-girls/) [Are Girls With Autism Hiding in Plain Sight? - SPARK](https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/are-girls-with-autism-hiding-in-plain-sight/) What can delay an ASD diagnosis in girls? - Girls use Compensatory Behaviors: The use of camouflaging techniques, such as social masking, to hide difficulties in social situations can make girls with ASD less likely to be identified. Imitation of neurotypical social behaviors during a clinical assessment can also hinder physicians in being able to identify autistic traits. - Parental Concerns: Parents may be more likely to attribute atypical behaviors to ASD in boys than in girls because ASD had been previously thought of as a male disorder. Girls are more likely to receive an ASD diagnosis if their emotional and behavioral problems are extreme and obvious to parents. - Lack of Information/Resources: While there is an abundance of information about boys with ASD, there is a lack of helpful information available about girls with ASD. This can be detrimental during clinical assessment because parents may be less inclined to seek a diagnosis for daughters. - Clinician Bias: Because ASD is diagnosed in boys more frequently, clinicians may not consider ASD as an explanation for atypical behaviors present in girls. - Diagnostic Criteria: Symptoms of ASD in girls are not as readily recognized. Research experts have even expressed that male behavior and symptoms correspond more heavily with criteria listed in diagnostic manuals for ASD. Samples that were used to create the diagnostic criteria were primarily male, and there is very little research looking into the different presentations of ASD symptoms. This speaks to the possibility that the diagnostic criteria may not describe ASD symptoms demonstrated by girls as equally as it does in boys. - Co-existing Problems: Girls are at a greater risk for going undetected for ASD because they tend to display maladaptive traits, such as hyperactivity and aggression, to a lesser degree. Females with ASD are thought to experience more \"inward\" emotional stress which may contribute to misdiagnosis. Girls with ASD are also more likely to have a co-existing intellectual disability, which may mask signs and symptoms of ASD. [Considerations for Visiting the Doctor with an Autistic Child](#) Considerations for Visiting the Doctor's Office with an Autistic Child: Healthcare providers are accustomed to anxious patients. For individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), sensory issues, an aversion to physical contact, or changes in their daily routine could lead to a negative doctor's office visit. Fostering a positive medical experience during childhood can increase the likelihood that individuals with ASD will receive appropriate medical care throughout their lives. The patient's first experience can set the precedent for future office visits. Therefore, creating positive, impactful experiences that carry into adulthood will have a long-term beneficial impact. [Things families should do to prepare for a doctor's office visit:](https://www.carautismroadmap.org/going-to-a-medical-appointment) - Take the child to the office before the appointment to familiarize them with the environment. - Practice procedures before the appointment. - Remember to bring a communication system your child utilizes. Even if the child/adolescent has language, the visit may be anxiety-inducing and the child/adolescent may not be able to use the language they have. - Be cognizant of the child's routine to schedule the appointment at the right time (i.e: time of day, time the office is not busy, time least intrusive to child's daily routine). - Bring comfort items and/or items to distract the child's attention from the medical setting. - Remember to speak to the medical team in advance about any special accommodations the child may need, such as environmental modifications. - Inform healthcare providers about certain triggers or any sensory inputs that make the patient anxious. Video presentations to prepare families/patients with certain procedures: - An animated video on what to expect during a doctor's office visit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwx2Z69S0YA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwx2Z69S0YA) - Getting an x-ray.

If so, when is the best time during the day to schedule an appointment? - Does the child have any sensory sensitivities? - Healthcare providers may also: - Send paperwork and questionnaires to parents in advance of the appointment in order to minimize wait time. - Make small adjustments to the appointment to minimize wait times, time spent in large patient waiting areas, or the use of bright lights. Things healthcare providers should inform parents so they know what to expect: - Ask parents to bring accommodating items (like distractions, comfort items, special communication devices, etc.). - Discuss what exactly entails an office visit so parents can prepare children. - Discuss specific ways to calm the child down should they become anxious. Things providers should expect and anticipate before a visit: - REMEMBER TO GO SLOW! Take any necessary extra time or breaks to allow the patient to acclimate to the procedures or new environment. - Have distraction or comfort items available at the office in case it is necessary for an anxious child. in Social Media: Want to see what living with ASD is like?

EI consists of several different types of treatments and therapies that occur before or at 3 years old when the brain's plasticity is high. Studies have shown that the sooner a child receives intervention therapies, the better the chance of learning and progress. Some children with autism make so much progress that they are no longer considered to be on the autism spectrum when they are older. EI's Goal: To help children with autism spectrum disorder gain everyday life skills that normally develop during the first few years of life. [Click here for more information on early intervention for autism. ](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/treatments/early-intervention) Types of EI: - Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) - Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) - Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) - Discrete Trial Training (DTT) - Pivotal Response Training (PRT) - Ayres Sensory Integration - Speech therapy - Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC) - Floortime - Verbal Behavior Therapy Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA): - ABA's goal is to alter behavior through positive reinforcement. - One-on-one therapy - Utilizes antecedents and consequential events to identify patterns of behavior and reinforce certain behaviors. - An antecedent is an event that occurs immediately before a behavior and impacts a patient's current behavior. For example, a loud noise could be an antecedent, and screaming could be the behavior that follows. - A consequential event impacts whether that behavior will occur in the future when the antecedent is present. - ABA seeks to increase positive behaviors (e.g. communication skills, social skills, etc...) and decrease maladaptive behaviors (e.g. aggressive behavior, self-stimulatory behavior, etc...). [Click here to view a short clip on applied behavioral analysis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jFrBv4BKY) - The first step in ABA therapy is to identify the function that maladaptive behaviors serve for the patient. - ABA works on the premise that children engage in patterns of behavior because they \"work\" for the child. In other words, children engage in maladaptive behaviors because those behaviors caused an outcome the child wanted. For example, a Tim might hit Adam to get the toy monster truck that Adam was playing with. Although hitting is a maladaptive behavior if Adam gives Tim the truck, then Tim may believe that hitting is a good strategy for getting toys from other children. - Ultimately, ABA seeks to identify what a behavior \"does\" for the child, then teach the child replacement strategies for achieving their desired outcomes. - All 50 states have taken action to require insurance coverage for ABA. For more information, please see the IDEA Act and Ava's Law links under the \"Legal Requirements for Schools\" tab. - For more information about ABA, please see [The Autism Center of Ascension Sacred Heart's Introduction to Applied Behavioral Analysis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jFrBv4BKY). - For information on the efficacy of ABA, please see [Efficacy of Interventions Based on Applied Behavior Analysis for Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Meta-Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7265021/) [Early Start Denver Model (ESDM):](https://www.autismspeaks.org/early-start-denver-model-esdm) - The ESDM uses ABA methods to help the patients build positive relationships. ESDM therapists use play and joint activities to help patients perform real-life activities, and develop language skills. - Promotes \"turn-taking\" behavior and imitation. - Imitation: - Facilitate children to imitate the care-provider by pairing the desired behavior with positive reinforcement. - Care-provider does not give a specific set of instructions. [Click here to view a clip on the Early Start Denver Model.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8S-4457hM4) - Addresses all developmental domains. - Designed to improve several skills at once [4]. - Large time commitment may be challenging for certain households. - Please see the [Early Start Denver Model](https://youtu.be/D2dH1X_Ghyo)for a video example of an ESDM session. [Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS):](https://pecsusa.com/pecs/) - Uses pictures to help children with little or no language communicate. - Prompting and reinforcement strategies are used to teach children to exchange pictures for items they want. The goal is to encourage independent, un-prompted communication. - Through PECS training, children learn to make \"sentences\" using pictures. - Through PECS training, children: - Use pictures for speech. - Speak better or significantly better when using pictures. - Engage more in social interaction when using pictures. - Patients who may benefit from PECS may: - Not have imitation skills. - Have some speech, but speech may not be functional. - Have speech but don't initiate. - Have very limited speech without expansions or descriptions - Have speech that is difficult to understand by unfamiliar people - PECS therapy consists of 6 phases: - Phase 1: Children learn to exchange single pictures for items they want. - Phase 2: Still using single pictures, children use this new skill in different locations. - Phase 3: Children learn to discriminate between two different pictures. - Phase 4: Children learn to form simple sentences using an \"I want\" picture prompt. \"I want\" is followed by the picture of the desired item. Eventually, these sentences are expanded through adjectives and verbs. - Phase 5: Children learn to use pictures to answer questions. - Phase 6: Children expand sentence formation to make general comments. - You can buy communication picture sets [here](https://nationalautismresources.com/visual-support-starter-set/)and [here](https://nationalautismresources.com/communication-picture-card-sets/)! - To read more about PECS, please see the [National Autism Resources Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)](https://nationalautismresources.com/the-picture-exchange-communication-system-pecs/)webpage! - Video examples of PECS sessions can be seen here: [Discrete Trial Training (DTT):](https://www.appliedbehavioranalysisedu.org/how-is-discrete-trial-training-used-in-aba-therapy/) - DTT uses ABA methods to teach children discrete skills one at a time, then assembles those discrete skills to perform a single skill or behavior. - Useful in cases where the behavior is not apparently complex, but where being able to adopt the behaviors immediately would be difficult using other methods of ABA. - People on the \"low-functioning\" end of the autism spectrum might benefit from DTT for simple behaviors, such as asking someone if they want to play. - Learning the sounds of individual words or learning how to play with others could require separate discrete trials. - Treatment is mainly instructor-initiated rather than patient-initiated. - To learn more about DTT, please read [What is Discrete Trial Training?](https://www.autismspeaks.org/expert-opinion/what-discrete-trial-training) [Pivotal Response Training (PRT)](https://www.autismspeaks.org/pivotal-response-treatment-prt-0): - Focuses on arranging a child's environment to promote the use of certain items and then provides opportunities for the child to use those items in natural play. PRT therapy is tailored to the needs of each child. - Focuses on specific areas of child development, such as motivation, initiation of social interactions, self-regulation, and responding to multiple cues. - Indirectly improves other areas of social skills, behavior, and communication. - Utilizes motivation strategies to produce natural reinforcement. - Providers - Psychologists - Speech therapists - Special education teachers - It is helpful if the patient's entire family adopts PRT \"lifestyle.\" Meaning that for best results, the child's family should consistently use PRT techniques. - For more information about PRT, visit [Autism Speaks Pivotal Response Treatment](https://www.autismspeaks.org/pivotal-response-treatment-prt-0) [Sensory Integration Therapy:](https://www.autism.org/sensory-integration/) - Focuses on 3 basic senses: tactile (touch), vestibular (balance), and proprioceptive (body-awareness; internal stimuli). - Sensory integration therapy works on the premise that when one or more senses are over-or under-reactive to stimulation, learning skills that facilitate attention and awareness can reduce over-responsiveness. - Goals of Sensory Integration Therapy: - Provide the child with sensory information in order to \"train\" the central nervous system to be less responsive. - Teach the child strategies for processing and responding to sensory information. - Uses physical activities and exercises to help children learn to interpret and use sensory information more effectively. - Evaluation and treatment are performed by occupational therapists &/or physical therapists. - Designed to be part of wider programs that also include communication, behavioral and educational therapies. - To learn about occupational therapy and sensory integration therapy can work together, please see [How Occupational Therapy Helps with Sensory Integration Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-jqtlwfw5M). [Speech Therapy](https://www.autismspeaks.org/speech-therapy-autism): - Speech therapy can assess and treat communication disorders. - By improving specific areas of communication, speech therapy is able to improve overall social skills in people with ASD. - A speech therapist can help people with ASD by: - Strengthening facial muscles - Articulating speech sounds - Understanding body language - Matching facial expressions to emotion - Responding to questions - Modulating tone - Speech therapists also aid with feeding and swallowing challenges. - After evaluation by a speech therapist, an individualized plan is formed for patients, and therapy sessions can begin. Sessions can occur in several settings [11]: - Private clinics - Schools - as part of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) - Home - Community - Sign language, PECS, and other forms of alternative augmentative communication can also be a part of treatment. [Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC):](https://www.asha.org/practice-portal/professional-issues/augmentative-and-alternative-communication/) - AAC is communication that is used in place of speech when language is absent or not functional. - AAC is augmentative in that it can be used to supplement existing speech. - In ASD, AAC improves existing language and is a tool to help patients acquire expressive and receptive language. - AAC can also help with literacy development. - To learn more about speech therapy, see the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)-Certified Speech-Language Pathologist and Autism Spectrum Disorder flyer: [https://www.asha.org/siteassets/uploadedfiles/asha-slp-asd-flyer.pdf](https://www.asha.org/siteassets/uploadedfiles/asha-slp-asd-flyer.pdf) [Floortime:](https://pecsusa.com/pecs/) - Floortime is an alternative treatment to ABA therapy that focuses on 6 key milestones in childhood development to improve autism symptoms. - The 6 key milestones of floortime are: - Self-regulation and interest in the world - Engagement in relationships - Two-way communication - Complex communication - Emotional ideas - Emotional thinking - Through focusing on emotional development, floortime is thought to work indirectly on speech, motor, and cognitive skills. - Therapy sessions involve therapists and parents engaging children through enjoyable activities that emphasize back-and-forth play and expand circles of communication. Back-and-forth play develops the foundation for shared attention and engagement. - Providers are able to continually monitor the child's development, forming a better picture of where the child is developmentally - Sessions also include training for parents and caregivers on how to help children with ASD maintain focus. Parents are more hands-on in floortime therapy and receive guidance on how to update play for their child's individualized needs from a therapist. - Floortime therapy can be done by child psychologists, special education teachers, speech therapists, and occupational therapists - Parents can also learn techniques through workshops provided by [Greenspan Floortime for Parents](https://stanleygreenspan.com/floortime-parents) - To learn more about floortime, please see [Explaining DIR/Floortime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAqHJSiKtKY). [Verbal Behavior Therapy](https://www.autismspeaks.org/verbal-behavior-therapy): - Through the principles of BF Skinner and using ABA methods, verbal behavior therapy teaches communication and language skills by helping children with ASD connect words with their purpose - meaning that words can allow children to get things that they want or to communicate ideas. - Verbal Behavior Therapy uses a method called \"errorless learning.\" In errorless learning, therapists encourage patients to use words by providing prompts. For instance, if a therapist is trying to teach a child to ask for a book, the therapist may start by hold the book in front of the child and say \"book.\" Over time, rather than say \"book,\" the therapist may prompt the child by making a \"b\" sound. The goal of this training is to have the child ask for the book unprompted (having associated the word \"book\" with the physical object). - The prompts are reduced over time, and the student eventually no longer needs prompting to provide the correct response - Most programs involve at least 1 to 3 hours of therapy per week, which is a lesser time commitment than most other intervention programs. - To learn more about Verbal Behavior Therapy, please see [Autism Speaks Verbal Behavior Therapy](https://www.autismspeaks.org/verbal-behavior-therapy) - For an example of a Verbal Behavior Therapy session, please watch [ABA Therapy - Verbal Reasoning Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yceVT-1YvLA).

Obtaining a driver's license - If you're over 16 years old and have ASD you may be able to get a driver's license. Currently, there are no laws that prevent persons with autism from driving. - The Georgia DDS requires a note from a physician that specifies what accommodations their patient would need for the driving test. Telehealth For some people with ASD, receiving treatment using telehealth options might be the best way to go. Telehealth is a way for doctors to provide consultations and therapies to patients using electronic devices (iPads, tablets, smartphones, home computers, etc . . . ). For families with an autistic child, telehealth can save on transportation costs and can be done from the comfort of home. As a note, while telehealth can be a wonderful way for people with ASD to receive treatment, it should always be done under the guidance of a physician. Please see below for a list of telehealth options: - Services Atlanta, Cumming, Dublin, Lithonia, and Suwanee - Providers offer Home-based/Comprehensive or Focused ABA therapy, parent education and training, social skills programs, and Telehealth Services. - Services through Telehealth include - Parent Coaching & Behavior Management Support - Supervision of In-home ABA Sessions - Functional Behavioral Assessments - Behavior technician sessions - Group Therapy - Early Autism Services offers telehealth options for ABA therapy using electronic devices for families who live in rural areas. - Early Autism Services offers guidance for parents, behavior assessments, therapeutic services, and supervision of therapy services through telehealth. - These telehealth ABA services may be a right fit for families if: - They are in a remote location - Parents schedules have limited availability - The child's behavior changes when being watched - If parents/guardians reside in separate locations but both want to participate in the child's therapy sessions. - Early Autism offers a free consultation to get started.

There is a lot of information about ASD out there. Any Google search for ASD therapies or treatments will give you a nearly overwhelming number of things to try that \"parents swear by.\" But how do you know if they're safe? And, will those therapies actually work? Here we evaluated how scientifically-backed some of the more popular hypotheses of ASD, diets for ASD, and non-medical ASD treatments were. Do vaccines cause ASD? - Vaccines DO NOT cause Autism! There is no credible evidence to suggest that the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine or any childhood vaccination causes autism. Multiple studies have been conducted concerning the safety of childhood vaccinations and their link to autism, but no connection has been found. - Do Preservatives in Vaccines Cause Autism? Since the Anti-Vaxx movement began, some have called into question the use of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, in vaccines. After many studies concerning the safety of thimerosal, the scientific community determined that thimerosal is safe to use in vaccines and does not cause autism. Even though it is safe, thimerosal was removed or reduced to small amounts from almost all childhood vaccines as a precaution. - What Started the Anti-Vaccination (Anti-Vax) Movement? - In 1998, the former Dr. Andrew Wakefield published a paper where he claimed that the MMR vaccine may cause autism. Thus began the anti-vaxx movement. The original paper that began this movement was flawed. In fact, the publisher later redacted this paper. Andrew Wakefield's medical license was revoked as a result of the errors in this paper, and the scientific and medical communities rejected his claims about vaccines. Since the late 1990's many studies have been conducted to determine whether or not there is a link between autism and vaccines and to confirm the safety of vaccines. [You can read more about the history of vaccines and the history of the anti-vax movement here.](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism) [Read more about the flaws of the Wakefield study in more detail here.](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccines-and-other-conditions/vaccines-autism) More Resources on Vaccines and Thimerosal: Below is a list of scientific studies and resources that examined whether or not there was a link between autism and vaccines. The consistent conclusion was that there is no link between ASD and vaccines. - [Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908388/). This review was written to address three specific concerns that have been raised: - Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? - Does thimerosal, a preservative sometimes used in vaccines, cause autism? - Do vaccines simultaneously weaken a child's immune system? - This paper looks at many different studies and determined that: - The MMR vaccine does not cause autism. - Thimerosal does not cause autism. - Giving multiple vaccines at once is safe and does not overwhelm or weaken the immune system. [This website provides links to many studies that investigated whether vaccines caused autism if preservatives in vaccines caused autism, and other questions concerned parents may have.](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism/autism-and-vaccines/) [Here the CDC writes about the safety of vaccines and thimerosal. They also provide a list of scientific articles for further reading about vaccine safety.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html) [This informational poster provides summaries and citations to many of the studies conducted on the safety of thimerosal.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/cdcstudiesonvaccinesandautism.pdf) The Importance of Vaccinations - Protecting Your Child: By vaccinating your child, you are helping her immune system learn to recognize and fight off an illness before she even gets sick. Vaccines are a safe and effective way to protect a person from deadly and/or life-altering illnesses. [You can learn more about the importance of vaccinations here!](https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization#tab=tab_1) - Protecting the Community: Vaccinations not only protect the vaccinated individual, but they help protect the community from the disease as well! When many people are vaccinated in a community, it becomes harder for diseases to spread from one person to another. This concept is called \"herd immunity.\" Herd immunity is important because it helps protect those who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons. By vaccinating yourself and your family, you are helping prevent the spread of disease in your community! You can learn more about herd immunity below: Special Diets Gastrointestinal (GI) issues are frequently reported in people with ASD. As a result, it has been suggested that special diets may help alleviate GI discomfort and improve ASD symptoms generally. - Diet and Nutritional Challenges for those with ASD - Nutritional Deficiencies: Nutritional deficiencies are very common in kids with ASD. This can be because children with ASD may have a preference for specific foods and reject other food, leaving them with a limited diet. These unbalanced diets can lead to various kinds of holes in your child's nutrition. - Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms: GI issues are common among children with ASD. Common symptoms include: stomach pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting - Food Sensitivities: In some cases, the GI issues mentioned above may be the result of food sensitivity, which is common in children with ASD. Some of the more common food sensitivities are casein and gluten. - Gluten-Free Casein-Free Diet (GFCF) - What is Casein? Casein is a protein found in milks, eggs, yogurts, cheeses and other dairy products. Some individuals may be sensitive to this protein, causing GI issues. If casein is what is irritating an individual's stomach, then a casein-free diet may relieve some of the symptoms. - - What is Gluten? Gluten is a wheat protein found in many breads. Crackers, baked goods and cereals also contain gluten since many of these foods contain wheat products. Celiac disease, an autoimmune reaction to gluten, is common among those with autism. - Why are Gluten-Free Casein-Free Diets Popular? Gluten and casein sensitivities are common among those with autism. Some parents have claimed this diet has helped relieve some of their child's GI symptoms. Parents have also claimed that the GFCF diet helped improve their child's ability to concentrate and alleviated repetitive behaviors. - What do the Experts Say about the GFCF Diet? While a few parents have claimed improvements to their child's behavior and GI symptoms, multiple studies have shown that the GFCF diet has no impact on improving GI symptoms nor behavioral issues. Experts do not recommend starting on this diet unless your child has a casein or gluten sensitivity. There is a possible risk of nutrient deficiency due to the restrictive nature of this diet. Always speak to your doctor or a nutritionist before changing your child's diet. [See Here For More Resources for the GFCF Diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7651765/) [See Here for a review paper that explains the science behind the GFCF diet and discusses its efficacy.](https://www.childrensmn.org/educationmaterials/childrensmn/article/15864/gluten-free-casein-free-diet-for-autism-spectrum-disorder/) Sugar-Free Diet - Why do people try Sugar-Free Diets? Many children with autism also have hyperactivity disorders such as ADHD. Some believe that this hyperactivity can be linked to the amount of sugar consumed. Some parents have claimed that a sugar-free diet has helped their child's hyperactivity disorder. Because of this, some parents claim to have success in alleviating behavioral issues their child with ASD may have. - What do the Experts Say about Sugar-Free Diets? There is very little research to back up these claims that a sugar-free diet helps those with autism. In fact, the link between hyperactivity disorders and sugar intake is still being investigated. Some research shows that the consumption of high sugar foods had no effect on hyperactivity in children. Other research suggests a link between insulin release and autism. Much more research needs to be done before the scientific community can make a final conclusion about the effect of a sugar-free diet on autistic or hyperactive children. Always speak with your physician before changing your child's diet. Ketogenic Diet (KD): - What is a ketogenic diet? A ketogenic diet consists of a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. By consuming a high amount of fat and a low amount of carbohydrates, the body uses the fats to create a substance called \"ketone bodies,\" which the brain uses for energy. You may have heard of this kind of diet before. In recent years, it has become a popular diet for weight loss but has also been shown to have the potential for helping those who have ASD and/or epilepsy. - Why do some parents try a ketogenic diet for children with ASD? Individuals with autism can sometimes also have epilepsy (recurrent seizures). Alongside other preventative measures and/ or medications, a ketogenic diet has been shown to help prevent seizures in some. In addition, some studies have shown that a ketogenic diet helped improve their child's behavioral symptoms. Because of these two things, some parents try the ketogenic diet in hopes of preventing seizures in their child and to help better the behavioral symptoms associated with ASD. - What do the experts say about a ketogenic diet? Studies have shown a ketogenic diet to be beneficial in helping to prevent seizures when used alongside other preventable treatments like anti-seizure medications. Some studies have also reported that a ketogenic diet improved behavioral symptoms in children with ASD. Scientists believe this diet helps those with ASD by decreasing inflammation, balancing out certain neurotransmitters in the brain, and regulating bacteria in the gut. Overall, the ketogenic diet shows promise as a therapy for ASD. - Are there any risks to starting a ketogenic diet? While a ketogenic diet as a therapy for ASD does sound promising, some side effects of this diet have been noted. Always speak with your doctor or nutritionist before changing your child's diet. - Common side effects in children: GI issues such as constipation and vomiting, lack of energy, complaints of hunger - Risk of nutritional deficiencies: Many children with ASD are picky eaters and only eat a limited number of foods. Because of the restrictive nature of this diet, they may be even more limited in the foods that they eat, leading to nutritional deficits. - Long-term use of this diet in older individuals may lead to High cholesterol, hyperuricemia (high amounts of uric acid in the blood), and kidney stones Probiotics - What are probiotics? Proponents of probiotics advocate for ingesting amounts of live \"good\" bacteria and/or yeast to promote good health. In particular, probiotics are thought to restore or improve the microbiota of the gut. Though probiotics are generally thought to be safe, it is important to consult with your primary care provider prior to starting probiotics to ensure that they could be of benefit in treating GI symptoms. - Why do some people with ASD use probiotics? Compared to their typically developing peers, children and adults with ASD tend to have more GI symptoms, such as abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. One concern regarding the health of children with ASD is the tendency to only eat a few foods (selective eating), sometimes preferring processed foods to fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Using probiotics has been shown to help and prevent and relieve GI symptoms experienced by those with ASD. In addition, recent studies have recognized a microbiota-gut-brain axis as a key modulator of neuropsychiatric health-improving general health, depression, anxiety, and stress. Probiotics have beneficial effects regardless of ASD diagnosis and could be helpful in relieving some of the GI symptoms present. Encouraging a balanced healthy diet is also helpful in preventing GI distress. - For more information about probiotics, please see the articles below: Music Therapy - What is music therapy? Music therapy is the clinical use of music to accomplish individual goals such as reducing stress, improving mood and self-expression. It is an evidence-based therapy that may include listening, singing, composing music, or play instruments. - Does music therapy work? There is evidence both supporting and denying the efficacy of music therapy. Research supporting music therapy claims that it reduces anxiety and can alleviate social problems in children with ASD. However, other studies found that music therapy has no effect on improving social flexibility, responsiveness, or attentiveness. It is also possible that different people may achieve different results with intervention. It is important to note that music therapy should be discussed with your primary care provider to ensure efficacy and proper utilization of this intervention. To learn more about music therapy in ASD, please see the articles below: [Music therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956617/) - Summary: This study assessed music therapy in those with autism spectrum disorder in randomized controlled trials with groups consisting of music therapy, standard care, and no treatment. The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in primary outcome areas that constitute the core of the condition including social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behavior, and social-emotional reciprocity. Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context. Furthermore, in secondary outcome areas, music therapy may contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships. In contrast to the studies included in an earlier version of this review published in 2006, the new studies included in this update enhanced the applicability of findings to clinical practice. More research using larger samples and generalized outcome measures is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring. When applying the results of this review to practice, it is important to note that the application of music therapy requires specialized academic and clinical training. [Music interventions for children with autism: a narrative review of the literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21203898/) - Summary: This is a literature review emphasizing the contradiction in support of music therapy in those with ASD. After searching relevant databases, 128 articles were identified, of which, 20 articles met the study's inclusion criteria. Composed songs and improvisational music therapy were the predominant music techniques used. There was somewhat limited evidence to support the use of music interventions under certain conditions to facilitate social, communicative, and behavioral skills in young children with autism. The implications of these findings in terms of the use of music interventions, issues related to generalization and maintenance, and future research are discussed. [The Effect of Music Therapy and Aromatherapy with Chamomile-Lavender Essential Oil on the Anxiety of Clinical Nurses: A Randomized and Double-Blind Clinical Trial.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175441/) - Summary: This study aimed to determine the anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects of music therapy, lavender essential oil, and chamomile essential oil. The study was performed by nurses and measured anxiety after usage of the targeted methods. Results showed that the interventions of music therapy and chamomile-lavender essential oil could reduce the anxiety of the participants and were recommended for use. Animal Therapy - What is Animal Therapy? Animal therapy is utilized based on the pre-existing human-animal bond. Animal therapy has been shown to have a beneficial effect on various physical and mental conditions. Studies show that it can help reduce blood pressure and improve overall cardiovascular health. - Does it help people with ASD? One aspect of animal therapy that may benefit those with ASD is that this intervention can trigger a release of endorphins, which can produce a calming effect. It should be noted, however, that credible positive research for animal therapy is sparse and that support animals may come with safety, sanitation, and allergies concerns. - Is it safe? Accredited organizations that perform animal therapy have processes for ensuring that animal therapy is suitable for individuals with ASD and treatment is personalized for each patient. Consultation with your primary care provider is essential to find an appropriate animal accustomed to each. When contacting animal therapy providers, ask about their qualifications. - If you would like to learn more about music therapy in ASD, please see the articles below: [Pet Therapy](https://www.healthline.com/health/pet-therapy) [Animal-assisted Intervention for Autism](https://vet.purdue.edu/chab/ohaire/autism.php) - Summary: Research is conducted by OHAIRE Lab at Purdue University about animal therapy benefits to those with ASD. Some reasons researched and supported by this source are positive effects on social facilitation, attentional focus, and nonjudgmental companions. The source states the need for high-quality research supporting this intervention and how to further rigorous research is underway. - - [Autism and Equine-Assisted Interventions: A Systematic Mapping Review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28733851/) - Summary: This systematic mapping review organized current knowledge of equine-assisted interventions for people with autism to help guide future practice and research. The study stated that although literature reflected early scientific development, it offered broad proof of concept that equine-assisted interventions can benefit children and adolescents with ASD. - - [Companion animals and human health: benefits, challenges, and the road ahead for human-animal interaction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30209428/) - Summary: This study emphasizes the benefits and challenges of human-animal interaction associated with health. The health benefits demonstrated typically include reductions in depression and loneliness while enhancing social interaction or social skills, and decreasing anxiety and arousal. Other benefits are the encouragement and promotion of physical activity or exercise. Problems associated with human-animal interactions are high expense, allergies, asthma, zoonoses, animal bites and scratches, and human falls. There are inconsistent policies permitting animals into public places as well as housing developments. The study states that additional research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of each type of animal therapy intervention on the overall health of humans. - Essential Oils - Essential Oils and ASD: Some people consider the use of essential oils to be a useful holistic care method. A variety of essential oils have been suggested as possible remedies for ASD symptoms. There is minimal research on the beneficial effects of essential oils on individuals with ASD. - There are claims by parents of children with ASD that the essential oils listed below can potentially reduce behaviors such as anger, anxiety, attention deficit, hyperactivity, sensory overload, sleep issues, and meltdowns. With the use of any essential oils, there is a risk of allergic reaction. Essential oils should not be ingested, applied undiluted to the skin, or overused. All essential oils are not regulated by the FDA; therefore, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider prior to use of the following: - Vetiver is an essential oil used as aromatherapy that could help treat nervousness, insomnia, and joint and muscle pain. There is little accredited research done to prove vetiver aromatherapy as a beneficial holistic care method for individuals with ASD; however, it has been shown to have some antimicrobial factors as well as positive effects on insomnia - Cedarwood is an essential oil used as aromatherapy originally to prevent moths from eating clothing and repelling ants. Further research revealed that it may benefit acne treatment, antibiotic activity, pain relief, decrease swelling, decrease inflammation, stress relief, anxiety relief. Research has also suggested that cedarwood can promote better sleep and help lengthen sleeping time when used with a diffuser. EPA states there are no safety concerns with use. Essential oils can cause skin irritations; however, few have been reported with cosmetics use. There is minimal accredited research supporting the benefits for individuals with ASD; however, the benefits discovered could show beneficial results for poor sleep and anxiety. - Frankincense is aromatherapy that is still being researched but has shown promising results in calming and relaxing, promoting higher levels of consciousness, and regenerating cells. Many essential oils used as aromatherapies are not regulated by the FDA and could cause allergic reactions when used on the skin. Small doses are encouraged when applied to the skin and when used as aromatherapy. The research for this essential oil is in its early stages, and doctors are not ready to make wide-ranging declarations about the effectiveness of frankincense on an ongoing basis. Speaking with your primary care physician prior to use is encouraged prior to use. - Lavender is an essential oil used for calming and relaxing, improving sleep, promoting healing, relieving pain, having antibacterial properties, and potentially improving memory. The research involving lavender and individuals with ASD have mixed results supporting its effectiveness at improving sleep, although some parents support putting a few drops in bathwater prior to bed. With all essential oils, there is a risk of allergic reactions; therefore, spot testing and beginning with small amounts is encouraged. Lavender can be inhaled or applied to the skin as a lotion. When applying to the skin, it is encouraged for the oil to be diluted and not potent to prevent skin irritation. - Mandarin is an essential oil used for its beneficial effects attributed to specific properties such as antispasmodic, antiseptic, digestive, nervous relaxant, and sedative. It can be used with a diffuser as aromatherapy or applied to the skin. There is a potential for skin irritation; therefore, essential oils should not be applied to the skin undiluted or ingested. If applied to the skin, it is important to ensure the oil is not oxidized to prevent irritation, and the oil is confirmed not to be phototoxic. Research on Mandarin essential oil and ASD; however, parents have claimed that it is particularly easy to use as aromatherapy for anxiolytic purposes because the children are fond of the scent. - Peppermint is an essential oil used for GI distress, sinus congestion relief, anxiety relief, decrease in sensory overload, and headaches. There have been possible side effects noted with ingestion such as heartburn, flushing of the skin, headache, mouth sores, and diarrhea. A small dosage is recommended as well as consultation with primary care providers prior to use. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid use due to little research performed about their safety during pregnancy and lactation. Research is lacking in the benefits of peppermint essential oil and individuals with ASD. There are potential benefits claimed by parents praising the calming effects and cooling sensations on the body. - Ylang ylang is an essential oil used for its positive effects on human emotions, alleviating anxiety, and increasing blood flow to parts of the body. As with any essential oil, it is imperative to dilute the essential oil prior to application on the skin. Ylang ylang essential oil has been linked to contact dermatitis, and it has been proven to be poisonous to dogs and cats. Research on ylang ylang essential oils in relation to individuals with ASD is limited, so the effects and benefits are not definite. - Bergamot is an essential oil used in aromatherapy helping to create a feeling of joy, freshness, and energy by improving blood circulation. Practitioners of aromatherapy believe that inhaling essential oils or absorbing through the skin transmits signals to the limbic system (the region of the brain that regulates emotions and memories). Some of the main uses of bergamot essential oil are acne, anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, headache, insomnia, and depression. The evidence supporting these claims is weak and only has a few positive findings in small clinical studies. As with any essential oil, topical application can cause skin irritation and should be diluted. Research with Bergamot essential oil and individuals with ASD yield varying results; therefore, the benefits of this essential oil in improving anxiety and sensory overload are questionable. - Chamomile is a popular essential oil for its various claims to have anti-inflammatory effects, pain-reducing abilities, anxiety relief, sleep improvement, congestion relief, and improvement in digestion. There is limited accredited research on the benefits of chamomile essential oil and individuals with ASD. Studies supporting various claims such as GI support, improvements with generalized anxiety disorder, depression reduction, and sleep aid may have some benefits to those with ASD. Consultation with your primary care provider is encouraged prior to use.
