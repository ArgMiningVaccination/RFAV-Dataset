Roses carry one of the purest & highest vibrations known in nature's plant kingdom, vibrating at 320 MHz, the human body vibrates at a frequency somewhere between 62-78 MHz. Roses have an innate wisdom and know exactly where healing is most needed, with sacred geometry ratio of 1.62803 ~ which is the same number that a heart experiencing love resonates at. Rose medicine is a heart opener & rooted in the Divine Feminine. The Rose Healing Ceremony, an ancient shamanic ritual from Mexico, is a powerful healing tool for physical ailments, emotional issues, negative thoughts, spiritual blocks and for boosting resilience. The rose energy can also bring up memories from the past that are now ready to be transmuted and released into Love. The rose is the Virgin Mary's flower, otherwise known as Virgen De Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. Roses work similarly to Reiki, where their gentle vibration heals through nurture + support. Prior to the Ceremony, You will receive a worksheet with specific questions to help you connect to your intentions for the Ceremony. Every Rose colour possesses a unique frequency - your subconscious will know exactly which one you need for healing. Therefore, it's important that you purchase your own roses. You'll arrive at your appointment with your pre-selected long-stem dozen roses (A simple $7-$10 bouquet from the grocery store works) After a brief discussion together, I conduct a short ritual with the Roses to begin invoking their energetic qualities and guide you in connecting with them. You'll lay fully clothed and I will intuitively lay the roses, one by one, on your body, wherever they guide me to place them. The connection I create with the Roses gives me the ability to read their cues and place them strategically over the parts of your body where blocked energy is being stored. Once all the roses have been laid on the body, you will be guided through a Shamanic Journey. Intuitive Energy Healing will be performed to amplify, support and encourage the Roses' absorption of your energetic blocks. The Roses are removed and gathered for you to take home, to continue your connection with them. We close with a brief discussion of reflection & insight, and instructions on how to respectfully discard them once they have served you.
