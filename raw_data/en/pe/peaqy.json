A dietitian shares what you need to know to get the results you crave. 6 min read You've seen the ads popping up all over social media: \"3 Day Detox,\" \"Detox Juice Cleanse,\" or \"How to Detox Your Body in One Day.\" These days, lots of people are researching how to do a juice cleanse and look to detox diets as a jump-start for a healthy eating plan and to take off some pounds. \"People are looking to start fresh and to cleanse their bodies,\" says Nina Eng, chief clinical dietitian for Northwell Health's Plainview Hospital. The payoff does sound promising: Flush the toxins from your system and you'll be left with more energy, a better functioning immune system and quick weight loss. But do detox drinks work? It turns out it's not that simple ... \"Toxins are poisons\u2014in this case molecules that need to be removed from the body,\" explains Eng. They fall into two main categories: Endotoxins are produced inside the body as a result of your day-to-day metabolism, while exotoxins come from the environment and get into your body through breathing, eating, drinking, or skin absorption. Each person's ability to detoxify varies, based on dozens of different factors, including things like diet, lifestyle, health status, and genetic factors. However, most human bodies come with their own built-in natural detox system. \"Metabolically, our bodies act as a natural filtration system to aid in eliminating toxins through the liver and kidneys,\" says Eng. But maybe you think your liver and kidneys could use a little help. Should you give detox diets a whirl? Probably not, says Eng. Here are some facts to consider before diving right in: By providing your email address, you agree to receive email communication from The Well. If you do want to try a detox for two to three days and have gotten the go-ahead from your health care provider, you can do it in a healthful way. A good detox keeps you from putting toxins into your body and increases nutrients to support its natural detoxification process. You don't have to follow any strict rules or forbid any foods. A \"healthy detox\" incorporates consuming an overall healthful diet to promote optimal function of all metabolic systems. The key components of this diet include adequate fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grain sources, lean animal and plant-based proteins, heart-healthy fats, and optimal fluid intake. Here are some additional guidelines Eng offers to help optimize your health: Here's a sample healthy day of detoxifying foods according to Eng: 30 to 35 mL/kg of water multiplied by body weight (kg) 1 multivitamin Breakfast: Breakfast frittata made with 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites, onions, garlic, leeks, and green and red peppers. One-half cup berries. One slice whole wheat toast, plain. Green tea. Snack: One-half cup plain low- or no-fat yogurt or kefir sprinkled with 1/8 cup mix of almonds and sesame seeds.
