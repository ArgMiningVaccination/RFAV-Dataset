Eisenberg, MD Editor's Note :Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile. The phrase comes to mind in reflecting on the actual reach of a movement, nominally about food, that is on display in the ''teaching kitchens'' that are gaining stature nationally and globally in hospitals,corporations, and other institutional settings. The rst paragraphs of this commentary from David Eisenberg, MD, the founder of the Teaching Kitchens Collaborative, introduce the multi-faceted ''culture of health'' that these institutional healing agents promote. JACM is again honored to partner with Eisenberg and the Teaching Kitchen Research Conference to publish the abstracts of their 2020 meeting. Eisenberg invites you into these emerging outposts of whole health then guides you through highlights of themeeting, and of the scientic presentations. Read on and you will likely agree that my framing at the top of this note wasn't quite right. Better to say: Give 'em an inch and they'll give you miles of life better and more healthily lived. \u2014John Weeks, Editor-in-Chief Teaching kitchens, as currently designed and im- plemented across the United States and globally, have been designed as learning environments that include a kitchen;however, they are more than culinary instruction sites. Teaching kitchens typically include instruction in most, if not all, of the following: (1) nutrition education, specicallywhat to eat more of or less of and why; (2) hands-on culi-nary instruction, that is, basic cooking skills for the home cook; (3) information about physical activity and its critical importance in health optimization; (4) mindfulness and itscritical relationship to diet, portion control, satiety, and re- silience; (5) the judicious use of web-based resources and information technologies; (6) the relationship between foodchoices and the environment; and (7) motivational inter- viewing strategies and health coaching techniques whereby personal motivations can be identied and leveraged tosuccessfully achieve sustained behavioral change. 1 Emerging teaching kitchen models serve as real or virtual life skills learning laboratories intended to promote health and wellness, and as clinical research centers whereby theimpact of diet and lifestyle change on a range of behavioral, metabolic, genetic, clinical, and nancial variables can be rigorously evaluated. The conceptual origins of teaching kitchens include two philosophical tenets from both ancient China and ancient Greece: 1. Prevention is always superior to intervention.2InThe Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine ,2at- tributed to the Legendary Yellow Emperor\u2014who was believed to have lived from 2700 BC to 2600 BC\u2014this tenant is conveyed poetically as follows: ''To admin-ister medicine to diseases which have already devel- oped and thereby suppress bodily chaos, which has already occurred, is comparable to the behavior ofthose who would begin to dig a well after they had grown thirsty or those who would begin to cast weapons after they have engaged in battle. Wouldthese actions not be too late.'' 2 2. The way we eat, move, and think impacts our health, and determines our recuperative capacity.2 In addition, both Chinese and Greek medical thought leaders of the 5th century B.C. appreciated that one's ''constitution,'' as referenced by Hippocrates, and one's''ancestral Qi'' also known as ''vital energy'' in Chinese theory, are also determinants of one's health and resilience. Accordingly, modern teaching kitchens can be viewed as''learning laboratories'' and ''translational research centers'' where the relationships between food, health, our environ- ment, and the regulation of our genes (and microbiota) canbe rigorously studied. The rst ever Teaching Kitchen Research Conference (TKRC) was held in February 2018, 3hosted by the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (Harvard Chan School)in association with the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative (teachingkitchens.org), an invitational network of >30 in- stitutions with teaching kitchens dedicated to the develop-ment of best practices and the creation of a research network whereby teaching kitchens can be systematically evaluated, rened, and scaled for maximum impact (Appendix A1). The second TKRC recently took place in November 11- 12, 2020. Due to generous support from a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH; R13AT010554-01 from Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINEJACMVolume 26, Number pp. 971-975 \u00aaMary Ann DOI: 10.1089/acm.2020.29087.dme 971 Downloaded Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers from www.liebertpub.com at 11/20/20. For personal use only. the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health) and from unrestricted grants from the Meshewa Farm Foundation and the Campus for Health, LTD (Japan),the conference had the resources to provide free registrationto anyone interested in participating. In addition, this con- ference was formally endorsed by both the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health and by theAmerican College of Lifestyle Medicine. Although the 2018 in-person TKRC was held in Cali- fornia and attracted 125 registrants from the United Statesand a small number of registrants from abroad, 3this second 2020 TKRC was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pan- demic and attracted >2100 registrants from 75 countries. More than 800 registrants conrmed the existence ofteaching kitchens within their respective institutions. This highlights how teaching kitchens are becoming more ubiq- uitous and are being designed and implemented for educa-tional and research purposes across the international community. These gures also demonstrate that the desire to share ''best practices,'' novel educational models, andemerging research ndings within and across teaching kitchens has increased considerably since 2018. The 2020 TKRC included keynote presentations from ve speakers in addition to plenary: 24 oral abstract presenta- tions, 37 poster presentations, and 2 panel discussions.* The panel discussions focused on (1) methods currently in placeto use teaching kitchens to educate health care professionalsand (2) research challenges and opportunities involving the evaluation of teaching kitchens during and after the COVID- 19 global pandemic. Importantly, each keynote presentationwas recorded and can be publicly viewed on demand (please visit https://teachingkitchens.org/Recordings for more in- formation). Highlights of the TKRC welcome and keynote presenta- tions, and a selection of oral abstracts, are briefly summa- rized hereunder. David Eisenberg, director of Culinary Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and principal investigator of this NIH-sponsored research conference, provided a welcome and overview of the eld. He discussedthe development of teaching kitchens in the context of the annual educational conference, ''Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives'' (www.healthykitchens.org) cosponsored by theHarvard T. H. Chan School and the Culinary Institute of America and offered to health care professionals since 2006; the launch of the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative (www.teachingkitchens.org), an invitational network of organiza- tions with teaching kitchens committed to building best practices and to the evaluation of teaching kitchen inter-ventions with respect to changes in behaviors, clinical out-comes, and costs; and the launch of a new ''Food is Medicine Map'' (found at https://teachingkitchens.org/map- m) being built for the purpose of identifying and show-casing teaching kitchen programs, as well as other ''Food Is Medicine'' programs, nationally and globally. Dr. Eisenberg also described current challenges in light of the COVID-19pandemic and ongoing efforts by Teaching Kitchen Colla- borative members to ''pivot'' from in-person instruction tovirtual teaching platforms. Lastly, Dr. Eisenberg shared thoughts about the design, use, and evaluation of teaching kitchens of the future in both the working and learning en-vironments. 1 Frank Hu, chair of the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, provided a keynote presentation on ''The Role of Teaching Kitchens inPrecision Nutrition Research and Practice.'' After describ- ing the recently published 2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research,4Dr. Hu provided an overview of the eld of precision nutrition, including advances in ge- nomics and other omics technologies. Dr. Hu proposed that teaching kitchens can be used as (1) precision nutrition re-search laboratories, (2) educational venues for current andfuture nutrition professionals, (3) natural experimental set- tings to evaluate diet and lifestyle effects across teaching kitchen venues and populations, (4) instructional classroomsto translate research ndings into practice, and (5) platforms for promoting sustainability to a global audience. Richard Rothstein, chair of the Department of Medicine at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, provided a plenary presentation entitled: ''Teaching Kitchens in Aca- demic Health Systems: Superfluous, Advocated or Essen-tial?'' Professor Rothstein discussed the need for changes in medical education and training with regard to competencies relating to nutrition information and advice. He conveyedthat teaching kitchens, functioning as learning laboratories,have demonstrated clinically meaningful outcome improve- ments, that evidence is accumulating for their incorporation into future health care systems, and that future research inthis area will not only lead to scientic discovery and dene the impact of teaching kitchens, but also provide the nec- essary nancial capital to build and sustain such programs inthe future. He discussed the role of teaching kitchens in the emerging ''Food is Medicine'' movement, the role teaching kitchens can play in reshaping the food landscape withinhospitals and health systems for patients and communities,and mentioned the additional value of teaching kitchens as powerful ''antidotes'' to burnout among health care provid- ers. Teaching kitchens, Dr. Rothstein argued, can improvethe quality and reduce the costs of health care. Nicole Farmer, research scientist at the NIH Clinical Center, presented a plenary entitled, ''Translational Preci-sion Nutrition: Teaching Kitchens and Precision Nutrition of the Future.'' She conveyed that precision nutrition research, across the NIH and elsewhere, should include but not belimited to the study of genomics and omic-related technol- ogies, but rather also include research involving cooking and other relevant self-care behaviors. She added that suchresearch must simultaneously contend with the relevance ofsocial determinants of health on self-care behaviors and outcomes, and should investigate how teaching kitchens can and should be studied in the context of research aimed atreducing health disparities, especially during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Ruthie Schwab , Global Food Program Manager, Google, Inc., and Zoe Schweitzer , Global User Enablement Program Manager, Compass at Google, co-presented a plenary enti- tled, ''Google as a Case Study for Corporate Food Educa-tion.'' They described ''Food at Google'' and the role of teaching kitchens over the past several years and more re- cently in the context of COVID, as well as ''learnings'' from *JACM reference for details regarding all 2020 TKRC research abstracts.972 EISENBERG Downloaded by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers from www.liebertpub.com at 11/20/20. For personal use only. this past year. They described how teaching kitchens have been used to enable Google employees to engage, to con- vene, to learn about, and co-create food; strengthen teamsand foster connections; and to create unique experiences thatinspire deeper interest in food system-related values and communities. In addition, they described ongoing efforts to pivot from in-person to digital teaching kitchen classes andto develop new ''food at home'' sites specically for their large employee population. They also shared Google's evolving metrics whereby the performance of Google'sTeaching Kitchens will be measured over time. A number of original scientic abstracts included in the TKRC are noteworthy. These include: /C15The abstract by Berquist et al. (original abstract [OA]1.01) describes the evaluation of Emory Uni- versity's ''Healthy Kitchen Multi-Disciplinary Teaching study, benets-eligible Emory employees (n=37) were offered a multi-disciplinary teaching kitchen educational intervention in the form of ve 4- hour classes. This teaching kitchen model was feasible and effective as a strategy to increase health-promotingbehaviors among an employee population. /C15The abstract by Roderka et al. (OA1.02) describes ''AClinic-Community Partnership to Address PediatricObesity.'' This 12-week multi-disciplinary interven-tion, involving 29 subjects, performed by staff of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Culinary Medicine Program and Geisel School of Medicine, suggests that a referral-based community lifestyle program for children with obesity was feasible, acceptable, and potentially ef- fective in changing health behaviors. /C15The abstract by Luchsinger et al. (OA2.04) describes a ''Collaborative Enhanced Nutrition Care Program for Adults with Serious and Persistent Mental Illness'' atthe Kalamazoo Valley Community College. This pro-gram, which integrates culinary medicine into behav- ioral health services and includes the incorporation of culinary training using a mobile kitchen unit, was foundto have multiple positive impacts on subjects ( n=27) with serious and persistent mental illness. As an edi- torial note, this study suggests the need for futurestudies involving teaching kitchens as applied to a range of patient populations treated by behavioral, mental health, and rehabilitation specialists. /C15The abstract by LaCroix et al. (OA4.02) describes ''Baseline Knowledge, Habits and Condence of the Veterans Health Admini stration (VHA) Healthy Teaching Kitchen Partici pants.'' Data from 1373 participants from 36 VHA Healthy Teaching Kitchen sites suggest that most U.S. veterans who participate in teaching kitchen programs are older males withobesity who do not meet the recommended daily re- quirements with regard to vegetable, fruit, bean, and nut consumption, and who could benet from en-hanced meal planning and teaching kitchen-related instruction. /C15The abstract by Jacobs et al. (OA4.03) described ''In- novative Food Procurement Guidelines'' applied to 10 hospitals within the Northwell Health System, the largest health system in the Greater New York region.These novel ''healthy quality food initiatives,'' based on explicit Northwell Health food procurement guide- lines, were initiated in June 2016. Between 2016 and2020, Press Gainey Scores relating to the question:''How would you rate the quality of your food'' rose from 9% (2016) to 56% (2019); total food purchases of $35 million at baseline rose by only 3% (identical to thecost of living increase over this same period); standards were raised with regard to the purchase of meats and sh; and a range of healthier\u2014and well received\u2014fooditems, including healthier (non-prefried) potatoes, arti- sanal (whole grain) breads, and healthier desserts were incorporated into standard hospital dining programs.The authors conclude ''It is possible to apply evidence-based food procurement policies to improve nutritional value and quality of hospital-based foods while in- creasing customer/patient satisfaction without signi-cant increases in food expenditures.'' /C15The abstract by Steinberg et al. (OA4.04) entitled,''Evaluating the Impact of Kaiser Permanente's ThriveKitchen Culinary Medicine Program on Healthy Eating and Cooking Condence and Behaviors,'' describes changes in cooking condence and health-related be-haviors among 362 participants who attended teaching kitchen classes at the mobile teaching kitchen at Kaiser Permanente, San Francisco, between 2017 and 2019. Themajority found these classes to be useful, learned newskills, gained condence, and were inspired to improve their eating and cooking habits. /C15The abstract by Westfall et al. (OA5.03) entitled, ''Teaching Kitchen Improves Health Professional Stu- dents' Nutrition Knowledge, Perceived Culinary Skills, and Condence Providing Nutritional Counseling'' de-scribes a study in which UCLA students of medicine, nursing, dentistry, and public health were recruited through e-mail to participate in a ''Teaching KitchenIntervention.'' Based on pre-post data from 85 partici-pants, this educational intervention resulted in signicant improvement in students' nutrition knowledge, culinary skills, and condence-providing nutritional counseling. /C15Additional abstracts offer a sense of the diversity of teaching kitchen applications being evaluated in 2020 and include abstracts describing teaching kitchen pro-grams in: (1) A publicly funded city library (the Philadelphia Free Library Culinary Literacy Center) where teaching kitchen programs are offered to new im- migrants using teaching kitchen classes to learnEnglish as a second language, to teach cookingskills to adults with disabilities, and to teach nu- trition facts and culinary skills to inner city youth and others (i.e., >6200 students per year in 2019) (postal abstract [P]-4.08); (2) an OB/GYN practice in Boston (at Brigham and Women's Hospital) for pregnant women with ahistory of gestational diabetes (OA2.02); (3) an RD training program at the University of Texas School of Public Health that requires evidence ofcompetencies involving both culinary instruction and instruction in the design and implementation of family home vegetable gardens (P-5.10);TEACHING KITCHEN RESEARCH CONFERENCE NOVEMBER 973 Downloaded by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers from www.liebertpub.com at 11/20/20.

(4) a public Botanical Garden (Phipps Botanical Gar- dens in Pittsburgh) whose teaching kitchen provi- des information on nutrition basics, culinaryinstruction, and Motivational Interviewing to Uni-versity of Pittsburgh medical students, as well as >1000 adults and 400 children per year (OA3.02); and (5) a program in Alberta, Canada, where a teaching kitchen program has been successfully customized for senior citizens in an effort to enhance healthbehaviors and quality of life (P-1.02). /C15An additional abstract by Massa et al. (OA 4.01) entitled, ''Global Estimates of Cooking Frequency Prior to COVID-19'' summarizes results from a Gallup Poll sur-vey of 152,974 adults across 142 countries around theworld with respect to cooking frequency. Data are based on a novel series of questions (Cooking Frequency Questionnaire) that was embedded within the Gallup PollSurvey in 2019, to assess the frequency of ''cooking from scratch,'' and provides data on cooking frequency vari- ability worldwide, gender disparities in cooking fre-quency, and the relationship between cooking frequency and life evaluation and positive experiences. This re- search provides a novel replicable measure of ''cookingfrom scratch'' and global baseline data regarding cookingfrequencies, by country, pre- COVID-19. Lastly, subject matter experts facilitated eight breakout sessions. These included discussions with respect to teach- ing kitchens as applied to (1) precision nutrition; (2) inter-national collaborations; (3) integrative and lifestyle medicine; (4) educating health professionals; (5) clinical practice and research; (6) agriculture and sustainable foodsystems; (7) inter-professional synergies of registered dietitian-nutritionists, chefs, mind-body, and other teaching kitchen instructors; and (8) challenges and opportunitiesrelating to enhancing health equity. The goal of eachbreakout was to identify (1) topics that are missing from the current list of teaching kitchen research priorities, (2) or- ganizations and thought leaders who are currently missingfrom this multi-disciplinary line of inquiry, and (3) collab- orations that do not yet exist but should be explored and nurtured to advance research involving teaching kitchensworldwide. Our shared circumstances in the year 2020 as related to the COVID-19 pandemic; rising rates of noncommunic-able chronic disease (e.g., obesity and diabetes); global cli- mate change; and systemic racism informed many aspects ofthis scientic meeting. Most agreed that we will not\u2014and cannot\u2014return to ''normal life pre-COVID 19,'' but rather, will need to collectively ''build back better'' in the yearsahead. This conference made a strong case for the inclusion ofteaching kitchens in the development of cocreated future plans and research opportunities intended to encourage a culture of health. Moreover, the involvement of so many individuals andorganizations with teaching kitchens from around the globe suggests that there will be more TKRCs in the years ahead.
