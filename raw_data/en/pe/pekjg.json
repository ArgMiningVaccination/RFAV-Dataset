Yet according to research, moving your body can decrease the pain associated with this condition that affects an estimated one in six Americans. Brent A. Bauer, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program, says many movement practices, such as yoga and tai chi, as well as meditation and guided imagery, benefit those suffering from IBS thanks to the fact that they induce the relaxation response. \"This in turn balances the autonomic nervous system,\" says Bauer, which influences the function of many internal organs, including the digestive system.

The study analyzed gait, which is the manner in which someone walks that includes everything from stride length to speed, even arm swing. They found that changes in those parameters were associated with decline in memory, thinking and language skills. \"The goal will be to identify these individuals that develop these changes through time and potentially do something to prevent the decline if possible,\" explains Rodolfo Savica, M.D. a Mayo Clinic Neurologist and lead author of the study.

To recount just two instances: A 20-year-old nephew, after receiving a very caring letter from his sister-in-law explaining why she could not be his lover, went to his room, shot himself in the head and died ... Now a new study reveals just how lethal suicide attempts, as a risk factor for completed suicide, are. The study, led by Dr. J. Michael Bostwick, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, tracked all first suicide attempts in one county in Minnesota that occurred between January 1986 and December 2007 and recorded all the deaths by suicide for up to 25 years thereafter. Eighty-one of the 1,490 people who attempted suicide, or 5.4 percent, died by suicide, 48 of them in their first attempt. The findings were reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Reach: The New York Times has a daily circulation of nearly 649,000 and a Sunday circulation of 1.18 million. Context: While a prior history of suicide attempt is one of the strongest predictors of completed suicide, a Mayo Clinic study finds it is more lethal than previously known. Researchers find that suicide risk was nearly 60 percent higher than previously reported when based on a population-based cohort focusing on individuals making first lifetime attempts and including those whose first attempts were fatal. This risk was dramatically higher for attempts using firearms. The population sample was identified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project. \"We hoped to address the shortcomings of earlier studies by including two groups previously overlooked by other studies,\" says J. Michael Bostwick, M.D., a psychiatrist on Mayo Clinic's Rochester campus and the lead author of the study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. \"Our study enrolled individuals whose first-ever suicide attempt presented to medical attention. Not only did we include those who survived this initial attempt, but we also included those who died on their first attempt rather than ending up in the emergency room. These are large groups that have been routinely ignored in calculation of risk.\" More information can be found on Mayo Clinic News Network.

Because of its glue-like properties, gluten is often added to other food products\u2014pasta, sauces, crackers, baked goods\u2014to thicken or bind those products together. \"These kinds of junk foods and refined carbohydrates promote weight gain and diabetes and disease,\" says Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine and a gluten researcher at Mayo Clinic. So if you're eating a lot of cookies, crackers and other grain-based snack foods, any diet that limits your intakes of them is bound to do your health some good. \"But for those who don't suffer from celiac disease, gluten isn't inherently bad, and gluten-free foods aren't inherently healthy,\" he says.

The search for a genetic cause of the teenager's death was done with \"good intentions,\" said Michael Ackerman, a cardiologist and director of the Windland Smith Rice Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

This erroneous diagnosis occurred as a result of inappropriate use of genetic testing and incorrect interpretation of genetic test results, according to Mayo Clinic research published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings. This case highlights the potential danger of genetic testing when it is used incorrectly and the great need to not only use this powerful tool carefully and wisely but to scrutinize the results with great caution, says senior author Michael J. Ackerman, M.D., Ph.D., genetic cardiologist and director of Mayo Clinic's Windland Smith Rice Sudden Death Genomics Laboratory. \"While the technological advances in genetic sequencing have been exponential, our ability to interpret the results has not kept pace,\" he says.

Context: Several national surveys have found that approximately 15 to 20 percent of adults in the U.S. will report high levels of stress. A new study by Mayo Clinic researchers identified stress and burnout as a major problem employees face within the medical industry, leading to negative health behaviors. With rising stress levels in the workplace for employees, many companies are looking to integrate, engage and enroll employees into wellness programs. \"It's important to teach individuals to monitor their stress levels over time and practice effective, ongoing stress-reduction strategies, such as getting involved in wellness programs, this will in-turn help health care employees live a happy and health life,\" says Matthew Clark, Ph.D., lead author of the study and resiliency expert at the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program.
