Recent history of COVID - 19? Describe . Describe a ny laboratory testing results Occupation/indication for receiving COVID - 19 vaccine Describe any o ther pertinent exposure history (e.g., recent trauma, surgery, hospitalization, travel , sick contacts) Case Triage A s resources and jurisdiction allow, a utopsy should be considered for deaths occurring after COVID - 19 vaccination . The following are some broad guidelines: o Most anaphylactic events attributable to vaccination occur within minutes to hours : thus, individuals expiring suddenly post - vaccination (i.e. within 24 hours ) should be prioritized for autopsy o Individuals should be prioritized for autopsy if there is no readily obvious and plausible explanation for cause of death OR there are new onset signs/symptoms not fully explained by underlying conditions (i.e. within a year of vaccination ) o Individuals with suspected COVID - 19 should be prioritized for autopsy. For more information, see: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/hcp/guidance - postmortem - specimens.html Autopsy Perform full autopsy (preferably including brain and spinal cord) Pe rform thorough histologic samplin g to evaluate for cause of death ; including collection of lung and upper airway tissues if COVID - 19 is suspected Carefully assess for findings consistent with anaphylaxis, i.e. laryngeal edema, pulmonary hyperinflation, mucus plugging of airways, tissue eosinophilia Carefully examine the vaccine injection site for evidence of inflammation/infection Ancillary Testing In cases of suspected anaphylaxis , consider s erum tryptase , s erum IgE analysis Consider freezing serum or tissue Toxicologic analysis COVID - 19 PCR Routine postmortem microbiologic and other infectious disease testing, as indicated by gross findings and clinical history Request antemortem laboratory specimens, if available Other tests as appropriate for diagnoses under consideratio n Death certification When completing the death certificate, if it is the opinion of the medical certifier that the vaccine caused death, the vaccine and its fatal complications should be reported in the proper sequence in Part 1. **VAERS=Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System If the vaccine is determined to be a signific ant contributing factor, it should be reported in Part 2. If it is determined that the vaccine is not a cause or contributing factor to death, it should not be reported on the death certificate. More information on cause of death certification can be fou nd in the Handbooks for Death Registration (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/handbooks - and - guides.htm). VAERS Reporting ME/C are strongly encouraged to report deaths occurring after COVID - 19 vaccine administration , irrespective of attribution to vaccination, to VAERS ** online at: https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html If assistance with reporting to VAERS is needed, email info@VAERS.org or call 1 - 800 - 822 - 7967 Other Public Health Reporting ME/C should consult with their state or local health department to determine if there are any other jurisdiction - specific public health reporting or investigative preferences or requirements.
