My biggest surprise is how much I always look forward to the next appointment with excitement.\" \u2014 Michael Egan, Old Chatham, NY (Healthgrades review) \" Dr. Cooney cares for our entire family with great skill and attentiveness. His thoughtful anthroposophic philosophy is driven by understanding the lifestyles, values, and dispositions of his patients in order to prescribe specific healthcare solutions, not those that come out of a box. We trust Dr. Cooney with our lives, like most of the other families in the Great Barrington/Stockbridge southern Berkshires area.\" \u2014 Michael Cohen, Great Barrington, MA (Healthgrades review) \" Dr. Cooney is someone I can recommend highly. He's a rare breed of medical doctor \u2014 he takes the time to listen, to sort things through, to come up with the best solutions for me \u2014 as an individual. In a world of \"in and out\" when it comes to doctors, I'm a huge fan. And his sense of calm is healing.\" \u2014 Anonymous, Stockbridge, MA (Healthgrades review) \" Dr. Cooney is one of the most informed doctors I've known. His bedside manner is impeccable.

He is the best!\" \u2014 Anonymous, Great Barrington, MA (Healthgrades review) \" We are very fortunate to have Dr. Cooney serving the Berkshire community. He empowers his patients to be responsible for their own self care and lifestyle choices. With a gentle heart, humor, and humility, he guides his patients to discover with him the best health care plan for them, especially outside of traditional allopathic medicine and drugs. He cares for the whole person, body, soul and spirit. I am grateful that I can receive his intelligent and compassionate care, especially as I age.\" \u2014 Carol McGlinchey, Great Barrington, MA (Healthgrades review) "}
