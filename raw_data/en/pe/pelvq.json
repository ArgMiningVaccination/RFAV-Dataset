After detecting its first case of COVID -19 in March 2020, Maine activated its entire public health infrastructure to quickly identify, investigate, and isolate COVID -19 cases. While responding to the emerg ing virus through testing, personal protective equipment ( PPE) distribution, and contact tracing, Maine also began its planning for the eventual approval of a vaccine (or vaccines) for the prevention of COVID -19. This document is the result of Maine's initial planning efforts. Given the significant number of unknowns around any vaccine(s) that are eventually approved, this document is necessarily one that will evolve as additional information emerges . The State of Maine will update the document as more is learned about manufacturing, storage, efficacy in different groups, dosing schedules, as well as other factors that will affect the implementation of vaccine on a large scale. It will also evolve with additional input from health care providers, communities in Maine, and the public. Version 1, posted on Oct ober 16, 2020, will be updated. In general, Maine will use three principles to guide its approach to COVID -19 vaccination: 1. Equity : COVID- 19 has not affected all groups in Maine equally. Some groups \u2014such as racial and ethnic minorities \u2014have experienced rates of disease that far exceed their representation in the population as a whole. Other groups, such as seniors \u2014especially those who live in congregate care settings \u2014have experienced sign ificant mortality associated with COVID -19. And individuals with serious chronic medical conditions have experienced disproportionate morbidity from COVID -19. As part of its planning, Maine intends to make health equity a central focus of its effort. 2. Access ibility : Maine 's planning effort is focused on making COVID -19 vaccine accessible to all Maine people. Maine has actively engaged with health care providers of all types, in all areas of the state, to make vaccine as easily available as possible. For certain populations, such as front -line health care workers and first responders, Maine is working directly with hospitals to provide the vaccine at those workplaces . For other groups, such as those who live in congregate care settings, Maine is working with health care providers who may be able to go on site and vaccinate residents to reduce the need for travel. 3. Flexibility: Given the number of questions that remai n about the vaccines themselves, their efficacy in different populations, the schedule of doses, cold- chain storage requirements, as well as data, reporting, and monitoring, Maine's COVID -19 plan is flexible by design. As new information and guidance become available, our plan will be updated to reflect the latest available information. We will also maintain that same flexible approach with respect to vaccination prioritization and distribution itself. Maine is committed to a COVID -19 vaccine planning and implementation process that furnishes the vaccine to Maine people in a timely, equitable fashion. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 4 | Page Section 1: COVID -19 Vaccination Preparedness Planning A. Describe you r early COVID -19 vaccination program planning activities , including lessons learned and improvements made from the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign, seasonal influenza campaigns, and other responses to identify gaps in preparedness . In anticipation of a COVID -19 vaccine, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC ) began COVID -19 vaccination planning activities in the s pring of 2020. We began by determining preliminary objectives, key stakeholders, and g aps. Maine CDC then started building a foundation for communicating to stakeholders and for initial response activities such as planning physical dist ancing guidance for promoting childhood vaccines . Initially , the Maine CDC Immunization Program (MIP) worked with partners to identify steps that could be taken to mitigate the impact of vaccine -preventable diseases ( VPD) in the absence of a C OVID -19 vaccine. MIP and its partners focused on promoting routine vaccination s to limit the concurrent spread of VPDs other than COVID -19. MIP also monitored vaccine order s to identify possible gaps in vaccination coverage. MIP collaborated with partners to encourage vaccination and provided guidance on safe vaccination during the pandemic. Specifically, MIP held weekly conference calls , which included pediatricians , family physicians, hospital systems , Tribal l iaison s, the Maine CDC Public Health Nursing program , state and local e mergency m anagement agencies, and community vaccinators . Our focus expanded from initially addressing concerns of vaccinating with confidence during a pandemic to eventually encompassing COVID- 19 vaccine planning efforts. Providers reported s uccess stories of curbside clinics and tele- health well -child visits and follow -up appointment for vaccination , to the promotion of influenza vaccine and now COVID -19 vaccine planning efforts . Utilizing guidance from the U.S. CDC for physical distancing, we updated our School -Located Vaccine Clinic T oolkit and created a Community Vaccination Tool kit. (Appendix A) In the fall , our efforts focus ed on expanding influenza vaccination rates across Maine. MIP's vaccinating campaign for the 2020- 2021 flu season includes a specific emphas is on vaccinating the entire family and people at higher risk for flu and COVID -19 infections. The U.S. CDC routinely provides pediatric influenza vaccine doses to the state through their Vaccines F or Children program. This year they have also allocated the State of Maine an additional 94,000 flu doses to target adult populations. This will create an opportunity for medi cal providers to vaccinate parents and any family member accompanying pediatric patients without the concern of cost to the family. Since MIP has a limited number of adult vaccination providers, MIP is currently recruiting providers who can provide influenza vaccine to adults , especially in Long- Term Care Facilities (LTCF) and other providers that serve high- risk populations. Once these new Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 5 | Page providers are on board, MIP plans to partner with them to furnish COVID -19 vaccination, once such a vaccine is available. Simultaneously, MIP is laying groundwork to connect Maine's electronic immunization information system ( IIS), with the U.S. CDC's IZ Gateway, a national platform that allows the sharing of vaccine administration data between states . This linkage will be vital for COVID- 19 vaccination data collection, sharing, and analysis. The lessons learned from H1N1 vaccination efforts have guided current planning efforts. Specifically, Maine CDC is focused on ensuring that partnerships with health care providers, schools, and other public health entities contribute to the successful campaign and become a valuable resource for future vaccine campai gns. Key partners include hospitals, health centers, school administrators and staff, school nurses, visiting nursing associations, EMS, other health care providers and practices, Maine CDC Public Health Nurses, Maine CDC District Public Health Liaisons , Maine CDC Vaccine Coordinators assigned to each public health district, emergency management agencies (county, state, municipal), municipal health departments, volunteers (including EMS and those who registered with Maine Responds), District Coor dinating Councils for Public Health , Healthcare Coalitions , the community, and other public health entities throughout the state. During mass vaccination efforts around the H1N1 novel influenza virus, it was noted that sometimes vaccine was shipped to a location, such as a hospital pharmacy, where staff had not been involved in vaccine planning and coordination. We have surveyed our hospital systems and have collected point of contact information as we ll as capacity and storage capabilit y information on all such facilities . Also, the after -action review of H1N1 efforts revealed that, w hen H1N1 vaccine was in limited supply, vaccinators felt pressure from those in the larger priority groups who were not immediately prioritized. For example, many health care workers made compelling arguments for being vaccinated early as they were in one of the la rge priority groups. However, health care workers were prioritized primarily to keep them from spreading disease to patients. Therefore, only health care workers exposed to the highest risk patients were initially prioritized. These distinctions were difficult to communicate to the public as well as those delivering vaccine. Individuals expressed concerns about the number of otherwise healthy health care workers and first responders receiving vaccine when they and their family members at high risk for compl ications from H1N1 could not access vaccine. Maine is utilizing information collected in the Hospital System S urvey to determine the number of health care workers who may be prioritized , with the assumption that available vaccine will not be able to meet the demand to vaccinate all individuals . Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 6 | Page B. Include the number/dates of and qualitative i nformation on planned workshops or tabletop, functional, or full -scale exercises that will be held prior to COVID -19 vaccine availability. Explain how continuous quality improvement occur s/will occur during the exercises a nd implementation of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program . The Maine CDC COVID -19 Training and Exercise schedule is as follows: 1. Maine CDC and Maine Emergency Management Agency met virtually on October 6th, 2020 to plan and tentatively schedule a v accination tabletop exercise workshop on November 5th, 2020. 2. Vaccination tabletop exercise December 8th, 2020 Workshop planning group participants will include internal and external stakeholders Tabletop Exercise will include county, local , state and non- governmental partners who are stakeholders in Maine Immunization and Mass Vaccination Program s An after -action discussion will be held immediately following completion of the Tabletop Exercise An After -Action Review will occur within 30 days of the Tabletop Exercise and an improvement plan will be impleme nted accordingly 3. Maine CDC has engaged the services of Texas A&M TEEX who will deliver virtual Mass Prophylaxis Preparedness and Planning training on December 14- 15, 2020 Eighteen of the 30 participant slots have been filled by a broad audience of stakeholders as of the writing of this report 4. Recent training that has been held regarding this subject matter is as follows : October 2nd and 3rd , 2019, Texas A&M TEEX educated a combination of 50 Maine CDC Public Health Nurses and Medical Reserve Corp s Volunteers in Medical Counter Measures Point of Dispensing and Response . In November 2019, the Maine CDC influenza working group held a tabletop exercise on responding to a n influenza pandemic that includes a mass vaccination component . In addition, Maine CDC has recently conducted several large -scale vaccination efforts. One entailed providing vaccinations for several hundred asylum seekers who arrived in Maine during the summer of 2019. In addition, Maine CDC has also organized recent, large- scale hepatitis A vaccine efforts following an increase in cases in adjacent states.

Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 10 | Page B. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble a broader committee of key internal leaders and external partners to assist with im plement ing the program , reaching critical populations, and developing crisis and risk communication messaging. The response effort in Maine will be spearheaded by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( Maine CDC). All programs in the Maine CDC have altered their practices to assist with the COVID -19 response, though MIP, PHN, Dis trict Public Health Liaison s, and PHEP will be the major players in the vaccination plan. This is the internal \"Crisis Team\". Maine CDC will take the lead in policy development , collaborat e with state and local partners , serve as a clearinghouse for educational and technical materials , supply vaccine and vaccination supplies , establish data management standards , and develop technical assistance guidance and provide consultation. M aine CDC staff will be responsible for the following: Vaccine M anagement - Coordination of the delivery of vaccine from the supplier to \"ship- to\" sites within healthcare system and community partners in coordination with the District Liaisons and the Health Care Coalitions . This includes ordering vaccines to be shipped to designated sites within the healthcare system as well as monitoring vaccine accountability and ensuring that national reporting requirements are met. Education - Facilitation of the development of appropriate messaging, training, and associated educational materials for distribution to healthcare and community partners. It includes providing information to the public through mass media, press coverage direct communication and outreach by District Liaisons . Reporting - Reporting will be done utilizing the adverse event monitoring system established for all vaccinations provided in the state , and by c ollect ing information on doses administered in Maine with reporting to the U.S. CDC as prescribed. Planning - Maine CDC will provide a statewide plan for the implementation of mass vaccination efforts. Statewide vaccine coordination - Support ing and coordinating vaccine administration to priority groups outside of the healthcare system , ensuring that they have the vaccine needed to administer to their priority groups. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 11 | Page C. Describe how your jurisdiction will plan for, develop, and assemble an internal COVID -19 Vaccination Program planning and coordination team that includes persons with a wide array of expertise as well as backup representatives to ensure coverage. Once vaccine is available, more detailed planning and implementation will start moving at a rapid pace. To be successful, early engagement with partners and stakeholder is vital. M aine CDC and partners have been working together since early in the pandemic respons e to develop objectives and plans for COVID -19 vaccination response. This work will continue after this initial version of the plan. The Maine CDC crisis planning team consist of the following groups and representative roles/responsibilities : Maine Immunization Program Serves as lead for vaccination response. Coordinate s with District Liaison s to ensure significant reach to populations of special needs and continuing building the relationships in their respected jurisdictions.

Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 14 | Page E. Describe how your jurisdiction will coordinate efforts between state, local , and territorial authorities . Maine enjoys strong communication and linkages with other states, as well as among localities within the s tate. Maine intends to ensure visibility and insight into its planning and rollout through regularly scheduled meetings and briefings wi th those parties. For other states, Maine is an active participant in the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), which convenes regular calls and meetings to discuss the progress of vaccine planning and rollout. For example , ASTHO has recently held meetings focused on strategies to provide vaccine coverage and ensure uptake in rural states, such as Maine. Maine also participates in the Association of Immunization Managers (AIM), which convenes similar meetings. AIM provide s immunization managers a forum to share best practices on tactical implementation of vaccine strategies. Our intention is to continue active participation in both organizations to coordinate our efforts among different state, local, and territorial entities. Maine has also participated in COVID -19 vaccine planning discussions organized by the National Governors Association. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 15 | Page External meetings, communications to organizations F. Describe how your jurisdiction will engage and coordinate efforts with leadership from Tribal communities, Tribal health organizations, and urban Indian organizations. MIP has an ongoing relationship with the five fede rally recognized T ribes in Maine. In addition to the routine VFC program site visits, the MIP Senior Health Program Manager and the embedded federal Public Health Advisor meet with leadership and staff from the Tribal health centers at least once a year to discuss issues and identify ways that MIP can better support Tribal communities. In addition to continuing routine interactions, Maine will engage with all five Tribal governments to discuss COVID- 19 vaccine planning. The planning team that will work with the five Tribal governments in Maine will include Maine DHHS Clinical Advisor Lisa Letourneau , M.D.; the Tribal Public Health District Liaison ; and the federal Public Health Advisor , who has spent more than 10 years working with Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal programs . Tribal governments will be given the option to obtain a COVID -19 vaccine supply through the Indian Health Service or through the state of Maine . At this time, Tribal entities in Maine have not yet had to make this decision. However, regardless of the decision made by T ribes, the state of Maine is committed to assisting them with all aspects of COVID -19 vaccine planning and administration. MIP will assist T ribal organizations with communications, technical assistance, and questions they may have regarding the vaccine regardless of whether Tribes receive vaccine from the s tate of Maine or IHS.

Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 19 | Page Section 3: Phased Approach to COVID- 19 Vaccination A. Describe how your jurisdiction will structure the COVID -19 Vaccination Program around the three phases of vaccine administration: Phase 1: Potentially Limited D oses A vailable U.S. CDC anticipates P hase 1 to begin as early as November 2020 and to last approximately six weeks. Maine intends to largely follow the priorit y group detailed by the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Science ( see Appendix E) . Maine CDC will need to identify subgroups to vaccinate in the first phase if vaccine supply is limited . As noted in Appendix E, Phase 1 will thus be divided into two sub- phases: 1(a) and 1(b). Phase 1(a) will likely be healthcare workers providing direct pa tient care in high risk settings and others who work in critical infrastructure as well as those working and living in long- term care facilities. Vaccination of these target groups will occur in closed , point -of-dispensing (POD) settings with the health c are systems throughout Maine. Even though vaccine supply will likely be limited, vaccine will be ship ped in relatively large quantities in relation to storage capacity of many of our current vaccinators. One of the presentations will ship in 100 dose increments and needs to be stored at - 20 degrees Celsius and the other will be shipped in 1,000 dose increme nts and will need to be stored - 70 degrees Celsius . Maine CDC will work with the health care systems and pre-identify facilities with the capabilit y to safely store the vaccine to serve as receiving and redistribution points for the vaccine. If vaccine needs to be redistributed District Liaisons will assist H ealth Care Coalitions to coordinate vaccine transfer to vaccination sites or to P ublic Health Nursing and the Emergency Medical S ervices for Strike Team use. (Vaccine transfers will be document ed in the Maine Immunization Information System in the same manner that routine vaccination transfers are documented) . Vaccinators should plan to administer vaccine within a few days of receipt to ensure the vaccine viability. Vaccination settings in Phase 1 will likely include closed PODs in the healthcare settings for highest priority healthcare workers, closed PODs and/ or strike teams at long term care facilities and closed PODs / strike teams for highest priority critical infrastructure. Phase 2: Large N umber of Doses A vailable, S upply L ikely to M eet D emand Phase 2 will begin in when vaccine supply is sufficient to vaccinate more broadly and with the expectation to reach surge capacity efforts. M aine CDC will continue to vaccinate by priority group and begin using mass vaccination strategies such as open PODs in community settings, s chool l ocated vaccination c linics , and possibl y curbside clinic s. District Liaisons , Health Care Coalitions and a Maine Immunization Program Public Health Educator will have Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 20 | Page an increased role in P hase T wo. All will work together to coordinate mass vaccination efforts , including communication to the public and logistics of the clinics. Additional vaccine distribution sites including Federally Qualified Health Centers, and Private and Public Providers will start to receive vaccine in anticipation of assist ing with vaccination efforts. Phase 3: Likely Suff icient Supply , Slowing Demand Phase 3 is expected to start once groups in Phase 1 and Phase 2 have had the opportunity to be vaccinated. At this point, COVID -19 vaccination efforts will transition to routine vaccination and will be conducted through traditional means. By this time , pharmacies will likely be able to vaccinate against COVID -19. Th is is especially helpful in reaching individuals that live in rural setting with limited access to tradition al healthcare facilities. Mass vaccination efforts will continue in P hase 3 if they are still needed. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 21 | Page Section 4: Critical Populations A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to: 1) identify, 2) estimate numbers of, and 3) locate (e.g., via mapping) critical populations. Critical population groups may include: COVID- 19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID -19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19: Asthma ( moderate -to-severe) Cerebrovascular Disease ( affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain) Cystic F ibrosis Hypertension ( or high blood pressure) Immunocompromised State (weakened immune syst em from blood or bone marrow transplant ) Immune Deficiencies HIV Use of Corticosteroids (or use of other immune weakening medicines) Neurologic Conditions Such as Dementia Liver Disease Pregnancy Pulmonary Fibrosis ( having damaged or scarred lung tissues ) Smoking Thalassemia ( a type of blood disorder ) Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID -19: Cancer Chronic kidney disease COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher ) Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies Sickle cell disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 22 | Page To assist with determining critical population s, Maine reviewed multiple data sets to determine approximate numbers and identify critical populations. D ata collected and evaluated originated from the following resources: Data and Dashboards Team, Vaccine Planning Unit , U.S. CDC . o Example of data sets include but is not limited to hospital data, nursing and residential care facility employees , law enforcement, fire and rescue, postal service, correctional facilities, grocery store employees, homeless shelter population, and high- risk individuals Priority 1 Assessment Hospital Survey distributed by the Maine Immunization Program (see Appendix D) Annual Surveys facilitated by the Maine Immunization Program o HealthCare Worker Survey o Post-Secondary Survey Information obtained on nursing home and long- term care facilities from the Maine Division of Licensing and Regulator y Services Census data Through GIS m apping with the Department of Transportation and the location of pharmacy locations throughout Maine , it was determined that 99% of the population live within a 30 -minute drive to a pharmacy . This information will help will assist with access to vaccination and decrease the burden on the healthcare systems. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 23 | Page B. Describe how your jurisdiction will define and estimate numbers of persons in the critical infrastructure workforce, which will vary by jurisdiction. Data collected in the Health System COVID Planning Survey distributed to hospital systems throughout Maine at the beginning of September will help determine the number of individuals within the healthcare systems that should be prioritized when there is a limited amount of vaccine available to su pport the critical medical infra structure. The Maine CDC asked for information from the hospital s to help with ongoing COVID -19 vaccine planning. The survey was designed to obtain information on the following: Hospital -level COVID -19 vaccine planning/ logistics /OIT/ pharmacy l eads Hospital e mployee numbers Vaccine s torage capacity Vaccine a dministration Clinics IT data colle ction capacity. Preliminary results demonstrated that 53% of hospital personnel should be prioritized for vaccine in Phase 1a.

Describe how your jurisdiction will determine additional subset groups of critical populations if there is insufficient vaccine supply . Maine will be seeking guidance from specific, topical working groups fo r recommendations for narrowing the subset groups of the critical population if there is insufficient vaccine supply. D. Describe how your jurisdiction will establish points of contact (POCs) and communication methods for organization s, employer s, or communi ties (as appropriate) within the critical population groups. Initial points of contacts will be collected through the Maine professional associations . Hospital occupational health sys tems throughout Maine will allow us to target the assumed Phase 1 priority groups for the first available vaccine allocations. Continuing to build the relationships that the District Liaisons have created since the H1N1 Pandemic in each Public Health District will ensure that communities are prepared to vaccinate priority groups a s additional vaccine is available. Reaching out to the large em ployers that were partners during H1N1 will further broade n vaccination site s to reach larger groups of individuals and famil y members . We will continue to utilize the contacts established through the Maine Immunization Program with the Tribal commun ities. Partnerships developed by the District Liaisons will assist in reaching diverse populations and communities. Public Health Nursing networks will augment the partnerships developed by the District Lia isons. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 26 | Page Section 5: COVID -19 Provider Recruitment and Enrollment A. Describe how your jurisdiction is currently recruiting or will recruit and enroll COVID -19 vaccination providers and the types of settings to be utilized in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program for each of the previously described phases of vaccine availability, including the process to verify that providers are credentialed with active, valid licen ses to possess and administer vaccine. Hospitals : Maine has a total of 37 hospitals operating within one of three large healthcar e system s; several independent critical access hospitals ; and three psychiatric inpatient facilities. Several of these facilities are currently enrolled in the VFC program. The Maine Immunization Program is actively engag ed with all the se hospital facilities , holding weekly COVID- 19 Phase 1 Vaccine Planning conference call s during which we make available the most recent U.S. CDC updates , including a review of the COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement and enrollment requirement s. We anticipate enrolling all 37 Maine hospitals as COVID- 19 Vaccine Provide r sites as a priority for Phase 1. Long- term care facilities : Utilizing the adult influenza supplemental funding, the Maine Immunization Program sent communications to all licensed long -term care facilities in the state to actively recruit and enroll them in the Maine Immunization Program, and offer supplemental influenza vaccine to these non -traditional congregate living facilities , and several have already enrolled, or begun the proce ss of enrolling. These sites will be encouraged to enroll to be a COVID -19 Vaccine Provider site as well. Long- term care facilities that do not have the capacity for storage and handling of vaccines, or those who have very few employees or residents , have been noted as candidates for \"strike teams\". These strike teams will be comprised of Maine Public Health Nursing staff and Maine EMS staff to provide on- site vaccination services. Long -term care facilities will be prioritized for Phase 1 vaccination efforts. Pharmacies : The Maine Immunization Program is actively engaged with the Maine Pharmacy Association to discuss enrolling all Maine pharmacies as COVID -19 Vaccine Provider sites. These pharmac y sites will be used as a mechanism to reach long -term care facilities unable to meet the COVID -19 enrollment requirements during Phase 1 and the general public for subsequent phases. V erifying the licensure of pharmacists who participate in vaccination efforts will be done via the Maine Board of Pharmacy. Indian Health Service: Maine has fi ve Tribal health centers in the state , and a ll five locations are enrolled in the VFC program. A ll five locations are represented under one public health district. The District Liaison and a representative from each location are included in our weekly COVID -19 Vaccine Phase One planning calls and are receiving Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 27 | Page enrollment information as it is available. MIP anticipates enrolling these sites under Phase 1 if they do not receive vaccine under direct allocation from the U.S. CDC. Mobile vaccination providers : The Maine Immunization Program currently has several providers enrolled in the VFC program to conduct annual influenza clinics for Maine school age children in the elementary school setting s and large -scale community settings. MIP is actively engaged in enrolling these providers as COVID -19 Vaccine Provider sites to utilize their efforts during the general public phases of COVID -19 vaccine distribution. Occupation al health setting for large employers : The Maine Immunization Program has reviewed the H1N1 provider list to obtain historical information for large employers in the state that offered influenza clinics for their employees. MIP will also collaborate with the Maine Department of Labor to obtain a list of the largest employer s in the state. Through communications and outreach, we plan to engage this group of sites for enrollment during Phases 2 -4, prioritizing based on the high- risk nature of employment. Federally qualified health centers , rural health centers, p hysicians' offices , etc. : Most FQHCs and physicians' offices that provide pediatric care in the state of Maine are enrolled as VFC providers in the Maine Immunization Program. We will ensure this group of traditional primary health care settings are informed of the COVID -19 Vaccine Provider enrollment requirements and will begin enrolling these sites during Phase 2. Urgent Care Clinics : Given that urgent care clinics have been accessible to the public throughout the pandemic, the Maine Immunization Program envisions enrolling them as COVID- 19 Vaccine Providers. Other locations : The Maine Immunization Program will ensure that all locations not addressed above be given the ability to enroll as COVID- 19 Vaccine Provider s if they meet the requirements of the provider agreement. These other settings include colleges, correctional faci lities, homeless shelters, dialysis centers, etc. These locations will be prioritized based on the high- risk populations that they serve. Maine Immunization Program staff will review a ll COVID- 19 Vaccine Provider Agreements to ensure that each site meets the requirements of enrollment prior to receiving vaccine. This will include a review of signatures, storage and handling capabilities, and potential vaccine administration need. Staff will check each provider listed under the prescribing provider section against the appropriate State of Maine licensing board roster to ensure that they hold an active Maine license and can legally prescribe vaccine in the s tate of Maine. COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreements will not be approved unless all sections are complete and after a review of medical licenses is done. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 28 | Page B. Describe how your jurisdiction will determine the provider types and settings t hat will administer the first available COVID -19 vaccine doses to the critical population groups listed in Section 4. The Maine Immunization Program will prioritize enrollment of hospitals and long- term care facilities and pharmacies throughout the state to ensure that Maine healthcare personnel and long- term care residents in Phase 1 receive COVID -19 vaccine when available. A survey was sent to hospitals to ascertain their total healthcare personnel numbers and their high- risk employee population. In the event that vaccine is allocated in small doses and not all healthcare employees can be vaccinated with the first round of vaccine shipments, we asked that the hospital employee high- risk population be broken down into emergency department staff, ICU staff, and required any other high- risk staff to be listed by department. The Maine COVID -19 Vaccine Planning Committee will make the determination of which departments to prioritize based on federal vacci ne allotments. All other enrollments will be prioritized by the anticipated population phases they may be serving. C. Describe how provider enrollment data will be collected and compiled to be reported electronically to U.S. CDC twice weekly, using a U.S. CDC -provided Comma Separated Values (CSV) or JavaScript (JSON) template via a SAMS- authenticated mechanism. The Maine Immunization Program will require each COVID -19 vaccine site to complete a fillable PDF form of the COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement , both sections A and B. When enrollment forms are received, they will be entered into Microsoft Power App. Maine CDC wi ll provide the U.S. CDC twice -weekly CSV files on the number of provider sites enrolled, and any other provider agreement data reporting elements required. D. Describe the process your jurisdiction will use to verify that providers are credentialed with active, valid licenses to possess and administer vaccine. For each COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement received, Maine Immunization Program staff will check each provider listed under the prescribing provider section against the appropriate State of Maine licensing board to ensure that they hold an active Maine license and can legally prescribe vaccine in the s tate of Maine. CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreements will not be approved until a review of medical licenses is done. E. Describe how your jurisdiction will provide and track training for enrolled providers and list training topics. For enrolled VFC providers, the Maine Immunization Program requires that the primary and secondary vaccine coordinators receive training on all program requirements, storage and handling best practices, and our Immunization Information System, IIS . Maine CDC plans to mirror this Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 29 | Page process for COVID -19 Vaccine Providers. Through the use of a U.S. CDC -provided training program, such as \" You Call the Shots \", or a n internally developed training program , we will require that each site vaccine coordinator has received training prior to vaccine being distributed to the site. The Maine Immunization Program will be utilizing the Microsoft Power App as our primary mechanism for tracking the COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreements and that required training has been completed . F. Describe how your jurisdiction will approve planned redistribution of COVID -19 vaccine (e.g., health systems or commercial partners with depots, smaller vaccination providers needing less than the minimum or der requirement). Maine is requiring that e very COVID -19 Vaccine Provider complete both sections A and B of the Agreement , including those sites with a health system or parent organization. Additionally, we will enroll every COVID -19 vaccine provider site into our IIS . Any redistribution from organization to site, or from site to site, will follow our current VFC protocols for vaccine transfer. Both primary and secondary locations are required to be active sites , have current acceptable vaccine storage temperatures recorded in IIS within the past 24 hours , and have reconciled their vacci ne inventory within the past two weeks . All transfers will be completed electronically using the IIS. This not only ensures that cold chain is maintained, but that we can have administration data at the site location, versus the organization level. G. Describe how your jurisdiction will ensure there is equitable access to COVID -19 vaccination services throughout all areas within your jurisdiction. Maine CDC has established a group of external stakeholders who meet on a regular basis to plan for an event ual COVID -19 vaccine. Soon, there may also be specific working groups comprising additional stakeholders. These could include Dr. Shah in his capacity as state health official ; representation from local chapters of the A merican A cademy of Pediatrics , American A cademy of Family P ractitioners , American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ; and other healthcare officials throughout the state. Working groups will review recommendations from the A dvisory Committee of I mmunization P ractices and U.S. CDC regarding target populations for vaccine distribution and advise MIP on vaccine distribution, ensuring allocation and access is equitable. H. Describe how your j urisdiction plans to recruit and enroll pharmacies not served directly by the U.S. CDC and their role in your COVID -19 Vaccination Program plans. MIP is working with the Maine Pharmacy Association to enroll all Maine pharmacies as COVID- 19 Vaccine Provider sites. These pharmacy sites will be used as a mechanism to reach long -term care facilities unable to meet the COVID -19 enrollment requirements during Phase 1 and the general public for subsequent phases. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 30 | Page Section 6: COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Capacity A. Describe how your jurisdiction has or will estimate vaccine administration capacity based on hypothetical planning scenarios provided previously. B. Describe how your jurisdiction will use this information to inform provider recruitment plans. As well as conferring with professional organizations to determine their members ' vaccination capacity, MIP will also utilize the 2017 Modeling Pandemic Influenzas Vaccination for Adults, Maine Report. This estimate considers traditional administration avenues such as medical providers, workplace health programs , school -located vaccination clinics and public health sites. It also looks a t pharmacies and mobile Point of Dispensing sites. According to this report, Maine has the capacity to administer an estimated 129,000 doses per week (96,750 adult vaccine administrations and 32,250 pediatric vaccine administrations) when vaccine is being produced at 30 million doses weekly. According to this same report, Maine will be able vaccinate 80% of Maine residents within approximately 12 weeks, provided there is enough vaccine. By utilizing the information gathered from discussions with professional organizations and the data f rom this report, MIP will be able to identify missed opportunities for provider enrollment and better target recruitment efforts. MIP can also use this in formation in case of an outbreak and there is a need to enroll providers in specific areas. Potential Vaccine Providers in the Stat e of Maine Provider Type Estimated # Participating Weekly Capacity in Doses Minimum Maximum Typical Hospitals 32 25,600 38,400 32,000 Doctor Office and Clinics 137 43,840 65,760 54,800 State Health Departments 1 600 800 680 City Health Department 2 1,200 1,600 1,360 Open POD's 47 15,040 22,560 18,800 53,110 Supermarket 204,262 Modeling Capacity for Adults , Maine Report , September 2017 Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 31 | Page Section 7: COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation, Ordering, Distribution, and Inventory Management A. Describe your jurisdiction' s plans for allocating/assigning allotments of vaccine throughout the jurisdiction using information f rom Sections 4, 5, and 6. Include allocation methods for populations of focus in early and limited supply scenarios as well as the variables used to determine allocation. The IIS and staff can designate providers as eligible to order COVID -19 vaccine via the Pandemic Allocation functionality based on the identified priorities. The allocation tool allows for MIP staff to accept, deny or modify orders individually or at program level dependent on overall vaccine allocation amounts supplied from the U.S. CDC. Providers are also required to update their vaccine need within the IIS which delineates the age cohorts and insurance status of the populations the organization serves to assist in assigning vaccine allocations. Maine will utilize the Tiberius Platforms to assist in vaccine planning, distribution and allocation efforts. This will allow us to plan provider -level orders across a range of distribution scenarios. Tiberius provides flexible and data -backed applications that enable users to make data -driven decisions. B. Describe your jurisdiction's plan for assessing the cold chain capability of individual providers and how you will incorporate the results of these assessment s into your plans for allocating/assigning allotments of COVID -19 vaccine and approving order s. Providers will be required to create appropriate cold storage units (refrigerators, freezers, ultra-cold) within the IIS. The creation of the units will populate the appropriate temperatures per unit and will require daily temperature recordings. B efore an organization can place an order , the IIS will require that they have the appropriate units for which vaccine is being ordered , in-range and up- to-date temperatures. MIP staff will review orders for approval by assessing the provider vaccine need and current inventory on hand. C. Describe your jurisdiction's procedures for ordering COVID -19 vaccine, including entering/updating provider information in VTrckS and any other jurisdictional systems (e.g., IIS) used for provider ordering. Describe how you will incorporate the allocation process described in step A in provider order approval . Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 32 | Page Providers mus t enroll in the Maine Immunization Program in order to receive vaccine. If a provider wishes to receive vaccine but are not enrolled, the provider must follow the following steps to enroll in the program. To enroll: Complete and return the following forms to MIP: Provider Agreement Form for COVID -19 MIP Provider Agreement IIS Administrator User Agreement. Send pictures of the vaccine storage units to MIP enrollment staff ; participate in a virtual enrollment visit and trainings with MIP staff. MIP will review all enrollment components to ensure all required components are complete and will notify provider if any additional information is needed or notify the provider that their enrollm ent is complete , and provider can order vaccine. If provider is already enrolled in MIP, provider will only need to complete the Provider Agreement for COVID19. To order vaccine, designated ship- to-sites should use the defined process for ordering: Upda te cold chain by entering storage unit temperatures into IIS. Ensure all doses administered have been entered into IIS . All COVID -19 doses should be documented in the IIS no later than one business day after administration. Reconcile inventory to ensure accurate dose count. Determine the number of additional doses needed. Create order via IIS. MIP will review and approve or deny orders to ensure vaccine is distributed to the highest need areas and /or equitably across the state. MIP staff will review current inventory on hand to prevent over -ordering and appropriate allocations from the pandemic allocation tool . MIP will upload order(s) from the IIS to VTrcks (ExIS) for order fulfillment. D. Describe how your jurisdiction will coordinate any unplanned repositioning (i.e., transfer) of vaccine. Vaccinators that are not ship- to sites, community vaccinators, and/or strike teams may obtain vaccine from designated ship- to sites via the pre -existing vaccine transfer process within the IIS. To receive COVID -19 or any other vaccines supplied by MIP; The organization must be an enrolled COVID -19 provider. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 33 | Page Both enrolled sites (the transferring vaccine and the site accepting the vaccine transfer) must have up- to-date temperatures in the IIS. Ensure the vaccine is packaged using proper cold chain manage ment for the physical transfer of the vaccine Include a packing list of the vaccine(s) being transported and lot information Both organizations must complete the transfer process within the IIS E. Describe jurisdictional plans for monitoring COVID -19 vaccine wastage and inventory levels . The IIS Vaccine management staff verify orders based on vaccine need and current inventory on hand at the time of the order to reduce over -ordering. MIP requires reconciliation of inventory every 14 days (highly recommended weekly) , prior to placing an order, by performing physical counts of inventory on hand to ensure the physical inventory matches the IIS inventory. The IIS inventory will display inventory based on orders received and doses administered. Every dose of vaccine that is unaccounted for must be notated with a reason for wastage i.e. broken vial, spoiled, drawn up but not administered etc. The MIP can review reconciliation status and determine wastage percentages on an ongoing bas is. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 34 | Page Section 8: COVID -19 Vaccine Storage and Handling A. Describe how your jurisdiction plans to ensure adherence to COVID -19 vaccine storage and handling requirements , including cold and ultracold chain requirements, at all levels : Individual provider locations (IIS cold chain reporting) Satellite, temporary, or off -site settings (IIS cold chain reporting) Planned redistribution from depots to individual locations and from larger to smaller locations (IIS cold chain reporting) Unplanned r epositioning among provider locations All COVID -19 Vaccination Program Agreements will be reviewed for the following: Signatures from both the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Execut ive Officer agreeing to comply with agreement requirements - #7 requires organizations to comply with U.S. CDC requirements for COVID -19 vaccine management Review of vaccine storage capacity for refrigerated, frozen, and/or ultra- frozen vaccine Signature attesting that vaccine storage units listed will maintain appropriate temperatures as indicated in the agreement In addition to the agreement review and approval, all COVID -19 vaccination program sites will be required to enroll in the Maine IIS, IIS, and comple te a COVID -19 Vaccine Educational Training. This training must be completed by the primary COVID -19 Vaccine Coordinator prior to receiving COVID -19 vaccine. This COVID -19 Vaccine Education Training will either be in a manner provided by the U.S. CDC, such as \" You Call the Shots \", or developed by the Maine Immunization Program. This tra ining will cover the following requirements, at a minimum: COVID- 19 Vaccine Provider Agreement Requirements Vaccine Store and Handling temperature requirements for refri gerated, frozen, and ultra-frozen vaccines Protocols for maintaining cold chain at the individual provider location Protocols for transferring vaccines as outlined in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit Protocols for Vaccine Clinics as outlined in the revised Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off -Site Locations as well as Vaccination Guidance During a Pandemic. Maine IIS, IIS , Training - including documentation of storage unit temperatur es and transfer protocols This review of required signatures and training at each COVID -19 Vaccination site will ensure that each location understands cold chain requirements at all levels of vaccine Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 35 | Page distribution. The Maine Immunization Program will take the following steps to ensu re these cold chain requirements are met at every level : Individual provider locations - current Maine VFC providers are required to record temperature min imum/max imum daily and enter these temperatur es at least once a month into the Maine IIS, with a strong recommendation that temperatures be entered weekly. The Maine Immunization Program will ensure adherence to this temperature reporting requirement by monitoring site activity compliance. Any site out of compliance with temperature recording will be conta cted immediately. Satellite, temporary, or off -site setting - any providers conducting off site clinics must record these under the Mass Vaccination Module in IIS . Additionally, providers must comply with recommended storage and handling procedures outlined by the U.S. CDC. Maine CDC will conduct routine spot checks for those providers indicating they have held a clinic to ensure sites are maintaining required clinic temperature recording documentation and that temperatures are remaining within stability ranges. Planned redistribution from depots to individual provider locations - Maine is requiring that all COVID -19 Vaccination sites com plete both A and B sections of the COVID- 19 Vaccine Provider Agreement. All sites will be ordering and/or transferring vaccine under the ordering and transfer protocols outlined for VFC providers. Prior to a physical vaccine transfer taking place, both sites must have document ed up-to-date cold chain within 24 hours and complete a transfer in IIS . Protocols ensure that cold chain is recorded during the transfer and records remain with receiving site for a minimum of three years. Unplanned repositioning among provider locations - protocols for transferring COVID- 19 will be covered during the COVID -19 Vaccine Education Training which includes the documentation of transfers in IIS. However, if such transfers take place as they sometimes occur with our VFC providers, they are caught a s soon as the provider site tries to record administration of a vaccine that was transferred as that lot number and vaccine would not be available in their inventory. Provider sites would then have to follow the transfer protocol by completing an electronic transfer in IIS and recording all cold chain within 24 hours of the transfer. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 36 | Page B. Describe how your jurisdiction will assess provider/redistribution depot COVID -19 vaccine storage and temperature monitoring capabilities. By signing the COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement the site is agreeing to continuously monitor vaccine temperatures. The Maine Immunization Program will ensure that the COVID- 19 Vaccine Education Training includes a review of acceptable vaccine storage and handling temperature monitoring devices and digital data loggers. In addition, any site that is ordering ultra -cold vaccine will be contacted directly by the Maine Immunization Program to ensure that their digital data logger can record temperatures between -60 and -80 degrees in the event that vaccine is stored in an ultra -cold unit and out of the vaccine packaging in which it was shipped. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 37 | Page Section 9: COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Documentation and Reporting A. Describe the system your jurisdiction will use to collect COVID -19 vaccine doses administered data from providers. The IIS will be utilized for vaccine doses administered by providers. Providers will have multiple ways to report including r eal-time HL7 interface directly from their EMR following the U.S. CDC's HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation guide for Immunization Mes saging Release 1.5 , direct entry into the IIS , Mass Vaccination quick entry, or CSV/flat file upload per IIS specifications .

Describe planned backup solutions for offline use if internet connectivity is lost or not possible. The IIS s current disaster recovery plan provides a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 24 hours and recovery time objective (RTO) of 96 hours . The IISs data is backed up Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 44 | Page daily , weekly and monthly which include s the OS, application and database directories to ensure the most recent data is captured and archived . In the event the IIS is not immediately available vaccine orders and cold storage monitoring will need to be submitted via a paper process. The MIP will submit orders on behalf of providers and will provide shipping distribution information. Vaccine usage can be submitted in either a CSV or Flat format (Per IIS specifications ) when the IIS is available to document immunization administrations for patients and to reconcile vaccine inventory. G. Describe how your jurisdiction will monitor data quality and the steps to be taken to ensure data are available, complete, timely, valid, accurate, consistent, and unique . Ad hoc quality assurance reports for data quality and timeliness. Dose Decrementing Error mitigation - The fix tool is used to correct immunization records sent via Data Exchange that failed to decrement from an organization's inventory due to an error in the HL7 immunization message. MIP highly encourages error mitigation to be done daily to ensure accurate administration information. Patient deduplication and merging - Manual Merges are situations where the IIS prepares a list of potential duplicate patients based on criteria other than what the system normally uses for auto- merging/scoring in its patient de -duplication process. Patient merging will be performed daily to ensure valid and complete records . IIS Monthly System Statistics and Performance report s IIS System Statistics Current Month (September) Total number of immunizations 12,927,156 New immunizations added 1,611,846 New clients/patients added last month 10,454 Total number of data exchange jobs 111,641 Percent of data exchange versus UI transactions 72% Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 45 | Page Section 12: COVID- 19 Vaccination Program Communication A. Describe your j urisdiction's COVID -19 vaccination communication plan, including key audiences , communication channels , and partner activation for each of the three phases of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program . Maine CDC is planning to engage an individual to lead the proactive communication efforts. This individual will build upon current communications to promote vaccine safety and dispel vaccine misinformation. Messaging will be tailored to reach key audiences including healthcare personnel, health insurance issuers and plans, employers, government and community partners and stakeholders, and public consumer and essential workers. B. Describe your jurisdiction's expedi ted procedures for risk/crisis/emergency communication, including timely message development as well as delivery m ethods as new information becomes available . The Maine Immunization Program will develop a COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution web page for our website . This will ensure constituents have all required and suggested res ources in one location. This page will include the following: Fillable PDF of COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agreement COVID- 19 Vaccine Distribution FAQs Contact email links EUA Fact Sheets or VISs COVID- 19 Vaccine Educational Training Module (developed by MIP) All COVID -19 Vaccine communications (listserv) documents Link to the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit Revised Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off-Site L ocations Vaccination Guidance During a Pandemic Maine CDC will also make frequent use of the statewide Health Alert Ne twork system (HAN) to notify providers, health care systems, and other stakeholders of important information on a real -time basis . The HAN system has been in use and, during the H1N1 vaccination efforts, was a valuable tool to apprise the public health community of important information. The bulletins, which can include clinical, public health, and other information, are publicly available on the Maine CDC website, as well: https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/newhan.shtml Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 46 | Page Maine CDC also intends to engage closely with community health workers (CHW) as part of our educational outreach efforts. We intend to provide information to CHWs on vaccines both from a safety/efficacy perspective as well as an access perspectiv e. The goal is to equip CHWs with all the information they need to be effective communicators within their communities. Given that many CHWs are able to communicate in the native language of many Maine people, the information provided to them will be avai lable in multiple languages to facilitate that communication. We intend to offer specific briefings for CHWs to empower them to work with their communities, many of whom are immigrant and other non- majority groups. Using risk communication strategies along with the U.S. CDC's developed Vaccinate with Confidence framework we will develop a messaging campaign for Maine people. Th e vaccination communication campaign will be developed with the following objectives: Educate the public about the development, authorization, distribution, and execution of COVID -19 vaccines and evolving information . Ensure public confidence in the approval or authorization process, safety, and efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines. Help the public to understand key differe nces in FDA emergency use authorization and FDA approval (i.e., licensure). Engage in dialogue with internal and external partners to understand their key considerations and needs related to COVID -19 vaccine program implementation. Ensure active, timely, accessible, and effective public health and safety messaging along with outreach to key state/local partners and the public about COVID -19 vaccines. Provide guidance to local health departments, clinicians, and other hosts of COVID - 19 vaccination provide r locations. Track and monitor public receptiveness to COVID -19 vaccination messaging. Broad Communication Planning Phases Messaging should be timely and applicable for the current phase of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Before vaccine is available: Vaccine is available in limited supply for certain populations of early focus (Phase 1) Vaccine supply is increasing and available for other critical populations and the general public (Phase 2) Vaccine is widely available (Phase 3) Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 47 | Page Communication Activities : Communicate early about the safety of vaccines in general and have easily accessible, government information to address myths, questions, and concerns. Keep the public, public health partne rs, and healthcare providers well -informed about COVID- 19 vaccine(s) development, recommendations, and public health's efforts. Engage and use a wide range of partners, collaborations, and communication and news media channels to achieve communication goa ls, understanding that channel preferences and credible sources vary among audiences and people at higher risk for severe illness and critical populations, and channels vary in their capacity to achieve different communication objectives. Communicate proa ctively whenever possible, anticipating issues and forecasting possible problems before they reach broad awareness. Ensure that communications meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Plain Language Act, and other applicable disability rights laws for accessibility. Use information and education campaigns to extend reach and increase visibility of vaccine recommendations and resources. Work closely with partn er agencies, representatives of local communities with critical populations, and intermediaries to achieve consensus on actions, consistency in messages, and coordinated communication activities. Communicate transparently about COVID -19 vaccine risks and recommendations, immunization recommendations, public health recommendations, and prevention measures. Messaging Considerations Public health messages and products should be tailored for each audience and developed with consideration for health equity. It is important to use plain language that is easily understood. Information should be presented in culturally responsive language and available in languages that represent the communities. Jurisdictions should be careful to address all people inclusively, with respect, using non- stigmatizing, bias -free language. Insufficient consideration of culture in developing materials may uninte ntionally result in misinformation, errors, confusion, or loss of credibility. In addition, Maine CDC District Public Health Liaisons are able to use existing relationships with immigrant and other non- majority populations to promote linguistically and c ulturally appropriate messaging. The District Liaisons can work with those communities to ensure such information is provided in an effort to promote the highest possible vaccine uptake. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 48 | Page Based on the feedback they receive, they can also tailor messages to specific groups within their districts to ensure that messaging is accurate and responsive to pressing questions. These considerations and any others that emerge during message development and deployment should be reviewed again when material is translate d. Communication Channels Jurisdictions and Tribal organizations should explore how specific groups are most likely to access information with the communication methods available to them. Feedback mechanisms such as a web page or e -mail account to allow the audience to express concerns, ask questions, and request assistance are extremely important, and creating such mechanisms should be a priority for jurisdictions. Promotion of public service announcements will be distributed by using and existing contract with the Maine Association of Broadcasters will be utilized for channels to broadcast with Radio and TV. Digital m edia will be displayed through the internet and social media. Written communication channels will be facilitated through Go vDelivery and other direct chan nels. We have al so created an email box specific to receiv e communication s: C19Vaccine.MECDC@maine.gov. Maine will regularly review available U.S. CDC COVID- 19 Communication Resources. Maine will utilize the U.S. CDC -developed COVID -19 One -Stop Shop Toolkits for communication, including toolkits tailored for different populations as well as a social media toolkit. To reach essential workers for vacci nation, Maine will assist industry and businesses in communicating with employees about vaccination clinics. Maine will utilize the U.S. CDC's COVID- 19 Communications Plan for Select Non- Healthcare Critical Infrastructure Employers to guide the communications .

Describe your jurisdiction's methods and procedures for monitoring r esources , including: Budget Maine CDC will monitor funding that has been issued for COVID -19 response efforts. Monitoring will include appropriate use of categorical funding to ensure that the intensions of the awarded funding meetings the criteria for the expenditure. Staffing Monitoring workflow and resources within the Maine Immunization Program will be key for vaccine ordering and distribution. We are in the process of bringing on four contractors to assist in support for the IIS, Vaccine Management and Enrolling Providers. MIP has a request fo r quotes is being advertised to hire a Communications Staff. MIP has requested an individual to assist with the use of Tiberius., and we are adding funds to an additional contract to hire an individual to assist with working with phar macies and to assist with program documentation. Daily morning calls are occurring within MIP to keep a pulse on planning, workflow and addressing any high priority concerns. PHN will work closely with ME Responds/MRC , EMS , and Schools of Nursing to supplem ent staffing needed to respond. Supplies Regular monitoring and replenishment of supplies for clinics will ensure availability as needed. Monitoring the use of PPE throughout the response will proactively ensure that Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 52 | Page supplies, PPE and other items needing r eplenishment will ensure that scheduled clinics will be supplied. The Office Associates within the Public Health Nursing Division follow an operations protocol to ensur e that supplies and PPE are monitor and replenish ed. C. Describe your jurisdiction's methods and procedures for monitoring c ommunication, including: Message delivery Reception of communication messages and materials among target audiences throughout jurisdiction Maine CDC takes steps to ensure that proactive health promotional communications are received by the intended groups and are also effective at informing those groups and/or correcting misconceptions. Maine CDC uses a variety of approaches: Engage stakeholders prior to issuing communications to ensure that their feedback is reflected. Encourage feedback from constituents after messaging has been issued. Reviewing metrics such as the number of downloads, clicks, and viewers for messages placed in mass media. At a later date, looking at health outcomes to determine whether the message had the intended e ffect on health behavior. D. Describe your jurisdiction's methods and procedures for monitoring l ocal-level situational awareness (i.e., strategies, activities, progress , etc.) . Monitoring Doses Administered and Inventory on hand will help determine the uptake of the vaccine and assist in analyzing what percentage of the population within each Public Health District has received a single dose or a completed series of the vaccine. PHN will reconcile after each clinic the number of doses given, as well as the single dose or completed series , with the inventory. We will be requesting from COVID -19 Vaccine Providers a list of open clinics and will be posting them on our website for the general public to has visibility on where they can receive a COVID -19 vaccinati on. We will be surveying the Hospitals after the first Phase 1a vaccine has been distributed and assess uptake and lessons learned to discuss quality improvement process to put into place for when additional vaccine is available. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 53 | Page E. Describe the COVID -19 Vaccination Program metrics (e.g., vaccination provider enrollment , doses distributed, doses administered, vaccination coverage), if any, that will be posted on your jurisdiction's public -facing website, including the exact web location of placement. We are in the process of developing a web site that will include: o Analytical Dashboard from information obtained in the IIS - Number of Doses Ordered - Number of Doses Administered - Number of Providers Enrolled with a COVID -19 Provider Agreement - Other information is being considered o A Provider Resource Area - Provider Agreement - EUA guidance - Educational Module - Vaccine Safety and Monitoring - Storage and Handling Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 54 | Page Appendix A: Racial/Ethnic Minority COVID-19 Vaccination Plan Maine's approach to ensuring timely access to COVID -19 vaccine for members of r acial/ethnic minority groups will evolve following consultations with members and leaders of those groups. This document and plan will be updated as those discussions and consultations occur. What is presented here is a strategic overview of how the State of Maine intends to engage with representatives from at -risk groups to ensure their needs are met from an education, outreach, access, and equity perspective. ECOVID -19 rates for racial and ethnic persons in Maine are disproportionately high. Even though this population account s for roughly 5% of the population (see table below), this group accounts for 25% of COVID- 19 cases in Maine. Maine is placing special emphasis on ensuring all Mainers, especially those from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds , have accurate information on COVID -19 vaccine and can access that vaccine, once available. Members of the Maine COVID -19 planning team have consulted with T ribal leaders, the Maine Migrant Health Program , and the District Liaisons and we acknowledge that more needs to be done to reach these populations. Maine will work strategically with partners to meet the needs of ethnic minorities. Our approach will be to consult regularly with representatives of racial /ethnic minority communities to understand their needs, first and foremost, and build systems responsive to those needs in partnership with such groups. Much of this consultation and planning will occur via a working group specifically designed to address , understand, and plan for the needs of these populations across Maine. Maine Covid -19 Vaccination Plan 55 | Page There are a variety of considerations this working group will discuss. In advance of the arrival of a COVID- 19 vaccine, the group can help design, draft, and distribute educational mat erials on the importance and safety of vaccination generally, as well as the benefits of establishing a relationship with a health care provider. As a vaccine is slated for arrival in Maine, this working group can help understand and plan for the optimum way to encourage uptake of the vaccine at the community level. Specifically, the working group can address issues related to access to the vaccine, taking into account factors like transportation, geography, open hours of service . The working group can a lso provide guidance to Maine CDC on culturally appropriate means of communication around vaccine safety and efficacy. Collaborations with partners that are already engaged with these populations will help reach these groups in an effective manner (e.g., the Department of Health and Human Services' Health Equity Improvement Initiative) . Maine will work with these partners to developed culturally appropriate messaging and outreach methods to serve these populations. Maine DHHS has been hosting mont hly webinars for the provider community to address racial and ethnic disparities related to COVID -19 and will focus its November webinar on strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy in communities of color. As well as working with current partners, the response team will the Public Health District Liaisons to identify other organizations that already providing outreach to racial and ethnic minorities. Potential partners include , but not be limited to : Community Organizations led by and/or that serve minority populations Local offices of Minority Health and other public health organizations employing CHWs Other states: utilize resource developed by other states for racial and ethnic populations Churches and Religious organizations with racial and ethnic membership Tribal leaders and Health Centers Translation service providers The working group will ensure minority groups are able access and seek out COVID -19 outreach services. It will monitor COVID -19 response activities to underserved populations such as ethnic and racial minorities, people experiencing homelessness, LBGTQ +, or other groups identif ied as potentially vulnerable. Tactically, t he working group will utilize IIS data as well as applications such as Tiberius to monitor COVID -19 vaccination efforts and uptake . The working group will use these data to develop or modify their plan of action for outreach to special populations. The working group will also coordinate with Strike Teams and local healthcare facilities to connect minority groups with vaccination services .
