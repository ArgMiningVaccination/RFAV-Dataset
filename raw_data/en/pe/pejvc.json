My Story Health Education and Health Promotion Two terms which are sometimes used interchangeably. Health education is about providing health information and knowledge to individuals and communities and providing skills to enable individuals to adopt healthy behaviors voluntarily. It is a combination of learning experiences designed to help individuals and communities improve their health, by increasing their knowledge or influencing their attitudes, whereas Health promotion takes a more comprehensive approach to promoting health by involving various players and focusing on multisectoral approaches. Health promotion has a much broader perspective and it is tuned to respond to developments which have a direct or indirect bearing on health such as inequities, changes in the patterns of consumption, environments, cultural beliefs, etc.( 3) WHO. South East Asia Regional Office. Regional Strategy for Health Promotion for South East Asia. 2008. [Last accessed on 201 1 Apr 10]. Available from: http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Reports_and_Publications_HE_194.pdf .Health Promotion: An Effective Tool for Global Health Health, as the World Health Organization (WHO) defines, is the state of complete physical, social and mental well being and n ot just the absence of disease or infirmity. The enjoyment of highest attainable standard of health is considered as one of the fundamental rights of every human being . (5) Over the past few decades, there is an increasing recognition that biomedical interventions alone cannot guarantee better health . Health is heavily influenced by factors outside the domain of the health sector, especially social, economic and political forces. These forces largely shape the circumstances in which people grow, live, work and age as well as the systems put in place to deal with health needs ultimately leading to inequities in health between and within countries.(6) Thus, the attainment of the highest possible standard of health depends on a comprehensive, holistic approach which goes beyond the traditional curative care, involving communities, health providers and other stakeholders. This holisti c approach should empower individuals and communities to take actions for their own health, foster leadership for public health , promote intersectoral action to build healthy public policies and create sustainable health systems in the society. These elements capture the essence of \"health promotion\", which is about enabling people to take control over their health and its determina nts, and thereby improve their health. It includes interventions at the personal, organizational, social and political levels to facilitate ad aptations (lifestyle, environmental, etc.) conducive to improving or protecting health .(1,2 ) 1.

Sanjiv Kumar and GS PreethaIn addressing lifestyle -related chronic disease, apathy and overcoming resistance with adopting active lifestyles requires skill sets and new approaches for setting in motion new habits. Building self-confidence knowledge and helping participants transcend engrained self -defeating habits, requires meeting people where they are at, thus, this requires creating programs and engaging participants that lead to sustained well -being.Despite the limited success of available interventions in reversing the current trends in obesity prevalence, approaches focusing on individual behavior change remain an important topic of interest in obesity research. Several reasons justify this assertion. First , these interventions typically focus on behaviors (for example, diet and physical activity), which have widespread consequences for health, with or without weight loss. Second , if and when individuals are able to successfully self -regulate their behaviors, these effects tend to be sustainable, which is essential for having a lasting impact on health; moreover, this successful self -regulation may also \"transfer \" to, and help change, other health behaviors (Mata, et al., 2009). Third , although some interventions targeting individuals may be ineffective on their own, they might be able to contribute to the effectiveness of strategies that integrate multiple levels (that is, strategies that include individual -level and environmental -level approaches) (Lakerveld , et al., 2012) The focus on patient engagement stems from a belief that the actions of health professionals constitute only part of the effort necessary to help people cope with the effects of illness or disability and restore them to the best possible state of health. An equally, if not more, important part is played by patients themselves, their families, and communities as coproducers of health. Patient Engagement and Patient Activation \"Patient Engagement\" refers to actions individuals must take in order to benefit from the healthcare system ( Gruman , et al., 2010). \"Patient activation\" has been defined as the cultivation of knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage one's own health (Hibbard, 2004). Low patient engagement and activation stem from a wide range of internal and external barriers, including low awareness of risk, limited perspectives on possible improvements, distrust of providers, values conflicts, competing commitments, social pressures, and/or environmental obstacles at home or work. Physicians and other clinicians typically lack the necessary time and expertise to explore issues related to behavior change with patients (WHO, 2008). As a result, the need for a mechanism for successful, sustained patient engagement and activation \u2014a crucial component of chronic disease prevention \u2014is not met in the current system (Mezzich , 2011).Setting the Stage... \"Health and Wellness coaches will help catalyze a transformation in healthcare.
