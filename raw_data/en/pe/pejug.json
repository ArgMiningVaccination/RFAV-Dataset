PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and nutrient status? What is the answer to the question? Moderate evidence indicates that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk may be associated with fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. However, the difference in fatty acid status between infants fed human milk and infant s fed infant formula is likely to depend on the composition of the human milk and infant formula consumed. Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and iron and zinc status from birth to 24 months. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and iodine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D status from birth to 24 months. Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and iron, zinc, vitamin D, and fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and iodine or vitamin B12 status from birth to 24 months. Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and fatty acid status. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin B12, or vitamin D status from b irth to 24 months. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants and iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, or fatty acid status from birth to 24 months . Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. How was this question answered? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Birth to 24 M onths Subcommittee , conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. 10 What is the population of interest? The population of interest was generally health infants and toddlers ( birth to 24 months). What evidence was found? This review includes 23 articles. The review examined available evidence about : o Infants who ever consumed milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) compared with infants who never consumed human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) for different durations, o Infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before infant formula was added to their di ets, and o Mixed -fed infants (i.e., consuming both human milk and infant formula, but not complementary foods and beverages) who consumed different amounts of human milk. These articles examined available evidence related to iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin D, v itamin B12, and fatty acid status. Most evidence compared fatty acid status between infants who ever and never consumed human milk. Infants who ever consume human milk and infants who never consume human milk (i.e., formula -fed infants) may have differences in fatty acid status. The difference in fatty acid status probably depends on infant formula ingredients and human milk composition. There are limitations in t he evidence as follows: o There was not a lot of evidence about i nfants who c onsumed human milk for different durations, infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before infant formula was added to their diets , iron status , zinc status , and vitamin D status . There was no evidence about m ixed-fed infants who consumed different amounts of human milk, iodine status, and vitamin B12 status. o Most studies were designed to examine the effect of new infant formula ingredients and not the systematic review question. o Some of the infant formulas used in the studies may be different from infant formulas currently sold in the United States. o It is possible for factors other than infant feeding to impact the outcomes, and these factors were addressed differently by different studies. How up -to-date is this systematic review? This review searched for studies from January, 1980 to September, 2019. 11 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Birth to 24 M onths Subcommittee , conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and nutrient status? Conclusion statement s and grades Ever vs never consuming human milk o Moderate evidence indicates that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk may be associated with fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. However , the difference in fatty acid status between infants fed human milk and infants fed infant formula is likely to depend on the composition of the human milk and infant formula consumed. (Grade: Moderate) o Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and iron and zinc status from birth to 24 months. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and iodine, vitamin B12, and vitamin D status from birth to 24 months. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Duration of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk o Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumpti on, among infants fed human milk, and iron, zinc, vitamin D, and fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and iodine or vitamin B12 status from birth to 24 months. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula o Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and fatty acid status. No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin B12, or vitamin D status from birth to 24 months. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants o No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants and iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, or fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. (Grade: Grade not assignable) 12 Methods Two literature searches were conducted to identify articles published from January 1980 to March 2016, and from March 2016 to September 2019, respectively . The searches us ed 4 databases ( PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL ) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and the outcomes of iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and fatty acid status. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by 2 NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre- determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee q ualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of conclusion statement s, and graded the strength of evidence using pre- established criteria for r isk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Summary of the e vidence This systematic review examines the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consum ption and nutrient status. Specifically, this systematic review examines available evidence that compares: o Infants who ever consumed milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) with infants who never consumed human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) for different durations, o Infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before the introduction of infant formula, and o Mixed -fed infants (i.e., consuming both human milk and infant formula, but not complementary foods and beverages) who consumed different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk. Human milk refers to mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration or freezing. Examinations of donor milk are not included in this review. Exclusive human milk consumption refers to consuming human milk alone and not in combination with infant formula or complementary foods and beverages. Infant formula refers to commercially prepared infant formul a meeting the FDA and/or Codex Alimentarius international food standards. Complementary foods and beverages are foods and beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. The outcomes of interest we re iron status (including iron deficiency and anemia), zinc status, iodine status, vitamin B12 status, vitamin D status, and fatty acid status. This review identified 23 articles. o Iron status : Ten articles, published between 1990 and 2019, examined the relationships of (a) ever, compared with never, consuming human milk, and (b) different durations of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, with iron status from birth to 24 months. (a) The evidence available from 2 studies did not show a consistent association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and anemia. The evidence available from 5 studies did not show consistent associations between ever, compared with 13 never, consum ing human milk and hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, serum ferritin, or serum iron. (b) The evidence available from 3 studies did not show a consistent association between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and iron deficiency or anemia. The evidence available from 4 studies did not show consistent associations between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin receptor, or transferrin saturation. o Zinc status : Five articles, published between 1986 and 1994, examined the relationships of (a) ever, compared with never, consuming human mi lk, and (b) different durations of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, with zinc status from birth to 24 months. (a) The evidence available from 4 studies did not show a consistent association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and zinc status. (b) The evidence available from 2 studies was insufficient to determine whether there is an association between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and zinc status. o Vitamin D status : One articl e, published in 2014, examined the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and vitamin D status from birth to 24 months. This evidence was insufficient to determine whether there is an association betw een the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and vitamin D status. o Fatty acid status : Nine articles, published between 1986 and 2016, examined the relationships of (a) ever, compared with never, consuming human milk, (b) di fferent durations of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and (c) different durations of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula with fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. (a) The evidence available from 7 studies was moderately consistent in showing that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is related to fatty acid status, but the direction and strength of associations can vary depending on the composition of the infant formula fed to part icipants who never consumed human milk (and also likely due to the composition of human milk, although this could not be assessed), as well as the specific types of fatty acids examined in the blood. (b) The evidence available from 1 study wa s insufficient to determine whether an association exists between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and fatty acid status. (c) The evidence available from 1 study was insufficient to determine whether an association exists between the dur ation of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and fatty acid status. o No studies met the inclusion criteria that examined iodine status or vitamin B12 status. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limit ed by: o The small number of studies that presented evidence on each topic, o The study designs, as most studies were designed to examine the effect of novel infant formula compositions rather than differences in outcomes between infants ever and never 14 fed human milk, o Concerns about the generalizability of the evidence to U.S. infants consuming infant formulas currently on the market, and o Concerns about the potential for bias, especially bias due to confounding. 15 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and nutrient status?

(Grade: Grade not assignable) Summar y of the e vidence This systematic review examines the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and nutrient status. Specifically, this systematic review examines available evidence that compares: o Infants who ever consumed milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) with infants who never 16 consumed human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) for different durations, o Infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before the introduction of infant formula, and o Mixed -fed infants (i.e., consum ing both human milk and infant formula, but not complementary foods and beverages) who consumed different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk. Human milk refers to mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration or freezing. Examinations of donor milk are not included in this review. Exclusive human milk consumption refers to consuming human milk alone and not in combination with infant formula or complementary foods and beverages. Infant formula refers to commercially prepared infant formula meeting the FDA and/or Codex Alimentarius international food standards. Complementary foods and beverages are foods and beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young chil d to provide nutrients and energy. The outcomes of interest we re iron status (including iron deficiency and anemia), zinc status, iodine status, vitamin B12 status, vitamin D status, and fatty acid status. This review identified 23 articles . 1-23 o Iron status : Ten articles, published between 1990 and 2019, examined the relationships of (a) ever, compared with never, consuming human milk, and (b) different durations of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, with iron status from birth to 24 months . (c) The evidence available from 2 studies did not show a consistent association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and anemia. The evidence available from 5 studies did not show consistent associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, serum ferritin, or serum iron. (d) The evidence available from 3 studies did not show a consistent association between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and iron deficiency or anemia. The evidence available from 4 studies did not show consistent associations between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin receptor, or transferrin saturation. o Zinc status : Five articles, published between 1986 and 1994, examined the relationships of (a) ever, compared with never , consuming human milk, and (b) different durations of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, with zinc status from birth to 24 months. (c) The evidence available from 4 studies did not show a consistent association between ever, compared wi th never, consuming human milk and zinc status. (d) The evidence available from 2 studies wa s insufficient to determine whether there is an association between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and zinc status. o Vitamin D status : One article, published in 2014, examined the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and vitamin D 17 status from birth to 24 months. This evidence was insufficient to determine whether there is an association between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and vitamin D status. o Fatty acid status : Nine articles, published between 1986 and 2016, examined the relationships of (a) ever, compared with never, consuming human milk, (b) different durations of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and (c) different durations of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula with fatty acid status from birth to 24 months. (a) The evidence available from 7 studies was moderately consistent in showing that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is related to fatty acid status , but the direction and strength of associations can vary depending on the composition of the infant formula fed to participants who never consumed human milk (and also likely due to the composition of human milk, although this could not be assessed) , as well as the specific types of fatty acids examined in the blood. (b) The evidence available from 1 study w as insufficient to determine whether an association exists between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and fatty acid status. (c) The evidence available from 1 study was insufficient to determine whether an association exists between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and fatty acid status. o No studies met the inclusion criteria that examined iodine status or vitamin B12 status. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limited by : o The small number of studies that presented evidence on each topic, o The study designs, as most studies were designed to examine the effect of novel infant formula compositions rather than differences in outcomes between infants ev er and never fed human milk, o Concerns about the generalizability of the evidence to U.S. infants consuming infant formulas currently on the market, and o Concerns about the potential for bias , especially bias due to confounding. Iron status Ten articles, published between 1990 and 2019, examine d the relationships of ever compared with never consuming human milk , and different durations of any human milk consumption, with iron status from birth to 24 months .1-3,7-9,12,16,20,23 No evidence was identified that met the inclusion criteria to examine different durations of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula or different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants. Description of the evidence comparing ever with never consuming human milk (Table 1 ) Six articles present ed evidence comparing the iron status of infants who ever consumed human milk with that of infants who never consumed human milk .1-3,9,12,23 18 Population The samples of infants were from the United States , China, Germany, and Japan. Five studies followed participants starting at or close to their birth1,2,9,12,23 and one followed participants starting at 12 months .3 Participants in the study by Cusick et al3 were from low -income U.S. families with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Participants from a second U.S. -based study were mostly W hite.2 Authors of the remaining 4 studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their samples. Interventions/exposures and comparators Infants who consumed human milk: Four studies included a group of infants fed human milk exclusively .1,9,12,23 Wu et al23 and Jochum et al9 specified that infants were only fed human milk throughout the observation period (i.e., 8 weeks and 4 months, respectively). The other studies did not specify the duration of the exclusive human milk -feeding period. Three studies included a group of infants fed human milk, but not exclusively. Amano and Murakami 1 included a group desc ribed as partially breastfed, and Cusick et al3 included a group described as ever breastfed. Bradley et al2 identified 3 groups of human milk -fed infants. One group was f ed human milk 6 months with up to 1 supplemental feeding per day of a low -iron formula. The other 2 groups consumed human milk for 1 to 8 weeks and were then randomized to consume formulas with different levels of iron. Infants who never consumed human mi lk: In 3 studies, parents who decided to formula- feed selected the formula.1,3,9 Jochum et al9 stated that families with no history of atopic disease chose 1 of 11 different cow milk formulas, whereas st udy staff recommended partially hydrolyzed whey protein formula to parents of children with a family history of atopy . Authors of the other 2 studies did not specify the formulas parents selected. In 3 studies , parents who decided to formula- feed were ass igned to a formula by research staff.2,12,23 Wu et al23 assigned a standard infant formula w ith iron, whereas Bradley et al2 and L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen12 randomly allocated infant s to formulas with different levels of iron and different levels and sources of protein, respectively . In addition to human milk and infant formula, some infants consumed complementary foods and beverages and/or iron supplements prior to the measurement of iron status. In the study by Bradley et al,2 infants could consume complementary foods and beverages , including iron- fortified cereals, starting at 4 months (i.e., prior to the outcome measures at 6 and 12 months). Mineral supplements were not prescribed to any of the infants. In the study by Amano and Murakami ,1 infants could consume complementary foods and beverages prior to the outcome measures at 6- 7 and 9- 10 months. In addition, infants determined to have anemia at the 6- 7 month time point were treated and omitted from the 9-10 month analyses. L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen12 and Cusick et al3 did not report whether infants received complementary foods and beverages prior to the measurement of outcome s. L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen12 did not specify which outcome age they reported (i.e., 2, 4, 8, or 12 weeks ), however Cusick et al3 measured outcomes at 12 and 24 months so it is likely that participants were consuming complementary foods and beverages . L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen,12 Wu et al,23 and Cusic k et al3 did not report whether infants received 19 iron supplements prior to measurement of the outcomes, nor did they provide information about whether therapeutic iron was taken by infants with low iron status at earlier time points preceding iron status measurements at later time points. Outcomes Two studies examined anemia. Amano and Murakami1 reported anemia at 9- 10 months, defined as hemoglobin <11.0 g/dL, among infants who did not have anemia at 6- 7 months. Cusick et al3 reported incident anemia at 24 months, defined as anemia at 24 months among children who did not have anemia at 12 months, and persistent anemia at 24 months, defined as anemia at 24 months among children who also had anemia at 12 months. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin <11.0 g/dL adjusted for altitude. Five studies1,2,9,12,23 examined i ron indicators , includi ng hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count , mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, serum ferritin, and serum iron measured between the ages 4 weeks to 12 months. Synthesis and assessment 1Fii of the evidence comparing ever with never consuming human milk (Table 1 ) The evidence examining the association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and iron status is inconclusive. In the synthesis and assessment of the evidence that follows, se veral limitations are described that make it difficult to draw a conclusion. Consistency: The evidence has limited consistency. Anemia : The evidence available from 2 studies did not show a consistent association between never, compared with ever, consuming human milk and anemia. The studies reported statistically significant findings in opposite directions and with different magnitudes of effect. o Amano and Murakami1 found that formula- fed infants had significantly lower odds of anemia at 9- 10 months than infants fed human milk exclusi vely for Cusick et al3 found that infants who never consumed human milk had significantly higher odds of incident anemia and persistent anemia at 24 months than infants who ever consumed human milk [OR 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.06) and O R 1.07 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.11), respectively] . o This inconsistency may be due to key differences between these studies. Cusick et al 3 studied more than half a million (N=583,149) racially and ethnically diverse low -income 12- to 24- month- old infants in the United States . Amano and Murakami1 studied a much smaller group of infants in Japan (N<286; the number of infants included in the analysis of interest was not reported) from birth to 9- 10 months. Cusick et al3 compared infants who never consumed human milk with infants who ever consumed human milk. The authors did not define ever , but presumably , some of the infants in this group were also fed with infant formula. Amano and Murakami ,1 ii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 20 on the other hand, compared infants whose parents chose to formula feed from birth with infants whose parents chose to feed human milk exclusively for an unreported period of time. Amano and Murakami 1 assessed anemia at 9- 10 months and restricted the analysis to infants who did not have anemia at 6- 7 months. Cusick et al3 assessed incident anemia at 24 months (i.e., anemia at 24 months among children who did not have anemia at 12 months) as well as persistent anemia at 24 months (i.e., anemia at 24 months among children who also had anemia at 12 months). It is unlikely that all cases of persistent anemia were captured, however, because infants with a follow - up earlier than 24 months were excluded from the study , and infants with anemia at 12 months were more likely to have a follow -up earlier than 24 months than infants without anemia at 12 months. Amano and Murakami 1 controlled for s ex, delivery method, gestational age, birthweight, weight gain f rom birth to 9 -10 months , \"daily food intake\" (undefined) , phototherapy for jaundice, and maternal anemia, while Cusick et al3 controlled for sex, race, birthweight, and height - and weight -for-age percentile categories at 12 months . Other iron st atus outcomes : The evidence available from 5 studies did not show a consistent association between never, compared with ever, consuming human milk and other iron status outcomes. o Amano and Murakami1 found that infants who consumed human milk exclusively for an unreported duration of time tended to have lower mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume, and higher red cell distribution width at 6- 7 months and at 9- 10 months (among infants who did not have anemia at 6- 7 months) than infants who consumed formula. However, this study did not find similar associations when the exposure variable was partial (rather t han exclusive) human milk consumption. o The remaining 4 studies reported nonsignificant associations for almost all analyses examining comparisons of ever with never consuming human milk and indicators of iron status from 4 weeks to 12 months . 1,2,9,12,23 o Limitatio ns of the body of evidence make it difficult to interpret these findings. The nonsignificant findings may be the result of underpowered analyses; none of the studies reported statistical power for the analyses of interest, and some group sizes were small. In addition, L\u00f6 nnerdal and Chen 12 did not report infants' age at the time of the outcome measure, and Wu et al23 did not report the name/units of the iron indicator measured. Precision: The evidence has limited precision. The body of evidence may have a limited number of sufficiently powered studies. o The studies that examined anemia were sufficiently powered; however , the reported findings lacked precision because they were inconsistent in the direction and magnitude of the associations. o As previously described, there is not enough information to determine whether the studies that examined other iron status outcomes had sufficient statistical power to examine the relationships of interest. In addition, there were only 5 studies. Directness: The evidence has moderate directness. Four of the 6 articles reported study objectives that included the comparison of iron status 21 between human milk -fed and formula- fed infants . 1-3,23 Generalizability: The evidence has limited generalizability. Anemia was examined at 9- 10 and 12- 24 months, and not throughout the birth to 24 month period. The studies that examined anemia only included infants from Japan1 and low - income infants from the United States .3 The results from the Japanese study may lack generalizability to the U.S. population for a couple of reasons. First, the study authors state that, in Japan, infants are typically fed homemade baby food, whereas many American infants are fed iron- fortified complementary foods. Second, the average birthweight i n the Japanese sample was about 3 kg, which is equivalent to only about the 25 th percentile on the World Health Organization growth curves used in the United States . 2Fiii In the study by Cusick et al,3 the persistent anemia findings may not be representative of infants with persistent anemia (i. e., anemia at 12 and 24 months) because i nfants with a follow- up prior to 24 months were excluded, yet infants with anemia at 12 months were more likely than infants without anemia at 12 months to have a follow -up earlier than 24 months. Other iron status outcomes were examined from 4 weeks to 12 months. Infants in the study by Bradley et al 2 were mostly W hite, and the remaining studies did not report race or ethnicity. Risk of bias: There is a limited likelihood that the design and conduct of the studies have prevented or minimized bias. None of the studies accounted for all of the key confounders listed on the analytic framework. Notably, the accounting for complementary feeding, which could have provided a meaningful contribution towards some participants' iron status , was poor. Amano and Murakami1 controlled for \"daily food intake\" but did not adequately describe the variable, and 3 studies did not account for complementary feeding at all .2,3,12 In addition, no studies accounted for any of the other factors to be considered from the analytic framework, and the timing of cord clamping, in particular, may have an important confounding effect on anemia outcomes . 3Fiv The studies were prone to other risks of bias ( Tables 2 and 3) , which varied between studies. iii WHO Growth Standards Are Recommended for Use in the U.S. for Infants and Children 0 to 2 Years of Age. cdc.gov. https://www.cdc.gov/ growthcharts/who_charts.htm#The%20WHO%20Growth%20Charts .

Three studies followed participants starting at or close to their birth ,2,7,20 1 study enrolled participants by 30 days of age,16 and 1 followed participants starting at about 4 months .8 Participants in the U.S. study were mostly W hite,2 participants in the multinational study were all W hite,16 participants in the study from Iceland had Icelandic parents ,20 and participants in the study from Israel were Arab and about 61% were from low -income families .8 Isomura et al7 did not report demographic information. Interventions/exposures and comparators Three studies examined the number of months infants consumed human milk as a continuous variable.7,16,20 Two studies grouped infants into categori es by duration of human milk consumption. Jaber8 compared infants who consumed human milk for <3, 5 -6, and >6 months (note: the article did not include a duration of 3-5 months) . Bradley et al2 compared infants who consumed human milk 6 months with infants who initially consumed human milk (range 1- 8 weeks) and then, after mothers decided to stop feeding human milk, were randomized into 2 groups fed infant formulas with different levels of iron. In addition to human milk, some infants consumed infant formula, complementary foods and beverages, and/or iron supplements prior to the measurement of iron status. Bradley et al 2 specified that infants could consume up to 1 supplemental feeding per day of a low -iron formula. Isomura et al7 estimated that, at 1 month, half of infants were partially breastfed and 8% of infants consumed <5% of their total milk as human milk, and by the time of the 6- month outcome measure, half of infants were partially breastfed and 35% of infants consumed <5% of their total milk as human milk. Male et al 16 reported that, by the 12-month outcome measure, infants had been partially breastfed for an average of 3.6 months (r ange 0- 12 months) and that iron content of formulas ranged from 5 -14 mg/L. In the study by Thorsdottir et al ,20 about 10% and 25% of infants were fed some formula by 1 and 6 months of age, respectively. Jaber8 did not report data about infant formula consumption. Infants in the analyses reported by Bradley et al2 could consume complementary foods and beverages, including iron- fortified cereals, starting at 4 months (i.e., prior to the outcome measures at 6 and 12 months). Isomura et al7 noted that all infants consumed complementary foods by 6 months, when outcomes were measured. Jaber8 reported that at 12 months, when outcomes were measured, about 68% of infants were consuming a varied diet. In addition, 1 infant had consumed tea for a short time during the first month of life, and 2 infants had cons umed cow milk for short periods (not quantified). Male et al 16 stated that all infants were fed complementary foods by the outcome measure, at 12 months, all commercially prepared cereals were iron f ortified, and in the 3- month period preceding the outcome measures 91% of infants consumed meat almost every day. Participants also consumed complementary beverages ; cow milk was introduced at an 32 average age of 10 months (range 1- 12 months) and, at 12 mont hs, about half of infants consumed follow -on formula. Thorsdottir et al 20 noted that the national recommendation at the tim e of the study was to wean to cow milk starting at 6 months of age. Accordingly, 40% of 6-month- olds consumed cow milk, and by the time of the outcome measure at 12 months , 98% of infants consumed cow milk. Intake of complementary foods was not quantified. Bradley et al2 reported that m ineral supplements were not prescribed to any infants , and Isomura et al7 noted that Japan did not have a policy recommendation for infants to take iron supplements at the time of the study. On the other hand, Male et al16 reported that 11% of infants took iron supplements in the 3- month period before the outcome measure (i.e., 9- 12 months) and Jaber8 reported that the proportion of infants taking iron supplement s rose from 12 -13% under age 6 months t o nearly 75% over age 6 months. Thorsdottir et al20 did not quantify infant intake of iron supplements. Outcomes Three studies examined iron deficiency or anemia. Jaber8 defined anemia at 12 months as hemoglobin <11 g/dL. Thorsdottir et al20 defined iron deficiency at g/l Male et al16 defined iron deficiency at 12 months as the presence of 2 of the following abnormal iron status indicators: low mean corpuscular . Iron deficiency anemia at 12 months was defined as anemia (hemoglobin <11.0 g/dL) plus 2 of the abnormal iron status indicators listed above. Four studies2,7,16,20 examined i ron indicators , including hemoglobin, hem atocrit, mean corpuscular iron, transferrin receptor, and transferrin saturation measured at ages 6 and/or 12 months . Synthesis and assessment 4Fv of the evidence comparing different durations of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk (Table 4) The evidence examining the association between the duration of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk and iron status is inconclusive. In the synthesis and assessment of the evidence that follows, several limitations are described that make it difficult to draw a conclusion. Consistency: The evidence has limited consistency. Iron deficiency and anemia: The evidence available from 3 studies did not show a consistent association between the duration of any human milk consumption and iron deficiency or anemia. o Jaber8 and Thorsdottir et al20 both reported statistically significant associations between longer durations of human milk consumption and favorable outcomes. Jaber8 found that significantly more infants who consumed human milk for <3 months or for 5- 6 months had anemia at 12 months than infants who consumed human milk for >6 months (note: the article did not include a duration of 3- 5 months). Thorsdottir et al, 20 likewise, found v A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https: //nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 33 that the duration of human milk feeding was significantly shorter among 12- month- old infants with iron deficiency (i.e., serum ferritin <12 g/l and mean corpuscular volume <74 fL) than among those without. o Male et al 16 reported no significant associations between the duration of full or partial breastfeeding between 0- 12 months and iron deficiency, anemia, or iron deficiency anemia at 12 months. The analyses were likely to have suffi cient statistical power because they examined duration as a continuous variable among the entire sample of 488 infants. o This inconsistency may be due to some important differences between the studies. Participants in the study by Male et al 16 were all W hite, but were from several different European countries . Participants in the study by Thorsdottir et al20 all had Icelandic parents . Participants in the study by Jaber8 were all Arab and predominantly (61%) from low-income families . The samples may have differed in their human milk consumption, although differences in reporting make it difficult to compare across studies . Participants in the study by Male et al16 were partially breastfed for a mean of 3.6 \u00b1 3.9 months. Thorsdottir et al20 reported that 77% of infants were breastfed at 6 months and about 12% were breastfed at 12 months. In the analysis by Jaber8, most infants consumed human milk for >6 months (N=168, compared with N=29 and N=87 for durations of <3 and 5- 6 months, respectively). The sample studied by Thorsdottir et al20 may have consumed more cow milk and less infant formula than the sample studied b y Male et al.16 Thorsdottir et al20 reported that about 25% and 0% of infants consumed infant formula at 6 and 12 months, respectively, but that 40% and 98% of infants consumed cow's milk. Male et al16 reported that formula (with a range of 5- 14 mg/L iron) was consumed for a mean of 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 months and that cow milk was introduced at a mean of 10.0 \u00b1 2.6 months. Jaber8 did not report formula consumption but did report that only 2 infants consumed cow milk ( for short periods ). Fewer infants in the study by Male et al16 were given iron supplements than in the study by Jaber8 (11% and nearly 75%, respectively). It is harder to determine whether the samples differe d in complementary feeding practices . Male et al16 reported that 91% of infants consumed meat almost daily and Jaber8 reported that about 68% of infants were consum ing a varied diet by the time of the outcome measure. Thorsdottir et al20 did not report similar information. Male et al16 accounted for more of the key confounders listed on the analytic framework than Jaber8 and Thorsdottir et al .20 Jaber8 did not adjust for any confounders, Thorsdottir et al20 and Male et al16 both adjusted for sex and types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages, and Male et al16 additionally adjusted for socioeconomic status , vitamin/mineral supplements, and birthweight. None of the studies adjusted for race/ethnicity, but each included a homogeneous sample. Other iron status outcomes : The evidence available from 4 studies did not s how a consistent association between the duration of any human milk consumption and other iron status outcomes. o Thorsdottir et al20 reported significant correlations between the total duration of human milk consumption and serum ferritin and the ratio of transferrin receptor to serum ferritin 34 at 12 months; longer duration was associated with better iron status. However, this study may be prone to reporting bias because it is unclear whether other outcome measures described in the study (i.e., mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, and transferrin receptor) were not assessed at 12 months or were not reported (possibly because they lacked statistical significance). o The remaining 3 studies did not find any significant associations between duration variables and hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, or serum iron at 6 and 12 months and mean corpuscular volume, transferrin saturation, or transferrin receptor at 12 months . 2,7,16 The analyses in the study by Bradley et al2 may have lacked statistical power because they compared small groups of infants fed human milk for different durations. Isomura et al 7 and Male et al ,16 however, used their full samples (N=86 and N=488, respectively) to examine duration as a continuous variable. o The inconsistenc ies in the findings may be due to differences between samples in the consumption of human milk, infant formula, cow milk, complem entary foods, and iron supplements. Bradley et al2 studied infants fed human milk for 1 -8 weeks and infants fed human milk for 6 months. Isomura et al7 estimated that, at 6 months, 82% of infants were partially to completely breastfed (i.e., considering the proportion of infants' total milk intake that was human milk). As described previously, Thorsdottir et al 20 reported that 77% of infants were breastfed at 6 months and about 12% were breastfed at 12 months, and participants in the study by Male et al16 were breastfed for a mean of 3.6 \u00b1 3.9 months. As described previously, the sample in the study by Male et al16 may have consumed more infant formula and less cow milk than the sample in the study by Thorsdottir et al.20 Bradley et al2 specified that breastfed infants could consume up to 1 supplemental feeding per day of a low -iron formula and then consumed a low - iron formula from the end of the breastfeeding period (i.e., 1- 8 weeks or 6 months, depending on the group) until age 12 months. Isomura et al7 specified that, at 6 months, 35% of infants were predominantly formula- fed (i.e., <5% of the ir total milk intake was human milk). Neither Bradley et al2 nor Isomura et al7 reported cow milk intake. Thorsdott ir et al20 did not report intake of complementary foods, but the other studies specified that infants were consum ing compl ementary foods and beverages by the time outcomes were measured. Male et al16 reported that 91% of infants consumed meat almost every day by the time outcomes were measured. Thorsdottir et al20 and I somura et al7 did not report supplement use, although Isomura et al7 noted that infant supplementation was not recommended in Japan at the time of the study. Bradley et al2 reported that mineral supplements were not prescribed to any infants and Male et al16 reported that 11% of infants were given iron supplements at the time of the outcome measure. Precisi on: The precision of the evidence cannot be adequately assessed. The body of evidence had only 5 studies, and most were likely to have sufficient statistical power (i.e., 2 studies reported significant findings ,8,20 and 2 with nonsignificant findings examined duration as a continuous variable using the entire sample7,16). However, an assessment of precision is hindered by the lack of reporting of data that would allow for a comparison of the magnitude of effect across studies . The studies that reported significant 35 findings did not report effect sizes , 8,20 and one of the studies that reported a nonsignificant association did not report any data.16 Directness: The evidence has moderate directness. Three of the 5 articles reported study objectives that included the examination of whether the duration of human milk consumption is related to iron status .7,16,20 Generalizability: The evidence has limited generalizability. Iron deficiency, anemia, and iron deficiency anemia were examined at 12 months and not at any other time during the birth to 24 month period. N one of the studies examining iron deficiency and anemia were conducted in the United States , but rather represent White European,16 Icelandic ,20 and low -income Arab8 populations . A large proportion of the sample examined by Thorsdottir et al20 consumed cow milk and a large proportion of the sample examined by Jaber8 took iron supplements prior to 12 months, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the United States . With regard to other iron status outcomes , the studies measured outcomes at 6 and 12 months, only, and not the rest of the birth to 24 month period. Only 1 study was from the United Stat es, and participants in that study were mostly W hite.2 The remaining studies included White European children ,16 Icelandic children,20 and children from Japan.7 As described above, findings from the Icelandic sample, where cow milk was consumed by a large proportion of infants before 12 months, may not be generalizable to the United States . Risk of bias: There is a limited likelihood that the des ign and conduct of the studies have prevented or minimized bias. None of the studies accounted for all of the key confounders listed on the analytic framework although, as noted above, Male et al 16 accounted for most of them. In addition, none of the studies accounted for any of the other factors to be considered from the analytic framework, although Male et al16 did adjust for infectious illness , which is related to inflammatory biomarkers. T he lack of adjustment for the timing of cord clamping is worth noting due to its potential to impact anemia. 5Fvi The studies were prone to other risks of bias , which varied between studies (Tables 5 and 6). vi Dewey KG, Chaparro CM.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.) 40 Zinc status Five articles, published between 1986 and 1994 , examined the relationships of ever compared with never consuming human milk, and different durations of any human milk consumption, with zinc status from birth to 24 months . 2,11,12,17,18 No evidence was identified that met the inclusion criteria to examine different durations of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula or different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants. Description of the evidence comparing ever with never consuming human milk ( Table 7 ) Four articles present ed evidence comparing the zinc status of infants who ever consumed human milk with that of infants who never consumed human milk .2,11,12,18 Populat ion The samples of infants were from the United States , China, Germany, and the UK. The investigators followed participants starting at birth. Most studies included infants born full -term and/or with a normal birthweight; however, Salim et al18 included participants born with a gestational age of 32 to 42 weeks and 28% of participants had low birth weight. Participants from the U.S.-based study were mostly W hite. 2 Authors of the remaining 3 studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their samples. Interve ntions/exposures and comparators Infants who consumed human milk: Two studies included a group of infants fed human milk exclusively. In the study by Lombeck and Fuchs ,11 infants were only fed human milk throughout the observation period. L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen12 did not specify the duration of the exclusive human milk -feeding period. One study , by Bradley et al,2 included groups of infants fed human milk, but not exclusively. One group was fed human milk 6 months with up to 1 supplemental feeding per day of a low-iron formula. The other 2 groups consumed human milk for 1 to 8 weeks and were then randomized to consume formulas with different levels of iron. One study, by Salim et al,18 did not report sufficient information to determine the exclusivity of the human milk exposure. Infants who never consumed human milk: In the study by Lombeck and Fuchs ,11 parents who decided to formula feed selected the formula. Families wit h no history of atopic disease chose 1 of 11 different cow milk formulas, whereas study staff recommended partially hydrolyzed whey protein formula to parents of children with a family history of atopy. In 3 studies, parents who decided to formula feed were assigned to a formula by research staff. Bradley et al , 2 L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen,12 and Salim et al18 randomly allocated infants to formula s with different levels of iron, different levels and sources of protein, and different levels of copper, respectively. In addition to human milk and infant formula, some infa nts consumed complementary foods and beverages and/or supplements prior to the measurement of zinc status. In the study by Bradley et al ,2 infants could consume complementary foods and beverages, 41 including iron- fortified cereals , starting at 4 months (i.e., prior to the outcome measures at 6 and 12 months). Mineral supplements were not prescribed to any of the infants. L\u00f6nnerdal and Chen 12 and Salim et al18 did not report whether any infants received complement ary foods and beverages or supplements prior to the measurement of outcomes between 2 and 12 weeks. Outcomes The studies measured serum zinc at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks12 and at 6 and 12 months ,2 plasma zinc at 8 to 10 weeks18 and 4 months ,11 and urinary zinc at 4 months .11 Synthesis and assessment 6Fvii of the evidence comparing ever with never consuming human milk ( Table 7) The evidence examining the association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and zinc status from birth to 24 months is inconclusive. In the synthesis and assessment of the evidence that follows, several limitations are described that make it difficult to draw a conclusion. Consistency : The evidence has limited consistency. The evidence i s inconsistent with regard to the statistical significance of the findings , and there is not enough information to determine whether this relates to statistical power . o Two of 4 studies reported statistically significant associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and zinc status . 11,18 All 4 studies also reported nonsignificant associations. o This inconsistency may be due to differences in statistical power , but it is difficult to know for sure because no ne of the studies reported power calculations . o This inconsistency may also be due to methodological differences, such as differences in the exposure (which included different durations of any and exclusive human milk feeding), comparator (which included several different types of infant formula) , outcome (which included serum, plasma, and urinary zinc measured at time points between 2 weeks and 12 months), or other factors (e.g., confounding) . Both statistically significant associations showed that i nfants who ever consumed human milk ha d higher zinc status than infant s who never consumed human milk . o Salim et al18 found that plasma zinc was significantly higher at 8 to 10 weeks in infants fed human milk than in infants fed a high- copper formula. However, plasma zinc was not significantly different between infants fed human milk and infants fed a low -copper formula. o Lombeck and Fuchs11 found that plasma zinc was significantly higher at 120 days in infants fed human milk exclusively than in infants fed cow's milk formula. When the authors stratified this analysis by sex, they found that the difference was significant in female participants but not in male participants. Plasma zinc was not significantly different between infants fed human milk and infants fed hypoallergenic (i.e., cow's milk vii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

Urinary zinc was not significantly different between infants fed human milk and infants fed either type of infant formula; however , the authors did not report the sample sizes or data so this finding is difficult to interpret. Precision: The precision of the evidence cannot be adequately assessed. There is not enough information to determine whether the body of evidence has an adequate number of sufficiently powered studies. o There are only 4 studies in the body of evidence. o As previously described, there is not enough information to determine whether the studies had sufficient statistical power to exami ne the relationships of interest. Across the 2 statistically significant associations , mean plasma zinc levels differed in infants with similar exposures ; for example, infants fed human milk had mean plasma zinc levels of 17.6 \u00b1 5.8 mol/l 18 and 12.15 \u00b1 1.73 mol/l .11 The difference is difficult to interpret because of methodological differences between studies , such as differences in diet ( e.g., Salim et al18 did not report whether human milk -fed infants consumed formula or complementary foods and beverages ) and differences in the age at outcome meas ure (i.e., 8 to 10 weeks and 120 days). Directness: The evidence has moderate directness. Three of the 4 articles reported study objectives that included the comparison of zinc status between human milk -fed and formula- fed infants. Generalizability: The evidence has limited generalizability . Participants in the U.S. study were primarily W hite and no other studies reported race or ethnicity. Salim et al18 examined a sample in which 28% of infants were born with low birth weight. Participants' exposure years were from the early 1980s to 1991. Therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to infants who consume formulas currently on the market.

Participants in the U.S.-based study were mostly W hite 2, and the study from Denmark did not report race or ethnicity .17 Interventions/exposures and comparators Michaelsen et al17 examined the duration (but did not report the unit of time) that infants were fed human milk at least once per day. The intake of infant formula, complementary foods and beverages, and supplements were not reported. Bradley et al2 compared infants who consumed human milk for 6 months with infants who initially consumed human milk (range 1- 8 weeks) and then, after mothers decided to stop feeding human milk, were randomized into 2 groups fed infant formulas with different levels of iron. Human milk -fed infants could consume up to 1 supplemental feeding per day of a low -iron formula. Infants could consume com plementary foods and beverages starting at 4 months (i.e., prior to the outcome measures at 6 and 12 months). Mineral supplements were not prescribed to any of the infants. Outcomes The studies measured serum zinc at 6, 9, and 12 months. Synthesis and assessment 7Fviii of the evidence comparing different durations of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk (Table 10) The evidence examining the association between the duration of any human mil k consumption and zinc status from birth to 24 months is inconclusive. In the synthesis and assessment of the evidence that follows, several limitations are described that make it difficult to draw a conclusion. Consistency and Precision: The consistency and precision of the evidence cannot be adequately assessed. With only 2 articles in the body of evidence, there are insufficient data to comment on consistency or precision. Further, Michaelsen et al 17 did not report data. Neither article reported statistical power. Directness: The evidence has limited directness. Neither article reported study objectives that included the analysis of zinc status based on the duration of human milk consumption. Generalizability: The evidence has limited generalizability. viii A detailed description of the methodology used f or grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -review s and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

Further, participants in the study were primarily W hite and the study from Denmark did not report race or ethnicity. Risk of bias: There is a limited likelihood that the design and conduct of the studies have prevented or minimized bias. One of the studies accounted for none of the key confounders on the analytic framework , 17 and the second study only accounted for 1 key confounder .2 The studies were prone to other risks of bias ( Tables 11 and 12) which varied between studies. 49 Table 10.

Description of the evidence comparing different durations of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk ( Table 13) Thorisdottir et al19 observed a cohort of full term, singleton, Icelandic infants from birth to 12 months. They assessed the correlation between the number of months infants were fed human milk once or more per day and serum 25(OH)D at 12 months. The median duration of any human milk feeding was 8 months (interquartile range: 6, 10), and from 9 to 12 months it was estimated that about 22% of infants had regular intake of fortified products with vitamin D, 18% had regular intake of supplements with vitamin D, and 33% had regular intake of both fortified foods and supplements. Synthesis and assessment 8Fix of the evidence comparing different durations of any human milk consumption among infa nts fed human milk (Table 13) Insufficient evidence is available to examine the association between the duration of any human milk consumption and vitamin D status from birth to 24 months. The body of evidence consists of a single study, which found a nonsignificant correlation between the duration of any human milk feeding and vitamin D status at 12 months. The study accounted for 1 key confounder on the analytic framework and was prone to other risks of bias ( Table 14 ). ix A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agri cultural Research Service, Washington, DC.) 53 Fatty acid status Nine articles, published between 1986 and 2016, examined the relationships of ever compared with never consuming human milk, different durations of any human milk consumption, and different durati ons of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula with fatty acid status from birth to 24 months . 4-6,10,13 -15,21,22 No evidence was identified that met the inclusion criteria to examine different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants. Description of the evidence comparing ever with never consuming human milk ( Table 15 ) Seven articles present ed evidence comparing the fatty acid status of infants who ever consumed human milk with that of infants who never consumed human milk .4-6,10,13- 15 Population One study included a sample of infants from the United States and Canada.6 Four studies, from the same research group, included different participants who likely represented the same population of infants in Australia.4,13- 15 One study included a sample of infants from Spain.5 The remaini ng study did not report the study location, which was likely either Germany or Belgium .10 All of the studies followed full -term infants with normal birthweights starting at or close to their birth. Gil et al5 included participants with vaginal deliveries, only. The participants in 2 of the 4 studies from Australia were W hite, only ,14,15 and the remaining studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their samples. Interventions/exposures and comparators Infants who consumed human milk: Two studies included a group of infants fed human milk exclusively for the duration of the study5,6; however, Gil et al5 specified that infants' initial 3 feedings in the hospital after delivery were a 5% dextrose solution. The 4 studies from A ustralia examined infants fed human milk, but not exclusively. o In the earliest study, infants were fed human milk, but not infant formula, for the first 16 weeks (complementary feeding was not reported), and 120 ml of infant formula could be supplemented per day between 16 weeks and the final outcome measure at 30 weeks . 13 o In the studies from 1999 and 2000, human milk feeding could be supplemented with infant formula in the amount of 200 ml per week . 14,15 The study from 1999 did not report complementary feeding, but the study from 2000 reported that about 36% of human milk -fed infants consumed complementary foods by the 16- week outcome measure. o Gibson et al4 recruited a group of infants whose mothers intended to feed human milk for the entire birth to 7- month observation period. At 7 months, 59% of infants in this group were consuming 80% of milk feeds as human milk, and 100% were consuming complementary foods and beverages. The remaining study did not report whether infants consumed complementary foods and beverages during the birth to 3- month observation period, so the exclusivity of the human milk exposure cannot be deter mined. 10 54 Infants who never consumed human milk: In all of the studies, parents who decided to formula feed were randomly assigned to a formul a by research staff. Each study included a standard infant formula as well as formulas supplemented with dietary nucleotides , 4,5 linoleic alpha- (ALA) ,6,14 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ,13 or arachidonic acid (AA) and DHA .10,15 Outcomes The studies ex amined fatty acids from plasma and/or erythrocytes across a range of ages from 1 week to 7 months. Synthesis and assessment 9Fx of the evidence comparing ever with never consuming human milk (Table 15) The strength of the evidence examining the association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and fatty acid st atus from birth to 24 months is moderate. In the synthesis and assessment of the evidence that follows, the strengths and limitations of the evidence are discussed. Consistency : The evidence has moderate consistency. The evidence is consistent in showing t hat ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is related to fatty acid status , but the direction and strength of associations can vary depending on the composition of the infant formula fed to participants who never consumed human milk , as well as th e specific types of fatty acids examined in the blood. For example, 3 studies compared infants fed human milk with infants fed a conventional infant formula and infants fed DHA - or DHA- and AA -supplemented formula. 10,13,15 In comparison to consuming human milk, consuming a conventional infant formula was generally associated with significantly lower DHA levels , whereas consuming DHA - or DHA- and AA - supplemented formula was generally not associated with, or associated with significantly higher, DHA levels. It is likely that the composition of human milk similarly affects the significance and direction of the associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human mi lk and fatty acid status. However, the studies in this body of evidence were not designed to examine human milk composition or its effect on infant fatty acid status (see Directness, below) . Precision: The evidence has moderate precision. The body of evidence had 7 studies, and they had sufficient statistical power to detect significant differences for many of the analyses of interest. However , an assessment of precision is hindered by the heterogeneity of the analyses. Directness: The evidence has limited directness. The studies in this body of evidence were generally designed to examine the effect of novel infant formula compositions rather than the difference between infants fed human milk vs. infant formula. x A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietar y-guidelines -advisory -committee in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 55 Generalizability: The evidence has limited generalizability. Participants' exposure years were from the early 1980s to 2002. Therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to infants who consume formulas currently on the market. Only 2 studies reported race or ethnicity, which was 100% White (this was an inclusion criterion for study eligibility) . 14,15 In addition, 4 studies, from th e same research group, included different participants who likely represented the same population of infants in Australia . 4,13,15 Risk of bias: There is a limited likelihood that the design and conduct of the studies have prevented or minimized bias. None of the studies controlled for any of the key confounders on the analytic framework. These studies were all described by the study authors as randomized controlled trials (to test the effects of different infant formula compositions on infant outcomes), and successful randomization minimizes bias from confounding. However, the data of interest for this systematic review are the compar isons of the randomiz ed formula- fed groups to non- randomized infants fed human milk; therefore, there is a risk of bias from confounding. The studies were prone to other risks of bias ( Table 16 ), which varied between studies. In addition to the graded elements of the assessment of the evidence, above, publication bias may be a concern because the body of evidence consisted of a small number of studies that all reported significant associations. 56 Table 15.

Infants fed human milk exclusively for 2 months or less were compared with infants fed human milk exclusively for 6 months or more. Infants fed human milk for 2 months or less were randomly assigned by research staff to a group fed a standard infant formula or a group fed DHA- and AA -supplemented infant formula. Erythrocyte membrane fatty acids were measured at 6 months. Synthesis and assessment 11Fxii of the evidence comparing different durations of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula (Table 19) Insufficient evidence is available to examine the association between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and fatty acid s tatus from birth to 24 months. The body of evidence consists of a single study, which found that the associations between longer, compared with shorter, duration of exclusive human milk feeding and erythrocyte fatty acids depended on the composition of the infant formulas consumed by the infants no longer being fed human milk . For example, infants fed human milk exclusiv ely for 6 months had significantly higher erythrocyte DHA than infants fed a standard infant formula after receiving human milk exclusively for up to 2 months , whereas there was no significant difference in erythrocyte DHA between infants fed human milk ex clusively for 6 months and infants fed a DHA- and AA -supplemented infant formula after receiving human milk exclusively for up to 2 months . The study did not control for any of the key confounders on the analytic framework. xii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.) 86 Research recommendations 1. Evaluate the most useful biomarkers of nutrient status for infants and children under two years of age, and cutoff values appropriate for identifying both deficiency and excess in this age group. Nutrients of interest include those addressed in this review (iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and fatty acids) , but may also include some that were not addressed (e.g. choline, iodine). Rationale: Across the body of evidence, there was heterogeneity in the methods used to assess nutrient status, in part because there is uncertainty about the most appropriate biomarkers to use in this age group. During infancy, there are profound changes in the average values of certain biomarkers between birth and 12 months, such as hemoglobin and markers of iron status, due to normal physiological changes. This makes the identification of appropriate cutoff values challenging. Serum zinc is useful as a marker of zinc status at the population level, but has serious limitations for use at the individual lev el. For fatty acid status, interpretation of results may differ depending on whether serum/plasma values or red blood cell values are assessed, whether samples are collected in a fed or fasted state, and on how the results are expressed (e.g. as percentage of total fatty acids, or as concentrations). 2. Measure and account for the other key factors that may play a role i n studies of how infant feeding practices affect nutrient status . These factors includ e: birth weight, gestational age and nutrient status at birth; maternal diet and nutrient composition of her breast milk; use of nutrient supplements by mother or infant; consumption of infant formula and the fortification level of the formula; consumption of complementary foods and beverages, particularly fort ified products; and other potential factors , such as exposure to sunlight (for vitamin D status), timing of umbilical cord clamping (for iron status), rate of weight gain (for iron status), and inflammation (for iron and zinc status). In addition, report t he analytic group sizes and power calculations. Rationale: The associations between breastfeeding or formula feeding practices and nutrient status are likely to depend on all of the factors listed above, given the complex etiological pathways for each of t he nutrients of interest. The evidence available is difficult to interpret because none of the studies included a comprehensive assessment of such factors. Nonsignificant associations are difficult to interpret because of a lack of information about whether all studies were sufficiently powered to examine the relationships of interest. 87 Included articles 1.
