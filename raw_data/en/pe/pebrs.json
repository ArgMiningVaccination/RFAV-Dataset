Nursing Pathways You can read about the pathway of three registered nurses, who became anthroposophical nurses through the course at Taruna. This short article gives an idea of how the nurses integrated anthroposophic nursing into their professional practice. You can read about them here: [Anthroposophic Nursing Pathways](https://www.taruna.ac.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Anthroposophic-Nursing-Pathways-interview-write-up-final-1.pdf) Venue Taruna College, 33 Te Mata Peak Road, Havelock North, Hawkes Bay. Student Support Taruna aims to ensure that the programmes delivered are beneficial to each and every student. Support is available to all students via the Course Coordinators whilst on-site and in between seminars to ensure that progress is achievable. Crystal Bridge was founded in 1991 as an initiative to help students at Taruna College with their course fees, at a time when there was no possibility of government-sponsored student loans. The fund is open to all New Zealanders wishing to undertake study, locally or internationally, based on the work of Rudolf Steiner. Loans are interest-free and tailored to the individual borrower, but are usually repaid over 1-2 years. There is also a fund or gift money, the prerequisite for such a gift being that it benefits a group of people. Donations to the fund are gratefully received. The [Crystal Bridge loan fund](https://www.taruna.ac.nz/about-us/crystalbridge-loan-fund/) makes interest free loans available to students enrolled in Signature Courses at Taruna. Anthroposophic Nursing - an introduction (Adaption of a translated article by Rolf Heine the Coordinator of the International Forum for Anthroposophic Nursing in Anthroposophische Pflegepraxis. Salumed; 2015.) Extensive concepts for nursing practice, training and research based on Rudolf Steiner's approach to knowledge have been developed within the anthroposophic nursing movement since 1923. The aim of anthroposophic nursing is to assist people to find their individual way - on the level of body, soul and spirit - during phases of life when they are ill and dependant on care. Nurses in collaboration with doctors and therapists have been contributing to the realisation of a spiritual art of healing. Anthroposophic nursing understands the human being to be a free, evolving being that has manifold connections to self, nature, culture and the cosmos on the various levels of body, soul and spirit. Nursing serves to maintain, or where necessary, regain or redevelop these connections. Each human being is the measure of these evolving interactions. Each biography, illness or social relationship has its own patterns and rhythms, that seldom progress in a linear fashion. Research and understanding of these connections and their significance for human freedom form the basis for developing concepts for nursing, training and research. Anthroposophic nursing is not founded on a closed, normative, theoretical system. Rather, it can arise wherever nurses rely on an anthroposophic background understanding from which to provide professional care out of knowledge and love, with presence of mind. Knowledge and love, as well as all other traditional virtues and values of the nursing profession, are not morally normative imperatives. They are developmental opportunities within each nurse or therapist, who is responsible for her or his own conscience. The nurse, like the patient or client, is a human being in a process of development, whether professionally or personally. Self-chosen professional progress or regression can be seen not just in terms of outer skills and competence. Professional progress is also found in the readiness to cultivate emotional and spiritual qualities such as love and compassion. Spiritual nursing care will concern itself with questions of reincarnation and karma, as well as with questions about the spiritual and social significance of the various work specialities, such as that of perinatal care or the care of patients who are in a vegetative state. It is only against such a background that ethical questions become objectively discussable, outside the constraints of a normative code of practice. "}
