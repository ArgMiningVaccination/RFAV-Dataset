Discuss this with your surgeon during your first postoperative visit, but the general rule is nothing in the vagina for eight weeks. (This includes tampons, douche products, and having sexual intercourse). Your bowel takes time to recover from surgery. By the time you are discharged, you should be passing \"gas\" or flatus. This should continue once you are home. Your first bowel movement should occur 4-5 days after surgery. You may experience \"gas\" pain. Drinking hot liquids and walking will help relieve discomfort. You should use a stool softener such as Colace (docusate) and a mild laxative such as Senokot (sennosides) or Milk of Magnesia, which you can purchase at the drugstore. You should continue the Colace and laxative until you have stopped taking the pain medication or your stools become unusually loose. Sometimes cancer and cancer treatment can change sexual function and desire. The Sexual Health Program at Dana-Farber provides a comfortable, supportive environment where you can talk with a health care professional about your questions and concerns.
