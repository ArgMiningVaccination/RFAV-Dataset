Unfortunately, only a subgroup of patients responds and shows long-term survival to these therapies. Tumor vaccines and cellularimmunotherapies could synergize with checkpoint blockade, but which of these treatments is mostefcacious is unknown. In this meta-analysis, we assessed the ef cacy of tumor vaccination and cellular immunotherapy in NSCLC. Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT s) investigating cellular immunotherapy or vaccines in NSCLC. We used random effects models to analyze overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), expressed as hazard ratios (HRs), and differences in time (months). The effect of immunotherapy type, disease stage, tumor histology, and concurrent chemotherapy was assessed using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. All procedures were performedaccording to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results We identi ed 18 RCTs that matched our selection criteria; these included a total of 6,756 patients. Immunotherapy extended NSCLC survival and PFS, expressed as HR (OS: 0.81, and month difference (OS: difference, 5.43 months, 95% CI, 3.20 to 7.65, P,.005; PFS: difference, 3.24 months, 95% CI, 1.61 to 4.88, P,.005). Cellular therapies outperformed tumor vaccines (OS as HR: P= .005, month was a t of immunotherapy in low-stage compared with high-stage NSCLC and with concurrent administration of chemotherapyonly in one of four outcome measures evaluated (PFS in months: P= .01 and PFS as HR: P= .031, respectively). There was no signi cant effect of tumor histology on survival or PFS. Conclusion Tumor vaccines and cellular immunotherapies enhanced OS and PFS in NSCLC. Cellular immu- notherapy was found to be more effective than tumor vaccination. These ndings have implications for future studies investigating combination immunotherapy in NSCLC.

Recent advances include the targeting of severaldriver mutations responsible for tumor progression. Targeting the mutant EGF receptor and the EML4-ALK fusion protein has been found effective;however, resistance to these therapies inevitablyensues. 3-5Therefore, novel treatment strategies to improve NSCLC survival are warranted. Immunotherapy aims to establish or en- hance an effective immune response toward thetumor. This can be accomplished via differentstrategies, including tumor vaccination, adoptive transfer of immune cells, and modi cation of the \u00a9 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology 1 http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JCO.2015.66.3955 The latest version is at Published Ahead of Print on July 18, 2016 as 10.1200/JCO.2015.66.3955 Copyright 2016 by American Society of Clinical OncologyDownloaded from jco.ascopubs.org by JCO Gratis on August 1, 2016 from 12.19.83.34 Copyright \u00a9 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

This formof therapy has proven to be safe and effective in eliciting tumor-speci c immune responses in different cancers, including NSCLC. 15-17It is also possible to circumvent endogenous a ntigen presentation by directly administering antigen-stimulated T cells or dendritic cells (DCs).18,19 Tumor vaccines and cellular therapies are aimed speci cally toward tumor antigens and, therefore, have a limited toxicity pro le as opposed to established chemotherapy and checkpoint blockade.20-22 Eliciting potent T-cell response via vaccines or cellular therapies and simultaneously releasing the brakes on these T cells with checkpointinhibitors may unleash the full potential of immunotherapy and improvethe proportion of patients responding to therapy. Synergies betweencheckpoint inhibitor therapy and tumor or cellular vaccines are currentlybeing investigated in several clinical trials. 23Which form of immuno- therapy; vaccine, or cellular therapy is most promising to combine withcheckpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 blockers is currently unknown.In this meta-analysis, we show that vaccination and cellular immunotherapies improved the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC. Cellular therapies out-performed tumor vaccines for all the outcomes assessed. Other factorssuch as tumor histology or the preconditioning of patients with low-dose cyclophosphamide had no effect on survival or PFS. METHODS Database Search On June 17, 2015, we searched for relevant studies in the following databases: Embase, Medline (Ovid SP), Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, Pubmed Publisher, and Google Scholar.There were no limitations on the year of publication for all the databasesinterrogated. Search entries were constructed for each individual database (Appendix, online only). The search initially involved other thoracic malignancies including small-cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. Nolanguage restrictions were applied. We also searched manually through conference abstracts and checked references from relevant publications and review articles. All procedures were performed according to thePreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines. 24 Eligibility Articles were included on the basis of title and abstract if they concerned clinical evaluation of a tumor vaccine or cellular immuno-therapy in NSCLC. Articles were excluded when they involved fewer than Records identied through database searching (N = 7,828)Additional records identied through other sources (n = 4) Records after duplicates removed (n = 5,992) Records screened (title/abstract) (n = 5,992)Records excluded (n = 5878): No thoracic malignancy, no cellular or tumor-vaccine therapy, no clinical patient data available, no original data, < 5 patients Records on active and passive immunization strategies (tumor vaccination and adoptive cell transfer) in thoracic malignancies Full-text articles assessed for eligibility: (n = 144)Records excluded: (n = 92) No RCT (n = 56) Preliminary data when more recent data available (n = 23) Insufficient data (n = 13) REffectiveness of Immunotherapy ecords matching inclusion criteria (n = 22) RCTs eligible for efficacy analysis (n = 18)Identification Screening Eligibility IncludedFig 1.

All articles on checkpoint blockade therapy or biologic response modi ers (e.g., interferons, in- terleukins) were excluded. When we obtained all records on vaccine and cellular therapies in NSCLC, we selected the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to study the ef cacy of treatment. Studies that were not ran- domized or lacked complete outcome data were excluded for this par-ticular research question. If multiple articles covered the same study population, the study with the most recent and complete survival data was used. Remaining studies that investigated the predictive value of immunefactors in blood were later used for systematic review. Authors of theindividual studies were contacted in case of missing data. Two investigators (F.D. and L.A.L.) independently screened abstracts and reviewed full texts for eligibility. Data extraction was performed (F.D. and G.D.M.V.)according to a prede ned data extraction form. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (J.G.A.). Data Collection and Outcomes Treatment characteristics (type and timing of treatment, dose) pa- tient demographics, tumor histology, disease stage (low-stage diseaseranging from I -II to IIIA and high-stage disease from III(B) to IV), and relevant outcome measures were collected according to a prede ned data extraction form. The outcome measures OS and PFS were assessed, and when PFS was not available, time to progression and relapse-freesurvival were included to increase the comparability and power of ouranalysis. These outcome measures were inconsistently reported as either hazard ratios (HRs) or as median months of survival or time to diseaseprogression or both, and all were included for further analysis. Tumor response rates were not evaluated because they were inconsistently re- ported and have been found to correlate poorly with immunotherapyefcacy. 25The risk of bias was determined using the Cochrane Collabo- ration risk of bias assessment tool.26 Statistical Methods Random effects models were used to compute summary effect sizes for all the outcome measures investigated, thereby taking heterogeneity across studies into account.27,28When available, HRs from different studies were pooled to calculate the OS bene t of vaccine and cellular immu- notherapy in NSCLC. Additionally, median differences were generated and combined when median survival times or median months of PFS were reported. We addressed several possible sources of heterogeneity (expressed as I2), including type of immunotherapy (tumor vaccine v cellular therapy), limited or advanced disease (stages I -II/IIIA vIII(B)- IV), histology (percentage of adenocarcinoma), preconditioning therapy withlow-dose case of vaccines), and concurrent ad-ministration of chemot herapy, using subgroup analysis and meta- regression (in cases where the percentage of adenocarcinoma was given). Funnel plots were generated to assess the presence of publication Table 1.

To de ne the extent of publication bias, the Duval and Tweedie trim- and-ll test and the classic fail-safe N test used.29The Begg and Mazumdar rank-correlation test and the Egger test were applied in cases of suspected publication bias to quantify the level of bias.30,31All analyses were performed by a biostatistician (L.R.A.), using a registered copy ofComprehensive Meta-Analysis statistical software (version 2.2.064; Biostat,Englewood, NJ). RESULTS Search Strategy Results and Study Characteristics of Included Trials Our database and manual searches yielded a total of 7,832 records, of which 5,992 records remained after duplicates were removed ( Fig 1 ). An additional four records were manually selected from conference abstracts and reference lists. All records werescreened on the basis of title and abstract to identify trials in- vestigating the bene t of tumor vaccination or cellular immu- notherapy in the context of NSCLC. After screening, a total of 114potential records remained that were eligible for full-text assess- ment. Of these, 18 individual randomized controlled trials (RCT)were eligible for subsequent meta-analysis. The 18 RCTs included in our analysis comprised a total of 6,756 patients treated with immunotherapy for NSCLC, distrib-uted over different outcome measures. A summary of the main study characteristics is presented in Table 1. Most studies focused on late-stage disease (15 of 18 trials of stage III(B) -IV disease). The type of treatment was evenly distributed, with 10 studies in- vestigating tumor vaccines and the other eight treating patientswith either DC therapy, a form of T-cell therapy (autologousactivated killer T [AKT] cells, or cytokine-induced killer cells[CIKs]), or a combination of the two. The proportion of ade-nocarcinoma histology varied extensively between studies, rangingfrom 28% to 88% of total cancers.

There were no studies that investigated the ef cacy of tumor vaccines or cellular therapies alone versus chemotherapy treatment. Immunotherapy Significantly Prolongs NSCLC Survival and Delays Tumor Progression Studies reported different outcome measures, with some reporting HRs of disease progression or survival and others reporting only median OS and/or time to disease progression inmonths. Therefore, we analyzed HRs and the differences in me-dians for survival and PFS separately. Cancer immunotherapy wasfound to be effective in extending NSCLC OS and PFS, both expressed as HR (cumulative OS: HR, 0.81, 95% 0.70 Fig 2) and median month difference (cumulative OS: difference, 5.43 months,95% CI, 3.20 to 7.65, P,.005; PFS: difference, 3.24 months, 95% CI, 1.61 to 4.88, P,.005; Fig 3). Cellular Immunotherapeutic Strategies Perform Significantly Better Than Tumor Vaccination Therapies There was a moderate level of heterogeneity between sample estimates for both OS and PFS expressed HR PFS: I2, 85.8%). To test whether this heterogeneity could be attributed to differences in type of immunotherapy (vaccine or cellular therapies), diseasestage (low vhigh), concurrent chemotherapy, histology (percentage of preconditioning with low-dose cyclophosphamide, subgroup analysis and meta-regressionwere performed.

All rights reserved.Signicant heterogeneity existed between studies evaluating tumor vaccination and cellular immunotherapy treatments, with cellular therapies being more effective than tumor vaccines for alloutcome parameters evaluated (OS as HR: P= .005 difference: P= .001; difference: P= .004; Table 2). There were no signi cant differences in survival or disease progression between studiesinvestigating immunotherapy in high- versus low-stage NSCLCdisease, except for the difference in median months of PFS, whichwas more favorable for studies involving low-stage NSCLC thanthose high-stage disease ( P= .010). Studies that evaluated immunotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy performed betterthan studies investigating immunotherapy alone only for time todisease progression as HR ( P= .030). There was no correlation between the proportion of patients with adenocarcinoma histologyand the standardized mean difference or PFS (P= .426; Appendix Fig A1, online only), nor could we detect a bene t of preconditioning with cyclophosphamide in case of the tumor vaccines (OS HR, P= .577; PFS HR, P= .928). Bias Assessment The level of bias varied extensively between studies, with several studies being de cient in thorough methodological reporting, which, in most cases, was because only an abstract wasavailable. 35,37,46,49The studies that properly reported randomi- zation procedures, blinding, and all outcome measures weregenerally low in bias, 20,21,32but selection bias and detection bias could be detected in some trials, or were not reported43,45,48(Fig 4). With the exception of three studies with an unclear risk of bias,35,37,46all studies lacked reporting bias, attrition bias, and other sources of bias not speci cally addressed by the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Funnel plots were constructed to investigate the presence of publication bias. There was no or minimal publication bias for OSexpressed as HR and median month difference (Appendix Figs A2A andA2C, online only). Adjusted values after the Duval and Tweedie trim-and- ll test revealed no signi cant alteration of the observed point estimate (data not shown). There was no publi-cation bias for the outcome PFS expressed as median monthdifference (Appendix Fig A2D ). There was, however, possible publication bias for PFS expressed as HR (Appendix Fig A2B ), as indicated by a potential loss of signi cance from the Duval andTweedie trim-and- ll test (data not shown). Additional tests to quantify publication bias were inconclusive (the Egger test wassigni cant for publication bias but the two-tailed Begg and Mazumdar test result was not). Also, the classic fail-safe N testindicated that 40 additional studies would be required to reachaPvalue greater than alpha ( P= .05, data not shown). There- fore, the presence of publication bias for PFS expressed as HRremains uncertain. DISCUSSION Targeting the immune system to combat cancer is an effective wayto enhance survival and prolong time until progression in NSCLC.In contrast to disease-modifying drugs such as cytokines(interleukin-2, interferons) and the recently investigated check-point inhibitors, tumor vaccines and cellular therapies induceformation of speci c tumor-directed cytotoxic T cells capable of destroying cancer cells. Because of their high speci city, based on the selection of only tumor-associated antigens, tumor vaccinesand cellular immunotherapies are associated with limited adverseeffects, but the ef cacy of these therapies, with tumor vaccines in particular, has been controversial. 50,51In this meta-analysis, combining the data from all published tumor vaccine trials re-sulted in a signi cantly improved survival and prolonged time to disease progression. These results were even more pronounced forthe cellular therapies. The distinction between these two immu-notherapeutic strategies was the only factor that was consistentlydifferent for all outcome measures analyzed. Other factors such as disease stage and combination chemotherapy also signi cantly differed regarding clinical ef cacy, albeit not for all outcome measures. Tumor histology was not signi cantly associated with changes in survival or time to disease progression. Large phase III studies such as the MAGRIT trial and the belagenpumatucel-L phase III trial were initiated following promising phase II results, but they were prematurely terminateddue to lack of clinical ef cacy. 50Discordant results of phase II and III studies in NSCLC research have been reported by others and arethought to arise from differences in phase II and III study-population characteristics, size, and the (intermediate) outcome measures and the target effect size aimed for. 52Most of the phase III studies included in our analysis concerned tumor vaccination Table 2.

Given the disappointing results of these trials, it is re-markable that in our meta-analysis, tumor vaccination therapiessignicantly enhanced survival and time to disease progression, suggesting insuf cient power in previous phase III trials.Even though there was no or limited publication bias for the majority of parameters investigated, overrepresentation of phase IIstudies in the cellular therapies included could have contributedto the differences in ef cacy compared with tumor vaccination therapy. On the other hand, the differences may be ascribed to theactivation of the immune system with cellular therapies such as DC and T-cell therapies. First, c ellular therapies partially or totally circumvent potential immune suppression induced by vaccination and, therefore, directly activate antitumor T cellsc a p a b l eo ft a r g e t i n gt h et u m o r . 18,53Second, whereas vaccines target one predominant tumor antigen, DC (and, to a lesser extent,T cells) activated in vitro could potentially induce a polyclonalantitumor response. 54,55This might prevent immune escape by the tumor and induce immune responses to a multitude oftumor antigens. Screening patients before v accination for expression of the targeted tumor antigen and designing personalized tumor vaccines could increase response rates to tumor vaccines. 56,57 Several studies have correlated a speci c immune response to the vaccine with increased survival and tumor responses fol- lowing therapy.32,58-65Identifying these patients before or after the rst vaccination as personalized therapy could speci cally bene t those that are most likely to respond and favor the use of combination treatment in nonrespondingpatients. We found a statistically signi cant effect of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for the HR of disease progression,but not for other outcome measures. Chemotherapy could syn- ergize with immunotherapies by causing immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and by disrupting immune evasion pathways, buttiming of combination therapies is crucial. 66We found no additive effect on tumor vaccine ef cacy of low-dose cyclophosphamide in our analysis ( Table 2 ), but this could be due to the limited amount of studies available for analysis. Also, few studies reported an-tibody responses toward the vaccine, making it dif cult to assess the effect of prior immune modulation. Importantly, to furthertarget immune-evasion pathways in patients, enhancing antitu-mor T-cell functionality with checkpoint inhibitors acting viaPD-L1/PD-1 blockade could further improve therapeutic ef cacy. 67 The PD-1 blocking antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumabhave been approved for NSCLC treatment, following positivephase III results. 7,8 There are several limitations relevant to this meta-analysis. First, there was a limited number of studies available for someoutcome measures investigated with subgroup analysis (e.g., OSHR for type of therapy and disease stage). Second, variabilityin control treatments with cellular therapies (BSC) and vaccinestudies (mostly placebo) could have biased our results in favorof cellular immunotherapy. Because of incomplete reportingand heterogeneity in methodology, we did not further in-vestigate potential immune markers (e.g., antibody responses following vaccination) that could be predictive for therapeutic efcacy. More studies will have to be awaited to properly address this issue. Finally, bias could n ot be assessed in several of the studies included. Therefore, we did not perform sensitivity analysis after exclusion of studies with a high or unspeci ed degree of bias. Several larger phase III studies on tumor vaccinesand cellular therapies are still awaited and it Selective reporting (reporting bias) Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)Allocation concealment (selection bias) Random sequence Unknown risk of bias? ++??+++ ????+++ ?????++ Fig 4.

However, to our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the rst analysis to give a com- prehensive overview of speci c immunotherapies in NSCLC, as- sessing both tumor vaccines cellular therapies. In conclusion, speci c immunotherapies signi cantly pro- longed NSCLC survival and PFS. Cellular immunotherapies were more effective than tumor vaccines for all outcome measures evaluated. Low-stage disease and the concurrent use of chemo-therapy improved ef cacy but only for disease progression in months and as HR, respectively. There was no association be-tween treatment ndings are for the design of future studies investigating immunotherapiesin NSCLC and possible synergistic combination strategies thatcould improve patient survival.AUTHORS 'DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Disclosures provided by the authors are available with this article at www.jco.org .
