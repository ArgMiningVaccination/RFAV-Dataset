In this act adopted at Windsor, July 2, 1977, Section 40 states in part that \"one grammar school in each county and one university in the state ought to be estab\u00ad lished by direction of the General Assembly\". No action was taken by the Assembly to establish a university except that in granting char\u00ad ters to towns, it did require that one right of land be established for the endowment of a college or university. By 1785 there was a substantial amount of public sentiment in favor of establishing a college or university in Vermont. In that year Elijah Paine of Williamstown offered the General Assembly the sum of 2,000 pounds. Four years later Ira Allen offered the sum of 4,000 pounds. These and other offers caused the General Assembly to appoint a committee to study the matter and to canvass the state in order to deter\u00ad mine where the university should be located. This committee reported to the session of 1791 at which time the General Assembly decided that a university was to be founded to serve the state. A ballot was taken on the question of location and a decision was made in favor of Burlington, presumably because of the substantial support offered by Ira Allen, the Rev. Samuel Williams, and their associates. The General Assembly further voted to create a committee to draft a charter of the University. The report of the committee was adopted with amendments on Novem\u00ad ber 3, 1791, as the charter law of the University of Vermont. The University became the twentieth college in the United States and the fifth in New England chartered to confer the bachelor's degree. It is worthy of note that the University is the second to be established by a state legislature after the formation of the United States. The action of the 1791 Legislature also makes The University of Vermont the oldest institution of higher education in the Green Mountain State. Thus did the founding Legislature of Vermont establish a university which was to develop like no other in the fledgling nation. While the enabling legislation provided for funding to come from rents, those were often fixed at \"$.25 per acre as long as grass is green and water runs\", and in any event were not reliably collectable. One result is the tradition, born of necessity, which has seen The University of Vermont develop in many of the same ways as the private institutions of the country have developed, with a substantial reliance on alumni and other private philanthropy. The first building was subscribed by citizens of Burlington and when fire destroyed that \"edifice\" in 1824, its successor, for which General 3 4 INTRODUCTION Lafayette laid the cornerstone, was again made possible by the citizens of Burlington. That building, the Old Mill \u2014 still in use today \u2014 was only the first in a long line to be made possible by private philanthropy. The list includes all but one of the buildings on University Row: Ira Allen Chapel, Billings, Williams, Old Mill, and The Royall Tyler Theatre. Morrill Hall, the first UVM building to be provided by state funding, did not come until 1907. Other buildings made possible by private philanthropy include Water\u00ad man Memorial, Southwick, Fleming Museum, Converse, Dewey and Lafayette Halls. Medical alumni and other friends raised approximately $7,000,000 to match federal grants to make possible the Given Medical Building, its Medical Alumni Building wing, and the Dana Medical Library. In addition to a challenege grant from the Dana Foundation, the project attracted a $2,000,000 grant from the Given Foundation, the single largest building gift the University has received to date. Alumni and other friends also raised more than $1,000,000 of the $3,000,000 cost the Patrick Gymnasium, Gutterson Field House, Forbush Pool complex. The remainder is being paid by students, through retirement of a bond issue. In like fashion, student rents have made possible most of the campus residence halls, which currently house about 4,000 of the University's 7,400 undergraduates. The University of Vermont was founded in a day when U.S. colleges and universities existed primarily to educate men for the professions, especially for the ministry. Yet, in studying University history, Professor Emeritus Betty Bandel discovered that \"this small institution located in a frontier community of New England became a pioneer in the kind of practical education which later became the basis for the establishment of the Land Grant universities \u2014 those institutions which made it possible for the sons and daughters of average citizens to aspire to a college education\". For example, she noted that the University is believed to be the first non-military institution to have offered engineering courses, and early alumni of the University included men such as John Kasson who was instrumental in founding the international postal system; and Henry Raymond, a founder of The New York Times. Tucked in the northwest corner of the Ira Allen Chapel grounds is a memorial to a late 19th century graduate of this University, philoso\u00ad pher John Dewey, whose ideas about practical education are still de\u00ad bated with passionate vigor. Ten Academic Divisions By contemporary standards, The University of Vermont is a rela\u00ad tively small university. INTRODUCTION 5 Its 7,400 undergraduates enrolling in eight colleges and schools \u2014 the Colleges of Agriculture; Arts and Sciences; Education and Social Services; and Engineering, Mathematics and. Business Administration; and the Schools of Allied Health Sciences; Home Economics; Natural Resources; and Nursing \u2014 share the 420 acre main campus with some 800 students enrolling in the Graduate College and another 320 in the College of Medicine. The Division of Continuing Education offers courses on campus and in many communities throughout the State of Vermont during the fall and spring semesters and during the Summer Session. The largest single share (about 30 per cent) of the University's current total operating budget of $65 million is obtained from student tuitions. Grants and contracts (the University is among the top 100 U.S. in\u00ad stitutions of higher learning in competition for federal research, train\u00ad ing and equipment grants) account for about 25 per cent. The state appropriation is currently about 18 per cent of the total budget. The remainder comes from a variety of sources, including alumni and other private philanthropy, endowment, sales and services and auxiliary enterprises. Endowed Chairs Since the establishment of the Williams Professorship in Mathematics in 1853, the University has been the recipient of a number of generous endowments intended to support teaching and research in various aca\u00ad demic fields. Among them are: The Williams Professorship of Mathematics, 1853, honoring Azarias Williams of Concord, Vt., merchant and judge, native of Sheffield, England, who in 1839 deeded to the University extensive holdings in land, at that time valued at $25,000. In return he received a small annuity during the remaining ten years of his life. The Marsh Professorship of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, estab\u00ad lished in 1867 to honor James Marsh, distinguished UVM president and philosopher of the 1830's. Many alumni contributed to the fund which established this chair. The Pomeroy Professorship of Chemistry, established in 1878 by John N. Pomeroy, A.B., 1809, who lectured on chemistry and later, during his career as a lawyer in Burlington, served as trustee of the University. He was awarded the LL.D. in 1861. The Howard Professorship of Natural History and Zoology, estab\u00ad lished in 1881 by John Purple Howard, a Burlington resident who was a generous benefactor both of the University and of the City of Burlington. The Flint Professorship of Mathematics, Natural or Technic Science, frequently awarded in the field of civil engineering, established in 1895 6 INTRODUCTION by a bequest from Edwin Flint, A.B., 1836, lawyer and judge in Wiscon- son and Iowa until his death in 1891 in Mason City, Iowa. The Converse Professorship in Commerce and Economics, established in 1899 as a result of an endowment made by John H. Converse, A.B., 1861, LL.D., 1897, Philadelphia railroad financier, who as a trustee of the University proposed the teaching of Latin, modern languages, his\u00ad tory, bookkeeping, penmanship, and other subjects necessary to men and women. The Thayer Professorship of Anatomy, established in 1910 to honor Dr. Samuel White Thayer, Dean of the College of Medicine from 1854- 71 and 1880-82, from contributions made by alumni of the College of Medicine. The McCullough Professorship of Political Science, established in 1926 through grants made by Gov. and Mrs. John G. McCullough of Bennington, Vt. Gov. McCullough was a lawyer and attorney general in California during the mid-nineteenth century; later a railroad finan\u00ad cier and benefactor of many educational and other enterprises during his long residence in Vermont. The Perkins Professorship of Zoology, established in 1931 to honor George H. Perkins, for sixty-four years a teacher of science and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for many years. Grant for this profes\u00ad sorship was made by John E. Lynch of Boston, Mass. The Shipman Professorship of Ophthalmology, established in 1934 by a bequest from Dr. Elliot W. Shipman, M.D., 1885. After beginning his practice in Vergennes, Vt., and studying ophthalmology in Berlin, Dr. Shipman practiced medicine in Richmond Hill, N.Y., for thirty- five years. The Corse Professorship of English Language and Literature, estab\u00ad lished in 1952 by Frederick M. and Fannie C. P. Corse. Mr. Corse, A.B., 1888, and registrar and teacher of mathematics and economics in the University during the 1890's, was general manager for Russia of the New York Life Insurance Company, with offices in Stalingrad (Petrograd) for seventeen years before the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Lawrence Forensic Professorship of Speech, established in 1965 by Edwin W. Lawrence, lawyer and financier of Rutland, Vt., A.B., 1901, generous patron of forensic, activities at the University. The Sanders Professorship, established in 1968 as a chair endowed by the alumni, honoring the Rev. Daniel Clarke Sanders, first president of the University. Statement of Purpose The University of Vermont is a community of scholars, and it exists to promote the survival and enrichment of man and his environment INTRODUCTION 7 by contributing to the improvement in the quality of life in Vermont and the larger society . . . broadly conceived to encompass the educa\u00ad tional, cultural, social, medical, economic, and technological dimensions of human experience. The University aspires to contribute to the improvement in the quality of human experience and the conservation of the environment through the performance of three broad missions. These include transmission of knowledge and understanding and the development of human potential, both intellectual and personal, through its education programs; Expansion and organization of knowledge and understanding through research and other creative endeavors; and Dissemination of knowledge and understanding and the application of such knowledge and understanding to solving problems of importance to Vermont, the region, and society at large. Together, these missions comprise the public service role of the University of Vermont and they provide the basis for its general educa\u00ad tional goals. The University Libraries In the Guy W. Bailey Library, the main unit of the University Libraries, are located the services and collections relating to the humanities, social sciences, and many of the sciences. This library holds the largest book and map collection in Vermont, and maintains a representative collection of the major periodicals, scholarly journals, indexes, and abstracting services. It is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications. The Special Collections Department includes the Wilbur Collection of Vermontiana, rare books, literary and historical manu\u00ad scripts, and the papers of many individuals associated with State and the Federal government. A separate Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Cook Physical Science Building. Collections in medicine and the health sciences are located in the Dana Medical Library. The University Archives in the Waterman Building contain the permanent, official records of the University. Conferences and Institutes An increasing number of groups hold educational conferences, insti\u00ad tutes and seminars on the campus of the University, which is pleased to cooperate in making its facilities available for this purpose whenever it is possible to do so. Charges are made to cover costs to the University. Further information may be obtained through the Office of Confer\u00ad ences and Institutes. 8 INTRODUCTION Vermont Educational Television Vermont Educational Television is the public television network owned and operated by the University of Vermont, serving the state. With studios and offices on the Fort Ethan Allen campus, the network provides an instructional service to schools, college courses for credit, programs for children out-of-school, and a broad spectrum of Eastern Educational Network and Public Broadcasting Service programs for Vermonters. Locally produced programs address the concerns and issues. Programs are broadcast over WETK-TV, channel 33, Burlington; WVTB, channel 20, St. Johnsbury; WVER, channel 28, Rutland; and WVTA, channel 41, Windsor; and on channels 74, 76, 79 at Manchester, Wilmington, and Bennington. Student Life STUDENT PERSONNEL SERVICES A STATEMENT OF MISSION Until recently, the student personnel function at most universities was traditionally thought of only as a function of control of student behavior through rule enforcement and strict discipline. As modern universities began to re-evaluate their missions they assessed the total educational experience on their campuses. This led to a concern about the quality of student life on campus and the impact of campus environments on students. This was the beginning of Student Personnel Services as they are known today. As a result, student personnel edu\u00ad cators began to develop programs to meet some specific developmental needs that were common to college age young adults. It should be recognized that students are going through a period of rapid personal growth while on the college campus. In addition to de\u00ad veloping new academic skills, they are being challenged to pursue new ideas, evaluate their values systems, change existing attitudes, and investi\u00ad gate new life styles. They are exploring future career options and learning social and interpersonal skills. Therefore, the broad focus of the Student Personnel Services at the University of Vermont is to provide support services to students during this time of intense personal development and intellectual growth, in addition to playing a leadership role in developing experiences, policies, and programs to provide learning and leadership opportunities for students in concert with the formal instructional mission of the institution. To accomplish this mission the student life areas are divided into various functional departments and programs. Each of these provide or coordinate support services and educational experiences to meet student needs. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER The Counseling and Testing Center is a human resource center avail\u00ad able on a no-fee basis to UVM matriculated students, faculty, and staff. We are concerned with increasing the power of individuals and groups to live more effectively and more confidently through greater under\u00ad standing of the self, others, and the nature of change. A professional staff offers confidential individual and group counseling for a wide range of concerns \u2014 educational, vocational, personal and social. The Center also provides a testing service ranging from vocational testing to national exams. We also have an outreach program with a variety of growth experiences; study skills workshops, women's groups, life 9 10 STUDENT LIFE style planning, values clarification, and such. Referral to other appro\u00ad priate specialties such as Psychiatric Services,- Reading Center, and Career Planning and Placement is also available. 146 South Williams Street 656-3340 CAREER PLANNING AND PLACEMENT The Office of Career Planning and Placement is organized to provide all students with comprehensive assistance in exploring and implement\u00ad ing their career objectives. This function consists of two major efforts. The first is to provide direct assistance to students in clarifying career objectives based on their own skills, interests, needs and abilities. The primary emphasis is through self-awareness, occupational awareness, skill development, and finally entry into the career areas which are complementary to their desired lifestyles. This process is accomplished through one-to-one counseling and/or small group workshops. Along with providing career counseling, students will find the information contained in the Career Resource Library helpful in developing their career goals. The library, which is located within this office, contains literature on various fields, occupational outlooks, salary surveys which are updated four times per year, government opportunities at all levels, as well as a variety of literature describing current career opportunities in both large and small corporations in the private sector. For those students contemplating further graduate study, the library contains two complete guides to all graduate programs in the country and a variety of graduate school catalogues from other universities. This information is expanding and being updated continuously in the behalf that effec\u00ad tive choices must be based on current and reliable information. Once a student has been able to develop some tentative goals the office assists in his/her attempts to implement these goals. The office has a very active on-campus recruiting program which brings local and national employer representatives to campus for employment interviews. All part-time and summer employment opportunities are posted and made available to students attempting to offset a portion of their educa\u00ad tional expenses or gain experience in a field of their interest. To assist students in their employment search, the staff will provide help in devel\u00ad oping an effective resume, conducting employment interviews, compil\u00ad ing a credentials file, and help in drafting an overall employment search program. Students are encouraged to make use of the Office of Career Planning and Placement early in their educational program. Having a goal or direction to your education will enable you to make effective career- related decisions. 109 South Prospect Street 656-3450 STUDENT LIFE 11 FINANCIAL AID Students enrolled (or planning to enroll) in at least six credit hours, who feel they are unable to meet college expenses, are urged to apply to the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in the form of grants, loans, and employment. Entering undergraduate students who wish to apply for aid may do so by: (1) indicating their intention on the Admissions Application Form, and (2) submitting the Family Financial Statement (not the Parent's Confidential Statement) directly to the American Col\u00ad lege Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa. The Family Financial Statement forms may be obtained from local high schools or by request to the Office of Financial Aid, 330 Waterman Building, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05401. Forms should be submitted to American College Testing no later than April 1. ALL STUDENTS REQUESTING AID SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: A.

Vermonters: Vermont residents must apply to the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, 156 College Street, Burlington, VT 05401. > 2. Non-Vermonters: The University has very little scholarship/ grant aid for non-resident applicants; thus, aid usually is in the form of long-term loans and/or work-study assistance. Non\u00ad residents should explore scholarship opportunities available in their home states and communities. ALL STUDENTS MUST REAPPLY FOR AID EACH YEAR Continuing students can obtain an Upperclass Financial Aid Application from the Office of Financial Aid. They must also submit the Family Financial Statement to the American College Testing Program. Both forms are available early in the Spring semester from the Office of Financial Aid. Preference is given to those students who have complete applications on file by May 1st. Applications received after that date will be processed in chronological order according to the date received, subject to the ' availability of funds. 330 Waterman Building 656-3156 VETERANS AFFAIRS This office provides support, coordination of services, and advising to any veteran or dependent eligible for benefits under Federal Law, Chapters 31, 34, or 35. Those persons eligible for these benefits should contact the office at least one month prior to registration each semester. 12 STUDENT LIFE Those persons wishing to register for benefits should be prepared to present their certificate of eligibility to the Veterans Coordinator. It is important that all veterans and dependents keep in contact with this office for the latest information with regard to benefits and require\u00ad ments. Also, those students involved in the Veterans Program should contact this office in the event of any change in credit load, depending status, address, or major. 318 Waterman Building 656-4220 READING CENTER The University Reading Center, located in the Waterman Building, provides a free program for students who wish to improve their reading, vocabulary and study techniques. Some tutorial services are also avail\u00ad able. The first semester classes are open primarily to freshmen whose college entrance examinations indicate such a need. However, other students who are in need of improvement are urged to enroll in the read\u00ad ing program. Students who enroll are expected to attend regularly throughout the semester. 406 Waterman Building 656-3838 SPEECH AND HEARING CENTER Services of the Speech and Hearing Center, located in Allen House, are free to students in the University who have problems of speech, language, voice, and hearing: for example, problems of articulation, dialect, stuttering, inefficient voice production, hearing loss, and those problems associated with such conditions as cleft palate and cerebral palsy. Allen House 656-3861 OFFICE OF VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS OVP, a center for service-learning, provides the means for students to work at community projects, either on or off campus, as a part of their educational program at the University. Through service-learning a student may work in education, administration of justice, social services, health, economic development, environmental, governmental, recrea\u00ad tion or commercial settings as an added dimension of undergraduate or graduate learning. Students may participate at various levels of intensity, either as volunteers, as interns or as University Year for ACTION Interns. Students often become involved initially as volunteers, either through contract with a sponsoring agency or program or through a student project such as Big Brother/Big Sister, Council for Exceptional Children, Adopt-A-Grandparent, Vermont Special Olympics, GYST (Get Your Stuff Together), C-AHEAD (Center for Alternatives in Higher Educa\u00adSTUDENT LIFE 13 tion). Students may organize and coordinate a project as a part of the Project Coordinator's Council, The P.C.C. is an organization of student project coordinators, funded by the Student Association, which works in \"partnership\" with OVP to meet community needs. As volunteers, students gain valuable experience and explore personal and career inter\u00ad ests as they perform community tasks. Students may choose to integrate some of their academic and com\u00ad munity interests as they select courses and programs that allow for service to be combined with study. OVP assists students and faculty in designing appropriate service-learning assignments. The Community Service- Learning Internship Program is provided for students who want to become involved on a more extensive basis (for example, for a semester or half-time for a year). OVP assists in project planning and contracting arrangements and provides a seminar for student participants. Interested students may apply for acceptance to the University Year for ACTION Program, which enables students to become totally involved in service-learning, full time for a year. Students work with faculty and agencies to plan for involvement in UYA during the year prior to actual placement. The UYA Service-Learning design is tailored to meet the unique needs of each participant. During the actual UYA year, students work in agency projects under supervision of program staff while simul\u00ad taneously fulfilling academic objectives and evaluation requirements with faculty. UYA's also receive a stipend to cover living costs and are expected to live in the communities where they work. Through the Volunteer program, the Community Service-Learning Internship Program and University Year for ACTION, OVP assists students, faculty and agencies with information, project planning and technical assistance. OVP also provides financial, transportation, train\u00ad ing, publicity and personal support required to achieve student service- learning goals. Staff: Harold D. Woods, Director; David A. Osgood, Assistant Direc\u00ad tor; Donna L. Lavins, Program Coordinator. Mansfield House 25 Colchester Avenue 656-2062 PREMEDICAL/PREDENTAL ADVISING The Premedical/Predental Advising Office, located within the Dean of Student's Offices, exists to provide assistance and support to all students preparing for entry to medical and dental schools. The office provides general counseling, advising and referral services to students with academic and non-academic questions and concerns. Students are encouraged to use the office early in their careers in plan\u00ad ning their undergraduate experience to ensure that specific pre-professional 14 STUDENT LIFE requirements are met and that the background they are obtaining best fulfills their individual educational and personal goals, while simultane\u00ad ously meeting the requirements of medical/dental schools. Also, students not already assigned a premedical/predental academic advisor may re\u00ad quest the assignment of an advisor through this office. Information and advice is provided to students who are in the process of applying to medical, dental, and other health professional schools. The Premedical/Predental Advisor works in coordination with the Premedical/Predental Advisory Committee in preparing student letters of evaluation, as required by the majority of medical, dental, and health professional schools as part of the application process. Materials for registration for the required pre-professional examina\u00ad tions and application services are available. A resource library is also maintained for the use of students. This library contains medical and dental school catalogues and catalogues for professional schools in related health fields, as well as miscellaneous health careers literature. Students are encouraged to explore their personal and career goals through participation in small group discussions organized by this office. 316 Waterman Building 656-3380 Student Activities Participation in student activities is a vital part of any student's educa\u00ad tion at the University. The Student Activities office serves as a resource center for students seeking direction and support for the development of experiences and programs that offer recreation, learning, and leader\u00ad ship opportunities. This office totally involves itself in working with students to verbalize their needs and interests, determine their own goals and objectives, develop and produce their own programs, and evaluate their own experiences in terms of personal growth and future program direction. This is the kind of participation in university life that students have found to be a vital part of their total education. However, it is left up to the individual to contact the Student Activities Office to take advantage of these opportunities. There are approximately 70 student organizations that exist on the UVM campus. These organizations develop out of a unique interest area common to a group of students. Some of the larger organizations are listed below: Alpha Lambda Delta John Dewey Philosophy Club American Society of Civil Judo Club Engineers Lacrosse Club American Society of Mechanical L'Amicale Francaise Engineers Lawrence Forensic Anthropology Club Meeting of the Ways STUDENT LIFE 15 Ariel Baseball Club Billings Center Governing Board Campus Crusade for Christ Catalina Club Chi Epsilon Beta Christian Science Organization Council for Exceptional Children Cynic East Asian Club El' Club Hispanico Ethan Allen Rifles Forestry Club Friends of Geology Gay Student Union Geographic Forum German Club Gymnastics Club Home Economics Horse Club International Club Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship Student Pre-Law Student International Meditation Society Third World University Players UVM Band UVM Folk Dance UVM Plant & Soil UVM Rescue UVM Rugby UVM Sailing Modern Dance Workshop Mortar Board News and Weather Outing Club Office of Volunteer Programs Panhellenic Council Pershing Rifles Phi Chapter of Omicron Nu Physical Education Majors & Minors Pre-Vet Club S.

As such, it is a multi-purpose building used as a focal point for student activities. The facilities of the building provide space for lectures, films, small theatre and musical presentations, small and large group meeting rooms, study and recreational lounges, and the Catamount Den, a snack bar facility. Billings also houses several student organization offices, i.e., Student Association, Greek Coordi\u00ad nating Council, Women's Organization, Gay Student Union, Billings Center Governing Board, Cynic, Ariel, Concert Bureau, Speakers Bureau, and Films Bureau. 16 STUDENT LIFE The Student Activities Office, located in Billings Center, provides many services to students in addition to advice and information on pro\u00ad gram development and planning. An all-campus information number, 656-2068, provides complete details on campus programs, rides wanted and offered, apartment listings, and general referral information. There is also a sales desk for newspapers, candy, cigarettes, and bookstore supplies which is open on weekends and evenings. UVM STUDENT ASSOCIATION All students enrolled in the undergraduate colleges and schools are charged a student activities fee and thus become members of the UVM Student Association. Student Association serves as the all-campus student governing body. It assumes responsibility for voicing student concerns and interests in the political activities of the university com\u00ad munity. S.A. also determines the recognition of student organizations on campus and the allocation of funds to a large number of student organizations. They provide publicity and supply services for their constituents, and assume a major role in all campus programming through their Concert Bureau, Film Bureau, and Speakers Bureau Each year S.A. holds elections for student senators who serve on S.A.'s standing committees. There are many opportunities for other students, as appointed by S.A., to serve on various university ad hoc committees throughout the year or work on the variety of programs S.A. involves itself with each year. INTER-RESIDENCE ASSOCIATION (IRA) The Inter-Residence Association is a government which represents the students living in University residence halls. The government, consisting of an executive board, legislative council, and judicial board, provides leadership for residence hall students, representing their interests to other constituencies within the University community. IRA involves itself in all aspects of residence hall life, constantly seeking new ideas and avenues for the manifestation of these ideas to make the residence halls meet the needs of its residents. FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES The Greek System is an active and viable part of student life. It has long been acknowledged as an integral part of the social and extracur\u00ad ricular life on campus. The governing body of the system is the Greek Coordinating Council. The GCC performs two vital functions for the collective. It serves as a vehicle for communication between houses and assumes responsibility for conveying Greek interests and concerns to the University. The Dean of Students, through the Office of Student Activities, works with fraternities and sororities to accomplish those goals established in the best interest of the Greek and University communities.

WRUV-FM began operation as a 100 watt educational station in 1965. Both stations are S.A. recognized organizations and as such are student operated and programmed, offering full radio media services to the university com\u00ad munity. These stations operate at a professional level although they do have the informal atmosphere associated with a student organization. Any undergraduate interested in having a radio show or being involved in the stations' operations should drop by the stations located at Pomeroy Hall. DRAMA AND DEBATE The Royall Tyler Theatre is the home for the Season of Plays pre\u00ad sented each year by the Department of Communication and Theatre with the University players, as well as the home for the annual Cham- plain Shakespeare Festival.

THE ROBERT HULL FLEMING MUSEUM The Fleming Museum houses a distinguished teaching collection of art and ethnography. Originally founded as the Park Gallery in 1873, the collection owes much of its growth to the generosity of alumni and other friends. The O.B. Read American Plains Indian collection and the David B. Pitman '32 and Henry Schnakenberg collections of American art are notable examples. A spacious Marble Court is devoted to Euro\u00ad pean art. Rotating exhibits drawn from the collections are arranged in surrounding galleries given to Ancient, Oriental, Ethnographic, and American art. Changing exhibitions occur monthly. Frequently they are organized by faculty and students in Museum Studies, Art History or Studio Art. Lectures, gallery talks, recitals, films, and children's tours serve the community at large; activities supported by the Museum Association, whose membership is open to all. A center for the study of Art History and Museology, the Museum houses the Art Department collection of 75,000 slides and photographs, audio-visual class and seminar rooms, as well as a reference library for Museum research.

HONORARY AND RECOGNITION SOCIETIES Honorary and recognition societies exist on the University of Vermont campus to recognize student contributions to the university community and student leadership in campus life. There are a few local societies, i.e., Boulder Society, that acknowledge individuals by class. National Honorary Societies represented on the University of Vermont campus include: The Phi Beta Kappa Society established the Vermont Alpha Center at the University in 1848 and initiates are chosen primarily on the basis of high scholastic standing, with emphasis on a broad distribution of liberal studies, including language and literature. The local chapter was the first in Phi Beta Kappa to initiate women into membership. Mortar Board is a national honorary society for senior women and men. Although membership in Mortar Board comes as a high honor for a University of Vermont student in recognition of outstanding service, scholarship, and leadership, it is also a challenge for continued sound and honest scholarship, and for unselfish service in the best interests of the college campus. The Society of the Sigma Xi, established at the University in 1945, initiates those who have proved their ability to do research in one of the sciences including students who have a high scholastic standing.

Upperclass students who are actives or pledges of a fraternity or a sorority may register for University residence hall housing or chapter housing. All freshmen students, except those living at home and com\u00ad muting, or those living with their spouse, must live in University housing. RESIDENCE HALLS Contracts for room and board are binding for the college year unless cancelled for due cause with the sanction of the Office of Residential Life. In August, each new student will receive notification of a housing assignment and the date and hour of the opening of his/her residence hall. Rooms may not be occupied until the date specified. Each student is expected to leave the residence hall not later than twenty-four hours after his/her last examination at the close of each semester.

Students provide their own bed linen, towels, window draperies, pillows, metal wastebaskets, bureau covers, desk lamps and reading lamps. All students living in the residence halls must have board contracts. In order to facilitate maximum educational growth from the residence hall experience, a diversity of residence halls and programs are offered. There are freshman halls, upperclass halls, an environmental hall, a French house, and the Living and Learning Center (additional informa\u00ad tion on the Living and Learning Center is on page 135). Each residence hall is under the guidance and direction of a Hall Advisor who is a mem\u00ad ber of the Student Personnel Staff. In addition, the Hall Advisor is assisted by specially selected undergraduate Resident Assistants. These staff members encourage the development of intellectual, social and cultural programs and assist the residents in their growth toward maturity and responsible self direction. Each student in the residence halls is a member of his residence hall student government organization which represents student opinion and provides educational and social programs for its constituents. FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES Chapters of Greek letter fraternities and sororities have long been recognized as part of the intellectual, social, and extracurricular life on the campus. These groups provide valuable experience for their members in the form of interfraternity athletic competition, dances, service projects, house operations, meal service, and educational programs. Fraternities and sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Dean of Students Office. Greek activities are coordinated by the Greek Coordina\u00adSTUDENT LIFE 23 ting Council, the central governing body of all of the Greek letter houses. MARRIED STUDENT APARTMENTS Located just outside Winooski, on Route 15 at historic Fort Ethan Allen, the University's Married Student Apartments, known as County Apartments, are a four-mile drive from the main campus. Built in 1969, the development consists of 89 apartments located in eleven two-story buildings. There are 56 garden apartments (42 two-bedroom and 14 one-bedroom) and 33 town house apartments (all two bedroom).

Problems requiring prolonged and sophisticated care may be treated at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, or when feasible, at a hospital nearer the student's home. Long term psychiatric care is to be accomplished through a local psy\u00ad chiatrist outside the Health Services and at the student's expense. Athletic pre-participation physical examinations and care of athletes is supervised by Health Service Physicians and Trainers. The two Trainers are registered Physical Therapists supported by Student Train\u00ad ers, administering their care at the University Health Center and the Patrick Gymnasium Training Room.

Students treated by home town physicians must have a note from that physician to the Health Service to accomplish this necessary excuse or if treated by a Burlington physician the same procedure must be followed. Admissions to the University Applications and Deadlines The University of Vermont welcomes applications from all interested students regardless of race, religion, nationality, or sex. Prospective freshmen and transfer students interested in applying for admission in either January or September can receive applications by writing to: Office of Admissions, University of Vermont, 194 South Prospect Street, Burlington, Vermont 05401. Applications for admission in January should be received in the Admissions Office by December 1, while applications for admission in September should be on file and complete by February 1 (April 1 for transfer applicants). Upon filing an application all candidates are required to pay a non-refundable $20 application fee which is used to meet the cost of processing the application.

Vermonters applying under this program will be notified concerning admission during the first week of December if the application, high school transcript, SAT scores and recommendations have been received by November 1. Students who receive offers of admission under this program will have until May 1 to respond. Admissions Criteria Qualification for admission is determined on the basis of the secondary school record, rank in graduating class, recommendations, and College Entrance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Test results. Each application is carefully reviewed by the Admissions Office staff and in many cases by the College or School to which the student is applying. The candidate's record is thoroughly examined in order to determine whether the student has adequately prepared for the academic program of his choice. Sons and daughters of alumni of the University of Vermont are encouraged to apply and are given special consideration. Increasing competition means that the University must evaluate the application of each alumni son or daughter in terms of the total number of applica\u00ad tions, their relative qualifications, and the limitation which must be placed on the number of applicants who may be offered admission to the various academic programs which are available. 26 ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY 27 Most prospective freshmen present at least 16 high school units, in\u00ad cluding a minimum of four years of English, two years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, two years of science, and two years of social sciences.

Exceptionally qualified students may in some instances be admitted even though they do not meet the above requirements in full. Additional courses in mathematics, history, science, the fine arts and music, and a third year in the foreign language are strongly recom\u00ad mended as desirable preparation for college. In evaluating the second\u00ad ary school record, careful attention is given to the course load a student has been carrying and any advanced work is given special consideration. A student planning to major in music must arrange for an audition and interview with the chairman of the department during the year pre\u00ad ceding entrance. Interviews and Visits The University differs from a number of other colleges in not re\u00ad quiring a personal interview. Students are encouraged to visit the campus to form their own first-hand impressions about the University. Prospective students may schedule an appointment with a current UVM student or a staff member on most weekdays during the academic year in order to gain information about the academic and non-academic aspects of undergraduate life. On most Saturday mornings while the University is in session, in\u00ad formation group sessions will be held on campus for interested students and parents. Students should write or call the Admissions Office (802-656-3370) for additional information about the group meetings or individual appointments.

If a course is dropped after mid-semester, no refund will be made. At the end of the semester, an audit will again be made of each student's enrollment and if the number of courses, taken both for credit or audit, exceeds the number for which the student has been charged, a supplemental bill will be issued.

In no case will a refund be made after the first day of classes of the following semester. All medical withdrawals must be approved by the University Physician. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund for any of the reasons listed, an appropriate portion of the refund will be returned to each aid source on a pro-rata basis according to the proportion each aid amount is to the student's financial aid budget for the period for which the refund is being made. General Information This section offers a summary of regulations and procedures for registration, change of enrollment, grades and advisement. It also gives a brief explanation of withdrawal, leave of absence, readmission rules, undergraduate degree requirements and residency rules. The im\u00ad portance of these regulations and procedure s cannot be underestimated. REGISTRATION Students in attendance must pre-register for the next semester at the designated time. Unless excused in advance by the dean of the college concerned, students that do not pre-register will be considered as dropped and may apply for read- mission after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester. Written approval of the Student's Dean is required to Pre-register for more than 18 credit hours. ACADEMIC ADVISING Effective Academic Advising involves an established rapport between student and teacher. Accordingly, each new student is assigned to a faculty advisor upon admission to the University. The student remains under the guidance of this advisor until a major has been selected, usually during the sophomore year at which time a departmental advisor will be assigned. Students with questions about academic planning should consult their advisor throughout the year and especially during the pre-registration period. To change academic advisors, students should contact the dean of their college. Each academic unit within the University maintains its own system for advising students. ADVISING RESOURCES In addition to an assigned faculty advisor, there are a variety of other advising resources offices available to University undergraduates. They are: The Advising Referral Center: assists students who are undecided about their academic plans. The Center also helps students with complaints and grievances about course instructions, scheduling, and other academically related problems. Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Advisor: assists undergraduate students with the admissions requirements for dental and medical school. A library of resource materials is maintained which includes literature on alternative health careers, school catalogs, and pre-medical education journals. Pre-Law Advising: the UVM Pre-Law committee assists students by providing meetings and panel discussions regarding career options in law. Advising also includes specific information on applying to law schools. A current collection of law school catalogs is maintained for interested students. Pre-Veterinary Advising: is available to discuss plans for graduate school and employment in animal science career areas. A selection of catalogs, pam\u00ad phlets, and other related literature is maintained. International Students and Scholars Advising: verifies immigration status, interprets immigration laws, and immigration forms to foreign students, faculty, and scholars. American students planning to study abroad should also make their plans through this office. Minority Student Advising: is an effort to meet the needs of students entering the University who demonstrate that additional support services are needed. 39 40 GENERAL INFORMATION Incoming freshman minority students may elect to take part in a \"Summer Enrichment Program\" held on campus for a month (3 credits). Career Planning and Placement: assists students who are exploring a variety of potential career options early in their academic careers. A library of career information and school catalogs is maintained. Veterans Affairs Advising: advises students of their G.I. Bill benefits in edu\u00ad cations. Counseling and referral on academic matters are available to veterans. CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT A student may add courses during the first week of classes and may drop courses without academic penalty during the first three weeks of classes. Any changes in enrollment after these periods must be authorized by the dean of the college in which the student is registered. Change of enrollment forms may be obtained from the Registrar's Office. PASS\u2014NO PASS PASS\u2014NO PASS course enrollments have been approved by the University Senate for implementation in September, 1968. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program student, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (or as many courses as he has semesters remaining for future transfer students) during his undergraduate career on a Pass\u2014 No Pass basis, beginning in his Sophomore year. These courses may not include any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. Only free electives (without condition) may be taken as pass-no pass. This option may not be used for electives within the distribution requirements of a college or department. Students who have enrolled in ineligible distribution elective courses on a pass-no pass basis prior to September 1, 1974, shall not be penalized. The student must complete all work normally required in these courses and he will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instructor will NOT be informed of the student's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"D\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASS. Neither \"P\" nor \"NP\" grades will affect the student's grade-point average. SECOND, that the following addition was approved by the Faculty Senate in January, 1974: \"Physical education (activity) courses, whether taken to ful\u00ad fill a requirement or as electives, will be available to students on a pass-no pass basis and shall not be counted as part of the six (6) standard courses described above.\" Procedure\u2014 1. Obtain a PASS\u2014NO PASS Request Form from the Registrar's Office and consult your academic advisor. 2. Obtain your advisor's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as Pass\u2014No Pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college dean. 3. Submit your request to be placed on Pass \u2014No Pass status at the Regis\u00ad trar's Office during the first week of the semester. Requests to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Note: Non-degree students cannot take courses on pass-no pass basis. AUDITING COURSES With the approval of the Dean and the instructor concerned, a regularly GENERAL INFORMATION 41 enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor and no grade credit is given for the work. Tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no circumstances will a change be made after the enroll\u00ad ment period to allow credit for courses audited. The approval of the Dean of Evening Division and Summer Session is neces\u00ad sary for auditing courses in those divisions. REPEATED COURSES A student who repeats a course loses any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade remains on the student's permanent academic record and is included in computing his cumulative grade average. ATTENDANCE Class A ttendance \u2014 Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself and toward the University. The primary penalty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. Absence from Classes \u2014 Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused absence, may result in a failing grade for that particular work. TARDINESS A student not present at the beginning of an exercise may be marked absent. RIGHT OF APPEAL Any student who believes that he has been unfairly treated in regard to absences may appeal to his academic dean. PRIORITY OF UNIVERSITY EXERCISES University academic responsibilities have priority over other campus events. Attendance at: 1. Regularly scheduled classes have priority over special scheduled common hour examinations. 2. Common hour examinations have priority over attendance at other activi\u00ad ties. FINAL EXAMINATIONS REGULATIONS 1. The examination period at the end of each semester is set by the official University calendar. 2. Semester examinations shall be given only during the regular examination period except by permission of the dean of the college on request of the chairman of the department. No examinations shall be given during the last week of the semester except lab exams given in courses with specific lab sections. 3. The time and place of each final examination are determined by the Registrar and a schedule is circulated and posted. Any change in the scheduled time or place may be requested by the chairman of the depart\u00ad42 GENERAL INFORMATION ment concerned, when conditions seem to warrant such special arrange\u00ad ment. Decision on such requests rests with the Registrar. 4. In every course in which a final examination is given, every student shall take the examination unless excused by the instructor. 5. A student who is absent from a final examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to his instructor within twenty-four hours. If the absence is due to any situtation beyond the reasonable control of the student, (e.g., illness or family tragedy) the instructor must provide the student with the opportunity to complete the course requirements. At the instructor's discretion, this may be an exami\u00ad nation or some other suitable project. The instructor may require evidence in support of the student's reason for absence. 6. If the absence is not reported as provided above, or is not excused by the instructor, the examination is regarded as failed. GRADES Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. A Excellent 4 points per semester hour B Good 3 points per semester hour C Fair 2 points per semester hour D Poor 1 point per semester hour F Failure 0 points per semester hour Other grades are: Au. Audit. Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to work of acceptable quality when the full amount is not completed because of illness or other emergency. It can be awarded only with the permission of the student's college dean. The dean may set the limit of time when the work of the course is to be completed. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. XC Extended Course. This grade is awarded at the end of the semester to a student who is enrolled in an identified course, the nature of which makes it unreasonable or impossible for the student to complete the re\u00ad quired work within the regular semester. NP Not Passed, not used in grade point average computation. P Passed, not used in grade point average computation. W Withdrawn, without penalty, not used in grade point average computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the computa\u00ad tion of grade point average. M Missing \u2014 Grade Not turned in by the Instructor. CLASS STANDING The designation of a student's class shall be determined by the number of credits completed. The divisions are as follows: Freshman 0 \u2014 29.9 credit hours Sophomore 30.0 \u2014 59.9 credit hours Junior 60.0 \u2014 89.0 credit hours Senior 90.0 and over credit hours TRANSCRIPTS Currently enrolled, as well as former undergraduate and graduate students, may obtain an official transcript of their permanent academic record by writing GENERAL INFORMATION 43 or telephoning the Office of the Registrar, 363 Waterman Building (802) 656- 2045. The charge is $2 for each transcript. Please allow a minimum of one week for normal processing, and three weeks following the end of a semester. The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of fees or other charges, including student loans and dining and housing charges. ACCESS TO RECORDS Students have the right to review any of their educational records maintained by the University. Students also have the right to have all educational records maintained in a confidential manner. In appropriate situations, students may choose to waive some or all of these protections, but such waivers must be clearly stated in writing. If a student feels an educational record to be misleading, or containing information which is inaccurate, a hearing may be scheduled to seek appropriate modification. Requests for review of records should be made to the Registrar. HONORS The Bachelor's degree may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are distin\u00ad guished and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude. Honors are determined in the following manner: Within the graduating class of each college or school, students in the top one percent will receive summa cum laude; the following three percent will receive magna cum laude; the next six percent will receive cum laude. The total number of honors awarded will not exceed ten percent of the graduating class of each school or college. Honors will be calculated on all grades received at this university. In order to be eligible for consideration, a student must have taken at least sixty hours (thirty hours for two year programs) at this university in which a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F has been awarded. DEAN'S LIST The deans of the undergraduate colleges publish at the beginning , of each semester the names of those full-time students who stood in the top 20% of each class of their college during the preceding semester. Full-time enroll\u00ad ment in this case shall amount to a minimum of twelve-credit hours in courses in which grades of A, B, C, D or F have been given. STUDENT LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY A leave of absence means that a student who is eligible for continued enroll\u00ad ment ceases to be enrolled while in good standing and is guaranteed readmis- sion. This policy benefits both the student and the University in that it enables a student to plan on readmission to the University and allows the University, by having records on the expected date of return of its students, to refine further the planning of the size of the student body. The following statements further define a leave of absence: a. Upon application to his or her academic dean a student may be granted a leave of absence by that dean when that application merits the commitment of the University to insure the student's readmission. b. A leave of absence must be granted for a finite period of time. 44 GENERAL INFORMATION c. A leave of absence normally may not exceed four semesters. d. A leave of absence normally may not be granted for the current semester after the last day on which courses can be dropped without penalty. e. A leave of absence may not be granted to students currently on academic trial or disciplinary probation. f. A leave of absence is distinct from withdrawing for medical reasons and is not granted for medical reasons. g. A leave of absence does not guarantee housing upon the student's return. h. A leave of absence guarantees readmission to the student's college in the University, if the student confirms his or her intent to return by the closing date for a normal readmission application (October 31 and March 31 preceding the appropriate semester). i. While on a leave of absence, an individual's student status is temporarily terminated. A leave of absence guarantees an individual's readmission only if he or she takes the appropriate action. j. Financial aid awarded but not used prior to a leave of absence will not be carried over. Reapplication for aid for the readmission period must be made according to normal Office of Financial Aid policies and procedures applicable to that period, k. A leave of absence should be confirmed by the appropriate form signed by both the student and the dean of the college involved. WITHDRAWAL A student who wishes to withdraw from college must first notify his academic dean in person or in writing. READMISSION Any degree student who has left school for one semester or more must write to their dean's office to request readmission. Students must apply for readmission by October 31 or March 31 preceding the appropriate semester of return. LOW SCHOLARSHIP The information below describes the general University regulations for low scholarship standing. The Studies Committee of each college may determine additional or supplementary requirements. Students with questions regarding their academic standing should consult with their college dean. 1. \"On Trial\"\u2014 a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. The students remain enrolled according to stated academic conditions of their college. b. Students are placed \"on trial\" by the dean, or the designated committee of the college concerned. Special academic conditions may be set in each case. Normally the period of \"trial\" status is one semester. c. The circumstance under which students are placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1)Any student who is readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enters \"on trial.\" (2) Generally a student is placed \"on trial\" if in any semester he has failed half or more of the hours of his enrollment but has been permitted to continue in college. (3) A student whose record has been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsatisfactory in any semester may be placed \"on GENERAL INFORMATION 45 trial\" or continued \"on trial\" even though he does not come within the provisions of section (2). d. A student who has earned fewer than thirty semester hours of credit and is \"on trial\" is barred from participation in all athletic and other student activities. 2. Separation \u2014 a. A student is dismissed from the University if he receives grades below passing in one-half or more of the semester hours of his enrollment in any semester unless he is allowed to continue by action of the designated committee. b. A student who fails to meet the condition of his trial or whose record has been unsatisfactory and consistently below the graduation average may be dismissed for low scholarship even though he does not come within the provision above. c. A student dismissed for low scholarship must address his application for readmission to the college taking the action. d. Any student dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons must receive written approval from his/her previous academic dean (or the Dean of Students for disciplinary cases) before enrolling in any University course. INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS A student who is or has been a member of any college of this University may transfer to another college of the University only with the consent of the deans of the two colleges concerned. In the case of veterans receiving educational benefits through the Veterans Administration, the change must also be approved by the advisor to veterans in the Dean of Students Office. UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the colleges and specific requirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective colleges. In addition to the course requirements of the curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the college in which the student is officially enrolled. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 42 semester hours of credit in residence at the University except that those who have com\u00ad pleted three years of premedical study in the University are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only on recommendation of the Academic Council and in cases of undue hardship. To qualify for a second bachelor's degree the candidate must have fulfilled all the requirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work, usually thirty hours, in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. PHYSICAL EDUCATION One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore years, is required of all undergraduate students in four-year pro\u00ad grams. The two credits earned in activities classes will be included in the total number of hours required for graduation. Students may opt to take activities classes on a pass-no pass basis. (For further details see the pass-no pass heading under General Information). Medical examinations are required of all new 46 GENERAL INFORMATION students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of Student Health. The Physical Education requirement for students pursuing two-year degree programs shall be one credit of course work earned in activities instruction. Students twenty-five years of age or older are exempt from physical education requirement. UNIVERSITY RESPONSIBILITY Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equipment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is expected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precaution. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is pro\u00ad vided by the Student Health Service. USE OF ENGLISH Correct English usage is demanded by all departments of the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, regard\u00ad less of contents. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usuage may be referred to the English department for additional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English on the college level. STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE Through an arrangement with a commercial insurance company, students are able to procure a student health insurance policy. Married students may procure coverage for their spouse and children. Further details may be obtained from the Infirmary. POLICY STATEMENT ON DISCRIMINATION As a public institution, the University of Vermont opens its doors and facilities to any student on the basis of his or her character and ability and irrespective of race, religion or nationality. In addition, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits dis\u00ad crimination on the basis of sex. No person shall be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of any program or activity at the University on such a basis. Students, either individually or in groups, who are unable to resolve a grievance arising out of sex discrimination may have a hearing before a special committee appointed by the president. Persons wishing to pursue this course of action may contact the President's Office. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE The University expects each student to maintain high standards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students as responsible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the sup\u00ad port of all local, State and Federal regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as he considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt by him of academic credits, his graduation and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel his GENERAL INFORMATION 47 registration at any time on any grounds, if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University policy on the above matters is explained in detail in \"The Cat's Tale.\" Each student is held responsible for knowledge and observance of these rules and regulations. UNIVERSITY RESIDENCY REGULATIONS The Vermont Legislature has established a lower rate of tuition for students who are Vermont residents. Such a policy appears to have as its objective the attempt to more evenly distribute the cost of operating and supporting the Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont between Vermont residents whose taxes have previously supported the University and non-residents who have not done so. The Legislature has stated that enrollment at an institution for higher learn\u00ad ing or presence within the State for purposes of attending an institution of higher learning shall not constitute residence for tuition purposes. IN-STATE STATUS REGULATIONS Adopted by the Board of Trustees December 14, 1974 The following requirements must be met by a student prior to being granted resident status for the purpose of admission, tuition and other University charges: 1. The applicant shall be domiciled in Vermont, said domicile having been continuous for one year prior to the date of application for a change in residency status. Changes in residency status shall become effective for the semester following the date of application. 2. Domicile shall mean a person's true, fixed and permanent home, to which he intends to return when absent.

These four areas of work are performed by the resident instruction division, the research division (Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station), the extension division (Vermont Cooperative Extension Service), and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the resident instruction division prepares students for professional careers. Upon receiving the bachelor's degree, students usually enter management, specialized services, education, or research \u2014 all these in areas related to agriculture, basic biological sciences, conser\u00ad vation, and international service. The evolution of society necessitates continual progress and change. Thus the challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is being met through programs designed to give a foun\u00ad dation both in the social sciences and the humanities plus a fundamental technical education. All programs in the College of Agriculture leading to the Bachelor of Science degree require 120 semester hours of prescribed and elective courses, plus two credit hours in physical education. The normal semester program includes fifteen to eighteen credit hours of courses. In each area of study certain courses are prescribed, with allowance made for the election of additional courses, to provide a well-balanced and integrated educational program and to insure reasonable concentra\u00ad tion. Faculty advisers counsel students in the selection of elective courses and educational problems. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The College of Agriculture awards the degree of Bachelor of Science in each of the following programs: Agricultural Economics Botany Agricultural Engineering Dairy Technology Technology Environmental Studies Animal Sciences General Studies Biochemical Science Occupational and Extension Education Biological Science Plant and Soil Science 48 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE 49 The programs are broad and flexible, with sufficient areas of concentration and electives to meet the specific needs and desires of the student. Therefore, responsible departmental advising is important in the development of each student's program. Every candidate for this degree, in consultation with his/her adviser, must choose one of the above programs upon entering the college. The candidate must then fulfill the requirements stated below. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS A. The successful completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours of course work plus two credit hours in physical education. B. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00. (This is an increase from 1.70 and applies to all students admitted for Fall 1976 semester [Class of 1980 or new transfers]. Students admitted prior to Fall 1976 are still under 1.70 minimum.) C. The successful completion of at least two courses in each of the following areas: 1. Writing, communication and public address 2. Science, mathematics and statistics 3. Fine arts, philosophy, language and literature 4. Social sciences D. Courses as specified in individual programs. Applicability of courses to specific areas will rest with the adviser and, if necessary, with the concurrence of the dean of the college. It is further recom\u00ad mended that courses chosen to fulfill these requirements be taken outside the department in which the student's program of study is located. Students desiring to complete teacher education programs and teacher certification must enroll in appropriate courses in the College of Education and Social Services, (see College of Education and Social Services Adviser \u2014 306 Waterman) PREPROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Students who are striving for admission to professional colleges such as dentistry, medicine and veterinary medicine can meet the undergraduate requirements for these programs through enrollment in the College of Agriculture. Those interested in human medical sciences usually enroll in biological sciences while individuals interested in veterinary medicine usually enroll in either animal sciences or biological sciences. Any student indicating a specific professional interest will be assigned a faculty adviser knowledgeable in that area. Competition for places in professional schools is very keen and a superior academic record throughout an undergraduate program is necessary to receive consideration for admission. Due to this intense competition, all potential candi\u00ad dates are encouraged to also complete the requirements in an area of secondary interest. Students applying to the College of Agriculture, and expressing an interest in medicine or preveterinary medicine, should present evidence of high perform\u00ad ance in high school level science and math courses, plus additional supporting documentation such as high SAT scores and strong letters of recommendation. Biological Sciences Core Students initially interested in the broad area of biological sciences may enroll in this core curriculum for the freshman and sophomore years. The curriculum is designed to permit students to continue in basic biology or to transfer to one of 50 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE the applied biology programs. In addition to the general college requirements listed, students should complete during the first two years the following courses or their equivalents: Biology 1, 2 or Zoo 9 and Botany 4; Math 19, 20 or Math 21; Chem 3, 16 or Chem 1, 2 and 16 or Chem 1, 2 and 131, 132; Microbiology and Biochemistry 55 (Microbiology). Course descriptions are listed under the appropriate departments. Programs available upon completion of the core curriculum are listed below. Students may wish to select offerings from these programs during the freshman and sophomore years in addition to the required courses stated above. Freshman & Sophomore Years Junior & Senior Years Take Biological Science Core Continue in Biological Science or transfer to Animal Science, Biochemical Science1, Botany or Plant and Soil Science 1 See Microbiology & Biochemistry A description of programs and concentrations follows. They are in alpha\u00ad betical order along with the other programs of the College. Agricultural and Resource Economics The Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics offers two major programs of study: the Agricultural Economics program in the College of Agri\u00ad culture and the Resource Economics program in the School of Natural Resources. AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS The objective of the agricultural economics program is to provide students with a strong background in the social sciences and specific training in basic economic theory and the economics of U.S. and World agriculture. Students choose one of three concentrations. 1. Agribusiness and Marketing: Courses prepare the student for managerial and sales positions with businesses, especially those that supply agricultural inputs or market agricultural products. 2. Farm Management: Courses prepare the student to manage a farm business or to work in the many service or educational fields related to agricultural pro\u00ad duction and credit. 3. Agricultural Economics: A professional program aimed at students who wish to continue their education in graduate school, to participate in agricultural development programs, or to conduct research in the economics of agriculture. Students in all three concentrations shall successfully completer minimum of thirty hours in the social sciences. Of these, at least twenty-four hours shall be in Agricultural and Resource Economics, Economics, or Business Administration, of which twelve hours shall be in Agricultural and Resource Economics courses of advanced standing. All courses must be selected in consultation with the student's departmental adviser. The number of courses required of all students is purposefully minimal. To be as flexible as possible, the student is encouraged to develop an individually tailored program through the careful selection of electives consistent with his objectives and departmental standards. RESOURCE ECONOMICS For a description of the program in Resource Economics, refer to the School of Natural Resources. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE 51 Animal Sciences Each student majoring in programs offered within this department shall successfully complete a minimum of eight semester courses in Animal Science, including at least five of advanced standing. Additional courses must be selected in consultation with the departmental advisers in order that the selected program can be individualized to more nearly meet the professional aims and goals of the student. DAIRY TECHNOLOGY This program has been designed to provide the scientific, technical, and practical instruction necessary to prepare the graduate for the numerous positions available in the dairy and food science field. The students who elect to place greater emphasis on the scientific aspect of Dairy Technology will find that they are prepared to work in quality control, research laboratories, and to do graduate study in dairy and food chemistry or bacter\u00ad iology. The student who desires to place greater emphasis on business and the social sciences may become qualified for numerous supervisory and manage\u00ad ment positions in the dairy and food industry. BASIC ANIMAL SCIENCE This program has been designed specifically for those individuals who are interested in careers in industrial research and development or university positions. The students who elect this program will be provided with the strong science background that is necessary for advanced study in such areas as physiology, nutrition, genetics, and related biological fields. ANIMAL TECHNOLOGY This program provides formal training in the theories and practices of the animal sciences with special emphasis on manage\u00ad ment and technical competence. It prepares the student for employment as a farm owner, manager, or field work with state and federal extension services, breed associations, hatcheries, farm organizations, and various commercial companies. ANIMAL INDUSTRY This program is primarily for those students who are interested in business. It prepares them for supervisory and management positions in industries related to Animal Science, such as those involved with the processing and sales of dairy, meat and poultry products; feed and fertilizer companies; farm equipment and supply agencies; advertising and public rela\u00ad tions; and other areas of public service. Biological Science This program is designed to provide flexibility in developing a background in biological sciences. Students may fulfill their course requirements by selecting basic and applied courses from the several biologically oriented departments (Animal Science, Botany, Microbiology and Biochemistry, Plant and Soil Science, Zoology, and others). Graduates of the program may continue their education in graduate school or professional schools or they may obtain employment in a variety of areas. Possible job opportunities would include basic and applied research in educa\u00ad tional institutions and governmental agencies, technical writing, employment with environmental consultants, etc. The following courses are required of all students in the Biological Science program following completion of the core requirements: genetics (one semes ter), 52 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE biochemistry (one semester), physics (two semester sequence), and statistics (one semester). In addition, all students must take six additional courses in basic or applied biology. These courses should be selected to include at least one course in botany or applied plant science, one course in zoology or applied animal science, one course in the area of evolution and diversity of life, one course in ecology, and two courses in physiology or biochemistry. Of these, at least one or more courses at the 200 level should be included. These courses are selected in consultation with the adviser from the diverse offerings of the various colleges and departments. Botany Students in the Colleges of Agriculture or Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. Each undergraduate plans a program in consultation with a personal departmental adviser. The emphasis on flexibility permits a choice of electives when planning for each individual's career. Cross-disciplinary study is encour\u00ad aged, as Botany, a fundamental science, is the base upon which education, research, and careers in both applied and basic plant science is built. Many students aim specifically for careers that do not require formal education beyond the Bachelor's degree, e.g., preparation for numerous positions in: agriculture, business, education, administration, government, industry, medicine, research, or their own businesses. Many other students prepare themselves for graduate education and professional careers requiring advanced degrees, e.g., careers in botany, biology, medicine, dentistry, agriculture, biochemistry, or environmental sciences. In either case, close attention is given to increasing the student's choices after college. Students are also encouraged in their senior year to enrich their botanical experience through individualized, original research and study with faculty members. Areas of interest include: anatomy, cell botany, cytology, ecolo\u00ad gy, phycology, physiology, plant development, plant pathology, and taxonomy. Required courses: Mathematics 21, 22; or Mathematics 21 and Statistics 111; or Mathematics 19, 20, and Statistics 111, Physics 15, 16; Chemistry 16 or preferably 131, 132; Biology 1, 2; Botany 101, 104, 105, and 109 or 160; two additional semester courses in Botany. A sequence of Botany 4 and Zoology 9 or vice versa may be substituted for the Biology 1,2 sequence. Six hours of modern foreign language are strongly recommended. Students may petition the department to substitute other courses for certain requirements in the planning of individual programs: Environmental Studies The College of Agriculture participates in the interdisciplinary University Environmental Program as described on page 131. Most students select the Coordinate Major Program and fulfill the requirements in one of the major programs available in the College. General Studies This program is designed for students seeking a general rather than a special\u00ad ized knowledge in the field of agriculture and related subjects. Through the proper selection of electives, a student may choose an area of concentration within the college and also select courses that contribute to a liberal education. Required: In addition to the basic college requirements each student must THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE 53 satisfactorily complete twenty-four hours in the College of Agriculture. All additional courses must be selected in consultation with and have the approval of the student's adviser. BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCE Contemporary biology increasingly demands knowledge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well-advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. To this end the program in \"Biochemical Science\" provides a coordinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Depending on the student's future plans and capability, three areas of concentration are possible: (1) Cellular Biochemistry which emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms; (2) Molecular Biology which focuses on the chemical and physical structures of subcellular particles; and (3) Nutritional Biochemistry which em\u00ad phasizes the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. Specialization in one of these concentrations normally commences in the Junior Year after completion of the Biological Sciences Core (pg. 49). Students are required to complete a minimum of three hours of physical chemistry (or eight hours for the Molecular Biology option), twelve hours of biochemistry and three advanced biology courses, two of which would be in their specialty (e.g., Nutrition, Physiology, Genetics, etc.). The Plant and Soil Science program is designed for students interested in horticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, and insect pest management as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber production or to recreation and the environment. The program is flexible and allows students to place their primary emphasis in either science or agri-business. Suggested groupings of courses have been developed by the department to be used as guides for students interested in General Plant and Soil Science, Soil Science, Plant Science, Ornamental Horticulture and Landscape Design, Horticultural Therapy, and Insect Pest Management. Specific courses, in addition to the core courses, are worked out between the student and the advisor. All students majoring in Plant and Soil Science must take Principles of Plant Science, Introductory Soil Science, Soil Fertility and Management, one semester of Seminar, two semesters of Chemistry (one semester of inorganic and one semester of organic), one semester of Mathematics or Statistics, Plant Pathol\u00ad ogy, and Insect Pest Management. A minimum of 6 additional courses in Plant and Soil Science at the 100 level or above are required, to be selected in the student's area of interest and approved by his or her advisor. Courses in related areas may be substituted for one or two of these 6 courses with the consent of the student's advisor.

The overall mission of the College of Arts and Sciences is to provide the highest possible caliber of undergraduate general education in the liberal arts and sciences. This ranges from the utilization of intellectual 57 58 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES tools and skills (articulative, quantitative, scientific and creative) to the theoretical exploration of man and his natural, social and cultural en\u00ad vironment. It is accomplished through critical analysis, which the educated mind is trained to bring to bear upon that environment and interrelationships among elements of the environment throughout the student's years on campus and thereafter. The core missions are: To provide opportunities for undergraduates to concentrate in specific disciplinary approaches (i.e., major), which may lead to pre-professional preparation, graduate studies, general education as a citizen who con\u00ad tributes to rather than draws upon the society, or a combination of these. To provide through distribution requirements an awareness of how the diverse intellectual, cultural and creative aspects of the liberal arts and sciences approach the study of man and his environment: The humanities, through the study of the great individual creative geniuses of mankind, past and present, in literature, the arts and philosophy. The performing arts, by providing opportunities for self expression through active participation in fields such as music, art, theatre and creative writing. The social sciences, through their focus upon the human experience and behavior, individual and collective, via the application of analytical methods and their concern with the human species and its relationships with the various environments evolved through time, and with the diver\u00ad sity of the human conditions at any time. The natural sciences, through an understanding of the order of nature, the organization of the universe from the microcosm to the macrocosm, their relationship to man and his powers of observation, imagination, ratiocination and consequent understanding and appreciation of the scope, logic, precision and limitations of scientific methods, principles and challenges. Further, to provide graduate training in selected areas in which local, regional or national needs coincide with and complement strengths of particular undergraduate departments or programs, as well as in selected areas where our position as an institution of higher learning benefits intellectually and educationally from the presence of more specialized, rigorous and advanced study for the further development of the edu\u00ad cated mind. To carry out quality scholarly activity and research as a continuing contribution to the world's knowledge and understanding of humanity and the universe. As a necessary prerequisite to the maintenance of the intellectual competence required of a faculty providing quality education in a college of a true university, we strive to provide an environment for mutual intellectual stimulation, curiosity, and growth. It must be emphasized that the integrity of the whole College effort THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 59 requires the continued emphasis on the excellence of each of the missions above. The Liberal Arts and Sciences Curricula The curricula in liberal arts and sciences, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Music, offer instruction in language, literature, philosophy, religion, the fine arts, the social sciences, the physical and biological sciences and mathematics. Every candidate for the Bachelor of Arts degree must fulfill the re\u00ad quirements described in sections I and II below, and present a total of 122 semester hours of credit, including 2 semester hours of required courses in physical education. At least 75 of the minimum 122 credit hours must be in subj ects outside the major discipline. Every candidate for the Bachelor of Science degree must fulfill the requirements described in sections III and IV below, and present a total of 122 semester hours of credit including 2 semester hours of required courses in physical education. Every candidate for the Bachelor of Music degree must fulfill the requirements described in sections I and V below, and present a total of 123 or 122 semester hours of credit (as described in section V below), including 2 semester hours of required courses in physical education. The Studies Committee of the College will rule upon petitions for exceptions to the College regulations. The College expects entering students to be able to write correct, clear and effective English, and no student unable to do shall obtain the B.A., the B.M., or the B.S. degree. A minimum cumulative quality point average of 2.0 is required for graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences. Courses taken on a pass/no pass basis may not include any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree, or any taken to fulfill distribution requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. All exceptions to degree and/or major requirements must be approved by the Studies Committee. In addition to the two semesters of physical education required of all students by the University, the following distribution requirements must be met: Each student shall present nine semester courses (3 credits, or more each) by choosing three courses from each of any three of the following categories: I. REQUIRED FOR ALL B.A. STUDENTS A. LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE *Chinese English French German Greek Hebrew Italian Latin Russian Spanish Literature in translation Intermediate level or above. 60 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES No more than two of the three required courses may be chosen from any one discipline. Students may not fulfill the requirement without offering a foreign language, at the intermediate level or above. B. FINE ARTS AND PHILOSOPHY Art Music Philosophy Theatre Communication Religion No more than two of the three required courses may be chosen from any one discipline. C. SOCIAL SCIENCES Anthropology History Economics Political Science Geography Psychology Sociology No more than two of the three required courses may be chosen from any one discipline. D. SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS Biology Geology Botany Physics Chemistry Zoology Mathematics No more than two of the three required courses may be chosen from any one discipline. (Biology, botany and zoology are considered one discipline) Note: Linguistics 101, 102 may be considered as meeting the distribution requirements of category A or B or C at the student's option. Greek 32 may be considered as meeting the distribution requirements of Category A or B at the student's option. In no case may the requirements of Cate\u00ad gory A be satisfied without offering a foreign language at the intermediate level or above. MAJOR FIELD Each student, in consultation with an appropriate faculty adviser from his or her prospective major department, must choose a major field by the enrollment period for the junior year. The specific courses making up the field, as well as the student's entire program for the last two years, are chosen in consultation with the chairman of the department in which the major part of the work is to be taken and must have his approval. The following minimal requirements must be met. 1. The field must be a well integrated whole, adapted to the student's special interest. 2. It must include a minimum of 36 semester hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. Concentration requirements, including courses and necessary prerequisites may not exceed 60 semester hours, not more than 451 of which may be required in the major discipline. Transfer students will be expected to complete as matriculated students in the College of Arts and Sciences at least one-half of the courses that are required in their major discipline. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 61 3. Courses taken to fulfill distribution requirements may also be counted toward the major credit requirements. 4. All students are required to obtain an average grade of C in all courses required for their major. INDIVIDUAL DESIGN MAJOR For those students whose needs and interests are not met by the major programs currently offered in the College, there exists the option for the student to initiate a non-departmental major chosen from among the various offerings in the College and tailored to their individual needs. The program must be sponsored by a faculty member and approved by the College Honors and Individual Studies Committee and pre\u00ad sented in the student's sophomore year. MULTIPLE MAJORS Students may elect more than one major by consult\u00ad ing the Dean's Office, College of Arts and Sciences and the departments involved. In order to multiple major, a student must satisfactorily complete the major requirements of each department involved. DATE OF EFFECTIVENESS OF DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The catalogue that determines the requirements for students is the catalogue in effect at the time the student enters the College of Arts and Sciences. Should requirements for the degree or the major be changed after a student is admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences, the student would have the option of fulfilling all of the old regulations or all of the new regulations. II. SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS FOR B.A. MAJORS ANTHROPOLOGY Anthropology 21 and two of the following three: 24, 26, 50. In addition, Anthropology 225 (normally in the senior year), 228, and four other advanced courses. Every student must take at least three courses in other disciplines related to anthropology. Consult the Department on this last point. AREA AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Entering students are invited to consider the option of concentrating in Area & International Studies. Courses in several academic disciplines can be combined so as to focus on a particular area of the world, thus providing an opportunity to test generalizations against the particular reality of a geographical area and its people. Undergraduates who major in Area Studies usually accumulate sufficient credit to enable them to also fulfill department requirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. The five areas presently available for concentration are : ASIA, CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, RUSSIA/EAST EUROPE, EUROPE (Western, Northern, Mediterranean). This relatively novel method of undergraduate education combines exposure to the traditional disciplines with integrative knowledge and appreciation of a foreign culture and thus combines the broad liberal arts education with a more specific area competence. Students who plan on majoring in Area Studies should take during their freshman and/or sophomore years the required foreign language courses of the selected area as well as such beginning courses in the social sciences and human\u00ad ities which are prerequisites of subsequent required courses and do also meet the general distribution requirements. 1 At least 75 of the minimum 122 credit hours required for a Bachelor of Arts degree must be in subjects outside the major discipline. (See preceding page.) 62 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Students interested in concentrating in Area Studies are urged to contact Professor Douglas Kinnard, Director, Area & International Studies, Extension 4062. Specific requirements of the individual programs are as follows: ASIAN STUDIES Asian area studies majors will concentrate on one of three major geographic areas in Asia \u2014 West Asia (the Middle East); South and Southeast Asia; and East Asia (China and Japan). Special arrangements can be made for students wishing to concentrate on studies of Central Asia. Courses relating specifically to the three areas are listed below. In addition \"Readings and Research\" courses (numbered 197, 198) are regularly offered to students at an advanced level; and \"Special Topics\" courses (numbered 195, 196, 295) on Asian areas are occasionally offered by various departments and may be taken to fulfill the major requirements. There are also courses such as Economics 216, \"Economic Development,\" and Economics 258, \"Problems of Communism,\" which cut across geographic lines and may be applicable to the students' program. The Asian Area Studies major will choose an adviser from the faculty in the area of his particular interest, and work out a program with him. WESTERN ASIA I.

Many students will desire so to direct their four-year undergraduate courses as to provide, in addition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofessional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 71 Special advising is available in the College for students preparing for careers in education, journalism, law, and medical sciences. BIOLOGY A major in Biology is offered to students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. It has been designed for the student who wishes to con\u00ad centrate in Biology while pursuing a liberal arts education. It will also serve as a basis for programs leading to graduate study in biological fields and as an appropriate major for students in premedical and predental programs. The concentration consists of a year of elementary biology and single-semester courses in genetics, ecology, cellular biology, animal structure and function, and plant structure and development. This core is followed by three elective courses selected from a wide range of offerings in biologically oriented departments at the University. A year of chemistry, a year of physics, and mathematics (calculus or statistics) are also required. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journalism is generally open to academically qualified students who hold the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in any discipline. Interested students should take a broad program in the liberal arts, including work in the social sciences, in mass communication, and in English. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year college with a Bachelor's degree prior to admission. There is no prescribed curriculum which is requisite for admission, but the student is advised to develop a command of the English language as well as a comprehension of American politics, social, and economic institutions. For further details, kindly consult Professor L. J. Gould, Department of Political Science. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequisite for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as preparation for such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantially from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy and religion, psychology, and social studies. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and zoology with a minimum of two years of college work. PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (page 27) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year program with two years of preprofessional work which includes English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, a course in fine arts, and orientation to pharmacy. MEDICINE AND DENTISTR Y The prevailing requirements for admission to an accredited medical college include a minimum of three years of under\u00ad graduate work but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that a student desiring to enter medical college should during his sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which he expects to apply, and arrange to include in his program courses required by those schools. Each student, in consultation with his adviser, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum requirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: 72 THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Mathematics, one of the following options: a) Mathematics 21,22 (recommended for able students) b) Mathematics 19,20 (recommended) c) Mathematics 21 (adequate) d) Mathematics 9, 11 (adequate) e) Mathematics 9, 2; 21 or 19, 20 (suggested for students not immediately prepared to enter calculus) f) Mathematics 7, 8 (not acceptable) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1-2 or 11-12 (recommended for potential Chemistry majors) Chemistry 131,132 (required) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory Physics 15, 16 or 24, 25 (recommended for students concentrating in the physical sciences or engineering) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1,2 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least two years of college work. In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in planning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. A student should consult catalogues of the dental colleges to which he expects to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. In general, students should avoid taking courses at the undergraduate level in those areas taught at the professional level: i.e., human anatomy, human physiol\u00ad ogy, microbiology, biochemistry. Many medical colleges now strongly recom\u00ad mend or require that students enroll in courses in the humanities and social sciences. SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon application to the Dean of Education, be accepted into the teacher training program for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, up to 24 credit hours including student teaching, can count as electives towards the Bachelor of Arts. Students completing this program are eligible for Secondary Teacher's Certification. College Honors The honors program at both the junior and senior level is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special project without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a student enters a program of reading, research, or creation under the direction of the department of his choice. A student may take honors in either or both years. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences who, at the end of his junior year, has an average of 3.00 or above for the work of the sophomore and junior years may become an applicant for college honors in a particular subject. His program for the senior year must be approved not later than the end of the junior year by the department in which honors are sought and by the Committee on Honors, and he must present a satisfactory written report and pass an oral examination on the field of special study. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 73 A program called junior honors, which may be considered introductory to but distinct from college honors, is available to juniors who have a sophomore average of 3.00 or above and who have the permission of their department chair\u00ad men. The program for each junior honors candidate will be determined by the department concerned. Departmental Honors A senior whose overall average is 2.50 or above, or who has been specially recommended by the department in which he is concentrating, is eligible to take a comprehensive examination. Upon successfully completing the examination he will be granted his degree \"with Departmental Honors.\" Some departments have instituted seminars or other programs designed to help the student gain the requisite breadth and depth of knowledge. The Center for Area Studies The Center for Area and International Studies is an inter-department activity, with a Director and five programs, each of which has its own Director.

Students are responsible for obtaining specific information regarding degree requirements and teacher certification from the appropriate College of Education and Social Services office. FIFTH-YEAR CERTIFICATE IN EDUCATION A special fifth-year program culminating in a certificate of advanced study is offered for students who wish to work beyond the bacehlor's degree but who THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES 87 need or desire more flexibility than is possible in any of the standard programs for master's degrees. The certificate program is especially designed to meet the needs of teachers who are developing new teaching fields, for advanced students who are meeting requirements for state certification, and for experienced teachers who desire flexibility in choice of courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Each certificate program is individualized to fit the qualifications and the professional objectives of the candidate. Undergraduate courses may be approved for the program when such courses appropriately support the candidate's professional objectives. The program for the Fifth-Year Certificate is governed by the following reg\u00ad ulations: (1) Candidates must hold a bachelor's degree. (2) Candidates must make written application on forms obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Education and Social Services. (3) Candidates are admitted to the program by action of a faculty committee. (4) A maximum of twelve credits may be applied to the program at the time of admission. (5) A maximum of nine credits may be transferred from other institutions. (6) Credits for the program may be earned in the regular academic year, the Summer Session, and the Evening Division. (7) The program for each candidate must include a minimum of thirty credits approved by a faculty adviser. (8) A minimum mark of C must be made in any course which is to be included in the program. (9) No comprehensive examination or formal thesis is required for completion of the program, but the candidate will submit a culminating paper under the direction of his faculty adviser. (10) The program must be completed within seven years after the time of admission. Requests for further information about fifth-year programs should be di\u00ad rected to the College of Education & Social Services Student Personnel Services Center, 306 Waterman Building. CERTIFICATE OF ADVANCED STUDY A Certificate of Advanced Study (sixth year certificate), a 30-36 graduate credit hour program beyond the Master's Degree, is offered by the College of Education and Social Services in the field of Administration and Planning and Counseling. The C.A.S. has become a professional requirement in the hiring and advancement of administrative, supervisory, and other personnel in many school districts throughout the United States and since 1965 has been a prerequisite for membership in the American Association of School Administrators (AASA). The program requires a nine credit on-campus residency unit which must include a three credit hour laboratory experience. Residency may be fulfilled during any academic semester or summer and is part of the total 30-36 program credits. Further information may be obtained from the College of Education and Social Services. INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION FIELD STUDY The College of Education and Social Services now offers a comparative educa\u00ad tion field experience in England and has plans to develop programs in other parts of the world. 88 THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES The purpose of these programs is two-fold: 1) to provide an in-depth experi\u00ad ence in the educational system of another country; and 2) to give the students an opportunity to live in a society different from their own. Traveling abroad has a number of advantages. First, it broadens the outlook of the person involved in the experience whether it be social, educational, or politi\u00ad cal. Second, it affords one an opportunity to observe people in their indigenous environment. Third, it allows for an exchange of ideas and philosophies. Finally, it adds a new dimension to one's life in being able to share one's thoughts and feelings with others of a different culture. Specifically, the field experience in England is designed primarily to offer students something more than the usual \"study abroad\" program. In addition to the usual visits to places of local cultural interest, this program offers an opportunity for each student to relate his professional needs, interests, goals and aspirations to a specific educational area. Students will have the opportunity to visit many areas of cultural and personal interest but, in addition, will live with a family in the host country and work as a paraprofessional in one or more of the host nation's schools.

The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administra\u00ad tion includes the Departments of Business Administration, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics and the programs in Computer Science and Statistics. The College offers professional curricula in the following general areas: (1) business administration and management science (2) engineering and applied science (3) mathematical sciences The specific programs and degrees offered are: Business Administration B.S. in Business Administration Civil Engineering B.S. in Civil Engineering Computer Science B.S. in Computer Science Electrical Engineering B.S. in Electrical Engineering Manufacturing and Management B.S. in Manufacturing and Engineering Management Engineering Mathematics \u2014 EMBA B.S. in Mathematics Mechanical Engineering B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Physics \u2014 EMBA B.S. in Physics Professional Chemistry B.S. in Chemistry Professional Geology B.S. in Geology Statistics B.S. in Mathematics B.S. Degree in Engineering B.S. in Engineering B.S. Degree \u2014 Undesignated Major B.S. These programs provide a basis both for professional practice and for graduate study in the fields indicated. In addition, they offer excellent preparation for advanced professional study, in such areas as business, law, and medicine. Details are given in the sections which follow. Professional Education Graduates of professional schools are expected to fulfill unique and significant roles in planning and directing the work of the world and in effecting and managing change. The primary objective of professional education is, therefore, to develop skill in the \"problem solving art.\" This includes not only intellectual knowledge of complex and high order, but also the intelligent and intuitive application of that knowledge to the situations of life. Professional graduates must have the ability, the confidence, and the self-discipline to identify and define a problem, break it down into operable components, marshal the necessary resources from the natural 89 90 THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION and social sciences, mathematics and the humanities, and to employ these resources in a systematic, effective, and efficient fashion to derive a useful solution. To enhance and promote these qualities in students, the College's curricula all emphasize the balanced development of conceptual understanding and specific skills. The professional graduate is also often required to act on the basis of incomplete knowledge and with limited time and resources. The College therefore requires that its students exhibit certain personal qualities in addition to the intellectual achievement expected of all uni\u00ad versity graduates. Foremost among these are integrity, acceptance of responsibility, and reliability in independent work. The College is also committed to the idea that learning is a life-long endeavor. Our undergraduate programs therefore provide a base upon which students may build as the demands of their professional careers increase and their personal interests broaden. General Requirements and Academic Regulations DIVISIONS All undergraduate programs in the College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration are divided into lower and upper divisions. The lower division comprises the first two (freshman-sophomore) and the upper division the last two (junior-senior) years. Each upper division curriculum is administered by one of the College's departments or programs or by an affiliated department elsewhere in the University. Students who wish to complete one of the upper division programs must apply for admission to that program during the spring semester of their sophomore year (or after completing 45 credits and prior to the completion of 60 credits). In order to be admitted to an upper division program, applicants must: (a) be in good academic standing in the lower division of the College or in another college of the University. Where appropriate, applicants for trans\u00ad fer from colleges outside UVM will be considered for admission to the upper division simultaneously with consideration of their application for admission to the University. (b) meet specific requirements established by the department or program responsible for the upper division curriculum to which they seek admission. These requirements may include (1) the completion of specific prerequisite courses, and (2) a grade-point average in these prerequisite courses higher than the minimum required to remain in good academic standing. HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL STUDIES The objective of the requirements in humanities and social studies for all programs is to broaden the student's understanding of man and the relation\u00ad ships in human society. Each Freshman student should, in consultation with his advisor, make a pre\u00ad liminary plan of an integrated sequence of courses based on his own interest. The sequence should constitute a continuing program extending through at least three undergraduate years. At the end of the first year the student will declare his THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 91 elective area of concentration and, in consultation with his advisor, will prepare a plan of an integrated sequence of courses. A minimum of nine credit hours -is required in the elective area of concentration. ELECTIVE AREAS 1. Language 2. Literature 2. Fine Arts 4. Philosophy 5. Social Sciences No credit is given for a \"dash course\" unless the second semester is completed. Credit for elementary language courses is granted for degrees in the College only if the intermediate level course is also satisfactorily completed. The College has a minimum requirement of 18 credit hours of humanities and social studies courses for the B.S. degree but specific programs may require more than this minimum. PHYSICAL EDUCATION In addition to the course requirements listed for each curriculum, all students must satisfactorily complete two credits in physical education. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES Freshmen who wish to concentrate in environmental studies in EMBA, must enroll in the engineering core curriculum. See Page 95. CREDIT FOR MILITARY STUDIES COURSES Military Studies 1, 2, 11 and 12 are approved in the category of humanistic social studies for all programs in the College. The College Studies Committee acts on petitions for credit for other Military Studies courses, which may be utilized as free electives only. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration does not, in general, grant credit for Military Service. Credit for specific courses or other academic experience acquired during Military Service may be available through petition to the Studies Committee. TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credits from other institutions are not used in the calculations of the University of Vermont grade-point average (GPA). Students who wish transfer credit must obtain approval from their departments. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students who receive a cumulative or semester GPA (grade-point average) of less than 2.0 will be placed on trial. Students who have failed half their course credits for any semester, or who have had two successive semesters with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA, are eligible to be dismissed. Business Administration The Department of Business Administration offers a program leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. The curriculum is designed to provide the student with a broad background in the fields of knowl\u00ad92 THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION edge useful for managerial decision making and additionally considerable exposure to the Humanities and the Social, Physical and Mathematical Sciences. The core program required of all students provides: A. A background of the concepts, processes, and institutions in marketing and distribution, production, and financing functions of business enterprise. B. A background of the economic and legal environment of business enterprise along with consideration of the social and political influences on business. C. A basic understanding of the concepts and methods of accounting, quantita\u00ad tive methods, and information systems. D.A study of organization theory, interpersonal relationships, control and motivation systems, and communications. E. A study of administrative processes under conditions of uncertainty including integrating analysis and policy determination at the overall management level. Beyond this core, study in a specialty option allows the student to pursue in more depth a functional area of interest to him. The areas available are Account\u00ad ing, Finance, and Banking, Marketing Management and Sales Promotion, and Management. The Department of Business Administration cooperates with the Department of Mechanical Engineering in offering courses in the Management Engineering Curriculum. This curriculum is administered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and is described in the section on engineering curricula. The Accounting option is registered with the University of the State of New York, The State Education Department, Albany, N.Y. Students completing the requirements of the accounting option will be eligible for admission to the New York State licensing examination in Certified Public Accountancy. A minimum of 122 approved semester hours is required for the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, including required courses in physical education. Distribution Requirements 1.

Engineering education at UVM combines the study of mathematics and the physical and engineering sciences with courses illustrating their application to the analysis and design of equipment, processes, and complete systems. In addition, students are encouraged to avail themselves generously of the life science, social science, and humanities courses available throughout the Univer\u00ad sity. The breadth and flexibility of the engineering programs provide a sound background for engineering practices in private or public domains, for graduate study in engineering or science, and for further professional study in such fields as business, law, or medicine. THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 95 The required courses in each curriculum are normally arranged for a four-year program. These courses may be arranged in a five-year sequence if desired. Also the course can be arranged to accommodate transfer from other curricula. Departments may require students to visit Northeastern industrial centers during their junior year. The expense for the trip of several days is borne by the student. Students enrolled in the civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering curricula may become affiliated with their respective national professional engineering societies, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, as each organization has authorized a student chapter at the University of Vermont. Engineering students demonstrating high scholarship attainment combined with exemplary character are recognized by membership in the Vermont Alpha Chap\u00ad ter of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society.These student organi\u00ad zations' meetings present opportunities for students to conduct activities similar to those of the national societies. These include: technical papers presented by students and engineers actively engaged in their profession; attendance at con\u00ad ventions; and inspection trips. These provide helpful contacts with engineering practice and assist in the development of leadership qualities essential to success in the engineering profession. The curricula in civil, electrical, mechanical, and manufacturing and manage\u00ad ment engineering are accredited by the Engineers' Council for Professional Development.

It is the study of the theoretical basis, design and application of electronic computing machines. The program in Computer Science is a new administrative unit at the Univer\u00ad sity. A student interested in majoring in computer science will have a faculty member from the Computer Science Program assigned as advisor. The program offers the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science. The Computer Science curriculum provides a broad basic training in Computer Science with required courses in the theory of computing, hardware design and software techniques. A minor specialization in an allied field is required so that the student develops an appreciation for the applicability of his knowledge of computer science. Requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science are, in addition to the mathematical sciences core (page 104): Computer Science: CS 12, 101, 102, 103, 104, 201, 222, 241, 242 Other Mathematical Science: Math 104,124; Stat 151 Electrical Engineering: EE 230 Other: English 1, Communications and Theatre 11, one full year of physics or electrical engineering.

Statistics is a mathematical science extensively used in a wide variety of fields. Indeed, every discipline which gathers and uses data has developed a need for statistical procedures to understand and use the information implicit in their data base. Statisticians become involved in efforts to solve real world problems by developing and investigating stochastic models, designing experimental plans, constructing and interpreting descriptive statistics, and developing and applying statistical inference procedures. Statisticians.need a knowledge of mathematics and computer programming to develop new techniques and investigate their properties as well as to carry out the calculations required in the process of summarizing and analyzing data. The Statistics program is an independent unit within the College of Engineer\u00ad ing, Mathematics and Business Administration with the responsibility of offering to the entire University community appropriate probability and statis\u00ad tics courses as well as degree programs in statistics. The Program staff consists of faculty with extensive training and continuing professional interest in statis\u00ad tics and holding appointments in a number of different departments (Mathe\u00ad matics, Business Administration, Economics, Psychology, Forestry, Physiology, and Epidemiology and Environmental Health). The newly proposed B.S. in Statistics program is currently under considera\u00ad tion by the University. The curriculum would provide a basic training in probability, statistical theory and applied statistics. During the junior year the student and his/her advisor will formulate the detailed program of advanced courses appropriate for the student's career objectives. Program options are available for three different career goals: 1) employment as a bachelor level statistician in business, industry, or government; 2) graduate level training in statistics, biostatistics, operations research, or some closely allied field; and 3) graduate level training in another field which makes extensive use of proba\u00ad bility and statistics such as psychology, business and economics, agricultural science, and the medical sciences. Appropriate courses for the student's intended career goals are selected under the professional electives section of the curriculum. Students interested in majoring in statistics should contact the Statistics Program Director for details on curriculum requirements. Required courses for the first two years are essentially identical to that for a mathematics major. Additionally Statistics 51 and 141 are recommended. The College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration offers cooperative work-study programs for majors in several departments within the College. These cooperative programs differ from those offered at STATISTICS Cooperative Programs THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 109 many other institutions in that they do not begin until the junior year has been completed. Furthermore, all such arrangements are considered to be honors programs, with selection determined by the department concerned and enroll\u00ad ment limited to available opportunities in industries, companies and state and federal agencies. The cooperative program attempts to provide a year of practical work experience related to a student's major field, to give students a chance to earn toward senior year college expenses, and to make the placement of a student after graduation somewhat easier by having had a year of work experience. No academic credit will be given for the work experience but an entry will be made upon the official transcript indicating the student had been a cooperative student, and the dates of employment and the name of the employer. The calendar for work experience has two options: (1) Normally, the full year of work occurs between the end of the junior year and the beginning of the senior year. (2) Some federal agencies require two work experiences separated by a semes\u00ad ter of college work. In this case, the first work experience occurs during the summer after the junior year, followed by the first semester of senior year at the University of Vermont. The second work experience of either a full year or a half year is followed by the last semester of college work. The Division of Health Sciences The Division of Health Sciences, authorized by the Board of Trustees, became effective July 1, 1968, bringing together several related programs in this important field. It includes the College of Medicine, the School of Allied Health Sciences, and the School of Nursing. The Division reserves the right to require the withdrawal of any student from any curricula whose health, academic record or performance and behavior in the professional careers is judged unsatisfactory. The College of Medicine REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION Applicants to The University of Vermont College of Medicine are expected to complete the required courses of study by July 1 preceding the September admission date \u2014 in a college or university accredited by the National Committee of Regional Accrediting Agencies of the United States. Required are one year each of the following college level courses: Biology Physics (including laboratory) General or inorganic chemistry Organic chemistry In addition, because a physician requires a broad and balanced cultural background as well as a technical education, the College recommends as appropriate to an adequate premedical program: English \u2014 at least one and preferably two years of composition and or literature. Mathematics \u2014 dependent upon secondary school preparation but should include at least an introduction to calculus. Behavioral Sciences \u2014 one or two years in the areas of psychology, sociology or anthropology. The Humanities \u2014 at least two years of course work in history, phil\u00ad osophy, religion or the arts. The College of Medicine encourages its prospective students to con\u00ad centrate while in college in a field of knowledge of their choice, whether in the sciences or humanities, and to pursue these interests in depth. It seeks students with diverse collegiate and extra-collegiate backgrounds, but insists that their pattern of performance has demonstrated intel\u00ad lectual drive, independent thinking, curiosity and discipline. Since communication, written and verbal, is so essential in scientific and clinical medicine, the faculty of the College of Medicine fully expects applicants to have mastered basic skills in the use of the English lan\u00ad guage, i.e., proficiency in grammar, spelling, organization, etc. 110 THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES 111 Eligibility of an applicant for admission is determined by the Com\u00ad mittee on Admissions of the College of Medicine on the basis of the fol\u00ad lowing criteria: A. The prior scholastic record of the applicant. B. Aptitude for the study and practice of medicine as determined from the applicant's autobiographical statements, letters of evaluation and by personal interview with members of the Committee. C. Behavioral qualities deemed essential for a career in medicine. These include, but are not limited to, judgment, personal insight and perception, personal integrity, personal accountability, respon\u00ad sibility and sensitivity. D. The applicant's scores on the Medical College Admissions Test. The Committee strives to select as students those applicants who will benefit most from the College's specific educational program. Within the selection process, the needs of society are considered in addition to those of the individual applicant. Preference for admission is according to the following priorities: A. Residents of Vermont. B. Residents of other states having contractual arrangements with the College of Medicine. C. Residents of all other states. D. In order to further the interest of the State of Vermont in retaining physicians to practice medicine and deliver health care to its citizens, preference will be given in \"A\" above to those applicants having the greater duration of residency within the State. E. Sons and daughters of alumni of the College of Medicine will be given special consideration within the framework of the above policy. The final closure date for receiving applicants is November 1 preced\u00ad ing the September admission. An application fee of $20.00 (not refundable) is payable on request of the Office of Admissions. THE CURRICULUM The curriculum consists of three parts: the basic science core, the clinical core, and the senior major program. Basic Science Core The forty-eight weeks of instruction in the Basic Science Core spans the first year and fall semester of the second year. During this period students are in\u00ad structed in the basic sciences that undergird clinical medicine. Emphasis is placed on that body of knowledge common to all types of medical practice, avoiding the minute details relevant only to individual specialties. Seminars in Human Behavior and the Basic Clerkship provide for the first year medical student clini\u00ad cal contacts, an awareness of social, cultural and psychologic factors affecting health and illness, and insight into the major issues influencing the practice of medicine. 112 THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES Clinical Science Core The Clinical Core extends from January of the second year until December of the third year. During this twelve-month period each student receives twelve weeks of instruction in medicine, twelve weeks of instruction in surgery, eight weeks in pediatrics, eight weeks in obstetrics and gynecology, and eight weeks in psychiatry. There will be a brief summer vacation. During this year the student works under the supervision of a physician within the wards and clinics of the Medical Center Hospital in providing primary care to patients. Senior Major Program The final portion of the curriculum, the Senior Major Program, extends through the final one and one-half years prior to graduation. This period is divided into sixteen rotations of one month duration. The major program enables each student to select that course of study best suited to his career objectives. Majors are offered in each of the preclinical sciences, plus medicine, family practice, surgery and its subspecialties, obstetrics \u2014 gynecology, pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation medicine. An integral part of each clinical major includes a number of required clinical and laboratory experiences as well as elective rotations. These elective rotations are not restricted to the disciplines in which the student is majoring and may include approved learning experiences away from Burlington. Many students see this as an opportunity to work and study in a large urban setting, at another medical school or a foreign medical center. Students should anticipate spending variable periods of time away from Burlington in the course of pursuing their required training. A system of faculty advisors has been developed to counsel each student on a one-to-one basis throughout the planning and course of this major program and in anticipation of later graduate education. Although the majority of students elect to pursue a clinical major, students so desiring may commit their entire major program to study in one of the preclinical sciences. While these programs are individualized, it is expected that graduate study and research will form the basis for each. Qualified students may simultaneously enroll in the Graduate College of the University as candidates for the Master of Science degree while fulfilling the requirements for the M.D. degree within the College of Medicine. The School of Allied Health Sciences Dental Hygiene Associate in Science Medical Technology Bachelor of Science Medical Laboratory Technology Associate in Science Physical Therapy Bachelor of Science Radiologic Technology Associate in Science The School of Allied Health Sciences offers a variety of programs in response to the social and health care needs of our community. It encourages interaction among its students and faculty for closer participation in meeting this need. All programs offer clinical education experiences in a variety of appropriately ap\u00ad proved hospitals and health facilities in Vermont and the eastern part of the country. The academic programs are accredited by the responsible professional agencies. THE PROGRAM IN DENTAL HYGIENE The Department of Dental Hygiene offers a two-year curriculum leading to an Associate in Science degree and a Certificate in Dental Hygiene. THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES 113 The program is accredited by the Council on Dental Education of the Ameri\u00ad can Dental Association. Graduates are eligible to write the National Board Examination in Dental Hygiene and meet requirements for licensure determined by individual states. The duties of a graduate dental hygienist are educational and preventive in nature and may be carried out in private dental practice, public institutions, hospitals and industrial clinics, and public health programs. Dental hygienists practice under the supervision of a dentist. The primary concentration of her skills is in oral health education, oral prophylaxis and inspection. However, she is qualified to perform procedures for the prevention of dental caries, expose and process dental radiographs, and assist in other phases of dental practice. The dental hygienist is a vital member of the health science professions, and her opportunities are practically unlimited. Requirements for admission to study in the Dental Hygiene Program are identical with general University requirements, with the additional requirement that applicants write the Dental Hygiene Aptitude Test. Information and appli\u00ad cation forms for this test are available from the American Dental Hygienist's Association, 211 East Chicago Ave., Chicago, 111. 60611. Applicants are encouraged to have a personal interview, preferably after their application is completed. As this program of study is scientifically orientated, high school courses in algebra, chemistry, biology and physics are important prerequisites. Personal attributes essential to success in this program include good health, emotional stability, task orientation, high moral standards and an ability to relate well with society. The courses of study are designed to give the student a well rounded founda\u00ad tion in basic sciences, specific knowledge in dental sciences and an understanding of the humanities. Clinical experience is obtained in the department's dental hygiene clinic where patients of all ages and with varieties of problems receive service, and in community oral health care situations.

Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Environmental Studies \u2014 Home Economics Environmental Studies \u2014 Natural Resources The Environmental Program is a University-wide program of under\u00ad graduate education, research, and community service dedicated to the study of the cultural and biophysical environments essential to the quality of life on earth. It seeks to serve the needs of students for sound education and career preparation and the needs of society \u2014 two goals that strengthen one another in practice. The Environmental Program is an interdisciplinary venture involving students and faculty from throughout the University, as well as com\u00ad munity professionals, recognizing that study of the environment involves all disciplines and professional fields. Thus, the Program is not a unit of any single college or school of the University, but works cooperatively with a wide range of academic programs and action organizations on campus and in the community. While the Environmental Program attempts to serve a wide array of environmental interests, its primary focus is the individual student. A Director and interdisciplinary faculty assist students in planning an in\u00ad dividualized program of studies which combines a broad, comprehen\u00ad sive understanding of the environment and depth in a specific discipline or profession leading to a future career. Program offices are located in The Bittersweet where students are invited to visit with the staff regard\u00ad ing their academic plans, to gain assistance with research or action projects, and to seek information about community internships and future employment. The Environmental Studies curriculum The curriculum in Environmental Studies offers students several alternatives leading to an individualized program of studies: The Coordinate Major in En\u00ad vironmental Studies combines study of the environment with a traditional disci\u00ad plinary major or professional field. The Major in Environmental Studies provides a unique opportunity for the student seeking an individually-designed interdisciplinary major. Students entering the University may apply for admission to Environmental Studies through several of the undergraduate colleges and professional schools. Choice of the appropriate college or school will depend on the individual's interests and educational objectives or, in the case of the Coordinate Major program, on the major or professional field to be coordinated with Environ\u00ad 131 132 THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM mental Studies. It is recommended that incoming students consult with the Director of The Environmental Program before making' application to the University. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Students must complete the distribution requirements and minimum credit- hour requirements of their College or School, and one of the following Major Programs. Incoming students will be assigned an advisor in The Environmental Program who will assist the student in selecting a major program during the sophomore year. COORDINATE MAJOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES For the majority of students this program offers the best combination of career oppor\u00ad tunities and environmental interests. In addition to the Environmental Studies Core Program, the student completes the departmental requirements of a related disciplinary or professional major in his or her college or school, and an indi\u00ad vidualized program of studies and independent work which strengthens the environmental aspects of the major.

Each student's program is individually-designed, rather than shaped around an existing departmental major. While this major is less struc\u00ad tured than the Coordinate Major, it provides the opportunity to direct study toward newly-developing environmental careers and graduate study programs. It is especially suited to the student seeking a broad liberal education with an environmental thrust. Admission to this major requires approval of The Environmental Program and successful completion of Environmental Studies 51. In addition to course requirements, the major includes a required senior research thesis, internship, or substantial independent project.

Such 138 THE GRADUATE COLLEGE persons, therefore, are working toward an M.D. and M.S. or Ph.D., but com\u00ad pletion of each degree may occur at a different time. All courses for which graduate credit is received at UVM in a master's degree program, whether a master's degree is received or not, may be applied toward a Ph.D. at UVM provided they are appropriate for the Ph.D. program. No provision is made for a person to employ the same credit to satisfy two master's degrees at the Universi ty of Vermont. Continuing Education Through Continuing Education the University provides opportuni\u00ad ties for formal and informal study to persons who have not attended college, who require additional training in their work, or who wish to pursue previously unexplored areas of study. The Summer Session Summer Session offers courses in many subjects at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The offerings are diversified to meet the needs of those who desire courses leading to a bachelor's degree; those who wish to do graduate work; principals and superintendents of schools who desire fundamental or specialized courses in the fields of educational administration and supervision; teachers in elementary or secondary schools who seek credit toward state teachers' certificates, or who desire to broaden their knowledge of special subjects; persons who desire college level courses for self-improvement. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont obtain prior approval from his academic dean for any courses to be taken in the Summer Session. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. The master's degree in several, but not all, areas may be earned through work in the Summer Session. Enrollment in courses for graduate credit does not imply admission to the Graduate College. Details about available courses and pro\u00ad grams will be sent on request by the Director of Continuing Education. Evening Division The University's Evening Division program provides educational opportuni\u00ad ties for adults. Members of the faculty at the University, and others working under temporary appointment, offer evening or extension courses in many disciplines both at the Burlington Campus and at locations throughout Vermont. Many courses may be taken for credit but some are non-credit courses designed for the adult who is interested in continuing his education for pleasure or self- improvement. Courses are given in towns and cities throughout the state wherever a group of ten or more individuals register for a course. Arrangements for Evening Division courses are made through the Evening Division, Grasse Mount. Length of courses varies from ten to fifteen weeks. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont obtain prior approval from his academic dean for any courses to be taken in the Evening Division. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. All persons desiring graduate credit must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. Non-Degree Student Enrollment Non-degree students are persons who have presented minimum credentials and are permitted to undertake limited course work in the day program for 139 140 CONTINUING EDUCATION purposes other than that of earning a degree. Credits earned by non-degree students who later apply and gain admission to a degree program will be evaluated and, if appropriate, will be accepted toward completion of their degree. Non- degree students may enroll for a maximum of 6 credits (or two courses) per semester in the day program; additional courses may be enrolled for only with permission from the appropriate Academic Dean. Undergraduate non-degree students may not exceed a total accumulation of 30 semester credit hours without special permission from the Dean of the college involved. Graduate students are limited to a total accumulation of 9 semester hours. Undergraduate Non-degree Students, those seeking only undergraduate credit for course work taken, apply for approval to the Division of Continuing Educa\u00ad tion which will act as their college office. Graduate Non-degree Students, those seeking graduate credit, must register through the Graduate College. Selection of courses for those having long range plans of earning a degree should be made on the basis of information given in this catalog. Students in\u00ad terested in making a formal application for admission to the University should contact the office of Admissions, Clement House. Students presently enrolled and in good standing at another institution may take courses at the University of Vermont to transfer to their institutions. Visit\u00ad ing students are considered non-degree students and should contact the Division of Continuing Education for information and registration material. All non-degree students who would like assistance in planning educational programs and selecting courses should contact the Division of Continuing Education at Grasse Mount, (telephone 656-2085) Conferences and Institutes Conference activity is a rapidly increasing part of University life.

Courses of Instruction The University reserves the right to change these course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alphabetically, and the college in which each is located is indicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course, but is other\u00ad wise qualified to take it, may be permitted to enroll by the department. Courses numbered from 1 through 99 are elementary and intermedi\u00ad ate courses. Those numbered from 100 through 199 are advanced undergraduate courses. They usually have at least one year of prior work in that disci\u00ad pline as a prerequisite. They may be taken as minor courses, but in some departments only a limited number may be taken as major courses. They are not ordinarily available for graduate credit. Courses numbered from 200 through 299 are relatively more advanced courses for undergraduates which may also be taken for graduate credit by graduate students. They usually require at least two years of prior work in that and related disciplines. To obtain graduate credit the graduate student generally is expected to meet higher qualitative or quantitative expectations than the undergraduate student. Two numbers with a comma between (17,18) indicate that the separate semester courses may be taken independently for credit. Two hyphenated numbers (17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken independently for credit and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course de\u00ad scription. Odd-numbered courses are generally offered the first semester: even- numbered courses are generally offered the second semester; variations from this arrangement may be indicated by the Roman numeral I for the first semester or II for the second semester. The form (2-3) immediately following the course title indicates the number of class hours respectively of lecture and of laboratory. 142 143 Agricultural and Resource Economics COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE Professors Sinclair (Chairman), Sargent, Tremblay, and Webster; Associate Professors Fife and Gilbert; Assistant Professor Schmidt; Adjunct Professor Houghaboom; Adjunct Associate Professors Bevins and Eddy; and Adjunct Assistant Professor Bigalow.
