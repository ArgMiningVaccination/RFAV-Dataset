M cKinney School of Law Summer 2018 IssueAndrew R. Klein Dean and Paul E. Beam Professor of Law I am pleased to present this latest issue of The McKinney Lawyer, our school's alumni magazine, designed to keep you up-to-date on happenings in the life of the law school. As I write this, it occurs to me that our school does, indeed, almost have a life of its own, with the same types of ups and downs that we experience in our individual lives. For example, in the following pages, you will read that we celebrated two anniver - saries last fall: the 15th anniversary of our Master of Laws (LL.M.) program and the 20th anniversary of our Program in International Human Rights Law (PIHRL). The LL.M. program, founded by Professor Emeritus Jeff Grove, has graduated more than 650 students from 71 countries since its inception. Our PIHRL has had a similar inter - national reach. That program, founded by Professor George Edwards, has facilitated more than 250 internship placements for students in 67 countries. We are proud of these milestones and hope that you will enjoy reading about them. In this issue, we also celebrate the many professional opportunities that our school affords to graduates. We highlight alumni who have chosen Bright Lights/Big City careers, as well as those who choose to make noteworthy impacts in smaller locales, becoming part of the fiber of the communities in which they live. We are pleased to provide an educational foundation that allows our students to become successful in a wide variety of places and careers. Y ou will also read about faculty accomplishments, including IU McKinney Law's participation in the Indiana University \"Responding to the Addictions Crisis\" Grand Challenge initiative. Members of our Hall Center for Law and Health faculty, led by Professor Nic T erry, are playing important roles in this initiative, which ultimately will have a significant impact on the state of Indiana as well as the nation. Sadly, not all of our news in this issue is good. Just as we experience personal loss in our lives, so too, do we experience it in the life of the school. In December, Professor Emerita and former dean, Susanah M. Mead passed away after a short illness. I worked closely with Susie as her associate dean during the two years that she served as the law school's interim dean. Susie led her alma mater during a challenging period, and did so with the utmost in skill, professionalism, and grace. She will be greatly missed by faculty, staff and alumni alike. In this magazine you will find a tribute to Susie, an outstanding teacher and the first woman and alumnus to lead our school as dean. We will host a celebration of life for Susie, to which alumni are invited, on August 24th, here at Inlow Hall. Y ou will receive information about that memorial in the near future. I am also saddened to report that another professor, truly an icon of this school, Pro- fessor Lawrence A. Jegen, III, passed away in May. So many of the alumni that I have met over the years have shared their \" Jegen stories. \" He truly touched the lives of countless students during his 56 years of teaching. In April, we hosted an event honoring Larry, and announcing that a fund raising goal had been met that will allow establishment of the \"Lawrence A. Jegen, III Chair in T ax Law\"\u2014a fitting tribute to a larger-than-life faculty member whose legacy will live on at the school for years to come. Finally, I hope that you and yours will have a wonderful summer with some time for rest and relaxation\u2014and I look forward to the start of another year in the life of our school next fall.

Professor Hagan received the honor at the Women's History Month Leadership Reception on March 27 at the IUPUI Cam - pus Center. The program was centered on this year's National Women's History Month theme\u2014\"Nevertheless She Per - sisted\u2014Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. \" The keynote speaker at the IUPUI event was Myra Selby, the first woman and first African-American to serve as an Associ - ate Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court. Professor Hagan joined the faculty at IU McKinney in 2009 as a Clinical Asso - ciate Professor of Law. She directs the Civil Practice Clinic and the Civil Practice Clinic: Interdisciplinary Law and Social Work Clinic. In addition to being a Dean's Fellow in recognition of excellence in 2015 and 2016, Professor Hagan won the Black Cane Award for Best Professor in 2017 and was a recipient of a T rustee's T each - ing Award in 2013. Professor Boyne Named American Council on Education Fellow Professor Shawn Boyne has been named an ACE Fellow for academic year 2018-19, the American Council on Education (ACE) announced. \"For more than a half-century, the ACE Fellows Program has been a powerful en - gine fueling the expansion of a talented and diverse higher education leadership pipeline, \" said ACE President T ed Mitchell. \"We are excited to welcome this new class of Fellows and look forward to each enjoy - ing a transformative experience. \" Following nomination by the senior administration of their institutions and a rigorous application process, 45 Fellows were selected this year. IUPUI's Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Academic Officer Kathy E. Johnson nominated Professor Boyne for the ACE Fellowship. Professor Boyne has been at IU since 2008. She participated in IUPUI's Next Gen 2.0 Leadership Program's inau - gural cohort. During her tenure at the law school, Professor Boyne has received an IUPUI DRIVE Fellowship, a T rustee's T each - ing Award, as well as a Prestigious External Award Recognition (PEAR Award). She is a three-time recipient of the John S. Grimes Research Grant and has been elected as a Fellow in the European Law Institute (ELI). She plays an active role in the community teaching meditation at Pendleton Cor - rectional facility as well as for the Indiana State Bar's Judges and Lawyer's Assis - tance Program.IU McKinney Student Accepted to 2018 Human T rafficking Prevention Innovation Lab IU McKinney 3L Sarah Hanson has been ac - cepted into the 2018 Summer Human T raf - ficking Prevention Innovation Lab, a partner - ship between Indiana University's Center for the Study of Global Change and the Alliance for Freedom, Restoration, and Justice. The goal is to speed learning on issues and practices critical to ending human trafficking. Graduate students work to design a new course for IU students and help raise awareness about the effort across the university. \"I am extremely excited about getting the opportunity to be a part of the lab,\" Hanson said. \"It is a diverse group, all of whom have a passion for anti-trafficking and I'm hon - ored to be able to work alongside them.\" Hanson said she first learned about human trafficking at her church in 2012. Women at Risk, International, staged the awareness-raising event in the run-up to the Super Bowl in Indianapolis. That led to Hanson working for the group as an intern in Summer 2012. She also interned for a year in Bangkok, Thailand, with NightLight International, an affiliate of Women at Risk. Hanson's experience in Thailand prompt - ed her to want to go to law school, as she learned \"how difficult it can be for victims of human trafficking to get adequate or any recognition as victims with the justice system,\" she said. Hanson plans to prac - tice in this area of law after she completes her legal education. 2 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEProfessor Nicolas T erry T estifies Before Senate Committee on Opioid Misuse IU McKinney Law Professor Nicolas P . T erry testified Wednesday, May 23 before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Ag - ing during a hearing entitled, \"Preventing and T reating Opioid Misuse Among Older Americans. \" Professor T erry spoke before the com - mittee after U.S. Senator Joe Donnelly was instrumental in facilitating IU's par - ticipation in the hearing, following the uni - versity's new policy report on addressing the opioid epidemic. T erry's testimony ad - dressed opioid misuse among older Amer - icans. He also shared his research into the epidemic as part of Indiana University's Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenges initiative. News of the hearing was covered in a re - port by Indiana Public Media on National Public Radio stations. Professor T erry is the Hall Render Pro - fessor of Law at IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law, where he serves as the Executive Director of the Hall Center for Law and Health. He serves on the Scien - tific Leadership team for the University's $50 million \"Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge\" initiative and is engaged in research identifying barriers to effective opioids interventions to combat this public health crisis.IU McKinney T outed in International Jurist for its Master of Laws Program IU McKinney was highlighted in the International Jurist as a great choice for Master of Laws students because of its big-city life, experiential learn - ing, job opportunities, and overall law school experience. The magazine notes that LL.M. students can enter the pro - gram unsure of what track they want to study, and faculty and advisors will help students decide on which track best fits their goals. IU McKinney's LL.M. program has six tracks: American Law for Foreign Law - yers; Corporate and Commercial Law; Health Law, Policy, and Bioethics; Intel - lectual Property Law; International and Comparative Law, and International Hu - man Rights Law IU McKinney LL.M. students have the opportunity to study with justices of the Indiana Supreme Court, judges with the Indiana Court of Appeals, and other state government leaders. Master of Laws students also can gain practical experience and give back to the commu - nity by providing pro bono service to the World T rade Center Indianapolis, as well as other organizations.Professor Silva Named to IBJ Forty Under 40 Professor Lahny Silva has been named to the 2018 list of the Indianapolis Business Journal's Forty Under 40 honors program. Professor Lahny Silva is an Associate Professor of Law and Dean's Fellow at IU McKinney, where she has been a member of the faculty since the Summer of 2011. She has been honored by the law school and Indiana University for her teaching, and she has been named Faculty Advi - sor of the Y ear twice for her work with the Black Law Students Association. She is known in the community for her work with the Re-Entry and Community Help (REACH) Legal Assistance Program, which aims to help people who have been previously incarcerated take their places back in the community. In addition to REACH, Silva is on the advisory board for the Indiana Confer - ence for Legal Education Opportunity and serves on the Community Defenders board. She also helped students to estab - lish the Second Chance Re-entry Assis - tance Program and serves as the group's faculty advisor. \"I like to participate in boards that I have a direct connection to in my work, \" she said.News Briefs IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 3 4 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEJacob Ahler, '16 Law Office of Michael Riley P.C. On a typical work day, Jacob Ahler, '16, walks two blocks from his home in Rensselaer, Indiana (popu- lation: 5,902) to the law office he shares with Mi- chael Riley '62, in a historic building across the street from the 1880s-era Jasper County Courthouse. Only there is no typical day, exactly. As a lawyer in a small-town practice, Ahler sees it all: divorce, personal injury and real estate transactions. He serves as a contracted employee public defender in Jasper County and neighboring Tippecanoe Coun- ty, as well as attorney for the town of Wolcott. \"In a small town, you have to be willing to have a general practice of law,\" Ahler says. \"I had a lot of uncertainty at first, but in order to learn how to practice in these different areas, I just had to do it.\" It can be a challenge to steer clear of conflicts of interest. Because Ahler grew up in Rensselaer and his practice is so diverse, he knows many people on both sides of lawsuits and criminal cases, and may represent entities in his municipal practice that could intersect with prospective clients. Launching a small-town practice has been more lucrative and satisfying than Ahler first imagined. He returned to Rensselaer after graduating from Wabash College and IU McKinney, and short stints in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an assis-tant to former U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar, and as a law clerk at the law firm of Spagnolo & Hoeksema LLC in Chicago. The pace of small towns lends a natural work-life balance. Ahler often grabs a bite to eat at home for lunch. The cost of living and business overhead are both reasonable, and yet he is close to big-city lights: Ahler can drive for one hour and 25 minutes to the Located in Indiana's capitol and the state's largest city , IU McKinney naturally attracts students who live and plan to work in central Indiana. But with 11,000-plus alumni throughout the world, IU McKinney graduates prove they have what it takes to make it anywhere\u2014including the nation's largest and smallest cities and towns. What's it take to make it in the bright lights of the big city? And, what's the attraction to being a small town lawyer? Often the choice comes down to personal preferences, ac- cording to Chasity Thompson, '02, Assistant Dean in the Of-fice of Professional Development. In Indiana, many rural jurisdictions face a shortage of attor- neys, Dean Thompson notes. She has encouraged graduates from smaller Indiana communities to consider whether they might \"go back and give back\" to their hometowns, she says. \"There are opportunities to thrive, establish and grow a prac- tice, and advance quickly in a small town,\" Dean Thompson says. On the other hand, many IU McKinney students and recent alumni are from larger U.S. cities and want to return, or want to seek their fortunes in other urban areas. \"We try to take a holistic approach to career planning,\" Dean Thompson says. \"When we work with students and alumni, we put together individual advancement plans that consider numerous factors. Each person's path will look a little different, regardless of whether they are looking for employment in a bigger market, or a smaller community.\" In Small Towns and Big Cities, McKinney Alumni Thrive by Alicia Dean Carlson IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 5 May Li, '14 Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP May is at Wilson Elser Mos- kowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP in their midtown Manhattan office, where she works in the Coverage Counsel and Professional Liability Practice Group. Being an attorney in the nation's largest city nev- er gave Li pause. She's a native New Yorker who grew up in the borough of Queens, one of the most ethnically diverse urban areas in the world. That diversity\u2014both in work and life\u2014drew her back to New York (population: 19.85 million). \"What I like about work at a law firm in New York is the opportunity to work with a diverse cli-ent base, including international clients, to be able to work with and network with a variety of legal professionals, and to gain exposure to complex and challenging work,\" Li says. \"I love the city's vibrant energy and its melting pot of cultures.\" Li, who completed her undergraduate degree at Boston Col- lege, chose IU McKinney because of its high-ranking legal writ- ing program. Those legal writing and research skills, plus what she learned in the Program on Law and State Government-Public Policy Mediation class, are an asset in her current job, Li says. \"I occasionally attend mediations on behalf of my client, a legal malpractice insurer,\" Li says. \"Although the IU McKinney mediation class involved mediating in a state government setting, what I learned from this intensive introductory course was still very applicable and provided me a foundational understanding of mediations in general.\"south to arrive in the IU McKinney parking garage, or drive the same distance west to the Chicago Loop. Some days, Ahler feels like he's on a movie set for a small-town legal drama, especially at a local coffee shop where he regularly chews the fat with other members of the local bar. Older attorneys have been generous in sharing experience and even clients, as they retire or scale back their practices, he says. \"I've had some fantastic mentors here,\" Ahler says. Life in a small town means Ahler is often tapped for civic leadership opportunities. He serves on the Rensselaer Central School Board, is involved in the Knights of Columbus, Rota- ry Club, and volunteers with Boy Scout Troop 152, where he earned the rank of Eagle Scout. May Li, '14 Jacob Ahler, '166 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEAfter work, she enjoys spending time with family and friends, as well as taking in life in a city that doesn't sleep. \"There is always something to do, whether it's a new museum or art gallery opening up, watching a movie on a rooftop or enjoy- ing world-class concerts and performances during the summer, farmers markets, free yoga in Bryant Park, or seeing a fashion show during Fashion Week,\" Li says. \"There are countless job op- portunities, neighborhoods to explore, and ethnic foods to taste. Because NYC is accessible, you can get around very easily within the city, go out to Long Island to enjoy the beaches and the winer- ies, or go to Upstate, New York to enjoy fall foliage and hiking.\" James K. Wisco, '11, Lori & Wisco, P.A. At a recent meeting with a new client, Lori Craig, '15, discovered a family tie: The client was actually her husband's third cousin. To Craig, that genealogical discovery illustrates what practicing law in Martinsville (population: 11,828) is like. In conducting your law practice, you are bound to run into people you know, have known, or are related to. Those close community ties are a positive aspect of lawyering in a small town, Craig says. She is one of three IU McKinney graduates practicing at Foley Peden & Wisco, a firm founded in Martinsville in 1930. In fact, the law firm's website reminds virtual visitors of that reality. \"Thank you for visiting,\" the website says. \"We will see you around town.\" \"I love working at this firm,\" says Craig, who came to the com- munity through marriage to a Martinsville native. \"My life is root-ed here. Why would I want to go anywhere else?\" Located on the town square across from the circa 1859 red brick Morgan County courthouse, the law firm was a natural fit for James K. Wisco, '11, too. He grew up in Martinsville and, after college at IU Bloomington, left for Indianapolis and worked for the Indiana Senate. During law school and for two years after graduating from IU McKinney, Wisco lived in Indianapolis and liked it, but when the opportunity arose to join a law firm in Martinsville, he did. \"There's no firm I'd rather be associated with,\" Wisco says of the 88-year-old law firm that now bears his name. Operating a \"storefront\" law practice means that someone may walk in off the street without an appointment looking for a lawyer. \"There 's a lot of value in practicing law in a small com- munity,\" says Wisco. \"We have clients on every end of the finan-cial and legal spectrum, from sophisticated estate planning to pro bono criminal law.\" Martinsville native Tonisha Jarrett, '13, joined the firm in January 2018, although her experience in the legal community stretches back much further. As a student at Martinsville High School, Jarrett in- terned with a local attorney and decided to earn a law degree herself. When she graduated from IU McKinney, Jarrett returned to Martinsville and built up a law practice, specializing in family law, before starting work at Foley Peden & Wisco. She and Wisco also act as public defenders in Morgan County. In a small community, relations among members of the local bar are friendly and collegial, Jarrett notes. \"You can be on opposite sides in a fiercely contested issue, and as soon as the case is over, we can go to lunch,\" Jarrett says. \"I don't think you would necessarily find those kinds of professional friendships everywhere.\" Cristal Cabrera, '12 Cristal Law Firm As a student at IU McKinney, Cristal Cabrera, '12, got involved in the National Latina/o Law Student Association (NLLSA), an organization that has had a lasting impact on the course of her life and career by introducing her to Los Angeles, a city she now calls home and where she has a solo practice. Originally from Schererville, Indiana, Cabrera graduated from IU Bloomington before applying to IU McKinney, where she participated in the In-diana Conference for Legal Education Opportunity program. During law school, she worked for Indiana Legal Services in the Migrant Farmworker Law Pro- gram, where she was introduced to the wage and hour laws and labor laws, and The Julian Center, which introduced her to family T onisha Jarrett, '13, James K. Wisco, '11, and Lori Craig, '15 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 7 law issues and training in helping victims of domestic violence. As a 3L, Cabrera assisted with the planning of a national NLL- SA conference, which took her to Los Angeles (population: 4.03 million) for the first time and introduced her to students and faculty at UCLA Law School. \"Unintentionally, I was starting to build my LA network,\" she says. After passing the Indiana bar exam, Cabrera decided to check out LA again. She landed at Mil Mujeres Legal Services, a not-for-profit where she was able to use many of the skills she picked up during her professional experiences as a McKinney student. Three years ago, Cabrera hung out her shingle in private prac- tice as the founding partner of the Cristal Law Office, focusing on employment litigation and family law.\"It's been both exciting and terrifying at the same time,\" she says. \"But I've really enjoyed it.\" Recently in court for a \"monster hearing,\" heavy with briefings and turning on technicalities in the law, Cabrera reflected on law school. \"If I had not been prepared by the legal writing and re-search program at McKinney, I would be lost,\" she says. And, while the sunny California weather is nice, what's even nicer are the warm professional friendships, Cabrera says. \"It was intimidating at first, because I was in a brand new place,\" she says. \"Now that I have been here for six years, the legal world has become, if not smaller, much more familiar. The local plaintiffs' bar association is wonderful, too, which has been very helpful for my career in a giant city like Los Angeles.\" David B. Meehan, '14 Associate, Sidley Austin LLP When David B. Meehan, '14, was offered a job in Chicago, he jumped\u2014but only because it was just the right opportunity. Nothing personal, Indianapolis. \"I have a very soft spot in my heart for Indianapolis, and Indiana,\" he says. With a very specific goal in mind\u2014to climb the ladder at an international firm, advising public and private companies in the field of mergers and acquisitions\u2014Meehan left Krieg DeVault in India-napolis, despite his enjoying his experience there, to work in Chicago (population: 2.7 million), first at Paul Hastings, LLP, and then Sidley Austin LLP. In Chicago, the sheer volume of work with blue-chip clients has been helpful to gain relevant experience in M&A, he says. \"The more you do, the better you get,\" Meehan says. After graduating from Hanover College, Meehan worked as special assistant to former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and, later, as a policy analyst at the Indiana Economic Development Corp. When he went to law school, it was because \"most people making important decisions on a regular basis had a law degree, and in fact, many were McKinney grads,\" Meehan says. Meehan also earned a Master in Business Administration from the IU Kelley School of Business through McKinney's joint degree program. His experience as editor-in-chief of the Indiana Law Review taught him to be \"very conscientious about a prod-uct. It was the best training, by far,\" he says. \"McKinney does an incredible job of preparing their students,\" Meehan says. \"I feel like I've landed my dream job, working with the best and the brightest in the industry.\" The dream job\u2014as well as two young children\u2014leave Meehan with little free time for Chicago's attractions. \"We don't go to the fancy restaurants,\" he laughs. Cristal Cabrera, '12 David B. Meehan, '14Graduates of IU McKinney frequently are elected to public office. Alumni are mayors and city councilors, as well as state senators and representatives. In fact, McKinney alumni are elected to serve in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with enough fre-quency that the National Law Journal touted us as a \"Pipeline to Congress\" a few years ago. Y et few can boast the speed with which Shane Evans leapt into public service. Evans graduated from IU McKinney in May 2015 and was elected to the mayor's office of his hometown, Delphi, Indiana, six months later. When the incumbent mayor lost in the primary, quite literally four days prior to Evans' graduation from IU McKinney, \"I saw an opportunity to further improve this community, \" Evans says of his reasons for running for the office as an independent candi-date. Running for public office has always been on Evans' radar screen. He filed and ran for Indiana Representative District 25 while an undergraduate student, and was defeated in the general election during his 1L year at IU McKinney. Delphi had received a Stellar Community grant in 2012 from the Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs. That spurred a transformation of the downtown, the centerpiece of which was the restoration of the Delphi Opera House. The facility serves as a community center and performing arts venue. Evans wanted to continue the momentum and ran for mayor. He plans to pursue another term in office. Evans knew during high school that he wanted to pursue a legal career. He had worked for the prosecutor in Carroll County during his senior year, before enrolling at Wabash College and receiving a bach-elor's degree in chemistry. IU McKinney was an attractive choice for law school because of the geographical proximity to his hometown, and \"because of the practical experience I could gain while attending, \" Evans said. While in law school, a job offer working for an attorney in Delphi convinced him to return home after completing his legal education. \"Growing up, I had the opportunity to volunteer for organiza- tions and observe leaders who were able to accomplish unthink - able things with the assistance of the community, \" Evans said of Delphi. \"It truly is a great place to call home and I am glad to be back amongst the people of this city. \" McKinney Alum Finds Career Start in Public Service in Delphi Shane Evans, '15, is shown at the newly restored Delphi Opera House. by Rebecca Trimpe 8 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE Delphi, IndianaSmall TownEverywhere Jeff Been, '84, and Eric Graninger, '85, have lived has a history. When they met at IU McKinney, Been was rehabbing a row house on Alabama Street in the St. Joseph neighborhood. This was a few years before the neighborhood was designated a historic district in 1991. After graduating, Been taught legal writing at IU McKinney, and Gran- inger clerked for U.S. District Court Judge S. Hugh Dillin. They moved to Chicago in 1987 , where Been clerked in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and Graninger worked as a staff attorney at the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. They lived in the city's River North neighborhood, in the area's then-emerging warehouse district. After that, they moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where Been joined the Legal Aid Society, and Graninger, who is originally from Clarksville, Indi-ana, joined the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (USA). They moved into the historic Cherokee T riangle neighborhood. After serving as General Counsel at the headquarters, Graninger now is an assistant county attorney in the Civil Division for Jefferson County. Been retired as Legal Aid's Executive Director in 2016. They traveled frequently to Carroll County, Indiana, Been's home county, over the years to visit with family. When the nearly 170-year-old farmhouse that Been rode by every day on the school bus when he was young be-came available in 2015, they found it irresistible. He had always wondered what it was like inside. \"One day out of the blue it went on the market; my sister texted me about it, \" Been said. \"We scampered up to take a look at it, and quickly decided we wanted to make it part of our future. \" T urns out it wouldn't be the last piece of property in Carroll County that Been and Graninger would take on. They also bought a bunga-low on East Monroe Street in Delphi, the county seat, in 2016. This particular rehab project was featured in the November/December 2017 issue of Indiana Preservation magazine. And they joined in an effort to rehabilitate the Crosby Hotel in Delphi in 2017 . \"The community wanted to make sure it was rehabbed and re- stored in the best possible way, \" Graninger said, \"and we felt com-pelled to roll up our sleeves and take it on, too. \" \"We saw what the community had done around the opera house, \" Been said. \"Mayor Shane Evans, '15, is bringing some real leadership to the projects, and they could be the catalyst to bringing change to the city. We think it will help to bring people to Delphi, helping folks enjoy the richness of life up here in Carroll County. \" IU McKinney Graduates Find Avocation in Historic Restoration Jeff Been, '84, and Eric Graninger, '85, are shown in front of a house they are rehabbing on East Monroe Street in Delphi. by Rebecca Trimpe IU ROBERT H.

The scholarship provides generous funding for highly-qualified stu-dents pursuing a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree at IU McKin-ney who have a demonstrated interest in studying and practicing health law. The executive director of the law school's Hall Center for Law and Health, Professor Nicolas T erry, describes Evans as \"one of the finest health lawyers of his generation. \" A longtime leader of Indiana University Health, Evans now teaches at McKinney Law. He is an active participant in the Hall Center's health law and policy programming. Evans is recognized nationally as a successful health care ex - ecutive, health policy expert and community leader. During his 13 years as president and CEO of IU Health, one of the nation's largest academic health centers, Evans's vision led the health system's expansion from three hospitals in downtown Indianap-olis to a unified statewide health system of nearly 20 hospitals, treating more than 2.5 million patients a year. Throughout Ev - ans's tenure, IU Health was consistently included in the presti-gious U.S. News & World Report Annual Best Hospitals rankings, which also recognized IU Health as the No. 1 hospital in the State of Indiana. Evans is well known in federal and state public policy com- munities as an advocate for health and wellness programs and high-quality, accessible health care. Drawing from an accom-plished career as a health care executive, Evans provides insight into issues such as integrated health systems, academic health centers, payer-provider convergence issues, population health, value-based payments and digital health.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEJohn Hammond, III, '91, had encouraging words for IU McKinney students at a Leadership Luncheon October 4, 2017 at the law school. Hammond, co-chair of Ice Miller's Public Affairs Group, talked to stu- dents about his career, experiences in Indiana state government, and combining law school with work and family. While working in state govern-ment, Hammond also was a part-time law student in the school's evening program, and was raising a family, which presented its challenges, he said. \"Law school is like a marathon, \" Hammond said. During the 1980s, he served as a key aide to former Indiana Governor Robert D. Orr, and served as senior executive assistant for Legislative Af - fairs and Education Policy in the Orr administration, serving as chief leg - islative liaison for six general sessions and three special sessions of the Indiana Legislature. Hammond has helped shape public policy on taxes, environmental management, education, tort reform, transportation, in-surance, and economic development. In 2017 , he was named vice chair - man of the Presidential Nominating Process Committee for the Republi-can National Committee and serves as one of three Indiana members of the Republican National Committee. Hammond urged students to use their careers to make a difference, and to consider public service as a \"noble, honorable\" role in society. Both law school and public service involve financial and personal sacrifices, but Ham-mond told students that by choosing the legal profession and IU McKinney, they had \"chosen the right path, and the right place to pursue that path. \" Beth Compton, '92, was the featured speaker at a Leadership Luncheon on T uesday, October 24, 2017 . She serves as Chicago-based Regional Director for Compliance and Monitoring at Affiliated Monitors, Inc., where she manages moni-toring cases for health care providers, serves as a team member for monitoring of large corporate clients and serves as the point of contact for attorneys, government regulators and business entities in the Midwest. Compton discussed her career path from undergraduate psychology ma- jor to law school. As a law student, she took a job in a small Indianapolis firm, where she continued to work after graduation. \"It was great experience, \" she said. The best part of her career as a litigator in the private sector was rep-resenting individual clients and her daily work in the city and county courts. Later, she was tapped for roles in Indiana state government, including as Deputy Attorney General and Section Chief, responsible for overseeing in-vestigations and prosecution of healthcare providers; Executive Director of the Indiana Health Professions Bureau; and Deputy Counsel and policy advi-sor to Governor Frank O'Bannon. After relocating to Chicago, Compton served as General Counsel for the Il- linois Department of Juvenile Justice from 2009 through 2016, managing all agency litigation. Compton advised students to use their networking skills. \"It's not just who you know, but who you know in other arenas that can spark ideas about what you might do in your career, \" she said.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 15 A project at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law is one of 16 chosen for Phase One of Indiana University's statewide \"Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenges Initiative.\" Legal and Policy Best Practices in Response to the Opioid Epidemic is a collaboration between Ross D. Silverman, professor of health policy and management at the Fairbanks School of Public Health and professor of public health and law at IU McKinney, and Nicolas P. Terry, Hall Render Professor of Law and executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at the law school. Their work is part of IU's $50 million commitment to prevent, reduce and treat addictions in Indiana. Indiana is one of four states where the fatal drug overdose rate has more than quadrupled since 1999. Hoosiers are now more likely to die from a drug overdose than a car accident. According to the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI, the total cost of drug overdoses in Indiana tops $1 billion annually, measured in medical ex- penses and lifetime earnings losses. Indiana is not alone in this crisis. In 2016, more people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. than the total number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. On April 26, the researchers released their recommendations to combat this crisis in Indiana. They call for broader and more robust harm-reduction strategies, programs to reduce the stigma of substance use disorder, the creation of broader drug take-back programs, and more expansive \"wraparound services\" such as job training or housing assistance to support those recovering from substance use disorder. Health Law Professors Collaborate on IU Addictions Crisis Grand Challenges Project The recommendations offer local, state and federal governments an array of strategies for mitigating the opioid addictions crisis, including: Prioritize harm reduction: Communities should increase the availability of the overdose-reversal drug naloxone; encourage the work of syringe exchange pro- grams; and support first responders by investing in safe spaces as a route to treatment. Remove legal impediments that hold up effective responses: improve Indiana's Good Samaritan and drug paraphernalia laws; better coordinate federal pri- vacy law; and make it easier for those with substance use disorder to receive Medicaid services. Invest in more and better evidence-based treatment services: pay for improved care coordination and wrap-around services such as safe housing; and make resources available to offer counseling, help those re-entering society, and care for children born with neonatal abstinence disease. 16 IU ROBERT H.

Third row: Professor Nicolas T erry and Professor Ross Silverman.Health Law Professors Collaborate on IU Addictions Crisis Grand Challenges Project The researchers drew insights from interviews with key stakeholders from community agencies, the health care industry, law enforcement, court officials and government leaders, among others. \"It is vital that policymakers put evidence-based harm reduction and treatments at the center of our policy dis- cussion in order to create meaningful progress toward solving this epidemic,\" said Professor Terry. \"After extensive research, we believe these recommendations will be most readily implementable and impactful to the communities that adopt them. These are necessary changes. The reality is that some current laws and policies are barriers to the implementation of effective interventions.\" In addition to project leads, Professors Terry and Silverman, Aila Hoss, a visiting assistant professor and IU Grand Challenges Fellow at the McKinney School of Law, also participated in the work. This report comes as part of IU's Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge, which brings together IU's world-class faculty, as well as its business, nonprofit and government partners to create a comprehensive plan to reduce deaths from addiction, ease the burden of addiction on Hoosier communities, and improve health and economic outcomes. As part of IU's Grand Challenges program, this collaborative, statewide initiative is the nation's largest and most comprehensive university-led response to the opioid addictions crisis. Professor Terry serves on the Scientific Leadership Team for Responding to the Addictions Crisis. The grant team also includes professors Silverman and Hoss, as well as student research assistants from IU McKinney and the Fairbanks School of Public Health. IU announced the launch of Phase One, including the McKinney project in February. The initial pilot grants feature collaborative teams of faculty members, researchers, community organizations and cross-sector part-ners. Together, the projects address all five focus areas of the statewide initiative: ground-level data collection and analysis; training and education; policy analysis and development; addictions science; and community and workforce development. IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 17 The American Bar Association's Office of Diversity and Inclusion has partnered with the IU McKinney School of Law to co-launch the Path- way to the Law online program, a three-year pilot project to create a pipeline for underrepresented students into legal education and ulti- mately the profession. The program, funded with a $250,000 grant from the ABA, began in the spring and is based at the McKinney School of Law with an ini- tial class of 30 students from IUPUI. The program's intent is to help undergraduate students develop their skills in critical thinking, read- ing comprehension, and strategies for studying and test preparation. It also aims to broaden their understanding of the legal profession and give them access to mentors and networking opportunities as early as possible. \"I am very proud that the IU McKinney School of Law is at the forefront of national efforts to achieve greater inclusion and diversity in the legal pro-fession,\" said Dean Andrew R. Klein. \"We are excited to work with the ABA, utilizing both online resources and a personal approach to introduce a new generation of talented students to the field of law.\" The curriculum includes four online courses: Introduction to the Legal Profession, Legal Writing Skills, Critical Thinking and Comprehension Skills, and Advanced Critical Thinking and Comprehension Skills. Courses are designed in conjunction with E-Learning Design Services, the primary online design arm of the Indiana University Office of Online Education. Students will also be mentored by attorneys, current law students, and law faculty members. Faculty involved in the project include Vice Dean Antony Page, and Pro- fessors Max Huffman and Lahny Silva, who are directing the grant. Pro-fessors Carrie Hagan, Allison Martin and Cynthia Adams are teaching the courses. Also involved are Professors Shana Stump and Erin Engels, '99, from the School of Liberal Arts. Others who were instrumental in the creation of the project were instruc- tional designers Matt Callison and Carrie Hansel, and principal instruc- tional designer Julia Sanders, all from IU e-learning Design and Services. Additionally, IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs Assistant Dean Suzann Lupton, '91, and Kristina Horn Sheeler of the IU School of Liberal Arts played roles in developing the project. Individuals interested in participating as an alumni mentor, or in recommending students for the program, should contact Professor Max Huffman. Depending on the program's success, the ABA could expanded it nation- ally in the future. The goal of the program is to develop a metrics-driven pipeline program model that colleges and laws schools nationwide can implement to increase the number of diverse and underrepresented under- graduate students entering law school and the legal profession. The McKin- ney Law grant leadership team is pursuing support structures for continu-ing the program in future years at the school.

IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 39 Like many lunchtime events involving students at IU McKin- ney, this one took place over pizza. But this program didn't involve a lecture. This meeting was a session of the Profes- sional Development Institute, and focused on helping students to build the skills necessary to find that all-important first job after law school. The brainchild of law school alumna Chasity Thompson, '02, As- sistant Dean of the Office of Professional Development, the Insti-tute is a program that engages students and helps them to acquire the skills they need to become successful following graduation. The program was funded by a gift from IU McKinney alumnus, James Barkley, '77, and his wife, Cindy, as part of the university's ongoing For All campaign. The Institute helps students to discover potential career paths they may not have otherwise considered through an assessment designed specifically for law students. Participants also learn about the legal market, and develop and polish the professional skills they will need in the real world. Videotaped interviews that are critiqued by staff of the Office of Professional Development (OPD), provide just one element of the training that is offered. Students have the opportunity to connect with one another, with IU McKinney alumni, and grow their professional networking op-portunities. Those who take part in the Institute also receive train- ing in resiliency and public speaking.

IU McKinney's Professional Development Institute Prepares Students for Next Steps Following Law School times each semester during the academic year. First-year student Arq'eil Shaw has already seen the program's benefits. The first man in his family to attend college, Shaw says he lacked the skills he needs to be successful in the legal profes- sion, and that he's gaining them through the Institute. He has an outgoing personality, and has \"been teaching myself as I go along,\" Shaw said. \"However, the Institute helps in the areas where I am weakest, while reinforcing the areas where I am strong. I think this is a fantastic program.\" Shaw's classmate, 1L Michael Sherman, agreed. \"I wanted to participate in the Institute because I felt that having more guidance in developing my professional abilities would be beneficial, not just while I'm in law school but in the years to come,\" Sherman said. \"I value education and learning how the professional world is con- stantly changing. Learning how best to adapt is always important, regardless of the stage of your professional life.\" 40 IU ROBERT H.

The pair discussed how healthcare providers are seeking innovative strategies to conserve capital, manage populations, tie up referrals and find efficiencies. On October 5, Elizabeth Sepper, Professor of Law, Washington Uni- versity St. Louis School of Law, presented \"Religion and Reproductive Health in a Consolidating Healthcare Market.\" Professor Sepper, a health law scholar whose work explores the inter- action of morality, professional ethics, and law in health care and insur- ance, has written extensively on conscientious refusals to provide repro-ductive and end-of-life healthcare and on conflicts over religious liberty and insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive coverage mandate. In her Grand Rounds lecture at IU McKinney, Professor Sepper noted the trend toward the many church-affiliated hospital systems acquiring hospitals and offering healthcare limited by religious doctrine, as well as hospitals that continue to follow those restrictions, especially in re- productive and end-of-life care, even after mergers or acquisitions that severed ties from religious organizations. On November 9, Leo Beletsky, Associate Professor of Law and Health Sciences, Northeastern University School of Law, presented \"Murder by Overdose: Deploying Punishment as an Antidote to the Overdose Crisis.\" Professor Beletsky, who holds a joint appointment at the School of Law and Bouv\u00e9 School of Health Sciences, is also a faculty scholar with the Institute on Urban Health Research. An interdisciplinary social epi- demiologist, he has examined issues related to the role of law and law enforcement relating to drug policy, prevention of HIV and other infec- tious diseases, human rights, and evidence-based healthcare. At IU McKinney, Professor Beletsky discussed the complicated issues surrounding how the traditional pillars of law are being interpreted as law enforcement, courts, and lawmakers struggle to find solutions to a widespread opioid epidemic. He urged a different approach. \"It's called an 'epidemic,' and if it is an epidemic, let's use public health research methods,\" he said.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEENVIRONMENTAL, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES LAW PROGRAM Indiana State University Professor Jennifer C. Latimer chose a career in science to help people through research and teaching, and her newest tool is the power of language. Latimer, Associate Professor of Geology in the Department of Earth and Environmental Systems at Indiana State Univer- sity, chose to earn a Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.) degree at IU McKinney Law to learn the language of lawyers. It was a style of communication that she frequently encoun- tered in her work, reviewing environmental policy, legislation and lawsuits, and it frustrated her. \"I was a scientist who under- stood the science in these documents written by lawyers, but I thought that if I learned to speak their language, they might listen to me,\" Latimer said. The M.J. degree program at IU McKinney is designed for in- dividuals interested in developing a better understanding of the law, but who do not wish to practice law or earn a J.D. degree. Students can choose from a list of courses that cover the substan- tive areas of the law that best suit their needs. Latimer, who earned her master's degree at IUPUI and Ph.D.at IU-Bloomington, will graduate from McKinney in December 2018, says that what she has learned in the M.J. program has \"changed the way I teach\" her environmental science classes at ISU. She credits McKinney law professors Carlton Waterhouse, Dean's Fellow and director of the Environmental, Energy and Natural Resources Law Program, and Florence Roisman, Wil- liam F. Harvey Professor of Law, with providing a historical per- spective on environmental law and social justice. \"I have a much greater understanding of environmental law and how it intersects with social justice and public health issues that are really legacy problems, often rooted in racial, economic and social policies and deeply engrained in our system of govern- ment,\" Latimer says. As part of a project for Professor Waterhouse's environmental justice course, she developed a one-week environmental justice honor's seminar for high school students on the ISU campus. Soon after, Professor Waterhouse connected Latimer with the Indiana Chapter of the NAACP that resulted in community en- gagement in northwest Indiana. East Chicago is home to the EPA's USS Lead Superfund site, which gained national attention starting in Summer 2016 after ISU Professor Takes on Environmental Law in McKinney Master's Program more than 1,000 individuals were evacuated from the West Calu- met Housing Complex due to dangerously high toxins in the soil. In 2017, with the NAACP and her ISU students, Latimer helped organize a Community Science program to educate East Chicago families and children about potential lead contamina- tion in their neighborhoods. Students from two middle schools learned to use home testing kits to collect samples from across East Chicago, which revealed that lead contamination was not limited to the previously identified Superfund site. Latimer was thrilled when at the end of one event, the East Chicago middle school students shouted, \"We are scientists!\" Legal writing instruction and IU McKinney's public policy mediation course with Professor John L. Krauss also had an im- pact on how she writes, communicates, and helps others com- municate the issues that concern them. Beyond those new skills, however, Latimer appreciates the ex- perience of combining her academic career with the M.J. degree program at IU McKinney Law. \"I already have a career, so this degree program has been stress-free learning for me\u2014I'm learn- ing something of interest to me, which has been very enjoyable.\" IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 51 ENVIRONMENTAL, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES LAW PROGRAM After EPA, McKinney Professor Continues to Make Headlines Since coming to IU McKinney, Professor of Practice Janet McCabe has drawn national me- dia attention\u2014including in The New York Times and National Public Radio\u2014for her exper-tise as a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air administrator. Among the recent stories: \"Fossil Fuel Industry Pushes for Clean Power Plan Replacement,\" aired on National Public Radio on December 21, 2017. NPR national-desk reporter Jeff Brady reported that although President Trump's administration has repealed the Obama administra- tion's Clean Power Plan, many fossil fuel companies who fought for such a move are now asking for new regulations. Professor McCabe said, \"Most people would say we already have run out of time to avoid any impacts of excess carbon in the atmo- sphere. It's already warmer. Storms are already more extreme. There's already sea level rise and more flooding. So we better get busy.\" The Chicago Tribune called on her expertise for a February 8 story, \"Another break for Foxconn? EPA office led by Gov. Walker's former aide to decide smog pollution rules,\" about how the E.P.A. tentatively concluded late last year that most of southeast Wiscon- sin needs to take more aggressive action to reduce lung-damaging smog. The story noted that the analysis \"infuriated\" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has promised to relax state environmental laws and access to Lake Michigan for Foxconn, a Chinese manu- facturer planning to build a new electronics factory just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the state's dirtiest air. Professor McCabe said the smog regulations in question have withstood several court challenges and are grounded in well- documented medical research. In a March 14, 2018 opinion piece in the Indianapolis Star, Professor McCabe said that commuters frustrated with dodging potholes on city streets should consider how climate change is playing a role. \"While there are lots of reasons for potholes on our city streets, chief among them are the rapid freezing-warming-freezing patterns that have been the hallmark of Indiana's recent winters. These conditions are the result of observable changes in Indiana's climate that scientists predict will continue\u2014and worsen\u2014well into the future.\" Infrastructure has been designed and built with certain assumptions about temperature and precipitation, but facts on the grounds are changing, Professor McCabe wrote. She suggested that government will ultimately need to create a plan for dealing with future logistical challenges of city streets that takes into account environmental change. With former E.P.A. administrator Gina McCarthy, Professor McCabe penned a March 26 op-ed for The New York Times, \"Scott Pruitt's Attack on Science Would Paralyze the E.P.A.\" The article took issue with the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for announcing that he would no longer allow the agency to use studies that include nonpublic scientific data to develop rules to safeguard public health and prevent pollution. \"Some of those studies, particularly those that determine the effects of exposure to chemicals and pollution on health, rely on medi- cal records that by law are confidential because of patient privacy policies. These studies summarize the analysis of raw data and draw conclusions based on that analysis. Other government agencies also use studies like these to develop policy and regulations, and to buttress and defend rules against legal challenges. They are, in fact, essential to making sound public policy,\" the authors said. 52 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEENVIRONMENTAL, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES LAW PROGRAM IU McKinney Law Professor of Practice Janet McCabe was presented with a Knozone Lifetime Achievement Award by Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett at the Indianapolis Sustainability Summit on March 31, 2018.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 63 INTERNATIONAL UPDATES IU McKinney's Program in International Human Rights Law (PIHRL) celebrated its 20th anniversary with a special program on December 1 at Inlow Hall. The program featured remarks by Dean Emeritus Nor- man Lefstein who was dean of the school when the program was founded in 1997 by Professor George Edwards. Other speakers included Dean Andy Klein, Indiana Supreme Court Justice Steven David, and Major Rex Padgett of the Indiana National Guard, along with current and former PIHRL pro- gram participants. Over the years, the program has embarked on an extraor- dinary range of global activities, including nearly 250 intern placements in 67 countries. Students work with private human rights organizations, governmental bodies, and the United Nations. In addition, dozens of McKinney students, faculty, staff, and alumni have gone to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Ft. Meade, Maryland, to monitor Guantanamo Military Commission hearings. At the anniversary celebration, a U.S. flag was dedicated to the Indiana National Guard, and another U.S. flag was dedicated to IU McKinney. Both flags were flown over Camp Justice at Guantanamo Bay on September 11, 2016, the 15th Anniversary of 9/11, and also flown over the U.S. Cap - itol on President Obama's 2009 Inauguration Day. One of these flags now hangs at the Indiana National Guard head- quarters in Indiana, and the other will be displayed at the law school. Professor Edwards said he modeled the PIHRL on the Human Rights Program that was founded at Harvard Law School when he was a J.D. student there. \"As one of the first Harvard law student interns in their new overseas hu- man rights internship program, I interned in Ethiopia and Sudan during one summer and at the United Nations in Geneva the second summer,\" Professor Edwards said. \"At Indiana, I hoped to facilitate similar international work op- portunities for our J.D. and LL.M. students.\" The program has grown over the years to encompass a wide range of endeavors in the international human rights law arena. \"Internships are only one component of our PIHRL,\" Pro- fessor Edwards said. \"The PIHRL mission includes teaching international human rights law, researching and publishing in interna-tional human rights law, providing professional assistance to different types of organizations around the globe, and providing international human rights law internship opportunities for our students.\" PIHRL has received invaluable support from IU McKinney over the two decades in the program's history, Professor Edwards said, and the accomplishments of IU McKinney students who have taken part in the program are a tremendous source of pride. \"I am very proud of each and every one of the students who has served as an intern over the last 20 years,\" Professor Edwards said. \"Each former intern accomplished a great deal on the ground, pro-moting and protecting the rights of people around the globe, many of whom would have no one to advocate on their behalf.\" Celebration Marks 20th Anniversary of Program in International Human Rights Law 64 IU ROBERT H.

The PIHRL has a history of working on issues with or related to the military, said Professor George Edwards, who founded PIHRL and is its director. The program's first major interaction with the military came in 2003, when the Pentagon asked for a law project related to the U.S. Mili- tary Commissions at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Professor Edwards said. Out of that initial effort grew the U.S. Military Commission Observation Project, which sends representatives to witness court proceedings re- lated to terrorism cases. \"We decided that the PIHRL wanted to honor sacrifices made by members of the U.S. military in a formal way, \" Professor Edwards said. \"We decided to seek to pay tribute at an important U.S. military shrine. We chose Arlington. \" Among those who took part in the ceremony was Suvd Program in International Human Rights Law Places Wreath at T omb of Unknown Soldier T uul, LL.M. '16. \"It was such an honor for me to attend the ceremony, \" T uul said. \"T aking part in the ceremony gave us a great chance to thank those soldiers and their loved ones, to show that they are still missed and loved, and to remind others not to forget about them and not stop thanking them. \" T uul is originally from Mongolia, and organized a Summer 2017 internship for IU McKinney 3L Jacob Irven to the LGBT Centre of Mongolia.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINEFaculty News Self-Directed Mentoring Works for IU McKinney Faculty Five members of the faculty at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law received funding from IUPUI and created MUSCLE, or Mentoring Untenured Scholars for Clinical and Legal Scholarship Excellence. Implemented in 2015, Pro-fessors Yvonne Dutton, Carrie Hagan, Margaret Ryznar, Lea Shaver, and Lahny Silva, each received modest travel funding to enable them to meet with mentors in their various areas of expertise. \"I am very grateful that the university has invested in the junior faculty through this program, \" Professor Ryznar said. \"It has allowed me to connect with mentors around the country and to focus on becoming a better teacher and scholar. \" Thanks to the program, Professor Dutton was able to attend a conference in her field that gave her the chance to deepen relationships with several mentors; Professor Hagan was able to attend a two-week international trip where she spent time working with two important clinical mentors; Professor Ryznar trav - eled to Washington, D.C., where she met one-on-one with senior scholars; Professor Shaver added mentoring days onto two other trips; and Professor Silva attended a conference that emphasizes mentorship among black, female law professors. Professors Dutton, Ryznar, and Shaver wrote about the experience in an article titled, Advancing Faculty Diversity Through Self-Directed Mentoring. The piece was published in the Duke Journal of Gender & Law Policy . \"Most people think of mentoring in terms of official, top-down initiatives, \" Professor Shaver said. \"But the research shows that informal mentoring is actually more valuable. This shaped our bottom-up approach to the project, encouraging junior faculty to proactively seek out advice and build relationships with a network of informal mentors. The extra travel funding allowed me to accept invitations that I otherwise would have had to decline. Alongside those events, I set up hours of one-on-one meetings with outstanding scholars at Y ale, Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley. They were happy to help, and those conversations proved crucial to fram-ing my book project and thinking about post-tenure goals. Participating in MUSCLE has changed the way I think about mentoring. I'm much more intentional now about the ways that I can help my students beyond the classroom. I also encourage them to be proactive in cultivating a network of mentors. \" \"The MUSCLE program support made me think more about mentoring, and it made me more willing to seek out addi-tional opportunities to connect with senior scholars and other scholars in my field, \" Professor Dutton said. \"It was a great ac-countability mechanism that forced me to get out there and ask for advice and input from people 'outside the building.

Brian Bade, '09, Coach of the 8th-Grade Blackford Bruins Hoosier hysteria is part of life in Indiana, but for Brian Bade, '09, it hits a little closer to home. Bade coaches his stepson, Jerrid, and the other eighth-graders on the Blackford Bru-ins' boys basketball team. Nothing unusual about a father coaching his son's basket - ball team, unless you account for the fact that Bade is an attor - ney with a very busy schedule. Bade practices in the firm, Bade & Bade, that he opened with his father, Bruce Bade, '68. When Brian graduated from IU McKinney, he didn't hesitate to move back to Hartford City and set up shop with his father, where his shingle hangs across the street from the courthouse. Bruce Bade, now age 77 and retired mostly from the practice, han-dles the firm's wills and estate cases. A huge sports fan, Brian enjoyed all Indianapolis had to offer while at IU McKinney, attending Indianapolis Colts games and sporting events at Butler University. When Jerrid expressed an interest in basketball as a third-grader, Brian started working with him on funda-mentals. He enjoyed the experience so much that he started coaching the team when his son entered fourth-grade, and has continued into his fifth season, coaching Jerrid's eighth-grade team this season. \"It's been an absolute pleasure for me, \" he said. Brian quite literally grew up with the law, accompanying his father, who was Blackford County's Circuit Court judge for 31 years, on the circuit during the summer months. \"It wasn't specifically anything about the law, \" Brian says of his decision to enter the practice, \"it was growing up and seeing him do it, seeing him interact with colleagues. The impression I had as a child was that people got along with my dad. They liked and respected him. \" But it was the time that Bruce Bade was able to devote to his family that made the biggest impression.\"My dad was always very good to me and my sisters,\" Brian said. \"The practice provided him with a good income, and afforded him a lot of time to spend with his family. I had such a good childhood. \" Sounds like he's passing that legacy on. IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 85 Class Notes Justin E.

Dean Mead was the first woman and first gradu- ate of IU McKinney to serve as dean of the school, a position she held from 2005 until 2007 . Current IU McKinney Law Dean Andrew R. Klein, who served as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs while Mead was Interim Dean, said of her, \"She became more than just a friend and colleague\u2014but also a role model for how to handle even the most dif - ficult issues with patience, thoughtfulness, and grace. Perhaps the core of what I learned from Susie is the importance for a leader to confront challenges head-on, and the value of doing so in an open and civil fashion. Every single person in our law school community had tremendous respect for her judgment and for her integrity. I am deeply saddened by her passing, and I will miss her terribly. \" Dean Mead was a graduate of T udor Hall School for Girls in Indianapolis and Smith College. Following her graduation (summa cum laude) from IU McKinney in 1976, she clerked for two years for the Honorable Paul H. Buchanan, then chief judge of the Indiana Court of Appeals. She returned to the law school in 1978 to begin a career in legal education that spanned 35 years. She served the institution in multiple roles including as a legal writ - ing instructor, and director of the legal writing program. She was one of the first tenured female law professors at IU McKinney, teaching torts and products liability. In 1997 , she was appointed to the role of associate dean for academic affairs, where she worked with the dean in helping to lead the law school through an ambitious capital campaign that resulted in the construction of the law school's cur - rent home, Lawrence W. Inlow Hall. Among her contributions to legal education was the cre- ation of the Dean's T utorial Society, one of the first organized, volunteer, peer tutoring efforts in a law school in the nation. In 2005, Susie Mead was hand-picked by the IUPUI Chancellor to serve as interim dean of the law school. For two years, she led the school through an extremely challenging tran- sition and tight financial budget period with the utmost honesty, poise, and professional- ism. She served as a role model for countless students, faculty and staff members, who held her in high esteem. Dean Mead served on many law school and university com- mittees, including the Advisory Committee for the IUPUI Master Plan. Additionally, she was co-chair of the Indiana State Bar As- sociation's Conclave on Legal Education in 2007 . Former Dean, Susanah M. Mead, '76In Memoriam 88 IU ROBERT H.

Dean Mead was a mem- ber of the board of directors of the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site for nine years, and was serving on its Advisory Cabinet and as chair of its Strategic Planning T ask Force at the time of her passing. \"We found Susie to be an unwavering friend and indefatigable leader, \" said Charles Hyde, President and CEO of the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site. \"She was always ready to take on any challenge, and would jump into a project with a whip-smart intel- lect and a work ethic to match. Susie was a great advocate, and left an indelible mark as one of the architects of our ambitious new strategic plan. \" Susie was an avid supporter of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, the Indianapolis Opera, and the Indiana Repertory Theatre. Additionally, she was a member of the Indiana Historical Society's \"Living Legends\" selection committee, the Indiana Bar Association's Buchanan Award selection committee, and served on the Vestry of Christ Church Cathedral. Dean Mead was honored by the Indianapolis Bar Foundation as a Distinguished Fellow in 2006 for her outstanding commit - ment to the legal profession.

M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE 89 Professor Lawrence A. Jegen, IIIIn Memoriam Professor Lawrence A. Jegen, III, passed away on May 17 , 2018, at his home in Indianapolis. He was 83 years old. He taught at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law for 56 years before his retirement in 2018. He joined the faculty in 1962 as an As- sistant Professor, was promoted to an Associate Professor two years later, and became a full professor in 1966. \"It is hard to understate the impact that Professor Jegen made on the lives of others during his remarkable 56-year career at our law school,\" said IU McK - inney Dean Andrew R. Klein. \"Using the word 'legend' might sound like hyperbole, but today it does not. The outpouring of affection that I have heard from generations of McKinney Law alumni is overwhelming. This is a sad day for our law school family, but also a moment to remember the incredible difference that a teacher can make. We will miss Professor Je- gen, but never forget him. \" Professor Jegen was named the Thomas F. Sheehan Professor of T ax Law and Policy in 1982, a title he held until his retirement. During his career, Professor Jegen taught in the areas of civil and criminal law, federal and state taxation, business and estate planning, and philanthropy. He was re- nowned as one of his generation's top tax scholars. Professor Jegen was, by appointment of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, a member of the Commissioner's Advisory Committee from 1981 to 1982, and he received nine Certificates of Recognition from the In- ternal Revenue Service for contributions to the education of Internal Revenue Service personnel. Further, due to his contributions to the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, he at -tended the signing of the Act, at President Gerald Ford's invitation, in the Rose Garden at the White House on Labor Day in 1974. \"Larry was a great mentor, colleague, and friend, \" said Professor Emeritus Thomas B. Allington, who he taught at IU McKinney from 1970 to 2007 . \"We shared an office suite in the old law school building and had many long talks and arguments about tax law and teaching law students. I learned a lot but never caught up with him. \" Professor Jegen served as Internal T ax Counsel to Indiana University, as a represen- tative of Indiana University to the National Association of College and University Attor - neys, and as a co-founder and former co-di- rector of the Annual T ax Institute for Colleges and Universities. Indiana Court of Appeals Judge Margret Robb, '78, recalled the roast that the IU McK - inney Alumni Association held for Professor Jegen in honor of his, at that time, 25 years in teaching. In addition to former students telling stories about Professor Jegen, the man him- self joined as well, telling stories to the delight of the crowd, she said. \"Y ou have to be an enormously confident person to laugh when you hear stories about yourself, and join in the telling, \" Judge Robb said, recalling Professor Jegen's wonderful sense of humor. \"We're all going to miss him. We already do. \" One of Professor Jegen's first students, Robert H. Everitt, '65, told a story that provides an example of that sense of humor, and Jegen's willingness to go to great lengths to set up a joke. A student asked for permission to bring his spouse to the last class of the semester. The student had been talking about Professor Jegen at home, and the 90 IU ROBERT H. M cKINNEY SCHOOL OF LAW I SUMMER 2018 ALUMNI MAGAZINE(ABOVE) Professor Jegen is shown here immediately prior to a commencement ceremony in the early 1990s.student wanted his wife to have an opportunity to witness Jegen's teaching style first hand, and the professor agreed. Professor Jegen told the class he wanted to discuss a particular case that had recently been decided. No one in the class had read it, and Professor Jegen's frustration grew as he called on students who didn't know about the decision. \"This is embarrassing to me as a teacher, and I'm sure it's embarrassing to you as students, \" Everitt recalled Professor Jegen saying. \"Why, I'm sure that even a layper - son would know about the facts of this case and why it's so impor - tant. \" Professor Jegen proceeded to call upon the spouse, whom he had coached about the case ahead of time. The spouse knew all about the case, to the mortification of the class, Everitt said. The list of Professor Jegen's honors and accolades is as extensive as it is impressive. He received the Thomas Hart Benton Mural Me- dallion, which is the highest award granted by Indiana University, in 1993 and in 2003. He received the President's Circle Commemorative Medallion for exceptional support of Indiana University in 1999. He re- ceived the IU President's Distinguished T eaching Award in 1989; Excellence Recognition Award in 1997; and IU McKinney's Black Cane Award for Most Outstanding Law Professor six times. Professor Jegan was honored by the law school's Alumni Association on five different occasions; received IU's T rustees T eaching Award in 1997; and was chosen as a T eacher of Significance in a general poll of all Indiana University undergraduate and graduate students in 1980. In 2018, an endowed chair, the Lawrence A. Jegen, III Chair in T ax Law, was created in his honor. \"Larry will be sorely missed, but I am so grateful that, through the Jegen Chair, we had a chance to tell him how much his students and colleagues admired him, \" said Michael D. Freeborn, '72. He is a part - ner at Freeborn & Peters in Chicago, and a member of IU McKinney's Board of Visitors. \"By the time I graduated in 1972, he already had al- most a decade of experience teaching, having started in August 1962. T o think that he then continued in that noble profession until last De-cember is astonishing\u2014a total of more than 55 years. I was privileged to attend some of the best schools in the nation\u2014not just McKinney, but also the Air Force Academy and the University of Chicago. In my 22 years of formal education,I never had a better professor. \"Upon graduation, I wanted to be a tax lawyer. Although I never ac- tually had the opportunity to practice in that area, I know that I could have excelled at it\u2014all because of Larry. He had a teaching technique to assure that each student understood the point he was making. He would say, in that commanding voice of his, 'Do we agree, my friend?' And he would insist on an answer before moving on. \"We have lost a great and unforgettable man. Do we agree, my friends?\" Professor Jegen received the first Quality for Indiana T axpayers, Inc. tax award for outstanding dedication to the improvement of tax administration in Indiana in 1990; an international award from the Association of Continuing Legal Administrators for Excellence in Continuing Legal Education in 1990; and the Dr. John Morton-Finney, Jr. Excellence in Legal Education Award from the Indianapolis Bar Association in 2000. He was named a Sagamore of the Wabash by three different Indiana governors (Welsh, Whitcomb and Bowen) in 1964, 1972, and 1980 respectively; and was honored by the Indi-ana Senate in March 2015 with the passing of Senate Resolution 37 , which outlined the many highlights of his teaching career and his significant contributions to the profession. Professor Jegen received a bachelor's degree in philosophy and literature at Beloit College in 1956, a juris doctorate and a master's of business administration degree in accounting from the University of Michigan in 1960, and a Master of Laws degree in taxation from New Y ork University in 1963.
