Emily Weiss then launched one as part of her [Glossier](https://www.glossier.com/#!/products/soothing-face-mist) line, and the rest, as they say, is history. But recently, we've noticed a new form of the pretty-sounding liquid\u2014a kind you can actually drink. Yes, we've spotted bottles of rose water in the beverage aisles at chic grocery stores and gourmet marketplaces, and on the menu at snazzy juice bars here in New York City. Sounds kind of weird, huh? We thought so, too, which is why we did a little investigating. \"Rose water dates as far back as 1200 B.C. in the Mycenaean city of Pylos.

[Sakara](http://www.sakara.com/products/cb-sakara-beauty-water-1) was one of the first brands on our radar to produce a 100 percent natural rose water, and earlier this month, [Juice Press](https://juicepress.com/shop/juices/thirst-quenchers-shots/water-rose/) launched one, too. It's an interesting new product for these niche health brands, but it might become a normal thing to order at restaurants and bars. We discovered a brand called [Cilk](http://www.cilkrosewater.com/) that has a soon-to-launch rose-extract product (and a really beautiful If you're concerned about safety, Juice Press's chairman of the science advisory board, Kiril Petrov, ensures us that it's totally fine, per the FDA's acronym [GRAS](http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GRAS/), which literally stands for \"generally recognized as safe.\" (Yes, that's a thing.) \"Rose oil consists of several chemical components that have been proven to have direct antimicrobial functions and are GRAS for the use in food by the FDA. By decreasing the bad bacteria in our bodies we relieve some of the pressures of our immune system and we have a more balanced digestive system due to the decreased bacteria in our gut,\" he says. In short, rose water might not be quite as fun as ros\u00e9, but according to the pros, it's pretty darn good for you. By Kristie Dash, "}
