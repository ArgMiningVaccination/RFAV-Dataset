See [Requirements](#section3)for full details. - CAO Points 2021: 590* Course Outline Biomedical Scientists work in partnership with doctors and other health healthcare professionals in investigating samples of tissue and body fluids in order to diagnose diseases and monitor patient treatments. Biomedical Science is a continually changing dynamic profession and involves the study of diverse areas of medical science including biochemistry, microbiology, cellular pathology, haematology, and transfusion science. It provides training in cutting-edge technologies to facilitate the investigation of disease and medical research. You will have access to all the UCC and MTU facilities during this course, attending lectures, tutorials, and practical classes in both colleges. You will obtain detailed knowledge of the theory, principles, and application of methods in biomedical science and you will also learn to appreciate the importance of the medical scientist in providing a quality pathology service within a healthcare system. Importantly, you will learn how to assess, evaluate, and interpret clinical laboratory tests and results with a view to aiding in clinical diagnosis. A mixture of laboratory work, lectures, tutorials, and written and practical exams, will ensure that you are ready for the many different roles in medical laboratories.

Note that the modules for all courses are subject to change from year-to-year. For complete descriptions of individual modules, see the [Book of Modules](https://ucc-ie-public.courseleaf.com/modules/). Course Practicalities - This course is offered jointly with [Munster Technological University](http://www.cit.ie/). This collaboration blends the particular strengths of the two institutions. We have developed the Biomedical Science course jointly to improve the course structure and curriculum, your student experience and career opportunities. - Students are formally assessed through continuous assessment and end-of-semester examinations. A range of assessment methods are used and include: essay and short answer examinations, multiple-choice-question examinations, evaluations of laboratory practical skills, laboratory reports, independent laboratory research project, research mini-thesis and seminar presentation and oral examination. - Students on this BSc programme must obtain a course of occupational vaccinations for their safety. These will be coordinated and administered through the CIT/MTU Medical Centre but will be at a financial cost to the student. The current vaccination requirements are Hepatitis B (year 1) and both Hepatitis A and REVAXIS in year 2. The approximate combined cost for these vaccinations in the academic year 2019-2020 was \u20ac150. The vaccine requirements and costs are reviewed each year and may be subject to change. Why Choose This Course The aim of this course is to educate you in Biomedical Sciences, including the state-of-the-art technologies used in hospitals and research laboratories. It is offered jointly by UCC and Munster Technological University and approximately 35 places are available. Placement or Study Abroad Information Work Placement Upon completion of the BSc programme, you may progress to the postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Laboratory Practice which allows you to practice as a Medical Scientist in Ireland. This optional diploma takes one academic year to complete and incorporates a clinical work placement as part of its programme. Many of our students choose to take up a summer placement in laboratories in Ireland or abroad while completing their undergraduate BSc course. Placements have been carried out at the Cork Cancer Research Centre and across Europe via the acclaimed Amgen Scholars Programme. Skills and Careers Information Graduate Study Options As a graduate you can apply for entry to a wide range of postgraduate programmes, including Check out the School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology [Postgraduate Courses page](https://www.ucc.ie/en/biochemistry/postgraduatecoursesresearch-basedprogrammes/) to find out more. You could also complete a PhD and pursue a career in research. Career Opportunities Biomedical Science represents an opportunity to put scientific knowledge into practical use and perform a key role within medical healthcare. Biomedical scientists learn skills and gain qualifications that can be transferred all over Europe and can be recognised worldwide. As a Biomedical Science graduate, you can work in a wide variety of areas such as a medical scientist in Irish hospitals (BSc and Diploma required); biopharmaceutical biotechnology industries (BSc only required); public health (BSc only required); sales marketing of medical products (BSc only required). Our graduates have gone on to work in various fields and include analytical chemists, medical scientists, laboratory assistants, laboratory tutors and medical assistants. Companies and hospitals that employ graduates from this course include Alcon Laboratories, Bantry General Hospital, Bon Secours, Cork University Hospital, Galway Clinic, Health Service Executive (HSE), Mater Private Hospital, Mercy University Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, and University Hospital Limerick. To be eligible to work as a Biomedical Scientist in a hospital laboratory, you must hold a BSc Honours degree in Biomedical Science, followed by the postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Laboratory Placement. The degree, in conjunction with the clinical placement, is accredited by both the [Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine](https://www.acslm.ie/) and the [Institute of Biomedical Science](http://www.ibms.org), allowing you to work as a Biomedical Scientist in hospital laboratories in Ireland, the UK and elsewhere. Completion of both the BSc degree and the postgraduate diploma also allows you to register with CORU, the regulator of Medical Scientists in Ireland. The course prepares you for a career in laboratory medicine and related areas in the health care industry and the biopharmaceutical industry.
