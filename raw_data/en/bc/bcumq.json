You may need to do this if: a) You need to meet vaccination requirements for new Permanent Residence, Long-Term Pass and Work Pass applications, or renewals for Work Permit and S Pass holders in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors or residing in dormitories. b) You wish to receive additional doses under the National Vaccination Programme (NVP). - For passes issued by MOM, refer to [this page](https://www.mom.gov.sg/vac-reqmts) for more information. - You should have your vaccination history present in the NIR so that healthcare providers can determine if you are recommended to receive additional doses. - For more information on the NVP, refer to [this page](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs-on-getting-vaccinated). | ||What vaccines are accepted for ingestion in the NIR? | |A: || | Vaccines on the WHO EUL are accepted. These are: | | Manufacturer | | Name of Vaccine | | Pfizer/BioNTech | | BNT162b2/Comirnaty\u00ae | | Moderna | | mRNA-1273/Spikevax | | Novavax | | NVX-CoV2373/CovovaxTM/NuvaxovidTM | | Sinovac | | COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated/CoronavacTM | | Sinopharm | | SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated | | Astrazeneca | | Bharat Biotech | | Covaxin\u00ae | | CanSinoBIO | | Convidecia (AD5.CoV2-S [Recombinant]) | | Janssen | | Ad26.COV2-S | | Serum Institute of India | | CovishieldTM (ChAdOx1-S) All vaccination doses are accepted, regardless of how long ago they were taken. Combinations of different WHO EUL vaccines are also accepted. Please note that while your vaccination records may be accepted for ingestion, you may not be considered fully vaccinated by Singapore's standards, depending on your specific combination of doses and when they were taken. You may also wish to have your overseas infection records ingested, as this may count towards your vaccination status. | ||How can I get my overseas vaccination records ingested? | |A: || | If you have a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate (e.g. containing a QR code that can be scanned to verify its authenticity) You may visit any of the following locations to have your records verified and ingested: a) Selected Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) on Mondays to Fridays before 6.30pm To locate these JTVCs, please click - - JTVC Jurong West [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/jtvc) b) Any clinic that offers this as a service. - A non-exhaustive list of such clinics can be found [here](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/). Please call ahead to check if your preferred clinic offers this service and to book an appointment if needed. Please note that polyclinics do not provide this service. - Clinics will charge a fee for the time and manpower needed to provide this service and handle the ingestion of records. If you have a non-digitally verifiable vaccination certificate You may visit any clinic that offers such services to take a serology test before having your records ingested. The serology test is a means to confirm that you have undergone effective vaccination. - A non-exhaustive list of such clinics can be found [here](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/). Please call ahead to check if your preferred clinic offers this service and to book an appointment if needed. Please note that polyclinics do not provide this service. - Clinics will charge a fee for conducting the serology test and to handle the ingestion of records. | ||Which digitally verifiable vaccination certificates can be accepted for ingestion without the need for serology testing? | | A: ||A non-exhaustive list of recognised vaccination certificates is as follows: | If you possess a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate not found on this list, please provide the clinic with the necessary instructions on how to verify or authenticate the certificate. Such instructions may be obtained from the authority that issued your certificate. Given the wide variety of certificates and formats to keep track of, we seek your patience and understanding on this. - [Multiple countries] EU Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC) - [Australia] International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate - [Bahrain] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate - [Bangladesh] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare - [Brunei] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate on the BruHealth app - [Cambodia] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from the Kingdom of Cambodia - [Canada] Smart Health Card (SHC) issued by any Canadian province - [Mainland China] International Travel Health Certificate - [Fiji] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate - [Hong Kong] COVID-19 Vaccination Record from Department of Health - [India] Co-WIN International Travel Certificate - [Indonesia] International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from the PeduliLindungi app - [Japan] Vaccination Certificate of COVID-19 - [Republic of Korea] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency - [Macau] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from the Health Bureau of Macau - [Malaysia] Digital Certificate for COVID-19 Vaccination from the MySejahtera app - [Maldives] COVID-19 Digital Certification from the Health Protection Agency Maldives - [Myanmar] COVIDPass on the Zada app - [Philippines] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from Department of Health - [Qatar] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from Ministry of Public Health - [Saudi Arabia] COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from Tawakkalna app - [Sri Lanka] Certificate of COVID-19 Vaccination issued by the Sri Lanka Ministry of Health - [United States] SMART Health Card (SHC) or CDC Vaccination Card | ||What should I bring to the clinic to ingest my overseas vaccination records? | | A: ||Please bring along your personal identification documents (e.g. NRIC, FIN or passport) and overseas vaccination certificates, which can be in original hard copy or a digital copy. The certificates should clearly list your personal identifiers (e.g. full name, date of birth, passport number) and details of the vaccine doses you have taken (e.g. type of vaccine, date received). | Where applicable, you can also bring along documentation of a past infection (e.g. PCR test result, professionally-administered ART result, serology test result, discharge memo). If you do not have such documentation, you may have to take an anti-N serology test to confirm your past infection if you have not received an inactivated virus vaccine (i.e. vaccines such as Sinovac, Sinopharm and Covaxin). An anti-N serology test would be unable to ascertain your past infection if you had received an inactivated virus vaccine. If your documents are not in English, please have them translated by the embassy of the country that issued the document, a translation service provider, or a notary public. Please bring along both the original documents and the translated copies. | ||What do I need to do after visiting the clinic to ingest my overseas vaccination records? | | A: ||The clinic will submit your vaccination records into the NIR after they have been successfully verified. After which, it may take up to 24 hours for your vaccination status to be updated in our IT systems. | You may then view your vaccination records and/or vaccination status on the TraceTogether app and HealthHub app. (Note: Only Singpass users may access their vaccination records on HealthHub.) If you had taken a serology test, the clinic will need to receive the positive test result from the laboratory before submitting your vaccination records into the NIR. If you have issues with your vaccination status, you may file an enquiry using this [form](https://go.gov.sg/vds-query-form). | ||How can I check my vaccination records? | | A: ||You can view your vaccination records by logging in to the HealthHub app or the Notarise website using your Singpass account. All Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass Holders aged 15 years and above are eligible for Singpass. | If you are not a Singpass user, you can also log in to the [Notarise website](https://notarise.gov.sg) using your passport number, provided that your vaccinations were recorded with that passport number. Alternatively, you may refer to your physical vaccination card, which is given to all individuals vaccinated in Singapore. | ||My serology test result was negative. What do I need to do? | | A: ||A negative serology test result implies that the vaccination was not effective and may not protect well against severe illness if you contract COVID-19. Your vaccination records will not be ingested in the NIR. You are advised to re-take your vaccination in Singapore. | | ||Is it safe to re-take the COVID-19 vaccination if my serology test result is negative? | | A: ||There are no known safety issues with re-taking the COVID-19 vaccination. However, some may experience more noticeable side effects such as injection site pain, muscle aches and fever. | | ||Can I take a different brand of COVID-19 vaccine if I need to re-take the vaccination? | | A: ||Yes. | | ||Do I need to pay to re-take my vaccination in Singapore? | | A: ||Under the National Vaccination Programme, all Singaporeans and long-term residents are eligible to receive free COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters (more details |[here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination), or call the MOH COVID-19 Vaccination Hotline at 6995 9199).
