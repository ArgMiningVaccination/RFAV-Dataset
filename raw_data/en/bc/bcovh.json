Answer: Since the DNA is a hydrophilic molecule, it cannot pass through cell membranes, In order to force bacteria to take up the plasmid, the bacterial cells must first be made competent to take up DNA. This is done by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation such as calcium. Question 46. Write a brief note on Biolistics. Answer: The foreign DNA is coated onto the surface of minute gold or tungsten particles (1-3 pm) and bombarded onto the target tissue Or cells using a particle gun (also called as gene gun/micro projectile gun/shotgun). Then the bombarded cells or tissues are cultured on selected medium to regenerate plants from the transformed cells. Question 47. Agrobacterium - a natural genetic engineer of plants. Justify the statement. Answer: Among the various vectors used for plant transformation, the Ti-plasmid from Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been used extensively. This bacterium has a large size plasmid, known as Ti plasmid (Tumor inducing) and a portion of it referred as T-DNA (transfer DNA) is transferred to plant genome in the infected cells and cause plant tumors (crown gall). Since this bacterium has the natural ability to transfer T-DNA region of its plasmid into plant genome, upon infection of cells at the wound site, it is also known as the natural genetic engineer of plants. Question 48. Give a brief account on antibiotic resistant marker. Answer: An antibiotic resistance marker is a gene that produces a protein that provides cells with resistance to an antibiotic. Bacteria with transformed DNA can be identified by growing on a medium containing an antibiotic. Recombinants will grow on these medium as they contain genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as amphicillin, chloroamphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin, etc., while others may not be able to grow in these media, hence it is considered useful selectable marker. Question 49. Mention the types of Blotting techniques. Answer: Types of Blotting Techniques: - Southern Blotting: The transfer of DNA from agarose gels to nitrocellulose membrane. - Northern Blotting: The transfer of RNA to nitrocellulose membrane. - Western Blotting: Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane: Question 50. CRISPR - Cas9. Answer: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9. Question 51. What is RNA interference (RNAi)? How it is carried out? Answer: RNA interference is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation. This is done by neutralising targeted mRNA molecules. A simplified model for the RNAi pathway is based on two steps, each involving ribonuclease enzyme. In the first step, the trigger RNA (either dsRNA or miRNA primary transcript) is processed into a short interfering RNA (siRNA) by the RNase II enzymes called Dicer and Drosha. In the second step, siRNAs are loaded into the effector complex RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The siRNA is unwound during RISC assembly and the single- stranded RNA hybridizes with mRNA target. This RNAi is seen in plant feeding nematodes. Question 52. Prepare a protocol for Glyphosphate resistant potato plant development. Answer: Question 53. How Bt cotton crops are developed? Answer: Bt cotton is a genetically modified organism (GMO) or genetically modified pest resistant plant cotton variety, which produces an insecticide activity to bollworm. Strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce over 200 different Bt toxins, each harmful to different insects. Most Bt toxins are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, cotton bollworms and gatflies but are harmless to other forms of life.The genes are encoded for toxic crystals in the Cry group of endotoxin. When insects attack and eat the cotton plant the Cry toxins are dissolved in the insect's stomach.The epithelial membranes of the gut block certain vital nutrients thereby sufficient regulation of potassium ions are lost in the insects and results in the death of epithelial cells in the intestine .membrane which leads to the death of the larvae. Question 54. Comment on Golden rice. Answer: Golden rice is a variety of Oryza sativa (rice) produced through genetic engineering of biosynthesized beta-carotene, a precursor ofVitamin-A in the edible parts of rice developed by - Ingo Potrykus and his group. The aim is to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary Vitamin-A, which kills so many children under five year age. Golden rice differs from its parental strain by the addition of three beta-carotene biosynthesis , genes namely and soil Erwinia cyclase) gene from wild-type rice endosperm of normal rice, does not contain beta-carotene. Golden-rice has been genetically altered so that the endosperm now accumulates Beta-carotene. This has been done using Recombinant DNA technology. Golden rice can control childhood blindness - Xerophthalmia. Question 55. Name any 3 bacterial species used to polyhydroxybutyrates (PHB). Answer: Bacillus megaterium. Corynebacterium glutamicum. note Green fluorescent protein. Answer: The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a protein containing 238 amino acid residues of 26.9 kDa that exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to blue to ultraviolet range (395 nm). GFP refers to the protein first isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. GFP is an excellent tool in biology due to its ability to form internal chromophore without requiring any accessory cofactors, gene products, enzymes or substrates other than molecular oxygen. In cell and molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently used as a reporter of expression. It has been used in modified forms to make biosensors. Question 57. How turmeric biopiracy is prevented by Indian Government? Answer: The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in the year 1995 granted patent to the method of use of turmeric as an antiseptic agent. Turmeric has been used by the Indians as a home remedy for the quick healing of the wounds and also for purpose of healing rashes. The journal article published by the Indian Medical Association, in the year 1953 wherein this remedy was mentioned. Therefore, in this way it was proved that the use of turmeric as an antiseptic is not new to the world and is not a new invention, but formed a part of the traditional knowledge of the Indians. The objection in this case US patent and trademark office was upheld and traditional knowledge of the Indians was protected. 5 - Mark Questions Question 58. Describe the steps involved in recombinant DNA technology. Answer: The steps involved in recombinant DNA technology are: - Isolation of a DNA fragment containing a gene of interest that needs to be cloned. This is called an insert. - Generation of recombinant DNA (rDNA) molecule by insertion of the DNA fragment into a carrier molecule called a vector that can self-replicate within the host cell. - Selection of the transformed host cells that is carrying the rDNA and allowing them to multiply thereby multiplying the rDNA molecule. The - entire process thus generates either a large amount of rDNA or a large amount of protein expressed by the insert. - Wherever vectors are not involved the desired gene is multiplied by PCR technique. The multiple copies are. injected into the host cell protoplast or it is shot into the host cell protoplast by shot gun method. Question 59. Explain in detail about various ty pes of direct gene transfer method, Answer: a. Chemical mediated gene transfer: Certain chemicals like polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran sulphate induce DNA uptake into plant protoplasts. b. Microinjection: The DNA is directly injected into the Electric field induces a voltage across cell membrane nucleus using fine tipped glass needle or micro pipette Electroporation Methods of Gene Transfer to transform plant cells. The protoplasts are immobilised on a solid support (agarose on a microscopic slide) or held with a holding pipette under suction. c. Electroporation Methods of Gene Transfer: Apulse of high voltage is applied to protoplasts, cells or tissues which makes transient pores in the plasma membrane through which uptake of foreign DNA occurs. d. Liposome mediated method of Gene Transfer: Liposomes the artificial phospholipid vesicles are useful in gene transfer. The gene or DNA is transferred from liposome into vacuole of plant cells. It is carried out by encapsulated DNA into the vacuole. This technique is advantageous because the liposome protects the introduced DNA from being damaged by the acidic pH and protease enzymes present in the vacuole. Liposome and tonoplast of vacuole fusion resulted in gene transfer. This process is called lipofection. e. Biolistics: The foreign DNA is coated onto the surface of minute gold or tungsten particles (1-3 pm) and bombarded onto the target tissue or cells using a particle gun (also called as gene gun/micro projectile gun/shotgun). Then the bombarded cells or tissues are cultured on selected medium to regenerate plants from the transformed cells. Question 60. Describe the procedure of Blue-White colony selection methods. Answer: Blue- White Colony Selection Method is a powerful method used for screening of recombinant plasmid. In this method, a reporter gene lacZ is inserted in the vector. The lacZ encodes the enzyme P-galactosidase and contains several recognition sites for restriction enzyme.P-galactosidase breaks a synthetic substrates called X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl- P-D- galacto-pyranoside) into an insoluble blue coloured product. If a foreign gene is inserted into lacZ, this gene will be inactivated. Therefore, no-blue colour will develop (white) because P-galactosidase is not synthesized due to inactivation of lacZ. Therefore, the host cell containing r-DNA form white coloured colonies on the medium contain X-gal, whereas the other cells containing non-recombinant DNA will develop the blue coloured colonies. On the basis of colony colour, the recombinants can be selected. Question 61. Write a note on Replica plating technique. Answer: A technique in which the pattern of colonies growing on a culture plate is copied. A sterile filter plate is pressed against the culture plate and then lifted. Then the filter is pressed against a second sterile culture plate. This results in the new plate being infected with cell in the same - relative positions as the colonies in the original plate. Usually, the medium used in the second plate will differ from that used in the first. It may include an antibiotic or without a growth factor. In this way, transformed cells can be selected. Replica plating technique Question 62. How Agarose Gel Electrophoresis is performed? Answer: 1. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis is used mainly for the purification of specific DNA fragments. Agarose is convenient for separating DNA fragments ranging in size from a few hundred to about 20000 base pairs. Polyacrylamide is preferred for the purification of smaller DNA fragments. 2. The gel is complex network of polymeric molecules. DNA molecule is negatively charged molecule - under an electric field DNA molecule migrates through the gel. The electrophoresis is frequently performed with marker DNA fragments of known size which allow accurate size 3. determination of an unknown DNA molecule by interpolation. The advantages of agarose gel electrophoresis are that the DNA bands can be readily detected at high sensitivity. The bands of DNA in the gel are stained with the dye Ethidium Bromide and DNA can be detected 4. as visible fluorescence illuminated in UV light will give orange fluorescence, which can be photographed. Question 63. Explain the procedure of Southern Blotting Technique. Southern Blotting Techniques - DNA Answer: The transfer of denatured DNA from Agarose gel to Nitrocellulose Blotting or Filter Paper technique was introduced by Southern in 1975 and this technique is called Southern Blotting Technique. Steps: The transfer of DNA from agarose gel to nitrocellulose filter paper is achieved by Capillary Action. A buffer Sodium Saline Citrate (SSC) is used, in which DNA is highly soluble, it can be drawn up through the gel into the Nitrocellulose membrane. By this process ss-DNA becomes 'Trapped' in the membrane matrix. This DNA is hybridized with a nucleic acid and can be detected by autoradiography. Autoradiography - A technique that captures the image formed in a photographic emulsion due to emission of light or radioactivity from a labelled component placed together with unexposed film.
