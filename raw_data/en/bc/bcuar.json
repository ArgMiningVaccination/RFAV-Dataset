Visiting Hours and Guidelines Family and friends are an important part of the patient care experience and we encourage you to have family and friends visit you during your stay at Los Angeles General Medical Center. The hospital's general visiting hours are 11:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M., although some unit visiting hours may vary, as listed below. Visitors are limited to two at any one time, unless specific exceptions are authorized by the patient's provider. LA General Medical Center is a smoke-free campus for the health and wellness of our patients, staff, and visitors. Smoking is prohibited on the campus, including parking lots. Intensive Care Units Visitors may visit at any time during visiting hours, but visits are limited to 10 minutes at a time, unless approved otherwise. Children under the age of 12 years may visit patients in the ICU at the request of the patient and if they are supervised by an adult. Visitors may be asked to leave the unit during medical emergencies or procedures involving any patient in the Unit, and/or during clinical rounds or if having visitors will negatively affect the patient's care. Please check with the ICU staff before entering a patient's room to make sure the patient is stable to receive visitors. Pediatric Wards Visiting hours for Pediatric inpatients are 24 hours a day for parents and grandparents. One parent or guardian may stay overnight. For all other visitors, visiting is from 10:00 A.M. - 9:00 P.M. All visitors to Pediatric patients must be approved by the patient's parents or guardian. The patient's parent or guardian may identify other visitors who may stay overnight with the patient, as long as that person is over 21 years old and prior arrangements have been made with the nurse. Visitors or siblings under the age of 18 may not stay at the bedside overnight. Infection Prevention The safety of patients is our top priority. Visitors should take precautions to prevent the transmission of infection by following these steps: - Visitors who are sick are encouraged to stay home; - Visitors should clean their hands when entering the hospital by washing them or using hand sanitizer gel. Hand sanitizer wipes are located in the lobby; - Wash hands or use hand sanitizer gel prior to and after patient contact; - Cover mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. "}
