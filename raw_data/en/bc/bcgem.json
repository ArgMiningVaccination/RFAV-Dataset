In Aurora Research Institute's Discovery Laboratory, the goal is to find innovative ways to improve patient outcomes for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. More simply put, the goal is to discover cures. To facilitate this research, the institute transformed over 14,000 square feet on the Aurora Sinai Medical Center campus as part of a more than $5 million capital investment. The innovative transformation includes a unique laboratory environment, small animal facility and offices. Where revolutionary research is happening Efficient, artistic The space-saving layout of Discovery Laboratory features shared work stations and communal core equipment. This efficient design avoids duplication found in traditional pod-like laboratories and enhances communication among researchers. The tissue processing and microscopy area is equipped for preparation, staining and analysis of slides. Typically this service is outsourced, which would add cost and time to research projects. An enclosed area at biosafety level 2 allows for genetic manipulation using viruses and other microorganisms to develop new immunotherapies. A refrigerated room allows for cold- temperature experiments. A separate room houses deep freeze cryogenic equipment for storage of tissues, cells and supplies at -20, -80 and -150 degrees. Rounding out the laboratory are traditional human and animal cell and tissue preparation and culture spaces. And don't forget to look up. A barrel vault ceiling features an artistic DNA sequence design.

Shadow opportunities11 Aurora Research Institute | Annual Report 2015 Caregivers who care In a variety of ways, Aurora Research Institute caregivers support organizations with missions to change lives for the better. Aurora Health Care Foundation Through Aurora Health Care Foundation's 2015 Aurora Partnership Campaign, institute caregivers embraced the giving spirit, contributing more than $17,500 to a variety of public agencies, including about $11,350 to Aurora-specific funds. Available during October and November, the campaign provides a way for Aurora caregivers to support internal and external charitable funds. The institute's ongoing partnership with Aurora's foundation also benefitted the neonatal intensive care unit at Aurora Sinai Medical Center with a Tradition of Caring event sponsorship and raised awareness about the translational research being conducted in the newly opened Discovery Laboratory. Taking strides to fight disease Tackling cancer in Milwaukee and Green Bay, institute caregivers, family and friends raised $950 for the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation through its Lombardi Walks/Runs in June. A beneficiary of the Lombardi foundation, the institute also helped sponsor the Vince Lombardi Award of Excellence Dinner Ball in April. Institute caregivers, family and friends raised $544 for the American Heart Association through its 2015 Milwaukee Heart and Stroke Walk/Fun Run on Sept. 20 at Veterans Park, Milwaukee. Fundraising activities included an inaugural basket raffle. Providing a community benefit, the institute Adopt-a-student program Participating in Aurora Sinai Medical Center's Adopt-A-Student program, institute caregivers in December fulfilled holiday wishes of warm clothes, action figures, dolls and more for 16 students who attend Hawthorne Elementary School.

Some of the prestigious scientific journals include JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, PLoS One, Circulation Research, Expert Review of Cardiovascular Therapy, Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology and Cardiology in Review, and esteemed society meetings of the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and American Society of Chest Physicians.Publications/presentations team of scientists, associates and assistants are studying the molecular basis for the aging heart's decreased ability to tolerate stress and increased susceptibility to injury and heart rhythm disorders. 10 published manuscripts 11 published abstracts (Below) Senior research scientist Scarlet Shi, PhD, presents some of her cardiovascular research findings during the open house celebration of Discovery Laboratory.(Left) Research associate Kelsey Kraft works in the newly opened Discovery Laboratory on the Aurora Sinai Medical Center campus.aurora.org/research 14Intramural funding Through new and continued projects, CIRCA researchers were awarded $230,000 in intramural funding through the Cardiac and Cardiovascular Surgery research award programs. Research scientist Larisa Emelyanova, PhD, hopes to determine why a drug that helps people with atrial fibrillation can be harmful in patients with heart failure and how this detrimental effect can be avoided by pretreatment with another drug. The study is supported by a new 2015 Cardiac Research Award.With a new 2015 Cardiovascular Surgery Research Award, research scientist Gracious Ross, PhD, is studying a targeted approach to reducing calcium loading in cardiac fibroblast cells obtained from patients undergoing open heart surgery. The goal of this research is to find a way to slow the progression of heart failure. Effective ways to prevent cardiovascular dysfunction are not available. Results of animal testing cannot always be translated to patient care as those methods do not completely reproduce the human condition. A lack of cardiac tissue from patients for research purposes is another barrier. A new approach to studying the biology of cardiovascular disease involves reengineering, or inducing, cells from tissue donated by adult patients into pluripotent stem cells, which is an embryonic-like state. From these iPS cells, researchers can grow cardiac cells that contain genetic information, including the mutation that causes disease. This \"disease-in-a-dish\" approach allows researchers to study cardiovascular disease biology and different therapies to correct abnormalities that cause cellular dysfunction. Rosy Joshi-Mukherjee, PhD, a new CIRCA research scientist, has launched an innovative research program to define the underlying causes of abnormal heart function and test therapies in miniature beating hearts Research associate Ulugbek Negmadjanov, MD, received the New Investigator Award at the annual Clinical Research Recognition Event. The award recognizes new researchers with less than two years of service at Aurora who show success with a research project and potential for growth in the research community. (Above) Research associate Stacie Edwards uses a centrifuge while studying stem cells. (Below) Research scientist Rosy Joshi-Mukherjee, PhD, obtains stem cells from a freezer.CIRCA launches new induced pluripotent stem cell program grown from iPS cells. Initially, Dr. Joshi- Mukherjee will focus on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick and affects how the heart functions. In patients with particular genetic abnormalities, this precision medicine initiative may help reduce progression of their heart condition and prevent development of the disease in affected family members.Stud y highlight15 Aurora Research Institute | Annual Report 2015Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has emerged as a minimally invasive approach to treat heart valve disease. Aurora engaged in early clinical trials to test the approach using Medtronic Inc.'s CoreValve - the only health system in Wisconsin to do so - and was the first in the state to implant the prosthetic valve after it received Food and Drug Administration approval. CoreValve has since gained FDA approval for use in patients who have previously received a tissue valve and are in need of a second one. Despite its success, complications persist. In collaboration with Marquette University, Setu Trivedi, DO, is laying the groundwork for a predictive model based on anatomical variations to determine which patients will have the best outcomes with the procedure. Dr. Trivedi received a nearly $30,000 grant from the Sullivan Cardiac Research Award for Residents and Fellows for this work. Tanvir Bajwa, MD, and Arshad Jahangir, MD, are serving as mentors to Dr. Trivedi.Complication prediction modelAward highlightFunded projects Researchers are like gardeners. Their hypothesis is the seed. And Aurora Research Institute's internal grant program is like a starter pot. Funding from the program gives researchers an initial boost that spurs future, larger projects with the goal of benefitting patients and the community.In 2015, the institute awarded $498,239 through the Sullivan Cardiac Research Award for Residents and Fellows, Cardiac Research Award and Cardiovascular Surgery Research Award to 10 Aurora Health Care investigators to conduct cardiac-related research.

They donated $1 million to support the cardiovascular research of interventional cardiologist Tanvir Bajwa, MD, via the fellowship program.aurora.org/research 16Since starting with Aurora Health Care as director of the Advanced Heart Failure Therapies program in 2013, Vinay Thohan, MD, has launched several investigator-initiated projects with funding - totaling nearly $150,000 - from both internal and external sources. A nearly $50,000 grant from a Cardiovascular Surgery Research Award will support collaborative efforts to understand how the ratio of omega-3 and -6 fatty acids in tissue and fat stores on the outer layer of the heart may contribute to coronary heart disease. This work could lead to greater understanding of coronary heart disease changes to dietary recommendations to prevent this disease. Completing work started for a separate Cardiovascular Surgery Research Award received in 2014 with nearly $50,000 in additional funds, Dr. Thohan is working to identify clinical factors that may predict the development of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). The purpose of the study is to improve the selection criteria for patients and develop a better understanding of the risks for patients who receive an LVAD as lifesaving therapy. A third project supported by the Greater Milwaukee Foundation with a nearly $50,000 grant is targeting how best to stratify the risk among patients with heart disease who undergo noncardiac surgery. This study may lead to a readily available risk-stratifying tool and interventions that lower risk so patients can undergo surgeries safely.

However, warfarin is challenging to prescribe as it works well for some people, but causes harm in others. With $50,000 support from a Cardiovascular Surgery Research Award grant, senior research scientist Kourosh Ravvaz, MD, PhD, is leading an investigator-initiated precision medicine study to develop a model that will help physicians predict the quality of warfarin therapy in patients undergoing heart valve surgery. To create and test the prediction model, Dr. Ravvaz and his research team are combining data from Aurora's electronic health record system with genetic data from blood samples stored in the Biorepository and Specimen Resource Center. Working with investigators at Harvard Medical School and University of Minnesota, Dr. Ravvaz is simultaneously trying to further efforts to personalize warfarin therapy while Kourosh Ravvaz, MD, PhD, presents the goals of a collaborative study with Harvard Medical School and University of Minnesota that will personalize warfarin therapy across different populations. Dr. Ravvaz received $120,000 to conduct this research at Aurora Health Care. comparing the effectiveness of multiple protocols across different populations. Through this collaboration, Dr. Ravvaz received $120,000 from Harvard's National Institutes of Health grant to serve as principal investigator of this multiyear study at Aurora Health Care.17 Aurora Research Institute | Annual Report 2015Clinical trial coordinator Marilyn Miller, RN, explains the registry trial that will track short- and long-term outcomes of the noninvasive AlloMap test to a potential subject during the informed consent process.Patients who receive a transplanted heart, or an allograft, require long-term monitoring for possible organ rejection. The current standard of care calls for invasive biopsies every month or every other month during the first year and biannually thereafter to monitor for organ rejection. Principal investigator Nasir Sulemanjee, MD, is tracking short- and long-term outcomes for CareDx Inc.'s AlloMap test, a noninvasive option to avoid the risks and discomforts associated with the biopsy procedure (OAR, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01833195). Aurora Registry tracks outcomes of rejection monitoring test The goal is to enroll about 2,000 subjects and assess them for five years.Does implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator require an overnight stay or is it safe to go home the same day? This is a question Indrajit Choudhuri, MD, wanted to answer so he partnered with Ranjit Suri, MD, of Heart Rhythm Associates of New York as national principal investigators and secured St. Jude Medical Inc. as the sponsor (SDD for ICD, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01993862).Physician leads nationwide trial on same-day discharge Nearly 30 sites enrolled more than 260 subjects receiving an ICD for primary prevention against sudden cardiac death. Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center was the only recruitment site in Wisconsin. This trial was the first of its kind to clarify that there are no significant differences in complications with either discharge strategy, be it same or next day. Patients readily accepted being discharged on the same day as their procedure. The findings will be presented at the Heart Rhythm Society annual scientific session. Data collection on patient outcomes continues.Phyllis Runningen, BSN, is serving as site coordinator. Image courtesy of St. Jude Medical Inc. St. Luke's Medical Center is the only recruitment site in the state. Subjects provide a blood sample at the same intervals as for the biopsy procedure. Gene expression of immune system cells are profiled using the AlloMap method, which has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration. This registry trial builds on a previous trial that found the AlloMap test to be comparable to biopsy. The goal is to enroll about 2,000 subjects and assess them for five years.

CoreValve\u00ae Transcatheter Aortic Valve System (Medtronic) Expanding the uses for CoreValve, the Food and Drug Administration in March 2015 approved the valve-in-valve indication for patients who previously had their aortic valve surgically replaced and need a replacement. CoreValve, implanted via a minimally invasive transcatheter approach, also is approved for patients who are not candidates for surgery. First in the state to implant the artificial aortic valve through a clinical trial, Aurora researchers Tanvir Bajwa, MD, and Daniel O'Hair, MD, continue to study additional uses at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center, the only recruiting site in Wisconsin for these trials. Michelle Bennett, RN, Kelly Magee, MSN, Deb Waller, BSN, and Wendy Schmidt, RN, are part of the team that supports transcatheter aortic valve replacement trials. Evera MRI (Medtronic) Approved by the FDA in September 2015, the Evera MRI is the world's first implantable cardioverter-defibrillator safe for use with magnetic resonance imaging. Atul Bhatia, MD, served as principal investigator at Aurora St. Luke's, the only recruiting site in Wisconsin for the international trial. Anthony Chambers, BSN, served as site coordinator. Praluent (Sanofi U.S.) Stephen Welka, MD, is serving as principal investigator at Aurora Memorial Hospital of Burlington for a multicenter trial that resulted in FDA approval of Praluent (alirocumab) injection in July 2015. Praluent is the first cholesterol-lowering treatment approved in a new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Carol Feldhausen, BSN, serves as site coordinator WATCHMAN (Boston Scientific Corp.) Providing the first-of-its-kind alternative to long-term warfarin therapy for stroke risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, Boston Scientific Corp. in March 2015 received FDA approval for its WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device. Jasbir Sra, MD, and Tanvir Bajwa, MD, serve as principal investigators at Aurora St. Luke's for the two clinical trials. Anthony Chambers, BSN, serves as site coordinator.FDA approvals Not all patients are eligible for minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Many patients still require open heart surgery to replace diseased aortic valves. David Kress, MD, is leading a clinical trial to study Medtronic Inc.'s Model 400 aortic valve bioprosthesis at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center, the only recruiting site in Wisconsin (PERIGON, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02088554). As part of the Phase III international clinical trial, Dr. Kress is studying the safety and effectiveness of the Researchers study safety, effectiveness of bioprosthetic valve investigational valve in the treatment of subjects with moderate or greater aortic stenosis, which is narrowing of the valve, or regurgitation, in which blood flows in the reverse direction. No more than 1,300 subjects will receive the valve at about 40 sites throughout the United States, Europe and Canada. Researchers will assess the subjects for five years after implant with regard to valve-related adverse events and death. Jennifer Cooper, BSN, is serving as site coordinator.When a person's heart is unable to contract normally, it can't pump with enough force to circulate blood adequately. These patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function face possible complications or death when they undergo surgery to repair it. Frank Downey, MD, is leading a clinical trial at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center, the only recruitment site in Wisconsin, to study the effectiveness of an investigational drug levosimendan (Tenax Therapeutics Inc.) in improving outcomes after subjects with left ventricular systolic dysfunction undergo cardiac surgery (LEVO-CTS, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02025621).Trial tests whether investigational drug reduces adverse events The purpose of this Phase III clinical trial is to validate the drug's safety and effectiveness to fulfill this unmet need in the United States. Researchers plan to enroll an estimated 760 patients at about 60 sites in the U.S. and Canada. Jennifer Cooper, BSN, is serving as site coordinator.

When he was 55, Craig Hummer, 57, of Muskego suffered a major stroke caused by a hole between the top two chambers of his heart, otherwise known as a patent foramen ovale. \"Apparently I've had this condition since I was born,\" Hummer said. To correct it and reduce his chances of a future stroke, he decided with support from his wife Kimberly to pursue a clinical trial studying the safety and effectiveness of a septal occluder device produced by W. L. Gore & Associates (clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT00738894). \"He took a chance not only for himself, but for all of us to try something new, a new treatment that hadn't been Angel or hero?

Nationwide, researchers enrolled 664 subjects, testing the device plus stroke prevention drugs against the drugs alone for prevention of future strokes. Hummer, who remains involved in the study for about four more years, said he is \"back to 100 percent, which is rare for that severe of a stroke.\" For his willingness to participate in a clinical trial - or get his hands dirty as he put it - Aurora Research Institute in September recognized Hummer with the 2015 Subject Hero Award. During his acceptance speech, Hummer thanked the caregivers at Aurora St. Luke's from the \"top\" of his heart. Hummer's experience should not be used to predict outcomes of the clinical trial.

Incorporating APN Health LLC, Dr. Sra brought together scientists and engineers from all over the word to work over this unique concept over the last four years. The first product developed by an Aurora Health Care physician to receive FDA clearance, Navik 3D TM can be used to create 3D maps of the cardiac chamber of interest, pinpointing the exact locations of catheters and guiding them to specific points in the heart to treat arrhythmias. It is the first cardiac mapping system that does not require specialized equipment, using existing patient monitoring and fluoroscopic imaging systems in hospital labs. \"FDA clearance of Navik 3D represents a major milestone,\" said Dr. Sra. \"We are proud that we've been able to develop a cost-effective and simple technology that will allow physicians throughout the world to more easily, accurately and confidently complete their procedures.\" With backing from Aurora and support from Aurora Research Institute, the new technology builds on their commitment to innovation.\"Aurora Health Care and the Aurora Research Institute are proud to support the work of Dr. Sra and his talented team in the development of this leading-edge technology that will ultimately better treat patients with heart irregularities,\" said Randall Lambrecht, PhD, president of the institute. \"Dr. Sra is a pioneer in his understanding of heart arrhythmias and we were thrilled to see the FDA clearance of Navik 3D.\" APN Health contracted with Aurora to conduct the necessary studies to obtain FDA clearance. The collaboration included approval by Aurora's institutional review board to allow testing that helped develop the software. Going forward APN Health has contracted with Aurora to conduct patient studies for further improvement before the device sees widespread clinical use. The technology is anchored by a growing portfolio of patented intellectual property. \"Our proprietary digital image processing techniques and algorithms provide us with a remarkable platform from which to provide even greater functionality for electrophysiologists,\" Dr. Sra said. The first product developed by an Aurora Health Care physician to receive FDA clearance Navik 3D can be used to create three-dimensional maps of the cardiac chamber of interest, pinpointing the exact locations of catheters and guiding them to specific points in the heart to treat arrhythmias. Internationally recognized cardiac electrophysiologist Jasbir Sra, MD, works with manager of cardiology research David Krum, MS, to test the Navik 3D cardiac mapping system.

Translational Oncology Research: Quest for Understanding & Exploration (TORQUE) spans the spectrum from survivorship to clinical and lab-based research. Under the TORQUE umbrella, researchers study the effects of exercise after cancer treatment through Team Phoenix. Employing a \"bedside-to-bench\" approach, TORQUE scientists leverage patient data in the electronic health record against tissue and blood samples in the Biorepository and Specimen Resource Center at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center TORQUE for longitudinal epidemiological and biomarker analyses. Based at Aurora Sinai Medical Center, Dr. Tjoe collaborates internally with researchers in the Discovery Laboratory to study ways to trigger the patient's own immune system response to fight cancer. Externally, she works with biotechnology companies to better understand how cancer develops, discover biomarkers and develop new targeted drug therapies.

Notably, Dr. Tjoe et al. standardized best-practice care throughout Aurora Health Care by evaluating breast cancer diagnostic practices. The evaluation led to collaboration among surgeons and radiologists to make minimally invasive biopsy the diagnostic modality of choice systemwide. Her poster presentation on the study at the American College of Surgeons 2014 Clinical Congress was recognized as the Faculty Presentation of the Year by Aurora University of Wisconsin Medical Group. The findings were later published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons and Dr. Tjoe was interviewed about the study for a MedicalResearch.com article.Publications/presentations 2 published manuscripts 2 published abstracts Brittany Last and Christian Donohoe, BSN, discuss a subject enrolled in multiple breast cancer clinical trials. Tom Smith and John Richards, PhD, analyze breast cancer cells using flow cytometry in the newly opened Discovery Laboratory. Flow cytometry is a core feature of the new lab.Meaningful breast cancer research requires the focused energies of invested patients, clinicians, scientists and industry to create forward-moving scientific momentum. This collaborative atmosphere includes TORQUE researchers and industry partner Stemcentrx Inc. using residual tissue donated by patients to study the molecular makeup of tumor cells in avatars, which improves understanding about how cancer develops, allows discovery of genetic biomarkers and spurs development of new targeted drug therapies. Breast cancer survivor Ruby Stommel, 71, of West Bend was willing to contribute her residual tissue after approached by certified clinical research coordinator Brittany Last. \"What good was it doing me?\" Stommel asked. \"And if I could help someone and save them the grief that we went through?

Led by Judy Tjoe, MD, and cancer rehabilitation specialist Leslie Waltke, DPT, patients train under medical guidance for a triathlon, learning best practices for removing physical and psychological barriers for initiating and maintaining a regular exercise routine after cancer treatment. Exercise physiologists and cardiologists are working collaboratively to study Ruby Stommel on tissue donation: \"... if I could help someone and save them the grief that we went through?

Immunology and endocrinology researchers John Richards, PhD, and Hershel Raff, PhD, together with collaborators at Marquette are investigating ways to improve quality of life by reducing cancer-related fatigue in patients who have undergone treatment. Studies conducted by TORQUE researchers are supported by generous donors. In 2015, Team Phoenix received $25,000 from Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. Quite the gem A giving woman, Stommel hopes to get back to her volunteerism, pushing wheelchairs at the local hospital and playing games with residents at a nearby assisted living facility. Her tissue is a valuable gift as it may contain hidden clues - genetic biomarkers - that could lead researchers to predict which patients are susceptible to progression from noninvasive to invasive disease. This knowledge may result in less use of radiation, avoidance of potential side effects and prevention of unnecessary surgery to remove one or both breasts. Without this knowledge, patients choose to avoid the risk of recurrence. \"Choosing a bilateral mastectomy ultimately was my decision,\" Stommel said. \"I didn't want to take a chance of cancer coming back.\" TORQUE researchers continue to search for these biomarkers and develop genetic tests through additional partnerships with Genentech Inc., Rock River Cancer Research Foundation, Celcuity LLC and others.Effects of exercise posttreatment: Team Phoenix survivorship program Patient spotlight Team PHOENIX Survivorship Rede/f_ined Leslie Waltke, DPT, and Judy Tjoe, MD, lead the Team Phoenix breast cancer survivorship program in which patients train under medical guidance for a triathlon.27 Aurora Research Institute | Annual Report 2015Early Phase Cancer Research Program Led by medical research director Michael Thompson, MD, PhD, the Early Phase Cancer Research Program is gaining momentum at Aurora Health Care. Ten early phase cancer clinical trials received initial Institutional Review Board approval in 2015, a testament to the program's mission to provide more early (Phase I and II) therapeutic clinical trials offering the latest options for patients with cancer. Based on statistical power, Phase I trials evaluate safety and Phase II assess how well investigational treatments work before they can be tested against the current standard of care (Phase III trials). In the four years prior to Dr. Thompson joining Aurora in 2013, two to three early phase cancer clinical trials, on average, received IRB approval a year. That number increased to 12 in 2013, 8 in 2014 and 10 in 2015.

C linical trial spotlight Testing the theory that therapy designed for each individual's tumor will improve outcomes, Aurora Health Care in 2015 joined a multicenter Phase II clinical trial that uses genetic testing to guide chemotherapy prescription in patients who did not respond to treatment before surgery and have residual breast cancer after surgery. Sponsored by Bryan Schneider, MD, of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, the goal of the trial is to compare two-year survival rates of subjects treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with and without the information genetic testing can provide (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02101385). Researchers from about 25 study locations plan to enroll more than 130 subjects. Principal investigator Michael Thompson, MD, PhD, is leading the research at Aurora Health Care. Subjects with residual breast cancer after surgery who are randomized to genetically directed therapy will receive one of 12 different types of chemotherapy based on their molecular biomarkers, indicators that may predict which treatment will best work against that particular person's tumor.aurora.org/research 28Institute gives nearly $200,000 in start-up boosts for cancer-related research studies Aurora Research Institute awarded $194,360 through the Aurora Cancer Care Research Award to seven Aurora Health Care investigators to conduct cancer-related research.

Hematologist oncologist Cheruppolil Santhosh-Kumar, MD, is assessing the impact of outpatient family conferences on quality of life and satisfaction of patients with advanced cancer using $25,000 support from an Aurora Cancer Care Research Award grant. The Vince Lombardi Cancer Clinic in Sheboygan is the pilot site for the study. Attending the family conferences are the oncologist, a nurse navigator, a social worker, an occupational therapist, the patient and loved ones. During the conferences, patients learn about different aspects of palliative care. The purpose is to improve patients' understanding of prognosis and treatment expectations and assess effectiveness of communication between the care team and family and between the patient and family. The goals are to reduce suffering for patients with advanced cancer and to offer a model for other institutions to follow in dealing with such sensitive topics. Dr. Santhosh-Kumar presented preliminary findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2015 Palliative Care in Oncology Symposium in October.

However, this surgery often affects kidney function, preventing patients from receiving chemotherapy after surgery. Rubina Qamar, MD, is leading a clinical trial at sites throughout Aurora Health Care to test an investigational approach to aggressive urinary tract cancer of initiating chemotherapy prior to surgery (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02412670). This National Cancer Institute Phase II trial is sponsored by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) Cancer Research Group. Researchers are testing whether chemotherapy before surgery, when the kidneys are at peak performance, may be more effective in killing or stopping the growth or division of tumor cells. Blood, urine and tumor specimen from the about 60 patients to be enrolled will be evaluated for potential markers of chemotherapy response or resistance. Researchers are studying initiation of chemotherapy prior to surgery.One and not quite done: Patient agrees to be followed for clinical trial A new option for treating early stage breast cancer, available in Wisconsin only at Aurora BayCare Medical Center, provides select patients with one targeted dose of radiation during surgery rather than the traditional method of 33 doses over the course of more than six weeks. As part of a national clinical trial, William Owens, MD, is leading the research at Aurora BayCare to treat select patients with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) and then follow the patients for complications and breast cancer recurrence (TARGIT-US, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01570998). Opting for the new treatment, Mary Blashka, 67, of Manitowoc agreed to enroll in the registry trial, which requires physical examinations at least every six months for three years and yearly at four and five years post-treatment. \"I thought 'go for it,'\" said Blashka, who underwent surgery in October 2015. \"They might find a cure for this someday and we might have helped.\" Mary's story After finding a lump, Blashka underwent testing - mammography, ultrasound and, eventually, biopsy. Her diagnosis was breast cancer. \"Dr. Owens was excellent from day one,\" Blashka said. \"He writes everything down for you and charts it out.\" Because the cancer was diagnosed at an early stage and did not have aggressive characteristics, she was eligible for IORT. Dr. Owens informed Blashka that she could have lumpectomy rather than mastectomy to surgically treat her breast cancer, but traditionally the lumpectomy would then be followed by weeks of radiation. It was welcome news when she learned that because of the clinical trial at Aurora BayCare, she qualified to have the radiation performed as a single treatment during surgery.\"They said my eyes lit up right away,\" Blashka said. \"(IORT) was less invasive and you wouldn't have to go back for radiation.\" With IORT, radiation delivery time is about 20 to 35 minutes during surgery.With the support of her husband, Richard, three children, five grandchildren and other family and friends, Blashka is cancer-free. \"They were behind me 100 percent,\" Blashka said. \"My husband was with me the entire time.\" Other than the expected recovery from undergoing surgery, Blashka suffered none of the side effects from traditional radiation therapy to the breast, such as redness, discomfort and fatigue. Trial details University of California-San Francisco is sponsoring the trial with a goal to enroll 755 subjects at about 25 sites in the United States. Patients selected for breast-conserving surgery who are considered to have a low risk of recurrence may be eligible. It is estimated that 25 percent of new breast cancer patients at Aurora BayCare will qualify. Sarah Peterson, RN, is serving as site coordinator for the clinical trial. Blashka's experience should not be used to predict outcomes of the clinical trial. Data collection continues.Patient spotlight \"I thought 'go for it.'

In August 2014, NCI designated Aurora Health Care as one of 34 institutions in the country an NCI Community Oncology Research Program site. With the designation comes $3.9 million over five years to bring NCI-sponsored clinical trials directly to the community. Led by principal investigators Thomas Saphner, MD, and Michael Thompson, MD, PhD, Aurora NCORP is on pace to reach 165 enrollments in year two of the grant, nearly Aurora Health Care was the top NCORP site in the Midwest to credit clinical trial enrollments to research group NRG Oncology for 2014-2015. Aurora NCORP ranked fourth nationwide for enrollments among NCORP sites affiliated with the group.doubling enrollment from the year before the grant was available. New membership to the Wake Forest, University of Rochester Cancer Center and Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology research bases played a key role in increasing patient enrollment. NCORP includes a range of cancer prevention, screening, control and treatment clinical trials. Currently, there are more than 50 NCI trials open to enrollment throughout Aurora. An example of a cancer control study, which focuses on enhancing quality of life and cancer care, is URCC's PSYCH (Evaluation of Psychoeducation for Cancer Patients Eligible for Clinical Trials, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02054715). Aurora researchers recruited subjects to determine how different educational interventions affect patient preparedness for clinical trial participation. Aurora NCORP also features precision medicine, studies like the ALCHEMIST trials (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT02194738, NCT02193282, NCT02201992). Using a subject's genetic information, researchers prescribe treatment targeted specifically to genetic abnormalities. Neha Glandt serves as the research program administrator in collaboration with oncology clinical trials manager Jan DeBartolo, MSN.Results show combination therapy extends life in advanced prostate cancer; follow-up continues Only a small percentage of prostate cancers spread, and for most patients with advanced prostate cancer there is no cure. Current treatments attempt to slow its spread, improving survival and quality of life. Results from a clinical trial showed that an investigational combination therapy extended life by more than a year for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2015, the results of the CHAARTED trial compared chemotherapy plus androgen ablation Rubina Qamar, MD, serves as principal investigator at Aurora Health Care. Produced in the testicles and adrenal glands, androgens can cause prostate cancer cells to grow. The current standard of care is androgen ablation therapy, a minimally invasive procedure that destroys abnormal cells. The purpose of this Phase III clinical trial was to determine if adding the chemotherapy drug docetaxel, which works in a different way to stop the growth of cancer cells, is more effective in improving survival. This National Cancer Institute trial is sponsored by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)-American College of Radiology Imaging Network An investigational combination therapy extended life by more than a year for men with metastatic prostate cancer.(ACRIN) Cancer Research Group. Nationwide, sites enrolled 790 subjects who will be followed for up to 10 years. 31 Aurora Research Institute | Annual Report 2015Wife's legacy continues to live on as center's focus transitions to cardio-oncology specialty Karen Yontz Women's Cardiac Awareness Center, located inside Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center, has offered education about heart disease to women for 20 years. Ken Yontz made the initial gift that helped start the center in 1996 in honor of his late wife Karen. Going forward, its focus will shift to the rapidly evolving cardio-oncology specialty. \"This new focus will really fit well into the cause of Karen's death,\" Ken said. \"She had Hodgkin's in her 20s and had a significant amount of chemotherapy and radiation. She died from a heart attack at the age of 48. Her heart disease was all related to her cancer treatment.\" That all too common result is precisely the kind of tragedy the cardio-oncology specialty was created to prevent. The new program, dubbed Karen Yontz Center for Cardio Oncology at Aurora Health Care, will be one of the first of its kind to feature a unique collaboration between cardiology and cancer service lines, advancing an initiative that has gained traction over the past few years. \"We're building a database that will monitor patients who are treated with potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy,\" said cardiologist Bijoy Khandheria, MD. \"This will allow us to track any cardiac side effects resulting from the cancer treatment and modify treatment plans as appropriate.\" James Weese, MD, vice president of Aurora Cancer Care, said the center will use molecular studies to find those Stud ying Cardio-Onco logy In A ugust 2015, Aurora Khandheria, MD, Rubina Qamar, MD, and Charles Bomzer, MD, along with several Italian collaborators, published a manuscript on the different imaging options used in cardio-oncology in Journal of Oncology.

JPCRR Vol. 1, Issue 3: Focus on cardio-oncologypatients at greatest risk for developing cardiac toxicity so that their physicians can individually tailor drug dosing and cardiac monitoring when using drugs with the potential to cause heart disease. \"This could change how cancer patients are cared for in the future,\" Dr. Weese said. \"Especially women, as many of the drugs being studied are often used to treat breast cancer.\" Dr. Khandheria said some patients, depending on their risk, will require heart screenings before, during and after their cancer treatment to see what kind of effect chemotherapy is having on the heart. Ken is excited about the impact the program is going to have. \"I'm just really encouraged,\" Ken said. \"The doctors who are involved are extremely impressive individuals and they are very engaged. There's a real need for this.\" \"Because of donors like Ken, we're going to advance the field and not just compete in it,\" Dr. Weese said. \"This is setting a new standard.\" A meta-analy sis led by senior research scientist Scarlet Shi, PhD, reviewed the incidence and risk factors of cardiotoxicity using the breast cancer chemotherapy drug trastuzumab. The findings were presented at Aurora Scientific Day 2015 and the abstract published in Journal of Patient-Centered Research and Reviews.Launching of Karen Yontz Center for Cardio Oncology at Aurora Health Care will advance Aurora-based research of new and better ways to diagnose and treat patients susceptible to the cardiotoxic effects of certain chemotherapy drugs.

Opened in May 2015, his reality - Aurora Neuroscience Innovation Institute (ANII) - includes a multidisciplinary clinic, education suite, neuroanatomical laboratory and four neurosurgical operating suites featuring first-in-the-world technology (see story on page 36) at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center. Publications/presentations In 2015, the ANII team shared its research findings through manuscript publication in peer-reviewed journals and abstract presentation at national and international meetings. Sharing their expert knowledge through textbook chapters, ANII team members literally wrote the book on endonasal endoscopic surgery of skull base tumors.With more than $1.4 million in equipment granted or donated by a variety of medical device companies, the neuroanatomical laboratory is equipped with surgical stations and imaging tools that replicate a neurosurgery suite to enable mock surgical procedures on cadaver specimens for training and research purposes. New imaging technology allows scientists to visualize intricate anatomy in the brain that has never been seen before and will lead to the discovery of safe approaches to access deep seated lesions in the brain without disrupting normal brain anatomy. After refining them in the neuroanatomical lab, Aurora researchers and clinicians will translate advanced neurosurgical techniques to the operating room, making procedures more accurate, less invasive and safer for patients.

Neurosurgeon Richard Rovin, MD, performs an awake craniotomy using Synaptive Medical Neurosurgical Solutions at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center.First in the world to use robotic optical microscope In a breakthrough with the potential to improve outcomes and reduce the risks of complex brain surgeries, the neurosurgical team at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center on April 20, 2015, successfully completed a first-in-the-world procedure with newly Food and Drug Administration-cleared technology for planning and resection. The operation utilized the entire suite of Synaptive Medical Neurosurgical Solutions: BrightMatter Guide, Plan, Vision and Servo. This system is comprised of four technologies: advanced optical visualization with efficient light delivery to the surgical field, automated positioning of the optical system at the command of the surgeon, visualization of interaction of surgical tools with medical images and three-dimensional tractography planning. As a result, the procedure was successfully performed with an awake anesthetic technique and minimal risk to the patient's brain function. Aurora Neuroscience Innovation Institute neuroradiologist Melanie Fukui, MD, and neurosurgeons Amin Kassam, MD, and Richard Rovin, MD, worked together to plan and perform the surgery.

Stem cell bank Access to human brain tumor samples is essential for a successful neuro-oncology research program to thrive since the stem cells derived from the samples will be used to test new cancer therapies in the lab. With an initial Aurora Cancer Care Research Award in 2014 and continued funding in 2015 totaling $50,000, Dr. Kassam established a brain tumor stem cell bank. The research award program is generously supported by Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. Using residual tissue from surgeries to remove brain tumors, researchers are collecting samples to grow and store stem cells. The project was initiated in an existing laboratory in the Regenerative Medicine Center at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center. The proximity of the lab to the operating rooms was advantageous to facilitate effective communication between the study team, operating room staff and pathology, and efficient transfer of the tumor tissue from the operating room to the lab. Coordination and streamlining of the process required the collaboration of neurosciences research nurse coordinators, representatives of the Biorepository and Specimen Resource Center, researcher scientists and technologists, and the surgeons. From 60 patients, researchers collected 76 samples of a variety of brain tumors. The research team developed a novel method to culture the tumor stem cells with an above-average success rate of 54%, with 68% for brain and spine tumors, or gliomas. Tissue collection is ongoing.Animal models After construction of Discovery Laboratory and the vivarium at Aurora Sinai Medical Center, the neuro-oncology researchers moved into the state-of-the-art facility, setting up shop and beginning the next phase of the research - characterization of the cells in animal models. Led by senior research scientist Chang-Hyuk Kwon, PhD, and neurosurgeon Richard Rovin, MD, the goal of the laboratory research is to determine whether the cells are able to reinitiate tumor growth in mice, since this stem cell characteristic of self-renewal contributes to tumor recurrence in humans. In 2016, researchers will use new methods of magnetic resonance imaging, ramen spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography to identify differences between healthy and unhealthy tissue at molecular and structural levels. MRI uses strong magnetic fields to create detailed images of tissues by detecting protons in water molecules. Research associate Deb Donohoe uses a microscope to analyze tumor stem cells in the Discovery Laboratory on the Aurora Sinai Medical Center campus.Researchers collected 76 samples of a variety of brain tumors. Using a novel culture method, the team had an above average success rate of 54%, with 68% for brain and spine tumors.aurora.org/research 38Award highlight Neurosurgeon believes cancer cure is possible \"We, like you and President (Barack) Obama, believe we can cure cancer.\" In an open letter, neurosurgeon Richard Rovin, MD, invited Vice President Joe Biden to check out the clinical and basic science research being conducted at Aurora Health Care, particularly in Aurora Research Institute's new Discovery Laboratory. Dr. Rovin, recipient of a $25,000 Aurora Cancer Care Research Award, is studying two methods to isolate and characterize cancer stem cells from metastatic brain tumors. The research award program is generously supported by Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. To study these cancer stem cells in the lab, they need to be separated from the rest of the cells in the tumor. There are several different methods to do this, but none have been used to grow cancer stem cells from metastatic brain tumors. The purpose of this research is to find a reliable and efficient way of growing cancer stem cells from Neurosurgeon Richard Rovin, MD, provides a tour of Discovery Laboratory during an interview on FOX 6 News. The reporter reached out to Dr. Rovin after he posted an open letter to Vice President Joe Biden.An infrastructure-building year, new staff joined Aurora Research Institute's neuro-oncology program: Chang-Hyuk Kwon, PhD, senior Monica Cucciare, research associate; and Amber LaCrosse, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow. Finding an efficient way to grow stem cells from brain tumors is the first step.OCT is a \"light\" ultrasound that measures tissue topography and structure. RS uses light to measure tissue chemistry, akin to chemical fingerprinting. Researchers are using these highly specialized imaging technologies before and after the tumor is removed from the patient, before the tumor stem cells are injected into mice and after the tumor has regrown in the mouse. The next phase of the program is to test new therapeutics on the tumor stem cells and in tumor-bearing mice, using the imaging modalities to detect tumor shrinkage or elimination. One method includes reengineering brain tumor stem cells and redeploying them using viral vectors, the most effective means of gene transfer. Three weeks after injecting brain tumor stem cells into the brain of a mouse avatar, a large tumor formed. The arrow points to an area of dead cells caused by the tumor, which were continuing to multiply. metastatic brain tumors by comparing the two different methods. Five patients with breast or non-small cell lung cancer who underwent brain surgery at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center have provided metastatic brain tumor tissue for the study. Enrollment continues with a goal of 25 subjects. A collaborative effort, the Biorepository and Specimen Resource Center is assisting with collection and storing of the tissues. This research is the first step toward the long-term goal of finding the molecular and genetic changes that take place in the stem cells of metastatic brain tumors. This knowledge will help explain how and why tumors spread to the brain. It will also help researchers find ways to prevent metastasis and to treat tumors once metastasis has happened.39 Aurora Research Institute | Annual Report 2015Making lemonade: Woman enrolls in trial to fight cancer When faced with a lemon-sized tumor in the right side of her brain, Heidi Zellmer of Cedarburg began a journey that would lead the wife and mother of three boys to enroll in a clinical trial testing an investigational combination of chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme, a fast-growing brain cancer. One fall day a few months before her 50th birthday, Zellmer completed a five-mile hike along the bluffs of Devil's Lake in south central Wisconsin. About a week later, she went to the emergency department at Aurora Medical Center in Grafton with stroke-like symptoms. It wasn't a stroke though. A CAT scan revealed the tumor. One-two punch After being transported via ambulance to Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center, Zellmer spent about a week in the neurointensive care unit undergoing tests before Amin Kassam, MD, performed the awake craniotomy to remove the tumor. George Bobustuc, MD, took over her cancer care that included six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation at Aurora Grafton. Near the end of her treatment cycle, Dr. Bobustuc informed Zellmer about a clinical trial testing whether temozolomide chemotherapy is more effective with veliparib at improving overall survival in subjects with a particular genetic indications (National Cancer Institute, clinicaltrials. gov identifier: NCT02152982). Acting as a one-two punch, the chemotherapy damages the cancer cell and the veliparib, a PARP inhibitor, prevents the body from producing a protein that would repair the cell, thereby making it easier to kill. As part of the research protocol, subjects are randomized to receive the chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor or the chemotherapy and placebo. Zellmer agreed to enroll in the trial, even though she couldn't be sure she would receive the PARP inhibitor. \"If it could extend my life, why not?\" Zellmer said. Surrounded by beauty The family's vacation to Hawaii, originally planned for Christmas, transformed into Zellmer's 50th birthday celebration in February. Though she didn't want to feel ill from the therapy during the trip, she didn't want it looming over her head either. She started the first round of the study treatment, an oral therapy, in Hawaii. \"It was still worth it,\" Zellmer said. \"Being in Hawaii, being outside surrounded by beauty, was very good for my well-being.\" Feeling ill the first two days, she checked in with research study coordinator Lynda Yanny, BSN, who told her how to \"stay ahead\" of the symptoms. Support and care A spiritual person, Zellmer has relied on her Christian faith, positivity and extensive support system to carry her through. Not only has her immediate family - husband John and sons Zachary, 22, Benjamin, 10, and Aaron, 8 - stepped up, her mother and sister in Washington, her brother in Alaska as well as friends and neighbors - \"people we didn't even know\" - have pitched in.Chemotherapy damages the cancer cell and the veliparib prevents the body from producing a protein that would repair the cell.NH3C NN H OH H2N A depiction of how veliparib works in the fight against cancer.

The drug dimethyl fumarate cuts down on the number of relapses. James Napier, MD, is leading an observational clinical trial at Aurora BayCare Medical Center to track serious adverse events that lead to the discontinuation of dimethyl fumarate in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (ESTEEM, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02047097). Sponsored by the drug's manufacturer Biogen Inc., the global study will follow about 5,000 subjects for five years. Researchers will track different serious adverse events, including infections, hepatic events, malignancies and renal events. Jennifer Homa, MS, is serving as site coordinator.The drug dimethyl fumarate cuts down on Neuro Researc h CommitteesAnd she couldn't say enough about her care team throughout Aurora Health Care. \"I feel like I'm getting the best care I can get,\" she said. Looking forward Zellmer takes one day at a time. She's looking forward to seeing Zachary graduate college in Seattle this June. Study treatments wrap up then, though she will be followed for 10 years. \"I think medicine has changed a lot,\" Zellmer said. \"I'm thankful it is the decade we live in now and hope there are more studies to cure this.\" Walking a mile a day, Zellmer hopes to hike the bluffs of Devil's Lake again this fall. She goes for an MRI every eight weeks to see if the tumor has grown back. Her scan in March was clear of tumors. Zellmer is participating in a trial being conducted by Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology. Alliance is a member of the National Cancer Institute National Clinical Trials Network and serves as a research base for the NCI Community Research Oncology Program. Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center is member of the Alliance NCTN network. Zellmer's experience should not be used to predict outcomes of the clinical trial. Data collection continues. George treatment Developing new strategies to treat the most frequent forms of brain cancer is the driving force behind the research of senior research scientist Santhi Konduri, PhD, and neuro-oncologist George Bobustuc, MD. Patient-derived cancer cells are tested to identify different markers associated with glioblastoma multiforme and meningioma brain cancers. The long-term goal is to understand molecular changes that occur during tumor development and to use these molecular markers as therapeutic targets, individualizing treatment to the patient's specific genetic make-up. The ultimate goal is to design a safe, effective system allowing for use of a combination of drugs and therapies unique to each patient.

Study helps patients get treatment for bowel, bladder dysfunction, then measures quality-of-life improvementsThere are numerous prediction tests to determine a child's gender before the baby is born. Is the mother carrying low? Expect a boy. Fetal heart rate more than 140 bpm? Expect a girl. A Chinese model uses the month and mother's age at conception. The accuracy of these methods is dubious at best. Bowel and bladder dysfunction are difficult topics to discuss, even with a health care provider. To avoid the embarrassment, many people adjust their habits and lifestyles to accommodate the management of symptoms. A survey study measuring subject satisfaction is offering a discrete way for underserved people suffering with these conditions to get the medical care they need. Patients arriving at an Aurora Family Practice, Internal Medicine or Women's Health clinic will have an opportunity to fill out a questionnaire on their bowel and bladder function and indicate whether they are interested in setting up a consultation with Sonographer Michael McFadzen shares his findings on maternal intuition with attendees of the poster session at Aurora Scientific Day. McFadzen completed data collection in 2015 and hopes to publish his findings in 2016.Obstetrics sonographer Michael McFadzen, BS, ARDMS, questioned whether maternal intuition might be a more accurate predictor. Based at Aurora Sheboygan Clinic, McFadzen tested his hypothesis, presenting the preliminary findings at Aurora Scientific Day. All patients between 17 and 23 weeks pregnant were asked if they had an intuition about the baby's gender during their second trimester screening ultrasound. Patients with advance knowledge of fetal gender from imaging results were excluded from the study. Ultrasound was used to confirm or debunk the mother's intuition. Data collection wrapped up in 2015 and manuscript preparation is in progress. David Dielentheis, MD, and Ronda Kasten contributed to the study.

George DeVries, DPM, and Brandon Scharer, DPM, presented their findings at the 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons Conference. Led by Dr. DeVries, the researchers studied outcomes of a grafting process that utilized a manufactured bone morphogenetic protein rather than a bone fragment harvested from elsewhere in the body to fuse bones in the foot and ankle, a treatment to relieve pain. With promising initial findings and inherent advantages, the researchers recommend further study. Led by Dr. Scharer, the researchers compared two surgical approaches for treating bunions. Chevron osteotomy is the standard treatment, which corrects the alignment of the bone. With the distal oblique approach, which has not been applied to bunions, the surgeon approaches the surgery at an angle. Both outcomes and patient satisfaction between the two techniques were similar. Taylor Romdenne coordinated the studies. Randall Lambrecht, PhD, J.

Dennis Baumgardner, MD, directs these activities. Led by Marie Forgie, DO, a randomized clinical trial comparing Foley catheter insertion techniques - stylette versus no stylette - for the induction of labor was selected as one of the Aurora Scientific Day Rieselbach distinguished papers and won the Central Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology 2015 Community Hospital Award. Published in early 2016 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the manuscript concludes that the use of a stylette to guide catheter insertion does not improve speed of insertion, reduce patient pain levels or decrease failure of catheter placement when compared to insertion without a stylette. Neither technique - stylette versus no stylette - was deemed superior. Jessica Kram, MPH, Danielle Greer, PhD, Kiley Vander Wyst, MPH, Nikki Salvo, MD, and Danish Siddiqui, MD, contributed to the study and manuscript.Studying whether tumor diameter is an important predictor in determining whether low-risk women can avoid surgery to remove their lymph nodes after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer, the team led by Callie Cox Bauer, DO (pictured at right), won the Dr. George W. Morley Memorial Paper Award at the Central Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology annual meeting. The study, later published in the Journal of Gynecologic Oncology, found that tumor diameter is an important predictor for identifying whether the cancer has spread. Ultimately, use of the study's proposed risk model, which incorporated tumor diameter and myometrial invasion, may reduce the number of surgeries for lymph node removal in low-risk women. Danielle Greer, PhD, Jessica Kram, MPH, and Scott Kamelle, MD, contributed to the study and manuscript. Winning the 2015 Aurora Quality Improvement Award and presenting findings at the Wisconsin Research and Education Network Convocation of Practices, a team of Aurora UW Medical Group researchers assessed how well a unified workflow improved medication reconciliation for Aurora St. Luke's Family Practice patients. The team found that implementation of a systematic workflow and education for the care team led to overall improvement in accuracy of electronic health record medication reconciliation. This quality improvement project led to identification of multiple barriers to accuracy, which could then be addressed. Loras Even, DO, Jessica Konarske, DO, Katherine Meyers, DO, Christopher Klink, PharmD, Jessica Kram, MPH, and Dennis Baumgardner, MD, contributed to the study. Dr. Meyers won third place for her oral presentation at Aurora Scientific Day.Presenting at the Wisconsin Research and Education Network Convocation of Practices, Fabiana Kotovicz, MD, and medical resident Courtney Pokrzywa shared findings on the use of opioids for chronic pain management. The findings fuel the fire of the controversy over this national epidemic. Opioid prescription for chronic pain management was inconsistent and did not adhere to recommended guidelines at the two clinics studied, though further research is required. To address the problem, Dr. Kotovicz and a team of researchers developed an educational intervention to empower family medicine residents on safe opioid prescribing. The findings were presented at the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine annual spring conference in 2016. Michael McNett, MD, Kayla Flores, MD, Stephanie McDearmon, MD, Brandon Phelps, DO, Brian Wallace, MD, Jessica Kram, MPH, and Dennis Baumgardner, MD, contributed to the study.The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration awarded more than $396,000 over three years to Aurora Senior Services for its Geriatrics Scholars Program. Project director Michael Malone, MD, with assistance from co-project director Aaron Malsch, MSN, will lead the program, which will develop three teams to improve care and transitions for older adults. The Sponsored Programs Office was instrumental in securing the grant. Ariba Khan, MD, was named to a research award for her project presented at the 2015 Delirium Boot Camp at Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The award was sponsored by the Center of Excellence for Delirium in Aging: Research, Training and Educational Enhancement. Dr. Khan will build on the studies she led to develop an automated model using electronic health record data to identify delirium in hospitalized older adults and older adults at risk for 30-day hospital readmission and 30-day mortality. She presented the studies at the American Geriatrics Society 2015 annual scientific meeting.

A collaboration of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and Aurora Health Care, the center is an independent entity focused on identifying the determinants of health and disease, designing and implementing preventive interventions that promote the health and well-being of populations, and measuring their effectiveness. Linking patients to appropriate care Through the Milwaukee Health Care Partnership's Emergency Department Care Coordination initiative, avoidable emergency department usage has decreased with high-risk patients connected to primary care services. Patients presenting with one of five priority conditions at any of the 10 participating Milwaukee County hospital emergency departments are partnered with a social worker, who schedules an appointment for the patient with his or her new medical home - a local community clinic. Center researchers are evaluating appointment data to measure the initiative's success. \"Aurora Family Service, in partnership with Aurora Sinai Medical Center, launched an intensive case management pilot program for patients identified as high utilizers of emergency department services,\" said Robert Marrs, MS, manager of Integrated Family Support Services, Aurora Health Care. \"These are patients with significant comorbidity and 11-plus visits over a 12-month period. Results of the initial pilot of 47 patients demonstrated a 57 percent decrease in hospital charges and a 50 percent decrease in ED visits after six months of enrollment.\" Though 72 percent of Wisconsin adults were considered up to date on their colorectal cancer screening in 2012, the rate was only 34 percent for federally qualified health centers and community clinics, which serve a high population of black, Hispanic and Hmong adults living below the poverty line in the Milwaukee area. With funding from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers are partnering with all Milwaukee federally qualified health centers and Aurora's Walkers Point Clinic to increase colorectal cancer screening rates closer to the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable's goal of 80 percent by 2018. Findings from the Milwaukee Health Care Partnership's 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment of Milwaukee County revealed that access to affordable health care services continues to rank as a pressing need, but chronic disease management and prevention rose as a high priority. Other top issues included violence, lack of access to oral health and behavioral health care services, and difficulty in navigating complex systems of care. \"This assessment builds on more than a decade of community health survey data that has been instrumental to hospitals and local health departments in the region,\" said Mark Huber, MS, senior vice president of social responsibility, Aurora Health Care, and the partnership's assessment committee chair. \"The assessment data helps us target health disparities and State and local contracts 54%State and local foundations 29% Federal 17%Extramural funding sources in 2015 22 grants and contracts awarded$1.4 million= Increasing colorectal cancer screening Assessing the health of communities Access to affordable health care and chronic disease management are high priorities.important health indicators. With that information, we can establish concrete goals for health education, interventions and investments.\" Each hospital and local health department in Milwaukee will select priorities and develop individualized plans to improve the health of the community it serves. Center researchers analyze key informant interviews and focus group feedback, compile secondary data reports and create a summary of all the reports for the assessment every three years.aurora.org/research 48Study examines impact of bundled program for care of older adults Gastrointestinal focusThe Helen Daniels Bader Fund, a Bader Philanthropy, is dedicated to supporting efforts that improve the health of older adults. HDBF awarded a $125,000 grant to Aurora Health Care. Principal investigators Michelle Simpson, PhD, RN, and Michael Malone, MD, will study ways to prevent delirium and functional decline among older adults receiving care in a rural setting. The research project will implement the evidence-based Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) at two rural Aurora medical centers and continue the program in the home care setting. HELP utilizes an innovative model of care to maintain physical and cognitive functioning throughout hospitalization, assist with the transition from hospital to home and prevent unplanned readmission for older adults. Using a previous grant from the HDBF, Dr. Simpson led a study to The gastrointestinal department at Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center continues to conduct clinical research. Under the mentorship of gastroenterologist Nalini Guda, MD, the GI research team presented findings for multiple studies at the 2015 Digestive Diseases Week, an international annual conference organized by American Gastroenterology Association, American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society for Surgery of Alimentary Tract. The Proficient Study, published in a Gastrointestinal Endoscopy develop an evidence-based hospital readmission risk score for older adults receiving home care. Combining HELP with the risk score model and continuing HELP in the home care setting, clinicians will intervene on vulnerable older adults who are discharged to their home with the bundled program. Researchers will examine the impact of the bundled program in the two rural hospitals and the corresponding home care market on clinical outcomes and patient experience. 2015 EXTRAMURAL AWARD RECIPIENTS John Brill, MD University of Wisconsin/State of Wisconsin $140,165 Aurora Lakeland rural training track Michelle Simpson, PhD, RN Bader Philanthropies Inc. $125,000 Prevention and early identification of rural older adults' clinical deterioration: The bundled HELP at Home intervention Michael Farrell, MD Aurora UW Medical Group $44,000 Rapid-throughout assessment and feedback of caregivers' communication quality at the point of care Michelle Simpson, PhD, RN Bader Philanthropies Inc. $40,000 Improving home health care for the elderly: Predicting clinical deterioration among older adults with and without dementia in the home care setting Jessica Chapin, PhD American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology Foundation $12,000 Impact of neuropsychological evaluations for dementia on health care utilization and quality indicators: a multicenter study Ron Cisler, PhD Center for Urban Population Health/Medical College of Wisconsin $1,000 Understanding, developing and measuring outcomes that matter for healthy weight in African-American women The Proficient Study established criteria for minimum training time and procedure volume.Nursing research supplement, analyzed data on the competency of advanced endoscopy trainees, establishing minimum training time and procedure volume required to successfully perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
