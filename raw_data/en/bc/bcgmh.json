Examples of petty cash uses include reimbursement to employees for out -of-pocket purchases of office supplies and postage. 1020 \u00b7 Cash in Daily Drawer The cash dr awer represents the amount of cash on hand to provide change to clients, who are making cash purchases of services and retail items, or are settling t he balances of their accounts. A separate petty cash fund should be maintained for incidental expenses. See account 1010 - Petty Cash 1030 \u00b7 Undeposited Funds This account records client payments and other receipts on premises or otherwise under practice control, and not yet deposited to the bank. 1050 \u00b7 Primary Checking Account The chief operating bank acc ount used for daily fee collection deposits and for paying bills. 1060 \u00b7 Secondary Checking Account Many practices maintain more than one checking account, such as an account for payroll or an account that reflects the activity of a second practice locat ion. Assign each checking account its own chronologic number in the AAHA/VMG COA -CA. 1150 \u00b7 Savings Account In general, a practice savings account serves as an interest -bearing repository of reserve funds for working -capital requirements or for planned investments or commitments such as employee retirement funding. 1200 \u00b7 Certificates of Deposit Record investments in certificate of deposits to this account. Interest earned on investments will be recorded in the 9050 account for interest revenues either at the time the interest is received (cash basis accounting) or when the right to it is earned ( accrual basis accounting). 1250 \u00b7 Money Market Account Either a commercial bank's account or a brokerage- held account, a practice money market account provides another interest -bearing option for reserving funds to meet working capital needs or for future practice commitments. 1300 \u00b7 Accounts Receivable The account used for recording client -owed am ounts for veterinary services and ancillary purchases. 1301 \u00b7 Accounts Receivable - Wellness/Pre- Paid Plans This is an account used for recording billed client -owed amounts for wellness/pre -paid plans. AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 10 1305 \u00b7 Allowance for Uncollectable Accounts This is a contra asset account associated with accounts receivable. This account will maintain a credit balance and should be used when anticipating a portion of the accounts receivable will be uncollectible in the future. 1350 \u00b7 Drugs and Medi cal Supply Inventory Inventory value should be a reasonable approximation of drugs on hand (at acquisition cost) at quarterly reporting dates, including partial packages. 1400 \u00b7 Employee Advances Advances to employees, most often as very short -term loans against future wages are recorded in this account . 1450 \u00b7 Advances - Related Party This account is used to record episodic and quickly repaid personal expenditures made on behalf of officers or owners of the practice. 1500 \u00b7 Note Receivable - Related Party Notes receivable usually reflect an interest -bearing loan of a large money amount or sale of valuable company property to an individual, with the requirement for repayment of the amount or value. If the terms of the loan provide for repayment to the practice over a period of longer than one year, then the portion to be repaid in greater than twelve months' time is recorded in account 2600, Long Term Portion of Notes Receivable. Account 1500 is explicitly reserved for amounts loaned to individuals who are related to the practice through ownership rights or through fiduciary responsibility, such as a director or officer. 1590 \u00b7 Note Receivable - Other This account carries amounts owed to the practice, usually by non- owner employees or related entities . Occasionally, it will also include client -signed promissory notes made to the practice when the client has renegotiated large, outstanding accounts -receivable amounts for documented re- payment over time. 1600 \u00b7 Prepaid Expenses Recor d in this account a ny payments that reflect the acquisition of services that the practice will use in a future financial period. In the financial period of their use, adjust prepaid amounts as expenses and reduces the asset value of the prepaid expense acc ount. Some examples of prepaid expenses are airline tickets and convention registration purchased for a continuing education event scheduled some months in the future; professional dues and membership payments for a future membership period; and service contracts that cover one or several years of future financial periods. Include in this account prepaid insurance premiums, prepaid r ent, prepaid federal income tax, prepaid state income and/or franchise tax, and prepaid local income t ax if applicable to your practice. 1800 \u00b7 Deposits for New Equipment Record in this account any down payments made for equipment orders and similar assets that will be received and put in service at a future date. AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 11 1850 \u00b7 Construction in Progress When the practice is renovating o r expanding facility or constructing other capital assets that have not yet been put into service, payments made for the ongoing construction project are coded here. Once the project is complete, and all costs have been accumulated, the total is re- classed to the appropriate fixed asset accounts with adequately detailed descriptions. When the building or constructed asset is put in service, depreciation can begin. Fixed Asset Account Series 2000 \u00b7 Professional Medical Equipment The acquisition costs of all medical, surgical, and diagnostic equipment used for service provision and revenue generation are included in this account. Examples include autoclaves and sterilization equipment; surgery and anesthetic equipment; X -ray machines and other imaging equipment such as ultrasound machines; microscopes and bench laboratory machines; and any other type of medical, patient -support, or monitoring equipment. Any item of equipment to which the practice has title or realistically will have title through acquisition contract terms should be listed in this account. 2050 \u00b7 Computer Hardware Record all purchased computer equipment in this account, including electronic office equipment such as electronic cash registers, computer peripheral equipment, modems, surge protectors, computer cabling, servers, video monitors, printers, fax machines and network copiers. As the practice takes computer equipment out of service (often due to obsolescence as much as to breakage), it should also dis pose of and remove the equipment from the accounting records. 2100 \u00b7 Office Equipment, Furniture & Fixtures This fixed asset account includes all non- computer office equipment acquisitions, such as phone systems, calculators, photocopiers (not computer -networked), typewriters, paper -shredders, and similar equipment. It also includes appliances such as washers, dryers, freezers, and TVs not associated with medical equipment. The account also includes office furnishings such as desks, filing cabinets, chairs , waiting room furniture, decor, lockers, bookcases, movable lighting fixtures, signs, and other appurtenances not permanently affixed and integral features of the building. 2150 \u00b7 Practice Vehicles and Related Equipment Vehicles owned by and titled to the practice are coded in this account, and in general are used in the production of veterinary revenue (patient transport, house calls, business errands and travel). Debatable issues affecting appropriate accounting for leased vehicles dictate you seek the practice accountant's input and advice so that regulatory compliance occurs. Additionally, vehicles used in companion animal practice may have mixed use for personal use and commuting, as well as for the purposes of conducting veterinary business. Once bus iness use (which does NOT include commuting) falls below 50%, special rules apply to depreciation. 2200 \u00b7 Leasehold/Building Improvements Code building construction projects that upgrade and/or extend the useful life of practice -occupied buildings in this account. Integral, stationary, and permanently affixed parts of the facility, building AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 12 improvements increase its value and usefulness. Improvements include renovations, additions, permanent upgrades, new roofs, and new floors. Capitalize major repairs, which add significant facility value or life expectancy, for inclusion in this account. 2300 \u00b7 Buildings Record any costs of buildings to which the practice holds ownership title in this account. 2350 \u00b7 Land Improvements Improvements made to land owned or leased by the practice, which includes such enhancements as driveways, sidewalks, landscaping, storm drainage, utilities, and septic system s. 2400 \u00b7 Land Record in this account the cost of any land purchased by the practice, to which it takes title (an estate in real property). As a non -wasting asset, land is not depreciated. As such, no accumulated depreciation account exists for this fixed asset. 2450 \u00b7 Accumulated Depreciation This is a general \"catch- all\" account for use in recording accumulated depreciation for all depreciable assets, in the event the practice owners (or accountant) prefers not to group accumulated depreciation with its related asset classes (professional equipment, office equipment, etc.) This provides an expedited method for tracking accumulated depreciation in a single balance sheet account. Asset Account Series 2500 \u00b7 Computer Software Computer software purchases are capitalized and recorded in this account. Often, computer software is bundled as part of a computer system purchase. The portion of the purchase price attributable to software is identified and recorded in this account. Since tax rules change about the correct way to depreciate or amortize software, speak with the practice's accountant to decide the best way to record system purchases which include both hardware and software components. 2520 \u00b7 Goodwill Goodwill recorded in the practice books depends on the fact of a transaction involving goodwill acquisition at some time in the entity's history. Goodwill represents the amount paid for an existing practice entity (target) that is in excess of the target's other assets at the time of purchase. This account is only used for recording the purchase of preexisting goodwill from another entity. 2560 \u00b7 Covenant Not to Compete The negotiated price assigned to the covenant not to compete in the course of allocating the total practice purchase is recorded in this account. 2580 \u00b7 Organizational & Startup Costs Costs related to veterinary practice start up and organization are capitalized and recorded to this account, including legal, accounting, site selection, appraisals, and any other fees incurred prior to the actual opening of the doors for business. AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 13 2585 \u00b7 Loan Costs Loan costs should be amortized over the life of the loan. Fees such as legal, accounting, registration and bank fees incurred in conjunction with obtaining or refinancing a loan are considered loan fees. Record all such loan fees in this account and amort ize them by debiting amortization expense account 8050 and crediting 2599 Accumulated Amortization monthly over the life of the loan. 2599 \u00b7 Accumulated Amortization This is a general \"catch -all\" account for use in recording accumulated amortization for all intangible and amortizable assets. This provides an expedited method for tracking accumulated amortization in a single balance sheet account. 2600 \u00b7 Note Receivable - Long Term Portion (less Current Portion) This account reflects the principle portion of promissory notes and secured notes for which receipt occurs at greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date. Adjust the note's current portion, that is, the principal amount receivable in 12 months or less, in accounts 1450 or 1500. 2700 \u00b7 Refundable Deposits (Rent, Utilities, Etc.) Use this account to record the amount of refundable deposits made at the initiation of a service, such as utilities. If the deposit is non- refundable, then it should be expensed when the expenditure occurred. 2850 \u00b7 Other Assets Include in this account the cash value of any practice- owned life insurance policy or other assets not specified in listed asset accounts. Current Liabilities Account Series 3000 \u00b7 Accounts Payable Code amounts owed to vendors for purchases made on credit. Such purchases are made to acquire the supplies, services, and materials needed for the practice of veterinary medicine. This account is a control account for a subsidiary ledger of each vendor, the amounts owed to that vendor, and aged amount of the payable (showing whether the payable amounts are current, or represent credit purchases that occurred 30, 60, 90, or more days in the past). 3010 \u00b7 Credit Cards Payable This account represents all purchases made through the use of a c redit card. 3020 \u00b7 Line of Credit The balance in this account represents total amount outstanding on the line of credit at any one time. 3030 \u00b7 Current Portion of Long Term Loans & Capital Leases Payable Practice debt contracted for payment over a period greater than one year is posted to two accounts. Record the loan principal portion due in less than twelve months to this account. Account for the principal portions of loans due in greater than twelve months in the 3800 series. Adjustments to long- and short - term portions are typically made at the end of the accounting period. AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 14 3050 \u00b7 Loan Payable - Related Party An officer or owner may loan money to the practice from time to time. This account represents the amount owed to the related party that wil l be repaid within one year. If the loan will extend beyond twelve months, then the loan should be accounted for as to the long- term and short -term portions. 3055 \u00b7 Unearned Revenue This account represents a liability account to record payments received i n advance of providing goods or services. As goods and services are provided, the bookkeeper should debit this account and credit the appropriate revenue category. 3060 \u00b7 Deferred Liability - Wellness/Pre -Paid Plans This account is used to record wellness /pre-paid plan enrollments for the full contract amount and represents future obligation to the client. As services are consumed from the wellness /pre-paid, the amount is reclassed from this account to revenue. All unused services for wellness /pre-paid plans are recognized as revenue in account 5880 - Wellness /Pre-Paid Plans Revenue for the last month of the service period. Employer , Payroll, & Benefit Liabilities Account Series 3110 \u00b7 Payroll Tax Payable Include in this account employer FICA tax which consists of Medicare and OASDI (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance). The employer's FICA obligation is recorded here, as the amount that must be remitted to the IRS coincident with the remittance of FICA payroll tax withholding from employee wages for a recently paid payroll. Include in this account federal unemployment tax payable which includes the balance of federal unemployment tax accrued on previously paid wages but not yet paid to the IRS. Include in this account state unemploym ent tax payable which reflects state unemployment tax accrued on previously paid wages but not yet paid to the state agency. 3140 \u00b7 Workers Compensation Payable This account reflects workers compensation premiums payable but not yet remitted to the insurer. Workers compensation premium cost is considered a tax (rather than insurance) by many accountants, as it is not a voluntary payment but a legally mandated one when an employer has employees. 3150 \u00b7 Accrued Payroll and Bonuses The value of employee wor k time that has occurred, but the practice will not pay until the next payroll date is said to be accrued. The practice incurs a liability to pay the employee for his or her time, but the pay period has not yet completely run, so is not due for payment. Fo r accrual -based practices, this account generally carries a balance at the fiscal year end, when workers have wages due to them for hours worked, that the practice will not pay until the pay date falling in the first or second week of the following year. The value of any holiday, personal, or sick time earned by employees and not yet paid is carried in this account. Cash basis practices will generally not use this account. AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 15 3160 \u00b7 Accrued Payroll Taxes This account carries the outstanding balance of employer payroll tax obligations associated with accrued wages and accrued paid time off (account 3150). It generally includes only the employer's portion of FICA tax, federal unemployment tax, and state unemployment tax associated with accrued wages and salary obligations. Like accrued payroll, generally only accrual based accounting method companies use this account. 3170 \u00b7 Employer Retirement Plan Contribution Payable This account carries the balance of previously committed, but not yet paid, contributions to the employer - sponsored retirement plan in accord with the plan document's requirements. Many plans allow the employer to take a deduction for the committed amount in the year to which it pertains, whether paid or not, and regardless of whether the practice is cash or accrual based for tax purposes. The practice generally has until the extended due date of the federal tax return to pay the funding obligation. Employee, Payroll, & Benefit Liabilities Account Series 3200 \u00b7 Payroll Tax Withholding Payable This account carries the balance of federal income tax withheld from employee wages that has not yet been paid to the IRS. The federal income taxes withheld and remitted by the employer on the employee's behalf do not belong to the empl oyer. The employer functions as an agent of the government to assure the timely remittance of employee tax payments through forced withholding by the employer. This account records the balance of Social Security tax withheld from employee wages and salary payments, which the practice has not yet remitted to the IRS. As of the practice's year -end date, any outstanding amounts withheld from wages and not yet paid are presented, both for accrual and cash based practices. Social Security is a trust fund tax. This account records the balance of Medicare tax withheld from employee wages and salary payments, which the practice has not yet remitted to the IRS. As of the practice's year -end date, any outstanding amounts withheld from wages and not yet paid are pres ented, both for accrual and cash based practices. As with Social Security, Medicare is a trust fund tax. Similar to federal income tax withholding regulations, each state which taxes its residents on income requires the employer to enforce employee tax payment by functioning as an agent to hold back the required portion of wages as tax and submit the amount to the state in accord with its filing requirements. Like federal and state income tax withholding, some cities and/or regions also tax resident and/o r worker income. City or regional income tax may be based on where the employee works and/or where the employee lives. The employer must withhold the prescribed amount from the employee's wages and submit the tax amounts in accord with mandated filing deadlines. The employer has no rights to the amounts withheld from employee wages, for payment as local taxes. The employer is an agent for the government, to assure timely worker tax payment on earned income. 3260 \u00b7 Employee Withholding Payable From time to time, some employees will experience court -ordered wage withholdings that are designated AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 16 for use by some agency. In accord with the court order, the practice withholds the required amount and forwards it to the requisite agency on the employee's behalf. The balance carried in this account represents all withholdings not yet remitted to the agencies. Both accrual and cash based practice entities use this account to record the obligation for submission of employee withholdings for health insurance premiums. The balance of funds withheld from employee wages which the employer has not yet remitted for payment of the practice's group health insurance premiums is recorded in this account. Both accrual and cash based practice entities use this account to record the obligation for submission of employee- designated retirement funding. The employee advises the employer at prescribed times about the wage amount (deferred taxable compensation) the employee wishes the employer to withhold and deposit to his or her des ignated retirement funds. The balance of funds withheld from employee wages which the employer has not yet deposited with the retirement fund trustee is recorded in this account. Amounts that the employer commits to retirement funding on behalf of employees are recorded to account 3170. Code any other employer -withheld amounts from employee wages, not previously described, to this account. When the practice submits the withheld amounts to the designated payee, the account balance returns to zero. Other Tax Liabilities Account Series 3400 \u00b7 Sales and Use Tax Payable Many states require businesses to collect sales tax from consumers when they make purchases. When the practice collects sales tax from its clients at point of sale, the tax amount is credited to this account until the time the practice remits all collected tax amounts to the state. The requirements are comparable to payroll tax withholding rules: the state requires the practice to function as its agent, by collecting the appropriate amount of tax on subject sales and remitting it to the state revenue depart ment. 3420 \u00b7 Accrued Property Tax Payable If the practice owns real estate or is obligated through the lease agreement to pay taxes on the real estate, post the amount due and not yet paid to this account. Some states tax the value of personal property, either tangible property or intangible property or both. Accrual -based practices use this account to record the amount due and not yet paid. 3500 \u00b7 Corporate Income Tax Payable Both cash -basis and accrual -basis corporations use this account to r ecord the amount of federal income tax owed for the most recently completed tax year. In general, the account only pertains to Subchapter C Corporations and Personal Service Corporations. All other legal entity types allow taxable practice income to pass t hrough to individual owners for reporting on their personal tax returns. This account records any practice- owed income tax at the state, city, local or regional level that has not yet been paid. AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 17 Long Term Liabilities Account Series 3800 \u00b7 Long Term Porti on of Loans and Capital Lease Payable Record the principal portion of loans scheduled for repayment over a period greater than one year. Such loans will have terms that include a stated principal amount, monthly payment amount, and a stated interest rate. The current portion of the debt, the principal portion that will be repaid within a calendar or fiscal year, will be reported in account 3030. Most common long- term debt examples include mortgages and equipment loans with repayment schedules spanning mult iple years. Also known as a purchase lease, a capital lease provides for transferred title of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, usually for some bargain price such as one dollar. This account maintains the principal balance that is due in greater than twelve months from the balance sheet report date. The current portion of a capital lease is reported in account 3030. Owner Equity or Capital Account s Series 4000 \u00b7 Common Stock This account title pertains to practices functioning in any of the corporate formats. The account balance reflects the value of issued and outstanding shares of corporate stock, usually at their original stated value. This is an account that infrequently changes, so it is likely any adjustments w ill come from the practice's accountant as a result of significant transaction events related to practice ownership. Often, the only transaction shown in the account occurs at the inception of the corporation when it issues shares to the first shareholders . Other tax entity types, such as partnerships, sole proprietorships, and limited liability companies that have not elected treatment as corporations, will change the title of this account to reflect the entity type: Proprietorship: 4000 \u00b7 Owner's Capital Partnership: 4000 \u00b7 Partner's Capital - Partner One 4010 \u00b7 Partner's Capital - Partner Two 4020 \u00b7 Partner's Capital - Partner Three, etc. Limited Liability Company: 4000 \u00b7 Member's Capital - Member One 4010 \u00b7 Member's Capital - Member Two 4020 \u00b7 Member's Capital - Member Three, etc. 4100 \u00b7 Additional Paid In Capital Record any capital paid by shareholders to the corporation in excess of the stated share value. Generally, this account is used very infrequently, often only at t he corporation's inception when it issues stock to the new shareholders in exchange for money and property. Any value in excess of the stated share value, which can be found in the original articles of incorporation, is recorded as additional paid in capit al (commonly abbreviated APIC). AAHA/VMG C ompanion Animal Field Definitions 18 4200 \u00b7 Retained Earnings (Retained Deficit) This account reflects a practice's accumulated profits and losses over time, which have not been distributed to owners. The account is presented separately from the Common Stock and Additional Paid in Capital accounts because it derives its balances from operational results, not from financing. 4300 \u00b7 Distributions/Dividends/Draws Any dividends (Subchapter C or a personal service corporation (PSC)) or distributions (Subchapter S Corporation) are recorded here during the fiscal year. At the beginning of the subsequent fiscal year, all dividends and distributions are closed by an account adjustment to Retained Earnings/(Deficit), account 4200. Withdrawals by members of an unincorporated entity will be booked to this account, also . Modify the account title to reflect the entity type: Owner Draws, Partner Draws, or Member Draws. 4400 \u00b7 Common Stock/Treasury Treasury stock is the amount of previously issued stock subsequently redeemed and held by the corporation. This situation usually occurs when a shareholder retires from the practice and sells his shares back to the corporation rather than to another individual. When the corporation purchases i ts own shares from the departing shareholder, the shares are said to be in the treasury.

In the veterinary profession, the level of fee discounting can be relatively significant. For this reason, discounts are recorded as a debit directly offsetti ng operational revenues, so that management has an improved awareness of discounting impact on overall cost of operations. When offset against gross revenues charged, discounts reduce the total operating revenue figure that is used to calculate each expens e as a percent of it. One challenge is that all fee discounts are not recorded in practice records. Many times, veterinarians provide free services (either intentionally or accidentally) that are never shown on the practice's records, thus understating the true level of client discounts. This oversight creates yet another problem: no recorded history of what was done for the patient exists. 5910 \u00b7 Returns and Allowances Returns and allowances are fee amounts the practice returns to clients for disputed work, such as when a client is billed twice for the same procedure or when a client returns dispensed product they believe is not efficacious.

For example, use tax paid to the state and associated with the purchase of non- taxed office supplies could be classed t o account 7750 - Office Supplies. In all cases, the allocated amount of use tax paid on the purchases of capital assets, such as equipment, should be included in the same fixed asset account as the original purchase. For example, $2,100 of use tax paid on the acquisition of a $35,000 ultrasound machine should be coded to account 2000 - Professional Equipment. The total effective capitalized price of $37,100 is then subject to depreciation. Do not segregate sales tax from the cost of supply acquisition. Sales tax assessed by vendors on goods, services, and equipment sold to the practice is part of the asset's cost and is never classed to a separate account.

If such donations have promotional and marketing benefit that advances client acquisition and growth, then consider classing such payments as advertising and marketing expense, even if made to qualified charitable organizations. If you received a direct benefit, such as a meal, then the fair market value of the direct benefit should be coded to the appropriate account (7440, in this example), with the difference coded to charitable contributions. For example, if the practice pays $100 t o a qualified charitable organization and in return receives a meal with a value of $20, then of the $100 expense, $80 should be coded to account 7740 and $20 should be coded to account 7440, assuming there is a business purpose for attendance and business discussion relative to the practice. 7745 \u00b7 Computer Suppl ies Post transactions for peripheral supplies such as cables and small dollar -value software to this account. Minor equipment and software acquisitions may be expensed to this account in accord with the practice capitalization policy.

Inventory Balance @ Cost For DATALINK purposes, inventory value should be a reasonable approximation of drugs on hand (at acquisition cost) at quarterly reporting dates, including partial packages. Exact counts and value are not mandatory; however, from an internal control perspective, it is reasonable to expect that wel l-run veterinary practices will have a good approximation of high value pharmacy items, counts of what is on hand and correlating cost via a regularly maintained practice information management system. Typically, practices do not include white goods in the inventory value. You may need to adjust your inventory cost if you are entering the cost as list price rather than discounted price for markup purposes which is the optimum system for recording cost of products in your practice information management system. VMG strongly recommends practices enter inventory received at list price rather than discounted price. This will enable the practice to utilize the markup module within the software to maintain a constant markup when list prices change. However, when the practice's software determines inventory on hand it will calculate the inventory at the values entered (list price) which will inflate the value of the practices actual inventory cost reported in the software report. Unless the practice is using t he intelligent inventory module which allows the practice to track both actual discounted cost and list price there is no way to know true inventory cost from the software. The practices actual cost of inventory will be inflated 5 to 10% more than actual acquisition cost. It is OK to report inventory for DATALINK at the list price cost as reported in the practice's software. The main need to have actual acquisition cost would be to report on the practice's annual property or income tax returns and the financial statements for the value of inventory and direct costs. These revenue and field definitions are intended for companion animal hospitals. If over 5% of your hospital's total revenue and expenses are attributed to large animal services, best practice would be to use the QuickBooks class system for reve nue and expense categorization. "}
