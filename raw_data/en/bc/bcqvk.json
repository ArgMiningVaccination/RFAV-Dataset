CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFO RMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know ? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Work using SARS -CoV-2 A total dose of ap proximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus -CoV-2 infected macaques via combination intranasal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).167, 189 Macaques did no t exhibit clinical symptoms ; virus was shed from the nose and throat.167 Rhesus macaques are effectively infected with SARS -CoV-2 via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a dose of approximately 700 ,000 PF U (106 TCID 50). 75 76 Rhesus mac aques infected with 2,600,000 TCID50 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases .143 Ferrets infected with 316, 000 TCID50 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show simil ar symptoms to human disease . Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact; direct contact is required to transfer infec tion between ferret s.108 Syrian Golden Hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU via the intranasal route closely resemble human respiratory infection. Uninfected hamsters in close contact with infected hamsters show symptoms within 4 days of exposure .47 Initial experiments suggest that SARS -CoV-2 can infect genetically modified mice containing the human ACE2 cell entry receptor ; infection via the intranasal route (dose: 105 TCID 50, approximately 70,000 PFU) ca uses light infection, however no virus was isolated from infected animals, and PCR primers used do not align wel l with SARS -CoV-2, casting doubt on this study.20 Related Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS) in mice is estimated to be between 67 -540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).73-74 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to doses of Middle East respir atory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) virus between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.10, 62, 120, 224 What do we need to know? Identifying the infectious dose for humans by any exposure route is critical to d iagnostics, decontamination, and model development; animal studies are a plausible surrogate . Human infectious dose by aerosol route Human infectious dose by surface contact (fomite) Human infectious dose by fecal -oral route REQUIRED INFO RMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? What do we know ? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, like ly through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Pandemic COVID -19 has caused 1,363,365 infections and 76,420 deaths103 in at least 1 80 countries and territories (as of 4/7/2020).38, 174, 206 In the US there are 368,533 confirmed SARS -CoV-2 cases across all 50 US states, with 11,008 deaths. (as of 4/7/2020 )103; sustain ed community transmission of COVID -19 is occur ring in the US.23 High -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .137, 152, 164, 213, 223 SARS -CoV-2 is believed to spread through close contact and droplet transmission,42 with fomite transmission likely104 but d.205 Aerosolized virus has been detected in COVID -19 patient rooms, with particle sizes within the human respirable range (0. 25 - 2.5 m).130 Extensive co ntamination of patient rooms indicates the potential for airborne transmission, though to date infectious virus has not been isolated from aerosol samples .171 Limited evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation in the absence of cough , however more work is needed . 5, 171, 8, 119 SARS -CoV-2 is present in infected patient saliva,188 lower respiratory sputum,196 and feces.124 Up to 67% of patients with asymptomatic i nfection may still show CT evidence o f pneumonia .197 Individuals can transmi t SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. SARS -CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract (e.g., throat), and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days .208 Pre-symptomatic226 or asymptomatic18 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2; between 12%79 and 23%129 of infections may be caused by as ymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission . Individuals may be infectious for 1-3 days prior to symptom onset .199 Severe cases are more likely to transmit disease ; most new infections are within households of infected pati ents.135 Undetected cases play a major rol e in transmission. Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were unde tected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.122 Behavior changes may limit spread.88 Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong69 and reduced spread in C hina.109, 132 Modeling suggests that premature lifting of social distancing measures will substantially increase the number of local COVID -19 cases.153 What do we need to know? Identifying the contribution of asymptom atic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contribution of different infection sources (fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces ) are unk nown. Capability of SARS -CoV-2 to be tr ansmitted by contact with fomites (phones, doorknobs, surfaces, clothing, etc.) - see also Experimental Stability Superspreading capacity needs to be refined Updated person to person transmission rates (e.g., R 0) as control measures take effect . What is th e underreporting rate?102 Can individuals become re -infected with SARS -CoV-2? What is the difference in transm issibility among countries? Is the R 0 estimate higher in healthcare or long -term care facilities? How effective are social distancing measures? When will infections peak in various cities and countries? REQUIRED INFO RMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species t o species? What do we know ? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans; t he identi ty of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,229 with a suggested bat origin.5,63, 229 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,44 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated wit h the seafood market.24, 65, 215, 221 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate s pecies is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.166 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown.123, 126 -127 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago.113 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) rec eptor -binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS -CoV-1,211 potentially explaining its high transmissibility; the same work suggests that differences between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit th e therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.211 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.194 Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters , primates and ferrets may be susceptible to infection .47, 108 There is currently no e vidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock101, however there is limited evidence that domestic and wild cats198 can be infected, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown .138, 222 What do we need to know? Little is known about SARS -CoV-2 in non -human hosts. What is the intermediate host(s)? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission? What animals can SARS -CoV-2 infect (e.g., pet dogs, potential wildlife reservoirs)? Can humans transmit to companion animals (e.g., pet cats, dogs)? Can infected animals tran smit to humans (e.g., pet cats , dogs to humans)? REQUIRED INFO RMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to devel op symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Some i ndividuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.116 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.116 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.18, 46, 93, 184, 226 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic42, 168, 184, 226 ; and asymptomatic i ndividuals can have similar amounts of virus in their nose and throat as symptomatic indiv iduals .230 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days . 7, 122, 174 On average, there are approximately 479 to 7.5121 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain. Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.228 Patients can test positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear.228 Patients can test positiv e after recovery and hospital discharge.114 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknown. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Experimentally infected macaqu es were not capable of being reinfected after their primary infect ion resolved.19 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery .115 What do we need to know? While the incubation period is well -characterized, less is known about how long individuals are infe ctious before, during, and after symptoms. Additionally, the possibility of reinfection warrants more research. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? Are individuals infectious after hospital discharge and clinical recovery, or are positive PCR tests only detecting non -infectious virus? Can individuals become re -infected after recovery ? If so, how long after? REQUIRED INFO RMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person ? What do we know? Most COVID -19 cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group. Older individuals and those wit h underl ying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The majority of COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, N = 44,000 cases) .184 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44% - 52% present with fever initially15, 93), cough (67.7%93), fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.43, 50, 99 Headache49 is uncommon. Diarrhea may be uncommon ,99, 121 though lack of appetite may be an early symptom.150 Complications include acute respiratory distress (ARDS , 17-29% of hospitalized patients,54, 99 leading to death in 4-15% of cases54, 99, 195 ), pneumonia,149 cardiac injury (20%179), secondary infection, kidney failure, arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.93,99,195,228 Most deaths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with myocardial (heart) damage.169 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,93, 184 and approximately 5% of patients are adm itted to the ICU.93, 184 Loss of taste and smell appears in 5 -30% of patients who test positive, however ~18% of individuals who test negative also report this symptom . More work is needed .17, 89, 59 Several studies suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is not transmitted from mother to child53, 55, 173, 219, however larger studies are needed. Current modeling suggests the overall case fatality rate (CFR) o f COVID -19 is approximately 2.4%.14 The CFR depends on comorbiditi es; cardiovascular disease, hyper tension, diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.184, 228 The CFR increases with age; individuals >60 are at higher risk of death,184, 228 and >60% of confirmed fatalities have been male.184 In the US, 34% of hospitalizations have been individuals younger than 44 years old.6 Variation in the CFR between countries may be due to demographics, te sting criteria, and how COVID -19 related deaths are defined.147 Children of all ages are susceptible to COVID -19,78 though generally show milde r51, 134 or no symptoms . Up to 28% of children may be asymptomatic.155 Severe symptoms in children are possible ,128 and infant deaths have been recorded.31, 134 Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. In a limited study (n=9) , hospitalized patient s shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 days via the nasal -pharyngeal route ; 50% of patients produced antibodies within 7 days, all patients by 14 days. Antibody production did not correlate with lower viral load .208 In a larger study (n=175) , most patients develop ed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. Elderly patients had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.212 Based on one patient, a productive immune response is generated and sustained for at least 7 days.185 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibody may wane after several yea rs; 214, 32 more data is needed. What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing prioriti es and case definitions vary by location . How long does it take for infected individuals to recover outside of a healthcare setting? Are reductions in CFR over time (e.g., China) an indication of better treatment, less overcrowding, or both? Are pregnant wo men at greater risk of complications during labor?125 How prevalent is loss of smell, loss of taste and gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID -19 patients?

W hen during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relat ively accurate . Confirmed cases are still underreported. US CDC has expanded patient testing criteria to include symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.22 PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared internationally .37, 67, 121, 178, 202, 207 PCR-based diagnost ic assays are unable to differentiate between active and inactive virus. Broad testing in Iceland suggests that ~50% of those who test positive are symptom -free at the time of testing .16, 141 A combination of pharyngeal (throa t) RT -PCR and chest tomography are the most effective diagnostic criteria (correctly diagnose 91.9% of infections).161 A single throat swab detect s 78.2% of infections ; duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.161 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as diagnostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid196, although recent evidence suggests this may not always be the case . 208 More work is needed. RT-PCR tests can identify asymptomatic cases; SARS -CoV-2 infection was identified in 2/114 individuals cleared by clinical assessment.98 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify pati ents at higher risk of severe disease.225 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling labora tories to develop and use tests in -house for patient diagnosis.87 Updated tests from the US CDC are available to states.37, 42 Multiple rapid or real -time test kits have been produced by univer sities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,70 BGI,26 Cepheid192, Abbot,85 and Mesa Biotech.27 The US CDC is developing serological test s to determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2.106 A rapid antibody test by Cellex is now authorized by the FDA . 97, 201 Home tests are being developed, however , none are FDA approved, no r are they useable as a diagnostic . 144-145, 151 Machine learning tools are being developed to predict severe and fatal COVID -19 cases based on CT scans.180 Interleukin -6 levels of >80 pg/mL were associated with respiratory failure in a small study (n=41).94 More work is needed .

Vaccines? What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.93, 139 Over 3322 clinical trials are ongoing , but results are preliminary .61 25 Convalescent sera is being tested at m ultiple sites across the US.140 The WHO is tracking >50 potential va ccines64, and has begun tw o global clinical trials : Solidarity and Discovery 111 that include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine , ritonavir/lopinavir, and r itonavir/lopinavir and interferon -beta.111 Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical tri als supports the efficacy of favipiravir,52 tocilizumab,216 intravenous immunoglobulin,34 and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin.90, 131 Additional work including sufficiently powered clinical trials are necessary to confirm therapeutic efficacy of any of these compounds. Limited, preliminary evidence shows mixed efficacy of chloroquine alone,1 and no efficacy from combination ritonavir and lopinavir.33 Additional work is necessary to confirm these results . Antibody -based therapeutics are planned to start clinical trials in 3 -5 months .60, 83, 183 Teams across the USA are testing passive antibody therapy (convalescent serum35) to patients (FDA Investigational New Drug approval) .86 In a small trial (5 patients)177, convalescent sera administration was followed by clinical improvement.177 Corticosteroids are commonly given to COVID -19 patients228 at risk of ARDS,217 but their use is not recommended by the US CDC.39 Laboratory testing identified 17 repurposed drugs and remdesivir -like nucleoside inhibitors176 with significant antiviral activity ; more research is needed to confirm e fficacy.200 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. No preliminary results are available. Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine ,11 including Johnson and Johnson.105 Moderna has begun phase 1 clinical vaccine trials.165 What do we need to know? In general, the efficacy of various therapeutic options for COVID -19 is unknown, though clinical trial results are beginning to be released.

What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally , SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is un known. SARS -CoV-2 Data SARS -CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surface s for between 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)190 and 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65%RH). Infectious virus c an be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH).57 SARS -CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23oC and 65% RH).190 SARS -CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70oC), but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4oC).57, 159 SARS -CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated; the infectiousness of this material is not known.142 Surrogate Coronavirus Data: Studies suggest that other coronaviruses can survive on non -porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS -CoV)36, 48, and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)81 in air conditioned environments (20 -25oC, 40 -50% RH) . Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity (RH),36, 48, 157, 191 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical o ffice or hospital conditions .191 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up t o 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4oC) on surfaces.36 No strong evidence exists showing reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.136 One hour after aerosolization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25oC, 75% RH) .154 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infec tious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non -porous material.112 What do we need to know?

What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cle aners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. SARS -CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.110 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective ag ainst live virus in lab tests.56 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.148 EPA has released a list o f SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.9 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based204 and ethanol -based66 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment (56oC) is sufficient to kil l coronaviruses,157, 227 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.157 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite (0.02% radiation can several coronaviruses (MHV and CCV) .170 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfectant coronaviruses dried on su rfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.100, 209 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dismozon, and Kors olex are effective at reducing infectiv ity of the closely related SARS -CoV after 30 minutes of contact.156 Coronaviruses may be resistant to thermal inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.186-187 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.80 Hydrogen peroxide vapor can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.163 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.84 What do we need to know? Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. What is the minimal contact time for disinfectants? Does c ontamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? How effective is air filtration at reducing transmission in healthcare, airplanes and public spaces?

What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other rela ted coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses (over 1,000184) demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.172 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers appears high, with up to 20% of heal thcare workers in Lombardy, Ita ly becoming infected.160 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield) .\"40 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve as well as gloves.203 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols204; additional protection, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high -risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilat ion).30 Particular attention should be paid to the potential for transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.92 There is evidence both for130 and against148 the de tection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA via air sampling in patient rooms and other hospital areas . The efficacy of \"homemade\" PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may be used if no other options are available.58, 71, 162 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission Surgical face masks , respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from symptomatic individuals to other individuals . 117, 189, 72 More work is needed. The U S CDC recommend ed wearing cloth face masks in public on 4/3/2020 where social dist ancing measures are difficult to maintain .41 What do we need to know? Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown.

Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with a close relationship to bat corona viruses. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.77 Genomic analysis suggest s that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human -derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.12, 229 Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfe r.\"12 Either scenario is consistent the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS -CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses210; data suggests that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses . 126-127 Additional research is needed. Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,12 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprov e the other theories of its origin.\"12 What do we need to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans woul d aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are there closely rela ted circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2?

What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substituti ons and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific por tions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 20 19. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.13, 24, 158 The mutation rate of SARS -CoV-2 is estimated to be similar to other RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, Ebola, Zika), and is currently calcula ted to be 1.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year (N = 116 genomes).96 Pangolin coronaviruses are closely related to both SARS -CoV-2 and closely related bat coronavirus es; phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is close ly related to pango lin coronavirus.126-127 The Spike protein of SARS -CoV-2, which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the Spike protein of SARS -CoV-1.133 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat 133 and pangolin127 coronavirus. Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8.181 The effect of this deletion on transmission or virulence is unknown. A recent report of virus mutations w ithin patients needs more studies .107 Additional analysis of data suggests the results may be due to experimental methods. 91, 218 What do we need to know? Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed . Are there si milar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence? REQUIRED INFO RMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/7/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 13 Table 1.
