Early research of pediatric integrative medicine modalities shows promise for the treatment of common pediatric conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, acute and chronic pain, headache, and allergy, among others. In light of the growing prevalence of pediatric illnesses and patient complexity, it is crucial to emphasize the patient's overall well-being. As academic centers around the world start to develop pediatric integrative medicine programs, the aim of this manuscript is to briefly highlight evidence of effective integrative treatments in pediatric subspecialties, to describe the establishment of our integrative medicine program, to summarize its early efforts, and to discuss potential barriers and keys to success.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-12-12", "cleaned_text": "Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Academia: Stanford Children's the biologic, psychosocial, spiritual, and environmental aspects of patient wellbeing. Integrative modalities range from mind-body interventions to nutrition. While current biomedical practices have made great strides in the treatment of many conditions, the addition of IM principles and practices can help restore the patient to a state of personal wellbeing and optimal function [ [2](#B2-children-05-00168), [3](#B3-children-05-00168)]. [4](#B4-children-05-00168)]. Throughout this article, the term \"integrative medicine\" (IM) or \"IM practices\" will be employed to refer to the concurrent use of CAM therapies in conjunction with traditional allopathic practice, in order to highlight this emerging practice paradigm in pediatric practice, except where the articles quoted have specifically employed the terminology of the terms \"complementary\" or \"alternative\" medicine. [5](#B5-children-05-00168), [6](#B6-children-05-00168)]. Children with chronic illnesses are significantly more likely to use IM therapies than healthy children [ [7](#B7-children-05-00168), [8](#B8-children-05-00168)]. Integrative medicine is used by more than 50% of pediatric patients with chronic disease [ [2](#B2-children-05-00168)]. [9](#B9-children-05-00168)]. The literature over the last two decades has confirmed the clinical efficacy of certain IM therapies and has demonstrated improved patient outcomes (e.g., improved quality of life, decreased cardiovascular risk factors), symptom relief, and patient satisfaction [ [10](#B10-children-05-00168), [11](#B11-children-05-00168)]. Large systematic reviews indicate potential cost-effectiveness and even cost savings for IM modalities in adult populations, though higher quality studies are needed [ [10](#B10-children-05-00168)]. Similar studies have not yet been published for pediatric patients but are currently underway [ [12](#B12-children-05-00168)]. [13](#B13-children-05-00168), [14](#B14-children-05-00168), [15](#B15-children-05-00168), [16](#B16-children-05-00168), [17](#B17-children-05-00168), [18](#B18-children-05-00168)]. Consuming a myriad of fruits, vegetables, spices, and extracts have shown preventative and treatment potential undergone extensive study utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and is emerging as an effective therapy for pain, anxiety, and depression [ likely even lower in certain ethnic and socioeconomic groups [ [1](#B1-children-05-00168)]. Parents and patients may feel intimidated by clinicians' perceived negative attitudes towards alternative therapies, even though three in four pediatricians believe that parents would disclose this information [ [35](#B35-children-05-00168)]. Improved communication regarding IM therapies would allow for physicians to (1) understand patients' and families' priorities and values in health and illness, and (2) help avoid treatment interactions between CAM and conventional therapies [ [36](#B36-children-05-00168)]. [37](#B37-children-05-00168)]. Helpful to the cause, guidelines for advising patients seeking CAM have been published [ [38](#B38-children-05-00168), [39](#B39-children-05-00168)]. Although clinicians have an ethical obligation to discuss treatment alternatives [ [40](#B40-children-05-00168)], the overwhelming majority of pediatric providers do not feel comfortable discussing CAM with their patients. Both Kemper and O'Connor [ [41](#B41-children-05-00168)] and Sawni and Thomas [ [42](#B42-children-05-00168)] found that less than 37% of pediatricians inquire regarding CAM use while taking a routine medical history; any dialogue regarding CAM is typically initiated by the family. Pediatricians have a positive attitude towards CAM, but desire further education to adequately address patient concerns [ [2](#B2-children-05-00168), [41](#B41-children-05-00168)]. In a national study of 648 pediatricians, less than one in five reported any formal training in CAM, and 84% of respondents desired a continuing medical education curriculum, exhibiting self-awareness of their low familiarity with the topic [ [3](#B3-children-05-00168), [41](#B41-children-05-00168), [42](#B42-children-05-00168), [43](#B43-children-05-00168)]. [44](#B44-children-05-00168)]. The growth of dedicated academic departments and training programs in IM highlight institutional interest and support for IM. 2. Pediatric Integrative Subspecialties in Academia [45](#B45-children-05-00168)]. From an educational standpoint, training in pediatric IM was spearheaded by the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine. The 100-h online Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Residency (PIMR) program was designed to address the lack of IM training available to pediatric trainees [ [46](#B46-children-05-00168)]. The PIMR program teaches residents habits for their own personal wellness alongside an introduction to evidence-based IM principles. This program was adopted by five pediatric residency programs in 2012 as a pilot program. Inclusion of a curriculum on physician wellness in the PIMR program was intentional and necessary. Physician burnout and fatigue is associated with major medical errors and decreased productivity. Furthermore, it has been shown that healthy physicians are more likely to advise patients to follow healthy lifestyle habits and are more effective at motivating patients [ education in a pediatric academic setting has the additional advantage of increasing institution-wide exposure and comfort with IM modalities. [3](#B3-children-05-00168)]. Research into the efficacy of a pediatric integrative care model is often conducted at academic medical centers where patient diversity and research support are available. Due, in part, to increased research, IM approaches are being integrated into the fields of pediatric gastroenterology, pain, neurology, oncology, and pulmonology, among others. Frequently, the multidisciplinary approach afforded by IM can effectively treat symptoms, decrease polypharmacy, and enhance overall wellness in pediatric illness. 2.1. Gastroenterology [55](#B55-children-05-00168), [56](#B56-children-05-00168)]. Herbal medicines, dietary supplements, and special diets are the most prevalent therapies utilized [ [57](#B57-children-05-00168)]. The strongest predictor of CAM use was prior or feared side effects of conventional medicine [ [55](#B55-children-05-00168)]. [58](#B58-children-05-00168)]. Some studies have suggested a modest effect of probiotics, curcumin, and acupuncture in promoting remission in patients with IBD [ [59](#B59-children-05-00168), [60](#B60-children-05-00168), [61](#B61-children-05-00168), [62](#B62-children-05-00168)]. Mind-body interventions also have a limited body of evidence showing benefit in adolescents with IBD. A 2010 study of 67 adolescents with IBD described frequent utilization of prayer (62%), relaxation (40%), and imagery (21%) for disease management [64](#B64-children-05-00168)]. [65](#B65-children-05-00168), [66](#B66-children-05-00168), [67](#B67-children-05-00168)]. Small studies on enteric coated peppermint oil have also demonstrated improvement of pediatric IBS symptoms [ [68](#B68-children-05-00168)]. 2.2. Pain/Perioperative [69](#B69-children-05-00168)]. [70](#B70-children-05-00168)]. Chronic pain can negatively impact a patient's school functioning, sleep, and parent burden (e.g., financial obligations, missed work) [ [71](#B71-children-05-00168)]. Treating chronic pain requires a multidisciplinary approach. The complex interplay between the patient's effective coping skills, parental reinforcement of pain behavior, and patient's mood can all alter and affect patient functioning [ [71](#B71-children-05-00168)]. This patient demographic is, reassuringly, open to an integrative approach to their care. According to a study of 110 pediatric patients with chronic pain (headache, abdominal pain, and musculoskeletal pain) presenting at an academic integrative clinic, 100% of families were interested in additional counseling regarding diet, exercise, sleep, or stress management [ [70](#B70-children-05-00168)]. Further, evidence is emerging for non-pharmacologic treatments for pain. For instance, physical therapy (stretching, trigger point physiotherapy, massage) can relieve headaches, musculoskeletal pain, and chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) [ [72](#B72-children-05-00168), [73](#B73-children-05-00168), [74](#B74-children-05-00168)]. Cotton et al. found that after massage therapy, mean pain scores decreased in over 500 hospitalized children with chronic pain and anxiety [ [75](#B75-children-05-00168)]. Acupuncture and mindful meditation have been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic pain and can decrease opioid usage, but more robust randomized control trials (RCTs) are needed [ [29](#B29-children-05-00168), [76](#B76-children-05-00168)]. [77](#B77-children-05-00168), [78](#B78-children-05-00168), [79](#B79-children-05-00168)]. Newer technologies, such as virtual reality devices, show significant promise in minimizing discomfort with vascular access and minor procedures [ [80](#B80-children-05-00168), [81](#B81-children-05-00168)]. 2.3. Neurology/Neurodevelopmental Pediatrics [82](#B82-children-05-00168), [83](#B83-children-05-00168)]. In a survey of 327 pediatric neurology patients at the Mayo Clinic, over 40% used CAM, and melatonin for sleep disorders was the most commonly used therapy [ [84](#B84-children-05-00168)]. A 2014 survey of 206 pediatric neurology patients in a Canadian children's hospital diagnosed with epilepsy, headache, and cerebral palsy illustrated high use of multivitamins, massage, and chiropractic therapies (89.9%, 47.1%, and 36.8%, respectively); most practices were reported as helpful [ [85](#B85-children-05-00168)]. Among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), special diets are the most common form of CAM utilized according to eight independent studies [ [57](#B57-children-05-00168), [86](#B86-children-05-00168)]. [87](#B87-children-05-00168), [88](#B88-children-05-00168)]. Furthermore, screening and treating comorbid sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, bruxism, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome can indirectly improve headache [ [89](#B89-children-05-00168)]. Neurofeedback has documented potential in treatment of epilepsy and headache [ [90](#B90-children-05-00168), [91](#B91-children-05-00168)]. Meditation, breath work, and relaxation activities have reduced school absences in patients with headaches, migraines, and seizures [ [83](#B83-children-05-00168)]. 2.4. Pediatric Oncology [57](#B57-children-05-00168)]. Mind-body therapies are readily accessible and low risk, with several trials showing decreased side effects of cancer therapy, increased patient self-confidence, and improved coping skills [ [92](#B92-children-05-00168)]. The largest study of pediatric oncology patients (1063 patients) found that 71% utilized IM modalities and only 4% reported adverse events [ [93](#B93-children-05-00168)]. The most common reasons cited by patients for using IM were to aid in treating cancer, symptomatic relief, support of conventional treatment, and management of side effects [ [94](#B94-children-05-00168), [95](#B95-children-05-00168)]. [96](#B96-children-05-00168), [97](#B97-children-05-00168)] and lifestyle changes [ [98](#B98-children-05-00168), [99](#B99-children-05-00168)]. The mechanism responsible may be by aliment-induced reversible epigenetic modification or the protective effects conferred by a diet high in fiber and antioxidants [ [20](#B20-children-05-00168), [100](#B100-children-05-00168), [101](#B101-children-05-00168)]. Establishing healthy habits in children to focus on healthy nutrition, mind-body interventions for stress reduction, quality sleep, and generous physical activity may be paramount in decreasing overall risk of some cancers (colon, lung, breast, and prostate) in later life [ [102](#B102-children-05-00168)]. 2.5. Asthma and Allergy [103](#B103-children-05-00168), [104](#B104-children-05-00168), [105](#B105-children-05-00168)]. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Cramer et al. in 2014 highlighted yoga as a supplementary intervention for asthma patients to improve symptoms and quality of life [ [106](#B106-children-05-00168)]. Breathing exercises and breath retraining techniques such as Buteyko breathing, yoga/pranayama, and physiotherapy have decreased bronchodilator usage [ [107](#B107-children-05-00168), [108](#B108-children-05-00168)]. Mark describes a multitude of integrative therapies as effective for pediatric asthma, including: (1) mind-body therapies to reduce anxiety and stress, lowering immune response and sympathetic activity; (2) proper prenatal and childhood nutrition that is high in fruits and vegetables; and (3) exercise and yoga to improve regimen adherence and decrease anxiety [ [109](#B109-children-05-00168), index (BMI) and poor nutrition using mind-body therapies to influence caloric consumption, sedentary or stressful lifestyles, and depression-associated symptoms [ [114](#B114-children-05-00168)]. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been used as an adjuvant in pediatric obesity management [ [115](#B115-children-05-00168)]. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has shown preliminary efficacy in youths with anxiety disorder and mindfulness based stress reduction programs in urban youth have improved psychological functioning and decreased negative effects of stress [ [33](#B33-children-05-00168), [116](#B116-children-05-00168)]. Furthermore, a recent study has proposed mechanistic pathways of action of acupuncture in alleviating cardiovascular disease [ [117](#B117-children-05-00168), [118](#B118-children-05-00168), [119](#B119-children-05-00168), [120](#B120-children-05-00168)]. 3. Integrative Medicine at Stanford Children's Health 3.1. Program Background and History [Figure 1](#children-05-00168-f001)is a diagram of the program's accomplishments. 3.2. Clinical Work 3.3. Research [3](#B3-children-05-00168)] and detailed results from the Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Residency (PIMR) pilot program [ [46](#B46-children-05-00168), [121](#B121-children-05-00168)]. A recent study found immersive virtual reality safe and effective for treating complex regional pain syndrome [ [80](#B80-children-05-00168), [122](#B122-children-05-00168)]. This has prompted further research on using virtual reality for other types of chronic, acute, and procedural pain. Intraoperative acupuncture for patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy was found to be feasible, decreased postoperative pain, and increased return of diet [ [77](#B77-children-05-00168)]. A pilot study on yoga for adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease found yoga to be widely acceptable, feasible, and safe [ [123](#B123-children-05-00168)]. For further details and a summary on research productivity and ongoing projects please see [Table 1](#children-05-00168-t001). [69](#B69-children-05-00168), [124](#B124-children-05-00168)]. Therefore, developing research techniques to study multimodal interventions is needed to adequately study the integrative medicine approach as a whole [ [125](#B125-children-05-00168)]. This may include examining cost effectiveness and resource utilization (emergency visits, urgent care visits, and hospitalizations) in patients seen in a PIM program versus standard care. 3.4. Medical Education [121](#B121-children-05-00168)]. To supplement the online curriculum offered by PIMR, the faculty developed a pediatric integrative medicine and wellness elective for pediatric residents who wanted in-depth exposure to integrative medicine in practice. The elective is currently offered as either a two-week or four-week in-person rotation. Residents taking the elective participate in the subspecialty PIM clinics (average four to five half-day clinic sessions per two-week rotation). Required readings and hands-on didactic sessions (average 4 h per two-week rotation) include lectures about plant-based nutrition and mind-body medicine. A field trip to a natural foods store provides the venue for a hands-on discussion of herbs and supplements. Residents are also asked to choose one integrative modality to experience for themselves to improve their own health. Meditation, massage, acupuncture, and yoga have been the most popular modalities that residents explore. Residents enrolled in the four-week elective are required to complete the 100-h PIMR online curriculum in addition to the above activities. The PIM elective at Stanford Children's has become one of the most popular electives, with approximately 20% of the 76 categorical pediatric residents participating annually. Sample Case Presentation (Identifying Details Changed for Patient Privacy) 4. Discussion 4.1. Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Academia [44](#B44-children-05-00168)]. Within children's hospitals, patients are acutely sick, and in the outpatient setting, the incidence of children with complex and chronic medical problems has grown. According to a national survey performed by the Centers for Disease Control, in 2009, 15.1% of all children in the United States had special health care needs, up from 12.8% in 2001 [ [137](#B137-children-05-00168)]. These children often have multiple subspecialties involved in their care and their subsequent care coordination and communication between multiple consultants can be challenging. Specialists tend to focus on their organ system of interest, and the holistic approach to the care and healing of the child may be overlooked. Integrative medicine may help bring together all aspects of care since PIM is a blend of mainstream therapies with the other aspects of wellness. Further, our PIM faculty members are trained in both a pediatric subspecialty and integrative medicine. This affords a unique opportunity for specialized clinical care, education, and research in these integrative pediatric subspecialties. 4.2. Drivers for Success [44](#B44-children-05-00168), [138](#B138-children-05-00168)]. Given that integrative medicine at times can include treatment modalities that may not be well known to mainstream medicine, the faculty group also emphasizes evidence-informed treatment modalities to the extent available and emphasizes patient safety. Lifestyle recommendations that have minimal side effects such as good nutrition, sleep hygiene, physical activity, and mind-body modalities are often cornerstones of each treatment plan. When research on treatment efficacy in a pediatric population may not be available, providers extrapolate data from adult populations and utilize shared-decision making with families, and use the safety-effectiveness rubric to discuss and document efficacy [ [139](#B139-children-05-00168)]. Every effort is made to utilize available resources to ensure the safety of a treatment recommendation, especially in regard to botanicals or supplements. Further, pharmacy consultations are sometimes required in patients who have significant polypharmacy. [123](#B123-children-05-00168), [132](#B132-children-05-00168)]. The novel conception of the pediatric integrative medicine fellowship has additionally increased clinical services and education efforts. The weekly didactic conference (available in person and by webinar) had the unanticipated benefit of bringing together PIM providers within Stanford and the larger community. Continuing education courses for the pediatric community also stimulated community building and aided in patient referrals. As students, residents, and other community providers increase their exposure to and knowledge of integrative modalities, these treatment options become part of the norm, and then truly \"integrated\" into conventional care. Therefore, medical education and teaching are important keys to success. 4.3. Challenges and Financial Considerations [140](#B140-children-05-00168)], this will hopefully translate to novel prevention models for pediatrics. 4.4. Future Directions [139](#B139-children-05-00168)]. Continued growth in these areas will require ongoing institutional support for faculty time, resource allocation, and financial support. 5.
