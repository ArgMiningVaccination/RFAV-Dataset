The case brings the U.S. monkeypox case count to 32, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The county will not disclose the patient's personal information due to privacy reasons. Public health officials have identified people who had direct contact with the patient and are monitoring them for symptoms. The CDC is also working with airline and health officials to contact airline passengers who may have come into contact with the patient on a flight from Mexico to Dallas. \"We have been working closely with the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services and have conducted interviews with the patient and close contacts,\" said Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Dr. Philip Huang. \"We have determined that there is little known risk to the general public at this time.\" Though the case is the first for Dallas in the virus' current outbreak, it's not the area's first encounter with monkeypox, which is native to Central and West Africa. [Nearly one year ago](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/07/22/what-is-monkeypox-heres-what-you-should-know-about-texas-first-case-of-the-virus/), a Dallas hospital treated a patient who contracted the virus while traveling, preparing local experts for potential future cases. Nearly 800 confirmed cases of the virus were reported to the World Health Organization between May 13 and June 2 as the virus continues to spread in countries to which the disease is not native. What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is a virus transmitted from animals to humans that causes symptoms similar to the now-eradicated smallpox virus, although monkeypox is less contagious and less severe. It spreads from animal to person or person to person through close contact with lesions, body fluids and contaminated materials like clothing and bedding. Around one to two weeks after infection, most patients begin to experience fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes, according to the CDC. Between one to three days after developing a fever, patients get a rash that often starts on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. Lesions from the rash go through several stages before scabbing and falling off. The illness lasts around two to four weeks. This current outbreak looks a little different than past virus flare-ups. Some patients aren't experiencing flu-like symptoms, and are instead just reporting rashes in certain parts of the body, such as the genitals. Those subdued symptoms make the virus harder to diagnose, said Dr. Prathit Kulkarni, assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. Recent cases have also been largely reported in men who have sex with men, although Kulkarni emphasized that people of any sexual orientation could contract the disease. What treatments are there? Most people with healthy immune systems infected with monkeypox will experience mild symptoms that go away on their own. People who are at high risk of severe disease \u2014 including immunocompromised patients, children younger than 8 or people who are pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 may want to contact the CDC about treatment options. The best way to prevent the spread of monkeypox is by taking preventative measures, such as avoiding contact with sick people or animals that could harbor the virus and using personal protective equipment when caring for someone who has monkeypox. The Food and Drug Administration approved one vaccine, called Jynneos, for the prevention of monkeypox, and it is currently being evaluated for potential use in people who are at risk of exposure to the virus. Vaccines used to stop smallpox also provide protection against monkeypox, according to WHO. [Dallas is ready if monkeypox comes "}
