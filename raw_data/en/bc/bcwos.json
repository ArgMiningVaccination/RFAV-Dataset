Despite numerous studies and scientific evidence disproving this link, many people still believe that vaccines can cause autism. In this blog post, we will separate fact from fiction and provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision about vaccines and autism. The Origins of the Vaccine-Autism Myth The vaccine-autism myth originated from a 1998 study published in The Lancet by Andrew Wakefield. The study claimed that there was a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine and autism. However, the study was later found to be fraudulent, and Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. Since then, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the link between vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence to support the vaccine-autism myth. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that there is no link between vaccines and autism. The Importance of Vaccines Vaccines are one of the most important public health interventions in history. They have saved countless lives and prevented the spread of deadly diseases. Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that can fight off specific diseases. By getting vaccinated, you not only protect yourself but also those around you who may be more vulnerable to disease. At Nao Medical, we believe in the importance of vaccines and their role in preventing disease. We offer a range of vaccines, including the MMR vaccine, to protect our patients from preventable diseases. Common Questions About Vaccines and Autism - Can vaccines cause autism?
