Once you are approved for transplant you will begin preparing your body for collecting your stem cells Next your stem cells will be collected for use during your transplant. There may be some words in this book that you have not heard before . Please look at the glossary at the back of this book for help . If you have questions , please ask your doctor or nurse. 11 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceInsurance Coverage We will call your health insurance company , speak with them about your treatment, and find out how much of the stem cell transplant they will cover. To do this we will need copies of all your current medical insurance cards. We will also: Get coverage information about all the parts of the transplant treatment, including the hospital stay. Give you the coverage information and possible costs. Check the costs of the medicine that you will need. Help you to find financial help if needed. For further information or clarification of your coverage and benefits, we encourage you to contact your insurance carrier directly. Please kno w that a stem cell transplant costs a lot of money. In the event there is any amount left unpaid by the insurance carrier(s), the remaining balance becomes t he responsibility of you and/or your family. Pre-Transplant Evaluation & Testing The pre-transplant evaluation includes several tests to show that you are in good health and can safely have the transplant. These tests will also serve as a \"baseline\" so they can be compared to the same tests completed after the transplant. You will need th e following tests: Blood & Urine Tests - these are done to see how well you kidneys, liver and bone marrow are working. Chest X -Ray - An x -ray of your lungs will be taken. Dental Exam - You will need to see your dentist for a complete exam and cleaning. Any problems, such as cavities or infections will need to be taken care of before starting the transplant process . MUGA Scan and /or Echocardiogram -measures how well your heart pumps blood through your body. For a MUGA Scan a dye is put into your bloodstr eam and then pictures are taken. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) -You will breathe in and out of a tube and it will measure how much oxygen your lungs can hold and how much oxygen gets to you r blood. Infectious Disease Tests - Your blood will be taken and checked to see if you had contact with certain di seases or viruses in your lifetime and to check for any current infections . CT scans, MRI, PET scans, and bone scan s- these may need to be do ne to monitor your disease. Your transplant nurse will let you know which tests are needed. 12 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainencePsycho -social assessment - As part of the pre -transplant testing, it is required you see the transplant social worker or psychologist. The reason for the assessment is to help you and your family with any special needs you may have. Social workers and psychologists can help you cope with social, emotional, family and financial issues you encounter during your transplant. It is recommended that your care partner come with you. Please know that the psychosocial assessment is done to meet your and your family needs. Depending on the assessment, more appointments may be needed. Once all of these tests are done, you will meet with your doctor and care coor dinator to go over the results , have your questions answered, and sign consents for the stem cell collection and transplant. Fertility You should know that the high dose chemotherapy given during a stem cell transplant may cause you to become infertile. Depending on where you are in your life you may want to consider egg harvesting or banking your sperm for the future. See the resources s ection for further fertility treatment information and resources . Induction Therapy Induction therapy is the first line of treatment for your cancer . It is used to help put your disease into a remission before your stem cell transplant. During induction, you may get chemotherapy, which is a treatment with drugs that kill cancer cells. Some of the side effects from the chemotherapy can be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, low blood counts , which can possibly lead to anemia, infecti ons, bleeding, hair loss and feeling tired. Be sure to let your nurse know when you are having any side effects. Mobilization Generally the peripheral blood stem cells are collected for use in an autologous transplant. However, bone marrow collection s can be performed if needed. Since stem cells are found in our blood but in low numbers, we need to \"mobilize\" the stem cells out from the bone marrow into the bloodstream . This is done using a medicine called Filgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae). We will then collect the stem cells using a process called Apheresis . During apheresis blood is moved from your vein and into the apheresis machine, which filters out the stem cells from the blood . The rest of the blood is then returned your vein. The stem cells that are taken out are saved , frozen, and will be given back to you later during the transplant. 13 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceNeupogen\u00ae Shots Filgrastim (Neupogen\u00ae) is a medication that will make you r body make extra stem cells and move those stem cel ls into the blood stream so they can be collected. Filgrastim is given as a shot into the fatty tissue with a small needle. You or a family member will need to learn to give these shots. Your nurse will teach you how and where to do the shots. They wil l need to be given two times each day, once in the morning and once in the evening, about 12 hours apart until the stem cell collection is done. There are generally few side e ffects with Filgrastim but you may experience : Redness, burning, bump or bruise where you received the shot Low grade fevers Bone pain in your back, chest, legs or arms Call your doctor or nurse if you have a fever of 100.5 degrees or higher You may take (2) Extra Strength Tylenol\u00ae every 4 -6 hours if needed. Call your doctor if your pain is not better after taking Tylenol\u00ae. Your blood counts will be watched closely while taking the Filgrastim . Steps for Giving Shots Step 1 1. Take the medic ine from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before giving it so that it gets warm. 2. You may put ice on the shot area to numb it for a few minutes before giving the shot 3. Wash your hands with antibacterial soap and water. 4. Gather all of the supplies: a. Medicine -filled syringe b. Alcohol swab Step 2 5. Find the site for the shot:* a. Back of arms b. Abdomen, except near the belly button and the waist c. Upper thighs 6. Clean the site with an alcohol swab by rubbing in a circle *Change the site each time you get a shot 14 Step 3 Giving the Injection: 7. Hold the syringe in the hand you will use to give the shot and carefully remove the cap from the needle shot. 8. Use the other hand to pinch the skin that was cleaned. 9. Hold the syringe the way you would hold a pencil, insert the needle either straight up, and down (90 -degree angle) or at a slight angle (45-degree angle) to the skin. 10. Gently push needle through the skin. 11. After the needle is in, let go of the skin 12. Slowly push down the plunger all the way, until all of the medicine is gone. 13. Remove the needle from the skin and gently hold an alcohol pad on the injection site Do not rub 14. If there is bleeding apply a bandage. 15. Place the syringe in a puncture proof container; Do not replace cover on the needle 15 16 The Journey of you Stem Cells Apheresis Catheter To collect your stem cells, a Central Venous Catheter will be placed into a large vein that runs under your collarbone. It is a thin plastic tube with three tubes on the end. It will be used to draw blood, to collect th e stem cells. It will stay in place and will be used while you are in the hospital to get the transplant. 17 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceYour catheter will be put in at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in the Interventional Radiology Department. This will be scheduled by your nurse. You will be given medicine before to help you relax, and you may only have clear liquids for 4 hours before your appointment. You cannot drive the day of this procedure and you will need someone to bring you home. After your catheter is in place : You will go to the doctor's office 1 -2 times per week for line care. The nurses at your doctor's office, collection center, or the nurses on the transplant unit at the hospital may use the catheter. DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE ELSE TO USE IT. Do not allow your lines to go under the level of water in a bathtub or swimming pool. Keep the area clean and dry; be sure to cover the site with plastic before taking a shower. Your nurse will show you how to do this. Call your doctor or nurse with any signs of infection: Fever 100.5 degrees or more, chills, swelling, red areas or pain Notify your nurse if any blood is in the tubing - the fluid in the tubes should always be clear. Your catheter may be taken out before going home from the hospital or you may go home with it in place and have it taken out when your platelets reach 50,000 and when the doctor decides you no longer need it. Emergency Catheter Care Neostar Triple Lumen Catheter 18 Cap at end of line missing Make sure line is clamped. Clean end of line with an alcohol wipe for at least 30 seconds. Place a new cap on tightly or if no cap, wrap with sterile gauze. Call your doctor or nurse. Swelling of face, neck or chest Call you doctor or nurse. There may be clot around your line. Redness, drainage or bleeding Call your doctor or nurse Fever above 100.5 degrees and/or chills Call you doctor or nurse. These are signs of infection. Damage to the tubes, such as leaks Clamp the tube between the hole and where the tube exits your chest. Cover the hole with sterile gauze. Call your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. Line Comes Out of the Chest Apply pressure with gauze or a clean washcloth to stop the bleeding and tape in place. Call your doctor or nurse. Sudden chest, neck, shoulder pain or hard time breathing Make sure the lines are all clamped. If not, pinch it off or fold it over to clamp it. Lie on you left side with your head down, stay like this and have your care partner call your doctor. 19 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceStem Cell Collection The stem cell collection is done as an outpatient at the Apheresis Cent er, located on the third floor of the professional building attached to the main hospital, Suite 365. Infusion Center Parkside 1875 Dempster Street, Suite #365, Park Ridge, IL 60068 P: 847 -723-5070 When you get there on the first day of collection, a blood test will be done to find out how many stem cells there are in your bloo d. This test takes about 2 hours to get results from the time it is drawn. You can wait at the center, go out for coffee or breakfast or even go home if you live very close. The nurse will call you with the results. The collection will be started when your blood counts show that you have enough stem cells in your blood. The cell collection takes about 3 -6 hours. All of the stem cells needed may be collected on the first day, or it may take 2 -3 days on the collection machine to get the right amount of cells. The most common side effects of the cell collection are numbness or tingling of the lips, face, and hands. This is caused by too low levels of calcium in your body. Tell your nurse as soon as you are feeling this and they will give you calcium to correct the problem. It is good to eat a diet high in calcium for the few days before the collection. You can do this by eating more dairy foods such as milk, yogurt, and ice cream. You will also need to eat 4 -5 Tums\u00ae tablets on the morning of colle ction.

Bone marrow contains stem cells that are capable of producing the different types of blood cells in our body. Stem cells divide to form more stem cells, or mature into white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets. Red Blood Cells (RBC): RBC's contain hemoglobin (Hgb), a protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the cells in the body. White Blood Cells (WBC): WBC's are the body's defense against infection. There are many different types of WBC's. Each of the different types of white blood cells plays a specific role in destroying foreign organisms to your body. Platelets (PLT): PLT's are sticky, disc -shaped cells that allow the blood to clot, w hich prevents excess bleeding. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants treat many diseases in both children and adults. In a blood and marrow transplant , healthy stem cells are given to replace damaged bone marrow. Damaged bone marrow can be caused by: 1. Bone Marrow Failure 2. Destruction of marrow by a disease 3. Chemotherapy and radiation Why Do I Need a Transplant? If you have a blood disease or if your bone marrow is failing, a transplant can help you by replacing your damaged stem cells with healthy ones. A transplant can also allow the doctor to give you a very high dose of chemotherapy (with or without radiation) to kill your cancer cells. This high dose treatment destroys your bone marrow, so the stem cells are given back as a \"rescue\". People with the following p roblems may need a transplant: Aplastic Anemia Multiple Myeloma Hodgkin's Disease Lymphoma Leukemia Pediatric solid tumors (Neuroblastoma) Immune System Diseases Myelodyspla stic Syndrome 10 A stem cell transplant is a procedure used to \"rescue\" the bone marrow that has been destroyed by high doses of chemotherapy and/ or radiation therapy. There are different types of stem cell / bone marrow transplants. The name of each type describes who t he cells came from. They may be called by different names, but all of the types of transplant have the same goal, to get rid of bad cancer cells and replace them with good cells. Autologous Transplant \u2014the stem cells are collected from the patient before the high -dose chemotherapy and returned to the same patient as part of the transplant. Allogeneic Transplant - the stem cells are collected from someone other than the patient. The donor may be a family member or someone that is found to match the patien t from a registry of unrelated donors. Syngeneic Transplant - the stem cells are collected from the identical twin of the patient and then transplanted to the patient Further on in this book, different types of transplant will be explained in more detail. Source of Stem Cells Before you begin your treatment we will need to collect the stem cells. While stem cells are made in the bone marrow they can also be found in your blood stream . These are called peripheral bl ood stem cells (PBSC) . Stem cells in the marrow are collected through a bone marrow harvest, which is done as surgery with the patient put to sleep . Blood stem cells are collected from the veins by a process called apheresis, which is done as an outpatient. Most stem cells are collected by apheresis which is easier and has fewer side effects . Care Partner During the transplant, you will need to have one person who will help you; this person will be your care partner. It can be a family member or a friend. Your care partner will need to come with you when you see the doctor and when you go to the clinic. They can call and talk to your doctor or Bone marrow Soft, spongy bone Hard, compact bone 11 nurse for you if needed , and help you deal with stress , your instructions at Discharge, and your p ost discharge care. You must have someone , probably your Care Partner, stay with you for the first 1-2 weeks after your transplant. They will need to help you at home with your medicines, shopping, cookin g and anything else you may need. They will also help you with stress, your instructions at discharge, and your post discharge care, Transplant ID card You will receive a transplant ID card that contains your name, date of transplant, and your Doctor's phone number. Please keep this in your wallet or on your person at all times. It will serve as a valuable resource should you be admitted to the emergency room or have transplant related issues that would require someone to contact your doctor.

This allows your doctor to give you high doses of chemotherapy (with or without radiation) to kill any remaining cancer cells in your body. Your own cells will then be thawed and infused back to you 24 hours after the chemotherapy and/or radiation finish. It is hoped that your cells will engraft, mature and be healthy once again. It is our goal that this transplant will keep your disease in remi ssion for an extended period of time or even possibly cure your disease depending on your diagnosis. Getting ready for transplant can be a hard time for patients and their families. How much time it takes between your first visits with the transplant doctor and when you get your stem cells transplanted can be a long time. Some patients may need more chemotherapy or radiation to further shrink their disease before transplant. Tests are needed to find out if you a re able to have a transplant. How long it will take depends on your disease status and your general state o f health. Every patient does not require every lab test, every organ function test or every consult appointment listed below. First Step: Meeting with the Transplant Team Initial consult: - Your medical history is reviewed, and information about stem cell transplants is given. - A physical exam is done. This appointment will help you to decide if a transplant is the right treatment for you. - The nurse coordinator will conduct an educational overview during this visit. - A financial coordinator will contact you with any insurance issues .

The time it takes for each step of the transplant may be different for each person. While the dates may change the process will be the same. You can follow this timeline throughout the booklet to see where yo u are in your transplant journey. Autologous Transplant Timeline First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admission Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ Maintainence 14 Allogeneic Transplant This type of transplant is when another person donates stem cells to you. It might be from a brother or sister (known as \"matched sibling\"), an identical twin ( known as syngeneic), or from a volunteer (known as a \"matched unrelated donor\"). This type of transplant allows your doctor 2 choices of chemotherapy, with or without radiation, to fight your disease . Depending on your disea se and your current health condition, the doctor will tell you which type is best for you. An allogeneic transplant that uses high dose therapy is called \"myeloablative\" and the goal is to wipe out all your disease bone marrow and replace it with your don or's. The other allogeneic transplant type uses less toxic doses, is called \"mini\" or \"non -myeloablative\" and its goal is to weaken your marrow and mix it together with your donor's. Getting ready for transplant can be a hard time for patients and their families. How much time it takes between your first visit with the transplant doctor and the day you have your transplant can be a long time. The search for a donor can take a l ot of time and can be hard on your emotions. Some patients may need more chemotherapy or radiation before transplant to further shrink their disease. Many tests are needed to find out if your body is strong enough for transplant. How long this part takes depends on your disease status and your general state of health. Every patient does not require every organ function test or every consult appointment. First Step: Initial consult: - Your medical history is reviewed . Information about the transplant process is shared to help you and the doctor know if a bone marrow transplant is the right treatment for you . - A physical exam. - The nurse search coordinator will conduct a brief educational overview . - A financia l coordinator will contact you with any insurance issues .

You will have about a week to rest after the cell collection and before you are admitted to the hospital for your transplant. During that week you will see your doctor to review the transplant treatment. You will s ign consents for treatment in your physician 's office. 23 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceAdmission to the Hospital You will need to stay at the hospital for the transplant and will be there for about 3 -4 weeks. You will have your own private room designed for transplant patients. These rooms have special filters to keep the air clean and extra filters on the faucets and s howers . It is important that you do not remove any of these filters as they are there for your protection. Each room has a bed, c hair, private bathroom, phone, and television. There is a lso small kitchen area that has an ice machine, refrigerator, microwa ve and blender that you can use. Things you may wish to bring to the hospital: Comfortable clothes - it is a good idea to get dressed every day . Sweatpants and shirts that button or zipper up the front work well. You may bring your own pajamas or use a hospital gown for the night. Jewelry - Please do not bring any valuable jewelry . The hospital cannot be responsible if it is lost. Rubber soled shoes or slippers for daily walks in the halls. Hat, scarf, turban or wig. Soap, toothpaste and shampoo - you ma y bring your own or use the ones supplied by the hospital. Toilet paper and tissue - the hospital will provide , but you may also wish to bring in your own softer brands An electric razor (no other razors can be used). Pillow, blanket or comforter. Pictures of family or friends. Snacks in Ziploc bags that you can keep in your room (dry cereals, crackers, and cookies ). Items to help pass the time Laptop Cell Phone Books, magazines , CD / DVD player / Radio Hobbies : knitting, stitching, crossword puzzles Visitors Your family and friends are an important part of the support you need during your transplant and recovery and can visit with you while you are in the hospital . There are no set visiting hours, but you will need to rest and not get tired out by visitors. Your care partner can stay with you for as much time as she/he wants. Please limit the number of visitors in your room to help prevent infection and allow you to get enough rest. 24 Friends and family should not visit if they are sick, think th ey may be getting sick (sore throat, cough, sniffles), or have the following: Cold, flu, upper respiratory infection, or any known infection Infectious rash, shingles, skin infection, or open sores on their hands Recent exposure to an infectious disease Chicken pox in the last 6 weeks or a rash that looks like chicken pox Flu vaccine in the last 2 weeks Oral polio in the last 6 weeks All visitors Must wash their hands before going into your room Should not use the bathroom in your room. There are public restrooms available for their use. Are welcome to bring you cards and gifts. However, fresh flowers and plants are not allowed in your room because the dirt and stagnant water can sometimes carry harmful germs. It is a good idea to let your family know abo ut this restriction. The Hospital Routine The nurses at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital are specially trained to care for transplant patients. It is these nurses who will be with you every day; therefore, it is important for you to let them know of an y concerns you have during your stay. There are many different staff members involved in your care that may be coming and going throughout your time in the hospital. During your hospital stay we will closely monitor your progress to see how your treatment is going. Some things we will monitor during your stay : Vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature will be taken several times a day Blood work - your blood will be drawn from your catheter at least once a day. This is done to monitor your bloo d counts, kidney function, liver function, and other things such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Your transplant physicians may adjust your medications based on these results. Fluids - we will monitor how much you eat, drink, and go to the bathroom. I t is important to keep track of the fluids you are taking to be sure you are getting enough fluids for good hydration and not retaining too much fluid. Weight - the staff will weigh you regularly to monitor your fluid and be sure you are getting enough calories. Symptoms - the staff will ask you often if you are having any nausea, pain, or other problems. It is very important to keep all of your transplant team informed of how you are doing. If problems are reported early, actions can be taken quickly to prevent them from getting more serious. 25 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceIt is important to be as active as you can and even exercise while you are in the hospital. Daily walks with family outside of your room are helpful. There are many germs in the hospital so you will need to wea r a mask and gloves when going outside of your room and throw them away when you come back into your room. You should also w ash your hands when you come back into your room each time. Showering/ Bathing Because you have a Central Venous Catheter, each day while you are in the hospital, you will need to take a special bath using Chlorhexidine (CHG) wipes. You will receive instructions on how to use these wipes, and your nurse or nursing care technician wil l be available to help you. These are special moist wipes used to lower the number of germs commonly found on your skin. By decreasing the number of germs, you decrease your risk of developing an infection. After using the CHG wipes your skin will feel sti cky until the CHG dries. Allow CHG to air -dry. This helps to lock in the additional layers of germ fighting protection You may take a shower while you are in the hospital. Make sure your line is covered before you shower and be careful and avoid getting t his area wet. After your shower you will still need to use the CHG wipes to help protect your skin from germs. It is important that you wait 1 hour after your shower before you use the CHG wipes. Waiting for one hour will allow your skin pores to return to normal and prevent the CHG from getting into the deeper layers of your skin and causing irritation. Important things to remember while you are using CHG wipe DO NOT TOWEL DRY! DO NOT use other skin supplies from home Wait 1 HOUR after showering before using the CHG wipes 26 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceConditioning Therapy/ Preparative Phase You will start high dose chemotherapy or radiation on the first day. It may be given over a few days or over a week. The choice of c hemotherapy treatment depends on the type of cancer and its stage. Your doctor will decide what medications and doses are best for your disease. You will learn how the drugs work and how you will receive them. Side Effects of Chemotherapy The high -dose chemotherapy can cause different side effe cts as it kills cancer cells and normal cells. Most of these side effects will happen within one to two weeks after the chemotherapy. Other side effects may not occur until weeks or month s later. You r body will repair the damage from the chemotherapy, but it will take time. You will be given medications to help prevent some of these side effects and y ou and your care partner will also be taught ways to reduce and treat these side effects. Muscle ac hes and feeling like you have the flu Fever Nausea & Vomiting - you will be on anti -nausea medication but it is important to talk to your nurse about how you are feeling so we can prevent nausea from becoming vomiting. Drinking fluids, avoiding strong odors, and eating frequent small meals can help with your nausea. Loss of appetite / Loss of taste - this is a common side effect but nutrition is important to help your body recover. Think of food as the medicine you need to get better. Trying to eat someth ing each meal is important to help re-build your body and recover from transplant. Diarrhea - it is common to experience diarrhea because of the effect of chemotherapy on the intestine. However, frequent diarrhea can cause irritation and dehydration. Diarrh ea can also be the sign of an infection and samples will be taken to check for bacteria. Mouth sores - our mouths naturally carry a lot of bacteria. Therefore it is important you keep your mouth clean so that bacteria do not enter your blood stream when you begin to develop mouth sores. You should use the provided medicated mouth wash and should brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush. Avoid using floss and eating crunchy foods that could scrape your mouth. Hair loss - See the resources section for more infor mation. Fatigue / Feeling very tired - fatigue can be caused by stress, lack of exercise, poor diet, and low red blood cell counts. You will be given blood transfusions as needed and you will get more energy as your cells begin to engraft. Fatigue may be so mething you have for several months after transplant and you may need to adjust your routine and save energy for those things you want to do. Pain - pain can be controlled with medication and we are committed to pain management. Let your nurse know if you are in pain so we can work to find the right medication and dose for you. Let your nurse or doctor know as soon as you begin having any side effects or problems. 27 Low Blood Counts The chemotherapy you receive during the transplant will lower your red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Hemoglobin -the part of the red blood cells that carry oxygen through your body. When these are low, it is called anemia . This may make you feel tired, short of breath and cold all the time. Platelets - part of the blood that clumps together to form a clot. When your platelets are low, you may bruise easily, bleed from your gums when brushing your teeth or have noseblee ds. Any cuts or injuries will bleed more during this time. White Blood C ells (WBC ) - are a part of you r immune system that fights infection. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is the total number of white blood cells you have to protect you from infect ions. When your ANC is lower than normal it is called Neutropenia . When you are neutropenic, you are at risk for infections. You will need to be careful during this time to avoid getting sick. Blood Test Normal Level White Blood Cells (WBC) 4000 - 10,000 Hemoglobin (HGB) 12 - 16 Platelets 140,000 - 300,000 28 Neutropenic Precautions When your white blood cells count is low you are at risk for getting an infection. Some ways to prevent getting an infection include: Washing your hands frequently - This is the best way to prevent infections . o You, your family , and visitors should wash hands with soap and warm water often. o It is important to wash before eating and after using the bathroom. Do not go into crowded areas without wearing a mask until your doctor tells you it is safe. Stay away from people who are ill No kissing, hugging and hand shaking No contact with anyone who has gotten vaccines recently Brush teeth 2 -3 times per day with so ft toothbrush only Use an electric razor so you don't get cuts Clean cuts or scrapes and use antibiotic ointment on them No gardening or working with plants, no fresh cut flowers No cleaning up after your pets You will need to eat from a special diet, called a Low Bacteria or Neutropenic Diet. During this time you are not allowed to eat fresh, uncooked vegetables such as lettuce and tomatoes. All vegetables must be cooked. Only thick skinned fruit that can be scrubbed prior to opening may be eaten, such as bananas, oranges and melons. Thin -skinned fruit, such as apples, pears, and grapes must be cooked prior to eating, canned fruit is okay. Deli meats and cheeses are also not allowed during this time. See the Low Bacteria Diet , Guidelines for Eating Fresh Fruits and Vegetables , and Transplant Patient Food Safety Guidelines in the resources section of this handbook for more detailed diet information . Signs of an Infection: Fever 100.5 degrees or higher Chills Cough with colored phlegm Pain or burning when you urinate Any areas of redness or swelling Mouth sores, white patches in your mouth or a sore throat Call your doctor or nurse right away if you notice any of the above 29 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ Maintainence Stem Cell Transplant/ Infusio n A few days after the hig h-dose therapy is complete, your will receive your stem cells . The day you get your stem cells is called Day 0. If the stem cells were frozen they will be thawe d and given to you in your hospital room. The infusion can take about 20 minutes and is similar to a normal blood transfusion. There are few side effects of the infusion of stem cells. Your nurse and or doctor will discuss some of the possible side effects with you before your infusion. T here is a preservative in wit h the cells that will cause a funny taste in your mouth. This preservative has a smell like garlic and for about 24 hours after getting the cells others will smell this when they enter your room, but you will not smell it. Also, y our urine may be pink col ored for about 24 hours after getting the cells. Engraftment After your infusion the cells will travel into your bone marrow and go to work making new blood cells. This may take a nywhere from ten days to three weeks after your transplant . During this time, you may need to get bags of blood and platelets. T here will be signs that your stem cells are growing (engrafting) and beginning to produce new blood cells. As this starts , you may notice pain in your bones, especially your pelvis, lowe r back, and thighs. As your blood counts begin to rise, your white blood cells will start to fight and help stop infections. If you had fevers while your white blood count was low, they may get better now. Your doctor or nurse will let you know when you may stop taking antibiotics and when you can begin your normal activities again. You will no longer need platelet transfusions and will notice that yo u do not bruise or bleed as easily. You will not feel as tired and will soon no longer need red blood cell transfusions. You also will notice that other side effects you have been feeling will begin to get better. 30 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceDischarge / Going Home You will be discharge d from the hospital only when: Your white blood counts have returned to normal You are able to eat enough calories each day You are drinking enough fluid You have someone to help you care for yourself at home You can take all of your medicines by mouth Your nurse will give you special written instructions (discha rge instructions) to follow at home. Your nurse will go over the discharge instructions with you and your care partner and answer all of your questions. You will also be given information on what prescription medications you should take at home. Some of your symptoms may be treated usin g over- the-counter medications. Y ou should c heck with your doctor before taking any new over - the-counter or prescription medication. The central line in your chest may be remove d before you go home, or you may go home with it until your platelets are high enough to have it safely taken out . Please do not hesitate to call us with any questions or concerns. We are here to help. While at home Follow your discharge instructions Follow the low bacteria diet. Y our doctor will let you know when you can stop Take your prescribed medications Check with your transplant doctor before taking over-the-counter medications Tell your transplant doctor about any new medications being prescribed b y other doctors Call your transplant physician if you have any symptoms, questions, or concerns When in doubt check it o ut! 31 - Recovery - After your discharge from the hospital you will need to rest and recover at home You will have regular appointments with your transplant physician to see how you are recovering. Know that you can contact your transplant doctor or nurses if you have any questions or concerns during your recovery. Your doctor may start you on maintenance therapy to help maintain your cancer remission You and your doctor together will decide when it is a good time to go back to work. You may need to return part time at first, working fewer hours per day or fewer days per week. 32 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ Maintainence First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceOnce you get home, you may find that you may not feel as well as in the hospital. This is because you will need to do more to take care of yourself at home. It is important to eat well, drink fluids, get enough sleep , and be as active as you can when you get home. Follow -up Care It is important for the transplant team to see you often to be sure you are making good progress and not having any new problems. An appointment will be set up for you to see your doctor shortly after you have been released from the hospital. At first you will visit the doctor 1 -2 times per week. Around 3 months after the transplant, your doctor will run tests to check on your cancer. He will then meet with you to go over the tests and the results of the transplant. At this time, you will talk about wh at happens next. Some patients may not need any more treatment. Some patients may go on maintenance t herapy , which is chemotherapy given at small doses for up to a year or more. You will have regular visits for many months to check your disease and for any long -term side effects. Even after you have returned to seeing your oncologist, the transplant team wil l receive updates about you and follow you. Eating & Drinking You will need to follow the Low Bacteria Diet found in the resources section of this handbook while you are at home. Your doctor will let you know when you may return to your normal diet. Eating a well -balanced, high calorie, high protein diet is important in helping you recover from the transplant. If you are having difficulty eating 3 meals a day because of nausea, or if you get full easily, try eating 5 -6 small meals a day. Drinking fluids is also very important to your recovery. You should drink plenty of water and juices but you can also get flui ds through soups, Jello\u00ae, and ice cream. Gatorade and other similar drinks are excellent in helping to replace salts and minerals if you are having problems with diarrhea or vomiting. Infections While your risk of infection has decreased after your stem cells have engrafted , your immune system will take much longer to completely recover. During this time you will be more prone to infections or viruses. There are many things you can do to help prevent infection: Wash your hands frequently with soap and wa ter Follow a Low Bacteria Diet Avoid those who are sick, even those with colds Avoid home construction projects as molds and fungus are released into the air Avoid soil, lawn waste, or compost Avoid cleaning up pet waste 33 Vaccinations You will need vaccina tions after your transplant to help your immune system recover . It is important for you to listen to your transplant doctor's recommendations as to what vaccinations you should receive and when you should receive them. Getting a vaccination too early, befo re your immune system has recovered, could make you very sick. Do NOT get any vaccinations without first consulting with your transplant doctor. For general vaccination guidelines after transplant see the Immunization schedule in the resources section of this handbook . Shingles Shingles is caused from the same virus that causes chicken pox. Chicken pox usually occurs during childhood and is then dormant in the body for many years. Patients whose immune system is suppressed after a bone marrow transplant a re at risk of the virus becoming active again. Once the virus is active, shingles will appea r as pain or burning . Then raised, red, fluid filled blisters will emerge on the skin. While shingles can appear anywhere on the body it generally follows a nerve and occurs as a strip of rash or pain from the back to around the front of the chest or stomach on one side. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of these signs of shingles. Sun Exposure The chemotherapy and/or radiation and other drugs given during the transplant can increase the sensitivity of your skin to sunlight. Protect your skin with sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher when outdoors even on overcast days. Wear protective clothing such as hats, sunglasses and long-sleeved shirts a nd pants. Smoking and Alcohol The chemotherapy and/ or radiation can cause lung damage; therefore, it is important to avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. Alcohol can also be damaging to organs such as the liver. Ask your transplant doctor when you can resume drinking alcoholic beverages. Anxiety and Depression Many patients feel depressed at some point during their recovery . Fears of disease recurrence, changes in your family and work roles, and loss of energy are some issues you may experience during your recovery that could lead to anxiety and depression. Community support groups such as the American Cancer Society may help. Other patients of stem cell transplants are also a good support. Ask your nurse or doctor for names of patients who are willing to talk to you. 34 First Visit/ Consultation Insurance Approval Evaluation & Testing Induction Therapy Mobilization Stem Cell Collection Hospital Admit Conditioning Therapy Transplant Hospital Discharge Recovery/ MaintainenceSex and Fertility Your sex activity and fertility is something you should consider both before and after your treatment. During your transplant you will receive high doses of chemotherapy and other treatment medications. A n unplanned pregnancy could not only affect your health, but also the medicines you will be taking might be harmful to a developing baby. Therefore it is recommended that both men and women who are sexually active; should use some form of birth control whi le you are recovering from transplant. Unfortunately, the high doses of chemotherapy used during transplant put both men and women at high risk of infertility after their treatment. It is common for women to go into early menopause. Some signs of this a re not having your period, hot flashes and mood swings. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these signs. For patients who want to have children , talk to your doctor before any treatment to discuss the possibility of infertility and help plan for the fu ture. Additional information on fertility treatment can be found in the resources section in this handbook. You might notice a decrease in your sexual desire after your bone marrow transplant. As your hormone levels return to normal and as you regain your strength and endurance, your sexual desire should return to normal. The following are some general guidelines regarding sexual activity: You may begin having sexual relations with your partner when you feel well enough and your pla telet count is 20,000 or more. Women may have vaginal dryness after chemotherapy and may need to use a water soluble lubricant such as K -Y\u00ae jelly. You should NOT perform oral sex on your partner for at least 6 weeks post transplant. Oral sex is safe if you are the recipient. Wash your genital area carefully before and after sex to decrease your chance for infection Because of the risk of infection, you shoul d NOT have anal sex. Women should not douche. Long Term Recovery It may seem to take a long time before you start to feel better. It may take up to a year to feel like you again. Some patients describe adjusting to a \"new normal\". It is important for you and your family to know that recovery takes time and not to try to rush it. Try to keep positive during this time and listen to your body. It is also importan t to stay active. E xercise such as walking may help you get your energy level back faster. If you have any concerns while you get better, talk with your doctor or nurse about them. 35 There are some problems that may result from the stem cell transplant . These problems may happen or continue even after you seem to be getting better. These may include: Feeling numb or tingling in your hands or feet Loss of nails Body aches Fatigue Dry mouth, skin, or eyes Hearing loss or ringing in the ears Poor vision Upset stomach Taste changes You may not have any of these long term side effects, but should tell your do ctor or nurse about any problems that yo u have. Rarely, patients may develop a different cancer because of high -dose chemotherapy. Recovery after transplant can sometimes be a bumpy road. Most times there are small problems or infections that may require you to return to the hospital because they cannot be managed as an outpatient. Don't become too discouraged because this is very common and it is part of your recovery. Do not hesitate to call us with any questions or concerns and f rom all of us on your transplant team , we wish you well during your recovery. MEDICAL TERMS GLOSSARY Absolute Neutrophil Co unt (\"ANC\") \u2014 Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that helps keep the body from getting an infection. We look at how many neutrophils are in your blood to see when the transplant is beginning to work , or to see when your body heals from chemotherapy treatment . (See Engraftment, Neutrophil) Allogeneic Transplant (al-o-je-n'ay -ik) \u2014 Also known as an Allo transplant. Stem cells are taken from someone other than you. The other person (\" donor \") may be a fa mily member or someone else who is found to be similar to you . Anemia \u2014 The red blood cells carry oxygen through the body . When red blood cell numbers are too low, it is called anemia. This can make you feel tired, short of breath and cold all the time. Apheresis (af -re\u00b4sis ) \u2014 The procedure used to remove stem cells from the peripheral blood. Blood is moved from a vein, through a tube , and in to an apheresis machine. This machine filters out the stem cells and returns the rest of the blood to the body through a nother vein. The stem cells that were removed are saved for use later in the transplant. Autologous Transplant (aw-to'l-o-gus) - Also known as an Auto Transplant. In an autologous transplant, the patient's own stem cells a re collected before chemotherapy and are later given back during transplant. The patient is both the donor and recipient of the stem cells. Benign \u2014 Not cancerous Bone Marrow \u2014 The soft tissue inside of large bones where stem cells and blood cells are created . Stem cells in the bone m arrow create white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. Bone Marrow Harvest - A surgical procedure used to collect bone marrow . Bone Marrow Transplant (\"BMT\") \u2014 A BMT is done to replace damaged cells from cancer with new healthy stem cells . A bone ma rrow transplant may be autologous or allogeneic (Also s ee Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant . It can also be referred to as a Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Transplantation (HPCT). Chemotherapy \u2014 A drug that destroys cancer cells. Chemotherapy is used before a stem cell transplant. The kind of drugs used in chemotherapy depends on your disease, your age, and your health. Central Line Catheter \u2014 The Cent ral Line is a catheter, or thin plastic tube that is put into a large vein that runs near your neck. Your stem cells can be collected ( Apheresis ) through this tube. The catheter will stay in place through your transplant and will be taken out when your doctor decides you no longer need it. Collection \u2014 See Apheresis Colony Stimulating Factors (CS Fs) \u2014 Proteins that are made by the body to speed up the growth of blood cells. CSF's can be given by a shot to help the body make more blood cells in preparation for collection by Apheresis. Conditioning \u2014 The process of getting a patient ready to have a marrow or blood cell transplant is called conditioning. Chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is often used. It is also known as a preparative regimen. Discharge Planning \u2014 Preparing to leave the hospital. Staff will look at what you will need at home and give you instructions for getting better while at home. This plan will also tell you when you should see your doctor. Donor \u2014 A donor is a person who can give stem cells from their blood to be used for your transplant. This donor c an be a family m ember, like a brother or sister , in an allogeneic transplant . You can also be your own donor , in an autologous transplant . Engraftment \u2014 The point when the stem cells given to you during your transplant start t o grow and make new blood ce lls Fatigue \u2014 The feeling of being tired and having little energy Filgrastim (G -CSF) \u2014 The man-made version of a normal human protein that increases the number of blood cells in the body. (See Colony Stimulating Factors (CSFs) ) Graft -Versus -Host -Diseas e (GVHD) \u2014 This can develop after an allogeneic transplant if the immune cells from the donor see the recipient's ti ssues as foreign . GvHD can arise even when the transplant comes from a matched related donor. This does not happen when you get your own cel ls in an autologous transplant. Harvesting (See Apheresis or Bone Marrow Harvest ) - Collecting/ removing stem cells from the body Hematopoietic Cells - Blood stem cells found in the bone marrow and blood. These cells can grow into red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. Also called blood -forming cells or progenitor cells Hemoglobin (Hgb) - The part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen HLA Typing - HLA stands for Human Leukocyte A ntigens. These proteins are present on each individual's cell and allow the immune system to recogn ize 'self' from 'foreign'. HLA typing is used to match patients and donors for st em cell and organ transplants. It is also called HLA testing. Immune System - The body's system to fight against disease. Induction Pha se -This part of the transplant is the regular chemotherapy you get before your transplant. Induction is done first in order to shrink the cancer or disease as much as possible before transplant. Infusion -An infusion is when fluid is introduced into your blood through a vein . Red blood cell, platelets, and stem cells are all given through infusion. Low Bacteria Diet (see Neutropenic Diet) Lymphocyte \u2014 A type of white blood cell. It is an important part of the body's immune system. Maintenance Tre atment - Your doctor may talk to you about continuing treatment after your transplant. Usually this is treatment in a smaller dose given for up to a year or more to help keep your transplant successful. Malignant - Cancerous Marrow (See Bone Marrow) Mobilization - Is the treatment given to prepare you for your transplant. This is done to get the stem cells to move from the bone marrow into the blood stream where the cells can be collected . Myeloablative Transplant -A stem cell transplant which uses very high doses of chemotherapy and/ or radiation prior to transplantation with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Neupogen\u00ae - The brand name for Filgrastim. See Filgrastim (G -CSF) Neutropenia -A condition that occurs when your white blood cell count is very low. White blood cells work to fight off infections in your body . When you are neutropenic, you are at risk for getting very sick with infection. Neutropenic Diet - A special diet for patients who have a lo w nu mber of white blood cells. Following a neutropenic diet can help protect you from bacteria and other harmful organisms found in some food and drinks . You cannot eat fresh, uncooked vegetables on this diet. You can eat fresh fruit, but only if it has thick skin, like bananas, and only if the fruit has been washed on the outside. Fruit with thin skin, like apples or grapes, must be cooked before you can eat it. You cannot eat deli meats and cheeses on this diet. See the resources section for more detailed diet information. Neutrophil -Neutrophils are a typ e of white blood cell that help protect the body from infection. We look to see how many neutrophils are in your blood to tell us if you are engrafting after transplant, or healing a fter chemotherapy. Non-Myeloablative Transplant - Also known as a \"mini -transplant \" or \"low intensity\" or \" reduced intensity\" transplant. This type of transplant uses smaller doses of chemotherapy and/o r radiation therapy . Peripheral Blood Stem Cell s (PBSC ) - While most stem cells are found in your bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells are those found circulating in your blood stream throughout your body. PBSC are easier to collect than those found in the bone marrow. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Tran splant - Stem cells found in the blood are collected through a procedure called apheresis. The stem cells are then frozen and stored . Next, the patient will receive treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy . After treatment, the collected peripheral blo od stem cells are given back by to the patient infusion. (Also see Bone Marrow Transplant) Plasma - the liquid part of blood. Platelet -a type of blood cell that helps stop bleeding by forming clots. Prophylaxis - a measure taken to maintain health and prevent disease. You will be given prophylactic treatment as part of the transplant procedure. Medications, such as anti -viral and anti -bacterial, will be given to you in order to help stop an infection before one occurs. Radiation Therapy -Treatment wit h high -energy rays to destroy or shrink cancer cells. Recipient - The person receiving the infusion of stem cells is known as the recipient. Red Blood Cell - A type of blood cell that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. Re-Infusion -The process of putting stem cells back into your blood after treatment for your disease or cancer. Recovery -The process of healing after your stem cell transplant. It will take time to get back your strength, energy and appetite. Relapse - When signs and sympto ms of disease return. Remission - When signs and symptoms of disease are not present . Stem Cells - Unspecialized cells that are able to produce many different types of cells. These master cells are able to divide throughout their life and create new cells. These new cells can become highly specialized and will take the place of old cells that die or are lost. Stem cells contribute to the body's ability to renew and repair its tissues. There are man y different types of stem cells including; embryonic, ocular, and hematopoietic. For your transplant, w e are concerned with the adult hematopoietic (blood) stem cells . Stem Cell Transplant - In your case, stem cell transplant r efers to the use of blood or bone marrow stem cells as a treatment for c ancer or other diseases. T Cell - A type of white blood cell that plays an important part in the immune system. Tissue -Materials from your body, including skin, hair, nails, blood and urine. Total Body Irradiation (TBI) -Radiation treatment that is given to the entire body with high -energy rays to destroy or shrink cancer cells . Tumor - Any strange growth of cells. Tumors can be caused by cancer cells (malignant) or non -cancer cells (benign). White Blood Cell - A blood cell that helps fight infec tion and is part of the immune system.

Please check with your transplant physician before eating other fruit and vegetables. 1. Select fruits and vegetables without spots, bruises or damage . Fresh fruits and vegetables should look and smell fresh. 2. A caregiver, not a patient, should do all preparation and washing of produce. 3. Wash hands thoroughly before handling fresh produce. Us e plenty of hot water and soap and wash for at least 20 seconds. Always use clean cutting surfaces. Use a clean knife. 4. Wash all fruits and vegetables (including bagged pre -washed salad greens) thoroughly under running cold water before using. 5. Using a clea n vegetable scrubber, scrub produce that has thick skins or rinds (such as melons, potatoes) to remove excess soil. 6. Wash the outside of all fruits and vegetables even if the produce is to be skinned or peeled. Bacteria on the outer s kin can be transferred to the inside of fruit and vegetables when cutting with a knife. 7. Do not wash fruit and vegetables with produce rinses, soaps, detergents, or chlorine bleach solutions. Produce can absorb these cleaning agents. 8. Refrigerate produce promptly. The refrigerato r must be clean and cold (40\u00b0F or colder). 9. Throw out fruits and vegetables that have been stored too long. Throw out fruits and vegetables that are slimy or show mold. Food Safety Guidelines for Transplant Patients These food guidelines are intended to supplement immune -suppressed patient diet guidelines, which identify higher risk foods. By following safe food practices, patients and caregivers can reduce the risk of food -borne illness. All handling, cleaning, and preparing of meats and pr oduce should be performed by someone other than the immune -suppressed patient. Safe Food Handling 1. Purchase a food thermometer. They are available at most kitchen stores and have either a dial read or a digital read. 2. Caregivers preparing food should alway s wash hands frequently - before, during, and after food preparation. Use plenty of hot water and soap and wash for at least 20 seconds. 3. Hold food at safe temperatures: hot food above 140\u00b0F and cold food below 40\u00b0F. 4. Cook meat until well done and measure the final temperature with a thermometer. Red meat should reach an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F and poultry to 180\u00b0F. 5. Thaw meat, fish, or poultry in the refrigerator away from fruits and vegetables. Place on a dish to catch drips. Cook defrosted meat right a way; do not refreeze. If you are in a hurry, you can thaw in the microwave - but you must cook the meat immediately and thoroughly clean the microwave to stop the spread of bacteria. 6. Never leave food that can spoil out of the refrigerator for over two hour s. 7. Wash the tops of canned foods before opening. Clean the can opener before and after use. 8. During food preparation, do not taste the food with the same utensil used for stirring. 9. Cook eggs until the whites and yolks are completely hard cooked. 10. Never taste food that looks or smells strange. Grocery Shopping 1. Check \"sell by\" and \"use by\" dates. Select only the freshest food product. 2. Do not buy/avoid damaged, swollen, rusted, or deeply dented cans. Check that packaged and boxed foods are properly seal ed. 3. Do not buy/avoid foods with any mold present. 4. Avoid foods from delicatessens, including prepared salads and sliced meats and cheeses. In the bakery, avoid unrefrigerated cream and custard containing desserts and pastries. 5. Avoid foods from self -serve bulk containers or bins. 6. Avoid yogurt and ice cream products from soft serve machines. 7. Avoid tasting free food samples. 8. Avoid cracked and unrefrigerated eggs. Liquid pasteurized egg product may be used instead of eggs in the shell. 9. Purchase frozen and refr igerated foods last, especially during the summer months. 10. Store groceries promptly after purchase. Never leave perishable food in the car. Dining Out...Is It Safe? (Please check with your transplant physician to see when it is appropriate to start) 1. Eat ear ly to avoid crowds. 2. Since it is hard to know the cleanliness of the handler and produce preparation, do not eat raw fruits and vegetables when dining out. 3. Avoid high -risk food sources: salad bars, delicatessens, buffets, smorgasbords, potlucks, bake sales, fast food restaurants, and sidewalk vendors. 4. Check the general conditions of the restaurant environment. Are the plates, glasses, and utensils clean? Are the restrooms clean and stocked with soap and paper towels? How the manager and employees take care o f the restaurant may tell you how clean they are when preparing the food.

Hair usually thins and falls out over a short period of time. This can be stressful unless you are ready for it. Your hair will fal l out but it will begin to grow back in the weeks and months after the transplant. The new growth may not be the same color or texture as your original hair. As your new hair grows back, use a mild shampoo such as baby shampoo. Stay away from harsh prod ucts such as hairspray, dyes, curling irons and hot rollers. There are various options available for hair loss. Some people will feel most comfortable choosing a wig, others may choose head coverings like a scarf or head wrap . The goal is to choose what will make you the most comfortable and create a natural look. You may want to get a wig before treatment or hair loss begins, so it can more easily be matched to your own hair color and style. It is a good idea to bring a friend or family member with yo u for support and help with the decision. Most insurance companies will cover wigs. Ask your doctor to write a prescription and/or letter for a hair or cranial prosthesis , not a wig. This will let your insurance know that this is for a medical condition , not a cosmetic one. Also, be sure the receipts sa y prosthesis and not wig .

Fertility Treatment Patients' fertility can be affected from a stem cell transplant . Recovery after BMT can take months to years; so many patients are not physically or psychologically ready to consider parenthood for several years after transplant. However, a pre -transplant discussion of options to preserve fertility might help you plan for your family's future. Preservi ng Fertility in Women There are several ways to try to preserve fertility in women, but most remain experimental, with unknown success rates. Some options are not appropriate for certain patients, depending on the type of cancer. Embryo Freezing: Eggs are removed from the patient and fertilized in a test tube with the sperm of a partner or donor. The resulting embryos are then frozen and stored. Egg Freezing: Some women opt to have the eggs frozen unfertilized, particularly if they are not in a committed re lationship. Later, the eggs can be thawed and in vitro fertilization attempted. Other options for becoming a mother after cancer treatment include using donor embryos or eggs, having a surrogate (where another woman carries the child), or adoption. Preser ving Fertility in Men Fertility preservation is much easier, cheaper and more effective for most men. It simply involves collecting a sample of semen and freezing it. Sperm must be banked before any chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy begins in order to avoid storing damaged sperm. The sperm can be thawed later and used for intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. Resources Fertility Centers of Illinois 866-364-1418 www.fcionline.com Multiple locations in Illinois.
