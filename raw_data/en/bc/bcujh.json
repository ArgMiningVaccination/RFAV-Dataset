It can be given at 13-18 years if not received at an earlier age. Tdap can be given regardless of the time since receiving a previous Td-containing vaccine. The [Td booster](http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Td-Tetanus-Diphtheria-Vaccine-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx)is used in persons who should not get the pertussis vaccine. - Meningococcal: The [meningococcal conjugate vaccine](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Meningococcal-Vaccines-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx)is recommended for all preteens and teens at 11 to 12 years old, with a booster dose at 16 years old. Teens may also be vaccinated with a [serogroup B meningococcal vaccine](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/MenB-Vaccines-What-You-Need-to-Know-VIS.aspx)(2 or 3 doses depending on the brand), preferably at 16 through 18 years old.

The HPV vaccine is given as a 2-dose series before age 15. Both girls and boys should receive 2 doses of the vaccine to prevent HPV-related diseases. Teens 13 years and older who either did not get any or did not receive all of the HPV vaccines when they were younger should complete the vaccine series. Adolescents older than 15 at the start of the vaccination series and young adults need 3 HPV shots for full protection. - Influenza: All teenagers (and everyone else 6 months of age and older) should be vaccinated every year with the [influenza vaccine](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/The-Flu.aspx)as soon as it becomes available in the community.
