While pharmaceutical drugs and/or medical procedures can help treat these effects, there are many home remedies for head injury that are just as effective, or can supplement the benefits of medications. The [brain has the ability to heal naturally](https://www.flintrehab.com/how-to-heal-brain-damage-naturally/) after sustaining trauma through the use of various types of homeopathic remedies. This article will discuss the benefits of home remedies for head injury and some of the most effective ways to boost recovery. Benefits of Using Natural Remedies for Brain Injury Damage to different areas of the brain can cause a variety of [secondary effects](https://www.flintrehab.com/side-effects-of-traumatic-brain-injury/) that can prevail long after the initial injury. While medication may help temporarily treat the effects of a TBI, it does not always address the root cause of the issue. This is where natural remedies for brain injury can help fill in the gap. Some of the most common [long-term effects](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2021/12/traumatic-brain-injury-effects.php) that occur after a brain injury include: [Headaches](https://www.flintrehab.com/headaches-after-brain-injury/)and/or migraines [Dizziness](https://www.flintrehab.com/dizziness-after-head-injury/) - Imbalance - Nausea or [vomiting](https://www.flintrehab.com/vomiting-after-head-injury/) - Difficulty with [memory](https://www.flintrehab.com/how-to-improve-short-term-memory-after-brain-injury/)and/or concentration [Fatigue](https://www.flintrehab.com/fatigue-after-brain-injury/) - Anxiety and/or [depression](https://www.flintrehab.com/brain-injury-and-depression/) [Spasticity](https://www.flintrehab.com/spasticity-after-tbi/) [Medication](https://www.flintrehab.com/medications-used-for-traumatic-brain-injury/) is a common but complex type of treatment after brain injury. Studies have shown that individuals have a [higher risk](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01041.x) of experiencing idiosyncratic reactions (adverse effects with unknown origins) to medication after a brain injury than others. Unwanted side effects are one of the main reasons many survivors may desire alternative treatments for traumatic brain injury. Fortunately, there are various natural remedies that are great for treating post-TBI secondary effects. Many of these natural remedies offer benefits that conventional medicine typically does not, such as boosting the production of [Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4722554/) (BDNF). BDNF is a neurotrophic protein that promotes the development, maintenance, and [regeneration of neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2893579/) (brain cells). It is also an essential factor in [short-term and long-term memory processing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12201640/) and [neuroplasticity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17911219/). Neuroplasticity is the [brain's ability to rewire itself](https://www.flintrehab.com/how-does-the-brain-repair-itself-after-a-traumatic-injury/) by strengthening existing neural connections and creating new ones. It is best stimulated through high repetition of exercises or [massed practice](https://www.flintrehab.com/massed-practice/). Stronger neural connections improve the communication between your brain and the rest of your body. Promoting BDNF and neuroplasticity can be accomplished through different home remedies such as acupuncture or music therapy, just to name a few. Additionally, natural remedies for brain injury are usually more [cost-effective](https://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/journal/economic-evaluation-complementary-and-alternative-medicine) than conventional medicine or procedures. This, along with the promotion of neuroplasticity and the production of BDNF, makes using home remedies an excellent option for TBI recovery. Top 10 Home Remedies for Head Injury While home remedies for head injury provide many benefits, they should not be used as replacements for your doctor's advice. If you are interested in pursuing a holistic approach, it's important to speak to your doctor before adding anything new to your recovery plan. Additionally, keep in mind that while using home remedies exclusively can boost recovery, they can also be very beneficial when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Once cleared by your doctor, you can try different natural remedies for brain injury recovery. This can include: 1. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a popular natural remedy after brain injury. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5294361/) have shown that acupuncture promotes the production of BDNF. It can also help relieve many TBI effects such as [migraines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7748202/) and dizziness. In fact, many survivors have reported [significant improvements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653595/) even after severe traumatic brain injuries. 2. Vitamins Vitamins are essential nutrients the body needs to develop and function properly, especially during [brain injury recovery](https://www.flintrehab.com/vitamins-for-brain-injury-recovery/). Having a healthy, balanced amount of vitamins in your diet can help reduce TBI effects such as fatigue. While it is best to obtain vitamins straight from [nutrient-dense foods](https://www.flintrehab.com/best-foods-for-brain-injury-recovery/), there are supplements available. Consult with your doctor before adding any new supplements to your [post-TBI diet](https://www.flintrehab.com/nutrition-therapy-for-traumatic-brain-injury/) to make sure they are safe for your condition. 3. Brain-Healthy Foods Food is not only essential to obtain the vitamins you need, but it also provides fuel and energy for the body. After a head injury, the brain may require even more fuel to heal and repair itself. Incorporating [brain-healthy foods](https://www.flintrehab.com/best-foods-for-brain-injury-recovery/) into your diet is important. This can include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants to help reduce inflammation in the brain and stimulate the production of BDNF. Brain-healthy foods you can try include salmon, blueberries, avocados, and curcumin. 4. Herbal Teas One of the most popular natural remedies for brain injury is [herbal tea](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-herbal-teas). Tea can help relax the nervous system and boost cognition. Most teas (such as [green tea](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224499000448)) contain caffeine, but there are many caffeine-free herbal teas including chamomile, ginger, and peppermint varieties. Ginger in particular can help relieve nausea and reduce inflammation after a TBI. Passionflower tea is also helpful in reducing anxiety. Different herbal teas offer many benefits, but be sure to check with your doctor before trying any new tea to ensure the ingredients don't interfere with your current medication. 5.

In a placebo-controlled study, results showed that aromatherapy can help [reduce nausea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30670276/). The essential oils used in aromatherapy such as lavender can also help with [anxiety and depression ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/)after brain injury. While most essential oils are safe, they are not regulated by the FDA. Consult with your doctor before participating in aromatherapy to ensure it does not interfere with other medications. 6. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy After a head injury, the brain may require a higher supply of oxygen to heal and maintain itself. This can be obtained through hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This therapy involves lying in an enclosed chamber and breathing pure oxygen for about 60-90 minutes. Studies have shown that oxygen therapy also helps [reduce inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3231802/) of the brain tissue and can be more effective when combined with other types of therapy. Still, be sure to talk to your doctor first to discuss any potential health risks or concerns. 7. Craniosacral Therapy [Craniosacral therapy](https://www.flintrehab.com/craniosacral-therapy-for-traumatic-brain-injury/) is a special type of light touch bodywork that can help alleviate some of the effects of a brain injury including fatigue, anxiety, and other cognitive challenges. It can also help to relieve tension in the neck and other areas in the body that may have sustained trauma. This is a great alternative treatment for traumatic brain injury. 8. Aquatic Therapy Another natural remedy for brain injury is [aquatic therapy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699052.2020.1825809). It's a type of physical therapy that takes place in a warm pool. The water makes your body lighter and easier to move while still providing resistance. This provides survivors with limited mobility a way to exercise with more ease. Aquatic therapy also helps improve balance, and increase strength, and promote blood flow, which are all helpful for TBI recovery. 9. Music Therapy [Music therapy](https://www.flintrehab.com/tbi-music-therapy/) is another way to treat the effects of a brain injury naturally. It can help stimulate the brain, encourage neuroplasticity, and improve cognitive and motor functions after TBI. To harness the benefits of music therapy, it helps to use neurorehabilitation devices such as MusicGlove. [MusicGlove](https://www.flintrehab.com/product/musicglove-hand-therapy/) helps survivors stay engaged and achieve high repetition of exercises by combining music, gaming, and therapy all into one device. 10. Interactive Metronome Therapy A promising technique for treating cognitive problems after brain injury is [Interactive Metronome Therapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24059443/). This is an online program that challenges an individual to synchronize a range of hand and foot exercises to a precise computer-generated reference tone heard through headphones. The goal is to match the rhythmic beat with repetitive motor actions. This can help improve various secondary effects of TBI such as coordination, focus, attention, and motor control. Natural remedies provide many benefits and can be a great addition to your brain injury recovery process. However, be sure to consult with your doctor before trying any new home remedy to ensure it is safe and suitable for you.
