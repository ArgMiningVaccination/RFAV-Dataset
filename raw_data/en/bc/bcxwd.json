Foraging FAQs What is wildcrafting? Wildcrafting is the age-old art of gathering wild plants and mushrooms for food and medicine. It's synonymous with foraging. This practice is in our blood\u2014our ancestors all ate wild foods and prepared medicines from healing plants. - Is it truly sustainable to forage wild plants? That depends on how and what you gather. When I forage, I focus on a particular array of plentiful, generous, and nourishing plants\u2014the wild weeds, the common flora, and the invasives. I strongly encourage you to do the same! These plants are some of our most superb medicinal allies and nutrient-dense wild foods. And these feral, non-native, \"weedy\" plants are the most sustainable options out there. See our article on [Ten Wild Foods for Beginners](https://chestnutherbs.com/best-wild-foods-for-beginning-foragers/) to get the inside scoop. On the other hand, there are a number of native plants that should not be gathered from wild places. Please see the United Plant Savers' [Species At Risk list](https://unitedplantsavers.org/species-at-risk-list/) before you begin foraging. And read up on our [Sustainable and Safe Gathering Practices](https://chestnutherbs.com/foraging-for-wild-edibles-and-herbs-sustainable-and-safe-gathering-practices/) while you're at it. - Is foraging safe? If you know what you're doing and approach new plants with respect and caution, foraging can be very safe and satisfying! That being said, there are deadly poisonous plants out there that have edible and medicinal look-alikes. Be 150% sure of your identification before gathering a plant. Don't take someone else's word for it. If in doubt, DO NOT harvest! Find a reliable field guide and double check yourself. Learn about the poisonous plants in your area. For more guidance, see our article on [Safe Gathering Practices](https://chestnutherbs.com/foraging-for-wild-edibles-and-herbs-sustainable-and-safe-gathering-practices/). - Can I forage in urban areas? Absolutely! Cities are fertile ground for foraging, as long as you follow some basic guidelines: Harvest in clean locations. Avoid harvesting near roads, foundations of buildings, electric lines, railroads, floodplains of polluted rivers, and fields or parks that may be sprayed with herbicide. If you have trouble finding clean places to gather, ask around at community garden plots. They might let you dig or pick wild and weedy interlopers. - What are the best foraging books?
