The paper introduces STOMAPET (patent pending A2016/00888/23.11.2016) based on Eupatorium cannabinum (hemp-agrimony) and Inula helenium (elecampagne) and its potential application in diseases of the oral system. Methods: STOMAPET was prepared according to the patent application and HPLC analysis was performed for chemical analysis. In vitro studies were performed using human monocytes and the cells' viability was determined by MTS assay. In vivo studies involved lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine endotoxemia and veterinary clinical case reports. Results: HPLC analysis revealed various phenolic compounds and alantolactone. In in vitro studies, monocytes viability remained stable, around and above 100% at all concentrations (7.8 to 250 \u00b5g/mL), and a high stimulatory effect on cell proliferation was noted. In LPS-induced murine endotoxemia, STOMAPET prevents mortality, improves the decrease in body mass, and prevents the drop in temperature. Case reports of companion animals with oral diseases ameliorated after STOMAPET treatment are presented. Conclusions: Preclinical studies confirmed the safety of STOMAPET and its pharmacological potential. The results of the veterinary case reports are also encouraging. More studies are needed to find the precise mechanism of action in correlation to chemical composition.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-09-16", "cleaned_text": "Biomedical Application of a Herbal Product Based on Two Asteraceae Species [https://doi.org/10.3390/app10186444](https://doi.org/10.3390/app10186444) [Application of Plant Natural Compounds]( /journal/applsci/special_issues/plant_natural_compounds_application )) Abstract: Featured Application Abstract 1. Introduction [1](#B1-applsci-10-06444)]. Inflammation, probably the most vital immune response induced by noxious stimuli or conditions, is an essential component of innate immunity as first line of defense against pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi [ [2](#B2-applsci-10-06444)]. [3](#B3-applsci-10-06444)]. Extracts of several species are potent antiinflammatory aqueous extract fraction of E. lindleyanum [ E. [8](#B8-applsci-10-06444)], etc. Flavonoids and terpenes have been identified as the two main chemical constituents of Eupatorium [ [9](#B9-applsci-10-06444)]. It was shown both in in vitro [ [8](#B8-applsci-10-06444), [10](#B10-applsci-10-06444)] and in vivo assays [ [6](#B6-applsci-10-06444)] that the antiinflammatory activity of Eupatorium main compounds is exerted on the gene and protein level by down-regulation [11](#B11-applsci-10-06444)], I. [ I. [ [13](#B13-applsci-10-06444)], etc. Sesquiterpene lactones, mainly alantolactone and isoalantolactone, are considered as its active ingredients [ [14](#B14-applsci-10-06444)]. In experimental models of inflammation, these compounds supress nitric oxide production and other proinflammatory cytokines via the downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and TNF receptor factor 6 inflammatory [20](#B20-applsci-10-06444)], membranes, and induce an antiproliferative effect [ [21](#B21-applsci-10-06444)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Method of Preparation (According to Patent Application No. A2016/00888/23.11.2016) 2.2. HPLC Analysis [22](#B22-applsci-10-06444)]. Separation of sesquiterpene lactones was done on the above mentioned column in the isocratic mode, using 60% methanol at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, with an injection volume of 10 L [ [23](#B23-applsci-10-06444)]. 2.3.

Suppressing this response by various agents could counteract the endotoxic sepsis and organ dysfunction, increasing survival. In Group 1, following LPS injection, 1 mouse died after 24 h, 3 mice after 45 h, and 1 mouse after 47 h. Group 2 mice injected with LPS and treated with STOMAPET survived. [Figure 6](#applsci-10-06444-f006)describes the survival rate of mice as a function of time since LPS injection (in hours) for Group 1 (black line) and Group 2 (red line). [Figure 2](#applsci-10-06444-f002)shows the body mass dependence (g) as mean \u00b1 SEM of the masses of the 5 mice as a function of the time (hours) elapsed since the LPS injection. In Group 1 (black line) there was a significant decrease in body weight (p = 0.0130 < 0.05) at 24 h after LPS injection compared with mass at the time of LPS injection (0 h). In Group 1, at 48 h, no mice survived (see [Figure 1](#applsci-10-06444-f001)). In Group 2 (red line), there was a significant decrease in body weight at 48 h (p = 0.0113 < 0.05) and 72 h (p = 0.0044 < 0.05) from the time of LPS injection (0 h). However, at 24 h (p = 0.0577), 144 h (p = 0.2394), and 168 h (p = 0.0754), the decreases are insignificant compared to the time of LPS injection (hours) showing that STOMAPET improves in time the decrease in body mass caused LPS-induced endotoxemia years old - Diagnosis: Hodgkin's lymphoma, from the age of 4; treated symptomatically and kept alive by the attending physician through the devotion of the owner. - In this dog, a year ago, a stomatitis overlapped with an unbearable halena. The attending physician proposed euthanizing him, but the owner did not want to and isolated him in a room. After symptomatic treatments (antibiotics in general, after antibiogram and general supportive treatments), the treatment with STOMAPET was started, at 1 drop/kg of 2\u00d7/day for 3 months. - After this period, the pain disappeared, the animal consuming the food well, the green-yellow secretions that were present 3 months ago also disappeared and no remnants of mucosa appeared. After the period of 3 months, the treatment was continued (application of drops in the oral cavity only once/day in a dose of 1 drop/kg/day). Currently, after 1 year, the dog is alive and stable. - 7-year-old male half-breed cat - Diagnosis: Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) - Treatment: insulin 3 IU/2 times/day and symptomatic treatment - The cat underwent diabetes tests, but had a gingival infection and a devitalized canine broke. 3 days of treatment with antibiotic followed, descaling was used, but the canine root could not be extracted, the area remaining open and very painful. Then the oral treatment was applied with STOMAPET 1 drop/kg/day for 30 days, without any other local treatment; after this period, the cat only had a gingival infection and the place where the canine root was observed was completely healed. Currently, the patient's evolution is good, following the treatment and monitoring for diabetes. - 12-year-old Yorkshire dog - Diagnosis: Ascites, gingivitis, and dental tartar - Treatment of hepatoprotective ascites and abdominal transudate evacuation puncture. - Before descaling for 5 days, the dog was treated with an antibiotic. After anesthesia followed by descaling, STOMAPET was applied in the oral cavity, in a dose of 1 drop/kg/day for 30 days. Very strangely, after this 30-day treatment, the dog only had no ascites (no more fluid accumulated in the abdomen) and the oral infection disappeared completely, with no recurrences. 4. Discussions 4.1. HPLC Analysis [26](#B26-applsci-10-06444)]. [27](#B27-applsci-10-06444)]. Previous studies showed that E. cannabinum contains mainly quercetin and kaempferol glycosides with rutin as a dominating compound [ [28](#B28-applsci-10-06444)]. Additionally, phenolic and organic acids are primary anti-inflammatory ingredients of TMX, a traditional Chinese Medicine based on dried roots of Inula helenium L. and Inula racemosa Hook [ [29](#B29-applsci-10-06444)]. 4.2. In Vitro Studies [30](#B30-applsci-10-06444)] and other specific compounds of Inula\u2014isoalantolactones and seco-eudesmanolides significantly suppressed LPS-induced NF-B activation, as well phosphoinositide kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation [ [31](#B31-applsci-10-06444)]. Moreover, several extracts of E. perfoliatum showed anti-inflammatory activity against LPS-stimulated macrophages by inhibition release, chemokines with eupafolin and a dimeric guaianolide having prominent NO inhibiting activity [ [8](#B8-applsci-10-06444)]. 4.3. In Vivo Studies 4.3.1. Preclinical Studies [32](#B32-applsci-10-06444)]. Moreover, in another murine model of peritonitis, eupatoriopicrin, a compound found in Eupatorium species, efficiently suppressed phosphorylation of p38 oil reduces the scores for plaque-bacteria, calculus, gingivitis, and the inflammatory infiltrate [ [37](#B37-applsci-10-06444)]. 5.
