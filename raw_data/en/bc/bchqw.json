LaVange, PhD Office of Biostatistics FDA/CDER/OTS 3 Outline Overview of CTTI Statistics Think Tank One- versus two -study paradigm Non-inferiority trials and alternative approaches Data from multiple infection (body) sites Prior therapy Data availability and new data collection 4 CTTI Statistics Think Tank Clinical Trials Transformational Initiative (CTTI) convened the Statistics Think Tank for Anti -Bacterial Drug Development on August 20, 2012 in Bethesda Meeting objective: To discuss innovative approaches to the design and analysis of clinical trials in anti -bacterial drug development. Discussion to focus on non -inferiority trials and include Bayesian approaches that can incorporate both historical data on active control products and mechanistic data arising from PK/PD and other pre -clinical studies 5 CTTI Statistics Think Tank Participants -Four biostatistics faculty members -Four statisticians from industry -Four government statisticians (external to CDER) -CDER statistical review team for anti -infectives Areas of expertise included -Clinical trials methodology -Bayesian methodology -Non-inferiority trial designs -Other (meta -analyses, missing data, hierarchical modeling) 6 CTTI Statistics Think Tank Just one of a number of initiatives FDA is undertaking to promote anti -bacterial drug development Provided an opportunity for leading experts in clinical trial methodologies to discuss alternative approaches to design and analysis that may prove useful for anti -bacterial programs Ultimate goal is to increase the likelihood that clinical trials of promising agents are successful and to ensure that those agents, if approved, are in fact safe and effective therapies for the intended patient populations 7 CTTI Discussion Topics FDA statistics review team identified four broad areas to focus the discussion 1. One- versus two -study paradigm: When does it make sense to plan for a single, confirmatory study as sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety in treating antibacterial infections, what particular requirements should be placed on such a study, and what types of supporting evidence should be required? 2. Non -inferiority trials: Are there more efficient ways to establish non-inferiority to an existing therapy, when placebo controlled studies are not ethical/possible, given the many challenges in this disease area? 8 CTTI Discussion Topics Discussion areas, cont. 3. Multiple (body) sites of infection: Are there efficient ways to combine information across multiple (body) sites for a single pathogen, or across multiple pathogens for a single (body) site to better inform confirmatory trial designs and analysis? 4. Trial logistics: Are there innovative ways to approach a variety of other problems with anti -bacterial trials, e.g., accounting for prior therapies that cannot be withheld? ONE STUDY PARADIGM Discussion Area #1 9 10 One-Study Paradigm Design issues -Size of study, power, and representation of subgroups -Representativeness of study population - more sites with fewer patients per site more attractive, given the non - sampling environment of clinical trials Analysis and results: -Level of evidence Move beyond p -values and consider totality of evidence in the form of the posterior distribution of the treatment effect -Consistency across subgroups 11 One-Study Paradigm Replication -Quality is critical in non -inferiority (NI) trials; poor trial conduct can cause bias towards the alternative -Two successful studies designed and conducted by two groups of investigators with similar results adds confidence in this setting -Independence (and, therefore, replication) may be questioned, if the margin is derived from the same historical data -May not be ethical to conduct a 2nd trial, once results of the first are available 12 One-Study Paradigm Single study with p -value < 0.05 -Chance of replication is 50:50 supportive evidence needed Medical device analogue: Mechanism of action plus one confirmatory trial sufficient for submission Pharmacologic or pre -clinical data -In vitro 'kill' studies -Exposure response data from animal models Exposure response in humans from phase 2 studies Differentiate between NMEs and drugs approved for other indications NON -INFERIORITY TRIALS Discussion Area #2 13 14 Non-Inferiority Trials Ideally, have probability distribution for placebo, control, and test drug and compare the three; degree of overlap may be informative In addition to comparing against NI margin, point estimate and level of precision (width of confidence interval) are important 3-arm trial: test treatment vs. active control vs. placebo -Rescue offered for placebo patients (quickly) 15 Non-Inferiority Endpoints If mortality is a component of the clinical endpoint, and we know the treatment difference (M1) for mortality, can we say the difference for the clinical endpoint is at least as large? -E.g., 10% margin for mortality; 12.5% margin for response? Ordinal outcome: Mortality vs Clinical Failure vs Clinical Success -Proportional odds regression for analysis -Treatment effects in terms of odds ratios may not be ideal Are there studies that have data on both mortality and clinical cure that can be used as a bridge? Note: Motivated by lack of data to compute margin, not sample size 16 Bayesian Approach Bayesian approach for determining NI margins -Dirichlet process with meta -analysis (Tiwari, et al. 2012) Bayesian model for NI analysis -Historical data for prior on active control (Gamalo, et al., 2011) -Non -informative prior for test drug -Potential issue with bias/confounding -Suggestion to assume a prior on the difference between test drug and control (from early phase studies) Bayesian Approach to NI Margins HABP/VABP example: -Estimate the drug effect relative to placebo using historical data on active control and inadequate or delayed therapy. -Margin computation from Sorbello, et al., 2010 HABP/VABP Data All-cause mortality for inadequate or delayed therapy: = 32% Hypothetical Bayesian Analysis Study 001 Study 002 Experimental Active Control Experimental Active Control All-Cause Mortality all mortality rate of 20%. 21 Bayesian Approach Evaluate Bayesian approach in parallel to frequentist approach and compare operating characteristics -Bayesian approaches also useful as sensitivity analyses, when frequentist approach is primary For any trial, the gain in evidence in favor of test drug depends on the strength of the prior evidence 22 Bayesian alpha: Probability of a true negative treatment effect when the study shows a positive effect Prior Odds of Success# Power = 80% 85% 90% 1.0 on prior information, e.g., phase 2 trials Assume (frequentist) = 0.025 (1 -sided) * = Pr (H0| Reject H0) = /(+power*OS) 23 Bayesian Approach For a single confirmatory trial with (frequentist) = 0.025 (1 -sided): -Bayesian approach will result in an increased sample size requirement, unless credible prior evidence in favor of treatment exists -Strength of this prior evidence needs to be considered in addition to the strength of evidence from the single confirmatory trial 24 Bayesian Approach Advantages and disadvantages -Allows modeling uncertainty -May not provide efficiency \u2014could know less than we think! -If historical data is not applicable to the current study, weakly informative priors can be used -Caution about strong assumption for exchangeability -- Patients will probably not be exchangeable across studies, but could be within a study -Study exchangeability assumption leads to hierarchical modeling 25 MIC-Based Approach Approach discussed by Dean Follmann based on recent work with Erica Brittain and John Powers. Related to methods of Paul Ambrose and co -authors, but attempts to: 1. Use MIC data for superiority testing 2. Ensure randomization protects against confounding MIC-Based Approach A B A B A B A B Low MIC -A Low MIC -B Low MIC -A High MIC -B High MIC -A Low MIC -B** High MIC -A High MIC -B ** Drug B should be superior to Drug A for these patients MIC-Based Approach A B A B A B MIC Drug A Low MIC Drug A High MIC Drug A A B MIC Drug B High MIC Drug B Low MIC Drug B Drug B 70% Drug A 90% Drug B 90% Drug B 90% Drug A 90% Drug B 70% Drug A 70% Drug A 70% Drug B beats Drug A! 28 MIC-Based Logistic Regression Logistic model regressing clinical outcome on: -Randomized treatment -Baseline MICs under both treatment and control -Treatment x MIC interactions Uses the model to test if treatment is superior to active control for discordant subjects whose pathogens have: -Low MICs under treatment -High MICs under control Another MIC -Based Approach AUC/MIC is basically the operating dose in the blood in a patient normalized by baseline MIC -AUC = dose/clearance -The greater the AUC/MIC ratio for a patient, the greater the likelihood of successful outcome for that patient Idea: Conduct a randomized trial as follows: -Control arm -- give the fixed dose as indicated -Test arm -- collect PK blood levels during 2 -3 days of the start of the treatment and find the ratio AUC/MIC value for that patient -Adjust the dose of that patient for the rest of the treatment period, so that the ratio remains in a band of suitably high values Compare the two randomized groups (1) for non -inferiority, and if successful (2) for superiority Advantage: the treated group is likely to be at least numerically superior to control MULTIPLE INFECTION SITES Discussion Area #3 30 31 Multiple Infection Sites Scenario: data are available for the same pathogen studied in several infection (body) sites, e.g., urinary tract infection, skin infection, pulmonary infection -Data may arise from separate studies or a single study stratified by infection site General agreement that simple pooling of data across sites is not appropriate Model -based approach preferred, e.g., hierarchical model with random effects for each infection site 32 Multiple Infection Sites Enroll patients with related infection types in a single trial, using stratified randomization Hypothetical example: Mortality endpoint; resistant pathogens; superiority trial Infection types Standard of Care Test Drug Difference (95% CI) Blood stream 33 Multiple Infection Sites Comment: One can pool results across body sites for a broader indication -If clinically meaningful to pool, considering disease severity and dose -Infection types are path -physiologically similar -If there is some evidence of consistency of results and replication across body sites -Multiplicity issues arise if claim is sought for only those indications showing positive results 34 Multiple Infection Sites In the hypothetical example -Results are okay for the bloodstream, e.g., p -value = 0.003 (1-sided) in favor of test drug -Concern: intra -abdominal infection result (p -value = 0.061, 1-sided) and HAP (wrong direction) are inconsistent with bloodstream result 35 Multiple Infection Sites Similar to the subgroup problem, e.g., treatment heterogeneity across regions in a multi -regional trial Bayesian approach: Assume subgroups are exchangeable in the hierarchical model; can use covariates to help Weigh evidence from studies of other treatments that may show similar inconsistencies across infection sites PRIOR THERAPY Discussion Area #4: Trial Logistics 36 PRIOR THERAPY Discussion Area #4: Trial Logistics 37 38 Prior Therapy Proposal to limit number of patients allowed on prior therapy, and stratify analysis -Could impose a tighter margin on the prior therapy stratum -Require trend towards superiority in the no prior therapy stratum (point estimate in the right direction) Should also confirm whether patient characteristics pre-dispose those receiving prior therapy to achieve success 39 Prior Therapy If enrollment and randomization procedures could be streamlined, need for prior therapy may be diminished Consider establishing a clinical trial network for this purpose, e.g., NETT Advantages: -Infrastructure in place for central randomization (e.g., via web portal), EDC, etc. -Clinic personnel trained and experienced in anti -bacterial trials -Some processes could benefit from commonality across protocols, e.g., informed consent process 40 Prior Therapy Could also consider cluster randomization or community trials -Clinics are randomized, rather than patients -If all patients in a clinic are randomized to Drug A, it may be possible to accelerate initiation of treatment and avoid need for prior therapy -Ideally have a large number of clinics and a small number of patients per clinic -Statistical analysis takes into account the impact of clustering; degrees of freedom = # clusters and not # patients Trade -off in sample size gain due to reducing prior therapy versus loss due to clustering 41 Data Clintrials.gov: Anti -bacterial studies are under - represented, given mortality risk of infections Need to encourage data sharing from studies being run -Proposal for CTTI to bring researchers together to share data 42 Data New data collection -To aid in non -inferiority margin determination -As a source for prior information to support single study submissions or Bayesian approaches Options -Chart data could be collected from clinics in network to provide historical perspective on practices, patients, etc. (PhRMA proposal) -Case control studies to estimate treatment effects Propensity score matching -Retrospective cohort studies 43 Summary Emphasis on evidence Try for superiority; could be embedded in an NI trial Bayesian approaches worth considering; caution about exchangeability assumptions Cross -infection problem is tricky; need models to interpret variability across sites Office of Biostatistics working group to further explore ideas generated from the CTTI meeting BACK -UP SLIDES 44 45 Bayesian Approach Bayesian alpha calculations using frequentist specs: * = Pr (H0| Reject H0) = A/B (from Bayes' formula), where A = Pr (H0) x Pr (Reject H0| H0) B = A + Pr (Ha ) x Pr (Ha| Ha) The above equation is basically * = / ( + power x OS) where OS = prior odds of success = Pr (Ha ) / Pr (H0) = frequentist alpha Brookings Council on Antibacterial Drug Development Meeting #1 The Brookings Institution August 30, 2012 Enrolment Logistics for CABP BCADD Aug 30, 2012 David Friedland, MD Vice President, Clinical Sciences Cerexa, Inc.

Preference for PRO use for primary outcome -Potentially could add time to enrolment procedures Prior antibiotics -Daptomycin data suggests prior antibiotics had a masking effect -Ceftaroline data suggested similar outcomes; however, on closer inspection, these data actually conflict with daptomycin data Subjects with prior antibiotics randomized to ceftaroline had lower response rates than those with no prior antibiotics No trends using early endpoint where prior antibiotics should have had a more significant effect Additional Points Regulators and clinicians want sicker patients in trials -Minimum PORT III but majority IV or V -Longer to assess and more likely to have prior antibiotics As was seen with ceftaroline Phase 3 trials Diagnostic tests may help identify the \"correct\" patients -Usually do not help with culture results; therefore, no MIC data to help with breakpoints Lack of US subjects in Phase 3 trials -Even though minority of subjects receive prior antibiotics, US sites do not want to participate if no prior antibiotics allowed Clinical Trial Networks could be a solution -What about competition if 2 or more Sponsors doing same type of trial? Brookings Council on Antibacterial Drug Development Dr. Daniel Benjamin Professor of Pediatrics and Faculty Associate Director, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine Two Drug Development Paradoxes 1) For most products, the question is, do they work? And the difference between molecule and placebo can be quite small. In order to power trials and achieve licensure, the incentive is for companies to design large well-powered efficacy trials that expose many patients to product. Antimicrobial drug development paradox: by the time products get to Phase II testing, they probably 'work' (kill the bug on the plate), and the key question is, do they hurt the patient? Adverse events are rarely detected in the setting of small sample size. There is therefore a much greater incentive to design small trials that show efficacy, but don 't reveal safety 2) Skin and soft tissue infections are not a public health crisis, but organisms completely resistant to current antibiotics is. Challenge is improving safety in the setting of small benefits for many patients in the present, small numbers of patients in the present, and potentially large numbers of patients in the future Lower the bar for efficacy, raise the bar for safety Ease regulatory burden pre -approval: e.g., the fraction of enrollees with prior therapy, sample size, etc. Limited indication and/or safety statement (e.g., the safety of this molecule is not well described relative to other therapeutic options for this indication) Indication broadened and/or safety statement removed based upon the successful completion of FDA -guided trials designed and powered for safety Thus, several hundred fewer patients are tested for efficacy in the current design (no prior antibiotic therapy, etc.) prior to approval in exchange for several thousand more evaluated for safety post - approval 'FDA -guided' analogous to written request approval for pediatric exclusivity Brookings Council on Antibacterial Drug Development Meeting #1 The Brookings Institution August 30, 2012 FDA CDER's Benefit -Risk Framework Theresa M.

Generally... -Trials enrolled patients with infections at any of variety of tissue sites in a trial often with an active comparator -Goal of showing comparable point estimates for clinical cure -Indications were based on the subsets of tissue sites from within the trials -In vitro data (e.g., serum from patients receiving the test drug) also evaluated -Indications were less specific than current day (e.g., respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection) 67 Background - 2 1990's move towards more site specific trials -Natural history of the disease may differ -Endpoints & Treatment duration may differ 1992 IDSA Guidelines 1992 FDA Points to Consider document - Clinical Development and Labeling of Anti -Infective Drug Products* 1998 FDA Guidance documents** Present - Updating Guidance documents -10 indication -specific plus others updated so far** * http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070975.pdf ** http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm064980.htm 68 1992 IDSA/FDA Guidelines There was a clear need to improve the design and conduct of clinical trials of anti -infective drugs; more specifically, it seemed essential to (1) provide clearer definition of disease states and their clinical and microbiological endpoints; (2) take into account changes in the diagnosis and management of specific infectious diseases; ... 69 Background - 3 2000 Greater emphasis on the evidence base for non - inferiority trials -Public concern about the scientific validity of antibacterial drug trials This has generally led to larger trials Continued trend towards more specific Indications Respiratory tract infection (RTI) Lower RTI + Upper RTI (ABS and ABOM) CABP + ABECB +/ - Nosocomial pneumonia HABP + VABP 70 Drug Development - 1 Decline in activity in the development of new antibacterial drugs Mature field w/ approx. 50 to 60 different active ingredients -Some no longer marketed -Some had postmarket safety problems -Some may not have had characteristics that would lead to their continued availability -Resistance has impacted upon utility of some 71 Drug Development - 2 Is the current level and are the types of antibacterial drugs that are being developed meeting patient and public health needs? -Currently we are seeing areas of unmet need -Resistance continues to erode our therapeutic armamentarium -Importance of Development of new safe & effective antibacterial drugs Antimicrobial stewardship - prudent use Infection control 72 Drug Development - 3 Advances in clinical trials intended to improve the science of clinical trials -Comments on lack of feasibility -Economic issues in antibacterial drug development Pipeline of new antibacterial drugs not robust and focused on a limited disease spectrum -Some for skin infections, little for CIAI, CUTI, very little for CABP & HABP / VABP Some antibacterial drug development in important bacterial diseases reportedly going ex - U.S. 73 Addressing Patient and Public Health Needs How do we address patient and public health needs for antibacterial drug to treat patients' infections? What are some of the choices and/or trade -offs? How should these be addressed? 74 Goals - Theory and Practice Most would want -A robust pipeline of new antibacterial drugs - especially drugs with new mechanisms of action -Precise characterization of safety and efficacy -Agents already available that are active against new resistance mechanisms that will emerge in the future -Little uncertainty All of these goals may not be achievable -economic, scientific, regulatory issues/challenges Development of a new drug can take 5 -10 years -Difficult to react in a timely fashion -Some development programs not successful -Ideally have options to choose from in advance of the need 75 Questions on the Issues and Challenges we Currently Face Are there ways that we can do a better, more efficient job with clinical trials? If a greater tolerance for risk and uncertainty is appropriate, in what areas? -areas of unmet need? -indications where development is sparse? -other indications? Why might one consider a greater tolerance for risk and uncertainty? -Unmet need? Lack of satisfactory options? Feasibility? Characteristics of the product? If accepting greater uncertainty is appropriate, we may learn important information about a product in the postmarketing setting (e.g., new safety findings, settings where efficacy may be relatively less than other products); will that be acceptable? 76 A Somewhat Paradoxical Situation Achieving precise characterization of efficacy and safety for traditional antibacterial drug development may lead to less antibacterial drug development and generate unmet need Once there is unmet need, greater risk and uncertainty may be accepted for the unmet need population It is somewhat paradoxical that the avoidance of uncertainty for traditional development programs is generating the situation that leads one to be willing to accept uncertainty for the unmet need scenario 77 A Somewhat Paradoxical Situation Generating unmet need also means that there is a period of time when we lack satisfactory treatment options for patients Addressing unmet need, while a critical thing to do once it has developed, is a situation of trying to catch up with what has already happened (resistance) Ideally new agents would already be available and we could avoid the unmet need scenario 78 Theoretical Scenarios on Drug Development - Precision and Uncertainty High levels of precision (lower uncertainty) may lead to few new antibacterial drugs developed for a limited range of indications that are very well characterized -unmet need may persist Lower levels of precision (higher uncertainty) may lead to more antibacterial drugs developed for more indications, but they will be less well characterized - -could possibly avoid an unmet need scenario(s) There are many points in between these two poles and what is appropriate likely varies by indication Some of the new drugs that are developed may add significantly to the therapeutic armamentarium, others may not add much Important to articulate judgments and trade -offs in an open and transparent manner 79 Point for Discussion We welcome a discussion on the issue of appropriate balance of risks, benefits, and uncertainty in order to best meet patient and public health needs. 80 Thank you John F.
