Sue MacLeman CEO MTPConnect ii Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaExecutive Summary iiiThe Australian medical technologies and pharmaceutical (MTP) sector must endeavour to become more competitive, pushing forward the development of high value and digitally enabled MTP solutions based on global market needs and trends. To realise growth, the Australian sector needs to focus on increasing its capacity and ability to translate basic research into commercially viable solutions for global markets, developing improved access to global value chains (GVCs) (Figure 1).Executive Summary Vision Over the next 20 years, Australia's medical technologies and pharmaceutical sector must capitalise on existing strengths to define a stronger global position, which will enhance the ability of the sector to translate basic research, and lead to an increased volume and value of IP, products and services for international markets. FIGURE 1: MTP VALUE CHAIN AND ASSOCIATED 20 YEAR VISION CHARACTERISTICS Focused research to support growth opportunitiesIncreased activity with more global and local companies completing clinical development and translationIncreased export of highvalue MTP solutionsImproved access to GVCs and increased economic contribution20 year Australian MTP sector vision Basic researchPreclinical developmentClinical developmentManufacturing Market access, marketing and salesA supportive and efficient business environment is fundamental to increasing the competitiveness of the sector, promoting the success of start ups and SMEs, and attracting and retaining companies of all sizes to complete on shore development and manufacturing of high value MTP solutions. Core to this is enhanced regulatory efficiency and a national approach to data and informatics. Under this vision, four growth opportunities and the relevant actions to enable their success have been identified. iv Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaFIGURE 2: GLOBAL MTP MEGATRENDSThe global MTP sector is driven by various trends, ultimately underpinned by a universal desire for better health and wellbeing. The megatrends illustrated in Figure 2 represent seven significant trends in the global sector which are already disrupting commercial, societal and cultural approaches to the development of MTP solutions. Consideration of these trends is critical in order for stakeholders in the ecosystem to make strategic decisions that will successfully position the Australian sector for future success. 3. GLOBAL BIOSECURITY Recent pandemics highlight the globally transmissible nature of disease. When combined with increased treatment resistance this creates unpredictable threats that will require rapid technology responses. 4. CONSUMER CONTROL Future patients will be educated and informed decision makers, with more information available to them than ever before. Technology and information access are empowering patients to become more proactive in managing their healthcare. 5. DIGITAL EVOLUTION With the massive amounts of data generated daily in the healthcare system, there will be significant shifts in how data is exchanged, processed and used. 6. DEVELOPING MARKETS A rising middle class together with rapid growth in developing countries is creating increased demand for MTP solutions. 7. INTEGRATED CARE Countries are shifting from highly fragmented healthcare systems to those based on endto end integration, driven by the need to meet the changing demands of patients and to improve efficiency. CHRONIC BURDEN PRECISION HEALTHCARE GLOBAL BIOSECURITY CONSUMER CONTROLDIGITAL EVOLUTION DEVELOPING MARKETSINTEGRATED CARE 1. CHRONIC BURDEN Modern MTP solutions allow patients to manage chronic disease and live longer than ever before, however, this comes at considerable cost to public health systems. 2. PRECISION HEALTHCARE Advances in science and technology are enabling MTP solutions that are tuned to the specific needs of individuals. Targeted pharmaceuticals and bespoke technologies will be delivered that provide improved outcomes for individual patients. A changing global landscape vThere are numerous opportunities that can be pursued by the Australian sector in a global market. To understand which opportunities can be captured locally, the Australian sector must consider its comparative advantages and disadvantages. Advantages need to be leveraged, while disadvantages must be alleviated by specific actions from the ecosystem to provide a more sustainable base from which to build Australian growth.Australia's competitive landscape FIGURE 3: AUSTRALIA'S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES RELATED TO THE MTP SECTOR ADVANTAGES Strong international reputation for quality Diverse culture, social economic stability and unique location An equitable healthcare system A strong research community Highly skilled and educated workforce Reputable national regulatory authority Quality clinical trials Strong IP protection Quality infrastructure and business environmentRELATED DISADVANTAGES Small market and population Complex federated model Low global competitiveness Complex federated model Disperse rural and remote populations Low rates of collaboration and translation of research Loss of key talent Changing skills requirements Specialist skills shortages Lack of sector specific management skills Fewer researchers in businesses Lagging STEMM skills pipeline Regulatory inefficiency Slow start up times for multi site trials Federated model Patents granted too readily Lagging digital infrastructure Funding gaps Complex federated model Comparatively high corporate tax rate Advantages can be lost if not continually invested in Disadvantages can become advantages by being prioritised and addressed vi Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaAccelerated pharmaceutical development VISION: To cultivate a high q uality and efficient early s tage development environment for pharmaceutical products. This opportunity would result in an increasing number of businesses completing pharmaceutical development in Australia, improving activity in the high v alue service sector and an increase in the rate of local research being pulled through to a higher value inflection point and ultimately exported to the global market in the form of IP. KEY OUTCOMES: Improved reputation and benchmarks for Australian trials, increase in value and production of Australia's precl inical and clinical trials industry; increase in clinical products developed and commercialised in Australia. Diagnostic and informatics products and services VISION: To develop a world l eading sector based on the development and integration of medical diagnostic and informatics platforms. Data security and interoperability is at the fore of this opportunity, and will underlie increased access to de i dentified patient and population data. Information packages resulting from this data can be leveraged by local and international businesses for the development of diagnostic products, and preventative and precision MTP solutions. KEY OUTCOMES: Robust prophylactic services ecosystem for patients receiving genome sequencing and analysis on predispositions; artificial intelligence enabled clinical decision support; population health analytics.Smart devices, implants and bionics VISION: To significantly increase the number of MTP businesses designing, testing and manufacturing communicative and responsive devices, bionics and implants for global export. This opportunity would see improvements regarding the approach of the Australian regulatory system to personalised devices, and greater levels of digital integration between individuals, clinicians, researchers and developers, resulting in the development of expert systems. KEY OUTPUTS: Examples include anatomically correct 3D printed implants; ingestible smart monitoring devices; integrated bionic limbs that are controlled by neural pathways; expert systems using data from biosensors.Manufacturing high-value pharmaceuticals VISION: To focus Australian manufacturing efforts toward high v alue and niche pharmaceutical products that create sustainable export revenue. Australia can leverage advantages around ingenuity, quality and reliability to attract businesses without the capacity to develop complex production processes in h ouse. This would see an increase in the number of local development teams required to manufacture products for direct export or clinical development. KEY OUTCOMES: Development of novel drug delivery and manufacturing technologies; Australian based contract manufacturing and development of biologics, biosimilars and other complex products for global multinationals, with a focus on distribution into Asia.Based on the global megatrends and Australia's competitive position, four growth opportunities have been identified. Each opportunity leverages existing research strengths, but requires considerable business and ecosystem actions to overcome challenges, as well as focused science and technology investment.Opportunities for growth viiForesight of the various technology innovations that will enable these opportunities over the next 20 years is impossible. However, by examining emerging technologies and the key technical challenges faced today, research priorities can be extrapolated to help provide a guide for MTP businesses on where to invest effort on research TABLE 1: ENABLING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY - FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES SUMMARY Smart devices, implants and bionicsAccelerated pharmaceutical developmentManufacturing highvalue pharmaceuticalsDiagnostics and materials Bionics and biosensors Bespoke and smart implants Data capture, analysis and communications Information and communications technologies Regulatory science Focused basic research Instrumentation and infrastructure Manufacturing and platform technologies Data analysis and digital integration Instrumentation and tools Focused clinical researchand development - either directly or by collaborating with publically funded research agencies or universities. The list below provides an overview of some of the enabling science and technology required to make these opportunities a reality. Enabling Science and Technology viii Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaWhile the growth opportunities indicate a bright future, the sector must act quickly or risk losing its place in a competitive global market. Businesses cannot achieve this in isolation, with action requiring an integrated approach across the entire ecosystem.

Growth in the Australian sector will have economic benefits by creating new jobs and revenue, and societal benefits from improving the wellbeing of citizens. To improve the sector's competitiveness, it is critical that the right kind of environment is supported to allow for the translation of inventive ideas into innovative solutions; one that encourages strategic and cross disciplinary research, collaborative business partnerships, efficient development timeframes, agile and reputable regulatory frameworks, and appropriate investment incentives. While collaboration and cross disciplinary research is applicable to many sectors, it is critical in the development of novel MTP solutions, as these are often underpinned by the convergence of disparate fields of science and technology. While Australia holds a strong reputation regarding the discovery research that feeds the MTP sector due to high levels of public investment and existing incentives that encourage business spending, there are sub optimal rates of translation of this research into commercial success. Failure to alter this and foster an environment that allows Australian research to be commercially developed will likely result in the Australian MTP sector reducing in global significance, leading to lost economic value and potential social impacts concerning availability to new MTP solutions. This Roadmap has been developed by CSIRO through direct industry consultation. The Roadmap aims to complement the work of MTPConnect, the MedTech and Pharmaceutical Industry Growth Centre. MTPConnect have recently released the Medical technology, Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical 10-year Sector Competitiveness Plan (SCP), 1 which addresses growth priorities required to improve the sector's competitiveness and productivity. This Roadmap seeks to complement the SCP by assessing longer term opportunities for growth, drawing upon the SCP to define enabling actions that will position the sector for sustainable and achievable growth. 1 L.E.K.

To realise growth, the Australian sector needs to focus on increasing its capacity and ability to translate basic research into commercially viable solutions for global markets (Figure 4). A supportive and efficient business environment is fundamental to increasing the competitiveness of the sector, promoting the success of start ups and small to medium enterprises (SMEs), and attracting and retaining companies of all sizes to complete on shore development and manufacturing of high value MTP solutions. Core to this is enhanced regulatory efficiency and a national approach to data and informatics. Under this vision, four growth opportunities and the relevant actions to enable their success have been identified.This vision can be considered discretely for each element of the MTP value chain: Basic research : maintain quality of research and focus efforts on subject areas that will enhance the competitiveness of each growth opportunity. Preclinical development : activity in pre clinical development must be increased, ensuring that more Australian ideas are effectively translated from the laboratory to the clinic. Clinical development : skills and infrastructure must be enhanced to provide the capacity for more clinical development on shore, increasing the value of MTP solutions in Australia. Manufacturing : efforts in manufacturing need to focus on an increased output of high value and niche products that leverage Australia's comparative advantages. Market access, marketing and sales : ease of access to global value chains (GVCs) is critical for the longevity of smaller MTP businesses in Australia, and will increase export revenue.1.1 A vision for Australia's medical technologies and pharmaceuticals sector FIGURE 4: MTP VALUE CHAIN AND ASSOCIATED 20 YEAR VISION CHARACTERISTICS 3The ultimate beneficiary of new MTP solutions is the patient, which is implicit to this Roadmap. However, in line with the objective of MTPConnect, the Roadmap is delivered through a lens which primarily considers the economic potential and competitive positioning of Australian MTP businesses. With that in mind, this Roadmap aims to support the development of Australia's MTP sector by identifying growth opportunities for the sector that are driven by current megatrends and that leverage the sector's comparative advantages. For each opportunity, the Roadmap provides key science and technology enablers, and identifies the business and ecosystem actions that need to be undertaken in order to realise the opportunity. The structure of the report is shown in Figure 5. Throughout this report there will be reference to the ecosystem that supports Australia's MTP businesses, which includes research institutes (covering everything from basic science to clinical research), industry organisations, funders and regulatory bodies (Figure 6). When effective, this ecosystem should provide Australian MTP businesses with a global competitive advantage. 1.2 This report FIGURE 5: STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT FIGURE 6: MTP VALUE CHAIN AND ECOSYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS *It is important to note that this value chain may vary depending on the MTP solution being produced; pharmaceutical products currently take over a decade to develop and follow numerous sub-stages, devices and wearables generally avoid the need for toxicology and dose studies and have a significantly shorter path to market, and digital solutions require limited clinical development and avoid classic MTP manufacturing entirely.Businesses (Start ups, SMEs, large medtech, biotech and pharmaceutical companies, including service providers)Basic researchPreclinical developmentClinical developmentManufacturing Market access, marketing and sales Research Institutes (Universities, CRCs, CSIRO, medical research institutes, etc.) Industry organisations Regulatory bodiesFunders6.

ENABLING SECTOR CHANGE Business actions Ecosystem actions 4 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaThe development of this Roadmap was industry led with input provided by various leaders from across Australia's medical technology and pharmaceutical SMEs, large companies, academia and industry associations. This report was developed alongside the MTPConnect SCP, and leveraged information collected from MTPConnect sector consultations. Directed consultation for this Roadmap took the form of structured interviews conducted by CSIRO consultants over two rounds. Early interviews focused on identifying key growth opportunities for the sector. The second cohort of interviews focused on refining the identified opportunities, as well as providing new perspectives. Contribution from 45 individuals representing 38 businesses, organisations and institutes including:1.3 Sector consultation Participants were asked to focus on opportunities that met the following criteria: Disruptive and transformative - significant shift from existing solutions that might require new business models, new healthcare models and societal/cultural adjustment. Adds significant value - creates a new industry, increases industry revenue, creates partnerships with the global community, enhances MTP sector competitiveness and sustainability. Included in sector scope - MTP solutions (intellectual property, platforms, diagnostics, products and/ or services) that might require regulation for their application, either now or in the future.

However, CSIRO also recognises that many technologies that are currently unregulated, specifically numerous digital MTP solutions, are fundamental to the future success of the sector and as such are considered to be in scope.2 Australia's competitive landscape 2.1 MTP in Australia Historically, Australia's geographic isolation from other developed countries has created a need for a local MTP sector. Beyond meeting national needs, it has delivered numerous innovative MTP solutions with international success (Figure 7 provides a non exhaustive snapshot). Currently, the MTP sector in Australia includes businesses of all sizes engaging in research, development, commercialisation, manufacturing and distribution of medical technologies, medical biotechnologies, and pharmaceuticals. The majority of businesses in the sector are SMEs, as highlighted by the medical technologies sub sector, where it is estimated that over 54% of businesses are start ups.4 4 Medical Technology Association of Australia Limited (2014).

However, Australia's competitive position can be rapidly altered as a result of government policies, global disruptions and other significant events. Advantages can be lost if not continually nurtured and invested in, while disadvantages can often be turned to advantages if properly understood and addressed. In order to strengthen Australia's competitive position globally, businesses, governments and research organisations need to focus on addressing those comparative disadvantages that can be influenced. Australia's comparative advantages and related comparative disadvantages are summarised in Figure 9. These advantages and disadvantages were identified through industry consultation and literature review, and are expanded upon in Appendix A.1. These advantages and disadvantages support the discussion of Australia's global positioning for each opportunity in Section 4. 2.2 Australian comparative advantages and disadvantages FIGURE 9: AUSTRALIA'S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES RELATED TO THE MTP SECTOR See Appendix A.1 for more information *There are a number of broad Australian comparative disadvantages such as high labour costs, a dispersed and geographically isolated market and small population which impact the MTP sector. These are unlikely to disappear in the next 20 years. 10 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaA changing global landscape 11FIGURE 10: THE GLOBAL MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND PHARMACEUTICALS SECTOR 8 8 Frost & Sullivan (2016). Vision 2025 Future of healthcare, Mountain View.Healthcare spending is rising globally, driven by an increased demand for MTP solutions as economies develop and seek a longer and higher quality of life. This spending curve has created an appetite for novel solutions that can help cut costs while delivering a higher standard of care. Much of the innovation in healthcare will stem from the MTP sector, with data driven insights providing platforms for novel and efficient MTP solutions, reducing the costs associated with their integration into the healthcare system.North America and Europe are currently the most significant global MTP markets. This is changing, with the emerging BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) markets rapidly increasing in buying power, and North America predicted to lose its 'largest healthcare market' tag to the Asia Pacific in the next decade. Australia represents a very small market, with approximately 1% of global pharmaceutical and medical technology sales, 7 however, it is well placed to capitalise on the rapid growth of its densely populated neighbours. 7 L.E.K.

This Roadmap identifies seven megatrends relevant to the global medical technologies and pharmaceuticals sector that will have significant impact on the development of MTP solutions over the next 20 years. A megatrend is defined as a substantial shift in social, economic, environmental, technological or geopolitical conditions that may reshape the way a sector operates in the long run.9 Megatrends occur at the intersection of many trends; they are not mutually exclusive and the trends that make up one megatrend can influence or contribute to another. 3.2.1 CHRONIC BURDEN Modern MTP solutions allow patients to manage chronic disease and live longer than ever before, however, this comes at considerable cost to the public health systems. By 2040, it is expected that the average age dependency ratio across the OECD will nearly double, meaning that economies may shift from a ratio of four working age people for every person aged over 65 years to roughly two working age people. 10 As the elderly use the healthcare more and have a lower financial contribution, changes will be essential to adapt health systems to longer lifespans, maximising health and wellbeing at all ages. 11 Along with an ageing population, the incidence of chronic disease is increasing globally, resulting in increased demand for healthcare. 12 The most common chronic disease groups include cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. Many factors are leading to the increasing incidence of chronic disease including increased life expectancy, changed diets, obesity rates and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. 13 9 Hajkowicz, S.

The Australian MTP sector needs to work with governments and healthcare providers to ensure research priorities and new technologies will provide improved nation wide healthcare outcomes at the same or reduced cost, turning care for chronic conditions into a long term growth and commercialisation opportunities.

Targeted pharmaceuticals and custom technologies will be delivered that provide improved outcomes for individual patients. The technology advances underpinning this include genomics, computational biology, medical imaging, biosensors and data mining. More recently in medical technology, 3D printing has accelerated interest in providing rapidly personalised medical technologies at a reduced cost. 15 16 Targeted pharmaceuticals and custom technologies will be delivered that provide improved outcomes for individual patients. Targeted therapies, together with genetic diagnostic tests will assist the selection of more precise treatments, avoiding costly trial anderror prescribing. 17 By leveraging molecular knowledge (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) it is possible to predict predisposition to disease, allowing early intervention on lifestyle choices, preventative actions, early diagnosis and monitoring of disease. 18 Future treatments will target the individual genes that cause disease. 19 Biosensors are a key technology that will enable customised health outcomes, providing clinicians and patients with personalised data. Point ofcare and home diagnostics are two key markets driving revenues and development in the biosensor market. In 2014, health and wellness monitoring applications accounted for 66.3% of biosensor revenue globally, and show promise for applications in a regulated environment. 20 15 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2013).

With more frequent travel, globalised trade and greater interconnectedness between countries, infectious disease outbreaks of international concern are becoming inevitable and unpredictable. 21 When combined with increased treatment resistance, this creates dangerous situations that require rapid medical technology responses. Clinical leaders are important influencers for combating outbreaks, both by informing the responsible use of medicines to prolong effectiveness, and through development and release of accessible technologies and tools to combat pandemic outbreaks. Antimicrobial resistance is another complex global public health crisis that threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections. Antimicrobial resistance will make the treatment of infections more difficult, costly, or even impossible. 22 For the pharmaceutical sector, medicines that are no longer effective lose their value. Since the 1980s, there has been a 'discovery void' with the pipeline for the development of new antibacterial drugs very limited. 23 21 World Health Organization Website (2016).

Real time measurement and assessment of individual health will create demand for product and service providers that can offer integrated best fit solutions, rather than single best inclass products. Key implications for Australian developments is navigating the regulatory process in such a way that reimbursement for bespoke products is achieved. 15 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2013).

Technology and information access are empowering patients to become more proactive in managing their healthcare. Examples of this include the informed selection of clinicians and treatment options; health status tracking via personal health records, wearable sensors and inhome monitors; and directly contributing to personal health data. 24 25 Technology and information access are empowering patients to become more proactive in managing their healthcare. 79% of Australians own a smartphone. 26 24 Business Council of Australia (2015).

Standardisation of how data is shared across the industry will accelerate the development of new treatments, technologies and predictive systems, targeting both the individual and the wider health system. 30 The upside is improved efficiency from R&D through to patient care co ordination; the downside is a growing cybersecurity risk as more data is exchanged. 31 Big Data from a variety of sources (medical diagnostic technologies, population health, clinical research, etc.) can be used to improve the efficiency and productivity of clinical trials, drug discovery, regulatory approval processes, basic research, and patient care coordination. 32 Advances in technology and increased connectivity of patients, devices and equipment are shaping a digitally enabled and integrated health system (eHealth). This will foster growth in telehealth services, where remote monitoring, video conferencing and remote services allow patients to monitor their health at home, reducing the length of time in hospital. mHealth (mobile health) applications will also grow as the development of mobile applications and communication technologies help patients manage and monitor certain aspects of their healthcare, often leveraging wearable technology. 33 30 The Australian E Health Research Centre Website (2016).

Developing markets are responsible for the majority of global sector growth (in percentage terms) and this trend will continue. However, it is important to note that the needs of these markets are at times distinct from developed economies. For example, there is demand for lower cost solutions such as generics and biosimilars, or diagnostics that can be implemented at the point ofcare. 34 Generic brands represent significant sales and volume in many emerging markets, accounting for 75% of the volume of prescriptions in China in 2015, and over 70% in India. 35 Approximately US $70-$80 billion worth of biologics will lose exclusivity over the next five years, which will stimulate rapid growth in the market for biosimilars. 36 37 Considerable market potential exists for biosimilars in emerging markets where patented biologics are currently deemed too expensive. 38 In developing countries, various strategies are being employed to improve access to affordable medicines, where it is estimated that one third of people are unable to receive or purchase essential medicines on a regular basis. Differential pricing (lower prices in developing countries) and compulsory licences (government authorised production of patented products without the consent of the patent owner) are two strategies that aim to increase access to affordable medicines in the developing world. 39 34 PWC Health Research Institute (2015).

Under this new model, companies look to create platforms that enable them to provide solutions along the continuum of care. 42 42 Frost & Sullivan (2015). Analysis of the Mobile Health (mHealth) market in Australia , Mountain View.Integrated care programs are associated with a 19% reduction in hospital -admission rates , compared with usual care. 43 43 Dorling G., et al (2015). The Evidence for Integrated Care , McKinsey&Company. 3.2.7 INTEGRATED CARE Countries are shifting from highly fragmented healthcare systems to those based on end to end integration, driven by the need to meet the changing demands of patients and to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery which is burdened by an ageing population and rising incidence of chronic disease. This model of care is centred on preventative actions for the individual, providing a continuum of care for both acute and chronic disease management. A number of technologies, conditions and elements are enabling Integrated Healthcare models to emerge including: increased digitisation of healthcare, such as electronic health records; complex and high quality data collection; improved analytics and sharing of data; greater consumer engagement; education and empowerment to drive demand; multidisciplinary research teams, and individual care plans. 41 41 Retterath, M., et al (2013). Opportunities in integrated care for pharma and medtech, Bain & Company. Implications for the Australian MTP sector As demand increases for Integrated Care models, products and devices that can coexist and communicate with other products and information sources will be required. Ongoing integrated patient management will require products that are packaged as part of a broader care proposition to the healthcare system. Implications for the Australian MTP sector Developing countries will continue to be a growing market for and strong source of demand for MTP and healthcare solutions. Value can be created by partnering with businesses and governments in developing markets to understand their unique needs and providing knowhow and tech transfer to assist new product development, optimised manufacturing and distribution solutions for their local markets. Australia can leverage its highquality production advantage in the short term, and collaborate over the longer term to develop solutions to deliver high quality and sophisticated technologies, products and healthcare to developing countries in a more costeffective manner. As demand increases for Integrated Care models, products and devices that can coexist and communicate with other products and information sources will be required. 41 Retterath, M., et al (2013).

Although described discretely throughout this chapter, the growth opportunities will exhibit a degree of convergence and interaction, as shown in Figure 11. Each opportunity is described in detail over the following chapter, outlining the ecosystem changes required over the short, medium and long term. Importantly, research priorities from classic MTP fields and convergent technology areas are outlined that will enable the transformational shifts required for opportunity success.4 Opportunities for growth Four long term growth opportunities for the Australian MTP sector have been identified, driven by global megatrends and leveraging Australia's comparative advantages. FIGURE 11: RELATIONSHIP AND INTERPLAY BETWEEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES If realised concurrently, the opportunities have a synergistic relationship. Each opportunity provides reciprocal benefits, and will benefit from the shared cumulative knowledge that is developed in the pursuit of success. As the opportunity outcomes mature there will be the possibility to pursue new opportunities that leverage new sector know how and enhanced sector characteristics.

This opportunity would see improvements regarding the approach of the Australian regulatory system to personalised devices, and greater levels of digital integration between individuals, clinicians, researchers and developers, resulting in the development of expert systems. DRIVING MEGATRENDS PRECISION HEALTHCARE - accessibility of technology that allows highly customised implants and bionics is rapidly increasing, driven by long-term patient benefits and improved outcomes. DIGITAL EVOLUTION - as connectivity and data interoperability challenges are overcome, rapid integration of communicative medical technology into consumer and clinical environments will occur. CONSUMER CONTROL - early adopters are driving the demand for wearable and integrated technology, and will demonstrate the advantages associated with making data -driven medical decisions. 214.1.1 THE OPPORTUNITY Australia's MTP sector has the opportunity to become a leading global player in the research, development and manufacturing of smart and connected medical devices. Specifically, this includes personalised implants, bionics and monitoring devices, and the systems required to fully utilise the information captured by these devices (Figure 12). An ageing global population combined with a rising middle class, will drive demand for the MTP solutions arising from this opportunity. In Australia alone there is a significant potential market for smarter and personalised medical technology; approximately 4.2 million Australians experience some form of physical disability, with over 30% experiencing profound or severe core activity limitation. 44 45 Over 357,000 Australians are blind or have low vision; 30,000 have total hearing loss; 20,000 are amputees; and approximately 42,000 hip replacements and 53,000 knee replacements took place in 2013 14. 46 47 48 Increasing Australia's focus on smart devices, implants and bionics will create skilled jobs and the development of agile medtech companies. 44 ABS (2013). 4430.0 - Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Summary of Findings, 2012, Canberra. 45 ABS (2013). 4430.0 - Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Disability tables - Table 2, Canberra. 46 Australian Network on Disability Website, Stats and Facts, [Online] Available from: http://www.and.org.au/pages/disability statistics.html Accessed 19/12/2016. 47 Australian Orthotic Prosthetic Association (2010).

As the concentration of companies focusing on these technologies grows, international investors and global companies will be attracted to Australian shores. These, together with Australia's existing mature medical technology companies (see 'Many mature medtech companies call Australia home' case study), can be leveraged to access global value chains to export Australian ideas, building the industry brand in the process. In Australia alone, there is a significant market for smarter and personalised medical technology. Along with developing industry leadership in novel devices, Australia can also lead the development and implementation of innovative smart information ecosystems - creating an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) model through the collection, de identification (where necessary) and interpretation of data from integrated medical devices. This data will provide clinicians with valuable patient and population insights that can be used to help personalise treatments and predict the likelihood of disease, enabling preventative actions and treatments. Data from these devices can be a key input to the different types of diagnostic and informatics products discussed in Section 4.4.4.1 Smart devices, implants and bionics 44 ABS (2013). 4430.0 - Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Summary of Findings, 2012, Canberra. 45 ABS (2013). 4430.0 - Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Disability tables - Table 2, Canberra. 46 Australian Network on Disability Website, Stats and Facts, [Online] Available from: http://www.and.org.au/pages/disability statistics.html Accessed 19/12/2016. 47 Australian Orthotic Prosthetic Association (2010).

FIGURE 12: OPPORTUNITY FOCUS AREAS 23Case study Mature medtech companies call Australia home Cochlear, Cook Medical Australia and ResMed are major medical technology companies with international operating models and major manufacturing centres in Australia. Together these companies are responsible for over 20% of the total inventions in the medical devices field in Australia (based on IP registration). 49 As mature international companies, these firms have the ability to set up manufacturing centres in any location, but choose to manufacture products for the Asia Pacific region and beyond from facilities in Australia. Cochlear Ltd is an Australian company with global operations. The company's global headquarters is located on campus at Macquarie University in Sydney, however, Cochlear has direct operations in 20 countries and exports to over 100 countries. For over three decades, Cochlear has been developing and manufacturing a range of implants, investing more than $100 million each year in research and development, with the majority of these R&D activities taking place in Australia. Most of Cochlear's manufacturing takes place in Australia and Sweden, with smaller sites in Belgium and the USA. In 2016, Cochlear's Asia Pacific (APAC) sales totalled over $210 million (18% of total sales) while the major markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and the Americas totalled over $427 and $519 million respectively. 50 William A. Cook Australia Pty Ltd manufactures two key product ranges specialising in IVF and endovascular repair, and exports over 92% to 135 countries at a value exceeding US$100 million. The products are manufactured in the company's Brisbane facility, which employs over 500 staff. The Australian operations also double as the headquarters for the APAC region. In 2015, Cook achieved an annual sales figure of US $408 million for the APAC region, which is their 33rd year of consecutive growth. 51 ResMed Ltd was established in Australia in 1989 to commercialise a device to treat and manage obstructive sleep apnoea. Since then, ResMed has grown dramatically to become an international company, active in more than 100 countries through direct offices and distribution networks, and employing over 5,000 people. ResMed has six manufacturing facilities across the globe, with its largest facility located in Sydney, Australia. This Australian facility manufactures ResMed's full product range and employs 1,360 staff. Approximately 95% of the company's products manufactured in Australia are exported to other countries. ResMed's global R&D spend is approximately $163 million, of which $100 million is expended in Australia. 52 49 IP Australia (2014).

Strong international reputation for quality - Australia's medical technology sector comprises over 500 companies and has established a global reputation and track record for being inventive in the areas of bionics and implants, with device companies such as Cochlear Ltd, Cook Medical Australia and ResMed (see Case Study) providing industry leadership. 53 Sector maturity makes it easier for start ups and SMEs to gain access to the knowledge, value chains and infrastructure needed to succeed. A strong research community - Australia's strongest categories of published research include engineering, materials science, clinical medicine, molecular biology and genetics, fields required in the development of this opportunity. 54 Australia is home to world leading research programs that feed this opportunity, such as the translation of neuroscience research into new devices, 55 development of next generation implants and devices, 56 and the 3D bioprinting of replacement body parts. 57 Diverse culture, social economic stability, and unique location - Australians have a reputation for being early adopters of innovations and new technologies, with already high adoption rates for wearable technologies. 58 By 2025, it is expected that virtual consults will surpass facetoface patient consultations in rural regions. 59 Australia's many rural and remote communities provide a great test bed for telehealth service innovation, aided by smart monitoring from wearable devices and communicative implants. In addition, Australia has a rich mineral wealth, currently supplying 51% of the world's titanium ore, which is a key material used for the production of some medical devices. 60 53 Australian Trade Commission (2016).

Reputable national regulatory authority - Australia has a robust regulatory environment that allows rapid development, improvement and refinement cycles, making it an ideal market for prototyping and testing new medical technologies. 61 Competitors Australia faces competition scientifically, commercially and politically from a number of countries that are building capability across relevant technical areas and are establishing attractive economic environments as a method to attract international business investment for the development of growth industries. 62 Strong competition in the field of bionics comes from US, Canada, and Germany, 63 while competition for customised medical implants is predominantly from the US. 64 The US Government has invested heavily in bionics and implantable device research through various projects at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Australia needs to ensure continued investment in these areas to maintain the development of relevant businesses onshore (see SmartStent case study). Australia's MTP sector also faces competition from a number of non traditional companies. For example, the collection and interpretation of medical data sees strong competition from a range of consumer driven companies, such as Alphabet (Google's parent company that acquired the artificial intelligence company, Deepmind, in 2014) and Apple (medical data integration into an application ecosystem driven by developer packages such as CareKit and ResearchKit). These companies have total R&D expenditure that rivals entire developed countries, with Alphabet spending USD $12.3 billion in 2015. 65 61 Australian Trade Commission (2016).

The technology offers a means for acquiring, translating and transmitting brain signals to robotic devices to aid movement in patients suffering from paralysis or injury. Funded through grants from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the NHMRC and the Australian Research Council, the technology has been developed in Melbourne with a pool of expertise largely accumulated through the bionic ear and bionic eye research programs, as well as medical research at Royal Melbourne Hospital, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and University of Melbourne. The company has recently being transferred to the US through establishment of a parent company based in Silicon Valley, Synchron Inc, with the appointment of an experienced medical technology CEO. 66 Smartstent website, About Us, [Online] Available from: http:// smartstent.com.au/about us/ Accessed 20/12/2016.Under current modes of healthcare reimbursement, the primary buyers should ultimately be governments and insurance companies. However, the benefits provided by these technologies may encourage some patients and certain companies to source the technologies without subsidy. With early adopters demonstrating the success and cost benefits associated with these types of innovations, governments and insurance companies may be more likely to introduce subsidy programs for the wider population. Examples of key markets that could become early adopters thanks to the benefits from these smart technologies include: Defence technologies - bionics for rapid recovery and rehabilitation from injuries. Research entities such as DARPA in the United States are investigating the use of bionic technologies to assist soldiers with war related physical disabilities. Over 50,000 people were wounded in action in the US military between 2001 and 2015. 67 Elderly healthcare - devices for improved quality of life. Devices that monitor and communicate between clinicians and patients will enable the reduction of significant adverse health events, helping to decrease the cost associated with delivering aged care while improving outcomes. Research is underway to develop bionics to help return movement function to patients after significant events such as stroke, where patients may incur neurological deficits or paralysis. High health risk industries - monitoring devices for workers in mines, fatigue prone occupations or other high risk environments. For example, commercial trucking is the focus of many communicative devices to help monitor stress, fatigue, and illness common in the profession. In Australia, around 42% of truck crashes are due to fatigue. Monitoring devices for heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and glucose level monitoring are expected to become commonplace to measure and improve the productivity and health of truck drivers. 68 67 Fischer, H., (2015).

Growth Opportunity Analysis of Health, Wellness, and Wellbeing Technologies in Commercial Trucking , Mountain View. 26 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaOpportunity threats Societal and cultural acceptance (social licence to operate) is required for smart implants that monitor, respond and transmit data, as well as for bionic devices that can be visually confronting. Western cultures, for example, are culturally less accepting of devices that make humans appear robotic, which could hinder early uptake in countries such as Australia. 69 In a similar cultural context, there is an underlying apprehension toward devices that collect personal information, based on the potential inappropriate use of data. Cybersecurity risks will need to be mitigated and communicated. Failing to achieve growth and support research translation will result in Australian patients having to import or travel overseas to access cutting edge medical devices and implants, with the Australian sector losing the value, exports and jobs that may be created. 69 Ross, A., (2016). The Industries of the Future , Simon & Schuster.Ecosystem changes Currently, lack of reimbursement for smart and personalised implants and bionics is restraining growth associated with this opportunity, not only in Australia but across the globe. Access to customised devices is challenging, as many are excluded from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, making reimbursement impossible. Local growth will require a regulatory environment that is responsive to these technologies and can accommodate the clinical sample size of n=1 that is characteristic of bespoke devices. High levels of customisation not only challenge the regulatory system, but disrupts the existing supply chain, requiring new skills, an accepting culture, and an agile industry structure. Regulatory environment and market access - Australia's regulatory body, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), does not currently have the ability to provide rapid and binding feedback for presubmission, something that competing countries offer. 70 Existing frameworks have incorporated some flexibility for customised devices, but reimbursement can be limited, assessed on a case bycase basis. More value will be captured by the Australian industry if next generation devices are readily accessible through public healthcare and private health insurance. Any efficiencies that Australia may achieve in the regulatory environment will provide a significant sectoral advantage. Skills, culture and industry development - Accessible and localised manufacturing hubs will become critical for the design and refinement of customised implants to occur in tight collaboration with the clinician, the patient, and multidisciplinary experts. Skills development, patient and community acceptance, as well as funder and investor education will be important for the growth of this opportunity. Technology outputs - Tight integration between MTP businesses, clinicians and the research community is needed to advance technologies and services, moving beyond isolated wearables towards customised and communicative implants, and bionics that are controlled by neural stimulation. 70 Medicines Australia (2015).

Case study Anatomics 71 Demonstrating the growing importance of customisation in medical technologies is Anatomics Pty Ltd, a Melbourne based medical device company that specialises in the manufacture of patient specific implants. Operating since 1996, Anatomics has pioneered the use of medical imaging to develop personalised surgical implants that utilise innovative advanced manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing, saving time in the operating theatre and enabling better patient outcomes. The range of customised implants Anatomics designs and manufactures allow surgeons to consider a whole new suite of operations that were once impossible. Implants are manufactured from a range of materials including acrylic, titanium and porous polyethylene. Anatomics has helped over 4,000 patients with its customised implants. In a world first surgery, one patient received a 3D printed titanium rib and sternum implant after suffering from a chest wall sarcoma that resulted in a large portion of the rib and sternum being removed. The 3D printed implant closely mimics the original bone that had to be removed. In another world first, Anatomics recently designed and manufactured a 3D printed vertebrae to replace two cancerous vertebrae from a patient's neck, allowing anatomically correct replacement for better outcomes. 71 Anatomics website, Company , [Online] Accessed 19/12/2016. 29Enabling science and technology Technology and research priorities to further enable the development of smart devices, implants and bionics will need to focus on materials and communications.

This opportunity would result in an increasing number of businesses completing pharmaceutical development in Australia, improving activity in the high value service sector and an increase in the rate of local research being pulled through to a higher value inflection point and ultimately exported to the global market in the form of IP. DRIVING MEGATRENDS CHRONIC BURDEN - increasing chronic disease will drive the demand for more effective pharmaceutical solutions, ideally curbing the cost associated with maintaining a high quality of population health. DEVELOPING MARKETS - as countries' build a better understanding of region specific health and medical challenges there will be increased demand for clinical development of pharmaceutical products. GLOBAL BIOSECURITY - developed and developing countries are placing more importance on biosecurity medical counter measures; rapid and agile clinical development is critical to meet the demands associated with combating emerging infectious diseases and microbial pandemics. 314.2.1 THE OPPORTUNITY Australia's MTP sector has the opportunity to cultivate a globally competitive pharmaceutical development environment, taking targeted local and international drug candidates/discoveries and accelerating them through to first inhuman phase 1 clinical trials (Figure 15). Successfully reaching phase 1 is a significant milestone in the pharmaceutical development pathway, leading to a major increase in the value of the drug candidate in development. Accelerated pharmaceutical development involves connecting competitive clinical trials, services in preclinical research and development, and efficient ethics and regulatory processes. Annually, the Australian clinical trials industry is estimated to be worth $1 billion to the economy. 73 Putting concentrated effort into becoming a global hub for efficient, high quality, early stage, pre clinical and clinical research will have many positive economic and social benefits for Australia, including: Growth in the pipeline of pre clinical and phase 1 products being developed and trialled in Australia, from both local and international research. Attraction of large global companies to Australia to both conduct their own trials and to scout for acquisitions targets with high potential value. Sector growth through the development of clinical trials expertise and associated infrastructure. Improved local access to cutting edge medicines (and devices). 73 Australian Government, Department of Health website (2016).

A demonstrated ability to increase the speed at which pharmaceuticals can enter firstinhuman trials should benefit development time frames for medical technologies in Australia. Increasing Australian activity in pre clinical and phase 1 trials will help the MTP sector extract more value from Australia's globally competitive medical and biotechnology research investments, leading to more therapies progressing further along the development pathway. Companies that utilise Australia for clinical trials are more likely to pursue market access in Australia, improving access to innovative pharmaceuticals. This opportunity will ultimately enable faster and more efficient translation of therapies and medicines to meet unmet medical needs, while creating value for the Australian MTP sector. There are multiple research areas where Australia has respectable international standing, such as oncology and cardiovascular disease, and these should be used as inputs to develop critical mass for this opportunity. Areas of national and regional importance, such as emerging infectious disease, can also supply significant pipelines for rapid development to first inhuman trials.

Australia's perceived advantages for clinical trials often vary depending on the perspective of the company looking to conduct these trials. For example, Chinese companies often look to Australia for transparent approval processes that produce clinical results that are acceptable by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while US companies look to Australia for cost efficiency and approval timeliness. 78 Australia ranks first in the APAC region for scientific research productivity and impact, which assists Australia in standing out from the rest of the region. 79 76 Australian Trade Commission (2015). Clinical Trials, Commonwealth of Australia. 77 Frost & Sullivan (2016). Australia: Preferred Destination for Early Phase Clinical Trials. 78 Frost & Sullivan (2016). Australia: Preferred Destination for Early Phase Clinical Trials. 79 Frost & Sullivan (2016). Australia: Preferred Destination for Early Phase Clinical Trials.Competitors For clinical trials, the key competition Australia faces comes from the greater APAC region. Between 2007 and 2013, the number of new clinical trials in Australia declined due to increasing competition from Asia and other regions. However, this decline has been moderated with growth in numbers over more recent years. 80 Despite this recent growth, the proportion of phase 1 first inhuman trials in Australia is still low, representing 17% of all trials initiated in Australia in 2015. 81 Partners and buyers The main partner and buyer for this opportunity are large global pharmaceutical companies that license or acquire target therapies once success in pre clinical and phase 1 trials is achieved. Building a sustainable and significant pipeline of drug candidates reaching these milestones may attract companies to Australia that require portfolio expansion or are driven by an acquisition strategy. In the event that Australia can become an attractive destination for large companies looking to conduct early clinical trials, it will be able to capture part of a global market expected to exceed $56 billion by 2020. 82 Once present, many global companies may choose to progress drug candidates through phase 2 and phase 3 trials in Australia as well. Other significant partners could include defence agencies and consortia, such as the Medical Counter Measures (MCM) Consortium, involving Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, where the ability to rapidly develop and test MCM solutions will be highly valued. 83 Key regions that represent lucrative partners and buyers of pharmaceuticals developed in Australia include those with rapidly changing demographics, such as members of BRICS and ASEAN economies, who have increasing demands for pharmaceutical solutions and are geographically or politically aligned to Australia. 80 L.E.K.

The cost of conducting clinical trials in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia is generally between 25 40% lower than that in Western countries. 86 With China expected to experience rapid growth in clinical trials over the short term, the Australian industry needs to remain competitive by focusing on quality factors as a differentiator. Failing to position Australia's early stage clinical trials industry for global recognition and growth could leave patients in Australia with limited access to early new treatments, and reduce the link between basic and clinical research, making development of new therapies more difficult. The ultimate consequence of non activity is that the Australian sector will have little relevance to global pharmaceutical companies, and with a small domestic market, many will not pursue market access for their products in Australia. With China expected to experience rapid growth in clinical trials over the short term, the Australian industry needs to remain competitive by focusing on quality factors as a differentiator. 86 Frost & Sullivan (2015).

APAC Contract Research Organisation (CRO) Market, Mountain View. 354.2.3 PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE Developing and nurturing Australia's early stage clinical trials industry to become globally competitive will require a coordinated effort from government, regulators, industry and research. To capture this opportunity a focus should be to increase the number and proportion of early stage trials completed in Australia. In time, Australia should focus on increasing its capacity to operate phase 2 multi site trials to complement enhanced competitiveness in early stage trials. Accelerated pharmaceutical development in the 2030s Australian trials are quick to start-up and reach recruitment targets, producing valuable high quality data. Australia is known for its safe and efficient regulatory environment and streamlined ethical approval processes. Australia is a recognised destination for challenging early stage clinical trials. Australia has a strong research focus on the rapid development of solutions for infectious diseases, biosecurity risks and novel approaches to treatments for existing acute and chronic diseases. Australia has witnessed a noticeable increase in the rate of discovery research being pulled through to a global market, either taken through to market access by an Australian company, or by global licensing deals.Ecosystem changes A number of recent Australian reviews have highlighted the importance of this opportunity to the Australian MTP sector and the need for broader ecosystem changes to capture it: the Clinical Trials Action Group (CTAG), established in 2009 put forward 11 recommendations to secure Australia's competitiveness in the clinical trials sector, 87 and the 2013 Strategic Review of Health and Medical Research in Australia: Summary Report (the McKeon Review) made recommendations that reinforced those of the CTAG, listing them as an urgent national priority. 88 Furthermore, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is working with States, Territories, clinical trials sites, sponsors and researchers to improve clinical trials in Australia in response to the CTAG and McKeon recommendations by achieving: 89 timely and more efficient research governance authorisation efficient ethics approval Increased site readiness and transparency better training of staff increased recruitment and awareness. While a number of these recommendations have now been fully or partially implemented, more work needs to be done to ensure long term growth. 87 Commonwealth of Australia (2011).

Research priorities to enable these technical developments are detailed below. FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES ICT Model, study and implement appropriate technology for traceable, sharable, ethical, trackable and secure electronic health records for all Australians to enhance clinical trials data. Develop systems and platforms for eClinical trial solutions to help standardise and manage processes and enable virtual ethics reviews. Seamless connection of national research, trials and care based information systems, enabling easier collaboration. Regulatory Science Improved models and protocols for Australian preclinical toxicology studies and drug candidate optimisation, including: absorption , distribution , metabolism bioanalysis), drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) studies. Focus on demonstrating safety using new approaches to data science and statistical modelling.Focused basic research Biologics - improve understanding on the development and manufacture of complex biologics. Diseases that threaten the biosecurity of Australia and neighbouring regions. Emerging infectious diseases that are of potential significant global impact. The clinical translation of emerging therapeutic focus areas such as gene therapy, and technology areas of heightened complexity such as stem cell therapies. Regulatory science for clinical focus areas where Australia has an existing strength, such as chronic diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular), neuro degenerative disorders, oncology, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, and tropical medicine. 39Manufacturing high-value pharmaceuticals VISION To focus Australian manufacturing efforts toward high value and niche pharmaceutical products that create sustainable export revenue. Australia can leverage advantages around ingenuity, quality and reliability to attract businesses without the capacity to develop complex production processes in house. This would see an increase in the number of local development teams required to manufacture products for direct export or clinical development. DRIVING MEGATRENDS CHRONIC BURDEN - increasing incidence of chronic diseases has created an increase in demand for pharmaceuticals, many of which are complex to manufacture and require reliable and efficient production environments. DEVELOPING MARKETS - developing economies represent significant markets for all pharmaceutical products, in particular, complex high-quality generics and biosimilars. GLOBAL BIOSECURITY - developed economies like Australia, with an educated and skilled workforce, access to key infrastructure, and stable supply-chains, will be critical for manufacturing therapies needed in markets which endure less stable environments. 40 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for Australia4.3.1 THE OPPORTUNITY Driven by an increased global demand for MTP solutions, 92 the Australian MTP sector has an opportunity to create value by developing, manufacturing and supplying international markets with niche high value pharmaceutical products. Products could include novel biologics, biosimilars, and a range of small molecules from synthetic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to naturally derived compounds. The commonality between these products is that they require complex manufacturing processes to reach and maintain the required level of quality. Importantly, these products have a high cost per unit weight, which mitigates numerous Australian comparative disadvantages. Biologics and biosimilars requiring a high degree of manufacturing complexity are of particular significance for the Australian sector with these products exhibiting significant capacity for growth. 93 As a class of products, they have gained rapid market share and are expected to comprise over 27% of the global pharmaceutical market by 2020. 94 Of the 20 top selling global pharmaceuticals, eight are biologics set to lose patent protection by 2020. 95 As these patents expire, the market for biosimilars will witness rapid growth, especially in developing markets. By 2020, the global market for biologics and biosimilars is expected to generate revenues of over US $290 billion, and US $25 billion respectively. 96 Biologics manufacturing has historically been restricted due to several factors including the complex manufacturing processes and high skill sets requirements. 97 Beyond biologics, it is anticipated that all categories across the pharmaceutical sector will exhibit growth as economies develop and increase their demand for medical solutions. This will cover everything from patented small molecules through to over thecounter drugs and high value complementary medicines. To capture value, Australia must define which of these are going to benefit most from innovations in manufacturing and production processes, and which markets are going to put most value on quality, reliability and provenance. For manufacturing (contract and in house) in particular, there must be a level of technological complexity or value add for Australia to compete with low cost markets. 92 OECD (2015).

What is a biologic? Biological medicines or biopharmaceuticals (biologics) are defined by the TGA as therapeutic goods that are derived from biological sources and are regulated as registered medicines. They include proteins and polysaccharides such as: vaccines products of the fermentation of recombinant cell-lines medicines derived from the fluids and tissue of humans and animals bacterially-derived proteins animal-derived polysaccharides such as heparin. Biologics do not include antibiotics and small peptides or molecules <2500 Da. What is a biosimilar? A biosimilar is a version of an already registered biologic that has a demonstrable similarity in physicochemical, biological and immunological characteristics, efficacy and safety, based on comprehensive comparability studies.

IDT offers a full range of contract pharmaceutical product development and manufacturing services, from API development through to commercial finished dose manufacturing, specialising in difficult to manufacture drugs. Traditionally IDT has sold API's and provided contract manufacturing, drug development and R&D services, however, recently the company has gained approval to market its first proprietary generic drug product, the oral chemotherapy drug temozolomide. In pursuing this opportunity, IDT aims to increase the company's share of the wholesale price and capture additional value by undertaking the registration and sale of its own drug product portfolio. 98 To support the sale of temozolomide and 24 other drugs in development in their pipeline, IDT has established international sales channels through relationships with Mayne Pharma and ANI Pharmaceuticals in the USA and is actively exploring opportunities in other geographical markets. 99 98 IDT Australia Limited (2013).

This brand is especially strong in the Asian region. Highly skilled and educated workforce - Australia's highly educated graduates and quality workforce skills enable the industry to find and protect answers to complex challenges inherent in manufacturing biologics and other complicated products. Ensuring Australia has a skilled workforce, particularly in STEMM fields is crucial to capturing this opportunity. A strong research community - Australia has numerous research programs focused on complex pharmaceuticals, providing the sector with know how to remain competitive. CSIRO has research programs that focus on biomedical manufacturing and Australia's Monash University is ranked number four in the world in pharmacy and pharmacology, according to the 2016 QS World University Rankings. 100 Reputable national regulatory system - Australian manufacturers have a quality advantage over companies in Asian countries due to Australia's stringent regulatory system, skilled workforce and track record of high quality, clean and safe manufacturing. This reputation has been developed by a cultural attitude that embraces a strong regulatory approach to any products and services that may compromise the safety of an individual, and while it may hinder agility in the development of new products and services, it creates output of a highly reliable and safe nature, which are highly appealing product attributes for this market segment. Diverse culture, social economic stability, and unique location - Australia's geographic and social proximity to economies undergoing healthcare transformation provides a valuable advantage over other countries. As does Australia's supply chain security and stability of inputs required to enable the production of complex pharmaceutical products, such as the quality of tap water through to the inherent stability of the workforce. 100 Top Universities website (2016).

There are a growing number of CMOs in emerging markets, particularly in the BRICS economies, however, these competitors may inadvertently strengthen Australia's global position as a high quality manufacturer of high quality complex pharmaceuticals due to the problems they face with manufacturing, delivery, service and product quality. 102 However, the changing operating models of global CMOs does highlight that Australian industry must ensure competitiveness by offering commercial development services alongside the manufacture of complex pharmaceuticals. Partners and buyers Key buyers include global companies looking to leverage Australia's location, brand and quality to access Asia, as well as companies looking to manufacture product for clinical trials. Small and medium pharmaceutical companies represent key buyers, as they outsource between 60 70% of manufacturing, due to lack of manufacturing infrastructure and skills. It is estimated that big pharmaceutical companies outsource only 20 25% of biologic manufacturing with the remainder kept in house due to intellectual property concerns. 103 Small and medium pharmaceutical companies represent key buyers, as they outsource between 60 70% of manufacturing, due to lack of manufacturing infrastructure and skills. 101 Frost & Sullivan (2016).

The centre draws upon Australian pharmaceutical research and manufacturing expertise, combining skills and ideas to develop next generation formulations and platform technologies. Initially established with $3.3 million of funding from the Victorian Science Agenda Investment Fund and GSK, GSK has since invested over $100 million to expand its manufacturing presence in Victoria. In October 2016, building on the success of GSK's collaboration with MIPS, the company announced support for Australia's manufacturing industry as a founding partner for the Victorian Medicine Manufacturing Innovation Centre (MMIC). The MMIC will provide medicine manufacturers with access to specialist scientific capabilities to solve technical challenges as well as encouraging investment in research and development, high tech manufacturing, skills development and collaboration. The success of GSK's collaborations have played a key role in the decision by GSK to remain in Australia and invest an additional $7.7 million in its 'blow fillseal' advanced manufacturing capability located in Melbourne, a decision that will create almost 60 new highly skilled jobs. GSK exports approximately 75% of the medicines manufactured in Australia to 58 countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia. 104 GSK website (2016).

While Australia's limited market size is indicated to be one of the unavoidable disadvantages, the purchasing power of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) provides single point negotiations with annual expenditure of over $10.8 billion, a lucrative buyer for any pharmaceutical manufacturer. 105 Other buyers will be those countries and companies that lack the ability or scale to manufacture highly complex pharmaceutical products, and are willing to develop longterm relationships with Australian manufacturers to do so on their behalf. For example, international governments looking to strengthen their biosecurity preparedness might value access to Australian manufacturers that are able to rapidly produce niche products. In this context, remaining a partner and enabler of this opportunity for its own biosecurity measures is an important consideration for the Australian Government. Buyers with a purely cost focused outcome are not a desirable target. Partners for businesses looking to capitalise on this opportunity could be research organisations that can help streamline and overcome complex manufacturing problems, and marketing and distribution partners to provide efficient access to high value markets. Opportunity threats Failing to support growth in complex pharmaceutical manufacturing will result in lower contributions from high value manufacturing to Australia's GDP. Australia will instead be an importer of these products from other regions, missing out on employment and economic growth as well as access to high quality pharmaceuticals. Australia is dependent on international manufacturers for products required to combat biosecurity threats and needs to pre emptively stock pile. If stock piling falls short, Australia is dependent on the good will of allies for continued access to complex pharmaceutical products. 105 Thomas, G., Marlton, P ., (2016). Expenditure and Prescriptions Twelve Months to 30 June 2016, PBS Information Management Section, Pharmaceutical Policy Branch.4.3.3 PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE Transitioning Australia into a hub for manufacturing and export of complex pharmaceuticals requires coordination of skills and training, infrastructure and incentives, and needs to be supported by cutting edge process technologies and research platforms. Ecosystem changes There are a number of possible roadblocks that can inhibit the success of Australia's complex pharmaceutical manufacturing sector; as such, it is critical that businesses align efforts to realise this opportunity. Skills and infrastructure - Competitive advantage will be gained through the creation, development and support of state oftheart manufacturing infrastructure that supports commercial scale up and incorporates novel emerging technologies, a skilled and agile workforce, and an intellectual property system that provides global companies with peace of mind. Market access and sales - A fundamental enabler for this opportunity is access to global markets for new entrants in Australia. An excellent demonstration of this is the cohorts of industry groups that undertake international trade missions to promote Australian capabilities, and this should be continued and encouraged at a much larger scale. There is an opportunity for the Australian Government to support the sector in this regard through the diplomatic relationships it can develop with neighbouring countries, particularly for international matters related to biosecurity and medical counter measures. Outcomes - The MTP sector will need to work with the research community to overcome complex manufacturing problems and develop world class manufacturing facilities to build Australia's reputation as a trusted complex manufacturing hub. 105 Thomas, G., Marlton, P ., (2016).

This opportunity is driven by a need to develop efficiency in healthcare delivery, and will help establish strong growth in the MTP sector via novel data services. In the past decade there has been an explosion in the variety and volume of health data collected. Patient data sources span research and clinical study data generated 4.4 Diagnostic and informatics products and services FIGURE 20: CAPTURING VALUE FROM HEALTH, MEDICAL AND POPULATION DATAfrom genomics, epigenomics and proteomics, data from traditional clinical diagnostics such as imaging and pathology, through to the numerous options for patients to collect their own physiological data on a daily basis via wearables (see Section 4.1 -Smart devices, implants and bionics). Figure 20 highlights some of the ways value can be captured from the use of de identified or confidential patient data. So far, patient data has not been effectively utilised as its value can only be realised when integrated with a broader set of patient and population information - a challenge that has nuanced quality, security and integration requirements. As outlined in the figure, Australia can create a strong competitive advantage by focusing on the development of diagnostic platforms that will generate complex patient data, concurrently developing services around data collection, data packaging and data access. These services will also work with existing data sources. The ultimate outcomes are next generation MTP solutions, driven by complex data. 49Beyond the technical challenges, new service and business models will need to address cultural challenges as part of their development process. For example, cultural acceptance of the use of confidential or de identified patient data can be increased by communicating how preventative and precision products will improve patient wellbeing. New business models and services will need to be developed in a way that takes advantage of existing infrastructure, and can be scaled up as reliability and performance success is demonstrated. If successful in capturing value from patient data, the Australian sector will gain a strong global advantage in the development of data driven diagnostic and informatics products. A data driven MTP environment in Australia will cultivate the testing and development of truly preventative and precision MTP solutions. If successful in capturing value from patient data, the Australian sector will gain a strong global advantage in the development of data driven diagnostic and informatics products.Casy study Complex Data Integration A number of alliances have been established with the goal of integrating genomics data into the broader Australian health and medical ecosystem. A fundamental driver behind these alliances is the need to standardise access to information to develop effective preventative and precision solutions. The Australian Genomics Health Alliance (AGHA) is a network of 47 partner organisations including research institutes, hospitals and universities. It aims to enable Australia to become a global leader in the translation of genomics data for cancer and rare diseases into preventative solutions for the Australian healthcare system. 112 Queensland 113 and Victoria have similar state based alliances, with the Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance demonstrating that patients get a faster and more accurate diagnosis when genomic sequencing is efficiently utilised, resulting in patients requiring fewer tests as the data can be stored and analysed multiple times. 114 These alliances indicate that with limited investment Australia has been able to link together platforms that deal with significant volumes of complex data. 112 Australian Genomics Health Alliance website, Our Approach, [Online] Available from: https://www.australiangenomics.org.au/about us/our approach/ Accessed 19/12/2016. 113 About Us, [Online] Available from: http://www.qgha.org/about/ Accessed 19/12/2016. 114 Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance website (2016).

This model relies on a patient's genomic data being collected and stored securely to be drawn upon as needed. If a diagnostic test is prescribed by a clinician, diagnostic service providers are granted restricted access to a particular gene sequence or section relevant to the syndrome being considered. This prevents the inadvertent risk of making other genetic discoveries or findings for which informed consent has not being given, where results could have significant impacts on patients' lives. As well as providing a diagnosis, service providers may, upon receiving consent, indicate a patient's predisposition to certain conditions, allowing a clinician to prescribe preventative medical services focused on patient wellness. Genomics will also allow clinicians to prescribe tailored treatment plans that will best work for an individual based on their specific characteristics. Other possible services include examination and analysis of environmental data alongside genome sequencing to make phenotypic projections and pharmacogenomics analysis to understand personalised drug dosages for a patient. When effectively de identified, this data can be packaged for the development of new technologies.

Specifically, the study aims to assess the ability of low dose aspirin to prevent or delay the onset of age related illness such as cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke), dementia, depression and certain cancers and if the benefits outweigh the risks, such as bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke. As the largest primary prevention aspirin study ever undertaken in healthy older people (70+ years), the trial has over 19,100 participants across Australia and the US (87% from Australia, 13% from the US). The trial is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study, with participants taking a randomised placebo or low dose aspirin for an average of 5 years. In Australia, the trial is led by Monash University, with the first results expected to emerge in 2018. The ASPREE trial has created a valuable and rich dataset and biobank with a depth and breadth unparalleled in Australia. Although established primarily to study low dose aspirin, ASPREE has become an important vehicle to study many other aspects of the health of older Australians, with a number of sub studies investigating the effects of aspirin on specific diseases. 115 115 Aspree website (2015). About the Aspree AUSTRALIA'S GLOBAL POSITIONING Why Australia An equitable healthcare system - The provision of healthcare in Australia is among the best in the world, with high levels of baseline coverage and incentives to access private health insurance. This is one less variable that may inhibit the development of data based resources collected from patients. A 2016 analysis ranked Australia in the top five countries based on perceived readiness to realise the benefits of integration and connected care in the healthcare system. 116 Diverse culture, social economic stability, and unique location - Australia's population diversity when combined with excellent levels of baseline healthcare access, makes Australian patients a statistically interesting pool from which information can be collected to provide data sets needed for the development of preventative and precision MTP products. Also, compared to other countries, patients and healthcare professionals in Australia generally feel comfortable sharing their data; a recent survey shows that 91% of Australians would be willing to share their de identified medical data if it went towards research purposes. 117 Quality infrastructure and business environment - Australia has been an early investor in the infrastructure required to drive down the cost of obtaining various forms of complex health data. Using genome sequencing as an example, it is estimated that there are approximately 85 next generation sequencers in Australia. 118 The Garvan Institute's Genome.One is an example of a state oftheart Australian platform that can generate the high value data needed to explore this opportunity. A strong research community - Australia has demonstrated success in leading significant data analytics projects that draw on a variety of patient inputs. For example, the Australian eHealth Research Centre has successfully taken data from multiple sources and packaged it in ways found to be useful for the development of MTP products and services. 116 Institute for the Future (IFTF) (2016).

The ultimate buyers will include insurers and governments in search of solutions to change the profile of healthcare spending to one that increases overall wellness and enhances productivity. Consequently, these stakeholders should also be considered in the partnership process. Insurance companies may wish to leverage medical data services in the development of new products and services to help their customers understand disease profiles and the subsequent preventative measures that can be taken to increase wellness. This is an area that pro active patients are already showing an interest in. Similarly, insurers have a financial interest in understanding how to deliver precision healthcare, reducing the current trial and error prescription method, and more prosaically reducing Never Events associated with incorrect dosing, therapy contradictions or therapy timing. As genomics and other complex diagnostics become commonplace into the future, multi stakeholder Case study LifeCourse The Melbourne Children's LifeCourse Initiative aims to maximise the value of the extensive population and clinical studies performed at and in collaboration with the Melbourne Children's to inform better outcomes for children and adolescents across the continuum of care. LifeCourse brings together resources and data to aid new research questions that cannot be addressed using lone studies. LifeCourse includes over 20 separate population based longitudinal studies, spanning 0 35 years (including two intergenerational studies), involving over 70,000 participants, 1 million data points and over 250,000 aliquots of biological specimens across 10 tissue types. The initiative aims to lead the national integration of early data to create an unparalleled resource for informing practice and policy. The data can be used to inform best timing and targeting of interventions that prevent disease and disorder, enhance treatment and promote wellbeing. LifeCourse data is available for researchers, service providers, policy makers and industry from across the world to propose questions to be answered using the LifeCourse cohorts. 119 119 LifeCourse website, LifeCourse - The LifeCourse Initiative, [Online] Available from: http://lifecourse.melbournechildrens.com/ Accessed 19/12/2016. partnerships will be required to develop an integrated system that provides easy access to the platforms that will generate the data and insights needed to develop preventative and precision MTP solutions. Global companies such as Google, Apple, Samsung and IBM, driven by their investments into decision making tools in the health and medical space, will also be searching for well packaged and robust data sets needed for machine learning. The connection between the data and these companies can be developed by Australian based MTP service providers that meet health specific quality and regulatory requirements, and understand how to securely collect and package health data. Competitors Globally, coordinated national efforts are underway to understand the best way to integrate complex patient and cohort information into healthcare systems, as such, the Australian MTP sector faces significant competition for this opportunity. It is likely that countries with more advanced, digitally integrated health systems, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, will provide an environment conducive to the development of the products and services outlined. 119 LifeCourse website, LifeCourse - The Melbourne from: http://lifecourse.melbournechildrens.com/ Accessed 19/12/2016. 53Emerging markets, which under the right conditions should be buyers of the technology, have the potential to leapfrog Australia in the adoption of fully integrated digital health models and develop their own health data services. 120 Similarly, the patient inputs that make this opportunity viable in Australia face competition from other countries. The Precision Medicine Initiative in the US is an effort to build a national, data driven research enterprise with over one million volunteers to extend precision medicine to all diseases. 121 Opportunity threats Keeping up with or ahead of competitors is a necessity, with Australia facing the reality of being left behind if a concentrated effort is not put into pursuing information integration, and the business models that will underpin the exchange and application of this data. Failure to consider this means that MTP businesses will have little incentive to develop precision or preventative health solutions in Australia. Currently, access to new information generating technologies such as genome sequencing is limited to those willing to pay for it out of pocket. 122 Lagging reimbursement standards could present a threat to the significant collection and analysis of patient data. Similarly, Australia's slow adoption of electronic health records could threaten development of novel diagnostic and informatics products. Further, it is important that businesses maintain a social licence for the collection and use of patient data. Failure to build safeguards, transparency and effective management of risk for the use of data will result in loss of community trust and acceptance. 123 It is important that businesses maintain a social licence for the collection and use of patient data. 120 McKeering, D., Norton, C., Gulati A., (2016).

Data Availability and Use, Draft Report, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra. 4.4.3 PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE Perhaps the most important action required to realise this opportunity is collaboration, as SMEs, the research community, service provides, regulators and clinicians will be required to work together to develop a digitally connected and integrated MTP and health ecosystem. Service models must be considered in the context of clinical trials regulation, reinforcing Australia's position as an attractive destination to complete the clinical development of next generation precision and preventative MTP products. Australia's diagnostic and informatics products and services in the 2030s The Australian MTP sector has developed a new service industry that collects, de-identifies, packages and delivers data for the development of precision and preventative medical products and services. Australian clinicians have access to cutting edge precision medical products and services. Australian based services have been deployed into developing countries, helping improve the development of digitally enabled healthcare systems. Australia is known for its large cohort studies that have been used to create reliable and informative databases, accessible to MTP product developers, accelerating the production of preventative and precision products and services for patients. The Australian Government is committed to building a nationwide approach to medical data management through the Australian Government's Australian Digital Health Agency, which commenced operations on 1 July 2016. The Agency is tasked with improving health outcomes for Australians through the delivery of digital healthcare systems and the national digital health strategy for Australia. 120 McKeering, D., Norton, C., Gulati A., (2016).

The Government seeks to increase availability and use of data to boost innovation and competition in Australia. 124 Ecosystem changes A number of ecosystem challenges currently limit the implementation of patient data collection and distribution in Australia, including issues around ethics, privacy and data sharing, regulations and reimbursements. It is critical that MTP businesses consider a digital integration strategy, and develop shared industry data standards. Critical skills and infrastructure - In capturing this opportunity, key skills will need to be developed in the Australian medical workforce, including a deeper understanding of genomics and broader digital literacy. Enabling infrastructure includes the widespread national adoption of electronic health records and frameworks to allow industry to have access to de identified data. Industry development - Development of recognised standards in the short term is imperative, as in the absence of these robust standards, companies will adopt their own guidelines. Currently in Australia there are a number of initiatives that are investigating the integration of complex patient data into Australia's healthcare system, which will help establish the parameters for safe and efficient data handling. Outcomes - Successful development of this opportunity will see the industry evolve from one with limited data integration to a system with patient centric precision and preventative MTP products, serviced by a vibrant Australian industry. 124 Productivity Commission (2016). Data Availability and Use, Draft Report, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra. Case study Mission Massimo In 2010, Stephen and Sally Damiani utilised genomic sequencing to isolate the rare and complex disease that threatened the life of their son, Massimo. Massimo was one of the first 20 individuals in the world to have a clinical whole genome sequenced. After searching worldwide, the Damiani's found Ryan Taft (at the time a research scientist in the University of Queensland, currently Senior Director of scientific research at Illumina), who drove forward the complex project of aligning the three Damiani genomes to identify a unique variation in Massimo that might explain his symptoms. 125 By exploring imaging biobanks in the US and EU, nine children with similar symptoms were identified, and were subsequently shown to have mutations in the same gene; this led to the identification of a new disease known as Hypomyelination with Brain stem and Spinal cord involvement and Leg spasticity (HBSL), a subset of a group of genetic disorders termed Leukoencephalopathies. By understanding the mutation and how it causes the body to react, the Damiani family and their clinicians have been able to potentially slow the advancement of the disease in Massimo. Driven by this success and with significant knowledge behind them, the Damiani family has embarked on a research program to define a therapy that will halt progression of the disease. The program involves a team of international scientists, including members of the University of Queensland, University of New South Wales and Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. This case exemplifies the power of genomic data and the potential it has for rapid identification of rare diseases. In terms of developing MTP solutions, this case exemplifies early success in Australia regarding the process required to leverage medical imaging and genomic data for the identification of diseases that do not currently have an associated pharmaceutical therapy. 125 Kaminsky, L., Damiani, S., Damiani, S., (2015).

The computing resources and data storage required just to handle complex data will be enormous, and increase significantly when accessibility to the diagnostic platforms that generate the data is increased. For example, the data storage demands for a single genome is 30 times larger than the size of the genome itself, accounting for errors incurred during sequencing and preliminary analysis. 127 The information systems needed to effectively integrate health data from MTP ecosystem via novel service models also need to overcome a number of technical barriers, not least of which is cybersecurity and assurance of patient anonymity through the process. 127 Hayden, E.C., (2015).

However, businesses cannot achieve this in isolation and will require support from the entire ecosystem. This chapter discusses common change themes that appear across each opportunity, and suggested shortterm actions required to enable change. Actions have been separated into business actions (those which businesses in the MTP industry should proactively lead) and ecosystem actions (those to be led by industry bodies, research, education, investors and governments, in consultation with businesses). The industry growth centre, MTPConnect, has identified seven growth priorities that will underpin short and medium term ecosystem changes to maximise the sector's competitiveness and long term sustainability; short term sector sustainability is critical for capturing the longer term opportunities outlined in this Roadmap. Taking direct action in line with these priorities, MTPConnect have established a project fund program. In late 2016, 14 projects were supported covering everything from skills gaps to infrastructure development. Table 3 demonstrates the strong alignment between each MTPConnect growth priority and the four industry opportunities.5 Enabling sector change The growth opportunities discussed in this report indicate a bright future for the Australian MTP sector, however, the sector must act quickly or risk losing its place in the global market.

Sector growth necessitates a coordinated effort in connecting, securing, storing and standardising medical research and patient data to transform Australia's MTP sector. Improved infrastructure will facilitate the development, testing, and commercialisation of digitally enabled MTP solutions. Recognising the crucial need for improved digital health infrastructure, the Australian Government's Australian Digital Health Agency (the Agency) commenced operations in 2016, tasked with improving health outcomes through the delivery of digital healthcare systems and the national digital health strategy. 128 A key piece of digital health infrastructure that will have a profound effect on this industry is a national electronic health records system. The My Health Record system is a core component of the national digital health system, with over 4.2 million Australians registered for a My Health Record. 129 The My Health Record contain the following types of information: health summaries, event and discharge summaries, medication records, eReferrals and specialist letters. 130 Sector growth necessitates a coordinated effort in connecting, securing, storing and standardising medical research and patient data to transform Australia's MTP sector. 128 Australian Government, Australian Digital Health Agency website, About the Agency, [Online] Available from: https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/aboutthe agency Accessed 19/12/2016. 129 Australian Government, Australian Digital Health Agency (2016).

Discussion Paper. 130 Australian Government, Australian Digital Health Agency website, My Health Record system and Healthcare Identifiers (HI), [Online] Available health record system healthcare identifiers Accessed 19/12/2016.Importantly, infrastructure needs to be put into place around these electronic records to enable de identified data to be used to inform medical research, derive efficiency insights, and foster industry growth, in addition to improving patient care. This will require sector strategies that consider privacy preserving analytics, advanced cybersecurity solutions and best practice management of social licence in the collection and use of data. As patient data becomes available from varied sources, electronic health records will need to accommodate increasingly larger data sets, especially genomic data. As improved digital infrastructure is developed, digital literacy and specialised skills will become increasingly important to ensure the sector is prepared to adopt and realise benefits from emerging technologies. A number of Australian entities are investigating how to implement digital strategies required to leverage medical research and patient data for the development of digital MTP solutions, including Data61, the Australian e Health Research Centre, AusBiotech via the Digital Health Advisory Group, and the Murdoch Children's Research Institute via the National Digital Health Initiative.5.1 Digital infrastructure 128 Australian Government, Australian Digital Health Agency website, About the Agency, [Online] Available from: https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/aboutthe agency Accessed 19/12/2016. 129 Australian Government, Australian Digital Health Agency (2016).

Developments in personalised medical technology and digitally driven MTP solutions are at risk of being lost to countries with more agile systems. Modernisation in Australia's regulatory practices will facilitate competitive growth of opportunities outlined in this Roadmap, and catalyse the creation of ancillary services such as electronic health knowledge sharing and new digital applications. Sector consultations raised the proposition for an Australian based assessment of a new regulatory model based on emerging trends in the global financial technology industry. This trend involves creating a regulatory sandbox (see case study), a basic regulatory system that mirrors the essential features of the operational regulatory environment without the complexity, formality and cost. The development of a regulatory sandbox or similar reform of regulatory processes to address the complexity of regulatory approvals would serve to place the Australian MTP sector in a globally competitive position to exploit emerging opportunities, however, would obviously require limitations in scope. Tightly linked to international regulatory approval is access to global value chains and international markets; an important factor for the success of Australia's MTP sector. Increased global confidence in Australia's MTP solutions will be developed through continual demonstration of the safety, quality and agility of Australia's regulatory system, and its close alignment with the essential requirements of critical international regulatory bodies. Access to international markets will be driven by companies banding together to form collaborative cohorts and leveraging established Australian companies, or partnering and licensing with international firms. Either approach is strengthened by collaboration with complementary businesses, and by leveraging trade and brand initiatives already in place by organisations such as Austrade, AusBiotech and MTPConnect.5.2 Regulatory system and market access TABLE 5: BUSINESS AND ECOSYSTEM ACTIONS - REGULATORY SYSTEM AND MARKET ACCESS BUSINESS ACTIONS Regulatory intermediaries - engage consultants to help navigate the regulatory pathway if required. Build experienced teams - integrate staff with international regulatory know how early in the development process. International access - connect with industry bodies to develop an understanding of the international market requirements and how to effectively leverage existing programs. Collaborative research - utilise existing funding schemes to access basic research and early development (refer to Appendix A3).ECOSYSTEM ACTIONS Regulatory agility - address uncertainties regarding reimbursement of bespoke implants and bionics. Regulatory Sandbox - assess the feasibility of a Regulatory Sandbox for medical devices and digitally enabled MTP solutions. Enable collaboration with global companies - create incentives to encourage global companies to establish an Australian presence.

Position Australia as the preferred partner for emerging Asian markets. 63Case Study ASIC Regulatory sandbox In the financial technologies (FinTech) industry, a number of regulators globally are proposing to establish 'regulatory sandboxes' to help enable innovation, including the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Australia. 131 While there are significant differences between the FinTech and MTP sectors, there are numerous similarities; of particular relevance are the social expectations regarding customer/patient privacy which underpin cross sector goals concerning data security, integrity and interoperability. To enable innovation, the sandbox model provides a faster path to market for inventive companies (especially start ups) by allowing them to test and develop products in a restricted environment, lowering the risk of failure that can be caused by complex regulatory frameworks during the product development phase. Australia seeks to be a leader in FinTech and is currently building on existing initiatives from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to implement a limited industry wide licensing exemption to allow start ups to test certain financial services for six months, provided they comply with a limited range of requirements (the 'regulatory sandbox' exemption). 132 In the context of MTP solutions, the goal of a sandbox is to allow developers to test and optimise digitally driven products and services before embarking on the more complex, time consuming and expensive regulatory approvals process. It is recognised that this is an unrealistic model for pharmaceutical products where extensive safety studies must be completed prior to efficacy studies, but if structured correctly it may provide the correct framework to allow for rapid development cycles of solutions that are inherently safe, such as data capturing devices. Many of these types of technologies currently fall in a grey area for regulation and are sold direct to the consumer without any efficacy requirements; demonstrating how to efficiently move these products and services to a regulated environment could help establish Australia as a preferred development destination. 131 Gnirch, M., (2016).

The MTP sector relies on strong research skills across the STEMM fields, and draws upon skills from a variety of other disciplines, including business and commerce, law, nursing and industrial design. Future workforce planning and skilling will also need to consider the effects of digital technologies on the workforce, as well as skills for key service industries to the MTP sector, such as clinical trials, contract research organisations, and pre clinical services. MTPConnect has identified a number of skills gaps in the sector including: 133 Enabling disciplines such as bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, health economics, regulatory affairs, and data analytics. Advanced manufacturing specific to the MTP sector (reskilling and redeploy Australia's existing underutilised manufacturing workforce is an opportunity). Business acumen and commercialisation skills (particularly in researcher founded start ups). Developing, attracting and retaining STEMM research talent is critical to success in this sector, as it provides the ideas pipeline of inventive concepts that can be translated into valuable MTP solutions. Given the importance of researchers in the pipeline of the MTP sector, the decline in the number of full time researchers in Australia since 2012 has raised concerns over the erosion of Australia's health and medical research workforce. 134 Collaboration, both research toindustry and businesstobusiness, is recognised as an important factor for innovation, especially in the MTP sector where SMEs are often spun out from universities or other public sector research organisations. With Australia's level of research collaboration between research sector and industry amongst the lowest in the OECD, 135 collaboration is recognised as a key weakness of the Australian innovation system. 133 L.E.K.

Australia's health and medical research workforce: Expert people providing exceptional , Deloitte, Canberra. 135 Joint Select Committee on Trade and Investment Growth (2016). Inquiry into Australia's Future in Research and Innovation 2016, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra.A key cause is the lack of understanding that business and research have of each other; businesses lack understanding on how to effectively engage with researchers, and researchers lack business exposure and appreciation/understanding of industry timeframes and commercial imperatives. 136 Networking and industry clusters are two mechanisms that can help improve both culture and collaboration in the MTP industry. In combination with weak collaboration, Australia has historically lacked funding and investor interest for the translation of MTP solutions. Recent developments such as the $500 million Biomedical Translation Fund (BTF), the $200 million CSIRO Innovation Fund and the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) include success metrics designed to overcome this problem. 137 138 139 In combination with weak collaboration, Australia has historically lacked funding and investor interest for the translation of MTP solutions. In addition, there is a responsibility for the MTP community to educate and show the value to the Australian investment community of investment in MTP product and service development. Australia is home to one of the largest stock markets in the world by market capitalisation, however there is poor representation of MTP companies in the ASX200; excluding CSL, less than 2% is derived from MTP businesses. 140 The innovation and translation funds must be complemented by investor activity to see real growth in the sector. There has been as increase in the number of incubators and investors, with companies such as Bluechilli or Cicada Innovations providing access to funding as well as product development expertise, and advice and support, to build a sustainable business. These incubators offer increased access to funding for the sector. 136 NSW Business Chamber (2014). Industry Research Collaboration - Discussion Paper, North Sydney. 137 Australian Government (2016).

Navigating long term change requires MTP businesses to constantly assess the way they run their businesses - ensuring that scarce resources are appropriately allocated and that business decisions are underpinned with strong underlying market and technology assumptions.5.4 Strategic planning This roadmap can be used as a tool to inform strategic decision making within MTP businesses. Global megatrends, opportunities for growth, and enabling science, technology and business changes can be tailored for specific business needs using the Explore, Choose and Plan steps of the framework depicted in Figure 24. Scenario planning and input for the Create step have been excluded from this report as application is highly company specific, however additional information can be found in CSIRO's Australia 2030 report.

Building on these enabling sector changes, the four long term growth opportunities highlighted in this report aim to improve Australia's competitiveness within the global MTP sector. The road forward to capitalising on these opportunities and realising industry growth begins with the common change themes discussed in this chapter. The following table summarises the key themes to help enable MTP sector change.6 The road forward TABLE 7: ENABLING CHANGES SUMMARY Digital infrastructureRegulatory system and market accessSector structure, skills and culture BUSINESS ACTIONS Digital strategy - assess business plans for inclusion of a digital strategy and consider data integration with the MTP ecosystem.

Workforce planning - to ensure the skills required to efficiently translate MTP technology are being nurtured, and that they are in line with global demands. Industry meets academia - incentivise research institutes to employ a higher proportion of experienced industry professionals and provide mentorship programs.A number of changes are needed to help transform Australia's MTP sector to achieve the vision for the future and pursue the opportunites for sector growth. 70 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaTABLE 8: ENABLING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY - FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES SUMMARYDevelopments in enabling science and technology will be pivotal to growth in this sector. Perhaps more than any sector, novel solutions to global MTP demands are underpinned by convergence of disparate fields of science and technology. Convergence of technologies through innovative combinations will transform the sector and create new challenges for researchers, businesses and regulators. The key themes of these enabling technologies across the four growth opportunities are summarised in Table 8. Convergence of technologies through innovative combinations will transform the sector and create new challenges for researchers, businesses and regulators.

These advantages and related disadvantages are detailed below. A.1.1 STRONG INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION FOR QUALITY Australia has built a strong international reputation for its stringent regulatory systems, quality management and standards, helping to differentiate Australian research, services and manufactured products in a global marketplace. Globally, Australia was rated as the fourth most reputable country in the Reputation Institute's 2016 rankings, behind Sweden, Canada and Switzerland. 141 In Australia, companies are required to gain approval from the TGA to manufacture and sell pharmaceutical agents and must adhere to Good Manufacturing Practice among other quality assurance frameworks. This has built a reputation for high quality, clean and safe production processes resulting in growing demand from Asia for Australian manufactured products, including pharmaceuticals. 142 Related disadvantage Small market and population - While the output from Australia is highly rated, it is limited in quantity. In a sector as tightly regulated as MTP, any dip in the quality of output will rapidly harm the reputation of all Australian outputs. Australian quality standards across all industries within the sector must be upheld to the highest standards. 141 Reputation Institute (2016). 2016 Country RepTrak - the most reputable countries in the world. 142 Victorian Government, Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport & Resources (2016). Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals Sector Strategy , State of Victoria.A.1.2 DIVERSE CULTURE, SOCIAL-ECONOMIC STABILITY, AND UNIQUE LOCATION Australia's social economic stability and resilience, demonstrated by 25 years of uninterrupted annual growth, together with its well regulated business environments and comparatively high access to resources provides beneficial supply chain security and a safe, low risk environment for investment. 143 Australia's high living standards, culture, climate and lifestyle act as significant drawcards in attracting skilled people to Australia, with Melbourne named as the most liveable location in a 2015 survey of 140 global cities. 144 With 28.2% of Australia's resident population born overseas, 145 Australia's MTP sector has access to a predominantly English speaking, ethnically diverse population - a valuable advantage for Australian clinical trials and the development of health and medical data sets. Similarly, the large proportion of Australian residents that have emigrated from Asia provides cultural familiarity for Australian market access into this region, adding to Australia's proximity advantage. The MTP sector can uniquely leverage Australia's proximity to Asia to form partnerships with global companies. As many companies investigate market access into the region, Australia's location and its many existing cultural, business and academic links make it a great base and partner for development activities. Related disadvantages Complex federated model - Australia's federated approach leads to different state policies and inter state transactions that can promote competitive rather than collaborative behaviours, resulting in duplication of effort and spending. Low global competitiveness - Australia's highly stable environment may have cumulated in an inability to be agile, leading to uncompetitive international ranks for factors such as business sophistication, innovation, goods and labour market efficiency. 146 143 Australian Trade Commission (2016).

The Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017, World Economic Forum, Geneva. 74 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaA.1.3 AN EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Australia's stability has led to high levels of healthcare accessibility for citizens through a well developed national healthcare system (Medicare), providing high levels of baseline care. Private health insurance remains fair and ethical due to the guidelines established by the Private Healthcare Insurance Act, 147 resulting in 55% of Australian's covered by private insurance in 2012 13.148 Access to prescription medicine is subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The PBS decides which products will be reimbursed to the public. This structure enables Australia's healthcare system to perform well on a global scale, ranked as the 6 th most efficient healthcare system internationally in 2014 (based on life expectancy and cost of health care), above the UK, Canada and the US, with average life expectancy exceeding the OECD average by two years. 149 150 Much like Australia's broader stability, this helps to remove a variable when conducting clinical trials or collecting population data. Related disadvantages Complex federated model - Australia's state based healthcare approach makes it difficult to create a cohesive national based cost containment strategy and integrated healthcare models. Disperse rural and remote populations - health statistics for Australia's remote and rural populations are less impressive than for urban dwellers, due in part to limited access to healthcare infrastructure. While this is an undesirable situation, these populations provide an ideal test bed for remote MTP solutions. 147 Australian Government (2007).

An assessment of Australia's publication output indicates that Australian research ranks amongst the top 10 in the world for basic research in the following health and medical areas: 157 Human movement and sports science Ophthalmology and optometry Public health and health services Evolutionary biology Psychology Physiology Cognitive science Genetics Clinical sciences Medical microbiology Neurosciences Paediatrics and reproductive medicine Medical physiology Microbiology Medical biochemistry and metabolomics Cardiovascular medicine and haematology Immunology Nutrition and dietetics Oncology and carcinogenesis 156 Thomson Reuters (2015). Australian Research & Innovation, A whitepaper . 157 Custom analysis from InCites Analytics by Thomson Reuters (2016). Australia has demonstrated success across a number of research fields. Related disadvantages Low rates of collaboration and translation of research - Australia's industry is often disconnected, leading to low levels of collaboration between research organisations and industry. 158 This manifests itself in Australia's poor ability to translate world class research into innovative commercial outcomes despite its strong research community, with developing products often obtaining funding from international investors, resulting in lost value from the Australian sector. This is exacerbated by limited access to and interest from the Australian investment community. Loss of key talent - The total NHMRC workforce has decreased 16% over the three years to 2016, 159 and NHMRC success rates for medical research grants are declining, with only 13.73% of 2015 grant applications successful in getting funding. 160 This is creating career uncertainty that leads to Australian researchers leaving the research field or leaving Australia to seek a stable future. 161 158 Australian Government, Department of Education, Department of Industry (2014).

Australia is recognised globally for its highly educated workforce, which has been a traditional source of advantage to the sector. Australian tertiary level education rates have grown each year since 2001 and are now well above the OECD average. 162 In the global landscape, Australia has competitive strengths in the access to and quality of its education system, ranked 9 th globally for higher education and training. 163 As Australia moves to a knowledge driven economy and as new technological advancements are realised in the MTP sector, jobs will change, becoming reliant on highly skilled employees with a significant focus on digital literacy. 162 OECD (2016). Education at a Glance 2016: OECD Indicators , OECD Publishing, Paris. 163 Schwab, K., (2016). The Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017, World Economic Forum, Geneva.Related disadvantages Changing skills requirements - In the healthcare system and the MTP industry, changing requirements for workforce skills will place pressure on tertiary education institutions into the future. For example, Australia's aged care system is experiencing rapid growth due to an ageing population, with demand for skilled aged care staff expected to quadruple by 2050. 165 Specialist skills shortages - a 2012 study identified that Australia will face a shortage of 3,800 GPs, 366 radiologists, 142 obstetricians and gynaecologists, and 182 ophthalmologists by 2025, 166 which would reduce Australia's capacity to develop clinically driven MTP solutions and conduct clinical trials. Lack of sector specific management skills - Professionals with the appropriate mix of commercial acumen and MTP product development experience are lacking in Australia, resulting in a shortfall of local candidates with the know how to successfully create new ventures. Over half of the CEOs from the top 200 companies in the Australian Securities Exchange were born overseas. 167 While this indicates that there may be a lack of talent in Australia, it also emphasises the comparative advantage of Australia being an attractive destination based on lifestyle and stability. Fewer researchers in businesses - Compared to other similarly developed countries, Australia has fewer PhDs working in industry, with less than one in three Australian researchers working in private industry - the OECD average is 60%. 168 This leads to a lack of researchers with important business skills. Lagging STEMM skills pipeline - the pipeline of STEMM skills into the national workforce is low compared to similar economies, with a declining rate of STEMM related course completions. 169 This lowers the availability of suitably skilled workforce for the MTP sector. 165 Arico, S., & Srinivasan, V ., (2014).

Progressing STEM Skills in Australia. 77A.1.6 REPUTABLE NATIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY Australia's National Regulatory Authority (NRA), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is responsible for regulation of all therapeutic goods that are supplied in Australia, including medical devices and medicines. The TGA plays a critical role in protecting the Australian community by managing the registration of products for which therapeutic claims are made on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). The TGA has an excellent reputation both internationally and domestically and is widely respected for its work in ensuring the availability of high quality, safe and efficacious therapeutic products on the Australian market. Compared to NRAs in other countries, the TGA performs well in its regulation of medicines, however, performance in the regulation of devices is less notable, lacking timeliness and predictability. 170 Recognised as a critical enabler for Australian clinical trials, the TGA offers a comparatively simple process for trial commencement which reduces the regulatory burden on clinical trial sponsors (see section A.1.7). 171 Related disadvantages Regulatory inefficiency - a 2015 independent review of medicines and medical device regulation in Australia provided recommendations to improve the TGA, aiming to remove or streamline areas of unnecessary, duplicative or ineffective regulation, without undermining the safety or quality of therapeutic goods available in Australia. 172 Of the Review's 58 recommendations, 56 are supported by the Government and will be implemented in a staged approach over the next four years, supported by a $20 million reform fund. As reforms are implemented, Australia will stabilise its place a global leader for the development of regulatory efficiency. 173 170 Sansom L., et al (2015).

A.1.7 QUALITY CLINICAL TRIALS Australia has a strong ability to complete high quality clinical trials across numerous therapeutic areas (Figure 25), with particular strengths in oncology and cardiovascular disorders. Australia also has a strong and growing service industry for clinical trials with reputable contract research organisations helping differentiate Australia as a global destination for early stage trials. Australia's reputation for these early stage clinical trials is based on comparably high cost efficiency, regulatory speed, flexibility and quality, 174 as well as being the home to world leading key opinion leaders. As addressed in Section A.1.2, Australia also has comparative advantages in its access to an ethnically diverse, English speaking patient population; this is leveraged by operating many single site trials using healthy and diverse volunteers, creating a key advantage. Seasonal differences between the Northern and Southern hemisphere allow trials dependent on seasonal factors to continue in Australia. Australia is generally recognised as an expensive destination for trials, however this is balanced by other factors including data quality, timeliness of start up and capacity to recruit. 175 However, while expensive compared to low cost economies - Australia is 28% cheaper before tax incentives and 60% cheaper after R&D tax incentives compared to US trials. 176 Australia also has comparative advantages in its access to an ethnically diverse, English speaking patient population. 174 Frost & Sullivan (2016).

Australia: Preferred Destination for Early Phase Clinical Trials. 78 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaRelated disadvantages Slow start up times for multi site trials - governance and ethics approvals specific to each site can be a lengthy and inconsistent process. Reviews show this requires multiple ethics submissions without a consistent framework, difficulties sourcing a lead site and in the worst case the exclusion of a site from the trial. 179 Federated model - many clinical trials will involve sites across different Australian cities, and will navigate state based hospital frameworks. On an international scale, attracting partners requires seamless collaboration. Internal complexities create unnecessary inefficiencies that hinder collaboration. In an effort to decrease clinical trial complexities, the Australian Government has recently invested $20 million in the improvement of the clinical trial environment, including multi site trials. 179 Health Outcomes International (2015). Australian Government Department of Health Analysis of recently conducted clinical trials, Australian Government, Department of Health.Australia's regulatory system has also been recognised as a key international drawcard for clinical trials, allowing flexibility without compromising quality. Clinical trials in Australia operate through either the Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) or Clinical Trial Exemption (CTX) schemes. The CTX scheme is an approval process through the TGA, while the CTN scheme designates responsibility for trial approval to Human Research Ethics Committees (HREC), with the TGA simply notified. While the TGA has the authority to audit the management of a clinical trial, the CTN process eliminates duplications and avoids costly preparation of extensive regulatory applications, allowing clinical research to start much sooner, saving time and money. 177 178 177 Frost & Sullivan (2016).

Australian IP law is designed to encourage innovation and protect companies that develop original IP, providing them with a competitive advantage. The pharmaceutical sector benefits from other specific IP arrangements such as an extension of term, where further to the 20 year term applying to the majority of patents, pharmaceutical patents can qualify for an additional five years of protection. Related disadvantages Patents granted too readily - While Australia's system is comparatively strong, a key issue is that Australia's patent system often grants exclusivity too easily, resulting in a proliferation of low quality patents which can reduce follow on innovations. 182 Australia can gain a comparative advantage by aligning its IP systems with areas of strategic importance, and by continuing to implement and review the IP Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Act. 181 Schwab, K., (2016).

Intellectual Property Arrangements, Inquiry Report No. 78 , Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra.A.1.9 QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Australia has a transparent and well regulated business environment. Businesses are incentivised to engage in Australian research and development through R&D tax incentives; these incentives are currently under review. 183 In a broader context, Australia has held AAA sovereign debt rating for over a decade and is one of the 20 largest stock exchanges in the world, which indicates a culturally pragmatic approach to economics that should be leveraged by the MTP sector. 184 185 Australia's research community and MTP industry is supported by internationally competitive scientific facilities, ranked 12 th in the world for quality. 186 Research clusters, such as the Parkville precinct in Melbourne, encourage and enable development of the MTP sector. Initiatives under the Australian Government's National Innovation and Science Agenda are mapping the long term research infrastructure needs for Australia, ensuring Australia's research community will be continually advantaged through access to advanced infrastructure that assist in the translation of inventive MTP solutions. The 2016 National Research Infrastructure Roadmap (draft) identifies nine focus areas, a number of which align with the needs of the MTP sector, including: digital data and eResearch platforms; characterisation; advanced fabrication and manufacturing; biosecurity; complex biology; and therapeutic development. 187 183 Ferris, B., Finkel, A., Fraser, J., (2016).

Draft 2016 National Research Infrastructure Roadmap, Canberra. 80 Medical Technologies and Pharmaceuticals | A Roadmap for unlocking future growth opportunities for AustraliaRelated disadvantages Lagging digital infrastructure -Australia lags behind global leaders such as Finland and Singapore in its overall environment for digital technology. 188 Progress to introduce national electronic health records has been slow 189 and digital infrastructure has significant differences between rural and urban areas, with some Australian communities digitally excluded and a large number of small, rural hospitals with no or minimal investment in IT. Australia's global ranking for internet speed (average peak connection speed) dropped from 30th to 56th between September 2013 and July 2016. 190 191 Funding gaps - traditionally, there has been a lack of investor driven funding to bridge the gap between discovery research and clinical development, which results in poor translation of ideas to market (lack of incentives and funding for start ups). Initiatives such as the new Biomedical Translation Fund aim to address this.192 Assessment of ASX200 businesses show that by market capitalisation 5.4% relates to MTP, and removing CSL reduces this to less than 2%. 193 Complex federated model - competition between state based research groups often leads to duplication of research infrastructure that is not fully utilised, with limited coordination between funding bodies (national grant systems, philanthropic, state governments). Comparatively high corporate tax rate - countries such as Ireland and Singapore offer more attractive tax structures for large companies, which makes it financially disadvantageous for companies to expand operations in Australia. 188 Baller, S., Dutta, S., Lanvin, B., (2016).
