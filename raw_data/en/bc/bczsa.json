[Research shows](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/diet-gut-microbes-immunity) that our gut microbiome \u2014 or the trillions of microorganisms that live in the intestinal tract \u2014 is directly linked to immune health. Here are four healthy, nutritionist-approved recipes to strengthen your immune system this winter: 1. Haitian soup joumou There's truth behind the saying: the rainbow.\" [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34239993/) have found that phytonutrients, which are minimally processed \u2014 and often colorful \u2014 plant foods, can support proper immune balance and function. Maya Feller, a dietitian and author of the forthcoming book [\"Eating From Our Roots,\"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678507/eating-from-our-roots-by-maya-feller-ms-rd-cdn/) is a fan of [soup joumou](https://mayafellernutrition.com/soup-joumou/). Native to Haitian cuisine, this dish is often made with squash, beef and assorted vegetables. \"Not only is it representative of my culture and heritage, it's also rich in phytonutrients and fiber,\" says Feller, whose approach to nutrition is to make food more inclusive and reflective of the diverse world we live in. Ingredients For the soup: - 1 pound boneless beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes - 1/2 cup [Epis seasoning](http://haitiancooking.com/recipe/haitian-epis/) - 3/4 cup lime juice - 3/4 cup olive oil - 1 onion, diced - 3 garlic cloves, minced - 3 celery ribs, diced - 2 scallions, diced - 1 bunch parsley, chopped - 1 shallot, chopped - 2 tomatoes, roughly chopped - 8 cups low-sodium chicken broth - 1 winter squash, peeled and cut into 3-inch cubes - 5 medium potato, roughly chopped - 5 carrots, roughly chopped - 1 habanero pepper For the dumplings: - 1 1/2 cups [Einkorn](https://www.einkorn.com/)flour - 1/4 teaspoon baking powder - 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil - Pinch of flakey salt - 1/8 teaspoon fresh black pepper - Ripe avocado, for garnish Steps - Marinate the beef in seasoning and lime juice overnight. - Combine onions, garlic, celery, scallion, parsley and shallots into a large pot.

Cook for another 15 to 20 minutes. - To serve, spoon a heaping portion into a bowl and top with some avocado. 2. Vietnamese slow-cooked pho Nutritionist and chef Tessa Nguyen's dishes are inspired by ingredients that \"have been fixtures around the table in many cultures and for many centuries,\" such as star anise, cloves, Sichuan pepper and ginger. Her go-to dish for immune support is a batch of [slow-cooked pho](https://thetessanguyen.com/slow-cooker-pho/). \"It's full of nourishing ingredients that fulfill the body's needs any time of year, but especially during the colder months.\" Nguyen's recipe is filled with ingredients that are beneficial for immune health, like fresh herbs, vegetables and meat protein. Ingredients For the broth: - 2 pounds of beef - 1 1/2 teaspoons five spice powder - 1 tablespoon fish sauce (substitute with soy sauce if you have a fish allergy) - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1 bunch of green onions, chopped - Enough water to fill up your slow cooker after adding ingredients above For the noodles and toppings: - 1 cup rice noodles - Shredded beef from pho broth - Toppings: chopped cilantro, Thai basil leaves, chopped green onions, thinly sliced white onions, bean sprouts, sliced jalape\u00f1os, lime wedges, sriracha, hoisin sauce Steps - In a slow cooker, combine all broth ingredients and set to low heat.

Fragrant cauliflower, turmeric and ginger soup Hazel Wallace, a nutritionist and founder of [The Food Medic](https://thefoodmedic.co.uk/), recommends getting a balance of nutrients from anti-inflammatory foods like chickpeas and lentils, nuts and seeds, olive oil, fish and herbs and spices. Her [cauliflower soup recipe](https://thefoodmedic.co.uk/2022/01/cauliflower-turmeric-and-ginger-soup/) contains turmeric and ginger, both of which have anti-inflammatory properties. \"It's also incredibly warming and nourishing for the fall, or whenever you're feeling under the weather,\" she says.

Cook for five minutes until they are translucent. - Transfer the onions into a blender, along with the turmeric, ginger, garlic, vegetable stock, soy sauce and a pinch of salt.
