She specializes in Neuromodulation Technique, a kind of energy healing where she listens to the body's nervous system, and then modulates a change in the body to promote healing. Q: When it comes to traditional medicine, would you say that you should only do alternative medicine, or that some traditional medicine is ok, or are there some things that you won't even look at because it isn't your field of expertise? A: Allopathic medicine has its uses. if someone broke their bone, go to the emergency room! But if someone has diabetes, heart disease, allergies, I would say, you take a pill, or you put on a cream, it's not going to get at the real symptom. A lot of times there is emotion stuff too. Emotions do affect the physical body. If people don't feel their emotions, that is going to come out later in your physical body. Q: Would you say in some cases that it's better to supplement with some of the things that you do, as well as traditional medicine if needed? A: I've helped people with post surgery. We're giving an instruction to bring awareness so that the body can heal, and I think it happens faster. The people I've done post surgery, one of the things I helped them to do was help get anesthesia get out of them faster and to help with infections like keep the immune system on high alert for infections and they've done really well. It's an additive. If someone breaks their bone, then yeah go get it set but then you can't do anything but wait for it to heal. So, why not make it go faster? Q: Have you ever had anyone come to you with a very serious disease like, say, cancer? A: Yes. Q: How did you help treat them? A: The NMT protocol has clinical pathways. We have one that is for cancer cells that helps the body identify them to help get them out of the body. Sometimes a group of cancer cells will create signals to grow blood vessels and nerves like it's a new piece of the body. There are ways to stop that from happening. I don't prefer to work with people with cancer because in my experience they are very fearful, and I think that gets in the way of the healing process. The person has to be open and willing to do a shift. I'm working together with them to create a shift. I don't heal or cure them, the body heals itself. I'm just giving the instruction to do that. "}
