Some argue that evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine is a contradiction in terms1, and complementary and alternative therapies are inherently incompatible with evidence-based medicine2. Others claim that CAM can be considered evidence-based if the supporting research adheres to the same rigorous and standardized methods as conventional medicine3. Nevertheless patients and consumers continue to use and seek out information about CAM modalities4-6, while facing an information landscape that plagued by limited empirical research that is often misleading or of low quality7,8. As such, to best serve patients and clients, it is critically important for practitioners to understand the relationship between CAM and conventional medicine, the methodological issues that CAM research faces, and how to evaluate the potential value and pitfalls of CAM therapies. The [Critical Appraisal Resources](https://guides.nyu.edu/cam/critical-appraisa) found on this guide will offer general information and tools about critically appraising health evidence, but also consider exploring the resources below, which specifically focus on the conundrums, controversies and philosophies surrounding evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine.
