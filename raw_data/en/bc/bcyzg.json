At St George's, you'll be welcomed by a multicultural student and staff body of different ages, ethnicities, nationalities and backgrounds, all with one thing in common - an interest in science, healthcare and medicine. Students frequently tell us they greatly appreciate the diversity of our student and staff body, as well as the patients who access healthcare services in the borough of Tooting. We offer a full range of academic support and student services across all institutes, departments and faculties, some of which are listed below. We take pride in offering a transformative educational experience underpinned by cooperation and collaboration between staff and students. Our innovative Student-Staff Partnership Grants (SSPGs), for example, provide funding for small projects led jointly by students and staff, which included the co-creation by one of our students of an art exhibition inspired by the Museum of Human Disease collection. Personal tutor On arrival, you will be allocated a personal tutor - someone with whom you can have regular contact, who you ask questions and discuss problems with, both academic and personal. The main purpose of a personal tutor is to monitor your progress, pick up and help you resolve any problems, whether academic or welfare related. Even if they don't have the answer they will point you in the right direction towards the best people to deal with specific problems. Induction programme Within your first week at St George's, you'll take part in an [induction programme](https://www.sgul.ac.uk/study/get-started) to help with your orientation and introduce you to various study skills, including interprofessional learning and use of the Dissecting Room. Additional sessions provide advice and guidance about the Registry, Students' Union, personal tutor system, safety, occupational health and sexual health awareness. Academic staff support You'll have access to your lecturers, usually by arrangement via email. Mums and Dads scheme 'Mums and Dads' is a buddy scheme organised by the Students' Union. Every fresher (first year student) has the choice of being assigned a 'parent' from the year above in their respective course. The returning student then acts as a 'go to' for advice about courses and university life, providing an additional support system during your first year, both academically and socially. They have been in your position and know the struggles of starting university; they also know all of the best pubs, clubs, restaurants, gyms and will help introduce you to your new St George's family. Student Life Centre Our Student Centre team can help you with almost any aspect of student life: finances, accommodation, exams and assessment, academic procedures, admissions, international queries, careers, disability and wellbeing, even finding your way around - whatever it takes to make you feel at home. Careers service Our careers service works to support current students and recent graduates to find and maintain a rewarding and successful career. As well as general workshops on topics such as writing a CV and developing interview skills, the service works with the academic lead for Biomedical Science employability to ensure there are careers activities specific to your programmes and future profession. You will also be able to book a one-to-one appointment with a careers consultant to discuss all aspects of careers and employability. This might include investigating options and making career decisions, gaining advice and guidance on where to look for jobs, CV and application checking, or booking in for a practice interview. "}
