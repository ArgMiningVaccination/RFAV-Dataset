Crystal healing is a [pseudo-scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine) technique that employs stones and [crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal). Some claim that the stones have healing powers, although there is no scientific basis for this claim. The practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body, often corresponding to [chakras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra); or else the practitioner places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy. You don't have to believe in the power of crystals to reap their benefits. It's all about inspiring balance and the highest awareness of yourself and that includes looking at things a little differently. Scrying Shannon is certified in Scrying through an accredited school. Scrying, also known by the names of hydromancy, crystal gazing and oculomancy, is the ancient art of revelation. The word \"scrying\" actually comes from the Old English word descry which means \"to make out dimly\" or \"to reveal.\" Therefore, scrying is about revealing the unseen through the use of our in-born second sight. Second sight is our capacity to see things that can't usually be perceived through our five senses. Traditionally, scrying has been portrayed through the popular image of the psychic gazing over her crystal ball. But scrying, like all esoteric practices, is not about \"seeing the future.\" The future can't be seen, it can only be speculated based on present moment information. Usually, scrying is performed with the use of a reflective surface, such as a mirror, water or crystal globe. However, there are many other forms. Scrying helps us to get in touch with our unconscious minds, therefore, scrying can be used as a powerful form of self-understanding and psychoanalysis. If you're struggling to find direction, meaning or purpose in life, scrying could be a wonderful way to get in touch with your core needs, dreams and goals.
