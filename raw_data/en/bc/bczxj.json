[Homeopathy](https://www.westonaprice.org/podcast/covid-homeopathy-for-prevention-and-detox-post-shot/) addresses the vital force, not a condition or disease. It supports the innate healing ability of the individual. Since the experimental mRNA and vector DNA gene therapy injections\u2014sold to an unsuspecting public as \"vaccines\"\u2014were unleashed onto humanity in December 2020, record numbers of adverse events from the injections have been reported in numerous databases. Homeopaths around the world are now increasingly being asked to assist affected individuals. This article addresses three questions: - What data are available on injuries and deaths from Covid injections? - What kinds of symptoms have been reported from the shots, and what concerns do scientists and doctors have? - Which homeopathic remedies may be helpful to assist affected individuals with immediate, intermediate and potential long-term adverse events following injection? Adverse Event Data From Covid-19 Vaccinations The U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the passive surveillance system co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As compiled by Children's Health Defense in The Defender, from December 14, 2020 to February 18, 2022, VAERS data showed over 1.1 million reported adverse events (1,134,984) across all age groups following Covid vaccines.1 Over one hundred ninety-six thousand\u2014about 17 percent\u2014of the reported injuries were classified as \"serious,\" including over twenty-four thousand deaths. (The Defender summarizes the weekly releases of VAERS data every Friday.) VAERS includes both U.S. reports and some foreign reports sent to U.S. vaccine manufacturers by foreign subsidiaries.2 With foreign reports excluded, domestic adverse events exceeded seven hundred sixty-seven thousand through February 18\u2014over seventy-three thousand of them rated as \"serious\"\u2014including over eleven thousand one hundred deaths.1 The February 18 VAERS data showed, for all age groups combined, that many of the deaths and injuries were cardiac-related, with over sixteen hundred reported myocardial infarctions and over four thousand reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. Almost one in five deaths (19 percent) were due to a cardiac disorder. In addition, the injured reported well over thirteen thousand blood clotting disorders. Other widely reported conditions following Covid injections include Bell's palsy (over thirty-five hundred reports), life-threatening or fatal anaphylaxis (over twenty-three hundred) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (eight hundred fifty). Although the average age of death was about seventy-two, VAERS also reveals deaths in children and adolescents, including (again, as of February 18) four reported deaths (and over eighty-five hundred adverse events) in children ages five through eleven, and thirty-nine reported deaths (and nearly thirty thousand injuries) in teens ages twelve through seventeen. Sadly, adverse event reports among pregnant women numbered well over five thousand, including over sixteen hundred miscarriages or premature births.1 To put these numbers into perspective, VAERS has, in a little over a year, received more reports of injuries and deaths after Covid shots than the system accumulated in the previous thirty years for all other vaccines combined\u2014 including twice as many reported deaths.3 Moreover, a three-year, U.S. government-funded review by Harvard of data from seven hundred fifteen thousand patients found that \"fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.\"4 This could mean that a hundredfold more adverse vaccine events could be occurring than are reported to VAERS. The CDC has nonetheless refused to mandate, automate or otherwise improve VAERS reporting.5,6 In Australia, the Database of Adverse Event Notification (DAEN) collects information about adverse events related to both medicines and vaccines.7 According to the analysis and expert testimony of statistician Lisa Mitchell, DAEN received\u2014for calendar year 2021 (Jan. 1 through Dec. 31)\u2014reports of over one hundred thousand adverse events (100,180) following Covid mRNA injections, including seven hundred thirty-three deaths.8 Mitchell writes, \"The number of adverse events reported to this database regarding non-Covid vaccines from Jan 1, 1971 to Dec of 2021, a time span of 50 years, were 19,330 in total with 59 reported deaths. This makes Covid vaccines 36 times more lethal than conventional vaccines.\" As in the U.S., top categories of adverse events included neurological and cardiovascular disorders as well as \"injection site reactions.\" Insurance Data of Vaccine-related Injuries Are there other\u2014and potentially far more accurate\u2014databases? Indeed, insurance databases are beginning to document a veritable explosion of vaccine-related injuries. In early January, for example, The Defender and other news outlets reported a \"bombshell statistic\" shared by an Indiana insurance industry CEO executive during an end-of-year virtual news conference.9 The executive disclosed a \"stunning\" 40 percent increased death rate among working-age adults (ages eighteen through sixty-four) compared to pre-pandemic levels. Rating the extraordinarily high death rate as \"the highest we have seen in the history of this business,\" he added that the trend is \"consistent across every player in that business.\" He also described a major uptick in both short- and long-term disability claims. The following month, a German health insurance company made waves when it hypothesized significant underreporting and underrecording of Covid vaccine injuries, suggesting that vaccine-related adverse events are at least ten times more common than the numbers put forth by Germany's federal health agency.10 The company described a \"significant alarm signal\" emerging from its data on nearly eleven million insured people, and declared that \"a risk to human life cannot be ruled out.\" Military Data of Vaccine-related Injuries The U.S. Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED) is also revealing explosive findings. The military health records in DMED supply medical codes for medical issues faced by the military. On January 24, 2022, U.S. Senator Ron Johnson held a panel discussion, titled \"COVID-19: A Second Opinion,\"11 at which Ohio attorney Tom Renz shared whistleblower information about data from DMED (see Table 1), showing radical increases in health conditions of all types in 2021\u2014following the rollout of mandated Covid injections for military personnel\u2014compared to the average for the previous five years (2016-2020).12 The whistleblowers described \"jumps by factors of hundreds to thousands of percent\" in cancers as well as neurological, cardiovascular and reproductive disorders.13,14 Reportedly, the Department of Defense (DOD) panicked about the leak of this information, and it appears that the BBC's \"Trusted News Initiative\" (a partnership with organizations such as Google and the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post) and various \"fact-check\" organizations are now attempting to manipulate the DMED numbers from previous years to cover up the truth. Attorney Renz says, \"To believe these brand-new [that is, manipulated] DOD numbers you have to believe that the DOD under-reported all cases on this military database by around 20 million per year, for 5 years. They, the DOD, are now claiming that they have been underreporting cases by 1000% for 5 years.\"13 Homeopathic Remedies: Immediate Reactions to Covid Vaccine Reactions following receipt of Covid mRNA and vector DNA injections can be broadly classified as either immediate (happening within minutes to hours after the shot), intermediate (onset usually within a few days or weeks) and/or long-term. The latter are beginning to emerge, but their full scope may not be known until years from now. Homeopathic practitioners have used a number of homeopathic remedies to mitigate both short-term and longer-term adverse effects of the Covid injections, including remedies prepared from the various shots. The latter remedies are carried by specialized homeopathic pharmacies (such as the Alchemists Apothecary). However, please do not inquire directly with the pharmacy, as the general public cannot order these remedies directly. Instead, contact your professional homeopath or naturopathic doctor to order them for you. The potencies reported as most often helpful, either before or after the injections, are 30C and 200C. If adverse reactions occur, some practitioners like to use higher potencies as well. Immediate reactions such as tenderness and swelling at the injection site and arm pain are some of the most commonly reported symptoms after the shots. In the UK, these represent more than one in ten reported adverse reactions submitted to the \"Yellow Card\" system.15 Apis mellifica, a remedy made from bee venom, may be helpful for local tenderness and swelling after the jabs. Ledum pallustre, often used after insect bites and stings involving local reactions, is another remedy to consider. Both have been reported helpful with post-jab arm tenderness. Vaccines may also irritate nerves, which can cause sensations of tingling, numbness and even shooting pain. Hypericum perforatum is a wonderful remedy often used for acute nerve injuries and irritations. I have used Hypericum successfully to ward off development of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome in individuals experiencing numbness and tingling in the injected arm after diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination. Anaphylaxis and allergic reactions are obviously best handled as a medical emergency. However, Apis mellifica in a higher potency\u2014200C and up\u2014may be helpful with acute anaphylactic reactions in general. Some people have reported itching of the arm and body post-injection, and Apis may still be a useful remedy in this case. Other remedies to consider include Histaminum, a homeopathic remedy made from histamine, and Rhus toxicodendron, a remedy made from poison ivy. In a very acute situation, the remedy may need to be taken every few minutes. Thousands of deaths have been recorded following the Covid injections, many within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and remedies such as Aconitum napellus and Arnica montana might have prevented many of them. These are two very useful homeopathic remedies for sudden, acute reactions involving collapse and near-death reactions, including possibly fatal cardiac arrest. The famous Aconitum napellus is derived from the strikingly showy as well as extremely poisonous \"monkshood\" (also known as \"wolfsbane\" or \"kill-panther\"). Ingestion of even minute amounts of the leaves or root can cause shock and cardiac arrest within minutes to hours. As homeopathy is based on the similarity principle, if someone is going into shock with cardiac symptoms, Aconitum may save the day. Another remedy to consider is homeopathic Opium, often sold as Papaver somniferum. This remedy can be indicated for shock with collapse and dullness, especially in cerebral vascular accidents (that is, strokes). There have been many reports of stroke symptoms following the Covid injections. Useful Snake Venom Remedies After Covid mRNA Injections Adverse events reported within days or a few weeks after Covid mRNA injections include various blood clotting disorders such as cardiac arrest, strokes, pulmonary embolism, thrombosis and abnormal menstrual bleeding. One possible remedy in these situations is Arnica montana, a well-known homeopathic remedy with anticoagulant properties that is often used after trauma as well as shock. A number of other remedies are also commonly utilized for such states. It is important to remember, however, that we are always supporting the vital force and the whole individual; we are not \"treating\" any \"condition\" or \"disease.\" It is best to have professional guidance in cases of abnormal clotting, but it may be a good idea to have some of these remedies on hand to assist family and friends quickly, if necessary, without needing to wait for remedies to be delivered. Considering that post-Covid injection symptoms have been likened to the effects of a rattlesnake bite, various snake venom remedies may be indicated. The clinical picture for many of the snake venoms includes cardiac symptoms, hypertension and hemorrhage as well as an intolerance to tight clothing around the neck. The snake remedies can also be indicated where there are general feelings of victimization\u2014a strong feeling among those who have been coerced into getting the Covid jabs to keep their jobs, continue their studies, look after relatives, travel and more. The most famous of the snake venom remedies for symptoms of blood clots is probably Bothrops lanceolatus, derived from the venom of the Martinican pit viper. The bite of this snake leads to multiple vascular obstructions, which is exactly what is being seen in some people after Covid injections. Of course, in homeopathic form it may help to alleviate such symptoms by supporting the vital force. Bothrops may be useful for clotting, thrombosis, tendency to stroke, pulmonary embolism and retinal hemorrhage. Lachesis mutus, a homeopathic remedy derived from the venom of the South American bushmaster snake, is associated with similar symptoms. Symptoms are often worse on the left side. One of my patients suffered a mini-stroke after her Covid mRNA injection. She lost some function of her left arm and the left side of her face. Fortunately, she was already well-informed on homeopathy and improved quickly by taking a few doses of Lachesis mutus. Crotalus horridus, a remedy made from the venom of the rattlesnake, has similar indications. Other good reasons to stock up on the snake remedies include their usefulness in cases of hemorrhagic fevers or menstrual abnormalities. Many of the snake venoms have affinity to ovarian function, especially left-sided. A patient of mine developed intractable low-grade menstrual bleeding for weeks with pains in the left ovary just from being exposed to spike protein shedding from others. Lachesis helped. Myocarditis and Pericarditis The development of many cardiac symptoms has been reported after the Covid mRNA injections, including the mentioned cardiac arrests and clotting, as well as sudden hypertension, myocarditis and pericarditis. Both myocarditis and pericarditis can involve symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, and feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart. Many cases have been reported in young children and young men. I personally have seen several cases of myocarditis in young men. Homeopathic remedies that may be helpful in such circumstances may include the homeopathic Covid injection remedies and the previously mentioned snake remedies as well as the additional snake remedy Naja tripudians, which is derived from the venom of the Indian cobra. Naja has more valvular issues than other snake remedies. The famous homeopath James Tyler Kent (a forefather of modern homeopathy) recommended it as almost a specific for valvular lesions in children.16 Naja is also indicated for violent palpitations, rapid or slowed pulse and enlarged heart. It may be particularly indicated for those who took the jab out of duty-consciousness but are feeling conflicted about it. There are other remedies that could be indicated, including Aurum metallicum, Spigelia and others. The message I'm trying to send is that homeopathy may have a lot to offer for these concerns. Other Cardiac Symptoms Following Covid Vaccine Homeopathic Belladonna and Glonoinum may potentially be helpful for individuals suffering sudden severe hypertension with intense headaches, shortness of breath and chest pain, even nosebleeds. Belladonna, a homeopathic remedy made from deadly nightshade, is famous as a remedy used in situations involving sudden, severe inflammation and other intense symptoms. Homeopathic Glonoinum is made from nitroglycerin, which in allopathic medicine is used to relieve angina symptoms. Jeremy Sherr, a homeopath in Tanzania, has observed great results with a remedy derived from the venom of the Indian red scorpion. The symptoms of being poisoned by this scorpion apparently resemble a serious case of Covid, as the venom contains potent cardiotoxins as well as neurotoxins. The remedy, Buthus tamulus, may also cover post-injection events, including the development of vascular damage and thrombosis as well as various neurological problems. According to Sherr, Covid injections can be compared to the effect of a dangerous scorpion sting!17 Vaccinosis \"Vaccinosis\" is a term that was coined by Dr. Heinrich Goullon of Weimar in a paper published in 1877. He described a state of general malaise and flu-like symptoms after smallpox vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, bone pain, skin eruptions and weakness have been frequently reported by recipients of the Covid experimental injections. Helpful homeopathic remedies to consider include remedies commonly used to assist with influenza-like symptoms, including Bryonia after Covid mRNA vaccines. Gelsemium is famous for great weakness with flu-like symptoms. Bryonia is more indicated for dehydration, being worse with motion and often with great headaches. Eupatorium is indicated when there is severe bone and/or back pain. Another remedy to consider for general, systemic effects after vaccination is Thuja occidentalis, a remedy made from a coniferous tree in the cypress family. Many practitioners routinely recommend Thuja to offset adverse vaccine reactions. Of course, these mRNA and vector DNA injections are not traditional \"vaccines.\" Nonetheless, Thuja may in some ways help the organism to eliminate some of the potentially toxic effects. James Tyler Kent thought that Thuja was helpful after vaccines because of the trace of animal products in them. Swollen lymph nodes have also been reported as an adverse event after the Covid jabs, as well as a symptom resulting from exposure to \"shedding\" or \"transmission\" of spike protein from recently jabbed individuals. Several remedies have been reported helpful for this, including Silica, Conium maculatum and Sarcodes sanguinea. Interested readers could try a 30C potency two to three times a day for a few days, or as needed. Silica is a remedy made from quartz traditionally used to help the body expel foreign substances. As we still don't know exactly what is in the Covid jabs, it would be wise to employ Silica after the injections. Jeremy Sherr has reported very positive results from using Silica post-vaccine, not only for swollen lymph nodes but also for many other post-injection concerns.18 Sarcodes sanguinea is a recently developed homeopathic remedy that may cover adverse vaccine reactions in general. In the U.S., it can be purchased from I&E Organics Apothecary. I have used it with good effect in a client who developed breast pain and swollen axillary lymph nodes after being exposed to her freshly-vaccinated husband. Conium is a homeopathic remedy made from poison hemlock that may be used in the management of stony-hard tumors, including hard, swollen lymph nodes. Neurological Disorders Following Covid Vaccine Neurological disorders following Covid injections appear prominent in all of the examined databases, and especially the military database, which recorded a thousandfold increased rate of neurological events in 2021 versus the previous five-year average. A number of high-profile scientists have already noted or are predicting the future development of many neurological ailments as a result of the \"vaccines.\" Immunologist and former NIH scientist J. Bart Classen analyzed data on adverse events reported to the UK's Yellow Card system after Covid injections and found thousands of reports of multiple symptoms that are clear signals of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and more.19 Dr. Christopher Shaw, a professor in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia with cross-appointments in the Department of Experimental Medicine and the graduate program in neuroscience, is predicting a tsunami of neurological vaccine damage that could crush the world's health care systems.20 Dr. Stephanie Seneff is a senior research scientist at MIT with four degrees from MIT in the fields of biophysics, electrical engineering and computer science. Since 2008, she has studied \"the role of nutrition and environmental toxicants on human disease, with a special emphasis on the herbicide glyphosate and the mineral sulfur.\" Speaking on Fox News on January 17, 2022, Seneff stated: \"[B]oth the mRNA vaccines and the DNA vector vaccines may be a pathway to crippling disease sometime in the future. Through the prion-like action of the spike protein, we will likely see an alarming increase in several major neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, CKD [chronic kidney disease], ALS and Alzheimer's, and these diseases will show up with increasing prevalence among younger and younger populations, in years to come. Unfortunately, we won't know whether the vaccines caused this increase because there will usually be a long time separation between the vaccination event and the disease diagnosis.21\" Seneff added that this is \"very convenient for the vaccine manufacturers, who stand to make huge profits off of our misfortunes\u2014both from the sale of the vaccines themselves and from the large medical cost of treating all these debilitating diseases.\" Once again, in homeopathy we are not treating any neurological disease per se, but rather a whole person with a constellation of symptoms. And as we are seeing, the experimental injections may cause neurological, cardiovascular, immune system and other changes all in the same individual. My goal here is just to alert readers of the possibility that homeopathy may be helpful in case someone develops long-term adverse events. The snake venom remedies need to be considered for those developing neurological symptoms, as should the red scorpion remedy, but there are also many other remedies to consider. Depending on the individual's symptoms, these might include remedies made from the \"vaccines\" administered, perhaps a remedy made from the spike protein (available, to professionals, at Alchemists Apothecary), Alumina (made from aluminum) and numerous others. Cancer and Immune Deficiencies from Covid Vaccination There are several signals pointing to increased cancer risks after Covid injections. Is there anything homeopathy may have to offer to mitigate this risk? Indeed, there may be. Homeopathy has long used homeopathic remedies prepared from cancerous tumors, called Carcinosin or Carcinosinum. There are different preparations made from different tumors or a combination of different tumors. A famous Indian homeopath, Dr. A.U. Ramakrishnan, has successfully used these remedies to help cancer patients and improve their resistance against a recurrence of cancer.22 These remedies may become more important once we start seeing the longer-term effects of these injections unfold. Another potential long-term adverse effect of the Covid injections may be the development of chronic immune deficiency, including symptoms grouped under the diagnostic umbrella of \"HIV/AIDS.\"23 Even here, homeopathy may have helpful offerings. Although remedies should always be selected with care and individualized, Jeremy Sherr, who has worked in Africa with thousands of patients deemed to have HIV/AIDS, has successfully used a remedy (called a \"nosode\") made from the blood of an AIDS patient in some cases of post-Covid injection adverse events involving immune weakness. Conclusions The experimental Covid gene therapy injections (so-called \"vaccines\") are racking up alarming numbers of adverse event reports around the world. I'm hoping that this article will help readers recognize adverse events and consider homeopathy for their mitigation, whether as a lay person or with the assistance of professionals. Having some of the remedies on hand may be life-saving for someone you love. As the medical system deteriorates, homeopathy offers real hope for the health and healing of humanity.
