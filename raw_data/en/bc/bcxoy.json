Refunding Plan The University will refund the following Refunded Bonds for agg regate debt service savings. REFUNDED BONDS General Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2008 Maturity Date (December 1) Interest Rate Par Amount Call Date Call Price CUSIP Nos. 2018 4.000% $ (1) Term Bonds. -6- A portion of the proceeds of the Bonds, together with cash to b e contributed from accounts held in connection with the Refunded Bonds, will be escrowed to the redemption date for the Refunded Bonds at which time the Refunded Bonds will be redeemed at a price of par plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. To fund the escrow, the University will purchase certain direct non-callable Government Obligations. These Government Obligations will be deposited in the custody of U.S. Bank National Association ( the \"Escrow Agent\"). The maturing principal of the Government Obligations, interest earned thereon, and necessary cash balance, if any, will provide payment of: (a) interest on the Refunded Bonds when due up to and including the redemption date; and (b) on the redemption date, the redemption price of the Refunded Bonds. The Government Obligations, inte rest earned thereon, and necess ary cash balance, if any, will irrevocably be pledged to and held in trust for the benefit of the owners of t he Refunded Bonds by the Escrow Agent, pursuant to an escrow deposit agreement to b e executed by the University an d the Escrow Agent. Verification of Mathematical Calculations Causey Demgen & Moore P.C. will verify the accuracy of the math ematical computations concerning the adequacy of the maturing principal amounts of and interest earned on the Government Obligations, to be placed together with other escrowed money in the escrow account to pay when due, pur suant to the call for redemption, the principal of and interest on the Refunded Bonds. The verification will also confirm the mathematical computations supporting the conclusion of Bond Counsel that the 2016A Bonds are not \"ar bitrage bonds\" as defined by Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Tax Code\"). Sources and Uses of Funds The proceeds of the Bonds are to be applied, together with othe r funds, as follows (amounts in table have been rounded to the nearest dollar): Sources of Funds 2016A Bonds 2016B Bonds Total(1) Par Amount of the Bonds $ 195,145,000 $ 10,015,000 $ 205,160,000 231,129,029 10,410,241 $ 241,539,270 Uses of Funds Project Fund Deposit(3) $ 200,000,000 $ -- $ 231,129,029 $ 10,410,241 $ 241,539,270 ______________ (1) Totals may not foot due to rounding. (2) Includes amounts to be contributed from accounts held in connec tion with the Refunded Bonds and an additional University contribution. (3) Includes payment of approximately $45 million of University's o utstanding General Revenue Notes (Commerc ial Paper). (4) Issuance costs include Underwrite rs' discount, legal fees, Fina ncial Advisor's fees, Escrow Agent fees, verification agent fees, rating agency fees, additional proceeds, and other costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding of the Refunded Bonds. SECURITY FOR THE BONDS Special Limited Obligations The Bonds are special fund obligations of the University, payable from General Revenues and the money and investments that are deposited into the special fund designated as the General Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, 2016 (the \"Bond Fund\"). The Bonds are not an obligation, eithe r general, special or moral, of the State, nor a -7- general or moral obligation of the University. The Registered Owners of the Bonds shall have no right to require the State, nor has the State any ob ligation or legal authorization, to levy any taxes or appropriate or expend any of its funds for the payment of the principal of or the interest or an y premium on the Bonds. The University has no taxing power. The University is obligated to pay debt service on the Bonds fr om General Revenues; how ever, the obligations of the University are not secured by a statutory lien on or securi ty interest in General Revenues. The University's commitment to apply Gen eral Revenues to pay debt service on the Bonds is a legally enforceable covenant. There is no coverage covenant, debt service reserve requirement or additional bonds test in the Resolution. General Revenues \"General Revenue\" or \"General Revenues\" means all non-appropria ted income, revenues, and receipts of the University if and to the extent such funds are not restricted in their use by law, regulation, or contract. For example, the following items are restricte d and, therefore, excluded fro m General Revenues: (a) Appropriations to the Univer sity by the State from the Stat e's General Fund; (b) Each fund the purpose of which has been restricted in writi ng by the terms of the gift or grant under which such fund has been donated, or by the donor thereof ; (c) Fees imposed upon students as a condition of enrollment at the University, including but not limited to services and activitie s fees, building fees (\"Buildi ng Fees\") and technology fees; and (d) Revenues and receipts attri butable to the Metropolitan Trac t Revenue (which consists of revenues of 11 acres owned by the Unive rsity in downtown Seattle, known as the \"Metro Tract\"). As noted under subsection (b) above, grants or other funds that are restricted by contract or donor terms are excluded from General Revenues. See \"UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\u2014 General Revenues.\" Unrestricted fund balances, to the extent that they were accumulated from mo ney that was received as General Revenues, are included in and available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. Any interest subsidy received from the federal government with respect to General Revenue Bonds is inc luded and available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. Additions to General Revenues The University reserves the right to include in General Revenue s, at its sole option, in the future, other sources of revenue or income excluded in the definition of General Revenue s. Such additions shall occur on the date and as provided in a certificate execut ed by the controller of the Uni versity (the \"Controller\") (or the successor to the functions of the Controller). The Controller shall, in the cas e of additions of items or auxiliaries to General Revenues, certify that for the preceding two Fiscal Years for w hich audited financial statements are available, the item or auxiliary maintained a \"coverage ratio\" of at least 125 percent. In the event an auxiliary or item is added to General Revenues, the obligations of that auxiliary or item may remain outstanding and have a prior claim on auxiliary Net Revenue. Deletions from General Revenues The University reserves the right to remove, at its sole option , in the future, without limitation, any revenues from General Revenues. The removal of General Revenues shall be evi denced by a certificate executed by the Controller identifying the items to be deleted. The University is not req uired to meet any coverage or other test prior to removing revenues from General Revenues. Building Fee Revenue Bonds The State Legislature (the \"Legi slature\") has previously and may in the future authorize the University to issue a bond or bonds to be paid from building fee (the \"Building Fee\") a n d t r u s t l a n d r e v e n u e s d e p o s i t e d i n t o t h e University of Washington bond retirement account, in accordance with RCW 28B.20.700 through 28B.20.740 -8- (the \"Building Fee Revenue Bond Statute\"). The Building Fee Re venue Bond Statute permits the University to issue bonds payable from and secured by a pledge of any or all of the Building Fee and trust land revenues deposited in the University of Washington bond retirement fund (\"Building Fee Revenue Bonds\"). In addition, Building Fee Revenue Bonds are payable from General Revenues and money and i nvestments in the Bond Fund. The Building Fee Revenue Bond Statute is subject to amendment from time to t ime. Although Building Fee and trust land revenues may be pledged, and may be applied, to pay a portion o f the Bonds, Bondowners should look to the University's General Revenues as the credit for payment of the Bonds. Under the Resolution, the Board of Regents has covenanted to es tablish, maintain and collect Building Fees in such amounts that will provide money sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all bonds (outstanding Building Fee Revenue Bonds and any additional building fee revenue bonds hereafter issued) payable out of the University of Washington bond retirement fund, to set aside and maintain rese rves, if any, required to secure the payment of such principal and interest, and to ma intain coverage, if any, which may be required over such principal and interest. Building Fee Revenue Bonds are n ot general or special obligatio ns of the State, but are limited obligation bonds of the University payable only from Building Fees, money and inves tments in the University of Washington bond retirement fund, General Revenues and money and investments in the Bond Fund. Additional Bonds The University may incur additional obligations, including bond s, Payment Agreements (such as interest rate swaps) and lease or other con tractual obligations, that are payable fr om General Revenues, in addition to the University's outstanding General Revenue Notes (Commercial Paper) (the \"Comm ercial Paper Notes\"), the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, the Bonds and other lease and contractual obliga tions. There are no limitations, either statutory or contractual, that would prevent the University from incurring s uch additional obligations. Payment Agreements To the extent permitted by State law, the University may enter into Payment Agreements payable from General Revenues subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions prec edent. Payment Agreements, as defined in chapter 39.96 RCW, include interest rate swaps entered into in connecti on with the issuance of bonds. The University curre ntly has no Payment Agreements in place. No Acceleration Upon Default If the University were to default on the payment of principal o f or interest on the Bonds, payment of the principal of and accrued interest on the Bonds would not be subject to accel eration. The University is liable for principal and interest payments only as they become due. In the event of mul tiple defaults in payment of principal of or interest on the Bonds, the Bondholders would be required to bring a sepa rate action for each such payment not made. Any such action to compel payment or for money damages would be sub ject to the limitations on legal claims and remedies against public bodies under State law. Debt Payment Record The University has never defaulted on the payment of principal of or interest on any of its bonds or other debt. Future Debt The University currently does not anticipate additional borrowi ng, other than Commercial Paper Notes and line of credit draws, prior to January 1, 2018. See \"UNIVERSITY DEBT A ND ESTIMATED DEBT SERVICE\u2014General Revenue Obligations.\" Between January 2018 and June 2021, the University expects to bor row approximately $232 million for projects already auth orized by the Board of Regents . Additional projects may also be funded on an interim basis with proceeds of Commercial Paper Notes or on a l ong-term basis with proceed s of bonds, in each case if approved by the Board of Regents. -9- UNIVERSITY DEBT AND ESTIMATED DEBT SERVICE General Revenue Obligations The University's General Revenue obligations take three forms: (a) General Revenue bonds, including the Bonds, and Commercial Pape r Notes. The University is authorized to issue Commercial Paper Notes from time to time in an aggrega te principal amount not to exceed $250 million, for University purposes, pursuant to a Resolution of t he Board of Regents adopted on July 16, 2009. The University issues Co mmercial Paper Notes generally t o provide interim financing for University projects, including the projects to be financed by the Bonds an d by future General Revenue bonds. The University provides self-liquidity for the payment of its Comme rcial Paper Notes, which are not secured by a bank credit or liquidity facility. (b) Leases and other contractual obligations payable from General R evenues. (i) Leases Supporting Lease Revenue B onds. The University has entered into a number of financing and other leases in connection with lease revenue bon ds, which are payable from General Revenues. University lease payments are applied to pay debt service on lease revenue bonds issued by the Washington Economic Development Finance Aut hority or by nonprofit corporations issuing bonds on behalf of the University. Lease revenue bonds have financed the University's multi-phase South Lake Union biomedical research f acilities and other clinic, research and administrative facilities. (ii) Other Contractual Obligations. The University has entered into other contracts payable from all or a component of General Revenues and, in some cases, other re venues. Reimbursed State General Obligation Bonds (\"Reimbursed Bonds\") refers to bonds a uthorized by the Legislature and issued as State general oblig ation bonds to provide proceed s to the University. These bonds are payable from all or a component of General Revenues and, in some cases, other revenues. The University also enters into equipment leases and leases in connection with State-issued certificates of participation (\"Ce rtificates of Participation\") from time to time to finance equipment and other property. (c) Line of Credit. The University has entered into a Master Finan cing Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which serves as a line of credit to be drawn upon t o finance short-term University assets. The line of credit currently allows for draws in an aggregate amoun t not to exceed $12 million through November 14, 2016. The University anticipates extending the lin e of credit, and may increase the aggregate amount to be drawn under the line of credit to an amount not to exceed $30 million. The Bonds, the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, the Commercial Paper Notes, other lease or contractual obligations, and the University's line of credit are equally an d ratably payable from General Revenues without preference, priority or distinc tion because of date of issue or otherwise.

See University of Washington Financial Statem ents, June 30, 2015 (in Appendix B). Source: The University's General Revenue Audit Supplement. Overview of Ge neral Revenues Financial support is received by the University from a variety of sources, including grants and contracts, patient services, tuition and fees, State funding, gifts, auxiliary ent erprises, investment income and sales and services. As shown in the table entitled \"GENERAL REVENUES,\" several of thes e sources are unrestricted and are included in General Revenues: auxiliary systems and patient services, stude nt tuition and fees (less student activities fees, U- Pass fees, technology fees, Building Fees and loan funds), gran t and contract indirect costs, sales and services of educational departments of the University, other operating reve nue, and invested funds distribution and net invested funds' unrealized gains and losses. -21- The following chart shows the General Revenue components for Fi scal Year 2016. GENERAL REVENUE COMPONENTS, FISCAL YEAR 2016(1) (1) Preliminary and unaudite d; subject to change. Source: The University. The following describes the largest components of General Reven ues, which include auxiliary systems and patient services, student tuition and fees, and grant and contract indirect costs. Auxiliary Systems and Patient Services. Since the University incorporated auxiliary systems and patient services revenue into General Revenues in 2009, these revenues have repr esented the largest component of General Revenues. Auxiliary systems and patient services revenue include patient services, housing and food services, other auxiliary enterprises, sports programs and other UW Medicine re venues. Auxiliary systems and patient services represent 53 percent of General R evenues in Fiscal Year 2016, and patient services and other UW Medicine revenues are 75 percent of that component, in each case based o n preliminary unaudited figures. In Fiscal Year 2015, auxiliary systems and patient services were 52 percent of General Revenues, and patient services and other UW Medicine revenues were 79 per cent of that component. See \"U W MEDICINE\" for a discussion of UW Medicine and its component units. Student Tuition and Fees. Student tuition and fees represent the second largest component o f G e n e r a l Revenues. Student tuition is established by the Board of Regen ts within the tuition-setting authority delegated by the Legislature. Following State legislative action in 2016, t he University continues to have authority to set tuition for all categories of students, with the exception of resident undergraduates. The University has tuition-setting authority for nonresident and graduate student tuition. For Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, the Legislature reduced residen t undergraduate tuition rates by five and 15 percent below Fiscal Year 2015 rates, re spectively, and limited future increases as follows: beginning with the 2017-2018 academic year, the University may increase resident undergradua te tuition by no more than the average annual percentage growth rate in the median hourly wage for Washington for the previous 14 years. See \"Other University Financial Information\u2014State Funding.\" If current tuition polic y is maintained by the Legislature in the 2017 Student Tuition and Fees, 28%Grant and Contract Indirect Costs, 8%Invested Funds, 2%Sales and Services of Educational Departments, 7%Other Operating Revenue, 2% Auxiliary Systems and Patient Services, 53%-22- legislative session, the University estimates that it will be a uthorized to increase resident undergraduate tuition by just over two per cent for the 2017- 2018 academic year. The State's adopted 2015-2017 biennial operating budget requires the University to maintain a minimum enrollment level. The current actual enrollment level is 27 percent above the minimum. Growth plans are for minimal increases in enrollment at the Seattle campus and continued growth at the Tacoma and Bothell campuses of approximately four percent per year. See \"Othe r University Financial Informa tion\u2014State Funding.\" In addition to tuition, the University charges its students a v ariety of other fees. The degree to which these fees can be increased is governed by the provisions of Initiative 960, i ts reenacting initiatives, and each omnibus appropriations act signed into law annually. As described unde r the heading \"INITIATIVES\u2014Initiative 960,\" Initiative 960 requires Legislative approval of fee increases a nd any new fee. The adopted State biennial operating budget allowed the Board of Regents to increase fees in Fiscal Years 2010 through 2016 by amounts judged reasonable and necessary by the Board of Regents. Fees include summer quarter tuition, fee-based and self- sustaining degree and certificat e programs, services and activi ty fees, student technology fees, course and lab fees, and other administrative fees. Certain other fees collected th rough proprietary transactions are also included in General Revenues, but may not be subject to Initiative 960. The University also has authority to waive or reduce tuition an d fees. Student tuition and fees revenue figures included in this Official State ment exclude amounts waived. Tu ition waivers are used to assist low-income students, recruit outstanding students, and recruit and support graduate teaching and research assistants. Tuition can be waived by the University for s tudents meeting certain eligibili ty requirements consistent with these objectives. Grants and Contracts. Grants and contracts constituted the third largest component of General Revenues in Fiscal Year 2016 based on preliminary unaudited figures. Grants and co ntracts fund a wide variety of research and training programs at the University. The University's expectations with regard to future grant and c ontract revenue are informed by its awards. Awards are received by the University over one or more fiscal years an d, when received, are presented as grant and contract revenues in the University's financial statements (see \"APPENDI X B\u2014AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014) AND REQUIRED SUPPLE MENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015)\") for more information regarding grant and contract revenues for Fiscal Y ears 2015 and 2014.

Other University Financial Information This section describes University revenues (including revenues that are excluded from General Revenues) and University expenses, and describes recent developments. Enacted in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \"Affordable Care Act\"), has changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in -23- Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, and the establishment of programs in which reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insuran ce, expands existing efforts t o tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. Further, it provides for a value-based purchasing program and the establishment of accountable care organizations (\"ACOs\") and bundled payment pilot programs, which may create sources of additional revenue. In October 2013, the Washington Health Benefit Exchange (the \"Exchange\") began open enrollment for Sta te residents through the Washington Health Plan Finder. The Exchange coupled with the expansion of the Medicaid program has resulted in providing health insurance coverage for some patients who had previously been re ceiving charity care. The Exchange also includes coverage options for previously commercially-insured patients w hose employers have elected to seek coverage for their employees in plans that are more affordable than traditional commercial plans. As part of fulfilling its mission of improving the health of th e public, UW Medicine's goals include becoming a leading ACO. This work includes measuring and improving the he alth of those served, effectively coordinating care across a continuum of care settings , providing the appropriate care in the appropriate location while operating in a dynamic environment as the federal and state governments contin ue to implement healthcare reform. Excluding Harborview M edical Center (\"Harborview\"), which is no t included in the University's financial statements, the UW Medicine clin ical enterprise, defined as UW Medical Center, Northwest and Valley, expects a negative margin (equal to -1.01 percent) for Fiscal Year 2016 b ased on preliminary unaudited figures. Results varied by medical center with Valley expecting positive financi al results. Margins were lower at Northwest for a variety of reasons, including worsening payer mix and lower tha n anticipated patient volumes. UW Medical Center also had negative margins, primarily due to the opening of a ne w patient tower, including 48 additional intensive care unit beds, one additional floor of acute care beds and new operating room capacity, including a hybrid operating room. Opening this new capacity has required an inves tment in staff resources as well as other operating expenses to accommodate new volume growth. This has resulted i n increased operating expenses and reduced margins. Management expects fina ncial performance at both faci lities and across the clinical enterprise to improve as volumes in the new capacity increase. Strategic clinical int egration throughout UW Medicine continues to be a priority. For a period beginning in Fiscal Year 2008, tuition revenue gre w as State appropriations to the University declined. In Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015, the University committed to free ze resident undergraduate tuition rates in exchange for moderate increases in State funding in both years. In Fisca l Years 2016 and 2017, despite facing required increases to K-12 funding, the Legislature reduced tuition for resident undergraduate students and substantially increased appropriations to the University to offset the lost t uition revenue. The number of freshmen applications for Autumn 2016 was the hig hest in the University's history. As of August 1, 2016, total freshmen applications were calculated at 48,453, 17 percent higher than Autumn 2015 (when 41,257 applications were submitted and 23,183 were accepted). Freshmen matriculation rates have declined slightly, averaging 36.5 percent over the last four years. Including transfer students, the total undergraduate matriculation rate has averaged 42.8 percent over the last four years. In Fiscal Year 2016, federal and non-federal grant and contract awards were $1.368 billion based on preliminary unaudited figures, a five percent increase over Fiscal Year 201 5. The University experienced a four percent decrease in total federal research funds between Fiscal Year 2015 and Fi scal Year 2016. This decrease was offset by a 39 percent increase in non-federal funding. The federal budget rem ains under significant pressure and ongoing federal funding for research could be impacted. Philanthropic support increased substantially in Fiscal Year 20 16 (based on preliminary unaudited figures) to an all- time University record with gifts and private grants totaling o ver $542 million, compared to $449 million in Fiscal Year 2015. Investment income decreased during the year resulting from decr eased investment market values. The University's operating expenses increased six percent in Fi scal Year 2015 over Fiscal Year 2014, and by eight perce nt in Fiscal Year 2016 based on preliminary unaudited figu res, due primarily to incr eased salary and benefit -24- costs. Operating revenue increas ed three percent in Fiscal Year 2016 over Fiscal Year 2015 based on preliminary unaudited figures. University Total Revenue by Source. The following shows the University's $5.0 billion in total reve nue by source for Fiscal Year 2016 (excluding Northwest and Valley revenues) based on preliminary unaud ited figures. University revenues may be restricted in w hole or part and, to the extent restricted, are excluded from General Revenues. Appropriated revenue is also exc luded from General Revenues. Re stricted, appropriated and other revenues that are excluded from General Revenues are, however, important componen ts of the University's overall financial situation.

The State appropriates funds fo r certain University operating e xpenses and for a portion of the University's capital budget. These appropriations are subject to the Legislature's biennial budget process. The following table shows University expenditures of State operatin g and capital appropriations to the University in Fiscal Years 2012 through 2016. EXPENDITURES OF STATE APPROPRIATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY BY TYPE (dollars in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016(1) Operating Appropriations $ 218.3 $ 218.2 $ 26 2.1 $ 255.2 $ 302.1 Capital Appropriations 6.1 47.1 7.7 20.8 39.2 Total Appropriations $ 224.4 $ 265.3 $ 269.8 $ 276.0 $ 341.3 (1) Preliminary and unaudite d; subject to change. Source: The University. State legislative appropriations accounted for approximately fi ve percent of the University's total revenue in Fiscal Year 2015. State appropriations for the 2013-15 biennium incre ased 20 percent over the 2011-13 biennium. State appropriations for t he 2015-17 bienn ium exceed State appropriat ions for the previous biennium by 24 percent. The Legislature continues to face budgetary pressure as a resul t of court-mandated increases in K-12 education funding. Article IX of the Washington State Constitution provi des that it is the \"paramount duty\" of the State to make \"ample provision\" for basic education. A 2012 Washington S upreme Court decision ( McCleary v. Washington ) held that the State was not adequately funding K-12 education to this constitutional standard. On August 13, 2015, the Court found that the Legislature had not a chieved full constitutional compliance and imposed sanctions in the form of a fine of $100,000 per day until the S tate adopts a complete plan for constitutional compliance. In the 2016 legisla tive session, the Legislature increased funding for K-12 education and established an education funding task force and required legislative action ad dressing K-12 funding to occur by the end of the 2017 legislative session. On October 7, 2016, the Court continued t h e s a n c t i o n s . S e e CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS\u2014Uncertainties of State Legislation and Initiativ es. The 2015 Legislature passed a final compromise operating budget for the 2015-17 biennium after two 30-day special sessions. Despite facing constitutionally-required inc reases to K-12 funding over the next several years as described above, the final State budget included targeted inves tments in public higher education including in computer science and engineerin g, health sciences and medical r esidencies, and a reduction in the tuition fees charged to resident undergraduat e students. The reduction in t he operating fee portion of tuition was addressed in part through increased State appropriations. In the 2016 supple mental legislative session, the Legislature adjusted the amount of State appropriati ons to account for revised actua l and projected enrollments. See \"General Revenues - Student Tuition and Fees.\" In addition, the Legislature authorized salary increases and pr ovided partial funding for t hose increases based on the assumption that tuition rates for students other than resident undergraduates would grow with inflation and cover compensation increases for faculty and staff. Relationship to Federal Funding Sources . T h e t w o l a r g e s t s o u r c e s o f U n i v e r s i t y f u n d i n g - p a t i e n t s e r v ices and grants and contracts - benefit directly or indirectly from fede ral funding. Research funding from federal sources continues to be a large part of the University's total research revenues. Federal funding represented 73 percent of the University's total research revenues in Fiscal Year 2016 ba sed on preliminary unaudited figures, although the University experienced a four percent decrease in total federal research funds between Fiscal Year 2015 and Fiscal Year 2016. This decrease was offset by a 39 percent increase in non-federal funding. Preliminary unaudited Fiscal Year 2016 University data shows a five percent decrease in Nati onal Institutes of Health funds and a two percent decrease in National Science Foundation funds compared to Fisca l Year 2015. Medicare and Medicaid payments represented approximately 40 per cent of total patient services revenues in Fiscal Year 2016 based on preliminary unaudited figures. -27- Investments; Invested Funds and Endowment Funds The Board of Regents is vested b y statute with the responsibili ty to manage the University's assets, including its investments. Depending whether investments are restricted or u nrestricted, investments may be available for payment of General Revenue obligations. Unrestricted fund bala nces, to the extent that they were accumulated from money that was received as General Revenues, are included in an d available to pay obligations secured by General Revenues. The Board of Regents delegates t o its Finance and Asset Managem ent Committee the responsibility to oversee the investment program. The Chief Investment Officer of the Univer sity directs the day-to-day activities of the investment portfolio, including the selection of investment managers who invest the University's funds based on the University's objectives and policies. Investment performance i s reviewed quarterly by the University of Washington Investment Management Company Board (\"UWINCO Board\") , which is an advisory committee. Information regarding the balances of and returns on the Univer sity's operating and endowment funds is reported to the Finance and Asset Management Committee on a quarterly basis . Balances and returns on these funds have varied, sometimes significantly, from period to period. Invested Funds. The total value of the University's operating fund investments (currently referred to as the University's \"Invested Funds\"), as of June 30, 2016 was $2.35 b illion based on preliminary unaudited figures, including the portion invested in the Consolidated Endowment Fu nd (\"CEF\") as described below. The Invested Funds Pool currently consists of four pools: Cash Pool, Liquidi ty Pool, Diversified Investment Pool and Capital Assets Pool (\"CAP\"). The Cash and Liquidity Pools are invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, high quality, fixed-income securities to meet the day-to-day ob ligations of the University. The Diversified Investment Pool holds CEF units that are intended to enhance th e overall portfolio return. In May 2014, the Board of Regents approved the CAP, which allows funds to be spent on approved University capital projects. The size of this pool is targeted at 10 percent of the Invested Funds, and the maximum size is limited by policy to 15 percent of the Invested Funds. University policy stipulated the following minimum and maximum percentages that the Invested Funds may be invested in these pools as of June 30, 2016. The percentages that were invested in these funds for the periods ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016 (based on preliminary unaudited figures) are shown below: Consolidated Endowment Fund . Based on preliminary unaudited figures, the total value of the CEF as of June 30, 2016 was $2.97 billion including $731 million of units owned by the Invested Funds. For the 10 years that ended June 30, 2016, the annualized return on the CEF was 5.6 percent based on these figures. The CEF year-end market values for the last 10 fiscal y ears are shown below (Fiscal Yea r 2016 information is preliminary and unaudited). See \"APPENDIX B\u2014AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JU NE 30, 2015 AND 2014) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015),\" which includes notes to the financial statements detailing the investment of the CEF.

Under the Board of Regents-approved spending policy for the CEF , quarterly distributions to programs are made based on an annual percentag e rate of four percent, applied to the five-year rolling average of the CEF's market valuation. This policy was effective with the December 2010 quarterly distributions, with the five-year averaging period implemented incrementally. The spending policy calls for an administrative fee of one percen t to support fundraising and stewardship activities (0.8 percent) and investment management (0.2 percent). Similar to program distributions, th e administrative fee is based on the CEF's five-year average market value. Gifts and Fundraising A principal source of funding for the University is private (no n-governmental) support. In Fiscal Year 2016, the University received $542.4 million in total private support fro m 143,828 donors based on preliminary unaudited figures. This is up from the trailing five-year average of $381 million. Of the $54 2.4 million receive d, approximately $249 million was private gifts and approximately $293 million w as private grants. The University expects to formally announce its third comprehensive capital campaign, wit h a goal of at least $4 billion, on October 21, 2016. The campaign will extend until June 30, 2020.

Strategic Planning and Collaborations In addition to its affiliation with Northwest and its strategic alliance with Valley, UW Medicine has entered into a number of affiliations, strategic alliances and collaborative w ith third-party entities as part of its mission to improve -31- the health of the public. These relationships address and furth er UW Medicine strategic goals as described in \"APPENDIX B-AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JU NE 30, 2015 AND 2014) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015)\" and below. In September 2013, UW Medicine signed a strategic collaboration with PeaceHealth, a non -profit healthcare organization headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, for UW Med icine to serve as PeaceHealth's complex tertiary and quaternary health system fo r specialty care. The agreement allows both organizations to work together on improving the quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of care. A s with the other arrangements described below, the two organizations will remain legally independent and there is no change in the governance or mission of either organization. In March 2014, UW Medicine and Capital Medical Center (Olympia, Washington) signed an agreement selecting UW Medicine as the healthcare system of choice for complex tert iary and quaternary car e for Capital Medical Center patients. This strategic collaboration, effective April 1, 2014, is intended to provide Capital Medical Center patients prompt access to advanced services while allowing the organizations to work together to continue improving the quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of care in the South Puget Sound region. In 2014, UW Medicine formed an accountable care network (\"ACN\") with certain other health care organizations and healthcare professionals in Western Washington. The UW Medi cine ACN was formed to focus on keeping people healthy and out of the hospital by employing evidence-ba sed preventive measures to identify and treat underlying health problems early before they become chronic con ditions. UW Medicine and certain of its ACN members entered into agreements t o provide health care services to employees of The Boeing Company beginning in January 2015. In January, 2016, UW Medicine and certain of its ACN members began providing healthcare services to certain employees of the State of Washington in a f ive-county Puget Sound area. These arrangements provide opportunities for shared savings between the ACN and th e employers based on achieving quality and financial benchmarks. If the ACN does not attain certain financ ial benchmarks, UW Medicine, along with contractually agreed upon risk-sharing payments from its ACN me mbers, will pay the employers based on their agreement on achieving quality and financial benchmarks. In 2015, UW Medicine, Skagit Regional Health and Cascade Valley Hospital and Clinics entered into a Clinical Affiliation Agreement intended to create a long-term and durabl e affiliation to integrate clinical programs to achieve the \"Triple Aim\" of better care f or individuals, better health for populations and lower per capita costs. In 2016, UW Medicine and Trios H ealth, formerly Kennewick Gener al Hospital, signed an agreement selecting UW Medicine as the healthcare system of choice for complex tertiary and quaternary care for Trios Health patients. This strategic collaboration, effective April, 2016, is intended to provide Trios Health patient s prompt access to advanced services while allowing the organizations to work together to c ontinue improving the quality, safety and cost- effectiveness of car e in the region. OTHER UNIVERSITY INFORMATION Labor Relations The University employs approximately 44,500 full-time and part- time employees, of whom approximately 18,000 are unionized. Pursuant to chapter 41.80 RCW, the University h as negotiated collective bargaining agreements to cover the 2017-2019 biennium with the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific (mariners), Service Employees International Union (\"SEIU\") Local 925 (clerical and healthcare employees), the Washington Federation of State Employees master group (service, library, public safety, skille d trade employees), and UW Police Management group (police sergeants and lieutenants who are also represented by the Washington Federation of State Employees), and the Teamsters Local Union N o. 117 (police officers). Combin ed, these unions cover approximately 8,800 employees in 16 bargaining units. The University will enter into negotiations with SEIU Local 119 9NW (registered nurse, healthcare specialist, imaging tech, social worker, ane sthesia and respiratory tech em ployees primarily at Harb orview Medical Center), and the Washington State Nurses Association (registered nurses at the University of Washington Medical Center) for 2017-2019 collective bargaini ng agreements in the winter of 2016/17. -32- With respect to agreements covered by chapter 41.56 RCW, the Un iversity will begin negotiations for a successor agreement with the American Federation of Teachers Local 6486 ( representing approximately 65 English language extension lecturers within UW Educational Outreach) in early 20 17. In spring 2015, the University reached agreement on a three-year agreemen t with the United Auto Worker s Local 4121, representing approximately 4,500 academic student employees, which will expire on April 30, 2018 . The University also reached agreement with the graphic communications bargaining unit, also represented by the Teamsters Local 117, on a contract spanning July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2019. In September of 2014, the UW Housest aff Association was certified (under chapter 41.56 RCW) as the official labor union for approximately 1,300 medica l residents and fellows at the University. Negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement com menced in January of 2015 and are ongoing. The University is currently in discussion with all unions over the upcoming institution-wide transition to a new Human Resources/Payroll system and its potential impacts. The U niversity is monitoring efforts by SEIU 925 to represent all University faculty governed under chapter 41.76 R CW. This process is ongoing. Finally, in the course of bargaining for the 2015-2017 chapter 41.80 RCW collective ba rgaining agreements, the University began the process of following the spirit of the City of Seattle minimum wage initiative (an initiative approved by the voters that raises the minimum wage to $15 per hour), although the Uni versity has taken the position that the initiative does not apply to the University. In December of 2015, the Universit y concluded negotiations with all of its unions to ensure that all represented staff at the Seattle, Bothell and T acoma campuses would receive no less than $15 per hour by January 1, 2017. In anticipation of the revisions to the Fair Labor Standards Ac t that will become effective on December 1, 2016, the University has begun impact bargaining on a small number of ove rtime exempt contract classified employees in SEIU 925 and the Washington Federation of State Employees who w ill become overtime eligible due to their salaries falling below the new salary basis level of $913 per w eek, which is more than doubl e the current salary basis level of $455 per week. Risk Management The University is exposed to risk of loss related to tort liabi lity, injuries to employees and loss of property. The University purchases insurance pr otection for workers' compensa tion as well as marine, aviation and certain other risks. The University also purch ases insurance protection for loss of property at self-sustaining units, bond-financed buildings and where otherwise required by contract; otherwise, the risk of property loss is retained, unfunded. For medical professional, general, employment practices, and automobile liability, the University maintains a program of self-insurance reserves and excess insurance coverage. The self-insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims resulting from events that hav e occurred on or before the statements of net position date. The reserve includes th e undiscounted amounts that will be required for future payments of claims that have been reported and claims related to events that have occurred b ut have not yet been reported. The self-insurance reserve is est imated through an actuarial ca lculation and included in long-term liabilities. See \"APPENDIX B\u2014AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FISCAL YEARS ENDED JU NE 30, 2015 AND 2014) AND REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSITY (FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015)\". Changes in the self-insurance reserve for the years ended June 30, 2013 through 2016 are noted below: UNIVERSITY SELF INSURANCE RESERVE (dollars in thousands) 2013 2014 2015 2016(1) Reserve at Beginning of Fiscal Year $62,919 $79,708 $67,450 $82 ,201 Incurred Claims and Changes 2 4,778 Claim Payments (11,816) $82,201 $79,153 (1) Preliminary and unaudite d; subject to change. Source: The University. -33- Pension Plans The University offers four contributory pension plans: the Wash ington State Public Employees Retirement System (\"PERS\") plan, the Washington State Teachers' Retirement System (\"TRS\") plan, the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement Sy s t e m ( \" L E O F F \" ) p l a n , a n d t h e U n iversity of Washington Retirement Plan (\"UWRP\"). PERS, TRS, and LEOFF ar e cost sharing multiple-emplo yer defined benefit pension plans administered by the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems (\"DRS\" ) . T h e U W R P , a s i n g l e - e m p l o y e r d e f i n e d - contribution plan, is administered by the University. The Univ ersity's noncontributory pens ion plan, the University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan, is a single-employe r defined-benefit plan, but is closed to employees who were not active participants on February 28, 2011. PERS, TRS and LEOFF Plan Descriptions . The University contributes to PERS, TRS, and LEOFF. PERS Pla n 1 and TRS Plan 1 provide retirement and disability benefits, alon g with minimum benefit in creases beginning at age 66 to eligible nonacademic plan members hired prior to October 1, 1977. PERS and TRS Plans 2 and 3 provide retirement and disability benefits and a cost-of-living allowan ce to eligible nonacademic plan members hired on or after October 1, 1977. In addition, PERS Plan 3 and TRS Plan 3 have a defined-contribution component, which is fully funded by employee contributions. LEOFF Plan 2 provides retirement, disability and death benefits. Members are vested after completing five years of eligible service. Th e authority to establish and amend benefit provisions resides with the Legislature subject to restrictions on impairing contractual obligations to employees. GASB Statement No. 68. In June 2012, GASB approved Statement No. 68, \"Accounting and F inancial Reporting for Pensions,\" which was effective for the University's Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Report. The University participates in several cost-sharing, multiple-employer, defined-benefit pen sion plans administered by the DRS. GASB 68 changed how the University accounts for and repor ts its partici pation in these plans. Prior GASB accounting required the University to recognize pens ion expense equal to the cash funding paid to the DRS, with no associated liability reported on the Statement of Net Position. GASB 68 requires that pension expense equal the University's share of future pension benefits earned by all participating employees due to current period service, plus/minus the impact o f any actuarial changes impacti ng the total pension liability. It also requires that the University record on the Statement of Net Position its proporti onate share of the total DRS liability for pension amounts earned by employees based on current and past service b ut not yet funded (the unfunded pension liability). Harborview, a related party of the University, is owned by King County and is not included in the University's reporting entity for GASB financia l reporting purposes. Howeve r, all of the employees who work at Harborview are University employees. Therefore, under GASB 68, the University includes the pension-related amounts pertaining to employees working at Harborview in the amounts recorded in the University's Financial Report. Harborview will continue to account for pension-related expenses using the curr ent \"funding\" approach, and does not record any of the associated GAS B 68 liabilities. Significant reporting and actuari al assumptions related to thes e DRS plans in which the University participates are as follows: Fiduciary Net Position - The pension plans' fiduciary net positions have been determi ned on the same basis as they are reported by the pension plans. DRS financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The retir ement plans are accounted for in pension trust funds using the flow of economic resources measurement fo cus and the accrual basis of accounting. Member contributions are recognized as revenues in the period i n which the contributions are earned. Employer contributions are recognized when due, and the employe r has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due, and payable in accordance with the terms of each plan. Chapter 43.33 RCW authorizes the Washington State Investment Bo ard (the \"WSIB\") to have the investment management responsibility for the pension funds. Inv estments are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included as investment income i n the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position presented in the DRS Comprehensive Annual Financia l Report. Purchases and sales of investments are recorded o n a trade-date basis. -34- DRS publishes an annual report for retirement plans, which is a vailable at: http://www.drs.wa.gov/administration/annualreport/ (which is no t incorporated into this Official Statement by this reference). Actuarial Assumptions - The total pension liability for each DRS plan was determined b y a n a c t u a r i a l valuation, conducted by the Washington State Office of the Stat e Actuary (the \"OSA\") as of June 30, 2014, with the results rolled forward to June 30, 2015 (the measureme nt period for the University's Fiscal Year 2016). The following actuarial assumptions have been applied to all prior periods included in the measurement: 3.0 percent total economic inflation, 3.75 percent salary infla tion Salary increase - expected to grow by promotions and longevity in addition to salary inflation assumption 7.50 percent investment rate of return Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Tabl e and Combined Disabled Table published by the Society of Actuaries' Retirement Plans Experie nce Committee (\"RPEC\"). As recommended by the RPEC, the OSA applied offsets to the base table and recognized future improvements in mortality by projecting the mortality rates using 100 percen t Scale BB. Mortality rates are applied on a generational basis, meaning members are assumed to receive addi tional mortality improvements in each future year, throughout their lifetime. The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2014 valuation w ere based on the results of OSA's 2007- 2012 Experience Study, which is a comprehensive review and upda te of prior actuarial assumptions. Additional assumptions for subsequent events and law changes ar e current as of the 2014 actuarial valuation report. In August 2016 OSA issued its Report of the Combined Actuarial Valuation as of June 30, 2015 for the primary purpose of determining contribution re quirements for the 2017-2019 biennium based on a June 30, 2015 measurement date and under the funding policy established by the Legislature. The valuation also provides information on the funding progress and developments in the plans over the past year. The OSA report included a lowered long-term assumed rate of investment return from 7.8 to 7.7 percent for all systems except LEO FF 2, which remains at 7.5 pe rcent. This assumption change led to lower funded status on an actuarial value basis and higher calculated contribution rates than calculated last valuation. Note that the OSA report is used to convey informat ion for determining funding policy (contribution rates); DRS reports are used to comply with the r eporting requirements of GASB 68 (that is, for financial reporting purposes). The long-term expected rate of ret urn on pension plan investmen ts was determined by the WSIB using a building block method in which a best estimate of expected futu re rates of return (expe cted returns, net of pension plan investment expense, but including inflation) are d eveloped for each major asset class. Those expected returns make up one component of WSIB's Capital Market Assumptions (\"CMAs\"). WSIB uses the CMAs and their target asset allocation to simulate future i nvestment returns over various time horizons. The long-term expected rate of return of 7.50 percent approximately equals the median of the simulated investment returns over a 50-year time horizon, adjusted to rem ove or damper any short term changes that are not expected over the entire 50-year measurement period. Discount Rate - The discount rate used to measure the total pension liabilities was 7.50 percent. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate as sumed that contributions from plan members will be made at contractually required rates, and that contribu tions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined (including t he component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued lia bilities for PERS 1 and TRS 1, respectively). Based on those assumptions, the fiduciary net position for each p e n s i o n p l a n i n w h i c h t h e U n i v e r s i t y participates was projected to be sufficient to make all project ed future benefit payments of the current plan members. Therefore, the long-ter m expected rate of return on p ension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pe nsion liability. -35- Using the WSIB long-term expected rate of return, a 7.50 percen t future investment rate of return on pension plan investments was assumed for the test. The expecte d return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligation. Contributions from plan members and employers were assumed to c ontinue to be made at contractually required rates (including the component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities for PERS 1 and TRS 1, re spectively, as provided for in Chapter 41.45 RCW). Employer Contribution Rates. Employer contribution rates are developed in accordance with Ch apter 41 RCW by the OSA, and include an administrative expense component that i s currently set at 0.18 percent. To calculate employer and employee contribution rates necessary to pre-fund the plans' benefits, OSA uses actuarial cost and asset valuation methods selected by the Legislature as well as economic and demographic assumptions. All DRS-administered retirement plans are funded by a combination of funding sources: (1) contributions from the State; (2) contributions from employers (including the University as employer and other governmental employers); (3) contributions from employees; and (4) investment returns. R etirement funds are inve sted by the WSIB. Under State statute, employee contribution rates for PERS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 1 are fixed by the Legislature and not subject to periodic review. All other contribution rates are ad opted by the Pension Funding Council (\"PFC\") (and, for LEOFF Plan 2, by the LEOFF 2 Board) in even-numbered years for the next ensuing State biennium. The rate- setting process begins with an actuarial valuation by the OSA, which makes non-binding recommendations to the Select Committee on Pension Policy, which recommends contribution rates to the PFC and the LEOFF 2 Board. No later than the end of July in even-numbered years, the PFC and LEOFF 2 Board adopt contribution rates, which are subject to revision by the Legislature. Employer and employee c ontribution rates as of August 16, 2016 have been adopted for the 2017-2019 bienni um, subject to change by the Le gislature, and are published by DRS. The University's proportionate s hare of the Statewide required contributions for each DRS plan in which the University participates as of J une 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the table below.

Faculty, librarians and professional staff are eligible to participate in the UWRP, a 403(b) defined-contribut ion plan, and the UW Supplemental Retirement Plan, a 401(a) defined-benef it retirement plan which is closed to new participants and operates in tandem with the 403(b) plan. Both plans are administered by the University. UWRP Description . Contributions to the UWRP are invested by participants in ann uity contracts or mutual fund accounts offered by one or more fund sponsors. Employees have at all times a 100 percent vested interest in their accumulations. Benefits from the plan are av ailable upon separation or retirement at the member's option. RCW 28B.10.400 et seq . assigns the authority to the Board of Regents to establish an d amend benefit provisions. UWRP Funding Policy . Employee contribution rates are five percent, 7.5 percent or 1 0 percent of salary, based on age. The University matches the contributions of empl oyees. Within parameters established by the Legislature, contribution requirements may be established o r amended by the Board of Regents. -37- Employer contributions for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 20 15 were $111,015,000 and $105,266,000 respectively. UW Supplemental Retirement Plan Description . This plan provides for a supplemental payment component, which guarantees a minimum retirement benefit based upon a one-time calculation at each eligible participant's retirement date. The University makes direct payments to qualif ying retirees when the retirement benefits provided by the UWRP plan do not meet the b enefit goals. During Fiscal Year 2011, the University amended the Supplemental Retirement Plan, limiti ng participation to those individuals who were active participants on February 28, 2011. UW Supplemental Retirement Plan Funding. The University received an actuarial valuation of the supplemental payment component of the UWRP with a valuation dat e of July 1, 2015. The previous evaluations were performed in 2013 and 2011. The University ha s set aside $198,831,000 and $188,881,000 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for th is liability. These funds do not meet the GASB technical definition of \"Pl an Assets\" because they have not been segregated and restricted in a trust or equivalent arrangement. The UAAL shown, therefore, does not reflect a credit for these amounts. Statistics Related to the UWRP. The Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (\"UAAL\") and Annual Required Contribution (\"ARC\") for the UWRP as of July 1 of the respective years are shown in the following table.

The HCA calculates the premium amounts each year that are sufficient to fund the State-wide health and life insurance programs on a pay-as-you-go basis. These costs are passed through to individual State agencies (in cluding the University) ba sed upon active employee headcount; the agencies pay the premiums for active employees t o the HCA. The agencies may also charge employees for certain higher cost options elected by the employ ee. State retirees may elect coverage through State health and life insurance plans, for which they pay less than the full cost of the benefits, based on their age and other demographic factors. The healthcar e premiums for active employees, which are paid by the agency during employees' worki ng careers, subsidize the \"underpayments\" of retirees. An additional factor in the OPEB obligation is a payment that is required by the Legislature to reduce the premiums for retirees covered by Medicare (an \"explicit\" subsidy). For both calendar years 2015 and 2014, this amount was $150 per retiree eligible for par ts A and B of Medicare. This is also passed through to state agencies through active employee rates charged to the agency. There is no formal State or Univ ersity plan that underlies the subsidy of retiree health and life insurance. Actuarial Study. Actuarial studies, performed every two years by the OSA, calcul ated that the total OPEB obligation of the State at January 1, 2015 and 2013 was $5.3 bi llion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The annual required contribution was $498 million and $342 million for the State for 2015 and 2013, respectively. The OSA calculated the OPEB obligation based on individual State employ ee data, including age, retirement eligibility and length of service. The probability of an employee of a given a ge and length of service retiring and receiving OPEB benefits is based on State-wide historical data. The OSA's allocation of the cumulative State-wide liability rel ated to the University and its unconsolidated affiliates was estimated at approximately $997 million and $671 million fo r 2015 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are not included in the University's financial statements. The University paid $324 million and $248 million for healthcar e expenses in Fiscal Years 2016 and 2015, respectively, which included its pay-as-you-go portion of the O PEB liability, calculated by the OSA at $7.9 million in both 2016 and 2015. The OSA report is available at: http://osa.leg.wa.gov/Actuarial _Services/OPEB/OPEB.htm (which is not incorporated into this Official Statement by this reference). LIMITATIONS ON REMEDIES Any remedies available to the Registered Owners of the Bonds up on the occurrence of an event of default under the Resolution are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions which are in turn often subject to discretion and delay and could be both expensive and time-consuming to obtain. If the University fails to pay principal of or interest on the Bonds, there can be no assurance that available remedies will be adequate to fully protect the interests of the Registered Owners of the Bonds. In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Res olution, the rights and obligations under the Bonds and the Resolution may be limited by and are subject to bankrup tcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases. The opinions to be delivered by Pacifica Law Group LLP, as Bond Counsel, concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, will be subject to limitations regarding bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights. A complete copy of the proposed forms of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPEN DIX C\u2014\"FORMS OF BOND COUNSEL OPINIONS.\" -39- Under State law, \"taxing distric ts\" are authorized to voluntari ly file a petition for bankruptcy under the federal bankruptcy code. The State is not authorized to file a petitio n for bankruptcy. Although the University is a political subdivision in some contexts, it is not considered a taxing dis trict under State property, excise or other tax statutes and does not have taxing power. Accordingly, it is not clear t hat the University has authority under State law to voluntarily file a petition for bankruptcy. State law does not provide for involuntary bankruptcy against the State or its political subdivisions. The Board of Regents is authori zed under State law to obligate all or a component of the fees and revenues of the University for the payment of bonds, notes, or evidences of ind ebtedness, and the University has pledged General Revenues to the payment of principal of and interest on the Bon ds. State law does not provide for a statutory lien on General Revenues, and Bondholders have no lien on or security i nterest in General Revenues. CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS The purchase of the Bonds involves in vestment risk. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consider carefully all of the information set forth in this Official Statem ent, including its appendices, evaluate the investment considerations and merits of an investment in the Bonds and confer with their own tax and financial advisors when considering a purchase of the Bonds. The Bonds are payable from General Revenues, which include auxi liary systems and patient services, student tuition and certain fees, grant and contract indirect costs, sales and services of educational departments of the University, other operating revenue, and invested funds' distribution and n et invested funds' unrealized gains and losses. The University's ability to derive General Revenues from these sour ces sufficient to pay debt service on the Bonds depends on many factors, some of which are not subject to the c ontrol of the University. The following section discusses some of the factors affecting General Revenues; it ca nnot, however, describe all of the factors that could affect General Revenues. Uncertainties in the Higher Education Sector Through the recession and slow r ecovery, the U.S. higher educat ion sector has faced uncertainties in an environment of rising tuition, changing enrollment trends, high student deb t burdens, reduced state appropriations, federal funding constraints, competition for sponsored research, lower but recovering endowment returns, and gift trends reflecting economic conditions. For the largest universities, growth in patient care revenue, investment income, and grants and contracts are important factors in terms of revenue outlook. The higher education sector has experienced increased operating expenses as well as significant demand for capital investment in housing, dining, and student amenities, and in addressing deferred maintenance including on aging facilities now requiring renovation. The higher education sector has experienced changing technology and delivery models, including a growth in online educational options and technology-related expenses. Recent pr oposals to reduce or eliminate the tuition and student debt levels confronting low and middle-income families may have implications for the higher education sector. Patient Services Revenues; Uncer tainties of the Health Care Sec tor Patient services revenue is the largest component of General Re venues. The University gen erates patient services revenues through the operation of three hospitals as well as ne ighborhood and other clinics. (The University also operates Harborview, but Harborview's results are not included in the University's financial statements.) The ability of the University to generate patient services revenue depends, in part, upon the financial health of the health care sector. Challenges inherent to the healthcare sector include p otential funding cuts for Med icare and Medicaid, lower patient volumes, uncertainty over healthcare reform implementation and payer reimbursement pressure. The sector has undergone signifi cant legislative and regulatory change, and these changes and other factors have led to mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, bankruptcies and clos ures. The University has entered into a num ber of recent affiliations, strategic alliances and collaborative rela tionships, and may enter into future arrangements. The University has experienced and expects a continued period of tr ansition as the University works to align affiliated and third-party entities' service s and performance with broader UW Medicine objectives. -40- UW Medical Center and UW Medicine's other hospitals have agreem ents with federal and State agencies and commercial insurers that provide for payments at amounts less t han gross charges. The payer mix is a key factor in the overall financial operating performance of the various UW M edicine components providing patient services. Tuition and Student Fee Revenues Tuition and student fees are the second largest component of Ge neral Revenues. Certain significant components of General Revenues, most significantly student tuition, are consi dered fees subject to Initiative 960, an initiative that requires legislative approval f or any fee increase or new fees. See \"INITIATIVES.\" Tuition is established by the Board of Regents within the tuition-setting authority delegated by the Legislature and subject to certain statutory limits. For Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016, the Legislature reduce d tuition levels for resident undergraduate students, and limited future increases to a statutory growth factor. In addition to tuition, the University charges its students a variety of other fees that may be subject to Initiative 960. A portion of student tuition and fee revenue is derived from fi nancial aid provided to st udents. Federal, State, institutional and private funders may not appropriate or approve funding for grant, scholarship, loan and other financial aid programs at the same level and under the same ter ms in the future, which may affect the amount of financial aid available to University students. Uncertainties of State Legislation and Initiatives The Legislature considers legisl ation from time to time that ma y affect the University, including without limitation legislation appropriating funds for higher education, legislati on authorizing Building Fee Revenue Bonds or Reimbursed Bonds for the benefit of the University, and legisla tion regarding public employees, benefits, tuition, academic standards, public procure ment and contracting, and oth er matters. The Legislature continues to face budgetary pressure as a result of court-mandated increases in K -12 education funding, in light of the State constitutional mandate to fund basic education and a 2012 Washi ngton Supreme Court decision that the State was not adequately funding basic education to this constitutional standard. See \"UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\u2014 Other University Fin ancial Information.\" As described under the heading \"INITIATIVES,\" State initiative measures have been filed from time to time affecting the University or its revenues, including Initiatives 601 and 960. Various State initiative measures have been and may be filed, and approved, from time to time that may have a fiscal impact on the University and/or the State, and if affecting the Stat e, may impact State spending on higher education, including State appropriations to the University. Uncertainties of the Federal Budget Two of the largest sources of University funding - patient serv ices and grants and contracts - benefit directly or indirectly from federal funding. Research funding from federal sources continues to be a large part of the University's total research revenues. Federal funding, includin g federal research funding and healthcare reimbursement funding, is subject to federal legislative action , including through the f ederal budget process and sequestration. State and local reductions in funding could also affect University revenues. A shift from federal to non-federal research funding could reduce the relative amount o f funding for indirect costs. Laws and Regulation The University is subject to federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Failure by the University to comply with, or violations of, statutory and regulatory requirements could r esult in the loss of federal or State grant funds and other consequences. These statutory and regulatory requirement s are subject to change and could become more stringent and costly for the University. The healthcare industry i s s u b j e c t t o n u m e r o u s l a w s a n d r e g u l a t ions of federal, State, and local governments, including the Affordable Care Act. These laws and regulations i nclude, but are not limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, governmental healthcare program parti cipation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, privacy of health records, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government agencies are actively -41- conducting investigations concerning possible violations of fra ud and abuse statutes and regulations by healthcare providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government healthcare programs, together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties , as well as significant rep ayments for patient services previously billed. Recent regulatory, legislative and accountin g activity will impact all entities in UW Medicine during Fiscal Year 2017 and beyond. Accounting Rules The University is subject to acco unting rules and standards pro mulgated by GASB. These rules may change, requiring the University at such time to value and state its ac counts differently. Limitation on Remedies Under the terms of the Resolution, payments of debt service on Bonds are required to be m ade only as they become due and the occurrence of a default does not grant a right to a ccelerate payment of the B onds. In the event of multiple defaults in payment of principal of or interest on the Bonds, the Bond owners could be required to bring a separate action for each such pay ment not made. Remedies for d efaults are limited to such actions which may be taken at law or in equity. No mortgage, deed of trust, lien or security interest has been granted to secure the payment of the Bonds. See \"LIMITATIONS ON REMEDIES.\" Seismic and Other Considerations The University's Seattle, Tacoma and Bothell campuses are in an area of seismic activity, with frequent small earthquakes and occasional modera te and larger earthquakes. Th e University can give no assurance regarding the effect of an earthquake, a tsunami from seismic activity in the State or in other areas, a volcano, mudslide or other natural disaster, climate change or acts of terrorism, or that the University's self-insuran ce reserves or proceeds of insurance carried by the Univers ity, if any, would be sufficient, if available, to rebuild and reopen University facilities or that University facilities or surrounding facilities and infrastructure could or would be rebuilt and reopened in a timely manner following a major earthquake or oth er disaster. See \"OTHER UNIVERSITY INFORMATION\u2014Risk Management\" for a description of the Universit y's insurance, includi ng self-insurance. Continuing Compliance with Tax Covenants; Changes of Law The University's tax certificate will contain various covenants and agreements on the part of the University that are intended to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of int erest on the 2016A Bonds. A failure by the University to comply with such covenants and agreements, including any rem ediation obligations, could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the tax-exempt status of interests on the 2016 A Bonds. Any loss of tax-exemption could cause all of the interest received by the Owners of the 2016A Bonds to be taxable. All or a portion of interest on the 2016A Bonds also could become subject t o federal income tax as a result of changes of law. Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Tax Code o r court decisions may cause interest on the 2016A Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such in terest. INITIATIVES State Initiatives and Referenda Under the State Constitution, the voters of the State have the ability to initiate legislation and to modify existing laws through the powers of initiative and referendum. An initi ative measure is submitted to the voters (if an initiative to the people) or to the Legislature (if an initiati ve to the Legislature) if certified by the Secretary of State. An initiative or referendum approved by a majority of voters ma y not be amended or repealed by the Legislature within a period of two years fo llowing enactment, except by a v ote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house of the Legislature. After two years, the law is subject to amendment or repeal by the Legislature in the same manner as other laws. -42- Initiative 601 Initiative 601, approved by State voters in 1993, limits State expenditures and revenues. Under Initiative 601, the State generally is prohibited from increasing expenditures from the State's general fund and related funds during any fiscal year by more than the fiscal growth factor, which equals the average growth in State personal income for the prior ten fiscal years. Initiativ e 601 also limits State revenu e increases. Finally, Initiative 601 provides that no fee may increase in an y fiscal year by a percentage greater than the fiscal growth factor without prior legislative approval. The term \"fe e\" is not defined in the initiative, so the University has interpreted informal guidance from the State Attorney General's Office to identify specific types of University fees as either covered by or exempt from Initiative 601. Under the policy, mandatory fees related to the regular State- funded instructional program or other degree-granting education programs are considered subject to Initiative 601. Other University fees are considered proprietary and not subjec t to the Initiative 601 limitation. Initiative 960 Initiative 960, approved by State voters in November 2007, amen ded Initiative 601 to require legislative approval of all fee increases without regard to a fiscal growth factor. In itiative 960 also requires legislative approval of any new fee. Initiative 960 did not amend or define the term \"fee\" use d in Initiative 601. On January 31, 2008, the State Office of Financial Management distributed to State agencies an informal memorandum (the \"OFM Memo\"). Under the reasoning of the OFM Memo (and the University policy interpreting Initiative 601), certain components of General Revenues, most significantly student tuition, are co nsidered fees subject to Initiative 960 and therefore cannot be increased without legis lative approval. Other fees c ollected through proprietary transactions are also included in General Revenues, but would not be considered fees subject to Initiative 960 under the reasoning of the OFM Memo. In the event that Initiative 960 were applied to limit the University's ability to increase fees that contribute to General Revenues, the University would, if necessary, seek to o btain legislative approval fo r fee increases or would pursue alternative revenue sour ces, program cuts or reallocatio ns. Other Initiatives Other State initiative measures h ave been or may be filed from time to time affecting the University or its revenues. LEGAL INFORMATION No Litigation Con cerning the Bonds There is no litigation pending or, to the actual knowledge of t he University, threatened questioning the validity of the Bonds or the power and authority of the University to issue the Bonds or seeking to enjoin the issuance of the Bonds. Other Litigation The University is a party to lawsuits arising out of its normal course of business, but the University does not believe any of such litigation will have a significant adverse impact u pon the financial position of the University. Some of these claims are cover ed by insurance. Approval of Counsel Legal matters incident to the authorization, issuance and sale of Bonds by the University are subject to the approving legal opinion of Pacifica Law Group LLP, Seattle, Washington, \" Bond Counsel.\" The forms of opinions of Bond Counsel are attached hereto as Appendix C. Certain legal matte rs will be passed upon for the Underwriters by their counsel, Foster Pepper PLLC, Seattle, Washington. Any opinion of such firm will be limited in scope, addressed solely to the Underwriters and c annot be relied upon by investo rs. -43- TAX MATTERS RELATING T O THE 2016A BONDS General In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing law and subject to certain qualifications described below, interest on the 2016A Bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Tax Code, and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations; however, interest on the 2016A Bo nds is taken into account in determining adjusted current earnings for the purpose of computing the alternative m inimum tax imposed on certain corporations. The proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the 2016A Bonds to be delivered on the date of issuance of the 2016A Bonds is set forth in Appendix C. The Tax Code contains a number of requirements that apply to th e 2016A Bonds, and the University has made certain representations and has c ovenanted to comply with each such requirement. Bond Counsel's opinion assumes the accuracy of the representations made by the University and is subject to the condition that the University comply with the above-referenced covenan ts. If the University fails t o comply with such covenants or if the University's representations are inaccurate or incomplete, interest on the 2 016A Bonds could be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes retro actively to the date of issuance of the 2016A Bonds. Except as expressly stated herei n, Bond Counsel expresses no op inion regarding any tax consequences related to the ownership, sale or disposition of the 2016A Bonds, or the amoun t, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2016A Bonds. Owners of the 2016A Bonds should consult their tax advis ors regarding the applicability of any collateral tax consequences of owning the 2016A Bonds. Original Issue Premium and Discount If the initial offering price to the public (excluding bond hou ses and brokers) at which a Bond is sold is less than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference consti tutes \"original issue discount\" for purposes of federal income taxes. If the initial offering price to the public (exc luding bond houses and brokers) at which a Bond is sold is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then su ch difference constitutes \"original issue premium\" for purposes of federal income taxes. De mini mis original issue di scount and original issue premium is disregarded. Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as inter est excluded from federal gross income to the extent properly allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitat ions described in the first paragraph of this section. The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity o f the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with str aight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The amount of original issue discount accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain upon disposition (including sal e, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bond. The Tax Code contains certain provisions relating to the accrual of original issue discount in the case of purchasers of the 2016A Bonds who purchase the Bonds after the initial offering of a substantial amount of such maturity. Owners of such Bonds should consult their own tax ad visors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, the allowance of a deduction for any loss on a sale or other disposition, and the treatment of accrued original issue discount on such Bonds under federal ind ividual and corporate alternative minimum taxes. Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an a nnual basis over the term of the Bond (said term being the shorter of the Bond's maturity date or its call date) . The amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner of the Bond for pu rposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition. The amount of original issue premium on a Bond is amortized each year over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). Amort ized Bond premium is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Owners of pr emium Bonds, including purcha sers who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax advisors with respect to federal income tax consequences of owning such Bonds. -44- Post Issuance Matters The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority , covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel's judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2016A Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the University, or about the effect of future changes in the Tax Code, the applica ble regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. Bond Counsel's engagement with respect to the 2016A Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2016A Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to def end the University or the Owners regarding the tax- exempt status of the 2016A Bonds in the event of an audit exami nation by the IRS. Under current procedures, parties other than the University and its appointed counsel, including the Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examin ation process. Moreover, becaus e achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of 2016A Bonds is difficult, obtaining an ind ependent review of IRS positions with which the University legitimately disagrees, may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the 2016A Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketabilit y of, the 2016A Bonds, and may cause the University or the Owners to incur significant expense. Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Tax Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2016A Bond s to be subject, directly or in directly, to federal income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full current benef it of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification o f the Tax Code or court decisions may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, the 2016A Bonds. Prospe ctive purchasers of the 2016A Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed legisl ation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion. Not Bank Qualified The University has not designated the 2016A Bonds as \"qualified tax-exempt obligations\" within the meaning of Section 265(b)(3)(B) of the Tax Code. CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE 2016B BONDS The interest on the 2016B Bonds is not intended by the Universi ty to be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Owners of the 2016B Bonds should be aware that the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on , the 2016B Bonds may have federal income tax consequences not described herein and should consult their own tax advisors with respect to feder al income tax consequences of owning such 2016B Bonds. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the 2016B Bonds other than as expressly described above. The proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to th e 2016B Bonds to be delivered on the date of issuance of the 2016B Bonds is set forth in Appendix C. ERISA CONSIDERATIONS The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( \" E R I S A \" ) a n d t h e T a x C o d e g e n e r a l l y prohibit certain transactions between a qualified employee bene fit plan under ERISA or tax-qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts under the Tax Code (co llectively, the \"Plans\") and persons who, with respect to a Plan, are fiduciaries or other \"parties in interes t\" within the meaning of ERISA or \"disqualified persons\" within the meaning of the Tax Code. All fiduciaries of Plans, i n consultation with their advisors, should carefully consider the impact of ERISA and the Tax Code on an investment in any Bonds. In all events investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the federal, stat e, local and other tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Bonds. -45- CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING Undertaking. The University is covenanting for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data (the \" Annual Disclosure Report\") by not later than seven months following the end of the University's fiscal year (which currently would be January 31, 2017, for the report for Fiscal Year 2016), and to pr ovide notices of the occurrence of certain enumerated events. The Annual Disclosure Report and notices of material events are to be file d with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Dis closure Report and in notices of material events is set forth in APPENDIX E\u2014\"FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFIC A T E . \" T h e s e c o v e n a n t s a r e m a d e b y t h e U n i v e r s i t y t o a s s i s t t h e U n d e r w r i t e r s o f t h e B o n d s in complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12(b)(5). Prior Compliance with Continuing Disclosure Undertakings . In reviewing its continuing disclosure filings on EMMA, the University determined that, while it had timely filed its annual financial and operating information in the form of its UW Bondholders Report in connection with its Ge neral Revenue Bonds, the UW Bondholders Report was not linked to the CUSIP numbers for all bonds issued by or on behalf of the University. On July 16, 2014, the University re-filed its UW Bondholders Reports for the years en ded June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2013, to link these reports to the CUSIP numbers for outstanding bond issues. With respect to notices of material or listed events, the Unive rsity provided notice of certain insurer ratings downgrades, but has determined that notices had not been filed for every ratings event. On August 8, 2013, the University filed notices regarding the downgrade of the insurer of the 2011 Bonds, and on July 16, 2014, the University filed a supplemental notice of insurer rating change s for outstanding insured bond issues. On October 12, 2016, the University filed a supplement updating and correcting figures included in the 2015 Bondholders Report. OTHER BOND INFORMATION Ratings Ratings of \"Aaa\" and \"AA+\" have been assigned to the Bonds by M oody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings Service, respectively. Such ratings reflect only the v iews of the rating organizations, and an explanation of the significance of the ratings may be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in the judgment of t he agencies, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of any of the ratings could have an adverse effect on the marke t price of the Bonds. Financial Advisor The University has retained Piper Jaffray & Co., as financial a dvisor (the \"Financial Advisor\") in connection with the preparation of the University's plan of financing and with respect to the authorization and issuance of the Bonds. The Financial Advisor is not obligated to undertake, and has not undertaken, to make any independent verification or to assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or fairness of the information contained in this Official Statement. While under contract to the University, the Financi al Advisor may not participate in the underwriting of any University debt. Potential Conflicts Some or all of the fees of the Financial Advisor, Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel are contingent upon the sale of the Bonds. Pacifica Law Group LLP is serving as Bond Counse l and Disclosure Counsel to the University with respect to the Bonds. From time to time Bond Counsel and Discl osure Counsel serve as counsel to other parties involved with the Bonds with respect to transactions other than the issuance of the Bonds. From time to time counsel to the Underwriters serves as special counsel to the Un iversity and to the Financial Advisor in matters unrelated to the issuance of the Bonds. -46- Underwriting The Bonds are to be purchased pursuant to and subject to the te rms of a bond purchase contract between the University and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporat ed, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Drexel Hamilt on, LLC (collectively, the \"Unde rwriters\"). The purchase price of the 2016A Bonds is $230,116,375.37, repre senting the aggregate principal amount of the 2016A Bonds ($195,145,000.00), plus original issue premium of $ 35,401,486.20, and less Underwriters' discount of $430,110.83. The purchase price of the 2016B Bonds is $10,186,891.15, repres enting the aggregate principal amount of the 2016B Bonds ($10,015,000.00), plus original issue premium of $1 94,029.45, and less Underwriters' discount of $22,138.30. The Underwriters and their respective affiliates are full servi ce financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and broker age activities. Certain of the Underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various investment banking services for the University, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, th e Underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt an d equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long a nd short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve securitie s and instruments of the University. The initial public offering prices or yields set forth on the i nside cover page may be changed from time to time by the Underwriters without prior notice. The Underwriters may of fer and sell the Bonds to certain dealers, unit investment trusts or money market funds at prices lower than th e public offering prices or at yields higher than the yields stated on the inside cover page. The University will use a porti on of the proceeds from this off ering to redeem the Refunded Bonds. To the extent an Underwriter or an affiliate thereof is an owner of Refunded Bonds, such Underwriter or affiliate, as applicable, would receive a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of th e Bonds contemplated herein in connection with such Refunded Bonds redeemed by the University. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., an underwriter of the Bonds, has entered into a retail distribution agreement with UBS Financial Services Inc. (\"UBSFS\"). Under the distribution agreements, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. may distribute municipal securities to retail investors through the financial advisor network of UBSFS. As part of this arrangement, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. may compensate UBSFS for their selling efforts with respect to the Bonds. Independent Auditor The selected financial statements of the University for the Fis cal Years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 and included as Appendix B to this Official S tatement have been audited by K PMG LLP (\"KPMG\"). KPMG has not been e n g a g e d t o p e r f o r m a n d h a s n o t p e r f o r m e d , s i n c e t h e d a t e o f i t s report included therein, any procedures on the financial statements addressed in that report.

Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.As discussed in note 1, the financial statements of the University of Washington, an agency of the state of Washington, are intended to present the financial position, and the changes in financial position and where applicable, cash flows of only the respective portion of the activities of the state of Washington that is attributable to the transactions of the University of Washington and its discretely presented component units.

Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the University of Washington as of June 30, 2015, and the changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the year then ended, and the financial position of its discretely presented component units as of June 30, 2015, and the changes in their financial position for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Other Matter U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 3 through 11, and the schedules of required supplementary information on pages 46 through 47, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of the financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries with management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Emphasis of Matter As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, on July 1, 2014, the University adopted new accounting guidance requiring governments providing defined benefit pensions to their employees to recognize their proportionate share of the pension plan's net pension liability or net pension asset, as well as recognizing most changes in the net pension liability within pension expense. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

This discussion has been prepared by management and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes that follow this section. Financial Highlights for Fiscal Year 2015 The University recorded an increase in net position of $235 million in fiscal year 2015; $243 million less than the fiscal year 2014 increase of $478 million. This is primarily related to a decrease in investment income of $254 million in fiscal year 2015, a result of decreased investment market values during the year. The University adjusts the carrying value of investments to market value each year, with the change recorded as investment income or loss. Revenues from tuition and patient services continued to show growth during 2015, while revenues from research activities were mostly unchanged. Operating revenues minus operating expenses typically result in an operating loss in the University's financial statements. Nonoperating items, however, including state support, investment income, and gifts have typically enabled the University to reflect an increase in the net position, or \"equity\" each year. This surplus has been reinvested within the University to add a margin of educational excellence, upgrade the University's facilities and provide a prudent reserve for contingencies such as the recent period of economic instability. The University implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions\" during fiscal year 2015. This Statement changed how the University reports its participation in certain cost sharing, defined benefit pension plans administered by the state of Washington Department of Retirement Systems (DRS). It requires governments providing defined-benefit pensions to their employees to recognize their proportionate share of the pension plan's net pension liability or net pension asset, which is measured as the total pension liability less the amount of the pension plan's fiduciary net position. This Statement requires most changes in the net pension liability be included in pension expense in the period of the change, and others to be reported as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources on the Statement of Net Position. Prior to adopting this Statement, the University reported pension expense based on cash contributions paid to the pension plan administrator. With the adoption of GASB Statement No. 68, net position was restated at July 1, 2014 by $832 million. Fiscal year 2015 financial results reflect application of the accounting changes required by Statement No. 68, but those changes have not been applied to fiscal year 2014 amounts due to the constraints of available information. Economic Factors Affecting the Future A number of contingencies face the University over the next few years. The slow economic recovery is a primary source of uncertainty. The state of Washington, which provided 6% of the University's total revenues in fiscal year 2015, continues to emerge from the recession. The effect of required increases to K-12 funding over the next several years, together with other economic factors such as slow growth and insufficient tax revenues, could result in added uncertainty for other state programs, including higher education. The University's 2016 general operating appropriation from the state (excluding amounts appropriated for specific purposes) is approximately $292 million, an increase from 2015. This increase is largely attributed to targeted investments in medical and computer science education, as well as a significant backfill of lost tuition revenue from a reduction in the 2016 tuition rate for resident undergraduate students. During the previous biennium, in exchange for biennial increases in state funding affecting both fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the University committed to freezing tuition rates for resident undergraduate students in both years. The University's Board of Regents continues to have broad tuition and fee setting authority for categories other than resident undergraduate tuition. State funding for capital appropriations continues to be under pressure, though some state bonding capacity was provided this biennium for critical renovation projects. Since 2009, Federal ARRA funding for basic research and activities in the health sciences has totaled $366 million. The University has $17 million of unspent ARRA awards that will be expended in fiscal year 2016 or later. The federal budget remains under significant pressure; ongoing federal funding for research could be impacted. In 2014, UW Medicine formed an Accountable Care Network (ACN) with certain other health care organizations and healthcare professionals in Western Washington. The ACN has entered into agreements to provide health care services to a UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 4 Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statements Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS(in millions) 2015 2014 Current assets $ 1,402 $ 1,537 Noncurrent assets: Capital assets, net 4,172 4,045 net of current portion 4,297 3,959 Other 491 358 Total assets 10,362 9,899 Deferred outflows 111 14 Total assets and deferred outflows 10,473 9,913 Current liabilities 998 872 Noncurrent liabilities:Bonds 1,249 432 Total liabilities 4,158 3,270 Deferred inflows 269 - Total liabilities and deferred Inflows 4,427 3,270 Net position $ 6,046 $ 6,643 (CONTINUED) large local employer with coverage that began January 2015, and with the Washington Health Care Authority to participate in its new Puget Sound Accountable Care Program (ACP) for Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) members. The Puget Sound ACP will initially be offered to PEBB members in five Western Washington counties beginning in January 2016, with possible statewide expansion in 2017. These arrangements include provisions for shared risk as well as shared savings between the ACN and the contracted entity based on achieving certain agreed upon quality and financial benchmarks. Rising benefit costs, particularly for pensions and healthcare, continue to impact the University as well. Employer pension funding rates for the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) pension plans were unchanged during fiscal year 2015, but will be increasing 19% to 11% of covered salary during fiscal year 2016. Likewise, although the monthly employer base rate paid by the University for employee healthcare decreased during fiscal year 2015, it will be increasing 27% to $840 per active employee during fiscal year 2016. Both rates are likely to continue increasing over the next few years. Using the Financial Statements The University's financial statements include the Statements of Net Position, the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, the Statement of Cash Flows and the Notes to the Financial Statements. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with GASB principles, which establish standards for external financial reporting for public colleges and universities. GASB standards require that financial statements be presented on a consolidated basis in order to focus on the University as a whole. On January 1, 2010, the University affiliated with Northwest Hospital & Medical Center (Northwest Hospital). GASB standards require that this entity be presented as a discrete component unit; therefore, its financial position at June 30, 2015, and the results of its operations for the year ended June 30, 2015, are included with Valley Medical Center in a separate column for financial statement presentation purposes (see Note 1 and Note 18 to the Financial Statements). On July 1, 2011, the University affiliated with Valley Medical Center, a Washington public hospital district which owns and operates a 321-bed full-service acute care hospital and 45 clinics located throughout southeast King County. Valley Medical Center is also being reflected as a discrete component unit; therefore its financial position and the results of its operations are included with Northwest Hospital in a separate column for financial statement presentation purposes (see Note 1 and Note 18 to the Financial Statements). The analysis presented below includes the consolidated balances of the University of Washington and its blended component units (see Note 1), but excludes the financial position and results of operations of its discrete component units (Northwest Hospital and Valley Medical Center), unless otherwise noted.The excess of current assets over current liabilities of $404 million in 2015 and $665 million in 2014 reflects the continuing ability of the University to meet its short-term obligations. Current assets consist primarily of cash, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Current assets decreased $135 million in 2015, due to a decrease in the value of short-term investments, and the receipt of funds from Sound Transit for the mitigation of costs resulting from the construction of the light rail tunnel beneath campus. The Sound Transit amount was reflected as a receivable at the end of fiscal year 2014. Long-term investments, a component of noncurrent assets, increased $338 million during 2015, as a result of market value changes during the year for the University's investments. Realized and unrealized gains in fiscal year 2015 totaled $151 million, versus $398 million in 2014. Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources both increased in 2015, primarily due to the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68. The University recorded $86 million of pension-related deferred outflows at the end of fiscal year 2015, primarily representing the deferral of pension contributions paid during the year for the University's participation in cost-sharing, defined benefit pension plans administered by the DRS. In addition, $269 million of pension-related deferred inflows were recorded for the University's proportionate share of collective deferred inflows reported by the DRS. These deferred inflow amounts represent the difference between projected and actual investment earnings on pension plan assets during the measurement period.Financial Health STATEMENTS OF NET POSITION The Statements of Net Position present the financial condition of the University and report a snapshot of assets, liabilities, deferrals and net position. A summarized comparison of these balances as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, follows:FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 5 Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statements(in millions) 2015 2014 Net investment in capital assets $ $ 2,018 net position $ 6,046 $ 6,643 1 The sum of Unrestricted Net Position and Restricted Expendable Net Position, divided by Total Operating Expenses (Operating Expenses plus interest expense).

As of June 30, 2015, a net pension liability of $623 million has been recorded and represents the University's proportionate share of the collective net pension liability reported by the DRS. The difference between total assets and deferred outflows, and total liabilities and deferred inflows, is referred to as net position or \"equity,\" and is one indicator of the current financial condition of the University. The change in net position measures whether the overall financial condition has improved or deteriorated during the year. The University reports its \"equity\" in four categories: Net Investment in Capital Assets - This is the University's total investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and outstanding debt obligations related to those capital assets; Restricted Net Position:- Nonexpendable net position, primarily endowments, consists of funds on which the donor or other external party has imposed the restriction that the corpus is not available for expenditures but rather for investment purposes only; - Expendable net position consists of resources which the University is legally or contractually obligated to spend in accordance with time or purpose restrictions placed by donors and/or other external parties; Unrestricted Net Position - This is all other funds available to the University for any purpose associated with its mission. Unrestricted net position is often internally designated for specific purposes. The University's net position at June 30, 2015 and 2014 is summarized as follows:restricted investments, including endowments. The increase in market value for the Consolidated Endowment Fund was the main reason for the increase. Unrestricted net position decreased by $870 million, or 50%, in 2015, primarily due to the impact of restating fiscal year 2015 beginning net position as a result of implementing GASB Statement No. 68. The change in accounting treatment required by Statement No. 68 reduced unrestricted net position by $913 million, representing the University's proportionate share of the beginning net pension liability, less $81 million of pension plan contributions paid by the University in the prior fiscal year. In addition, during fiscal year 2015 the University began a formal program to fund the construction of capital assets using internal reserves, by directing that a limited portion of the Invested Funds Pool be available for investment in institutional infrastructure, as opposed to financial assets. As a result, $51 million of construction costs associated with Phase 2 of the UW Medical Center Montlake Tower, and $77 million of costs associated with the construction of new student housing, were sourced during 2015 using internal reserves. These amounts have been reflected as a reduction of unrestricted net position, and an increase in net investment in capital assets. The ratio of expendable financial resources to operations (as defined by Moody's Investors Service) measures the strength of net position as the coverage of annual operating expenses by financial resources that are ultimately expendable. This ratio, illustrated in the chart below, shows that in 2015 the University had enough expendable resources from various sources to fund operations for a period of 7.4 months. The decrease in this ratio during 2015 is primarily due to the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68, and the resulting decrease in Unrestricted Net Position. Net investment in capital assets increased $138 million, or 7%, in 2015. This balance increases as debt is paid off, or when the University funds fixed asset purchases without the use of external financing, for example by using internal reserves. This balance decreases as assets are depreciated. Restricted nonexpendable net position increased $65 million, or 5%, in 2015. This increase primarily reflects the receipt of new endowment gifts during the year. Restricted expendable net position increased $70 million, or 4%, in 2015. This category is primarily affected by new operating and capital gifts, and earnings or losses on UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 6 Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statements Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS(CONTINUED) Consolidated Endowment Fund $1,800 $1,300 $800IN MILLIONS $1,700$2,098$2,161$2,168 $1,649$1,830$2,111$2,347$2,833$3,076 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Endowment and Other Investments Investment returns provide an important source of revenue for the University's programs. Among the funds invested by the University are endowments, operating reserves, life income trusts, annuities and gifts. Endowed gifts supply permanent capital and an ongoing stream of current earnings to the University. Most endowments are commingled in the Consolidated Endowment Fund (CEF), a diversified investment fund. As in a mutual fund, each individual endowment maintains a separate identity and owns units in the fund. The CEF has experienced considerable growth over the past 10 years due to new gifts and endowment returns. The number of individual endowments in the CEF has grown to 4,363 and the market value of the CEF has more than doubled, rising from $1.4 billion at June 30, 2005 to $3.1 billion at June 30, 2015. The impact to program support has been substantial, with $827 million distributed over the past 10 years touching every part of the University. Programs supported by endowment returns include academic programs, scholarships, fellowships, professorships, chairs and research activities. Under the Board of Regents' approved long-term spending policy for the CEF, quarterly distributions to programs are made based on an annual percentage rate of 4%, applied to the five-year rolling average of the CEF's market valuation. An additional 1% is distributed to support fundraising and stewardship activities (0.80%) and investment management (0.20%). Similar to program distributions, the fee is based on the endowment's five-year average market value. Endowment portfolios are commonly managed around a core set of objectives focused on the need to provide support for endowed programs in perpetuity. The Board of Regents, in conjunction with the University of Washington Investment Committee (UWINCO), establishes the policy asset allocation judged to be most appropriate for the University from a long-term potential return and risk perspective. The policy asset allocation is reviewed annually for its continuing fit with the University's risk profile and with consideration of the changing dynamics of the capital markets. The CEF asset allocation includes two clearly defined categories of investments: those which facilitate growth or appreciation (Capital Appreciation), and those which preserve endowment values (Capital Preservation). At June 30, 2015, 73% of the CEF was invested in Capital Appreciation and 27% in Capital Preservation. Following our expectation that market returns for equities will exceed bonds over the next decade, a medium-to-long-term objective of generally overweighting equity-oriented strategies with a focus on quality companies and downside protection is being maintained. The University also maintains ample liquidity within Capital Preservation to meet its funding requirements, as well as to take advantage of market dislocations if opportunities arise.For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the CEF earned an investment return of +6.8%, significantly outperforming the blended benchmark (70% MSCI ACWI and 30% BC Gov't Bond). All individual CEF strategies had strong relative performance against their benchmarks with the exception of Fixed Income, which underperformed. It was a mixed year for global equities with the US leading market returns, while international developed and emerging markets were both negative for the year as Europe and China struggled with economic and political headwinds. Despite this, the CEF's Emerging Market strategy performed well, posting gains of +11.0% for the year. With a five-year average of +10.0% and a ten-year average of +7.5%, the CEF has consistently maintained solid absolute and relative performance, outperforming the blended benchmark across all time periods. A portion of the University's operating funds are invested in the CEF. As of June 30, 2015, these funds comprise $806 million of the CEF market value. Debt and Related Capital Improvements The University's general revenue borrowing platform, established in 2003, has been used to fund buildings that support the educational, research and service missions of the institution. The University's debt portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate debt, including General Revenue Bonds, Lease Revenue Bonds and state issued bonds, as well as variable rate debt such as commercial paper. Credit ratings are a reflection of the University's strength. During fiscal year 2015, the University was rated Aaa (the highest rating) by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ (with FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 7 Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statements1.5% 8.010.014.0 6.04.02.0 1.3Expendable Financial Resources to Direct Debt2246 0PERCENTAGE 2015 20147.49.913.4 2015 2014 Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2014) Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2014)2015 2014Operating Margin3 2.3%9.5 Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2014)3.7% 2 The sum of Unrestricted Net Position and Restricted Expendable Net Position, divided by total capital lease obligations, bonds and notes payable outstanding.

These strong ratings carry substantial advantages for the University: continued and wider access to capital markets when the University issues debt, lower interest rates on bonds and the ability to negotiate favorable bond terms. The University takes its role of financial stewardship seriously and works hard to manage its financial resources effectively. Continued high debt ratings are important indicators of the University's success in this area. In March 2015, the University issued $218 million of General Revenue Bonds at an interest rate of 4.4%. Proceeds from this issuance refunded existing bonds and commercial paper. In September 2015, the University issued $196 million of General Revenue Bonds at an interest rate of 4.03%. A portion of the debt will be used to pay off $112 million of commercial paper. The balance will be used to fund various projects such as the renovation of Denny Hall, construction of the new Animal Care and Research Facility, the SW Campus Central Utilities Plant, and other projects. During fiscal year 2015, capital expenditures included $81 million for the construction of new student housing, and $62 million for Phase 2 of the UW Medical Center Montlake Tower.Key projects substantially completed in 2015 include: Demolition of the existing 1101 Caf\u00e9 building and Terry Hall, and the construction of two new residential buildings named Maple Hall and Terry Hall. These new eight-story residential buildings include five wood-frame stories of housing, above a concrete plinth, consisting of two-bedroom suites, all with private bathrooms. The lower two floors of each building will be occupied by Housing and Food Services administration offices, common space for students, and some additional two-bedroom suites. A below-grade parking garage connected to the Lander Hall garage and the Lander Hall loading dock will extend below the new Maple and Terry residence halls. The two new buildings will total approximately 440,000 square feet, with a target bed count of 1,150 beds. UW Medical Center Expansion Phase 2, which will provide a build-out of three inpatient bed floors, an OR suite within the new Montlake Tower (Phase I), and renovation of approximately 125,000 square feet within the existing Cascade and Pacific Towers. HR/Payroll Modernization, which is a major initiative to replace the University's 33-year-old legacy payroll system with a modern, integrated human resources and payroll system. HR/Payroll Modernization will also provide a set of standardized processes to significantly improve support for critical HR and payroll work across the University, including the Medical Centers. Construction of a new 3-story building adjacent to the existing North Creek Events Center on the UW Bothell and Cascadia Community College (CCC) campus. The 36,000 gross square feet facility will be used jointly by UW Bothell and CCC students, faculty, and staff. The Student Activities Center will provide for student leadership and clubs, fitness and recreation, casual study, and a multi-purpose room/events center. The project will also support the recently completed sports and recreation complex (adjacent to the project site) with restroom and equipment checkout facilities. One measure of the University's ability to repay debt is the ratio of expendable financial resources to debt. The 2015 ratio of expendable financial resources to debt (as defined by Moody's) shows that the University has sufficient expendable resources to pay its long-term debt obligations 1.3 times over. The decrease in this ratio during 2015 is primarily due to the implementation of GASB Statement No. 68, and the resulting decrease in Unrestricted Net Position.

In accordance with GASB reporting principles, revenues and expenses are classified as either operating or nonoperating. A condensed comparison of the University's revenues, expenses and changes in net position for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 follows: Grant Revenue One of the largest sources of revenue (27%) continues to be grants and contracts. Total grant revenue of $1,334 million in fiscal year 2015 is mostly unchanged from the prior year, as a slight decrease in receipts from federal sources was offset by increases in nongovernmental grant and contract revenue. Receipts from federal sponsors made up 75% of total grant and contract revenue in 2015, compared with 77% in 2014, due primarily to a decline in revenues from the National Institutes of Health. Revenues generated by federal ARRA research funding decreased to less than $1 million in fiscal year 2015, compared to $10 million in the prior year, and contributed to the decrease from federal sources. Grants and contracts provide the opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to work with nationally recognized faculty in research as part of their educational experience. Grant and contract revenue is earned when direct expenditures (such as researchers' compensation or purchases of goods and services) are made; therefore, there is little effect on the University's operating margin as a result of this direct expense reimbursement process. Facility and administrative (F&A) expenses necessary to support grants and contracts are reimbursed by sponsors, along with direct costs, by an indirect cost recovery. The current F&A, or indirect cost recovery rate, for research grants is approximately 29 cents on every direct expenditure dollar. Primary Nongrant Funding Sources The University relies primarily on student tuition and fees and state appropriations as revenue sources to support its nongrant funded educational operating expenses. State support for education increased during fiscal years 2014 and 2015, but is still significantly below historical levels.(in millions) 2015 2014 Tuition and fees $ 914 $ 839 Patient services 1,362 1,207 Grants and contracts 1,334 1,327 Sales and services of educational departments 223 213 Auxiliary enterprises 319 261 State funding for operations 255 262 Gifts 200 191 Investment income 227 481 State funding for capital projects 21 8 Other 128 164 Total revenue - all sources $ 4,983 $ 4,953(in millions) 2015 2014 Total operating revenues $ 4,217 $ 3,914 Total operating expenses 4,668 4,384 Operating loss (451) (470) Nonoperating revenues, net of expenses 576 859 Other revenues 110 89 Increase in net position 235 478 Net position, beginning of year 6,643 6,165 Cumulative effect of accounting change (832) - Net position, beginning of year as restated 5,811 6,165 Net position, end of year $ 6,046 $ 6,643 Sources of Funds 6% STATE FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES3% OTHER 27% PATIENT SERVICES 27% GRANTS AND CONTRACTS4% GIFTS4% SALES AND SERVICES OF EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENTS5% INVESTMENT INCOME 6% AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES18% TUITION AND FEES 24% INSTRUCTION 15% 7% AMORTIZATION2% OTHER 5% OPERATION & MAINTENANCE PLANT 5% INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 26% MEDICAL RELATEDUses of FundsNonoperating revenues decreased $283 million, or 33%, in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in investment income during the year resulting from decreased investment market values. The University has a diversified revenue base. No single source generated more than 27% of the total fiscal year 2015 revenues of $5.0 billion. The following table summarizes revenues from all sources for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 9 Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statementsNoncapital state appropriations are considered nonoperating revenue under GASB Statement No. 35, \"Basic Financial Statements - and Management's Discussion and Analysis - for Public Colleges and Universities,\" and are reflected in the nonoperating section of the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position; however, they are used solely for operating purposes. Tuition and fees, net of scholarship allowances, increased $75 million (9%) to $914 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher enrollment during the year for most enrollment categories, together with selective increases in some tuition rates, mainly for non-resident students. Tuition increases were partially offset by an increase in scholarships and fellowships, and scholarship allowances of $11 million in 2015. Self-sustaining educational programs (fee-supported programs) include the following amounts for each of the fiscal years 2015 and 2014: UW Educational Outreach (the continuing education branch of the University), $97 million and $96 million, respectively, summer quarter tuition $59 million and $42 million, respectively, and for Business School and School of Medicine programs $47 million and $45 million, respectively. Patient Services - UW Medicine The financial statements of the University include the operations of the School of Medicine, three hospitals, associated physicians and clinics, Airlift Northwest, and the University's share of two joint ventures. These entities, together with Harborview Medical Center (not included in the University's financial statements\u2014see Note 13) comprise UW Medicine, an umbrella organization serving to coordinate these activities and promote quality healthcare in the Pacific Northwest and beyond, and to conduct cutting-edge medical research with worldwide benefit. Patient care activities included in the University's financial statements include: UW Medical Center (UWMC) is a 450-bed hospital that provides comprehensive healthcare services to the Puget Sound community and patients from throughout the Pacific Northwest. UWMC also serves as the major clinical, teaching and research site for students and faculty in the Health Sciences at the University. Over 18,000 patients receive inpatient care at UWMC each year. Specialized inpatient care needs are met by the Cancer Center, the Regional Heart Center, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and the Organ Transplantation program. Strategic growth initiatives were implemented in FY14 with the expansion of primary care and urgent care, the opening of the Eastside Specialty Center and other clinics, as well as continued progress on Phase 2 of the UW Medical Center Montlake Tower. Valley Medical Center (VMC) is a 321-bed acute care hospital and network of clinics, treats over 17,000 inpatients per year, and is the oldest and largest public district hospital in the state of Washington. VMC joined UW Medicine in July 2011. VMC's Statement of Net Position and Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position are presented in a discrete column together with NWH on the financial statements of the University. Northwest Hospital & Medical Center (NWH) is a full-service medical facility with 281 beds, and treats approximately 10,000 inpatients per year. NWH joined UW Medicine in January 2010. NWH's Statement of Net Position and Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position are presented in a discrete column together with VMC on the financial statements of the University. UW Neighborhood Clinics (Neighborhood Clinics) is a network of primary care clinics with ten neighborhood locations throughout the greater Seattle area, providing primary care, urgent care and selected specialty care with a staff of approximately 85 healthcare providers. The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of Neighborhood Clinics are included in the University's financial statements. UW Physicians (UWP) is the physician practice group for more than 1,800 faculty physicians and healthcare providers associated with UW Medicine. The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of UWP are included in the University's financial statements. Airlift Northwest is the preeminent provider of air medical transport services in the Pacific Northwest. The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of Airlift Northwest are included in the University's financial statements. The University is also a participant in two joint ventures: Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Children's University Medical Group. The University's share of these activities is reflected in the University's financial statements. In combination, these organizations (not including VMC and NWH) contributed $1,362 million in patient services revenue in fiscal year 2015, of which 76% was generated by UWMC. This compares to $1,207 million in patient services revenue in fiscal year 2014, of which 77% was generated by UWMC. UWMC admissions exceeded 18,000 in 2015, a slight increase from 2014. Average patient length of stay was nearly 7.0 days, up from 6.9 days in 2014. The increase in patient services revenue during 2015 is partly due to higher case acuity at UWMC, as well as strong case volumes in oncology, cardiology and neurosurgery. Charity care has decreased as a result of the Medicaid expansion and implementation of the Healthcare Exchanges effective January 1, 2014. While patients continue to be treated from all walks of life, the number of uninsured patients served at UW Medicine has declined and been accompanied by an increase in Medicaid patients.UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 10 Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statements Unaudited - see accompanying notes to basic financial statementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS(CONTINUED) (in millions) 2015 2014 Operating expenses: Educational and general instruction $ 1,114 $ 1,037 Research 730 766 Public service 35 42 Academic support 337 297 Student services 43 43 Institutional support 215 224 Operation and maintenance of plant 241 201 Scholarships and fellowships 147 138 Auxiliary enterprises 292 286 Medical-related 1,203 1,042 Depreciation/amortization 311 308 Total operating expenses $ 4,668 $ 4,384A comparative summary of the University's expenses by functional classification (purpose for which the costs are incurred) for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 follows: Gifts, Endowments and Investment Revenues Net investment returns for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following: (in millions) 2015 2014 Interest and dividends $ 66 $ 73 Metropolitan tract net income 16 8 Investment in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance 6 12 Net appreciation of fair value of investments 151 398 Investment expenses (12) (10) Net investment income $ 227 $ 481 Sources of Funds 6% STATE FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES3% OTHER 27% PATIENT SERVICES 27% GRANTS AND CONTRACTS4% GIFTS4% SALES AND SERVICES OF EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENTS5% INVESTMENT INCOME 6% AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES18% TUITION AND FEES 24% INSTRUCTION 15% 7% AMORTIZATION2% OTHER 5% OPERATION & MAINTENANCE PLANT 5% INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 26% MEDICAL RELATEDUses of FundsNet appreciation includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses. The unrealized gains, however, are not available until the underlying securities have been sold. Net investment income decreased by $254 million in 2015. The change in realized and unrealized gains and losses was the major factor in the variance. Donor support increased by $9 million, or 5%, to $200 million in 2015. Gifts are a key and necessary source of support for a variety of purposes including capital improvements, scholarships, research, and endowments for various academic and research positions. Expenses Two primary functions of the University, instruction and research, comprised 39% of total operating expenses. These amounts provided instruction to nearly 55,000 students and funded 5,000 research awards. Medical-related expenses, such as those related to patient care, also continue to be one of the largest individual components.Overall, the University's operating expenses increased by $284 million, or 6%, over 2014. Salaries expense increased $166 million, or 8% due to employee merit increases and a modest increase in FTE's. Despite an increase in the associated salaries, benefits expense decreased by $12 million, or 2%, due primarily to a reduction in pension expense as calculated under GASB Statement No. 68. In accordance with Statement No. 68, the difference between projected and actual investment earnings on plan assets during the measurement period for the net pension liability has been recorded as a deferred inflow and is being amortized to pension expense over five years. The University's proportionate share of that amortization reduced fiscal year 2015 pension expense by $67 million. Supplies and materials expense increased $44 million, or 11%, partly due to higher demand for medical supplies required by UWMC to support an increase in volumes related to patient care. Other operating expense increased by $35 million, or 34%, primarily due to increases in rental expense and costs associated with the University's self-insurance program.FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 11 Unaudited - see notes to basic financial statements1.5% 8.010.014.0 6.04.02.0 1.3Expendable Financial Resources to Direct Debt2246 0PERCENTAGE 2015 20147.49.913.4 2015 2014 Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2014) Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2014)2015 2014Operating Margin3 2.3%9.5 Moody's Public Universities (Aaa median 2014)3.7% 3 Operating loss, (including interest expense, operating appropriations, nonoperating federal grants, an assumed 5% spending rate on investments and nonpermanent endowment gifts), divided by operating revenues (less scholarship expenses, and including operating appropriations, nonoperating federal grants, an assumed 5% return on investments and nonpermanent endowment gifts). Excludes Northwest Hospital and Valley Medical Center.Operating Loss The University's operating loss decreased slightly to $451 million in 2015, from $470 million in 2014. State appropriations are shown as nonoperating revenue, pursuant to GASB standards. If state appropriations were classified as operating revenue, the operating loss would have been $196 million in 2015, and $208 million in 2014. The University continues to rely on nonoperating revenues such as gift revenues and investment income distributions, in addition to state appropriations, to fund its operations. Operating Margin Moody's measures the net result of revenue and expense activity by including several nonoperating revenues in the margin. The 2015 operating margin increased to 2.3%. Operating margin calculations include an estimated return on the University's investments rather than actual investment income. Therefore, variances in investment performance in a given year will not impact the operating margin.UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 12STATEMENTS OF NET POSITIONUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON DISCRETE COMPONENT UNITS 1 ASSETS AND DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES CURRENT ASSETS: CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (NOTE 2) $ 82,905 $ 39,960 INVESTMENTS, CURRENT PORTION (NOTE 6) 679,505 24,477 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (NET OF ALLOWANCE OF $66,902) (NOTE 5) 596,453 110,297 OTHER CURRENT CURRENT ASSETS 1,402,322 238,178 NONCURRENT ASSETS: DEPOSIT WITH STATE OF WASHINGTON (NOTE 3) 51,647 - INVESTMENTS, NET OF CURRENT PORTION (NOTE 6) 4,297,157 66,168 METROPOLITAN TRACT (NOTE 7) 121,146 - STUDENT LOANS RECEIVABLE (NET OF ALLOWANCE OF $4,974) (NOTE 4) 73,384 - DUE FROM DISCRETE COMPONENT UNITS 93,240 - OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS 150,323 110,753 CAPITAL ASSETS (NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION OF $3,566,289) (NOTE 8) 4,172,378 467,701 TOTAL NONCURRENT ASSETS ASSETS 10,361,597 882,800 DEFERRED OUTFLOWS RESOURCES: UNAMORTIZED LOSS ON BOND REFUNDING 25,813 6,435 PENSION-RELATED DEFERRED OUTFLOWS (NOTE 15) 85,602 - TOTAL DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES 111,415 6,435 TOTAL ASSETS AND DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES $ 10,473,012 $ 889,235 LIABILITIES AND DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES CURRENT LIABILITIES: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES $ 626,085 $ 121,160 UNEARNED REVENUES 155,114 - OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 11,743 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, CURRENT PORTION (NOTES GOVERNMENT GRANTS REFUNDABLE 51,985 - DUE TO PRIMARY GOVERNMENT - 93,240 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, NET OF CURRENT PORTION (NOTES 9-11) 2,484,522 320,232 NET PENSION LIABILITY (NOTE 15) 622,589 NONCURRENT LIABILITIES 3,159,096 413,472 TOTAL LIABILITIES 4,157,414 DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES: PROPERTY TAXES - 9,625 PENSION-RELATED DEFERRED INFLOWS (NOTE 15) 269,135 - TOTAL DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES 269,135 9,625 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES 4,426,549 565,001 NET POSITION NET INVESTMENT IN POSITION 6,046,463 324,234 TOTAL LIABILITIES, DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES AND NET POSITION $ 10,473,012 $ 889,235 UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 1 See Note 18 See accompanying notes to basic financial statements.

Dollars in thousandsNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 16 NOTE 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies FINANCIAL REPORTING ENTITY The University of Washington (University), an agency of the state of Washington, is governed by a 10-member Board of Regents appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate. The financial statements include the individual schools, colleges and departments of the University, the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Portage Bay Insurance (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the University) and certain affiliated operations determined to be a part of the University's financial reporting entity. Affiliated organizations are evaluated for inclusion in the reporting entity as component units based on the significance of their relationship with the University. Harborview Medical Center (HMC), a component unit of King County, Washington, is a related party to the University, but is not reflected as part of the financial reporting entity (Note 13). Component units are legally separate organizations for which the University is financially accountable. These entities may be reported in the financial statements of the primary government in one of two ways: the component units' amounts may be blended with the amounts reported by the primary government, or they may be shown in a separate column, depending on the application of the criteria of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 61, \"The Financial Reporting Entity: Omnibus.\" All component units of the University meet the criteria for blending except Northwest Hospital & Medical Center and Valley Medical Center. They are reported discretely, since they have separate boards of directors and they do not provide services exclusively to the University. BLENDED COMPONENT UNITS The following entities are presented as blended component units because they provide service exclusively or almost exclusively to the University. Financial information for these affiliated organizations is available from their respective administrative offices. The Association of University Physicians dba UW Physicians (UWP) UWP was established as a tax-exempt entity for the exclusive benefit of the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM). UWP employs UWSOM faculty and bills and collects for their clinical services as an agent for UWSOM. UWP had operating revenues of $204,079,000 in 2015. UW Medicine Neighborhood Clinics (Neighborhood Clinics) Neighborhood Clinics was established as a tax-exempt entity for the benefit of UWSOM, UWP and its affiliated medical centers, HMC and UWMC, exclusively for charitable, scientific and educational purposes. Neighborhood Clinics was organized to coordinate and develop patient care in a community clinical setting. They enhance the academic environment of UWSOM by providing additional sites of primary care practice and training for faculty, residents and students. Neighborhood Clinics had operating revenues of $16,008,000 in 2015. Real estate financing entities The entities listed below are nonprofit corporations that were formed to acquire, construct or renovate certain real properties for the benefit of the University in fulfilling its educational, medical or scientific research missions. These entities issue tax-exempt and taxable bonds to finance these activities. Washington Biomedical Research Properties I Washington Biomedical Research Properties II Washington Biomedical Research Facilities 3 These entities collectively have net capital assets of $278,928,000, and long-term debt of $281,550,000, in 2015. These amounts are reflected in the University's financial statements. DISCRETELY PRESENTED COMPONENT UNITS Northwest Hospital UW Medicine and Northwest Hospital & Medical Center (NWH), a 281-bed full-service acute care hospital, entered into an affiliation agreement effective January 1, 2010.

The SCCA integrates the cancer research, teaching and clinical cancer programs of all three institutions to provide state-of-the-art cancer care. Each member of the SCCA has a one-third interest. The University accounts for its interest in SCCA under the equity method and has recorded $107,704,000 in Other Assets, together with $6,319,000 in Investment Income, for its share of the joint venture in 2015. The University and Seattle Children's Hospital established Children's University Medical Group (CUMG) to assist the organizations in carrying out their pediatric patient care, charitable, educational, and scientific missions. CUMG employs UWSOM faculty physicians, and bills and collects for their services as an agent for UWSOM. The University records revenue from CUMG based on the income distribution plan effective December 31, 2008. The University's patient services receivable (Note 5) includes amounts due from CUMG of $18,852,000 in 2015. CHANGES IN REPORTING ENTITY In fiscal year 2015, the University paid the remaining outstanding principal balance on the TSB Properties Lease Revenue Bonds, 2006, and title to the property was passed to the University. The entity that issued the leased-backed bonds, TSB Properties, was dissolved and is no longer a blended component unit of the University. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The financial statements of the University have been prepared in accordance with GASB Statement No. 34, \"Basic Financial Statements \u2014 and Management's Discussion and Analysis \u2014 for State and Local Governments,\" as amended by GASB Statement No. 35, \"Basic Financial Statements \u2014 and Management's Discussion and Analysis \u2014 for Public Colleges and Universities.\" The University is reporting as a special-purpose government engaged in business-type activities (BTA). In accordance with BTA reporting, the University presents management's discussion and analysis, statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses and changes in net position, statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements. The financial statements are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation has been incurred. All intra-agency transactions have been eliminated. The University reports capital assets net of accumulated depreciation/amortization (as applicable), and reports depreciation/amortization expense in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position. On July 1, 2014, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 68, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions.\" This Statement requires governments providing defined benefit pensions to their employees to recognize their proportionate share of the pension plan's net pension liability or net pension asset, which is measured as the total pension liability less the amount of the pension plan's fiduciary net position. The total pension liability is determined by discounting projected benefit payments based on the benefit terms and legal agreements existing at the pension plan's fiscal year end. Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted using a single rate that reflects the expected rate of return on investments, to the extent that plan assets are available to pay benefits. When plan assets are insufficient to pay benefits, the discount rate used is a blended rate comprised of the expected rate of return over the period when projected plan assets exist to pay benefits, and then a tax-exempt, high-quality municipal bond rate for the periods when projected plan assets are not available. This Statement requires that most changes in the net pension liability be included in pension expense in the period of the change. Prior to adopting this Statement, the University reported pension expense based on cash contributions paid to the pension plan administrator. In addition to the reporting changes described above, implementation of this Statement resulted in the restatement of fiscal year 2015 beginning unrestricted net position, reducing it by $831,426,000. The University's Statement of Net Position, Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, and the Statement of Cash Flows present only one fiscal year, since the change in accounting treatment required by Statement No. 68 is not able to be applied to the prior fiscal year due to the constraints of available information. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 18 (CONTINUED) With the adoption of GASB Statement No. 68, net position was restated at July 1, 2014. Below is a reconciliation of total net position as previously reported at June 30, 2014, to the restated net position. (Dollars in thousands) NET POSITION AT JUNE 30, 2014, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED $ 6,642,549 ADOPTION OF GASB STATEMENT NO. 68 (831,426) NET POSITION AT JULY 1, 2014, AS RESTATED $ 5,811,123 On July 1, 2014, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 69, \"Government Combinations and Disposals of Government Operations.\" This Statement requires disclosures to be made about government combinations and disposals of government operations, in order to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of those transactions. There was no impact to the financial statements of the University as a result of implementing this Statement. On July 1, 2014, the University adopted GASB Statement No. 71, \"Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date,\" an amendment of GASB Statement No. 68, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions.\" The purpose of this Statement is to address application of the transition provisions of GASB Statement No. 68, and clarify guidance regarding contributions made by a state or local government employer, or nonemployer contributing entity, to a defined benefit pension plan after the measurement date of the government's beginning net pension liability. Implementation of this Statement reduced the restatement of beginning unrestricted net position resulting from GASB Statement No. 68 by $80,926,000. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IMPACTING THE FUTURE In February 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 72, \"Fair Value Measurement and Application\", which will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. This Statement provides guidance for determining a fair value measurement for financial reporting purposes. This Statement also provides guidance for applying fair value to certain investments, and disclosures related to all fair value measurements. This Statement establishes a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, and requires disclosures to be made about fair value measurements, the level of fair value hierarchy, and valuation techniques. The University is currently analyzing the impact of this Statement. In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 73, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions and Related Assets That Are Not within the Scope of GASB Statement 68, and Amendments to Certain Provisions of GASB Statements 67 and 68\". Amendments to Statement No. 68 will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 and the guidance for plans not within the scope of Statement No. 68 will be effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. This Statement is intended to improve financial reporting of governments whose employees are provided with pensions that are not within the scope of Statement No. 68, improve the usefulness of information associated with governments that hold assets accumulated for purposes of providing defined benefit pensions not within the scope of Statement No. 68, and to clarify the application of certain provisions of Statements No. 67 & 68. The University is currently analyzing the impact of this Statement. In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 74, \"Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans\", which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The objective of this Statement is to improve the usefulness of information about other postemployment benefits (OPEB) such as death benefits, life insurance, disability, and long-term care in the financial reports of governments that provide them. This Statement replaces Statement No. 43, \"Financial Reporting for Post-employment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans, as amended.\" The University is currently analyzing the applicability of this Statement. In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 75, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions\", which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. This Statement establishes standards of accounting and financial reporting for defined benefit OPEB and defined contribution OPEB that are provided to the employees of state and local governmental employers through OPEB plans that are administered through trusts or equivalent arrangements. This Statement also establishes standards of accounting and financial reporting for OPEB plans that are not administered through trusts or equivalent arrangements. The University is currently analyzing the impact of this Statement. In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 76, \"The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for State and Local Governments\", which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016. The objective of this Statement is to identify the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This Statement reduces the GAAP hierarchy to two categories of authoritative GAAP, and addresses the use of authoritative and nonauthoritative literature in the event that the accounting treatment for a transaction or other event is not specified within a source of authoritative GAAP. The University is currently analyzing the impact of this Statement.FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 19In August 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. 77, \"Tax Abatement Disclosures\", which is effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. This Statement defines a tax abatement as resulting from an agreement between a government and an individual or entity in which the government promises to forgo tax revenues, and the individual or entity promises to subsequently take a specific action that contributes to economic development or otherwise benefits the government or its citizens. This Statement requires governments that enter into tax abatement agreements to disclose information about the agreements. The University is currently analyzing the impact of this Statement. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles involves management estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, deferrals, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates; however, in each case, the University believes that allowances, reserves and estimates of expected liabilities are adequate. The University estimates the pollution remediation liability (Note 9) by reviewing the current status of known polluted sites and developing estimates of cleanup costs. These estimates are subject to change due to improvements in technology, inflation, changes in the scope of work, and the pursuit of reimbursement from other responsible parties. Allowances (Notes 4 and 5) are estimates based on the historical experience of the University and current economic circumstances with respect to the collectability of accounts and loans receivable. The University's share of pension plan assets, liabilities, deferrals and expenses related to the plans administered by the Washington Department of Retirement Systems, and the liability and expense related to the University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan (Note 15), reported in the University's financial statements are based on actuarial valuations prepared by an external actuary. The results of an actuarial valuation are estimates based on historical data, actuarial assumptions, and the demographics of the employee population. The self-insurance reserve (Note 16) is estimated through an externally prepared actuarial calculation using individual case-basis valuations and statistical analyses. Considerable variability is inherent in such estimates. OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES Investments. Investments are generally carried at fair value. The fair value of all debt and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value is based on quotations from major securities exchanges. Alternative investments, which are not readily marketable, are carried at the estimated fair values provided by the investment managers. The University reviews and evaluates the values provided by the investment managers and agrees with the valuation methods and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the alternative investments. Those estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these securities existed. Investments held to satisfy long-term strategies are considered noncurrent. Short-term investments consist primarily of cash equivalents and fixed income vehicles which management has identified as available to meet the day-to-day obligations of the University. Inventories. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and reflected on the Statement of Net Position in Other Current Assets. Consumable inventories, consisting of expendable materials and supplies, are generally valued using the weighted-average method. Merchandise inventories are generally valued using the first-in, first-out method. Capital Assets. Land, buildings, equipment, library books and intangibles are stated at cost or, if acquired by gift, at fair market value at the date of the gift. Additions, replacements, major repairs and renovations are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 15 to 50 years for building components, 20 to 50 years for infrastructure and land improvements, 5 to 7 years for equipment, 15 years for library books, and 3 to 15 years for intangibles. Interest incurred on capital asset-related debt was $86,931,000 during 2015. The University capitalized $7,672,000 of this cost during 2015 in accordance with GASB code 1400.120-.137. Unearned Revenues. Unearned revenues occur when funds have been collected in advance of when the associated goods or services have been provided, such as advance ticket sales, summer quarter tuition and unspent cash advances on certain grants. Cost-Sharing Pension Plans. The net pension asset or liability is measured as the University's proportionate share of the collective total pension liability, less the fiduciary net position, of the cost-sharing pension plans in which the University participates. The total pension liability is determined based upon discounting projected benefit payments based on the NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 20 benefit terms and legal agreements existing at the pension plan's fiscal year end. Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted using a single rate that reflects the expected rate of return on investments, to the extent that plan assets are available to pay benefits. When plan assets are insufficient to pay benefits, the discount rate used is a blended rate comprised of the expected rate of return over the period when projected plan assets exist to pay benefits, and then a tax-exempt, high-quality municipal bond rate for the periods when projected plan assets are not available. The University's proportionate share is determined based on the relationship of University contributions to total contributions to the plan by all participating employers. Pension expense is recognized for benefits earned during the period, interest on the unfunded liability and changes in benefit terms. Differences between expected and actual experience, and changes in assumptions about future economic or demographic factors, are reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources, and are recognized over the average expected remaining service period for employees eligible for pension benefits. Differences between expected and actual investment returns are reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources, and are recognized over five years. Contributions made to the plan subsequent to the measurement date and prior to the University's fiscal year end are reported as a deferred outflow of resources, and recognized in the subsequent fiscal year. The measurement date for the cost-sharing plans in which the University participates is June 30 of the prior fiscal year. Split-Interest Agreements. Under such agreements, donors/beneficiaries receive income for their lifetime or for a stated term, with the University receiving the remaining principal. The University records an asset related to these agreements at fair market value at year-end. The University also records a liability related to the split-interest agreements equal to the present value of expected future distributions; the discount rates applied range from 3.7% to 8.0%. Compensated Absences. University employees accrue annual leave at rates based on length of service, and for sick leave at the rate of one day per month. Sick leave balances, which are unlimited, can be converted to monetary compensation annually at 25% of the employees' normal compensation rate for any balance that exceeds 480 hours, or for any balance upon retirement or death. Annual leave accrued at June 30, 2015 was $93,328,000, and is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. Sick leave accrued as of June 30, 2015 was $37,984,000, and is included in Long-Term Liabilities (Note 9). Scholarship Allowances. Tuition and Fees are reported net of scholarship allowances that are applied to students' accounts from external funds that have already been recognized as revenue by the University. Student aid paid directly to students is reported as scholarships and fellowships expense. Net Patient Services Revenue. Patient services revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payors. Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Revenue related to charity care provided to patients is excluded from net patient services revenue. Third-party payor agreements with Medicare and Medicaid provide for payments at amounts different from established rates and are part of contractual adjustments to net patient services revenue. Medicare reimbursements are based on a tentative rate, with final settlement determined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by the Medicare fiscal intermediary. The estimated final settlements for open years are based on preliminary cost findings after giving consideration to interim payments that have been received on behalf of patients covered under these programs. For more information about UWMC operations and financial results, see their audited financial statements which are contained in the latest Bondholders Report at http://f2.washington.edu/treasury/sites/default/UW_BondholdersReport_ 15.pdf. Charity Care. Based on established rates, the charges for patient services forgone as a result of charity care during the year ended June 30, 2015 were $31,915,000.The cost of charity care is estimated based on the ratio of the cost of providing care to the value of the charges forgone. Applying this ratio results in an estimated cost of charity care and uncompensated care of $11,530,000 in fiscal year 2015. State Appropriations. The state of Washington appropriates funds to the University on both annual and biennial bases. These revenues are reported as nonoperating revenues in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position.Operating Activities. The University's policy for reporting operating activities in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position is to include activities that generally result from exchange transactions. Examples of exchange transactions are payments received for tuition, patient services or grants under which services are performed, as well as payments made for the delivery of goods or services. Certain other significant revenue streams used for operations, such as state appropriations, Pell grants, gifts and investment income are recorded as nonoperating revenues, as prescribed by GASB Statement No. 35.(CONTINUED)FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 21Net Position. The University's net position is classified as follows: Net investment in capital assets: The University's investments in capital assets, less accumulated depreciation/amortization, net of outstanding debt obligations related to capital assets; Restricted net position - nonexpendable: Net position subject to externally-imposed requirements that it be maintained permanently by the University, including permanent endowment funds and annuity and life income trusts;Restricted net position - expendable: Net position that the University is obligated to spend in accordance with restrictions imposed by external parties, generally for scholarships, research and departmental uses;Unrestricted net position: Net position not subject to externally-imposed restrictions and which may be designated for specific purposes by management or the Board of Regents.Tax Exemption. The University, as an agency of the state of Washington, is not subject to federal income tax pursuant to Section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code, except for tax on unrelated business income and certain federal excise taxes. NOTE 2: Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash on hand, petty cash and bank deposits. Most cash, except for cash held at the University and cash held in foreign banks, is covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), or if greater than FDIC limits, by collateral held in a multiple financial institution collateral pool administered by the Washington Public Deposit Protection Commission (PDPC). At June 30, 2015, bank balances of $108,423,000 were either insured by the FDIC or collateralized under the PDPC. NOTE 3: Deposit with State of Washington State law requires the University to deposit certain funds with the state treasurer, who holds and invests the funds. These deposits include amounts held for the University's permanent land grant funds, and the University of Washington building fee collected from students. The fair value of these funds approximates the carrying value. NOTE 4: Student Loans Receivable Net student loans of $73,384,000 at June 30, 2015 consist of $55,537,000 from federal programs and $17,847,000 from University programs. Interest income from student loans for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $1,690,000. These unsecured loans are made primarily to students who reside in the state of Washington. NOTE 5: Accounts Receivable The major components of accounts receivable as of June 30, 2015 were: (Dollars in thousands) 2015 NET PATIENT SERVICES $ 325,813 GRANTS AND CONTRACTS 179,621 SALES AND SERVICES 30,753 TUITION 12,094 DUE FROM OTHER AGENCIES 47,851 ROYALTIES APPROPRIATIONS 5,930 ALLOWANCE DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (66,902) TOTAL $ 596,453NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 22 NOTE 6: Investments INVESTMENTS - GENERAL The Board of Regents of the University of Washington is responsible for the management of the University's investments. The Board of Regents establishes investment policy, which is carried out by the Chief Investment Officer. The University of Washington Investment Committee, comprised of board members and investment professionals, advises on matters relating to the management of the University's investment portfolios. The composition of the carrying amounts of investments by type at June 30, 2015 is listed in Table 1.TABLE 1 - UNIVERSITY INVESTMENTS (Dollars in thousands) Carrying Value Investment Type 2015 FIXED INCOME - CASH EQUIVALENTS $ 403,978 FIXED INCOME 1,726,481 TOTAL INVESTMENTS $ 4,976,662 * Investment type includes private and other illiquid investments held in the Consolidated Endowment Fund INVESTMENT POOLS The University combines most short-term cash balances into the Invested Funds Pool. At June 30, 2015, the Invested Funds Pool totaled $1,526,380,000. The Invested Funds Pool also owns units in the Consolidated Endowment Fund (CEF) valued at $806,198,000 on June 30, 2015. By University policy, departments with qualifying funds in the Invested Funds Pool receive distributions based on their average balances and on the type of balance. Campus depositors received 2% in fiscal year 2015. Endowment operating and gift accounts received 3% in fiscal year 2015, with the distributions directed to the University. The difference between the actual earnings of the Invested Funds Pool and the calculated distributions is used to support activities benefiting all University departments. The majority of the endowed funds are invested in the CEF, a pooled fund. Individual endowments purchase units in the pool on the basis of a per-unit valuation of the CEF at fair value on the last business day of the calendar quarter. Income is distributed based on the number of units held. RCW 24.55 of the Washington State Code and the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act allow for total return expenditure under comprehensive prudent standards. Under the CEF spending policy approved by the Board of Regents, quarterly distributions to programs are based on an annual percentage rate of 4%, applied to the five-year rolling average of the CEF's market valuation. Additionally, the policy allows for an administrative fee of 1% supporting campus-wide fundraising and stewardship activities (0.80%) and offsetting the internal cost of managing endowment assets (0.20%). This policy was effective with the December 2010 quarterly distributions, with the five-year averaging period implemented incrementally. The University records its permanent endowments at the lower of original gift value or current market value in the Restricted Nonexpendable Net Position category. Of the endowments that are recorded at current market value, the net deficiency from the original gift value is $2,986,000 at June 30, 2015. Funds in irrevocable trusts managed by trustees other than the University are not reported in the financial statements. The fair value of these funds was $111,442,000 at June 30, 2015. Income received from these trusts, which is included in Investment Income, was $6,162,000 for the year ended June 30, 2015. Net appreciation (depreciation) in the fair value of investments includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. The University realized net gains of $71,485,000 in 2015 from the sale of investments. The calculation of realized gains and losses is independent of the net appreciation of the fair value of investments. Realized gains and losses on investments that have been held in more than one fiscal year and are sold in the current year include the net appreciation of these investments reported in the prior year(s). The net appreciation in the fair value of investments during the year ended June 30, 2015 was $151,209,000.(CONTINUED)FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 23FUNDING COMMITMENTS The University enters into contracts with investment managers to fund alternative investments. As of June 30, 2015, the University had outstanding commitments to fund alternative investments of $329,901,000. These commitments are expected to be called over a multi-year time frame. The University believes it has adequate liquidity and funding sources to meet these obligations. DERIVATIVES The University's investment policies allow investing in various derivative instruments, including futures, swaps and forwards, to manage exposures within or across the portfolio and to improve the portfolio's risk/return profile. Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset at a predetermined future date and price. Total return swaps involve commitments to pay interest in exchange for a market-linked return, both based on notional amounts. Derivative instruments are recorded on the contract date and are carried at fair value using listed price quotations or amounts that approximate fair value. The fair value and notional amount of investment derivative instruments outstanding at June 30, 2015, categorized by type, are as follows: TABLE 2 - INVESTMENT DERIVATIVES (Dollars in thousands) Notional Amount as of June 30 Fair Value as of June 30 Change in Fair Value DESCRIPTION 2015 ASSET CLASSIFICATION 2015 INCOME CLASSIFICATION 2015 FUTURES CONTRACTS $100,747 INVESTMENTS $100,286 INVESTMENT INCOME ($461) Credit exposure represents exposure to counterparties relating to financial instruments, where gains exceed collateral held by the University or losses are less than the collateral posted by the University. There was no credit exposure as of June 30, 2015. No derivative instruments have been reclassified from a hedging instrument to an investment instrument. Details on foreign currency derivatives are disclosed under Foreign Exchange Risk. INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of fixed income securities. The University manages interest rate risk through its investment policies and the investment guidelines established with each manager. Each fixed-income manager is assigned a maximum boundary for duration as compared to the manager's relevant benchmark index. The goal is to allow ample freedom for the manager to perform, while controlling the interest rate risk in the portfolio. Effective duration is a commonly used measure of interest rate risk. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the portfolio is to changes in interest rates. The weighted average effective duration of the University's fixed income portfolio was 1.81 years at June 30, 2015. CREDIT RISK Fixed income securities are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to a financial instrument will not fulfill its obligations or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make these payments will cause prices to decline. Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer. The University Investment Policies limit fixed income exposure to investment grade assets. The Investment Policy for the Invested Funds' cash pool requires each manager to maintain an average quality rating of \"AA\" as issued by a nationally recognized rating organization. The Invested Funds' liquidity pool requires each manager to maintain an average quality rating of \"A\" and to hold 25% of their portfolios in government and government agency issues. The Investment Policy for the CEF reflects its long-term nature by specifying average quality rating levels by individual manager, but still restricting investment to investment grade credits.

The University held non-U.S. denominated securities at June 30, 2015 of $1,195,070,000.(CONTINUED)FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 25NOTE 7: Metropolitan Tract The University of Washington Metropolitan Tract (\"the Metropolitan Tract\"), located in downtown Seattle, comprises approximately 11 acres of developed property, including office space, retail space, residential apartments, parking, and a luxury hotel. This land was the original site of the University from 1861 until 1895 when the University moved to its present location on Lake Washington. Since the early 1900s, the Metropolitan Tract has been leased by the University to entities responsible for developing and operating the property. The balance as of June 30, 2015 represents operating assets net of liabilities, and land, buildings and improvements stated at appraised value as of November 1, 1954. The balance also includes subsequent capital additions and improvements at cost, less retirements and accumulated depreciation of $166,124,000, and is net of the outstanding balance of the associated long-term debt. In March 2015, $8,500,000 of Metropolitan Tract commercial paper was refinanced and replaced by the issuance of University General Revenue and Refunding Bonds, 2015 A&B, as described in the refunding activity section of Note 11. The loan amount as of June 30, 2015 to the Metropolitan Tract under this agreement was $8,535,000. In addition, $33,400,000 of bond proceeds were loaned to the Metropolitan Tract as part of the Cobb Building lease termination. The loan amount as of June 30, 2015 under this agreement was $33,564,000. Both loans are unsecured, but expected to be repaid through revenues generated by the Metropolitan Tract properties. OFFICE PROPERTIES On July 18, 1953, the University leased a significant portion of the office, retail, and parking facilities to Unico Properties LLC (formerly known as Unico Properties, Inc.) (\"Unico\"). In 2004, the Unico Lease was amended to exclude the Cobb Building, and a new lease for that building was signed with Unico. The Unico Lease expired on October 31, 2014, and ownership of all leasehold assets transferred to the University. The University and Unico entered into a Transition Agreement to address \"end of lease\" issues that were not contemplated in the original Unico Lease. In addition, the following events occurred simultaneously with the Unico Lease expiration: The University terminated the ground lease with Unico for the Cobb Building and paid a termination price of $33,400,000 Ownership of the Palomar Garage property transferred to the University as agreed to in the Unico Lease In accordance with the Predevelopment Agreement, the University entered into an Interim Agreement for the Rainier Square development site that provides Wright Runstad with significant control over the management and operation of the Rainier Square Building in exchange for a fixed rent schedule for up to seven years In connection with the Interim Agreement for the Rainer Square, the University entered into a property management agreement with Wright Runstad for the Rainier Tower Building The University hired Unico Properties LLC to oversee leasing for all of the office buildings and property management for all of the office buildings except the Rainer Tower On May 15, 2014, the University entered into an agreement with Wright Runstad to undertake activities relating to the redevelopment of the site currently occupied by the Rainier Square (\"Predevelopment Agreement\"). In connection with this agreement, which commenced on November 1, 2014 and expires upon the retention of certain development milestones, the University would enter into a property management agreement for the Rainier Tower and an Interim Agreement for operation of the Rainier Square. Upon satisfaction of conditions included in the Pre-Development Agreement, the University plans to ground lease the site to Wright Runstad for a term of 80 years. HOTEL On January 18, 1980, the Board of Regents entered into a lease (\"the Hotel Lease\") for the Olympic Hotel property, which expires in 2040. The hotel was operated as the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel until July 31, 2003. On August 1, 2003, the remaining lease term was assigned to LHCS Hotel Holding (2002), LLC. The hotel was renamed the Fairmont Olympic Hotel and managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, Inc. On September 18, 2007, Legacy REIT, a publicly traded Canadian real estate investment trust and parent company of LHCS Hotel Holding (2002), LLC, was purchased by Cadbridge Investors, LP, a limited partnership majority owned by Cadim (a division of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec). The tenant under the Hotel Lease remained the same, and the management of the hotel by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, Inc. did not change. On June 1, 2015, the University consented to the assignment of the Hotel Lease from LHCS Hotel Holding (2002) LLC to IC/RCDP Seattle Hotel, an entity owned by affiliates of Rockwood IX REIT, Inc. and an affiliate of DiNapoli Capital Partners, LLC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 26 NOTE 8: Capital Assets Capital asset activity for the period ended June 30, 2015 is summarized as follows: NOTE 9: Long-Term Liabilities UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON Long-term liability activity for the period ended June 30, 2015 is summarized as follows:(Dollars in thousands)Balance at June 30, 2014Additions/ Transfers RetirementsBalance at June 30, 2015 LAND $ 126,795 $ 1,953 $ - $ $ 31,128 $ 4,172,378 (Dollars in thousands)Balance at June 30, 2014Additions/ Transfers ReductionsBalance at June 30, 2015Current Portion 2015 BONDS PAYABLE:GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS PAYABLE (NOTE 11) $ 165,044 $ 260 $ 15,740 $ 149,564 $ 18,290 PAYABLE (NOTE 11) NOTES PAYABLE AND CAPITAL LEASES:NOTES PAYABLE & OTHER - CAPITAL ASSET RELATED (NOTE 11) 24,008 7,205 2,975 28,238 5,020 NOTES PAYABLE & OTHER - ASSET RELATED (NOTE 11) 1,822 - 65 1,757 1,546 CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS (NOTE 10) 20,457 - 4,641 15,816 3,479 TOTAL 5,614 - 42,298 - POLLUTION REMEDIATION LIABILITY (NOTE 1) 22,000 - - 22,000 4,000 DUE TO RELATED PARTY (NOTE 13) 16,366 11,760 5,500 22,626 8,500 111,545 OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES 230,515 415,991 $ 2,608,659 $ 124,137(CONTINUED)FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 27(Dollars in thousands)Balance at June 30, 2014Additions/ Transfers ReductionsBalance at June 30, 2015Current Portion 2015 VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER LIMITED TAX GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS $ 243,503 $ - $ 6,271 $ 237,232 $ 6,535 REVENUE BONDS 18,858 - 1,376 17,482 1,650 BUILD AMERICA BONDS 61,155 - - 61,155 - NOTES PAYABLE & OTHER 1,407 - 513 894 291 TOTAL LONG-TERM LIABILITIES $ 324,923 $ - $ 8,160 $ 316,763 $ 8,476 NORTHWEST HOSPITAL REVENUE BONDS $ 73,400 $ - $ 73,400 $ - $ - NOTES PAYABLE & CAPITAL LEASES 13,645 - 1,175 12,470 525 TOTAL LONG-TERM LIABILITIES $ 87,045 $ - $ 74,575 $ 12,470 $ 525 Year (Dollars in Thousands) 2016 $ 49,313 2017 45,886 TOTAL MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS $ 401,927OPERATING LEASES The University has certain lease agreements in effect that are considered operating leases, which are primarily for leased building space.

NOTE 13: Related Parties Harborview Medical Center (HMC), a hospital and Level I adult and pediatric trauma center located in Seattle, is a component unit of King County, Washington. It has been managed by the University under a management contract between King County and the University since 1967. The current management contract was set to expire on June 30, 2015, but to facilitate ongoing negotiations of a new agreement, the expiration date has been extended by the parties to the earlier of December 31, 2015 or the date that a new agreement is effective. Under the contract, the HMC Board of Trustees determines major institutional policies and retains control of programs and fiscal matters, while King County retains ultimate control over capital programs and capital budgets. The University is responsible for the operations of HMC, including the provision of medical, dental and management services. All of the individuals employed at HMC, including physicians, are employees of the University. HMC expenses, including payroll, are reimbursed to the University from HMC fund sources.HMC revenues and expenses are not recognized in the University's financial statements. The University's financial statements do, however, include accounts receivable from HMC of $25,923,000 as of June 30, 2015, as well as HMC investments of $3,467,000, current accrued liabilities of $19,363,000, and long-term liabilities of $22,626,000. Beginning in fiscal year 2014, UW Medicine information technology began operating as a self-sustaining activity of the University (ITS department). The ITS department began recording enterprise-wide information technology capital assets that are purchased for use by UW Medicine entities. The Due To Related Party reflected in long-term liabilities (Note 9) of $22,626,000 at June 30, 2015 represents HMC's funding of the enterprise-wide information technology which will be included in the recharge rates of the ITS department over the useful life of the asset.The University of Washington Foundation (UWF) is a nonprofit organization that performs fundraising activities on behalf of the University. The UWF is not included in the University's financial statements as a component unit because gifts and grants that are made to the UWF are immediately transferred to the University. In 2015, the UWF transferred $82,502,000, to the University in gifts and grants received on its behalf; these are included in the financial statements of the University. The remaining amounts retained by the UWF are not significant to the University's financial statements.(CONTINUED)FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 31NOTE 14: Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) Healthcare and life insurance programs for employees of the state of Washington are administered by the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA). The HCA calculates the premium amounts each year that are sufficient to fund the statewide health and life insurance programs on a pay-as-you-go basis. These costs are passed through to individual state agencies based upon active employee headcount; the agencies pay the premiums for active employees to the HCA. The agencies may also charge employees for certain higher cost options elected by the employee. State of Washington retirees may elect coverage through state health and life insurance plans, for which they pay less than the full cost of the benefits, based on their age and other demographic factors. The healthcare premiums for active employees, which are paid by the agency during employees' working careers, subsidize the \"underpayments\" of retirees. An additional factor in the OPEB obligation is a payment that is required by the state legislature to reduce the premiums for retirees covered by Medicare (an \"explicit\" subsidy). This amount was $150 dollars per retiree eligible for parts A and B of Medicare for calendar year 2015. This is also passed through to state agencies through active employee rates charged to the agency. There is no formal state or University plan that underlies the subsidy of retiree health and life insurance. ACTUARIAL STUDY Actuarial studies, performed every two years by the Washington Office of the State Actuary, calculated that the total OPEB obligation of the state of Washington at January 1, 2015 and 2013 was $5.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The annual required contribution was $498 million and $342 million for the state of Washington for 2015 and 2013, respectively. The actuary calculated the OPEB obligation based on individual state employee data, including age, retirement eligibility and length of service. The probability of an employee of a given age and length of service retiring and receiving OPEB benefits is based on statewide historical data. The actuary's allocation of the cumulative statewide liability related to the University and HMC (an unconsolidated related party), was estimated at approximately $997 million and $671 million for 2015 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are not included in the University's financial statements. The University paid $248 million for healthcare expenses in fiscal year 2015, which included its pay-as-you-go portion of the OPEB liability, calculated by the actuary at $7.9 million in fiscal year 2015. The State Actuary's report is available at: osa.leg.wa.gov/Actuarial_Services/OPEB/OPEB.htmThe University of Washington Alumni Association is a tax-exempt entity that was established to connect and celebrate alumni and to support the University's mission. The Alumni Association received $2,818,000 from the University in support of its operations in fiscal year 2015. The University expensed this amount in fiscal year 2015. During fiscal year 2015, UWMC provided $3,444,000 to NWH for strategic support of operations. These amounts are presented in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position for the University as Other Nonoperating Expense and for NWH as Other Nonoperating Revenue. During fiscal year 2015, NWH entered into a long-term financing agreement with the University to obtain funds for the defeasance and advance refunding of Series 2007 Revenue Bonds. Under the terms of this agreement, NWH is required to maintain annual debt service coverage equal to at least 1.25 and days cash on hand equal to at least 50 days. As of June 30, 2015, $71,306,000 is payable to the University as a result of this financing agreement. The portion which is due in fiscal year 2016 is reported by NWH as Other Current Liabilities, and by the University as Other Current Assets, on the Statements of Net Position as of June 30, 2015. The remaining long-term portion is reported on the Statements of Net Position by NWH as Due to Primary Government and by the University as Due from Discrete Component Units.In addition, as of June 30, 2015, NWH has a payable to the University of $29,402,000 for services purchased from the University during the current and prior fiscal years. Payments to the University will occur each fiscal year beginning in 2016, with the first payment of $5,000,000 made in August 2015. The portion of the payable paid subsequent to year end is reported by NWH as Other Current Liabilities, and by the University as Other Current Assets, on the Statements of Net Position as of June 30, 2015. The remaining long-term portion is reported on the Statements of Net Position by NWH as Due to Primary Government and by the University as Due from Discrete Component Units.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 32 NOTE 15: Pension Plans The University offers four contributory pension plans: the Washington State Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) plan, the Washington State Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) plan, and the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System (LEOFF) plan, cost sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plans administered by the State of Washington Department of Retirement Systems, and the University of Washington Retirement Plan (UWRP), a defined contribution plan. The University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan, a defined benefit pension plan which operates in tandem with the UWRP, is closed to new participants. PLAN DESCRIPTIONS Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) was established in 1947 and its retirement benefit provisions are contained in chapters 41.34 and 41.40 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW). PERS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer retirement system comprised of three separate pension plans for membership purposes. PERS Plan 1 and PERS Plan 2 are defined benefit plans, and PERS Plan 3 is a defined benefit plan with a defined contribution component. PERS members include higher education employees not participating in other higher education retirement programs. PERS is comprised of and reported as three separate plans for accounting purposes: Plan 1, Plan 2/3 and Plan 3. Plan 1 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 1 members. Plan 2/3 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 2 members and the defined benefit portion of benefits for Plan 3 members. Plan 3 accounts for the defined contribution portion of benefits for Plan 3 members. Although members can only be a member of either Plan 2 or Plan 3, the defined benefit portions of Plan 2 and Plan 3 are accounted for in the same pension trust fund. All assets of Plan 2/3 may legally be used to pay the defined benefits of any of the Plan 2 or Plan 3 members or beneficiaries, as defined by the terms of the plan. Therefore, Plan 2/3 is considered to be a single plan for accounting purposes. Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) was established in 1938 and its retirement benefit provisions are contained in chapters 41.32 and 41.34 of the RCW. TRS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer retirement system comprised of three separate plans for membership purposes: TRS Plan 1 and TRS Plan 2 are defined benefit plans, and TRS Plan 3 is a defined benefit plan with a defined contribution component. TRS eligibility for membership requires service as a certificated public school employee working in an instructional, administrative or supervisory capacity. TRS is comprised of and reported as three separate plans for accounting purposes: Plan 1, Plan 2/3 and Plan 3. Plan 1 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 1 members. Plan 2/3 accounts for the defined benefits of Plan 2 members and the defined benefit portion of benefits for Plan 3 members. Plan 3 accounts for the defined contribution portion of benefits for Plan 3 members. Although members can only be a member of either Plan 2 or Plan 3, the defined benefit portions of Plan 2 and Plan 3 are accounted for in the same pension trust fund. All assets of Plan 2/3 may legally be used to pay the defined benefits of any of the Plan 2 or Plan 3 members or beneficiaries, as defined by the terms of the plan. Therefore, Plan 2/3 is considered to be a single plan for accounting purposes. Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System (LEOFF) was established in 1970 and its retirement benefit provisions are contained in chapter 41.26 of the RCW. LEOFF is a cost-sharing multiple-employer retirement system comprised of two separate pension plans for both membership and accounting purposes. The University participates in LEOFF Plan 2, which is a defined benefit plan. LEOFF membership includes full-time, fully compensated, local law enforcement commissioned officers, firefighters, and as of July 24, 2005, emergency medical technicians. FIDUCIARY NET POSITIONS The pension plans' fiduciary net positions have been determined on the same basis used by the pension plans. Washington State Department of Retirement Systems (DRS) financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The retirement plans are accounted for in pension trust funds using the flow of economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member contributions are recognized as revenues in the period in which the contributions are earned. Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of each plan. The Washington State Investment Board (WSIB) has been authorized by statute (chapter 43.33A of the RCW) as having the investment management responsibility for the pension funds. Investments are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included as investment income in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position presented in the DRS Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. Purchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade-date basis. DRS publishes an annual report for retirement plans which is available at: http://www.drs.wa.gov/administration/ annual-report/ (CONTINUED)FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 33ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS The total pension liability for each plan was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2013, with the results rolled forward to June 30, 2014. The following actuarial assumptions have been applied to all prior periods included in the measurement: INFLATION 3.0% TOTAL ECONOMIC INFLATION, 3.75% SALARY INFLATION SALARY INCREASE EXPECTED TO GROW BY PROMOTIONS AND LONGEVITY IN ADDITION TO SALARY INFLATION ASSUMPTION INVESTMENT RATE OF RETURN 7.50% Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Table and Combined Disabled Table published by the Society of Actuaries. The Washington State Office of the State Actuary (OSA) applied offsets to the base table and recognized future improvements in mortality by projecting the mortality rates using 100% Scale BB. Mortality rates are applied on a generational basis, meaning members are assumed to receive additional mortality improvements in each future year, throughout their lifetime. The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2013 valuation were based on the results of OSA's 2007-2012 Experience Study. Additional assumptions for subsequent events and law changes are current as of the 2013 actuarial valuation report. DISCOUNT RATE The discount rate used to measure the total pension liabilities was 7.50% for all plans in which the University participates. To determine the discount rate, an asset sufficiency test was completed to test whether each pension plan's fiduciary net position was sufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Consistent with current law, the completed asset sufficiency tests for PERS and TRS included an assumed 7.70% long-term discount rate to determine funding liabilities for calculating future contribution rate requirements. LEOFF 2 included an assumed 7.50% long-term discount rate to determine the associated funding liabilities. Consistent with the long-term expected rate of return, a 7.50% future investment rate of return on invested assets was assumed for the test. Contributions from plan members and employers are assumed to continue to be made at contractually required rates (including the component of PERS 2/3 and TRS 2/3 employer rates pertaining to the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for PERS 1 and TRS 1, respectively, as provided for in chapter 41.45 of the RCW). Based on those assumptions, the fiduciary net position for each pension plan was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return of 7.50% on pension plan investments was applied to determine the total pension liability. SENSITIVITY OF THE NET PENSION LIABILITY (ASSET) TO CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE The following table presents the University's net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate. DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY - NET PENSION LIABILITY (ASSET) (Dollars in thousands) Plan 1% Decrease Current Discount Rate 1% TRS 2/3 $ ($1,189) LEOFF 2 $ 1,217 ($2,844) ($5,891) LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN The long-term expected rate of return of 7.50% on pension plan investments was determined by the WSIB. The rate approximately equals the median of the simulated investment returns over a fifty-year time horizon, increased slightly to remove WSIB's implicit, small, short-term downward adjustment due to assumed mean reversion. WSIB's implicit short-term adjustment, while small and appropriate over a 10- to 15-year period, becomes amplified over a 50-year measurement period.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 34 The long-term expected rate of return was determined by the WSIB using a building-block method in which a best- estimate of expected future rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense, but including inflation) are developed for each major asset class by the WSIB. Those expected returns make up one component of WSIB's Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs). The CMAs contain three pieces of information for each class of assets the WSIB currently invest in: Expected annual return Standard deviation of the annual return Correlations between the annual returns of each asset class with every other asset class WSIB uses the CMAs and their target asset allocation to simulate future investment returns over various time horizons.Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the target asset allocation for each pension plan, as of June 30, 2014, are summarized in the following table: Asset Class Target Allocation% Long-term Expected Real Rate of Return Arithmetic FIXED INCOME 20.00% 0.80% TANGIBLE ASSETS 37.00% 6.05% PRIVATE EQUITY 23.00% 9.05% The inflation component used to create the above table is 2.70%, and represents WSIB's most recent long-term estimate of broad economic inflation. EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES Employer contribution rates are developed in accordance with chapter 41.45 of the RCW by the OSA, and include an administrative expense component that is currently set at 0.18%. The statute provides authority to the Pension Funding Council to adopt changes to economic assumptions and contribution rates. UNIVERSITY PROPORTIONATE SHARE Collective pension amounts are determined as of a measurement date, which can be no earlier than an employer's prior fiscal year. The measurement date for the net pension liabilities recorded by the University as of June 30, 2015 was June 30, 2014. University contributions received and processed by DRS during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 have been used as the basis for determining the University's proportionate share of the collective pension amounts reported by DRS in their June 30, 2014 Schedules of Employer and Nonemployer Allocations for all plans in which the University participates.

Employees have at all times a 100% vested interest in their accumulations. Benefits from the plan are available upon separation or retirement at the member's option. RCW 28B.10.400 et. seq. assigns the authority to the University of Washington Board of Regents to establish and amend benefit provisions. The number of participants in the 403 (b) plan for the year ended June 30, 2015 was 15,415. 403(B) FUNDING POLICY Employee contribution rates, based on age, are 5%, 7.5% or 10% of salary. The University matches the contributions of employees. Within parameters established by the legislature, contribution requirements may be established or amended by the University of Washington Board of Regents. Employee and employer contributions for the year ended June 30, 2015 were $105,266,000. University Of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan (401(A)) The University of Washington Supplemental Retirement Plan (UWSRP), a 401(a) defined-benefit retirement plan, operates in tandem with the 403(b) plan to supplement the expected defined contribution retirement savings accumulated under the UWRP.

The University makes direct payments to qualifying retirees when the retirement benefits provided by the 403(b) plan do not meet the benefit goals.FINANCIAL REPORT 2015 / 41NOTE 16: Commitments and Contingencies Authorized expenditures for construction projects unexpended as of June 30, 2015 was $157,034,000. These expenditures will be funded from local funds, debt proceeds and state appropriations. The University receives and expends substantial amounts under federal and state grants, contracts and programs. This funding is used for research, student aid, Medical Center operations and other programs, and is subject to audit by governmental granting agencies. Certain grant and contract costs billed to the federal government are subject to audit under OMB Circular A-133, \"Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.\" The University is also involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. University management believes that any liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material effect on the University's financial statements. The University is exposed to risk of loss related to tort liability, injuries to employees and loss of property. The University purchases insurance protection for workers' compensation as well as marine, aviation and certain other risks. The University also purchases insurance protection for loss of property at self-sustaining units, bond-financed buildings and where otherwise required by contract; otherwise, the risk of property loss is retained, unfunded. For medical professional, general, employment practices and automobile liability, the University maintains a program of self-insurance reserves and excess insurance coverage. The self-insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims resulting from events that have occurred on or before the Statement of Net Position date. The reserve includes the undiscounted amounts that will be required for future payments of claims that have been reported, and claims related to events that have occurred but have not yet been reported. The self-insurance reserve is estimated through an actuarial calculation and included in Long-Term Liabilities. Changes in the self-insurance reserve for the year ended June 30, 2015 are noted below: (Dollars in thousands) 2015 RESERVE AT BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR $ 67,450 INCURRED CLAIMS AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES 29,495 CLAIM PAYMENTS (14,744) RESERVE AT END OF FISCAL YEAR $ 82,201401(A) PLAN FUNDING The University received an actuarial valuation of the UWSRP with a valuation date of July 1, 2015. The previous evaluations were performed in 2013 and 2011. The University has set aside $188,881,000 as of June 30, 2015, for this liability. These funds do not meet the GASB technical definition of \"Plan Assets\" since they have not been segregated and restricted in a trust or equivalent arrangement. The UAL shown in the table above, therefore, does not reflect a credit for these amounts.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON / 42 Condensed combining statements for the University and its blended component units are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Statements of Net Position -

Seattle, Washington Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Seattle, Washington Drexel Hamilton, LLC New York, New York Re: University of Washington, General Revenue and Refunding Bon ds, 2016A - $195,145,000 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have examined a certified transcript of all of the proceedi ngs taken in the matter of the issuance by the University of Washington (the \"U niversity\") of its General Reve nue and Refunding Bonds, 2016A, in the aggregate principal amount of $195,145,000 (the \"2016A Bonds\"). The 2016 A Bonds are issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Univ e r s i t y a d o p t e d o n J u l y 1 4 , 2 0 1 6 (the \"Resolution\"). Simultaneously with the issuance of the 2016A Bonds, the University is issuing its Gene ral Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2016B (Taxable). Capitalized terms used in this opinion which are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Resolution. The 2016A Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their sched uled maturities as set forth in the Official Statement dated October 18, 2016. The University has not desig nated the 2016A Bonds as \"qualified tax-exempt obligations\" within the meaning of Section 265(b)(3) of the Int ernal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Tax Code\"). Regarding questions of fact material to our opinion, we have r elied on representations of the University in the Resolution and in the certifi ed proceedings and on other ce rtifications of public officials and others furnished to us without undertaking to verify the same by independent invest igation. Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, under exis ting law: 1. The 2016A Bonds have been legally issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the University, except to the extent that the enforcement of the rights and remedies of the owners of the 2016A Bonds may be limited by laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization o r other similar laws of general application affecting the rights of creditors. 2. The 2016A Bonds are special fund obligations of the University. Both principal of and interest on the 2016A Bonds are payable solel y from General Revenues and th e money and investments deposited to a special f u n d o f t h e U n i v e r s i t y k n o w n a s t h e G e n e r a l R e v e n u e B o n d R e d e m p tion Fund, 2016 created pursuant to the Resolution (the \"Bond Fund\"). The University has obligated and bound itself to set aside and pay into the Bond Fund out of General Revenues amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the 2016A Bonds as the same become due. The 2016A Bonds are equally and ratably payab le, without preference, priority or distinction C-2 because of date of issue or otherwise from General Revenues. T he University has reserved the right to issue Additional Bonds payable from General Revenues and has previous ly issued General Revenue obligations. 3. Interest on the 2016A Bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal al ternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations; however, interest on the 2016A Bonds is taken int o account in determining adjusted current earnings for the purpose of computing the alternative minimum tax impose d on certain corporations. The opinion set forth in the preceding sentence is subject to the condition that the Uni versity comply with all requirements of the Tax Code, t h a t m u s t b e s a t i s f i e d s u b s e q u e n t t o t h e i s s u a n c e o f t h e 2 0 1 6 A Bonds in order that the interest thereon be, and continue to be, excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The University has covenanted to comply with all applicable requirements. Failure to comply wit h certain of such covenants m ay cause interest on the 2016A Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income t ax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance of the 2016A Bonds. Except as expressly stated above, we express no opinion regard ing any tax consequences related to the ownership, sale or disposition of the 2016A Bonds, or the amoun t, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2016A Bonds. Owners of the 2016A Bonds should consult their tax advi sors regarding the applicability of any collateral tax consequences of owning the 2016A Bonds. We have not been engaged nor have we undertaken to review the a ccuracy, completeness or sufficiency of the official statement or other offering material related to th e 2016A Bonds (except to the extent, if any, stated in the official statement), and we express no opinion relating thereto , or relating to the undertaking by the University to provide ongoing disclosure pursu ant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12. This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no o bligation to update, revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may her eafter come to our attention or any changes in law that may hereafter occur.

Very truly yours, P ACIFICA LAW GROUP LLP D-1 APPENDIX D BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM The following information has been provided by DTC. The University makes no representation regarding the accuracy or completeness thereof. Beneficial Owners should therefore confirm the following with DTC or the Direct Participants (as hereinafter defined). Language in [brackets] with strike-through has been deleted as permitted by DTC as it does not pertain to the Bonds. 1. The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (the \"Securities\"). The Securities will be issued as fully-regi stered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such other name as may be reques ted by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. [If, howe ver, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respe ct to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be iss ued with respect to any remai ning principal amount of such issue.] 2. DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited -purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"ban king organization\" within the m eaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \"clearing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing fo r over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC's participants (\"Direct Participants\") deposit with DTC. DT C also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' a ccounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and cer tain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Tru st & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clear ing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as bot h U.S. and non-U.S. securities b rokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodia l relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\"Indirect Particip ants\"). DTC has Standard & Poo r's rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with t he Securities and Exchange Commi ssion. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. 3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records . The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (\"Beneficial Owner\") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DT C of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing de tails of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, fr om the Direct or Indirect Parti cipant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Securi ties are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Par ticipants acting on behalf of B eneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Securiti es, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued. 4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities wit h DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in benef icial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records refle ct only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may n ot be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping accou nt of their holdings on be half of their customers. D-2 5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Dir ect Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Partic ipants, and by Direct Participan ts and Indirect Participants t o Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among th em, subject to any statutory o r regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. [Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Securities, s uch as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents. For example, Beneficial O wners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their na mes and addresses to the Registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.] [6. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all o f the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practi ce is to determine by lot the amount of t he interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.] 7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accorda nce with DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as pos sible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direc t Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date (id entified in a listing attached t o the Omnibus Proxy). 8. Redemption proceeds, distribu tions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authoriz ed representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' acco unts upon DTC's receipt of fund s and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in acc ordance with their respective h oldings shown on DTC's records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the acco unts of customers in bearer fo rm or registered in \"street name,\" and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, Agent, or Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be request ed by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payment s to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. [9. A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its S ecurities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect de livery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent. The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connecti on with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Dir ect Participants on DTC's records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered Securit ies to [Tender/Remarketi ng] Agent's DTC account.] 10. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository wi th respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under such circ umstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificat es are required to be printed and delivered. 11. Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book- entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository) . In that event, Security certi ficates will be printed and delivered to DTC. 12. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's bo ok-entry system has been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer ta kes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.
