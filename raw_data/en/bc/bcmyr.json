Servicing providers acting as a locum tenen s provider must enroll in South Dakota Medicaid and be listed on the claim form. Please refer to the provider enrol lment chart for additional details on enrollment eligibility and supporting documentation requirement. South Dakota Medicaid has a streamlined enrollment process for eligible ordering, referring, and attending provider s that may require no action on the part of the provider as submission of claims constitutes agreement to the South Dakota Medicaid Provider Agreement . The following providers may bill for physician administered drugs and vaccines/immunizations (hereafter referred to as \"vaccines\") as permitted by their licensure : Clinical nurse specialists Health department clinics Indian Hea lth Service (IHS ) Nurse midwives Nurse practitioners Outpatient and inpatient hospital departments Pharmacies Physician assistants Physicians Tribal 638 providers South Dakota Medicaid does not enroll individual pharmacists. ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS Providers are responsible for checking a recipient's Medicaid ID card and verifying eligibility before providing services. Eligibility can be verified using South Dakota Medicaid's online portal . The following recipients are eligible for medically necessary services covered in accordance with the limitation described in this chapter: Coverage Type Coverage Limitations Medicaid/CHIP Full Coverage Medically necessary services covered in accordance with the limitations described in this chapter. SOUTH DAKOTA MEDICAID BILLING AND POLICY MANUAL Physician Administered Drugs, Vaccines, and Immunizations UPDATED August 23 PAGE | 2 Qualified Medicare Beneficiary - Coverage Limited (73) Coverage restricted to co-payments and deductibles on Medicare A and B covered services. Unborn Children Prena tal Care Program (79) Coverage restricted to pregnancy related services only including medical issues that can harm the life of the mother or baby. Refer to the Recipient Eligibility manual for additional information regarding eligibility including information regarding limited coverage aid categories . COVERED SERVICES AND LIMITS General Coverage Principles Providers should refer to the General Coverage Principles manual for basic coverage requirements all service s must meet. These coverage requirements include: The provider must be properly enrolled; Services must be medically necessary; The recipient must be eligible; and If applicable, the service must be prior authorized. The manual also includes non -discrimination requirements providers must abide by. Physician Administered Drugs South Dakota Medicaid covers most drugs and biologics administered in a physician or other licensed practitioner's office that cannot be self -administered. Physician and other licensed practitioners are responsible for ensuring that the treatment is appropriate based on FDA -approved indications, peer - review journals, and standards of practice. To be covered drugs and biologicals must represent an expense to the physician , other licensed practitioner, or legal entity billing Medicaid . Injections by a physician or other licensed practitioner of medications that can be self -administered are not covered unless justified by the recipient's condition. Administration For physician administered drugs, in addition to the HCPCS drug code, providers may separately bill the applicable administration procedure CPT code 96372 or 96373. The code may be billed once for each injection administered on a date of serv ice Units Providers must ensure that the units of drugs or biologicals administered to patients are accurately reported in terms of the dosage/units specified in the complete HCPCS code descriptor. Prior to submitting claims providers should review the HCP CS code long descriptor. Provider should not bill units based on the way the drug is package, priced, stored or stocked. The following are examples of how to bill units: HCPCS drug descriptor is 10 mg. 700mgs of the drug is administered to the recipient. T he units billed is 70. SOUTH DAKOTA MEDICAID BILLING AND POLICY MANUAL Physician Administered Drugs, Vaccines, and Immunizations UPDATED August 23 PAGE | 3 HCPCS drug descriptor is 5 mcg. 5 mgs of drug is administered to the recipient. The units billed is 1. HCPCS drug descriptor is 25 mg. 250 mgs of the drug is administered to the recipient. The units billed is 10. Pharmacy Acquired Dr ugs Drugs that are administered to a patient as part of a clinic or other outpatient visit are not covered under the pharmacy benefit. Do not bill drugs administered during an outpatient visit through the pharmacy POS system. South Dakota Medicaid does not allow \"brown -bagging\" or \"white -bagging\" of prescription drugs administered in an office setting. Pharmacies should not dispense drugs directly to a patient if the drugs are intended for use during a clinic or other outpatient visit. Discarded Portion of Administered Drugs When a provider must discard the remainder of a single use vial or other single use package after administering a dose or quantity of the drug or biological, provider must bill the amount of the unused and discarded drug on a separate claim line using the JW modifier. Providers are expected to use the package size that minimizes the amount of waste billed to South Dakota Medicaid . For example, if a patient needs 50 mg of drug and the product comes in 50 mg and 100 mg vials, providers s hould use the 50 mg vial. The line with the JW modifier pays at zero. The recipient may not be billed for discarded drugs . Donated Drugs South Dakota Medicaid does not reimburse providers for drugs donated to a recipient. The administration of the drugs b y a provider is covered. Do not include the code for the drug on the claim for administration. 340B Drugs South Dakota Medicaid does not cover drugs acquired through the 340B program. Providers must \"carve out\" and not bill South Dakota Medicaid for any dr ugs acquired through this program. For more information refer to the 340B Drugs manual. National Drug Code (NDC) Physician administered drugs must be billed with both a HCPCS code and an 11 -character NDC with no hyphens or spaces. The Federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) requires Medicaid state agencies to collect rebates from participating drug manufacturers for physician -administered or dispensed drugs. An NDC is required as it allows the state to identify which manufacture should be billed for rebates. The NDC is found on the drug container such as a vial, bottle, or tube. The NDC submitted on the claim must be the actual NDC number on the package or container from which the medication was administered. Refer to the CMS 1500 Claim Instructions for informatio n regarding reporting the NDC on a claim. Please refer to the Prior Authorization website for prior authorization forms.
