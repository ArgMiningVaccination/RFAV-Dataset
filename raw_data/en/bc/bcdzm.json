The County of San Diego is currently vaccinating individuals 6 months and older. You do not need to contact your doctor before your \u2014 or your child's \u2014 appointment unless you have a specific medical question. Which COVID-19 vaccines is Sharp offering? Sharp is providing Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Available type depends on supply, and we ask that you take the vaccine offered at your appointment. Both vaccines have shown to be highly effective against death and hospitalization due to COVID-19. How much will the vaccine cost? The federal government has paid for the cost of the vaccine doses. While your insurance may be billed for certain costs to give the shot to you, you will not have out-of-pocket costs associated with getting the vaccine, regardless of your insurance or medical group affiliation. Can I get my vaccine booster? Anyone 5 and older is eligible for the Pfizer or Moderna booster, 2 months after completing the initial series with any of the COVID-19 vaccines. Children 6 months to 4 years and older are eligible for the Moderna booster, 2 months after completing the Moderna primary series. Children 6 months to 4 years who received their first two doses of the Pfizer primary series can receive a third dose to complete the series. If you are 65 and older, you may receive a second Pfizer or Moderna booster, 4 months after your last booster. If you are 65 and older with a compromised immune system, you may receive a second Pfizer or Moderna booster, 2 months after your last booster. Please refer to your COVID-19 vaccination card to confirm the date of your last dose and to determine when you can receive a booster. If you cannot find your card, look up your information at [myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/). If you qualify for a booster, schedule an appointment on [MyTurn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) by selecting \"Booster dose.\" You do not need to return to your original vaccination site to receive a booster. Choose the location that is most convenient for you. How do I cancel or change my booster shot appointment? You can manage your appointments through [MyTurn](https://myturn.ca.gov/manage). You will need either the mobile number or email used for scheduling your appointment and the appointment confirmation number you should have received via text or email. Who can get the Novovax vaccine? Novavax is only for individuals 12 years and older who have not yet completed an initial COVID-19 vaccine series. Novavax can be given to individuals that have a contraindication to receive the second dose of Pfizer or Moderna and the doses are given at least 28 days apart. Novavax does not have a booster dose, however those that complete the 2 dose Novavax series are eligible for a booster with Pfizer (12 years and older) or Moderna (18 years and older) 2 months after completing the initial series. The vaccine is available at retail pharmacies, community clinics, San Diego County public health centers and community vaccination events. Appointments can be made through [MyTurn](https://myturn.ca.gov/). Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines, including the flu vaccine? It is safe to receive the COVID-19 vaccines with other regularly scheduled vaccinations, including the flu vaccine. If you receive multiple vaccines at the same time, they will be given in different arms. What is the difference between an additional dose and a booster shot? To provide the best possible protection for immunocompromised patients, the CDC recommends an additional (third) dose for those who received either Pfizer or Moderna for their initial series. This third dose is not considered a booster shot. If you are immunocompromised, you are eligible for an additional dose 28 days after the second dose of your Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Research shows that the immune system of many immunocompromised patients does not produce the same response that a two-shot course produces in healthy people. The CDC and FDA approved booster shots for healthy individuals because research has shown that the vaccine effectiveness begins to wane after 6 months. Is Sharp offering COVID-19 vaccine additional doses? We are offering additional doses to people with moderately to severely compromised immune systems only. The CDC and California Department of Health advise patients who received either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and have moderately to severely compromised immune systems to receive an additional vaccine dose. If you are immunocompromised and want to receive an additional dose, make an appointment on [MyTurn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) by selecting \"Additional dose (immunocompromised only)\" and then select a Sharp vaccination center. Additional doses for immunocompromised people are also available throughout San Diego at local pharmacies. You do not need to return to your original vaccination site to receive an additional dose. Choose the location that is most convenient for you. I am immunocompromised. When can I have an additional dose? The CDC now recommends that immunocompromised individuals receive a three-dose primary series (Pfizer or Moderna) of the COVID-19 vaccine, and a booster at least 2 months after the third dose. You are eligible for a booster 2 months after your last dose. [Read more from the CDC about COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised people.](javascript:HandleLink('cpe_165347_0','CPNEWWIN:_blank^@https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html');) How do I know if I am eligible for an additional dose? - If you are immunocompromised, you are eligible for an additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 28 days after receiving the second dose (Pfizer or Moderna), and eligible for a booster 2 months after the additional dose. - The CDC has identified the following patients as immunocompromised: - - Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Advanced or untreated HIV infection - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response Where can I get a vaccine for my child? The FDA and CDC have authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for children 6 months and older. The community clinics at Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center and Sharp Grossmont Hospital Care Clinic are vaccinating children 5 and older but not offering vaccines for children younger than 5. Appointments are required through [MyTurn](https://myturn.ca.gov/). Sharp Rees-Stealy patients: Parents and guardians of Sharp Rees-Stealy patients may book a COVID-19 vaccine appointment on [FollowMyHealth](https://www.sharp.com/patient/followmyhealth/). You do not need to contact your child's doctor for approval to receive the vaccine. Why should my child be vaccinated? While only a small percentage of children have become seriously ill or died due to COVID-19 complications, it is still among the top 10 leading causes of death in children. Children can also spread the virus to other vulnerable people so vaccinating a large percentage of children may help us get closer to reaching herd immunity and protect those at high risk of serious illness. Which vaccine will my child receive? Children ages 6 months and older may receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Can my child get their vaccine booster? Anyone 5 and older is eligible for the Pfizer or Moderna booster, 2 months after completing the initial series with any of the COVID-19 vaccines. Children 6 months to 4 years and older are eligible for the updated Moderna booster, 2 months after completing the Moderna primary series. Children 6 months to 4 years who received their first two doses of the Pfizer primary series can receive a third dose to complete the series. Does a parent or legal guardian need to be present with a minor? A parent or legal guardian is required to sign a waiver for anyone under 18 at the first appointment. If a parent or legal guardian is unable to accompany a minor, they can give verbal consent over the phone or complete an electronic consent form at the time of the appointment. Adult supervision is required for appointments. Is the vaccine safe for children? The vaccine is safe and effective. The FDA, CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics report that the vaccine is extremely safe for individuals ages 5 and above. Millions of people have already received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and serious side effects are extremely rare. Of the 2,260 adolescents who participated in the Pfizer trial, only mild side effects after vaccination were reported. The recently released data from the trials for those 6 months to 5 or 6 years also indicate that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are safe for this age group. Is the dose for kids the same dose given to adults? Dosage will depend on the age of the child. With the Pfizer vaccine, children ages 6 months to 4 years will receive a tenth of the dosage for people 12 years and older. Three shots are needed, the first given three weeks apart and the last at least two months later. Children 5 to 11 will receive a third of the dosage for people 12 years and older. Two shots are needed, given three weeks apart. With the Moderna vaccine, two shots are needed, given at least 4 weeks apart. Children 6 months to 5 years will receive a quarter of the dosage for people 18 and older. Can the vaccine affect fertility or my teens' menstrual cycles? There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has stated that unfounded claims linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility have been scientifically disproven and recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all eligible people who may consider future pregnancy. While some vaccinated adults have reported changes in their period after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, the information is only anecdotal, and the changes have not been directly linked to vaccination. Why should I get the vaccine? The COVID-19 vaccines prevent disease and death. The vaccines also prevent the lasting effects of the disease and work well against variants, especially those that are more contagious and severe than earlier versions of the virus. New research shows that antibodies from the vaccine offer better protection against variants than those acquired from an infection, so even people who have had COVID-19 should get vaccinated. Should I get the vaccine if I've had COVID-19? Yes. Since repeat infection is possible, people who have tested positive for COVID-19 should get vaccinated. Once you have recovered and are no longer contagious to others (which is a minimum of 10 days after infection), you can be vaccinated. People who recently recovered from COVID-19 may consider delaying any COVID-19 vaccination by 3 months from the symptom onset or positive test (if the infection was asymptomatic). Do I still need the vaccine if I had a positive antibody test? Yes. A positive antibody test indicates that you have already been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Since repeat infection is possible, people who have received a positive antibody test should get vaccinated. Can I get the shot if I'm sick? You should not get the shot if you are currently sick with COVID-19 or any other illness, or if you have had symptoms in the past 14 days. Wait until you are well. Should I get the vaccine if I am pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to have a baby? The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine both state that pregnant or breastfeeding people may be vaccinated, but please contact your provider if you have questions. There is currently no evidence that any COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems, including the development of the placenta. Additionally, researchers have confirmed that sperm count and quality are not affected by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. If you are trying to become pregnant now or want to have a baby in the future, you may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Can I get the vaccine if I am immunosuppressed? If you are immunosuppressed or currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, speak with your provider to determine whether you should receive the vaccine at this time. How do I replace my lost vaccination card? If you lost your COVID-19 vaccination card, you may request digital proof of vaccination through the [State of California Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record portal](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/). How do I correct my COVID-19 vaccination record?
