With so many brands making supplements to support your dog's skin and coat, choosing five to feature here took a little time. We started by making a master list of supplements from reputable companies. From there, we only included supplements that had a complete list of ingredients right on the packaging and came with dosing instructions. Finding products that were either formulated or approved by a vet was very important to us, so we ruled out any skin and coat supplement that wasn't. Reading reviews was a crucial part of the process, because we wanted to see what former customers thought of each supplement. We specifically looked for supplements that actually helped reduce shedding. However, we gave preference to the ones that also helped improve overall skin health. After reading reviews, we then did our own tests to see how our dogs \u2014 of all breeds and ages \u2014 responded to the various supplements. After a few weeks, it became clear which five supplements had the greatest impact on their shedding and coat quality. What Is Shedding? Shedding is the process by which dogs get rid of old or damaged hair. This process is natural \u2014 even healthy dogs shed. And some breeds do shed far more than others. For example, Afghan hounds, bichon frise, and Irish water spaniels barely shed at all. On the other end of the spectrum, you have high-shedding breeds like the akita, German shepherd, and chow chow. Different dog breeds also have different shedding patterns. Some shed seasonally, like in the fall before developing a winter coat, or in the spring when they're getting rid of it. Others shed year-round, and always seem to be leaving dog hair around. While it isn't always easy to control shedding (especially when it's a natural time of year for your dog to blow his coat \u2014 like many double-coated and long haired dog breeds do seasonally), reducing shedding with a few supplements can still work wonders. Why Do Dogs Shed So Much? Some shedding is normal. However, if your dog seems to be shedding excessively for his breed, this could be a sign of an underlying problem. The following are some of the more common causes of excessive shedding in dogs. Hypothyroidism Excessive shedding is sometimes caused [by hypothyroidism](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2001.tb01588.x), a condition in which the thyroid gland does not secrete enough hormones. Dogs with hypothyroidism may struggle with bald patches, flaky skin, recurrent skin infections, and lethargy. A vet can diagnose hypothyroidism with a simple blood test. If your dog is diagnosed, he can get medications to increase his hormone levels, which will ease his hair loss symptoms. Allergies [Allergies](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2022/12/21/best-dog-food-for-allergies-of-2023-top-5-options-for-pups-with-sensitive-stomachs/) can cause dogs to shed excessively \u2014 to the point that they may even develop bald spots. Your dog might be allergic to something in his food or may be allergic to fleas, pollen, or something else in his environment. Some dog owners use CBD supplements to manage the inflammation and hair loss that sometimes come with allergies. Dry Skin Dry skin can also contribute to hair loss. Sometimes, the dry skin is caused by hypothyroidism or allergies, as described above. Other times, it may be because your dog's diet doesn't have enough healthy fatty acids. In such cases, giving your dog a supplement rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like some fish oils, may help promote healthy skin and prevent hair loss. Dehydration If your pup is not getting enough water, his dehydration could also cause irritated skin and hair loss. You can encourage him to drink more water by refilling his bowl more often, placing it in his favorite hang-out spots, or adding a little chicken broth to the water. Some dogs also enjoy chewing on ice cubes. Well-hydrated skin is healthy skin, and healthy skin supports a full, glossy coat. Stress Sometimes shedding is brought on \u2014 or made worse \u2014 by stress. Did you recently move to a new home, make some changes in your daily routine, or bring a new pet home? All of these changes can be sources of stress for dogs and lead to bald spots, shedding, etc. If you take steps to manage your pup's stress and anxiety, you may notice his shedding decreases. Exercise, massages, music therapy, and calming shirts can all be helpful stress relievers. Poor Diet An overall poor diet or deficiency of certain nutrients can lead to a dry coat and excessive shedding in dogs. More specifically, dogs may lose hair if they do not get enough essential fatty acids or protein. Copper deficiency can also lead to patchy hair loss. To reduce the risk of nutrient deficiencies, experts recommend feeding dogs a high-quality diet that meet the nutritional guidelines set forth by the Association of American Feed Control Officials. What To Look for in Dog Shedding Supplements When selecting a shedding supplement, here are the key qualities to look for: Veterinarian-Approved or Formulated The best supplements for shedding are either formulated or approved by veterinarians. This should assure you that the formula is both safe and effective. You can always ask your own vet for their opinion on a supplement before purchasing it, too. Detailed Ingredients List Reputable dog supplements will have a complete ingredients list on the label. If you suspect allergies are behind the shedding loss, opt for a product that does not contain common allergens, like soy, eggs, wheat gluten, and chicken. Do a little research on any active ingredients to learn more about how they may help reduce shedding and result in glossier, thicker coats. Some common ingredients to look for in supplements for excess shedding include: - Fish Oil: High in omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil helps promote a healthy coat and skin. - CBD: Derived from hemp, CBD can help reduce inflammation and stress, which play a role in many cases of excessive shedding. - Olive Oil: Olive oil is a good source of fatty acids and [vitamin E](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700444/), which promote healthy skin and hair. - Zinc: A deficiency of zinc can contribute to hair loss, so some shedding supplements contain added zinc. Palatable Texture Most shedding supplements need to be given every day. So, you want to choose a supplement that your dog will eat willingly. Soft chews can be a good choice, but if your dog tends to be picky about treats, you might prefer a liquid supplement or powdered supplement you can stir into their food. Weight-Appropriate Dose Make sure the supplement you choose is suitable for your dog's weight. For instance, if you have a 10-pound dog, choose a supplement that has recommended dosages for dogs that size. Many supplements come with dosing instructions or dogs of various weights, but there are also supplements marketed specifically for very large dogs or very small dogs. If you have a very large dog, such as a 120-pound mastiff, it may be easier to give him one large chew than to give them six tiny ones. Similarly, it is often easier to give a toy dog one small soft chew than to have to break a big one into pieces. Using CBD to Prevent Dog Shedding CBD is unlikely to completely stop your dog from shedding because some shedding is normal and natural. But if your dog is shedding excessively, CBD does have some benefits that may help. Some cases are related to allergies, which cause inflammation of the skin. Luckily, CBD can help [reduce inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023045/). And sometimes shedding is caused or made worse by stress. CBD is also known to help ease anxiety and stress in dogs. If you plan on using CBD to help reduce your dog's shedding, make sure you buy a high-quality product that has been lab-tested. That way you'll know it's free of heavy metals, pesticides, and other contaminants. Can Supplements Help With Dog Shedding? Supplements aren't likely to stop normal, healthy shedding in dogs, but they may help control excess shedding. It all depends on the underlying cause. If a fatty acid deficiency is to blame, then supplementing with fish oil or other sources of omega-3s may work best. If stress is the culprit, then calming supplements like CBD may help reduce hair loss. You could also take your dog to the vet and ask for a blood test. If the blood test reveals any vitamin or mineral deficiencies, then supplementing with those specific vitamins or minerals may help reduce shedding. FAQs Are CBD supplements safe for dogs? [CBD supplements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120914/#:~:text=This%20plant%20contains%20many%20medicinal,2001) are generally considered to be safe for dogs as long as they are free from contaminants and don't contain too much THC. Dogs are very sensitive to even small amounts of THC, and it can cause seizures and vomiting. If you want to give your pup a CBD supplement, choose one that is lab-tested and formulated specifically for dogs. How do you know if your dog's shedding is due to hypothyroidism? In addition to hair loss, hypothyroidism can cause weight gain, lethargy, intolerance to cold, and increased skin pigmentation. If your dog has any of these other symptoms, take them to a vet. The vet can diagnose hypothyroidism with a simple blood test. This blood test measures the level of thyroxine, the main hormone produced by the thyroid gland. If thyroxine levels are low, then your dog may be diagnosed with hypothyroidism. What are some ways to manage shedding naturally? You can try managing shedding with bristle brushes, de shedding tools and regular grooming. Brushing not only removes dead hair, but can also stimulate blood flow to the skin, which can improve its health. Also make sure your dog has plenty of water to drink, as dehydration can contribute to hair loss. And, [bathing your dog](https://www.chicagomag.com/promotion/best-dog-shampoo-of-2023-top-5-vet-preferred-choices/) regularly will help remove dead hair before it falls out, reducing the furry mess in your home. Conclusion If your four legged friend is shedding excessively, then you may want to try dog shedding supplements. There are a lot of great products out there with active ingredients like olive oil, CBD, and fish oil. Look for a product made by an established, reputable company, and one that is recommended by veterinarians. And we found the five best dog supplements to help with shedding issues. With any luck, your dog's coat will improve, and you'll have a lot less dog hair around the home. That's what we call a win-win scenario for you and your pup.
