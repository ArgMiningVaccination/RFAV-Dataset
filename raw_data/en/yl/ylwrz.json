While these aspects of addiction must be addressed during the course of treatment, traditional detox programs don't address the damaging effects of addiction on the spiritual self. [Holistic drug detox programs](https://www.detox.com/drug/programs/holistic-drug-detox/) incorporate the spiritual self into the treatment process while taking a whole person approach in terms of treating the physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of the individual together rather than separately. For people looking for more than the straightforward, boilerplate detox experience, holistic drug detox offers many benefits that ultimately work to provide individualized treatment care based on a person's specific needs. The Holistic Rehab Treatment Approach [The holistic rehab treatment approach](https://www.detox.com/drug/drug-addiction/about-holistic-treatment/) views internal imbalance as the source of addiction. This imbalance tends to develop out of underlying issues that cause discord within a person's sense of well-being. Over time, a person's inability to cope with daily life pressures leaves him or her stuck, emotionally and unable to make sense out of his or her thoughts and feelings. These conditions inevitably give way to destructive behavior patterns, namely drug abuse. According to the [University of California-San Francisco](http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/insite?page=pb-daily-altmed), the overall goal of this treatment approach works to restore a state of natural balance by reconnecting the mind and the body. In the case of holistic drug detox, helping a person identify areas of emotional and spiritual imbalance becomes just as important as helping him or her overcome physical withdrawal effects. During the course of the treatment process, holistic drug detox equips recovering addicts with the tools needed to take responsibility for the way they think, feel and behave.

In addition, prolonged drug abuse has created a state of chemical imbalance in the brain making it all the more difficult to adjust. While relief from uncomfortable withdrawal effects becomes the overall goal, holistic drug detox programs treat the whole person rather than just the physical symptoms that result. According to [The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The world Bank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11796/), the holistic approach employs a range of alternative interventions in addition to the established treatment protocols commonly used in traditional drug detox programs.
