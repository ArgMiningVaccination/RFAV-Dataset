The American Health Association (AHA) has confirmed more than 20 publications of clinical research associated with meditation and all show consistent and positive results on the human mind and body. Further study in this field could yield fantastic results and will revolutionize how we treat medical problems. Then it just hit me: what if we mixed aromatherapy and mindfulness meditation? The result was splendid. In a way this is somewhat a new discovery for us too! Choose the Stress-Lessening Kind of Aromatherapy In order to facilitate a state of mind suited for transcendental meditation, you'll need to attempt to put your mind at ease as well as your [physical body too! Therefore the best type of aroma therapy in this case is the \"calming\" or \"soothing\" aromatherapy. The massage parlor knows what kind of essential oils to use for this massage so all you have to do is just ask them. However, if you need to do it at home, buy essential oils like chamomile, lavender, and geranium. Have someone in the family give you the aromatherapy massage or you can just hire a masseuse to do a home service. When you've finished you should be just about ripe to do your daily mindfulness meditations.](http://shambhalawellness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MP900321076.jpg) Daily Meditations with Weekly Peak Cycles of Aromatherapy Your daily [meditations](http://shambhalawellness.com/meditation/) should be between 20 - 40 minutes long although the latter is much preferable; however, make sure to cancel all your appointments when you go into this trance otherwise a distraction could backfire and only cause you to be more anxious. As you may already know a full body massage using aromatherapy is not recommended to be practiced daily, because it targets your circulatory system and any upset in that balance could prove harmful to your physical well-being. This is the same for Aromatherapy and essential oil meditations. So the best way to incorporate aromatherapy sessions is with your daily weekend meditations. 20 Facts about Transcendental Meditation Psychologists, behavioral scientists and other experts in the field of human psychology and behavior have published their research in various journals and publications.

A Liberating Experience I have actually tried doing [aromatherapy massage](http://shambhalawellness.com/massage/) and then did [Yoga meditation](http://shambhalawellness.com/beginners-hatha-yoga-by-norma/) afterwards and the inner calm I felt was like nothing that I've ever felt before. But you can ignore the sentiments and move on to the stuff that can be quantified. Well, how about being able to do 3-5 more things in 8 hours of work than when I was just on my regular days? Reading books, internalizing them and then apply them to my daily life was also among the things I noticed improved in my life. Having more confidence in facing any life obstacles day-in and day-out is what I gained from this experience, and I just say \"bring it on,\" to whatever may come my way. I can truly say that this is a liberating experience beyond anything I've ever known! I highly recommend Aromatherapy andor Massage to anyone who is just stressed out in their lives.
