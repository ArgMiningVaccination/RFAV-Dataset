Many vaccines must be mainta ined in the range 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C to retain product potenc y. As an extension to our study of household and pharmaceutical-grade refrigerator models used for thi s purpose [1,2], we h ave evaluated the p erformance of a small, unde r-the- counter pharmaceutical refrigerator model for vaccine storage use. The test unit [capaci ty = 0.138 m3 (4.9 c u ft)] proved fully adequate at maintaining vial temp eratures within t he desired 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C range, indepe ndent of how the refrigerator was loaded and unde r variable use and environme ntal c onditions. 1. EX PERIMENTAL M ETHOD In this study, we have evaluated the p erformance of a small, unde r-the-counter pha rmaceutical refrigerator for vaccine storage use. This study supplem ents our previous refrigerator studi and large pharmaceut ical grade refrigerator [1,2]. We have follow ed the same approa ch as in our precedi ng NIST-calibrated, Teflon-insul ated, Type T thermocoupl es in various locations inside the ref rigerator to determine the spati al temp erature d throug hout the unit's interior. As before, thermocoupl es were attached to refrigerator walls or storage trays, hung in the air, mount ed inside of glycol-filled bottles, and taped to actual vaccine vials. We also placed five digital data logging thermometers in various locations inside the r efrigerator. The t hermocouple and data logger installation pattern is shown in F ig. 1 be low.

A compl ete listing of the different trials and order in which they were performed is containe d in the measurement matrix (Table 2) below. In our previous studi es, we found changing the vaccine storage method (e.g. plastic trays vs. cardb oard boxes, or a mix of both) has minimal or indet ermin ate impact on a refrigerator's ability to mainta in vaccine storage temperatures. As a result, we have eliminated packing method va riation trials from this study. Table 2. M atrix of measurements p erformed f or the stu dy.

On average, we recorded 16 to 24 h of data for each trial, althoug h some trials were continued over the course of several days. The only exception to this was the door opening trials, which only lasted 4 to 5 h. The thermocouple measurement system records readings once every 10 s. The individual data loggers can be set to various reading rates. In general, the logge rs were set to record once every minute, except for logger F, which recorded at 30 s intervals. During the door opening trials, we increased the reading rate to once every 10 s to 42 s (de pending on the capa bilities of the l ogger). 2. INT ERPRETATION OF RESULTS 2.1 Ef fect of load ing density In trials performed using this refrigerator model, vaccine storage density did not appear to have a major impact on the refrigerator's ability to maintain the desired temperature range. The photog raphs be low ( Fig. 2) show the v arious le vels of p acking density tested. Fig. 2. Typical packing p atterns. Average thermom eter temperatures remain ed very stable throughout the study, showi ng minimal temp erature variability in response to different loading densities (see Fig. 3). With the exception of 2 thermocoupl es (TC3 - wall, TC17 - floor), average thermometer temperatures shifted by less than 1 \u00b0C for the duration of the study, despite being subj ected to low, medium, and high density packing loads. All of the thermometers maintain ed average temp eratures well within the prescribed 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C range across a ll trials. The two thermocoupl es that displa y slightly atypical behavior (3,17) were both installed in locations that we have consistent ly seen to be poor indic ators of properly stored vaccine temp eratures - that is, on the refrigerator wall (3), and placed in direct contact with the refrigerator floor (17 ). 5 Average temperature, \u00b0C 6 5.5 5 4.5 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 1 (wall mounted glycol) 2 (LH wall) 3 (RH wall) 4 (top back wall) 5 (air) 6 (vial - floor) 7 (air) 8 (air) 9 (air - top) 10 (vial in mfc packaging) 11 (vial in mfc packaging) 12 (vial - top) 13 (syringe in mfc packaging) 14 (inside tray) 15 (back of tray) 17 (glycol - floor) 18 (glycol - mid) 19 (glycol - top) 20 (vial - mid) LA (mid, shelf) LC (top, shelf) LD (glycol - top, tray) LE1 (glycol top, shelf) LE2 (glycol - mid, tray) LF (glycol - mid, tray) Figure 3. Average temp erature of pharmaceutical refrigerator for all sensors, as a function of loading pattern. Labels on the abscissa correspond to entries in the measur ement matrix of Table 1. Figure 3 shows the average reading for each thermometer across all of the closed-door pharmaceutical refrigerator trials, as well as the periodic door-opening trials. Other than the two aberrant thermocoupl es discuss ed previous ly (3,17), it is readily apparent that the main body of the refrigerator as well as the vaccine vials thems elves stayed within a tightly-controll ed temp erature range, regardless of packi ng density variations. The high-performance features and small size of this unit mi nimize the presence of spatial temp erature variations within the refrigerator's interior. Nearly all of the sensors recorded average temp erature s within a band of about 1 \u00b0C regardless of where they were located (e.g., top shelf, bottom shelf). For the duration of our testing (51 days), the vertical shift (e.g., drift) of this distribution was less than 0.5 \u00b0C. As such, it is clear that the small pharmaceutical refrigerator maintains stable set point control across the variable packing densities lik ely to occur in a v accine storage system, and is more than sufficient for normal, refrigerated v accine sto rage. One feature which is not visible in the average temp eratures summary graph (Fig. 3), is that while all of the mean thermocouple sensors remained within the specified 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C bounds, the steady state temp erature oscilla tions of several air and wall TCs consistently dip below 2 \u00b0C during no rmal refrigerator operation. These oscillations occur in respon se to the refrigerator compr essor timing and periodic circulation of cold air neede d to maintain a stable set point temp erature. Figures 4a and 4b below show the thermocouple response to steady state refrigerator temp erature oscilla tions. These graphs are representative of the stand ard temp erature response obs erved dur ing nor mal, closed -door operation throu ghout t he course of our stu dy. 6 Fig. 4a. (Left) One hour sample of n ormal, closed-door refrigerator operation with medium density load, a ll thermocouples shown. Fig. 4b. (Right) S ame one hour s ample of norm al, closed-door ref rigerator op eration with medium density load, but only thermocouples attached to vials or inside glycol-filled bottles are shown. The effect shown in figures 4a and 4b highlights the importance of choosing the right location and installation method for vaccine temperature moni tors. If we examine figure 4b, we can immedi ately see that all of thermocouples attache d to vaccine vials remain ed well within the correct storage temp erature range, as did the thermocoupl es kept inside glycol bottles, which give a good approx imation of liquid va ccine temperature response. However, in f igure 4a, we see that a number of thermocouples are registering minimum temp eratures close to 0 \u00b0C every few minutes. Figure 5 below shows the same sample of data, but only thermocouples hanging in air and the rmocoupl es in cl ose proximity or direct contact with refrigerator walls are shown. Fig. 5. One hour sample of data, thermocouples attached to/in close proximity to refrigerator walls or h anging in air are shown. Clearly, thermometers placed in these lo cations (air, walls) experience much greater temp erature fluctuations than the actual stored vaccine vials. This is consistent with the results we have seen 7 in our studi es of other r efrigerator types. While the small pharmaceut ical refrigerator exhibits extremely stable set point control and maintains stored items with minimal spati al temp erature variation, the air inside the unit and the interior walls are subject to much larger temp erature fluctuations. Relying on either of these locations as an indicator of stored vaccine temp erature is a mistake, and will surely result in \"false posi tive\" out-of-range temperature alarms. 2.2 Ef fect of door opening and closing\u2014normal use simulation The results of the periodic door-opening trials also support the efficacy of the small pharmaceutical refrigerator model. The refrigerator's ability to maintain temp eratures of stored vaccin es and correctly installe d thermometers was not impacted by our repeated, 15 s door opening pattern designed to simulate norm al refrigerator use. As we saw during o ur closed-door refrigerator tests, thermocouples hanging in air or close to the refrigerator walls recorded out-of- range temp eratures. Periodic door opening exacerbated this effect by causing large spikes in air temp erature (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. Door opening trial using a medium d ensity load, a ll the rmocoupl es shown. However, these spikes in air temp erature did not impact the refrigerator's ability to properly maintain stored vaccine temp erature. All of the remaining thermocouples (in trays, attached to vials, in glycol-filled bottles) and each of the electronic data loggers continued to record temp eratures within the specified 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C range throughout the door-opening trials. To isolate the effects of door opening on vaccine vials and thermocoupl es kept in glycol, the data from these selected th ermocoupl es onl y is shown in fi (LH wall) 3 (RH wall) 4 (top back wall) 5 (air) 6 (vial - floor) 7 (air) 8 (air) 9 (air - top) 10 (vial in mfc packaging) 11 (vial in mfc packaging) 12 (vial - mid) 13 (syringe in mfc packaging) 14 (inside tray) 15 (back of tray) 17 (glycol - floor) 18 (glycol - mid) 19 (glycol - top) 20 (vial - mid)8 Fig. 7a.

(Right) Temperature response of same selected thermocouples, recorded 17 h later and with r efrigerator door kept clos ed. Figure 7a shows the selected thermometer respon ses to repeated door opening. For comparison, figure 7b shows the closed-door, equilibrium temperature behavior of the same thermometers. While it is clear that the door opening does have some effect on stored vial temp erature, this effect is storage method and loc ation de pendent, and ul timately is not s ignificant enou gh to result in thermal excursions outside of 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. Only the rmocouple 12 (attached to a vial) show s marked temperature spi kes in response to door opening. However, this particula r vial had been removed from its original cardboard pack aging and was kept in an open tray. Removi ng vials from their packaging is not recommended by vaccine manufactures or in VFC guidelines, as the packa ging helps to preserve temperature stabilit y of the vial by adding a protective layer of thermal mass. Thermocouples 6 and 20 were also attached to similarly unpacka ged vials, and as a result, show much larger tem perature variations than the moni tored vials and syringes kept inside their o riginal boxes (TCs 10, 11, 13). Compa ring the doo r opening data to the closed-door data, we can see that the small pharmaceutical refrigerator's performance is such that the impact of door opening on vial temperature is minimal. Even in the case of improperly stor ed vials (e.g., removed f rom pack aging, placed on refrigerator floo r), the small pharmaceut ical refrigerator successful ly maintains proper vaccine storage temp eratures during normal door-opening use patterns. Table 2 below summarizes the results of trials in which the refrigerator door was left ajar for 1 h, showing t he amount of time elapsed once the door was opened until the moni tored vials exceede d the allowed maximum temp erature of 8 \u00b0C. These trials were conduc ted to maintain consistenc y with our previous refrigerator study methods. However, it should be noted that the specific small pharmaceutical refrigerator unit that we evaluated features a magnetic self-closing door. In reality, it would be qui te difficult or impossible to \"accident ally\" leave the door of this particula r unit ajar. For the purpose of these measurements, we intentionally propped the door open for 1 10 (vial in mfc packaging) 11 (vial in mfc packaging) 12 (vial - mid) 13 (syringe in mfc packaging) 17 (glycol - floor) 18 (glycol - mid) 19 (glycol - top) 20 (vial - mid) 22.533.544.555.566.57 8:00 8:15 8:30 8:45 9:00 9:15 9:30 9:45 10:00 Time, h:minTemperature, \u00b0C6 (vial - floor) 10 (vial in mfc packaging) 11 (vial in mfc packaging) 12 (vial - mid) 13 (syringe in mfc packaging) 17 (glycol - floor) 18 (glycol - mid) 19 (glycol - top) 20 (vial - mid)9 Table 2.

Drawing additional conclusions based on these results is difficult, especially given the fact that it is unlikely for this type of scenario (door \"accidentally\" propped open) to occur when using this small pharmaceut ical refrigerator unit. 2.3 Ef fect of Increasi ng Ro om Temperature To determine whether room temp erature fluctuations impact the pha rmaceut ical refrigerator's ability to maintain its set point temp erature, we performed three trials in which the room temp erature was varied between 20 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C. We can analyze the results by comparing the room temp erature probe readings from logger LD to the refrigerator probe readings from LD, LE1 and LE2. This a nalysis is s ummarized in t able 3 be low. Table 3. R efrigerator probe temp erature change relative to r oom t emperature change (\u00b0C) Logge r Name High Density Medium Density LD 0.03 0.03 LE1 0.02 0.03 LE2 0.02 0.02 Table 3 shows the temperature change recorded by each of the three refrigerator data logger probes scaled to the change in ambient temp erature recorded by the main unit sensor, which was kept outside the refrigerator. So, for example, during the High Density trial, logger LE1 recorded a temp erature increase of 0.02 \u00b0C for every one degree increase in room temp erature. All three data logger probes recorded a temp erature change of 0.03 \u00b0C or less per degree rise in room temp erature. This effect is so small that it could be a produc t of extraneous factors rather the changing room temp erature. If we assume these changes are in fact due to room temp erature variation and that the relationship is linear, we would need to vary environment al conditions by 33 \u00b0C just to see a one degree change in internal refrigerator temperature. The small pharmaceutical refrigerator's performance in these trials indicates that it should be able to withstand large ambient temp erature changes while maintaining proper vaccine storage conditions in its interior. However, it must be emphasi zed that because our study only mon itored the effects of a 5 \u00b0C room temp erature change, we may not have captured additional thermal 10 effects that could occur during much larger room temp erature changes. The use of a continuous temp erature moni toring system will allow workers to immedi ately 2.4 a Power Outage To observe what occu rs following a power outage, we performed two trials in which the closed refrigerator was unplugged and moni tored overnight. In both trials, all of the the rmometers recorded a fairly steep increase in temp erature that slow ed down slightly over time. All of the thermometers, includi ng those attached to vaccine vials, exceede d the allowed maximum temp erature within 1:16 h:min for the medium density trial, and within 2:25 h:min during the high density trial. To determine the required response time to preserve vaccine viability during a power outage situation, we examined the amount of time elapsed from the point that the refrigerator was unplugg ed until the thermometers attached to vials exceeded 8 \u00b0C. This information is reported in table 4 be low. Table 4. Time after power-off until vial temp erature exceeded 8 \u00b0C. Name and Location High Density Mixed Medium Density Mixed (mfc = manufacturer) (h:min) (h:min) vial 11 (inside mfc 0:33 vial 10 (inside mfc packaging) 0:53 0:48 vial 12 (in tray) 1:01 0:49 vial 6 (in tray) 2:09 1:00 vial 20 (in tray) 2:14 1:03 vial 13 (syringe in mfc packaging) 2:25 1:16 These results are similar to those obtaine d in power out age trials of the large pharmaceut ical refrigerator unit [2]. During a power out age event, both the small and large pharmaceutical grade refrigerators warmed up to temp eratures above 8 \u00b0C much more quickl y than the hous ehold grade uni ts that were tested. In the case of t he lar ge ph armaceut ical grade refrigerator, we attribut ed this effect to the unit's sliding glass door, which provides minimal thermal insul ation in compa rison to the stan dard opaque doo rs featured in hous ehold refrigerator models. However, the small pharmaceut ical refrigerator features an opaque door rather than the sliding glass type. It's possible that the unit's small size simply results in faster total equilibration time because there is a significantly less thermal mass to contend with in a 4.9 cu ft unit than in a 14 cu ft or 16 cu ft model. In this case, the reduced size mea ns that the small pharmaceutical unit warms up to ambient temp erature relative ly quickly duri ng a power outage event. To combat this potential weakne ss, users who opt to use this type of refrigerator model ideally should also select a robust continuous temp erature moni toring system with wireless alarm capabilities. In the case of a thermal excursion, staff memb ers receive electronic alarm notifications by email or phone . If a power outage occurs outside of norm al busine ss hours, workers receiving i mmedi ate alarm notifications may be able to implem ent a contingency plan in time to save the stored vaccines. 11 Ultimately, it's important for u sers to be aware that vaccines stored in a small pharmaceutical refrigerator may be more susceptible to damage from a power outage than if stored in some other, larger type of refrigerator. Other performance conside rations may still make the small pharmaceutical unit an attractive choice to certain types of use rs, so individual provider of fices should evaluate their needs to determine wh at sorts of risks are most critical to their situation. If the office featur es a robust, back -up generator system, then power-outage susceptibility may not be a s ignificant concern. In this case, the small size and excellent temp erature s et point control may outweigh the potential risk. By contrast, a different office with different circumstances may recognize that frequent power out ages in their area pose a significant risk to stored vaccines, and therefore would choose to use a unit that demons trates better insul ation and resistance to external heating. Recove ry from an outage in which the small pharmaceutical refrigerator is allowed to reach ambient temp erature requires ~ 3 h, regardless of refrigerator loadi ng density. The refrigerator's small si ze means tha t the unit rapidly cools down and equilibrates to its pr e-outage state. 2.5 D efrost C ycle in the Small Pharmaceutical Refrigerator According to the manu factur er, defrosting of this unit is primarily accomplished by circulating air during off-cycle periods, and unde r norm al conditions, the associ ated temperature increase is virtu ally unnot iceable. This is consistent with our finding s, as we did not observe any temp erature fluctuations occur ring in response to a defrost cycle. However, the manufacturer notes that an occasional warm-up of 2 \u00b0C is possible unde r very high loads, heav y use, and/or extreme a mbient condit ions. 2.6 General Stabil ity of Vial Temperature and Suitability of Small Pharmaceu tical Refrigerator Model for Maintenance of Vaccine Storage Con ditions Our r esults indicate that the small pharmaceut ical refrigerator model is suitable for v accine storage. Vaccine vial temp eratures remain ed within the specified 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C range throughout all of the packi ng variation trials, as well as during the 15 second door opening trials. Furthermore, average vial temp eratures varied by less than 0.5 \u00b0C throug hout this entire range of testin g. The small pharmaceut ical refrigerator exhibits excellent long- term temp erature stabilit y, even unde r varying conditions. The unit also displays superior spati al thermal unifor mity to that of hous ehold, consum er-grade refrigerators. With the exception of the interior w alls and floor, average temp eratures of stored vials and thermomet ers remain ed within a temp erature band of 1 \u00b0C, re gardless of exact location inside the unit. 2.7 P roper Locations for Vial S torage in the Small Pharmaceutical Refrigerator Throughout the course of the c losed-door ph armaceutical refrigerator trials, vaccine vials generally remained within the desired temp erature range regardless of their location in the refrigerator. Only one monitored vial (6) recorded small thermal excursions of less than half a degree below 2 \u00b0C on two occasions . However, this particula r vial was kept on the floor leve l of the unit. W hile the unit's user manu al does not spe cify whether storage on the f loor is a cceptab le, we have seen other manufacturers advise against this pract ice. In our previous studi es, we 12 observed that items stored in direct contact with the refrigerator floor frequently experienced aberrant temp erature conditions as compa red to items kept in the center of the unit. In addition, vial 6 was unpackaged from its original cardboard box, a practice that is discour aged in VFC guidelines and which we have obse rved to be problematic in previous refrigerator studi es. All other vials remain ed within the spe cified temp erature r ange and recorded zero excursions for the duration of testin g, regardless of loc ation or stor age method. This refrigerator model is purpose - built for vaccine storage. As a result, it features enhanced temp erature set point control and more a sophist icated v entilation s ystem th an is i ncluded in most hous ehold r efrigerator mode ls. Based on our studi es, vaccine storage anywhere inside the small pharmaceutical refrigerator unit will result in appropri ate storage temp eratures provided that several storage conditions are met. These conditions hold t rue for ANY refrigerator m odel or t ype: Store vaccines on s helves in c enter of the refrigerator Do not pla ce any vaccines in dir ect cont act wi th refrigerator walls Do not stor e vaccines on the floor leve l Keep vaccines in original cardboa rd packaging, as supplied by manufacturer. If plastic trays are used to cont ain and or ganize vaccines, place vaccine box es in t rays. Do not s tore individual vials in the t rays. 13 3.
