I should point out that my cholesterol has dropped 110 points since my last review, which I think has been 2 months. That's just amazing to me! If you're struggling to decide whether or not to see Dr. Beech please just go and see him. He and his wife are true healers and only want to help you feel your best. Ayurveda truly works! Original April 2023: I originally reached out to Dr Beech in hopes of obtaining a dosha assessment and pulse diagnosis, as it was required by my yoga training school. Fortunately, Dr. Beech quickly diagnosed several issues that I'm currently seeing other doctors & health practitioners for. His perspective made so much sense to me and his course of treatment sounded more logical to me than any others that have been proposed previously. I have decided to go along with his treatment plan, although it is quite different from my normal routine, in hopes that this will help me heal fully. I have put all of my other doctor's appointments on hold so that I can see to see how Dr. Beech's treatment goes. I am truly grateful for the wonderful and most needed services that Dr. Beech & his wife offer. I will be sure to update as I progress. Thank you Jennifer. I look forward to working with you on your journey to good health.

Dr. Beech J Michael Hemmer 2022-07-30 Like most Americans, I had never heard of Ayurveda, and I doubted whether ancient teachings about how to live and eat would have any effect. Under Dr. Beech's guidance (also Cary Twomey of Lincoln, NE), I became a reasonably committed Ayurvedic practitioner and am now, at 73, fundamentally healthier than when I was younger. Most importantly, and with no western interventions, my aggressive leukemia gradually subsided and is hard to detect in my blood. This rare and special Ayurvedic practice takes commitment, but especially it takes an expert teacher. Dr. Beech can teach you, if you want to learn and transform your life. Thank you, Doug. Thank you Michael. Your commitment to your health as been most inspiring. I'm so happy you are better. - Dr. Beech R Lacy 2022-04-25 I found Dr. Beech on the Cigna Providers website at Cigna.Com. I have been to a lot of Chiropractors before, but Dr. Beech is \"by FAR\" the Best ever!! As soon as I met him he was like a long lost friend!! He listened to my concerns, and addressed each and every one! He was never too busy to see me, and his chiropractic adjustments worked wonders for my Vertigo, and bad headaches. Not every Chiropractor is for everyone, but I am proud to say Dr. Beech is my Chiropractor !!! A+ SERVICE!! Great Doctor!! Highly recommend !! I think he is the Best in Frederick, Maryland!! Thank you Richard for that wonderful review. I'm so glad we were able to help you. - Dr Beech Sherie Koob 2021-02-24 I've been seeing Dr. Beech for a number of years and have always been blessed by his wisdom and knowledge of all things Ayurvedic. But, I just have to say WOW! when it comes to the Marma Treatments! I feel like I'm floating for hours afterward, have more clarity and feel ever so much better for days. They are very soothing and each one is different -- addressing the needs of my body at that specific time. I can't recommend them highly enough as they are off the charts! Thank you Sherie, I'm so happy the Marma treatments are helping! Mike Parlon 2020-11-11 Doc is low key and absolutely excellent and professional. Have a question he will do his best to answer it. Excellent Chiropractor. Glad I go here and takes insurance also Thank you Michael! Lo Legacy 2020-06-22 Had an amazing first visit!! I learned so much already =) feeling relief already! Thanks you! Meagen Wallace 2020-05-13 Positive Communication Professionalism Quality Dr. Beech is a sorcerer of the spine! I was admittedly skeptical at first, but the magic this man was able to do on my horribly wrenched back and ribs cast all doubt aside. He is kind and patient and very understanding- making sure to listen to your needs and explain everything so you understand his methods. This gentle soul not only helped my spinal problems, but helped me to understand how interconnect all parts of our health are. 10/10 recommended! Thank you for the wonderful review! I'm so happy when my patients feel better, I'm glad I was able to help you. Dr. Beech Betsy Woolfson 2020-02-19 I began using the salves that Dr Beech suggested. I was having excruciating pain in my left leg. After two weeks my pain is gone. Amazing Very good Betsy. I'm so happy you're feeling better. Dr Beech Karen Loosararian 2020-01-27 I went to Dr. Beech per recommendation of a friend who was successfully treated by him for severe Lyme disease. I had been diagnosed with SIBO. I had lost 15 lbs in 3 months and could not hold food , has very little energy, brain fog and unable to tolerate much food. . After the prescribed treatments by my gastroenterologist , I decided to try to ensure a complete recovery and prevent the common recurrence. Dr Beech has helped ensure that does not happen. I am now full of energy, clarity of thought and putting on some needed pounds. Thank you Dr.Beech! So good to know you are feeling better Karen. Thank you for the review. Sara 2020-01-14 Thank you Sara! Khara S-K 2019-10-24 For the first time in nearly two decades, I am experiencing real progress and improvements with the condition of my neck. I thought that neck pain would be something I would have to live with forevermore, but now--thanks to Dr. Beech--my neck feels better than ever. I am most grateful for his interest in addressing the root of my neck issues, which have been stemming from my feet (who would have known!). It has been a great blessing to work with him, and I would recommend his care to anyone with chronic neck or back pain, even if they have tried other chiropractors previously. Dr. Beech is WONDERFUL! Thank you Khara. It is great to hear you feel so much better! Kathryn Semuskie 2019-04-16 Thank you Kathryn! - Dr. Beech Bosco Marti 2019-03-28 The Ayurvedic cooking lesson was amazing! Prabha greeted us at her house sharing some stories of what her mother used to cook for her in India while we were savoring the best chai tea I've ever had. We learned a lot about the ingredients and the proper way to cook them to guarantee you get the best results. At the end of the class we were delighted by one of the best meals I've had in my life while at the same time feeling happy and with lots of energy. Bosco, it's wonderful to hear that everyone is enjoying the Ayurvedic cooking lessons! We're so glad the food and tea left an impression. We're looking forward to seeing what everyone cooks on their own. -Doug B., Owner Prem Jayati 2019-03-26 I had the most delightful time at Prahba's cooking class. I felt most welcome at Prahba and Dr. Beech's beautiful home, learned a tremendous amount about preparing Ayurvedic food, and had the opportunity to enjoy DELICIOUS food. I would highly recommend participating in this offering - it was a tremendous experience. Prem, the Ayurvedic cooking class is a unique experience, and it's wonderful that you enjoyed every minute of it! You're going to create many delicious meals, and we can't wait to see all that you'll accomplish. -Doug B., Owner D. Baranovskiy 2019-03-20 I've went here for their class on the Ayurveda cooking. Very informative, the food was great too :-) Highly recommended! There's always something new to learn, and we're so happy to hear that the Ayurvedic cooking classes are fulfilling that! We hope to see everyone back again soon. -Doug B., Owner Dante Settles 2019-03-20 The information shared was extremely valuable and the food was delicious afterwards It's wonderful to know that the classes are helpful! Kind words mean a lot to us, and we look forward to seeing everyone again soon. -Doug B., Owner robert smith 2019-03-18 Dr. Beech and his wife Prabha are serious about improving their patient's health and they approach it with a tremendous well-spring of knowledge and a relaxed, friendly spirit. They are very encouraging. My wife has been seeing Dr. Beech for about a year and her general health is dramatically better. We took Prabha's cooking class recently and it was enjoyable, informative, and delicious. I now understand some of the basic principles behind Aruvedic cooking and medicine and it makes so much sense it's a no-brainer. Making an appointment today for myself with Dr. Beech to continue the \"Aryuvedic\" journey and I'm very much looking forward to it. Beginning an Ayurvedic journey takes patience and determination, and we'll be here to guide our patients every step of the way. It's wonderful to know that the classes and personal appointments are helpful. We look forward to seeing everyone again soon! -Doug B., Owner Urszula Wojciechowska 2019-03-18 I very much enjoyed our Ayurveda cooking class. I was amazed how many recipes we were able to accomplish in 3-hour time. Everything was super delicious because it was cooked with love. Prabha was very passionate about teaching us step-by-step how to prepare Ayurvedic meals in efficient, yet fun way. At the end of the class, we were provided with cooking cards, so at home I immediately wanted to replicate the recipes. The instructions were easy to follow and yesterday my husband and I enjoyed our first Sunday Ayurvedic Lunch ...super yummy :) It's wonderful that the Ayurveda cooking class brought so much joy to a home! Making delicious, healthy meals are important to our overall well-being. We're so glad the class was a hit, and we hope to see everyone back again soon! -Doug B., Owner Annelise Brody 2019-01-17 I had been suffering from chronic muscle pain, I could not sleep well at night and it was affecting my life badly. I was very pleased with the treatment. After a few days I could finally sleep well again and getting better by the day! We're so glad we can help out those in need! It's a wonderful feeling to have relief from pain, and we'll be here if anyone needs anything else. -Doug B., Owner "}
