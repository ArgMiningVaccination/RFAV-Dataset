In a safe ceremony container enveloped in a scalar wave field modulated by healing Rife frequencies we combine movement, psychoactive breathwork, powerful sound healing tools (gongs, didgeridoo, flutes, bells and shamanic percussion), storytelling, affirmations, mantras and medicine songs to guide you through mildly altered states of consciousness deep into your core essence for rejuvenation and reunion with the Source. Breathwork is an integral part of yoga, qigong and other traditions. It is the most accessible natural way of inducing physiological and psychological changes. We use a technique known as alkaline breathing or holotropic breathing, which changes the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen in the blood and increases pH. This breathing pattern may cause the body to release DMT - a powerful psychoactive substance. Please do not overexert yourself, and promptly stop if you start to experience uncomfortable effects! Sound has been utilized in various cultures for thousands of years as a tool for healing. It helps to facilitate shifts in our brainwave state by using entrainment. Entrainment synchronizes our fluctuating brainwaves by providing a stable frequency which the brainwave can attune to. By using rhythm and frequency, we can entrain our brainwaves and down-shift our normal beta state (normal waking consciousness) to alpha (relaxed consciousness), reach theta (meditative state) and delta (sleep; where internal healing can occur). We use both traditional instruments (voice, gongs, didgeridoo, \"singing\" bowls, bells, drums, and whistles) and electronics to facilitate your journey. The Gateway also utilizes binaural beats - a technique used to induce the brain to register frequencies below the audible range (like the Schumann resonances produced by Earth's electromagnetic fields). Scalar Energy generators have been found to promote healing in the body by subtle energy frequencies. Scalar Energy is created naturally; however, it can also be artificially engineered. The energy form of scalar waves has the ability to carry information which is why it has had such a profound effect on the human body. Over the years, research has discovered the many potential healing properties of scalar energy, making way for \"energy medicine\". There are many purported benefits of scalar energy - Hydrogen bonds of DNA are strengthened by increasing the energy that holds them together which prevents damage - Immune system functioning can be improved - Radiating energy has a positive effect on the brain as the 2 halves become balanced. This improves mental focus and directly affects neurotransmitters, acting as a natural antidepressant for the brain. - Cell membranes vibrate an electrical charge that allows nutrients to move in and toxins and waste to move out at optimal levels of efficiency. - The body's cells are energized and overall, the body is encouraged to function at increasingly high levels. - Inflammation in the body is reduced. - The blood profile is rejuvenated and blood flow is promoted with increased oxygen being circulated. Blood pressure is also "}
