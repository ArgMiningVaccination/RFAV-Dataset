Sweeteners Standards The following sweeteners are artificial, do not occur in nature, and will not be allowed as ingredients in food/supplement products. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | Ace-K | | E950 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | Short for acesulfame potassium | | Acesulfame potassium | | E950 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | The potassium salt of a derivative of acetoacetic acid | | Aspartame | | E951 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | A dipeptide made by esterification of aspartic acid and phenylalanine | | Equal\u00ae | | E951 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | See aspartame | | High-fructose corn syrup | | - | | Sweetener | | - | | Neotame | | E951 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | Chemical derivative of the peptides, aspartic acid and phenylalanine | | Nutrasweet\u00ae | | E951 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | See aspartame | | Saccharin | | E954 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | Saccharin is produced from purified, manufactured methyl anthranilate | | Splenda\u00ae | | E955 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | See sucralose | | Sucralose | | E955 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | Made from sugar by the chemical addition of chlorine atoms | | Sunett\u00ae | | E950 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | See acesulfame potassium | | Sweet 'N Low\u00ae | | E954 | | High-intensity artificial sweetener | | See saccharin *E numbers are used in the European Union (EU) to designate additives that have been reviewed for safety and allowed in foods. They appear on the label of products sold in the EU. Guidelines Most polyol sweeteners (with the exception of erythritol) occur in nature, but in commercial practice they are obtained from hydrogenation of simple sugars to create the finished form. Therefore, these sweeteners, which are often used in low-carbohydrate, low-calorie or restricted-calorie products, should not be labeled as \"natural.\" There are few low-calorie, natural alternatives to these sweeteners. They may be described as chemically identical to the product that occurs in nature, but it is misleading to label them as \"natural,\" since hydrogenation is not a natural process. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | GMO Sugar | | - | | Sweetener | | Sugar made from genetically modified sugar beets | | Isomalt | | E954 | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation | | Hydrolyzed starch hydrolysates | | - | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation | | Lactitol | | E966 | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation | | Mannitol | | E421 | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation | | Maltitol | | E965 | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation | | Sorbitol | | E420 | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation | | Xylitol | | E967 | | Polyol sweetener | | Made from hydrogenation The following natural sweeteners are available and compatible with natural foods and the natural and organic retail channel. Acceptable natural sweeteners include: - Allulose - Barley malt syrup - Beet sugar - Cane sugar (vegetarians have concerns about sugar filtered through bone char) - Dextrose* - Erythritol (polyol sweetener made from fermentation; available as certified organic) - Evaporated cane juice - Fructose* - Fruit pastes (raisin, date) - Glucose* - Honey - Juice concentrates - Lactose - Maltodextrins* - Maltose - Maple syrup - Molasses - Monk Fruit (Luo Han Guo) - Rice syrup - Stevia and steviosides - Sucanat\u00ae - Thaumatin - Turbinado sugar - Xylitol - with documentation ingredient is naturally sourced *Corn-based sweeteners are usually derived from genetically modified corn seed. Manufacturers should use non-GMO sources for these sweeteners. 2. Colorings Standards Natural foods should not contain any artificial colors. The FDA regulates the use of Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) colors that are intensely colored compounds for use in foods. These are considered certifiable colors. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | FD&C Blue 1 | | E133 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment | | FD&C Blue 2 | | E132 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment | | FD&C Green 3 | | E143 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment | | FD&C Red 40 | | E129 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment | | FD&C Red 3 | | E127 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment | | FD&C Yellow 5 | | E102 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment | | FD&C Yellow 6 | | E110 | | Coloring | | Synthetic pigment Guidelines Some non-certifiable colors, even though derived from natural sources, such as caramels and synthetic beta-carotene, should not be used in foods labeled as \"all natural\". Some caramel colorings are processed with sulfite and/or ammonia and should not be used in foods labeled as \"all natural\". Oleoresins may use synthetic solvents for their production. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | Beta-apo-8'-carotenal | | E160e | | Coloring | | Synthetic | | Beta carotene\u2014natural identical | | E160a | | Coloring | | Synthetic\u2014food should not be labeled as \"all-natural\" | | Caramel coloring, Classes II, III and IV | | E150c,d | | Coloring | | Processed with ammonia and/or sulfites | | Cochineal/carmine | | E120 | | Coloring | | Derived from the bodies of insects\u2014should not be used in vegetarian products | | Paprika oleoresin | | - | | Coloring | | Synthetic solvents used in production | | Titanium Dioxide (EW24) | | E171 | | Coloring | | Acceptable natural colorings include: - Annatto extract - Aronia (chokeberry) juice - Beet juice - Beta-carotene from carrots - Black currant juice - Carrot juice, purple/black - Elderberry juice - Grape juice - Grape skin extract - Lycopene - Paprika - Purple potato juice - Red radish juice - Red cabbage juice - Riboflavin - Saffron - Turmeric Manufacturers should use non-GMO sources for these colorings. 3. Flavors and Flavor Enhancers Standards Natural foods should not contain any artificial flavorings. Any products labeled with artificial flavoring or natural and artificial flavoring are unacceptable. Many imported products may contain \"nature-identical\" flavorings, which are considered artificial in the United States. These are also not allowed. Allowed flavorings must be labeled as natural and must have certification from the flavor manufacturer that the flavoring is natural. It is recommended that the specification be reviewed and that all non-flavoring materials also should be natural as the FDA will certify flavorings as natural which contain synthetic non-flavoring ingredients. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | Natural & artificial flavorings | | - | | Flavoring | | Synthetic | | Vanillin | | - | | Flavoring | | Synthetic | | Glutamates, including monosodium glutamate (MSG) | | E620-E625 | | Flavor enhancer | | Synthetic, added rather than naturally occurring | | Natural Identical Flavoring | | - | | Flavoring | | Synthetic in the US | | Inosinates | | E630-E633 | | Flavor enhancer | | Synthetic | | Guanylates | | E626-E629 | | Flavor enhancer | | Synthetic Acceptable natural flavorings and flavor enhancers include: - Natural Flavors with no artificial non-flavoring ingredients - Yeast - Salt - Vanillin - with documentation ingredient is naturally sourced Manufacturers should use non-GMO sources for flavors and flavor enhancers. 4. Preservatives Standards The following ingredients are not allowed in foods or dietary supplements: Trans Fats - Primarily produced by hydrogenation which does not occur in nature Partially Hydrogenated Oils (PHOs) - FDA no longer considers these generally recognized as safe (GRAS) Guidelines Natural foods should not contain any artificial preservatives. Microbiological preservatives are used in foods for microbiological stability and for color and flavor stability, such as preventing rancidity. Stability may be achieved using a combination of heat, low pH, lower moisture (or water activity) or other means. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | Ascorbic acid | | E300-E302 | | Preservative | | Synthetic as available commercially; should not label products all-natural | | Benzoates | | E210-E213 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | BHA/BHT (Will prohibited after EW24) | | E320/E321 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | EDTA (Will prohibited after EW24) | | E385 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | Malic acid | | E296 | | Preservative | | Should use L-version made from fermentation | | Nitrates/nitrites | | E250, E251 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | Proprionates | | E280-E283 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | Propyl gallate | | E310 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | Sorbates | | E200-E203 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | Sulfites | | E220-E226 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | TBHQ (Will prohibited after EW24) | | E319 | | Preservative | | Synthetic | | Titanium Dioxide (EW24) | | E171 | | Preservative | | Acceptable natural preservatives include: - Acetates - Celery juice - Citrates - Citric acid - Mixed tocopherols - Natamycin - Nisin Manufacturers should use non-GMO sources for preservatives. 5. Gums, Thickeners and Emulsifiers Guidelines Natural foods should not contain any artificial gums, thickeners or emulsifiers. Gums and thickeners are used in foods to provide texture, increase viscosity and to help with dispersion and stability of ingredients within a food matrix. There are many chemically modified gums available that should not be used in natural foods. Emulsifiers are designed to help stability of oil/water matrices, such as in salad dressings. Many are derived from synthetic ingredients or sources. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | Modified celluloses\u2014ethyl, methyl, menthyl, hydroxypropyl, etc | | E461-E468 | | Thickener | | Synthetic | | Bleached lecithin | | E322 | | Emulsifier | | Synthetic | | Modified alginates\u2014propyl, methyl, etc | | E405 | | Thickener | | Synthetic | | Polysorbates (or sorbitan esters) | | E432-E436; E491-E495 | | Emulsifier | | Synthetic | | Mono- and di-glycerides and their esters, such as DATEM (Will prohibited after EW24) | | E471-E472f | | Emulsifier | | Synthetic, derived from hydrogenated oils and may contain artificial trans fats | | Esters of fatty acids (Will prohibited after EW24) | | E473-E479b | | Emulsifier | | Synthetic | | Modified starches\u2014corn, tapioca, etc. | | E1413-E1451 | | Thickener | | Synthetic | | Steroyl lacylates | | E481-E482 | | Emulsifier | | Synthetic | | Carrageenan (EW24) | | E407 | | Emulsifier | | natural gums and thickeners include: - - Arrowroot Cellulose (unmodified) - Gellan gum - Guar gum - Gum Arabic - Konjac flour - Kudzu - Pectin - Pectins - Lecithin (unbleached) - Locust bean gum - Native starches\u2014corn, tapioca, potato, wheat - Salts of alginic acid (sodium, potassium, calcium alginate) - Tragacanth - Xanthan gum Manufacturers should use Non-GMO sources for gums, thickeners, and emulsifiers. 6. Bread Ingredients and Dough Conditioners Guidelines Breads for the natural products industry should be made with unbleached flours and preferably with whole grain flours, wherever possible. In addition, there are many ingredients used in the baking industry that are synthetic and should not be used in natural products. |Ingredient||E Number*||Function||Why is it Artificial| | | Bleached flour | | - | | Ingredient | | Bleaching | | Potassium bromate (Will prohibited after EW24) | | - | | Dough conditioner | | Synthetic | | Potassium iodate | | - | | Dough conditioner | | Synthetic | | Azodicarbonamide (Will prohibited after EW24) | | E927b | | Dough conditioner | | Synthetic | | Ascorbic acid | | - | | Stabilizer | | Synthetic as available commercially; should not label products as all natural Acceptable natural bread ingredients include: - Enzymes - Unbleached flours Manufacturers should use Non-GMO sources for bread ingredients and dough conditioners. 7. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) Definition Products or substances/ingredients derived using the application of biotechnology* as defined in the New Hope lexicon. Pertains to plants, animals, fungi, microorganisms. Standards Foods containing ingredients made with or sourced from genetically modified organisms or bioengineered ingredients may be acceptable for exhibit and advertisements, HOWEVER, they may not be labeled or promoted as \"natural\" or \"all natural.\" Guidelines Products containing ingredients made with or sourced from genetically modified materials or bioengineered ingredients should include a statement of source for transparency. 8. THC Cannabinoids Standards Products may not contain more than 0.3% THC (delta-9). Products may not include THC isolate as an ingredient. Products may not be marketed for psychoactive effect. THC declarations intended to increase transparency or comply with state laws are permitted only on the information panel on the product packaging. 9. Plant-Based Definition Foods with ingredients derived mostly from plants, including vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and fruits, with no animal-derived ingredients. Standards Products containing animal-derived ingredients or nature-identical animal ingredients may not be labeled as \"Plant-Based\". However, specific ingredients may be identified on the packaging as plant-based, for instance, \"plant-based bacon\" or \"plant-based protein\", etc. Guidelines Products labeled as \"Plant-based\" may contain ingredients derived from non-plants sources such as fungi or algae. Fungi and algae, although not technically plants, may be considered ingredients of plant origin and may be counted as plant ingredients for purposes of these Standards*. Products labeled as \"Plant-Based\" should not contain synthetically derived ingredients. Products containing these types of ingredients should include a statement of source for transparency. 10. Processing Aids & Other Inputs not intended for the product (Will be implemented as of EW24) Definition Substances, ingredients or other elements used during the processing or manufacture of a finished product that are not intentionally added into a product and would otherwise not be required to be included within the ingredients list on the product packaging. 10.1 Veterinary medications Guidelines For products containing dairy ingredients, the source animals should not have been be treated with these medications. - "}
