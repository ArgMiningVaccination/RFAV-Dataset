BOYER-VINE DAVID A. CARRILLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER ED CHAU ANA CUBAS JANE MCALLISTER SENATOR RICHARD ROTH RICHARD RUBIN RICHARD SIMPSON November 21, 2019 To: The Honorable Gavin Newsom Governor of California, and The Legislature of California 1 The California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") was enacted in 2 1968 to promote public access to public records, while also 3 recognizing competing interests. In enacting the CPRA, the 4 Legislature, \"mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,\" found 5 and declared that \"access to information concerning the conduct of 6 the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every 7 person in this state.\" 8 Since its enactment, the CPRA has been revised over and over 9 again, in piecemeal fashion. This has resulted in a statute that is 10 poorly organized and cumbersome for members of the public to 11 use and understand, impeding fulfillment of the goals underlying 12 the CPRA. 13 To address that problem, the Legislature asked the Law Revision 14 Commission to study the CPRA on a priority basis and prepare a 15 report containing recommended legislation that would make the 16 CPRA more user-friendly, without changing its substance. More 17 specifically, the Legislature asked the Commission to develop 18 legislation that would: 19 (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. 20 (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. 21 210 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing 1 exemptions to the general rule that records are open to the public 2 pursuant to the current provisions of the CPRA. 3 (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with common 4 definitions. 5 (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that similar 6 provisions are located in close proximity to one another. 7 (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. 8 (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change in the 9 substantive provisions. 10 The Commission studied the CPRA as directed and this is the 11 requested report. In preparing it, the Commission took great care to 12 ensure that the proposed recodification of the CPRA would not 13 make any substantive change in the law. 14 This recommendation was prepared pursuant to Resolution 15 Chapter 158 of the Statutes of 2018. 16 Respectfully submitted, Victor King Chairperson 17 2019] 211 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP In 2016, the Legislature directed the Law Revision Commission 1 to conduct a strictly nonsubstantive clean-up of the California 2 Public Records Act (\"CPRA\")1 and related provisions. The 3 Legislature requested that the Commission complete this work \"as 4 soon as possible, considering the Commission's preexisting duties 5 and workload demands ....\"2 As requested, this recommendation 6 presents a proposed recodification of the CPRA to make it more 7 user-friendly, without changing its substance. 8 The history and purposes of the CPRA are discussed briefly 9 below, followed by a discussion of the history and purposes of this 10 study. The Commission then describes the general character and 11 noteworthy features of the proposed recodification, as well as the 12 methodology used in preparing it. 13 Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to 14 the Government Code. 15 History and Purposes of the CPRA 16 The CPRA was enacted in 1968 to promote public access to 17 public records, while also recognizing competing interests.3 In 18 enacting the CPRA, the Legislature, \"mindful of the right of 19 individuals to privacy,\" found and declared that \"access to 20 information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a 21 fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\"4 22 \"[P]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from 23 their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are 24 1.

In order 4 to verify accountability, individuals must have access to 5 government files. Such access permits checks against the 6 arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the 7 political process.7 8 Although public access to public records is of great importance, 9 it must sometimes yield to a competing interest.8 Thus, the CPRA 10 \"contains numerous exemptions to the requirement of public 11 disclosure, many of which are designed to protect individual 12 privacy.\"9 Under the CPRA, the public \"is entitled to inspect 13 public records unless one of the exemptions ... applies.\"10 14 The CPRA thus strikes \"a careful balance\" between the right of 15 public access and competing considerations.11 Since its enactment, 16 5.

Rptr. 3d 183 (2006) (Judicial decisions interpreting CPRA \"seek to balance the public right to access to information, the government's need, or lack of need, to preserve confidentiality, and the individual's right to privacy.\"). The statutory balancing of competing interests in the CPRA is similar to the interplay between two sometimes conflicting provisions of the California Constitution: the people's right of access to information concerning the conduct 2019] RECOMMENDATION 213 the Legislature has continually refined that balance, adjusting the 1 statutory scheme over and over again in an incremental manner as 2 new issues surfaced.12 3 Due to the piecemeal nature of these repeated reforms, the 4 CPRA has developed into a complicated tangle of statutory 5 provisions. In its present form, it is hard for users (especially non- 6 lawyers) to comprehend and follow, and hard for the Legislature to 7 place new material where it logically belongs. 8 Here are a few illustrations: 9 Instead of being grouped together, provisions with the 10 same subject matter are sometimes separated in ways 11 that can make key material hard to find. For example, 12 Section 6254(f) is a long and complicated exemption 13 pertaining to law enforcement records, with multiple 14 caveats, qualifications, exceptions, and exceptions to 15 the exceptions. Sections 6254.30 and 6262 clarify 16 aspects of Section 6254(f), but they are not referenced 17 in, or located in proximity to, Section 6254(f).13 18 Other CPRA provisions are buried amongst unrelated 19 material. Section 6254.7(c), governing records of a 20 housing or building violation, is a good example. It 21 of the people's business (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3) and the right of privacy (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1). See, e.g., City of San Jose, 2 Cal. 5th at 616 (\"Similarly, while the Constitution provides for public access, it does not supersede or modify existing privacy rights.\"); Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training, 42 Cal. 4th at 288 (comparing balancing in California Constitution with balancing in CPRA). 12. See, e.g., Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3 (\"Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has been amended multiple times to exempt certain records.\"); Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (June 14, 2016), p. 4 (referring to \"nearly 50 years of amendments to the CPRA\"). 13. Similarly, Section 6254(l) is a CPRA exemption for \"[c]orrespondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor's office or in the custody of or maintained by the Governor's Legal Affairs Secretary.\" Sections 6268 and 6268.5 also concern access to the Governor's records, but they are not referenced in, or located in proximity to, Section 6254(l). 214 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 could easily be overlooked, because it is located in 1 the middle of Section 6254.7, surrounded by 2 pollution-related material. 3 To place new material where it seemed to belong, the 4 Legislature has at times resorted to unsystematic 5 decimal numbering (e.g., Sections 6254.1, 6254.10, 6 6254.4.5). This is potentially confusing, because it is 7 difficult to determine the proper sequence of those 8 code sections and thus can be difficult to find them. 9 At other times, the Legislature has added new 10 material on a subject to an already overlong statute 11 that addresses the same subject and other topics. This 12 necessitates cumbersome labeling, such as Section 13 6254(f)(4)(B)(ii)(I). Such labeling makes it hard for 14 CPRA users to readily refer to the material in 15 question. 16 Problems like these impede fulfillment of the purposes underlying 17 the CPRA. 18 History and Purposes of the Commission's Study 19 In 2016, the Legislature recognized and decided to address the 20 problems described above. That year, Assembly Member Chau 21 authored the biennial legislative resolution regarding topics 22 assigned to the Commission for study. At the request of the 23 Assembly Committee on Judiciary, he included the following new 24 study in the resolution: 25 Resolved, That the Legislature authorizes and requests 26 that the California Law Revision Commission study, report 27 on, and prepare recommended legislation as soon as 28 possible, considering the commission's preexisting duties 29 and workload demands, concerning ... revision of the ... 30 California Public Records Act and related provisions, and 31 that this legislation shall accomplish all of the following 32 objectives: 33 (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. 34 (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. 35 2019] RECOMMENDATION 215 (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing 1 exemptions to the general rule that records are open to the 2 public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public 3 Records Act. 4 (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with 5 common definitions. 6 (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that 7 similar provisions are located in close proximity to one 8 another. 9 (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. 10 (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change 11 in the substantive provisions ....14 12 An analysis for the Assembly Committee on Judiciary explained 13 the need for such a study: 14 The CPRA, signed into law in 1968 as a general record 15 keeping law, allows the public to monitor government 16 activity. Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has been 17 amended multiple times to exempt certain records. ... Due 18 to the multiple changes to the statute, the CPRA has 19 become difficult for the public to understand.15 20 Similarly, an analysis for the Senate Committee on Judiciary 21 explained: 22 Because of nearly 50 years of amendments to the CPRA, 23 the CPRA has become more difficult to understand. Making 24 it easier for the public to understand their rights to access 25 government information will arguably lead to more access 26 to public records and more government accountability.16 27 14. 2016 Cal.

Soon afterwards, the 2 Commission began examining the CPRA as requested. 3 Scope of Study 4 As originally introduced, the legislative resolution instructed the 5 Commission to \"study, report on, and prepare recommended 6 legislation ... concerning the revision of the portions of the 7 Government Code relating to public records ....\"17 It was not clear 8 whether the study was to encompass all Government Code 9 provisions relating to public records, or only those relating to 10 inspection of public records. It was also uncertain at best whether 11 the Commission could examine any related provisions located 12 outside the Government Code, such as statutes that cross-refer to 13 the CPRA. 14 Later, however, the resolution was amended to instruct the 15 Commission to \"study, report on, and prepare recommended 16 legislation ... concerning the revision of ... the California Public 17 Records Act and related provisions ....\"18 Given this amendment, 18 the Commission's authority appears to be limited to public records 19 inspection law, not other aspects of public records law (e.g., laws 20 governing retention of public records19 or criminalizing conduct 21 relating to public records20). 22 Importantly, however, the Commission's authority does not 23 appear to be restricted to the Government Code. Rather, the 24 17. ACR 148 (Chau), as introduced on March 3, 2016 (emphasis added). 18. Due to what appears to have been an inadvertent error, the 2016 resolution referred to \"the portions of the California Public Records Act and related provisions ....\" See 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)). The italicized language was deleted when the Commission's authority to study the CPRA was reaffirmed in 2018. See 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)). 19. See, e.g., Sections 9080 (legislative records), 12220-12237 (State Archives), 14740-14746 (State Records Storage Act), 26201-26202.6 (county records), 34090-34090.8 (city records), 68150-68152 (trial court records). See also Sections 12270-12279 (State Records Management Act). 20. See, e.g., Sections 6200-6203.6. 2019] RECOMMENDATION 217 Commission may examine provisions located elsewhere, so long as 1 they relate to the CPRA. The Commission is thus authorized not 2 only to prepare a recodification of the CPRA, but also to 3 recommend conforming revisions of the many statutes throughout 4 the codes that cross-refer to the CPRA. 5 Whether the Commission is authorized to go beyond conforming 6 revisions and suggest additional clean-up of record inspection laws 7 other than the CPRA (e.g., the Richard McKee Transparency Act 8 of 201121) is not obvious from the language of the resolution 9 requesting this study. To move the study forward promptly, and 10 keep any resulting legislation manageable in size, the Commission 11 did not do so. 12 Nonsubstantive Reform 13 In directing the Commission to study the CPRA, the Legislature 14 said that the Commission's recommended legislation should 15 \"[c]learly express legislative intent without any change in the 16 substantive provisions\" and \"[n]either expand nor contract the 17 scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are 18 open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public 19 Records Act.\"22 The Legislature thus made clear that the 20 Commission's work was to be entirely nonsubstantive in nature. 21 The Commission took extreme care to abide by that limitation in 22 preparing this recommendation. The specific measures it took to 23 prevent any substantive change are described below. 24 Objective and Participatory Study Process 25 The Commission's study process is well-suited to the 26 development of a nonsubstantive reform of the CPRA, for the 27 following reasons: 28 21. Sections 92950-92961. 22. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (emphasis added). 218 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 The Commission is neutral and objective, with a long 1 history of nonpartisan statutory reforms.23 2 The Commission is experienced in drafting legislation 3 to recodify a complex body of law without 4 substantive change.24 5 The Commission actively solicits input from affected 6 individuals and interest groups. It carefully considers 7 each comment and often makes revisions in response 8 to concerns raised. 9 In proposing a statutory reform, the Commission 10 prepares a thorough report that explains the purpose 11 and effect of the reform. The report also includes a 12 complete draft of the proposed legislation and 13 accompanying commentary, a detailed table of 14 contents, and a table showing the disposition of every 15 affected section. This report facilitates public review 16 of the proposed reform. 17 The Commission's work is transparent. All materials 18 are publicly distributed. All deliberations are 19 conducted at open public meetings.25 20 23. For a listing of reforms that have been enacted on the Commission's recommendation, see the most recent version of its Annual Report (available at www.clrc.ca.gov). 24. See, e.g., Nonsubstantive Reorganization of Deadly Weapon Statutes, 38 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 217 (2009) (enacted as 2010 Cal. Stat. chs. 178 & 711, with support from both gun control and gun rights groups); Civil Discovery: Nonsubstantive Reform, 33 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 789 (2003) (enacted as 2004 Cal. Stat. ch. 182, without any \"no\" votes). 25. For a more thorough description of the Commission's study process, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2012-1; B. Gaal, Evidence Legislation in California, 36 Sw. U. L. Rev. 561 (2008); see also http://www.clrc.ca.gov/ Menu5_about/process.html. 2019] RECOMMENDATION 219 Commission Comments 1 In preparing a recommendation, the Commission drafts an 2 explanatory \"Comment\" for every section that is added, amended, 3 or repealed.26 A Comment indicates the derivation of the section 4 and often explains its relation to other law. 5 Virtually every Comment in this recommendation expressly 6 states that a proposed new code section continues an existing code 7 section \"without substantive change.\"27 That is important because 8 upon enactment of the Commission's recommendation, the 9 Comment will become a key aid in determining legislative intent. 10 On completion of its recommendation, the Commission will 11 present the full recommendation, including the Comments, to the 12 Legislature and the Governor. When a bill is introduced to 13 implement the recommendation, the Commission will provide the 14 full recommendation to each member of every policy committee 15 that reviews the bill. 16 Commission materials that have been placed before and 17 considered by the Legislature are considered evidence of 18 legislative intent,28 and are entitled to great weight in construing 19 26. In the proposed legislation presented in this recommendation, the Comment for each proposed code section appears immediately after the code section. 27. For example, the Comment to proposed Section 7921.705 states that it \"continues former Section 6264 without substantive change.\" The Comment refers to the existing provision as \"former Section 6264\" (rather than \"Section 6264\") because the Comment would be used after enactment of the proposed law and repeal of the existing version of the CPRA. 28.

Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 10 2020 is intended to substantively change the law relating to 11 inspection of public records. The act is intended to be 12 entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this 13 division and every other provision of this act, including, 14 without limitation, every cross-reference in every provision 15 of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 16 nonsubstantive intent of the act. 17 Proposed Section 7920.105 would make clear that a provision of 18 the proposed law is intended as a restatement and continuation of 19 the provision that it restates, rather than a new enactment, and that 20 any reference to a restated provision is deemed to include a 21 reference to the section that restates it (and vice versa): 22 7920.105. (a) A provision of this division, or any other 23 provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, insofar 24 as it is substantially the same as a previously existing 25 provision relating to the same subject matter, shall be 26 considered as a restatement and continuation thereof and 27 not as a new enactment. 28 (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing 29 provision that is restated and continued in this division, or 30 in any other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 31 Pac., Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 7 Cal. 3d 48, 61-63, 496 P.2d 1237, 101 Cal. Rptr. 869 (1972) (Comments evidence clear legislative intent of law). 35. See proposed Section 7920.005 infra. 222 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a 1 reference to the restatement and continuation. 2 (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this division, 3 or any other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 4 2020, which is substantially the same as a previously 5 existing provision, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, 6 be deemed to include a reference to the previously existing 7 provision. 8 Another provision (proposed Section 7920.110) would make 9 clear that restatement of an existing CPRA provision is not 10 intended to have any effect, positive or negative, on a judicial 11 interpretation of the restated provision: 12 7920.110. (a) A judicial decision interpreting a 13 previously existing provision is relevant in interpreting any 14 provision of this division, or any other provision of the 15 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and 16 continues that previously existing provision. 17 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act 18 of 2020, the Legislature has not evaluated the correctness 19 of any judicial decision interpreting a provision affected by 20 the act. 21 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended 22 to, and does not, reflect any assessment of any judicial 23 decision interpreting any provision affected by the act. 24 Proposed Section 7920.115 sets forth similar rules with respect to 25 an interpretation advanced in an Attorney General opinion, 26 because such opinions are particularly common and influential in 27 this area of the law. 28 Lastly, proposed Section 7920.120 would make clear that 29 restatement of a CPRA provision is not intended to have any 30 effect, positive or negative, on a judicial decision or Attorney 31 General opinion on the constitutionality of the restated provision: 32 7920.120. (a) A judicial decision or Attorney General 33 opinion on the constitutionality of a previously existing 34 provision is relevant in determining the constitutionality of 35 any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 36 2019] RECOMMENDATION 223 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and 1 continues that previously existing provision. 2 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act 3 of 2020, the Legislature has not evaluated the 4 constitutionality of any provision affected by the act, or the 5 correctness of any judicial decision or Attorney General 6 opinion on the constitutionality of any provision affected 7 by the act. 8 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended 9 to, and does not, reflect any determination of the 10 constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 11 The provisions discussed above would establish that enactment 12 of the proposed recodification should not be viewed as 13 acquiescence in any court case or Attorney General opinion 14 construing the CPRA, or as an indication that the Legislature 15 assessed the constitutionality of each recodified section in enacting 16 the recodification. The proposed law would take no stand and have 17 no effect on such matters. 18 In addition to these codified statements of legislative intent, the 19 proposed legislation includes an uncodified provision that sets 20 forth the following legislative findings: 21 This act would recodify the California Public Records 22 Act (Sections 6250 to 6276.48, inclusive, of the 23 Government Code) in a more user-friendly manner without 24 changing its substance, and make conforming revisions. 25 Consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of 26 the California Constitution, the Legislature finds and 27 declares: 28 (1) This act continues the existing substantive balance 29 between the public's right of access to information 30 concerning the conduct of public business and competing 31 interests. This act does not impose any new limitation on 32 the public's right of access, which would require findings 33 demonstrating the interest protected by the new limitation 34 and the need for protecting that interest. 35 224 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 (2) By making the California Public Records Act more 1 user-friendly, this act furthers the public's right of access to 2 information concerning the conduct of public business. 3 These legislative findings would further reinforce the 4 nonsubstantive nature of the reform. 5 Conservative Drafting 6 In preparing this recommendation, the Commission used a 7 conservative drafting approach. It stuck closely to the existing 8 statutory text, to further minimize the risk of a substantive change. 9 The Commission was especially cautious with Section 6254(f), 10 the exemption pertaining to law enforcement records. Although 11 that provision is particularly complex and difficult to understand, 12 the Commission refrained from attempting to rephrase it more 13 clearly.36 Instead, to avoid generating concerns about a substantive 14 change, the proposed legislation would relocate the substance of 15 Section 6254(f) in a new article almost verbatim.37 A provision at 16 the end of the article would expressly state that (1) before 17 recodification, the provisions in the article were located in a single 18 subdivision, and (2) dividing the substance of those provisions into 19 multiple code sections was not intended to affect their construction 20 or relation to each other.38 An adjacent article would contain the 21 substance of the related provisions previously mentioned (Sections 22 6254.30 and 6262).39 23 Legislative Process 24 After the Commission completes its study process and issues a 25 final recommendation, the proposed law would be scrutinized 26 carefully in the legislative process, just like any other bill. This 27 36. Similarly, the Commission refrained from addressing the apparently minor substantive issues that are listed at the end of its report in \"Appendix B. Minor Clean-Up Issues for Possible Future Legislative Attention.\" 37. See proposed Sections 7923.600-7923.625 infra. 38. See proposed Section 7923.630 infra. 39. See proposed Sections 7923.650-7923.655 infra. 2019] RECOMMENDATION 225 would serve as a final safeguard against any substantive change in 1 the law. 2 Drafting Approach 3 As discussed above, the Commission used a conservative 4 drafting approach in preparing this recommendation. Other 5 significant drafting techniques and decisions are described below. 6 Location of the Proposed Law 7 The CPRA is currently codified as \"Chapter 3.5. Inspection of 8 Public Records\" in \"Division 7. Miscellaneous\" in \"Title 1. 9 General\" in the Government Code. It is divided into two articles: 10 \"Article 1. General Provisions,\"40 which contains the 11 heart of the CPRA. 12 \"Article 2. Other Exemptions from Disclosure,\"41 13 which contains a list of CPRA exemptions (\"the 14 CPRA index\"), most of which are located outside the 15 CPRA. 16 To effectively reorganize the CPRA, it would be helpful to be 17 able to divide the material now in \"Article 1. General Provisions\" 18 into various subcategories, placing similar provisions together. 19 That would further the legislative objective to \"[o]rganize the 20 existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are 21 located in close proximity to one another.\"42 22 In the hierarchy of the Government Code, an article is the lowest 23 level heading used to organize code sections. Because an article 24 cannot be further subdivided, it would be difficult to effectively 25 reorganize the CPRA in its current code location. 26 40. Sections 6250-6270.7. 41. Sections 6275-6276.48. 42. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 226 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 Instead, the proposed law would repeal the existing CPRA and 1 recodify its substance in a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of 2 the Government Code. This would make it possible to divide that 3 material into parts,43 chapters, and articles \u2014 enough subcategories 4 to create a user-friendly organizational scheme.44 5 Structure of the Proposed Law 6 New Division 10 would be divided into six parts, as follows: 7 Part 1. General Provisions. 8 Part 2. Disclosure and Exemptions Generally. 9 Part 3. Procedures and Related Matters. 10 Part 4. Enforcement. 11 Part 5. Specific Types of Public Records. 12 Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure. 13 The content of each part is described briefly below. 14 Proposed \"Part 1. General Provisions\"45 consists of two 15 chapters. \"Chapter 1. Preliminary Provisions\" includes the short 16 title of the law,46 the statements of legislative intent described 17 above,47 and a few other preliminary provisions.48 \"Chapter 2. 18 Definitions\" consists of some definitions that apply to the entire 19 43. There is precedent for using \"part\" as a subheading within the Government Code. See \"Division 3.6. Claims and Actions Against Public Entities and Public Employees\" (Sections 810-998.3). 44. In deciding to relocate the CPRA, the Commission noted that the CPRA is currently located near several other chapters that pertain to public records (see Chapters 3, 3.01, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of Division 7 of Title 1). To alert CPRA users to that material, the Commission's Comment to the introductory provision in new Division 10 would refer each of those chapters. See proposed Section 7920.000 Comment infra. 45. Proposed Sections 7920.000-7920.545 infra. 46. Proposed Section 7920.000 infra. 47. Proposed 48. and 7920.200 infra. 2019] RECOMMENDATION 227 CPRA.49 That chapter also includes (1) the definition of \"elected or 1 appointed official,\" which is used in a CPRA-wide definition,50 2 and (2) a definition of \"former Section 6254 provisions,\" which 3 will provide a convenient means of collectively referring to the 4 material that is currently located in Section 6254 (an 5 unmanageably long section) but would be split up in the 6 recodification.51 The definitions in \"Chapter 2. Definitions\" would 7 be in alphabetical order. The other definitions used in the CPRA 8 have limited application and would remain in close proximity to 9 the substantive material to which they pertain.52 10 Proposed \"Part 2. Disclosure and Exemptions Generally\"53 11 consists of three chapters. \"Chapter 1. Right of Access to Public 12 Records\" contains the legislative findings and declarations for the 13 CPRA.54 The chapter also contains some restrictions on an 14 agency's ability to transfer a public record or otherwise relinquish 15 control over its disclosure.55 \"Chapter 2. General Rules Governing 16 Disclosure\"56 and \"Chapter 3. General Rules Governing 17 Exemptions from Disclosure\"57 contain material corresponding to 18 their respective titles. Among other things, the CPRA catch-all 19 exemption (existing Section 6255(a)) would be in \"Chapter 3. 20 General Rules Governing Exemptions from Disclosure.\"58 21 49. See proposed Sections 7920.510-7920.545 infra. 50. See proposed Section 7920.500 infra. 51. See proposed Section 7920.505 infra. 52. See, e.g., proposed Sections 7924.100 and 7924.105 infra. 53.

To help CPRA users locate the catch-all exemption, the Comments to many of the proposed new sections would refer to it. 228 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 Proposed \"Part 3. Procedures and Related Matters\"59 contains a 1 chapter on how to request a public record, which is divided into 2 several articles.60 Among other things, the chapter includes the 3 basic rule on inspection of a public record61 and the basic rule on 4 copying of a public record.62 Proposed \"Part 3. Procedures and 5 Related Matters\" also contains a second chapter, which consists of 6 the CPRA's procedural rules governing agency regulations, 7 guidelines, systems, and similar matters.63 8 Proposed \"Part 4. Enforcement\"64 contains provisions relating to 9 enforcement of a CPRA request. It is divided into two chapters: (1) 10 a chapter of general principles relating to enforcement65 and (2) a 11 chapter on the enforcement process, which is further subdivided 12 into an article on petitioning the superior court66 and an article on 13 writ review and contempt.67 14 Proposed \"Part 5. Specific Types of Public Records\"68 consists 15 of provisions (mostly exemptions) that relate to a specific type of 16 public record. It is divided into nineteen different chapters, each 17 addressing a particular subject matter, such as \"Crimes, Weapons, 18 and Law Enforcement\"69 or \"Health Care.\"70 The chapters are 19 arranged in alphabetical order. 20 59.

Other Exemptions From Disclosure\"71 1 contains the CPRA's alphabetical index of exemptions,72 which is 2 not substantive law but rather a tool designed by the Legislature to 3 assist CPRA users locate exemptions scattered throughout the 4 codes.73 Part 6 would continue that index in essentially its current, 5 alphabetical format.74 The Commission considered but rejected 6 other possibilities,75 such as reorganizing the index by subject 7 matter76 or relocating all of the exemptions into the CPRA (thus 8 separating them from other substantive provisions on the same 9 subject matter).77 10 Numbering System 11 Throughout the proposed legislation, the Commission used a 3- 12 digit decimal system for numbering code sections (e.g., Section 13 71. Proposed Sections 7930.000-7930.215 infra. 72. Sections 6275-6276.48. 73. See Sections 6275-6276. For further discussion of the CPRA index, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25. 74. The Commission checked each entry in the index and updated some problematic entries as noted in the Comments to proposed Sections 7930.105-7930.115, 7930.130-7930.135, 7930.145, and 7930.155-7930.205 infra and discussed in the accompanying Notes. The Commission also added an entry for California's constitutional right of privacy (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1), because it is so fundamental. See proposed Section 7930.100 infra. The Commission did not attempt to find other provisions that should be added to the CPRA index. Such research would be time-consuming and could have significantly delayed the progress of this study. It is not essential at this time, because the index is just a user guide (not substantive law) and does not purport to be exhaustive. See Sections 6275-6276 (proposed Sections 7930.000-7930.005 infra). 75. See CLRC Minutes (April 2019), p. 6. 76. See CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25, pp. 6-8 & attached \"Partial Draft of 'Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure' of Proposed New Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government Code.\" 77. See CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25, pp. 5-6. 230 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 7920.000). The Commission also left gaps in the numbering, to 1 allow ready insertion of new statutory material in an appropriate 2 location if needed in the future. 3 This numbering approach will prevent confusion regarding the 4 proper sequencing of code sections. It will also promote logical, 5 user-friendly organization as the CPRA continues to evolve. 6 Short, Simple Sections 7 The legislative resolution on this study instructs the Commission 8 to \"[r]educe the length and complexity of current sections.\"78 The 9 CPRA currently contains a number of long and complicated 10 sections, most notably Section 6254, which spans many single- 11 spaced pages if printed from the Legislative Counsel's website 12 (over 5,500 words), with subdivisions labeled from (a) to (z) 13 followed by (aa) to (ad), some of which are split into paragraphs, 14 subparagraphs, and even unnumbered provisions.79 15 Excessively long sections can obscure relevant details of law, 16 especially if a single section addresses several different subjects. A 17 better approach is to divide the law into a larger number of smaller 18 sections, with each section limited to a single subject. 19 Short sections have numerous advantages. They enhance 20 readability and understanding of the law, and make it easier to 21 locate and refer to pertinent material. In contrast to a long section, 22 a short section can be amended without undue technical 23 difficulties80 and new material can be inserted where logically 24 78. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 79. For the text of Section 6254, see Appendix C. Other, less egregious examples in the CPRA include Sections 6253, 6254.2, 6254.18, and 6254.21. 80. The full text of a section must be set forth in any bill amending the section. Joint Rule 10. A lengthy bill entails higher printing costs than a short one. It also takes longer to review. Much of the material may be unrelated to a proposed reform, wasting reviewers' time and potentially injecting additional issues into a simple proposal. 2019] RECOMMENDATION 231 appropriate, facilitating sound development of the law.81 The use 1 of short sections is the preferred drafting technique of the 2 California Code Commission,82 the Legislature,83 the Legislative 3 Counsel,84 and the Law Revision Commission.85 4 For all of the reasons discussed above, the proposed law would 5 divide lengthy sections into shorter and simpler provisions. The 6 number of sections would approximately double, but the word 7 count would not change that much. 8 Signposting in Comments 9 In the proposed legislation, the Comment accompanying each 10 code section would refer to other provisions (particularly within 11 the CPRA) that may be of interest to users.86 This would help 12 CPRA users locate material relevant to their situations. 13 Further, the likelihood that two bills will be introduced to amend the same section is greater if a section is long and covers multiple topics than if a section is short and limited to a single topic. If two bills affect the same section and both are enacted, the bill that is signed last generally prevails over the other bill, rendering it a nullity. Section 9605. This can be avoided by double-jointing the bills or including other language to address the conflict. Taking such steps entails expense and effort, however, and introduces new possibilities for error. 81. In amending a short section, the Legislature is unhampered by constraints such as overlong paragraphs and lack of available subparts. This promotes clear and straightforward drafting, as opposed to confusing and convoluted provisions. 82.

See, e.g., proposed Section 7920.000 Comment & proposed Section 7921.000 Comment infra. 232 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 Cross-References 1 The CPRA contains numerous internal cross-references. In the 2 proposed legislation, the Commission updated each such cross- 3 reference to reflect the new numbering scheme in the 4 recodification. 5 To facilitate review of the updated cross-references, this 6 recommendation includes two tables, located immediately after the 7 proposed legislation. One table shows the disposition of each 8 existing code section; the other table shows the derivation of each 9 proposed code section. 10 The CPRA also contains numerous cross-references to statutes 11 located outside the CPRA. The Commission checked each of those 12 cross-references, as well as each of the internal cross-references, in 13 preparing this recommendation. 14 A few of the cross-references in the current version of the CPRA 15 are plainly erroneous. Where the proper cross-reference is obvious, 16 the Commission corrected the cross-reference in the proposed 17 legislation, rather than perpetuating the error. The cross-reference 18 corrections are explained in the accompanying Comments; they are 19 also listed and explained in Appendix A. Where the proper cross- 20 reference is not altogether obvious, the Commission left the cross- 21 reference alone, so as not to create a risk of a substantive change. 22 There are also many code sections located outside the CPRA 23 that cross-refer to one or more provisions within the CPRA. Those 24 cross-references will also need to be conformed to the new 25 numbering scheme in the recodification. The Commission prepared 26 a separate recommendation with those conforming revisions.87 27 One issue relating to cross-references merits special mention. 28 Within the CPRA, some provisions cross-refer to Section 6254 in 29 its entirety;88 such cross-references also exist elsewhere in the 30 87. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up: Conforming Revisions, 46 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 563 (2019). 88. See Sections 6253.1(d)(2) (proposed Section 7922.605(a)), 6254.5 (proposed Section 7923.110(a)). 2019] RECOMMENDATION 233 codes.89 In at least some of those instances, the Legislature might 1 have intended to use the cross-reference to Section 6254 2 (sometimes coupled with a cross-reference to another code 3 provision) as a shorthand way of referring to all of the CPRA 4 exemptions generally, or at least all of the exemptions located in 5 the CPRA itself.90 6 That approach may have worked in the past, but Section 6254 no 7 longer contains all (or even almost all) of the CPRA exemptions. 8 Consequently, a cross-reference to \"Section 6254\" is 9 underinclusive and thus imperfect as a means of referring to all of 10 the exemptions codified in the CPRA, much less all of the CPRA 11 exemptions that are sprinkled throughout the codes. 12 The Legislature may therefore wish to: 13 (1) Revisit each statute that cross-refers to Section 6254 14 (or \"the provisions listed in proposed Section 15 7920.505\"). 16 (2) Assess in each instance whether the intent was, or 17 should be, to cross-refer to all of the CPRA 18 exemptions. 19 89.

See generally CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-47, Exhibit p. 7 (suggestion of California News Publishers Ass'n that \"it may be appropriate to consider whether the Legislature needs to make minor substantive changes to the CPRA, and other laws that reference Section 6254, to instead make a more general reference to records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA.\"); see also id. at 15-17 (staff analysis of that suggestion). 92. See AB 378 (Lim\u00f3n), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 385, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 29; AB 857 (Chiu), 2019 Cal.

Stat. ch. 581, 6 (amending, repealing & adding Penal Code \u00a7 13202). Many other provisions in the CPRA index were also revised in 2019, but not in a manner relevant to how they are described in the index. See, e.g., Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 30; Fam. Code \u00a7 3111; Labor Code \u00a7 432.7. Recent legislation also added some new CPRA exemptions to the codes. Consistent with its general approach to the CPRA index, the Commission did not incorporate those new exemptions into the index. That could be done in a follow-up study comprehensively updating the index. See supra note 74. 2019] RECOMMENDATION 235 When a legislator introduces a bill to implement this 1 recommendation, there might be conflicts between that bill and 2 other bills that are pending or subsequently introduced (i.e., two 3 bills might try to revise the same code provision in different ways). 4 If so, the Commission will recommend double-jointing 5 amendments or other steps to eliminate the conflicts and 6 coordinate the bills. Similar steps may be appropriate with regard 7 to a bill that affects a provision listed in the CPRA index. Any such 8 adjustments will be consistent with the nonsubstantive nature of 9 this study. 10 Delayed Operative Date 11 Because of the breadth of the organizational changes that would 12 be made by the proposed legislation, the Commission recommends 13 that it be given a delayed operative date. The proposed legislation 14 includes an uncodified provision to that effect, which would delay 15 the operation of the proposed law by one year (i.e., until January 1, 16 2022).94 17 This delayed operation would provide time for those who work 18 closely with the affected statutes, including legal publishers, to 19 adjust to the new organizational scheme before it takes effect. The 20 Commission's comments and the disposition and derivation tables 21 in the Commission's report would also help ease the transition. 22 Although the proposed recodification would entail some 23 transitional costs (such as updating manuals and regulations), the 24 Commission believes that the long-term benefits of having a better 25 organized, more user-friendly statutory scheme would soon 26 outweigh those transitional costs. The CPRA would become more 27 readily accessible and understandable to laypersons and other 28 94. In general, a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor becomes operative on January 1 of the year after its enactment. See Cal. Const. art.

An official Commission \"Comment\" follows each code section in 1 the proposed recodification. The Comments indicate the source of each 2 recodified code section (or provision within the code section) and 3 describe how the recodified code section (or provision) compares with 4 the law before recodification. Courts have routinely held that the 5 Commission's Comments are evidence of legislative intent with regard 6 to any legislation that implements a Commission recommendation. 7 There is a \"disposition table\" at the end of the proposed recodification. 8 It summarizes, in tabular form, the disposition of every provision of the 9 existing code that has been included in this proposed recodification. 10 There is also a \"derivation table\" at the end of the proposed 11 recodification. It summarizes, in tabular form, the statutory derivation of 12 every new code provision in this proposed recodification. 13 Almost all of the proposed provisions would be located in the 14 Government Code. All references are to the Government Code unless 15 otherwise indicated. 16 Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48 (repealed). California Public Records 17 Act 18 SEC. ___.

This division shall be known and may be cited as the 5 California Public Records Act. 6 Comment. Section 7920.000 continues former Section 6251 without 7 substantive change. The California Public Records Act or \"CPRA\" was 8 formerly codified as Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of 9 Division 7 of this title. 10 For a similar law pertaining to federal agencies, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 11 (\"Freedom of Information Act\" or \"FOIA\"). 12 For a key constitutional provision on \"access to information 13 concerning the conduct of the people's business,\" see Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 14 3(b). For legislative findings and declarations underlying the CPRA, see 15 Section 7921.000. For an alphabetical index of many CPRA exemptions 16 (most of which are located outside the CPRA), see Sections 7930.000- 17 7930.215. 18 For guidance on access to legislative records, see Sections 9070-9080 19 (\"Legislative Open Records Act\"). For discussion of provisions and 20 doctrines governing access to judicial records, see, e.g., NBC Subsidiary 21 (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court, 20 Cal. 4th 1178, 980 P.2d 337, 86 22 Cal.

See also Sections 12270-12279 (State Records Management 30 Act). 31 Many other statutes and sources of law govern public records. For 32 instance, the following statutes are located in Division 7 of this title, 33 2019] PROPOSED LEGISLATION 251 where the CPRA was formerly codified: Sections 6200-6203 (crimes 1 relating to public records, documents and certificates), 6204-6204.4 2 (public records protection and recovery), 6205-6210 (address 3 confidentiality for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and 4 stalking), 6215-6216 (address confidentiality for reproductive health care 5 service providers, employees, volunteers, and patients), 6219 6 (governmental linguistics). 7 \u00a7 7920.005. CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 8 7920.005. This division recodifies the provisions of former 9 Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of this 10 title. The act that added this division, and the act that consists of 11 conforming revisions to reflect the addition of this division, shall 12 be known and may be cited as the \"CPRA Recodification Act of 13 2020.\" 14 Comment. Section 7920.005 is new. It provides a convenient means 15 of referring to the recodification of former Sections 6250-6276.48. For 16 background, see California Public Records Act Clean-Up, 46 Cal. L. 17 Revision Comm'n Reports 207 (2019). 18 Article 2. Effect of Recodification 19 \u00a7 7920.100. Nonsubstantive reform 20 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is 21 intended to substantively change the law relating to inspection of 22 public records. The act is intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in 23 effect. Every provision of this division and every other provision 24 of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-reference in 25 every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 26 nonsubstantive intent of the act. 27 Comment. Section 7920.100 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code 28 Section 16005. It makes clear that the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 29 has no substantive impact. The act is intended solely to make the 30 California Public Records Act more user-friendly. For background, see 31 California Public Records Act Clean-Up, 46 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 32 Reports 207 (2019). 33 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting 34 a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.110.

Continuation of existing law 8 7920.105. (a) A provision of this division, or any other provision 9 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, insofar as it is 10 substantially the same as a previously existing provision relating to 11 the same subject matter, shall be considered as a restatement and 12 continuation thereof and not as a new enactment. 13 (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that 14 is restated and continued in this division, or in any other provision 15 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, shall, unless a contrary 16 intent appears, be deemed a reference to the restatement and 17 continuation. 18 (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this division, or any 19 other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which is 20 substantially the same as a previously existing provision, shall, 21 unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed to include a reference 22 to the previously existing provision. 23 Comment. Section 7920.105 is new. Subdivision (a) is similar to 24 Section 2, which is a standard provision found in many codes. See, e.g., 25 Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 2; Corp. Code \u00a7 2; Code \u00a7 2(a); Veh. Code \u00a7 2. 27 Subdivision (b) is drawn from Section 9604 and Penal Code Section 28 16010(b). 29 Subdivision (c) is drawn from Family Code Section 2 and Penal Code 30 Section 16010(c). 31 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 32 \u00a7 7920.110.

Section 7920.110 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code 9 Section 16020. 10 Subdivision (a) makes clear that case law construing a predecessor 11 provision is relevant in construing its successor in the CPRA 12 Recodification Act of 2020. 13 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former 14 Sections 6250-6276.48, the Legislature has not taken any position on any 15 case interpreting any of those provisions. 16 For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney General opinion 17 interpreting a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 18 7920.115. For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision or 19 Attorney General opinion assessing the constitutionality of a predecessor 20 of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.120.

(a) An opinion of the Attorney General interpreting a 26 previously existing provision is relevant in interpreting any 27 provision of this division, or any other provision of the CPRA 28 Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that 29 previously existing provision. 30 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, 31 the Legislature has not evaluated the correctness of any Attorney 32 General opinion interpreting a provision affected by the act. 33 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and 34 does not, reflect any assessment of any Attorney General opinion 35 interpreting any provision affected by the act. 36 254 CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP [Vol. 46 Comment. Section 7920.115 is new. It is comparable to Section 1 7920.110, but it pertains to Attorney General opinions rather than 2 judicial decisions. 3 Subdivision (a) makes clear that Attorney General opinions construing 4 a predecessor provision are relevant in construing its successor in the 5 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 6 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former 7 Sections 6250-6276.48, the Legislature has not taken any position on any 8 Attorney General opinion interpreting any of those provisions. 9 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting 10 a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.110.

Section 7920.120 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code 33 Section 16025. Due to the prevalence and significant impact of Attorney 34 General opinions on CPRA issues, the section expressly refers to 35 Attorney General opinions as well as judicial decisions. 36 Subdivision (a) makes clear that case law and Attorney General 37 opinions on the constitutionality of a predecessor provision are relevant 38 2019] PROPOSED LEGISLATION 255 in determining the constitutionality of its successor in the CPRA 1 Recodification Act of 2020. 2 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former 3 Sections 6250-6276.48, the Legislature has not taken any position on the 4 constitutionality of any of those provisions. 5 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting 6 a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.110.

The provisions of this division shall not be deemed in 15 any manner to affect the status of judicial records as it existed 16 immediately before the effective date of the provision that is 17 continued in this section, nor to affect the rights of litigants, 18 including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of 19 discovery of this state, nor to limit or impair any rights of 20 discovery in a criminal case. 21 Comment. Section 7920.200 continues former Section 6260 without 22 substantive change. 23 Former Section 6260 was enacted in 1968 (see 1968 Cal. Stat. ch. 24 1473, \u00a7 39) and amended in 1976 to insert the phrase \"nor to limit or 25 impair any rights of discovery in a criminal case\" (see 1976 Cal. Stat. ch. 26 314, \u00a7 2).

Video or audio recording relating to critical incident 7 7923.625. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, 8 commencing July 1, 2019, a video or audio recording that relates 9 to a critical incident, as defined in subdivision (e), may be withheld 10 only as follows: 11 (a)(1) During an active criminal or administrative investigation, 12 disclosure of a recording related to a critical incident may be 13 delayed for no longer than 45 calendar days after the date the 14 agency knew or reasonably should have known about the incident, 15 if, based on the facts and circumstances depicted in the recording, 16 disclosure would substantially interfere with the investigation, such 17 as by endangering the safety of a witness or a confidential source. 18 If an agency delays disclosure pursuant to this section, the agency 19 shall provide in writing to the requester the specific basis for the 20 agency's determination that disclosure would substantially 21 interfere with the investigation and the estimated date for 22 disclosure. 23 (2) After 45 days from the date the agency knew or reasonably 24 should have known about the incident, and up to one year from 25 that date, the agency may continue to delay disclosure of a 26 recording if the agency demonstrates that disclosure would 27 substantially interfere with the investigation. After one year from 28 the date the agency knew or reasonably should have known about 29 the incident, the agency may continue to delay disclosure of a 30 recording only if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing 31 evidence that disclosure would substantially interfere with the 32 investigation.

The agency shall reassess 2 withholding and notify the requester every 30 days. A recording 3 withheld by the agency shall be disclosed promptly when the 4 specific basis for withholding is resolved. 5 (b)(1) If the agency demonstrates, on the facts of the particular 6 case, that the public interest in withholding a video or audio 7 recording clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure 8 because the release of the recording would, based on the facts and 9 circumstances depicted in the recording, violate the reasonable 10 expectation of privacy of a subject depicted in the recording, the 11 agency shall provide in writing to the requester the specific basis 12 for the expectation of privacy and the public interest served by 13 withholding the recording and may use redaction technology, 14 including blurring or distorting images or audio, to obscure those 15 specific portions of the recording that protect that interest. 16 However, the redaction shall not interfere with the viewer's ability 17 to fully, completely, and accurately comprehend the events 18 captured in the recording and the recording shall not otherwise be 19 edited or altered. 20 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the agency 21 demonstrates that the reasonable expectation of privacy of a 22 subject depicted in the recording cannot adequately be protected 23 through redaction as described in paragraph (1) and that interest 24 outweighs the public interest in disclosure, the agency may 25 withhold the recording from the public, except that the recording, 26 either redacted as provided in paragraph (1) or unredacted, shall be 27 disclosed promptly, upon request, to any of the following: 28 (A) The subject of the recording whose privacy is to be 29 protected, or the subject's authorized representative. 30 (B) If the subject is a minor, the parent or legal guardian of the 31 subject whose privacy is to be protected. 32 (C) If the subject whose privacy is to be protected is deceased, 33 an heir, beneficiary, designated immediate family member, or 34 authorized legal representative of the deceased subject whose 35 privacy is to be protected. 36 2019] PROPOSED LEGISLATION 323 (3) If disclosure pursuant to paragraph (2) would substantially 1 interfere with an active criminal or administrative investigation, 2 the agency shall provide in writing to the requester the specific 3 basis for the agency's determination that disclosure would 4 substantially interfere with the investigation, and provide the 5 estimated date for the disclosure of the video or audio recording. 6 Thereafter, the recording may be withheld by the agency for 45 7 calendar days, subject to extensions as set forth in paragraph (2) of 8 subdivision (a). 9 (c) An agency may provide greater public access to video or 10 audio recordings than the minimum standards set forth in this 11 section. 12 (d) For purposes of this section, a peace officer does not include 13 any peace officer employed by the Department of Corrections and 14 Rehabilitation. 15 (e) For purposes of this section, a video or audio recording 16 relates to a critical incident if it depicts any of the following 17 incidents: 18 (1) An incident involving the discharge of a firearm at a person 19 by a peace officer or custodial officer. 20 (2) An incident in which the use of force by a peace officer or 21 custodial officer against a person resulted in death or in great 22 bodily injury. 23 (f) This section does not alter, limit, or negate any other rights, 24 remedies, or obligations with respect to public records regarding an 25 incident other than a critical incident as described in subdivision 26 (e). 27 Comment.

OTHER EXEMPTIONS FROM DISCLOSURE CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS 1 \u00a7 7930.000. Legislative intent and instructions 2 7930.000. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to assist members 3 of the public and state and local agencies in identifying exemptions 4 to the California Public Records Act. It is the intent of the 5 Legislature that, after January 1, 1999, each addition or 6 amendment to a statute that exempts any information contained in 7 a public record from disclosure pursuant to Section 7927.705 shall 8 be listed and described in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 9 7930.100) pursuant to a bill authorized by a standing committee of 10 the Legislature to be introduced during the first year of each 11 session of the Legislature. 12 (b) The statutes and constitutional provisions listed in Chapter 2 13 (commencing with Section 7930.100) may operate to exempt 14 certain records, or portions thereof, from disclosure. The statutes 15 and constitutional provisions listed and described may not be 16 inclusive of all exemptions. The listing of a statute or 17 constitutional provision in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 18 7930.100) does not itself create an exemption. Requesters of public 19 records and public agencies are cautioned to review the applicable 20 statute or constitutional provision to determine the extent to which 21 it, in light of the circumstances surrounding the request, exempts 22 public records from disclosure. 23 Comment. Section 7930.000 continues former Section 6275 without 24 substantive change. 25 For additional guidance on using the alphabetical list in the next 26 chapter (Sections 7930.100-7930.215), see Section 7930.005 (scope and 27 effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 28 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 29 7923.600-7929.610. For the CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section See Scope and effect of index 1 7930.005. Records or information not required to be disclosed 2 pursuant to Section 7927.705 may include, but shall not be limited 3 to, records or information identified in statutes listed in Chapter 2 4 (commencing with Section 7930.100). 5 Comment.

Section 7930.100 continues former Section 6276.01 and 24 includes a reference to the constitutional right of privacy, which is 25 fundamental in this context (see Section 7921.000). That addition is not a 26 substantive change. The alphabetical list in this chapter is just a user 27 guide, not substantive law. 28 For the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of 29 former Section 6275 (\"The statutes and constitutional provisions listed in 30 this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, 31 from disclosure.\").

Section 6276.12 includes an entry for: \"Controlled substance 3 offenders, confidentiality of registration information, Section 11594, 4 Health and Safety Code.\" A recently-enacted bill (operative Jan. 1, 2020) 5 repeals Health and Safety Code Section 11594 and adds a new provision 6 with the same number. See 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. ch. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (AB 1261 7 (Jones-Sawyer)). The new provision includes a confidentiality 8 requirement similar to the one in the repealed provision. Accordingly, 9 proposed Section 7930.130 (the proposed recodification of Section 10 6276.12) includes the same entry for Health and Safety Code Section 11 11594 as in Section 6276.12. 12 Section 6276.12 also includes an entry for: \"Criminal offender record 13 information, access to, Sections 11076 and 13202, Penal Code.\" A 14 recently-enacted bill amends Penal Code Section 13202 to include a 15 sunset clause, which would repeal the provision on July 1, 2020. That 16 bill also adds a new version of Penal Code Section 13202 to the codes, 17 with an operative date of July 1, 2020. See 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 581, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 18 6 (AB 1331 (Bonta)). Although the bill creates two versions of Penal 19 Code Section 13202, they contain similar language regarding 20 confidentiality and one of them would be repealed by its own terms 21 before the operative date of this proposed recodification. Thus, proposed 22 Section 7930.130 (like existing Section 6276.12) would simply refer to 23 Penal Code Section 13202. 24 \u00a7 7930.135.

Section 7930.185 continues former Section 6276.36 5 without substantive change. For the source of the introductory clause, see 6 the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes and 7 constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt 8 certain records, or portions thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is 9 continued without substantive change in Section 7930.000 and 10 essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 11 Former Section 6276.36 included an entry for: \"Public Employees' 12 Retirement System, confidentiality of data filed by member or 13 beneficiary with board of administration, Section 20134.\" That entry has 14 been revised because Section 20134 was repealed and its substance 15 moved to Section 20230. See 1995 Cal. Stat. ch. 379, \u00a7 1; compare 1985 16 Cal. Stat. ch. 1508, \u00a7 1 with Section 20230. Section 7930.185 would thus 17 refer to Section 20230, instead of Section 20134. 18 Former Section 6276.36 also included an entry for: \"Pupil records, 19 disclosure in hearing to dismiss or suspend school employee, Section 20 44944.1, Education Code.\" That entry has been revised because Section 21 44944.1 was repealed and added, and the new provision does not address 22 record disclosure (see 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18). The substance 23 of the repealed provision has been moved to Education Code Section 24 44944.3 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 324, \u00a7 3 (former Code \u00a7 Educ. Code \u00a7 44944.3). Proposed Section 7930.135 would 26 thus refer to Education Code Section 44944.3, instead of Education Code 27 Section 44944.1. 28 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative 29 intent & instructions) and 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Stat. ch. 1096, \u00a7 5). 10 Both versions require a residential care facility for the elderly to keep 11 and protect \"the privacy and confidentiality of\" certain records. Most of 12 the differences between the versions are stylistic, but only the first 13 version applies to \"the ... address ... of the client's physician ....\" 14 Like existing Section 6276.38, proposed Section 7930.190 would 15 simply refer to \"Section 1569.315, Health and Safety Code.\" 16 \u00a7 7930.195. From \"Safe surrender site\" to \"Social security numbers 17 within records of local agencies\" 18 7930.195.

For 3 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former 4 Section 6275 (\"The statutes and constitutional provisions listed in this 5 article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, from 6 disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in 7 Section 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 8 Former Section 6276.38 consisted of entries beginning with \"R,\" plus 9 an entry for: \"Safe surrender site, confidentiality of information 10 pertaining to a parent or individual surrendering a child, Section 1255.7, 11 Health and Safety Code.\" The quoted entry belongs with other entries 12 that begin with \"S,\" not with entries that begin with \"R.\" Thus, the 13 quoted entry is recodified here in Section 7930.195, not in Section 14 7930.190. 15 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative 16 intent & instructions) and 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For 17 special rules in the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") that apply 18 to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.610. For 19 the CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 20 Note. Existing Section 6276.40 includes an entry for: \"Social security 21 number, applicant for driver's license or identification card, 22 nondisclosure of, Section 1653.5, Vehicle Code ....\" At present, there are 23 two versions of Vehicle Code Section 1653.5, with different rules 24 governing when they are operative: (1) 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 452, \u00a7 2, and 25 (2) 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 71, \u00a7 168. Both versions restrict disclosure of the 26 social security number of an applicant for a driver's license or 27 identification card.

The reference to Education Code Section 26215 is 7 obsolete because that section was repealed as redundant.

That sentence is 7 continued without substantive change in Section 7930.000 and 8 essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 9 Former Section 6276.44 included an entry for: \"Trust companies, 10 disclosure of private trust confidential information, Section 1582, 11 Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised because Financial Code 12 Section 1582 was repealed in 2011 and replaced by a new provision that 13 has nothing to do with disclosure of private trust confidential information 14 (see 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 243, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3). The substance of the repealed 15 provision was moved to Financial Code Section 1602 (compare former 16 Fin. Code \u00a7 1582 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 212) with Fin. Code \u00a7 17 1602).

Section 7930.215 continues former Section 6276.48 12 without substantive change. For the source of the introductory clause, see 13 the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes and 14 constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt 15 certain records, or portions thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is 16 continued without substantive change in Section 7930.000 and 17 essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 18 Former Section 6276.46 consisted of entries beginning with \"U\" and 19 \"V,\" plus an entry for: \"Wards and dependent children, inspection of 20 juvenile court documents, Section 827, Welfare and Institutions Code.\" 21 The quoted entry belongs with other entries that begin with \"W,\" not 22 with entries that begin with \"U\" or \"V.\" Thus, the quoted entry is 23 recodified here in Section 7930.215, not in Section 7930.210. 24 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative 25 intent & instructions) and 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

This act would recodify the California Public 32 Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of 33 Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code) in a more user- 34 friendly manner without changing its substance, and make 35 conforming revisions. Consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 3 36 2019] PROPOSED LEGISLATION 519 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature finds and 1 declares: 2 (a) This act continues the existing substantive balance between 3 the public's right of access to information concerning the conduct 4 of public business and competing interests. This act does not 5 impose any new limitation on the public's right of access, which 6 would require findings demonstrating the interest protected by the 7 new limitation and the need for protecting that interest. 8 (b) By making the California Public Records Act more user- 9 friendly, this act furthers the public's right of access to information 10 concerning the conduct of public business. 11 Operative date 12 SEC. ____.

Where the proper cross-reference is obvious, the 4 Commission corrected the cross-reference in its proposed 5 legislation. That approach seems more sensible than proposing to 6 perpetuate a plainly incorrect cross-reference. 7 Those instances are described in detail below. 8 Section 6252(a), defining \"local agency,\" cross- 9 refers to \"subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 10 54952.\"1 It seems improbable, however, that the 11 Legislature intended to require an entity to satisfy 12 the requirements of both subdivisions to qualify as 13 a \"local agency\" under Section 6252(a) for 14 purposes of the CPRA. Proposed Section 15 7920.510 (continuing the substance of Section 16 6252(a)) would correct this problem by referring 17 instead to \"subdivision (c) or (d) of Section 18 54952.\"2 19 Section 6253.2 cross-refers to Welfare and 20 Institutions Code Section 12302.25. The 2018 21 maintenance of the codes bill amended Section 22 6253.2 to cross-refer to Welfare and Institutions 23 Code Section 12302.25 instead of Section 24 12302.5,3 but that amendment was chaptered out 25 by another bill.4 Proposed Section 7926.300 26 would incorporate the cross-reference correction 27 1.

Proposed Sections 7924.105 8 (continuing the substance of Section 6253.5(d)) 9 and 7924.110 (continuing the substance of Section 10 6253.5(a)-(b)) would correct that problem. 11 In two places, Section 6253.5 cross-refers to \"Part 12 46 (commencing with Section 74000) of the 13 Education Code.\" Those cross-references are 14 incomplete; they do not indicate that Part 46 is 15 located in Division 7 of Title 3 of the Education 16 Code. Proposed Sections 7924.105 (continuing 17 the substance of Section 6253.5(d)) and 7924.110 18 (continuing the substance of Section 6253.5(a)- 19 (b)) would correct that problem. 20 Section 6254(f) contains two cross-references to 21 Penal Code Section 288a. In 2018, Penal Code 22 Section 288a was renumbered as Penal Code 23 Section 287.5 Proposed Sections 7923.615 and 24 7923.620 would continue the part of Section 25 6254(f) in question, with revisions to reflect the 26 renumbering of Penal Code Section 288a. 27 Paragraphs (1) and (2) of Section 6254(v) cross- 28 refer to \"Part 6.6 (commencing with Section 29 12739.5), or Part 6.7 (commencing with Section 30 12739.70) of Division 2 of the Insurance Code.\" 31 Those parts of the Insurance Code have been 32 repealed.6 Proposed Section 7926.225(a)-(b) 33 5.

Proposed Section 7929.400 (continuing 12 the substance of Section 6254(ad)(1) would 13 correct that problem. 14 Section 6254.4(c) refers to \"the federal Help 15 America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C.

Proposed Section 7924.000(b) 20 (continuing the substance of 6254.4(c)) would 21 update the cross-reference to reflect the 22 relocation. 23 Section 6254.7(d) cross-refers to \"Chapter 3 24 (commencing with Section 99150) of Part 65 of 25 the Education Code.\" That cross-reference is 26 incomplete; it does not indicate that Part 65 is 27 located in Division 14 of Title 3 of the Education 28 Code. Proposed Section 7924.510(c) (continuing 29 the substance of the first sentence of Section 30 6254.7(d)) would correct that problem. 31 Section 6254.18(f) says: \"Within 90 days of 32 separation of an employee, contractor, volunteer, 33 board member, or officer of the reproductive 34 health service facility who has provided notice to 35 7.

Proposed Section 5 7926.425 would correct that problem by cross- 6 referring to the provision that would continue the 7 substance of subdivision (d) of Section 6254.18 8 (proposed Section 7926.415), instead of the 9 provision that would continue the substance of 10 subdivision (c). 11 In defining \"public safety official,\" Section 12 6254.24(b) refers to a \"public officer or other 13 person listed in Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6 of the 14 Vehicle Code.\"9 Given the content of Sections 15 1808.2 and 1808.6, however, it seems improbable 16 that the Legislature intended to require a person to 17 be listed in both of those provisions to qualify as a 18 \"public safety official\" within the meaning of 19 Section 6254.24. Proposed Section 7920.535(b) 20 (continuing the substance of Section 6254.24(b)) 21 would correct that problem by referring to 22 \"Section 1808.2 or 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\"10 23 Section 6254.24(g) includes as a \"public safety 24 official\" an employee \"who supervises inmates in 25 a city police department, a county sheriff's office, 26 the Department of California Highway Patrol, 27 federal, state, or a local detention facility, and a 28 local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home ....\"11 It 29 seems improbable that the Legislature intended 30 this provision to include as a \"public safety 31 8.

MINOR CLEAN-UP ISSUES 1 FOR POSSIBLE 2 FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION 3 In conducting this strictly nonsubstantive study, the Commission 4 identified some minor problems in the CPRA, which it probably 5 could not address without potentially raising concerns about the 6 possibility of a substantive change. Those issues are listed here. 7 As far as the Commission is aware, this list consists of relatively 8 noncontroversial clean-up issues, not issues involving substantial 9 controversy. If any of the issues listed below appears likely to 10 involve substantial controversy, please notify the Commission. 11 Consider whether to clarify the usage of the term 12 \"local agency\" in Section 6252.7 and its continuation 13 (proposed Section 7921.310).1 14 Consider whether Section 6254(j) (proposed Section 15 7927.100) and Section 6267 (proposed Section 16 7927.105) are redundant to some extent and, if so, 17 how to eliminate such redundancy.2 18 Consider whether the second sentence of Section 19 6254.2(b) (the second sentence of proposed Section 20 7924.305) should be relocated to the chapter on 21 pesticides within the Food and Agricultural Code3 22 and, if so, where it should be placed within that 23 chapter.4 24 1.
