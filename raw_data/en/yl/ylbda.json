Reiki - Energy Healing What is Reiki? Reiki is a Japanese energy healing technique. The predominate form of reiki practiced throughout the world today, also known as Usui reiki, was created by Dr. Mikao Usui in the early 20th century. It's a complementary or alternative health approach. Reiki does not directly cure diseases or illnesses. Instead, it's used as a way to manage symptoms and improve general well-being. During a reiki session, the practitioner places their hands either directly on you or just above you to bring about healing. The belief is that the practitioner is able to stimulate your body's natural healing abilities. Private Reiki Session 55 minutes | $175 The Chakra system begins at the base of the spine and moves through each chakra to the top of the head. Each chakra is associated with color, shape, different aspects of life, glands, physical and psychological challenges, and much more. Reiki transmutes life force energy into a spiritual evolution at a higher consciousness. Let go of low lying energies which no longer serve you. Reiki Circles Twice a month we offer Reiki Circles in the Salt Cave, this differs from a private Reiki Session and is rather a collective healing of the participants attending.
