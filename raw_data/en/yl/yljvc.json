However, a lot of people still rely on Allopathic medicine and it is largely because they are unaware of the [benefits of naturopathy](http://www.nirvananaturopathy.com/) and how it can dramatically boost health and well-being. There are also some myths doing the rounds regarding naturopathy that makes people refer to naturopaths when Western medicine has failed them. So, take a look below to better know what naturopathy is all about... Myth #1: Anybody can be a naturopath This is an outright lie because everybody cannot become a naturopath out of the blue! Yes, naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine that implements non-surgical and natural techniques, but it takes years for someone to actually become a qualified naturopath. This is an ancient form of medicine and it takes years of practice. Learning the right combination of herbs, the proper form of massage, the ideal yoga for the body, the correct diet and so on takes time and patience. When in search of naturopaths, one must only go to certified naturopathic doctors and such wellness and retreat centers that work with qualified naturopaths. One improper massage can be fatal! Myth #2: Homeopath and naturopath mean the same thing A naturopath and a homeopath are different from each other. For starters, homeopaths only use homeopathy as a treatment tool, which is dilute medicines placed on sugar pills. Naturopathic doctors, on the other hand, may or may not use homeopathy as one of the many treatment tools. Also, naturopathy is more dependent on an array of pseudoscientific practices combined with yoga, meditation, massages and so on. Myth #3: Naturopathic is not scientific Naturopathy is based on science and there is a growing body of scientific evidence supporting naturopathic medicine, along with medicines and therapies. In fact, naturopathic medicine is becoming more and more a mainstream choice of healthcare. [Naturopathic doctors](http://www.nirvananaturopathy.com/) rely on clinical observations, logical analysis, traditional medical knowledge and physical exam. The main concern of [naturopaths](http://www.nirvananaturopathy.com/) is to get to the root of the problem and not just treat the symptoms by making use of lifestyle and diet modifications that are effective and safe. Myth #4: Naturopathic treatment is unsafe The safety record of naturopathic treatment, therapies and medicine is simply excellent. This makes complete sense given that naturopathy lays emphasis on non-invasive, gentle treatments that is devoid of any side effects, such as light exercises, diet and lifestyle changes, yoga and meditation, acupuncture and acupressure, massages, sauna and other such natural therapies. Myth #5: Naturopathic treatment is not effective This myth mainly exists because people mainly do not understand what naturopathy is or what it does. People are so inclined to popping pills when something bothers them, from a slight headache to feeling under stress that they think anything natural is not going to help them. Yes, the thing is that naturopathy medicine and technique is going to take some time to kick in. You need to be a little patient. However, once naturopathy does start to work, it will not only treat the symptoms, but the root cause of the problem. Naturopathy takes a holistic approach towards healing. Myth #6: Naturopaths are not able to treat serious conditions Naturopathy is proven to cure a number of acute and even long-standing health conditions, such as jaundice, diabetes, arthritis and more. It is also one of the most effective treatments for obesity. Along with curing health issues, naturopathy aims to enhance one's overall quality of life. So, now that you know how naturopathy can really help you to become healthier and fitter, it is time to visit a wellness and retreat center for at least a week. You will find the difference it does to your life and mood. Even if you are not particularly suffering from any illness, but just feeling a bit frustrated with everything or under a lot of pressure, these wellness centers offering a combination of lush green and goodness of naturopathy will make you feel relaxed, rejuvenated and alive.
