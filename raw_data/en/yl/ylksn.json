I found Dr. Alex Vazquez one of the top doctors in the field of functional virology. We are now including his strategies as part of our recommendations to our patients in our Sunrise and Downtown Miami Offices. Many people suffer from many kinds of viruses that don't have a vaccine or a specific drug to cure it, such as Herpes, West Nile Virus, and Dengue Fever. The specialty of functional virology looks at the type of virus, then through clinical experience and scientific studies devises protocols that improve immunity, prevent infection, and in the event of infection prevent viral replication. [Functional medicine](https://drlisaowen.com/functional-medicine/) uses mostly nutritional supplements herbs that have been scientifically proven to improve the function of your immune system and other critical systems to reduce your risk of fatality. Allopathic medicine looks for a particular drug or vaccine for each specific pathogen. A lot of people can die before the vaccine, or the drug becomes available. This is part of his recommendations for dealing with C-19. I did find may other recommendations, from many other qualified functional medicine practitioners. However, Dr. Vazquez is the most qualified physician, I could find. He has decades of clinical experience treating patients with all types of viral infections. I am re-posting his protocol. I chose practice over theory. There is a difference between thinking something is going to work or having the experience of it working over and over again. This list is here to give you an idea of what you need to have on hand if you get infected. It is beginning to look more like when you get infected. You may have health conditions that handling them would be one of the best ways to improve your immune system. Selenium 200 mcg per day - 600-800 if infected [Vitamin D3](https://drlisaowen.com/what-we-learned-from-the-flu-of-1918-why-the-amnesia/), 2,000-5,000 preventative 50,000 per day if infected for 3 days then back to 10k per day Zinc 20-30 mg per day 2 times per day if infected Melatonin 3 mg per day Whey protein isolate - see bottom of the page Licorice - Sip and enjoy licorice tea Viamin D 5,000-10,000 per day, 50,000 per day if infected for 3 days then back to 10k per day. Please use our vitamin D. I have not seen anything but a professional grade vitamin D increase blood levels of vitamin D for 20 years. Vitamin D is critical for your survival should you get infected. Alpha Lipoic Acid - 300 mg per day, 300 mg per every 4 hours if infected Glutathione 100-250 mg per day - Glutathione and N-Acetyl Cystine are just one biochemical reaction away from each other. NAC is much less expensive. If you are infected you may not be able to swallow anything so using emulsions and liposomals enable you to get a lot of supplements in without having to swallow. It is more expensive, save money by taking NAC for prevention, but have the liposomal glutathione on hand in case of infection. Vitamin C 1 gram per day prevention one gram per hour if infected NAC 500-1500 per day up to 8,000 per day if infected Vitamin A 1500 mg per day. During acute infection, Dr. Vasquez, recommends using 300,000 IU for 3-5 days and followed by 30 -50k per day until well. This heads of infection from becoming more severe. This amount is so high that some organizations refused to publish his recommendation. This is due to their lack of training or experience in nutritional protocols. Lysine 1 to 3 grams per day as a side note, many people take arginine supplements for heart disease. Viruses love it and it aids viral replication. Resveratrol 250 mg per day if acute 1,000, 2 times per day. Avoid Licorice if suffering from hypertension. None of these statements have been approved by the FDA but studies on the efficacy of these supplements may be found on the NIH's own website. You probably have many effective supplements at home already just google them along with the word influenza. Your body has been making antibodies since the day you were born.

You can still get a lot of protection without spending a lot. The Doctor that formulated this took a different approach and felt that the vitamin Bs were more important for immunity. They also added beta-glucan and some probiotic proprietary blends. In one small product you have all the D, Selenium, and Zinc recommended by experts to protect yourself. You could Add Ultra Virex or Kapparest to that. Ultra Virex is very strong great to carry around in case you get infected. Remember people just feel bad and then suddenly die. Kapparest can be used for everyday protection and will be effective if you get infected as this virus has to take the inflammatory pathway in order to replicate and the ingredients in this product will reduce inflammation as well as help block viral replication. Licorice is powerful too however, it is to be avoided with hypertension. HOW MUCH PROTEIN DO YOU NEED TO FIGHT A VIRUS? Dr. Vazques says about as much as a training athlete. "}
