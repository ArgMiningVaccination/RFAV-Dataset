To achieve the goals of the EHE initiative, HAB understands we must continue to promote health equity to reduce HIV-related health disparities; be innovative in how we deliver HIV care and treatment and support services to people with HIV; and ensure that people with HIV and their communities are involved in the planning, development, and implementation of HIV care and treatment service delivery. HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau hosts the NRWC every two years to deliver program and policy updates, share innovative models of care, and provide training and technical assistance to Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipients; federal, national, state, and local stakeholders; health care and service delivery providers; and people with HIV. This biennial event provides a forum to share best practices and innovative strategies that will help participants continue to implement a coordinated national response to reduce new HIV infections and HIV-related health disparities. I am especially looking forward to the 2022 NRWC this year because we will have the opportunity to highlight the incredible work of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, including all of our recipients and partners. I hope your participation in the 2022 NRWC will be rewarding. The 2022 NRWC offers a time for reflection of the past two years and an opportunity to highlight our collective resiliency as well as provide a productive exchange of valuable knowledge and information. Thank you for your commitment to providing high quality, comprehensive care and treatment to people with HIV and your efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States. Sincerely, Laura Cheever, M.D., Sc.M. Associate Administrator, HRSA HIV/AIDS BureauDear Colleague: On of the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), I look forward to your participation in the virtual 2022 National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care & Treatment (2022 NRWC) on August 23-26, 2022. The 2022 NRWC theme is \"The Time Is Now: Harnessing the Power of Innovation, Health Equity, and Community to End the HIV Epidemic.\" WELCOME National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care & Treatment | 20224Over the past two years, I have been reminded of so many parallels between the beginning of AIDS and the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. We thought in the beginning that HIV would not be around for very long. Many people thought the COVID-19 shut downs would last a couple of weeks. Before all the science on AIDS was out there - people believed it was airborne. At one of Ryan's first court hearings on attending school, a doctor testified that he would not let his children go to school with Ryan because Ryan had been diagnosed with AIDS. Thankfully, AIDS did not end up to be transmitted airborne. It has been wonderful to see the public health impact of education in the fight against COVID-19. COVID-19 has raised awareness about viruses. People used to be more complacent about their health. COVID-19 has been a wakeup call. People have become more aware by driving home the COVID-19 public health message that you have to be responsible for your own health. I want to stress the importance in continuing to talk about HIV. The recent advertisements introducing people on PrEP and HIV medications have raised the public's awareness. We need to continue to drive home the message to the general public on the importance of empowering communities to end the HIV epidemic. Educate about the risks, treatment that is available and taking responsibility for personal actions. We need to continue to get the message out that zero detectable is non-transmittable. Ryan used to say, \"We have to talk about sex, drugs and sexuality.\" He loved talking to kids and young adults because he felt they listened and were receptive to the message. When Senator Edward Kennedy called in 1990 to say they'd like to name the CARE Act after Ryan, we didn't think it would end up saving so many lives for so many years. I want to thank you for all you do daily to help people with HIV. Your continued good work makes all the difference! I am always so thrilled to attend this conference and to meet the people who dedicate themselves to fighting the HIV epidemic on the front lines. And, I know Ryan White would be proud of you all too! Sincerely, Jeanne White-GinderDear Attendees: Welcome to the 2022 National Ryan White HIV Care & Treatment Conference with the theme \"The Time is Now: Harnessing the Power of Innovation, Health Equity and Community to End the HIV Epidemic.\" National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care & Treatment | 20225 2022 CONFERENCE THEME & GOALSHRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) was named for a courageous young man who was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984, when he was 13 years old and living in Kokomo, Indiana. He was given six months to live. When he tried to return to school, he fought AIDS-related discrimination. Along with his mother, Jeanne White- Ginder, Ryan White rallied for his right to attend school, gained national attention, and became the face of AIDS. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted. He died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation and only months before Congress passed the legislation bearing his name in August 1990: the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. The theme of the 2022 National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care & Treatment is The Time is Now: Harnessing the Power of Innovation, Health Equity, and Community to End the HIV Epidemic. This theme reflects the urgency for ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S., while also highlighting the tools and resources we need to accomplish this goal. HRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program understands we must continue to promote health equity to reduce HIV-related health disparities; be innovative in how we deliver HIV care and treatment, support people with HIV; and ensure people with HIV and their communities are involved in the planning, development, and implementation of HIV care and treatment strategies. healthcare and service delivery providers.Bringing Together Those Who Live Out Ryan White's Legacy Each and Every Day Breaking Down Barriers Transitioning from in person to a virtual conference in 2022 is an opportunity to break down barriers and allows the NRWC's programming to reach more people than ever before. While HRSA's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program misses seeing our recipients and stakeholders in person, the NRWC is expected to break record attendance in 2022. In 2020, more than 7,000 attendees tuned into the online platform over the course of the conference dates. This year, that number is even larger.

People with HIV struggle to access oral health care. Adequate oral health care is especially important for persons living with HIV as they are often predisposed to oral health conditions and diseases such as caries, periodontal disease, oral lesions and xerostomia. Data from HRSA HAB suggest that a majority of people with HIV had not seen a dentist in more than two years. Barriers and lack of access to oral healthcare may significantly impact systemic health along with impacting quality of life. By improving the integration of oral health in primary care some of these oral health barriers can be addressed by (1) detecting disease at an earlier stage, (2) better educating patients on the importance of oral health and (3) connecting patients to dental care providers. By fully integrating the skills of dentists, physicians, nurses, and behaviorists, a patients' overall health can be improved with a concurrent reduction in overall healthcare costs.EXHIBITORS National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care & Treatment | 2022125RYAN WHITE HIV/AIDS PROGRAM BEST PRACTICES COMPILATION targethiv.org/bestpractices Primary Contact: Julie Hook Contact: bestpractices@jsi.com The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Best Practices Compilation gathers and shares what works to strengthen HIV care and services across the United States.
