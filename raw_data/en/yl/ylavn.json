As several features in this issue of Inside Surgery convey , we are achieving our mission by collaborating with others around the globe to develop, refine, and evaluate innovative technologies and therapies that promise to significantly improve care for patients worldwide. For example, we are the only hospital in the nation and one of just a few in the world to offer a pioneering real-time imaging technology \u2014 which we played a major role in developing \u2014 that gives vascular surgeons a dramatically enhanced view of the vasculature, making complex aneurysm repairs safer and available to more patients. We also are one of just a few hospitals nationwide evaluating several minimally invasive therapies for patients with late-stage emphysema, a particularly debilitating condition. Innovation does not just happen. It requires knowledge, careful observation, imagination, and a willingness to break free from usual linear thinking patterns. It is enhanced by interacting with people who have different points of view, who stimulate the flow of new ideas. And it requires resisting the temptation to settle for the first, and often inferior, solution to a problem and digging deeper for a creative, better alternative. The Department of Surgery fosters an environment where innovation is not only encouraged and supported but also celebrated. We do so because we believe that innovation is the key to achieving our mission of improving health and creating a brighter future for all. Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 3 bidmc.org/surgeryThe search to discover and validate the first-ever clinical biomarker to diagnose and treat pancreatic cancer is the foundation of a new cross-sector collaboration called Project Survival. The Department of Surgery; the biopharmaceutical company Berg Health; and the Pancreatic Cancer Research T eam (PCRT), which is managed by Cancer Research and Biostatistics (CRAB), announced recently they will work together to achieve this goal. According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 49,000 Americans were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2014, a disease with an abysmal five-year survival rate of less than seven percent. \"Pancreatic cancer is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States within five years, surpassing both breast and colon cancer,\" says Department of Surgery faculty member A. James Moser, MD, the driving force behind Project Survival and leader of the research team for Project Survival at BIDMC. \"Finding a biomarker will bring real hope to patients with pancreatic cancer,\" says Dr. Moser. \"We believe that our collaboration with Berg and the Pancreatic Cancer Research T eam ushers in the dawn of precision medicine needed to beat this terrible disease. \" Each organization brings enormous capabilities to Project Survival. The BIDMC Pancreatic Cancer Center is home to one of the nation's foremost academic clinical and translational research programs for pancreatic cancer. The PCRT is a 48-site, multinational network of cancer centers and scientists dedicated to curing pancreatic cancer. Berg is a Framingham (Mass.)-based company with pharmaceutical, diagnostics, health analytics, and biosystems divisions and a research focus on understanding how alterations in metabolism relate to the onset of diseases, including cancer.

After graduating with highest distinction from Northwestern University Medical School in 1968, Dr. Manson interviewed at three of the most prestigious general surgery residency programs in the country , including the Fifth (Harvard) Surgical Service at New England Deaconess Hospital, the predecessor to the BIDMC General Surgery Residency Program. At the time, the \"Fifth\" was Dr. Manson's third choice and he was disappointed when he was not accepted into the other two. But nearly five decades and one illustrious, remarkably productive career later, Dr. Manson believes that not getting his wish was one of the best things that ever happened to him. \"I look back on my residency training and realize how it made me the person I am today ,\" says Dr. Manson, a full-time member of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Plastic Surgery . \"I learned so much from faculty mentors like [then Chief] Dr. William McDermott, Dr. Judah Folkman, and Dr. Frank W olfort, and also my fellow residents. I learned the importance of respecting patients and colleagues, to be honest about what works and what doesn't and changing how you do things based on that, and working hard as a member of a team to achieve the best outcomes. It's not about the facts or the technical details of surgery that stay with you from your residency training,\" he says, \"it's the lessons about how to conduct your life. How lucky I was to have been accepted into that program!\" Medal for heroism After his first year of residency , Dr. Manson served for nearly three years in the U.S. Army Medical Corps in Panama. During that time, he commanded the largest U.S. Army Health Clinic and received an Army Commendation medal for heroism after rescuing victims from a hospital following the 1972 earthquake in Nicaragua that killed more than 7 ,000 people. \"It was total devastation, with buildings collapsing everywhere,\" he recalls. \"Somehow I managed to not get killed while getting patients out of that crumbling hospital. \" Following his discharge from the Army in 1973 at the rank of major, Dr. Manson did another year of a surgical fellowship in colorectal surgery at Lahey Clinic before completing his general surgery training in the Harvard Fifth. Influenced and impressed by plastic surgeon Dr. W olfort, Dr. Manson decided to do his fellowship in plastic surgery at Johns Hopkins, where he has remained since completing the program in 1978. He was promoted to professor in 1987 . Highest honors During his tenure at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Manson has held many senior leadership roles and received some of the hospital's and medical school's highest honors. In 2012, for instance, he was named a Distinguished Service Professor by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, one of only 26 individuals and the only division chair in the 122-year history of the institution to be so recognized. He also was Director of the Johns Hopkins-University of Maryland accredited Fellowship in Craniofacial Surgery for 10 years, and for 16 years was Director of the Johns Hopkins-University of Maryland Plastic Surgery Program. During his early years at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Manson volunteered to cover nights for the plastic surgery service at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Unit. It was there that he became interested in traumatic facial injuries and how to treat them to achieve the best possible result. \"This became my quest,\" says Dr. Manson. Paul Manson, MD, '76 bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 5At the time (the late 1970s and early 1980s), trauma patients with severe facial injuries were treated first for their other injuries and only later, using closed techniques, for the injuries to their faces. \"But then, as now, with delayed treatment you can't get a good result,\" explains Dr. Manson, who pioneered the acute treatment of traumatic facial injuries. He also was among the first to recognize that open procedures to repair or replace bone, first using wires and later rigid fixation devices like plates and screws, were also critical to good outcomes. Revolutionizing treatment \"Early , open anatomic reduction [repair or replacement] of bone revolutionized facial fracture treatment,\" says Dr. Manson, whose classification of and algorithms for aesthetic reconstruction of facial defects from trauma and, later, cancer are now used by plastic surgeons worldwide. The fixation equipment and implants for facial and orbital fractures that Dr. Manson designed also had a far-reaching impact. Widely sought after for his expertise, Dr. Manson lectures internationally and has held leadership roles in many professional organizations, including serving as president of the American Association of Plastic Surgeons (AAPS), the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons, and the Association of Academic Chairmen in Plastic Surgery . In addition, Dr. Manson has been president of and is still actively involved in the A O Foundation, a voluntary international society of 12,000 surgeons dedicated to excellence in the surgical management of trauma and disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Dr. Manson has also been editor of or served on the editorial boards of the leading plastic surgery journals, including Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Annals of Plastic Surgery, and the Journal of Craniofacial Surgery. He currently is editor of the International Journal of Craniomaxillofacial Trauma & Reconstruction. At last count, Dr. Manson has authored more than 435 papers, 111 book chapters, and five books. For his innumerable contributions to his field, Dr. Manson has received dozens of prestigious honors and awards. In 2006, for instance, he received the Clinician of the Y ear Award from the AAPS, and in 2014 the AAPS gave him its inaugural Lifetime Achievement Clinical Research Award. Among his most treasured honors, however, is the inaugural Robert Goldwyn Mentor Award, which was presented by the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons in 2012 (the late Dr. Goldwyn, whom Dr. Manson knew well, was Chief of Plastic Surgery at Beth Israel Hospital from 1972 to 1996). Facial reconstruction T oday , Dr. Manson's busy clinical practice focuses largely on facial reconstruction of patients with significant facial skin cancers. \"From treating trauma patients, I learned a lot about how to treat patients with skin cancer,\" he says \u2014 knowledge that he used to develop and refine algorithms now used by countless other plastic surgeons. These days a typical patient of Dr. Manson's might need a nose reconstructed or a large amount of facial tissue replaced as a result of cancer. \"These people's lives are potentially devastated,\" he says. \"If I can achieve a good aesthetic result so my patients can go out in public and no one will know anything has been done, it gives me enormous satisfaction. Of all my roles, helping patients through their problems is my favorite. \" At this stage of his career, someone less dedicated than Dr. Manson might be thinking about what to do when he eventually retires. \"Everyone's on me now to get a hobby , but I'm hoping to defer that as long as possible,\" he quips, only half in jest. For now, Dr. Manson is happiest doing what he has always done: seeking innovative ways to continually improve the care of people whose faces have been disfigured by illness and injury . \" It's not the...technical details that stay with you from your residency training. It's the lessons about how to conduct your life.\" Paul Manson, MDFour years ago, 61-year-old Ralph Kinney , who lives in a tiny town in northeast Maine, was diagnosed with late-stage emphysema, a progressive lung disease. The condition left him tethered to an oxygen tank 24/7 , virtually housebound, subject to incapacitating coughing fits, and in and out of the local emergency department. Breathing was so difficult that his chest and arms were always sore. \"I had to struggle for each and every breath,\" he says. Mr. Kinney , a former heavy smoker, knew his situation was serious. But when his doctor told him in early 2012 that he had just three to six months to live, the husband and grandfather of eight was blindsided. \"I didn't want to die, and I was scared,\" he says. The unrelenting anxiety only made his symptoms worse. For a while, Mr. Kinney felt resigned to his fate. But not one to give up easily , he told his family , \"I'm going to beat this. \" He did an online search, found pulmonologist Joel Wirth, MD, at Maine Medical Center, and headed off to Portland. After providing optimal care that included new medications and pulmonary rehabilitation therapy , Dr. Wirth recommended that Mr. Kinney be evaluated at the BIDMC Chest Disease Center for a clinical trial of a new non-surgical treatment for patients with advanced emphysema. Dr. Wirth had learned about the study (the EMPROVE trial) during an invited presentation by interventional pulmonologist Adnan Majid, MD, director of the Chest Disease Center and a member of the department's Division of Thoracic Surgery and Interventional Pulmonology . The EMPROVE study is one of three FDA-approved multi-center clinical trials being offered at BIDMC for patients with advanced emphysema (see sidebar). \" After we evaluated Mr. Kinney , we determined that he was a good candidate for the EMPROVE trial,\" says Dr. Majid. The randomized trial, which is being conducted at 30 sites in the United States, is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of a device, the IBV Valve, that works by reducing the volume of the unhealthy area of the lungs. Dr. Majid explains that the lungs of emphysema patients become hyper-inflated in part because the alveoli \u2014 the tiny air sacs that exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide \u2014 have lost their elasticity and thus trap air. Hyper-inflated lungs lead to difficulty Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 6 bidmc.org/surgeryClinical Trials Offer Emphysema Patients New Hope \" T o be able to breathe again, to live my life, and have a future \u2014 it's truly a miracle.\" Ralph Kinney This tiny valve redirects air to healthier parts of the lung.BREATHING EASIERbidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 7with breathing in several ways: they prevent normal expansion of the healthy parts of the lungs, push down the diaphragm (breathing muscle), and increase intrathoracic pressure, leading to lower cardiac output. The IBV Valve is a small, umbrella-shaped, one-way valve made of nitinol and polyurethane that is deployed into selected airways of a lung via a bronchoscope inserted through the patient's mouth. The device is currently approved only for use in one lung. The valve, which expands and contracts with breathing, prevents air from entering the diseased areas of the lung but allows any trapped air and excretions to flow out. By redirecting air to healthier parts of the lung, the valves (more than one are placed) reduce hyper-inflation. The procedure is done under general anesthesia and the patient stays in the hospital overnight. Mr. Kinney underwent the hour-long procedure, during which nine valves were placed in his upper left lung lobe, in March 2014. \"I was thrilled to get into the treatment group,\" says Mr. Kinney , who was the first patient on the East coast to undergo the procedure (BIDMC has treated five patients thus far). \" After meeting Dr. Majid and his wonderful team [including Erik Folch, MD, Aisha Aloma, MD, MPH, and Meghan Fashjian, NP], I had complete trust in them. I figured this was my chance. \" The potential benefits of this treatment include a reduction in lung volume and improvements in pulmonary function, exercise capacity , and quality of life. Mr. Kinney experienced all four. Dr. Majid, who will follow Mr. Kinney for five years as part of the study protocol, says that in addition to a greatly improved quality of life, Mr. Kinney's lung function tests have improved significantly and his lung volume has been reduced. \"He is doing extremely well,\" says Dr. Majid, as are the other four patients in the trial. T oday , Mr. Kinney is a new man. He happily mows his three acres of property , cheers on his grandchildren at their soccer games, and even went hunting last fall with his eldest grandson. He uses oxygen only when sleeping at night. \"Life is good!\" he says. Most amazing, says Mr. Kinney , is that he doesn't even have to think about his breathing any more \u2014 it just happens, like it does for most people, while he's going about his life. \"I realize I'm not cured and I'll never run a marathon. But to be able to breathe again, to live my life, and have a future \u2014 it's truly a miracle. \" For more information about clinical trials and services for patients with emphysema and other lung diseases, please visit our website: bidmc.org/surgery>chest disease center.

The BIDMC Chest Disease Center is participating in two other trials of non-surgical lung-volume reduction options for patients with advanced emphysema: the LIBERATE study (which is evaluating another type of valve) and the RENEW study (which is evaluating coils). BIDMC is the only hospital in New England to participate in all three trials, offering eligible emphysema patients the widest array of non-surgical options. Ralph Kinney can once again enjoy time with his grandchildren.

An expert with broad experience in cochlear implantation in adults and children, Dr. Heman-Ackah founded the BIDMC Cochlear Implantation Program in 2014. Dr. Heman-Ackah conducts basic and clinical research focused primarily on the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. She is the principal investigator of a basic science investigation aimed at developing gene therapy for the treatment of genetic forms of congenital hearing loss, which is funded by a grant from the HMS Office for Diversity Inclusion and Community Partnership. Her clinical research includes a multi-institutional project evaluating noise exposure on long-term otologic health and outcomes research in complex cochlear implantation cases. Promotions and Appointments The Department of Surgery congratulates the following faculty members on their Harvard Medical School promotions and appointments.bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 9Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD, has been named the Lewis Thomas Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Ferran, a member of the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery , the Division of Nephrology , the Center for Vascular Biology Research, and the Transplant Institute at BIDMC, has been a Professor of Surgery at HMS since 2009. Dr. Ferran conducts basic research focusing largely on the many roles of the molecule A20 \u2014 in liver regeneration and repair as well as a wide range of conditions that include vascular diseases, diabetes, organ transplantation, cancer, and eye diseases. Her novel discoveries, several of which are being evaluated for clinical implementation, could lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with these conditions. Dr. Ferran's investigations of A20, which reach back more than 20 years to her seminal discovery of its potent anti-inflammatory function, triggered a dynamic field of scientific inquiry that has generated nearly 1,000 scholarly papers. She is the author of more than 110 publications and the recently published book, The Multiple Therapeutic Targets of A20. Dr. Ferran is also very active in training and mentoring the next generation of academic surgeons and scientists, and serves in a leadership role on many influential committees at BIDMC and HMS. Says Frank LoGerfo, MD, the former Chief of Vascular Surgery , \"This extraordinary scientist is also the most energetic, inspiring, and admired mentor of surgery residents in our NIH research training program. \" The Lewis Thomas Professorship was established in 1995 by Sandoz T echnology (now Novartis) to honor Lewis Thomas, MD (1913-1993). A graduate of the HMS class of 1937 , Dr. Thomas was an immunologist, educator, administrator, and champion of funding for basic research. He served as president and chief executive officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and also dean of the medical schools of New Y ork University and Y ale University . Dr. Thomas was perhaps best known as a gifted writer whose work includes The Lives of a Cell, for which he received a National Book Award. The first incumbent of the Lewis Thomas Professorship was Dr. Ferran's mentor, the late Fritz Bach, MD (1934-2011), a pioneer in transplant immunology and former Director of the Sandoz Center for Immunobiology in the BIDMC Division of Transplant Surgery . In 1998, Dr. Bach was awarded the Medawar Prize by the Transplantation Society , the highest award for outstanding contributions to the field of organ transplantation. \"The Lewis Thomas Professorship is an enormous honor of which Dr. Ferran is justly meritorious. Her studies of the biological functions of the A20 molecule collectively represent a quintessential example of important, high-impact basic science/translational medicine research that will have important clinical applications for years to come,\" says Anthony Monaco, MD, Director Emeritus of the BIDMC Transplant Institute. \"Dr. Ferran is the most deserving Harvard scientist to hold her former mentor's Lewis Thomas Professorship,\" notes Robert Fisher, MD, Chief of the Division of Transplant Surgery and Director of the BIDMC Transplant Institute. \"The translation of Dr. Ferran's basic science of A20 into clinical medicine, which is just around the corner, will be a transformative leap forward. \" Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD, Named Lewis Thomas Professor of Surgery \" The Lewis Thomas Professorship is an enormous honor of which Dr . Ferran is justly meritorious. Her studies...will have important clinical applications for years to come.\" Anthony Monaco, MD Dir ector Emeritus, BIDMC Transplant Institutebidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 10< Continued from page 9 Richard Cummings, PhD, was recently recruited to the Department of Surgery as Vice Chair of Basic and Translational Research. In addition, he serves as Chair of the Research Council of the Department of Surgery and as Associate Director of the department's Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research. Dr. Cummings came to BIDMC from Emory University School of Medicine, where he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry . Dr. Cummings is one of the country's leading biological chemists, with broad and deep expertise in a wide range of areas in the biomedical sciences. He is most recognized as an international leader in the field of glycobiology . This is a relatively new area that is rapidly gaining interest due to the recent explosion of information about the roles of glycans, or sugars, in all aspects of biology , health, and disease, which has led to the development of new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. Dr. Cummings is widely considered a leader in this field. He is Chair of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, a worldwide group of more than 500 principal investigators, as well as Director of the National Center for Functional Glycomics, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health. During its first year, this center has established collaborations with more than 100 investigators from across the United States and abroad. Dr. Cummings brings to BIDMC many technological tools that did not previously exist at Harvard or in Boston but are critical for the analysis of glycan structure and its biological function. His work impacts many areas relevant to surgery: cancer biology , innate and adaptive immunity , thrombosis and hemostasis, nutrition, and infectious diseases. In addition to being a superb investigator of fundamental biological and biomedical problems, Dr. Cummings has extensive translational research experience. He has developed new drugs and identified new diagnostic reagents and biomarkers, and founded two biotechnology companies. He was the co-founder and prior president and chief scientific officer of Selexys Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company with a pipeline of therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Selexys currently has a drug, SelG1, in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of sickle cell disease. HMS, through a formal process that included a review by the deans of Academic and Clinical Affairs, Faculty Affairs, and Graduate Studies, gave provisional approval for the formation of a Center for Glycosciences at HMS, which will be directed by Dr. Cummings with its core base of operations at BIDMC. The center will galvanize a diverse group of investigators from BIDMC and across all HMS-affiliated institutions in the field of glycoscience in areas as varied as surgery , transplantation, cardiovascular biology , pathology , immunology , infectious disease, cancer, and hematology . The center will also raise awareness in the research community of the far-reaching roles that glycomics play in health and disease, and drive the development of new diagnostic tools and therapies. In so doing, the center will establish BIDMC and HMS as leaders in the glycosciences and will coordinate efforts around the world to define the human glycome. \"We are so pleased to welcome Dr. Cummings, an individual of immense talent and integrity , to Boston,\" says Department of Surgery Chairman Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD. \"His presence will enrich our department and the greater BIDMC and Harvard communities. \" Richard Cummings, PhD, Joins Department as Vice Chair of Basic and Translational Research Noted scientist is an international leader in the field of glycobiology bidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 11Department Welcomes New Trainees In June, the Department of Surgery hosted the 2015-2016 new General Surgery interns and upper-level residents to the BIDMC community at a reception at the Harvard Club in Boston.

Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 18 bidmc.org/surgeryPrior to the early 1990s, patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that required surgical repair had to undergo a major operation involving a large incision, a long hospitalization and recovery period, pain, and the potential complications of open surgery . The subsequent advent and widespread adoption of endovascular AAA repair \u2014 a minimally invasive procedure during which the aneurysm is repaired via small incisions or tiny punctures in the groin \u2014 has meant that many patients can forgo most of the downsides of open surgery . T oday , more than 75 percent of patients nationwide undergo endovascular aneurysm repair (EV AR) for infrarenal AAAs. Thanks to advances in the design and delivery of the grafts used to repair aneurysms and the growing proficiency of vascular surgeons in minimally invasive approaches, endovascular aneurysm repairs of increasing complexity are now being performed by experienced surgeons at major medical centers like BIDMC. This not only makes surgery easier on patients; it also PICTURE PERFECT BIDMC Plays a Leading Role in Development of Innovative 3-D Roadmap T echnology Marc Schermerhorn, MD, has been collaborating for years with engineers in the Netherlands to develop and refine a novel image-fusion technology . Hilary Bennettbidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 19 bidmc.org/surgerymakes treatment an option for individuals who previously would not have been considered for open surgical repair because of advanced age or existing co-morbidities. Certainly no one recommends turning back the clock 25 years to when all AAA repairs were done with an open procedure. But open surgical aneurysm repair has one big advantage over EV AR \u2014 while in the operating room, the surgeon has a direct view of the patient's vasculature. Most surgeons performing EV AR today have to rely on a two-dimensional image created by fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray imaging) and a three-dimensional image created pre-operatively . During the procedure, the surgeon must mentally merge these two images to know precisely where he or she is working in the patient's anatomy . This is akin to having GPS in your car that shows just the major highways, alongside a detailed paper map, and having to continually compare them to navigate to your destination. For the past several years, Marc Schermerhorn, MD, Chief of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery , has been collaborating with engineers at Philips Healthcare in the Netherlands to develop and refine a far better option \u2014 a novel image-fusion technology called \"V esselNavigator. \" Currently , V esselNavigator is in use only at BIDMC and a few hospitals in Europe, where it became commercially available last spring. In the United States, it is awaiting FDA approval. V esselNavigator performs the mental gymnastics formerly required of the surgeon: It fuses 3-D vascular anatomical information from a pre-operative CTA (or MRA) with the intra-operative live X-ray image, thus creating a continuous 3-D roadmap to guide surgeons through the patient's vasculature during the entire procedure. The 3-D roadmap can be rotated at any angle and follows the movement of the X-ray beam and the table on which the patient lies. This gives surgeons unique views of the anatomy in real time so they can precisely execute even the most complex aneurysm repairs. Dr. Schermerhorn and his colleagues conducted a study at BIDMC, which will be published in an upcoming edition of the Journal of V ascular Surgery*, that compared 16 patients who underwent EV AR for infrarenal AAA with V esselNavigator bidmc.org/surgeryContinued on page 20 >\" This technology offers so many advantages that I consider it indispensable and use it on all aortic inter ventions now.\" Marc Schermerhorn, MD Vascular fellow Lars Stangenberg, MD, PhD, begins the process for image fusion. Hilary Bennettwith 16 patients who underwent the same procedure with conventional imaging. Their study showed for the first time that, compared to conventional imaging, V esselNavigator offered four important benefits: It significantly reduced radiation dose for patients and providers, reduced fluoroscopy time, minimized the dose of contrast dye (which can cause serious side effects), and shortened procedure time. These benefits are particularly important as growing numbers of patients with more complex conditions that require lengthier procedures are deemed eligible for treatment. \"This technology offers so many advantages that I consider it indispensable and use it on all aortic interventions now,\" says Dr. Schermerhorn. The system was designed to be intuitive and is relatively easy to master, he adds. While V esselNavigator has proven in early studies to be beneficial for straightforward AAA repairs, Dr. Schermerhorn says that its greatest value will likely be in the treatment of more complex interventions. These include procedures such as aneurysm repair in locations that require fenestrated or branched grafts, repair of thoracic aneurysms and dissections, repair of complex endoleaks, and carotid artery stenting, all of which are now being performed at BIDMC using V esselNavigator. As this innovative new technology is put into use around the world, Dr. Schermerhorn looks forward to conducting multi-center research studies to evaluate V esselNavigator in higher complexity procedures and to helping train other vascular surgeons in its use. He also continues to collaborate with Philips Healthcare to develop other new technologies aimed at making vascular interventions better and safer for patients worldwide.

Assuming it was nothing serious, Mrs. Monaco was surprised but not particularly worried when an X-ray taken to screen for pneumonia showed a suspicious mass on her right lung. But surprise turned quickly to disbelief when a CT scan and subsequent PET scan done several days later brought bad news: she had lung cancer. \"I've always been very healthy and I've never smoked,\" says Mrs. Monaco, who is married and has three adult children. \"The diagnosis was a complete shock. \" Mrs. Monaco was referred to thoracic surgeon Sidhu Gangadharan, MD, Chief of the Division of Thoracic Surgery and Interventional Pulmonology . Dr. Gangadharan explained to Mrs. Monaco that she had early (stage 1) lung cancer and that treatment would require the removal of the lower lobe of her right lung (a lobectomy). \"Dr. Gangadharan was so reassuring, I knew I was in very good hands,\" says Mrs. Monaco. Fortunately Mrs. Monaco was a candidate for a video-assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) lobectomy . This is a minimally invasive approach that requires just four small incisions \u2014 the largest about 1.5 inches \u2014 compared to a six- to seven-inch incision with the open surgical approach. In addition to a shorter hospitalization, patients undergoing V ATS lobectomy experience less pain, fewer complications, and a faster return to normal activities, and have the same outcomes as those undergoing open procedures. Dr. Gangadharan and fellow thoracic surgeon Michael Kent, MD, are nationally recognized experts in V ATS lobectomy . Nationwide, only about 25 to 40 percent of lobectomies are performed minimally invasively . At BIDMC, 80 to 90 percent of lobectomies are done this way , making it one of the most experienced centers for this procedure in the nation. Mrs. Monaco underwent her surgery in early April 2014. She was out of the hospital in three days and in just three weeks was en route to Belgium with her husband, who works as a business consultant there. Even before her operation, Mrs. Monaco felt a need to do something to take control of her situation and, at the same time, express her gratitude to her caregivers. So she sent an e-mail to her family and friends asking them to donate to the Thoracic Surgery Education, Research, and Program Development Fund rather than send flowers and fruit arrangements. \" After all, there is only so much fruit you can Marissa Monaco at the finish line of the 2015 Boston Marathon. She joined \"Team BIDMC\" to show support for her mother and raise funds for BIDMC. Linda Monaco was treated for early-stage lung cancer with a minimally invasive treatment called VATS lobectomy. Hilary Bennettbidmc.org/surgery Inside Surgery | Fall/Winter 2015 \u2014 Page 27eat!\" she jokes. The fund helps support initiatives such as the annual lung cancer symposium, a patient-education program led by Dr. Gangadharan. At last count, Mrs. Monaco's appeal has generated more than $1,500 in donations to the fund. On top of that, her daughter, Marissa, participated in the 2015 \"T eam BIDMC\" Boston Marathon team to show support for her mother. Marissa, who lives in Seattle, has raised more than $12,500 for the BIDMC Cancer Center, bringing the family's total donations to BIDMC to $14,000. Mrs. Monaco notes proudly that her daughter was the third-leading fundraiser for the 2015 BIDMC team. Mrs. Monaco undergoes regular screenings and has no evidence of cancer. She feels terrific and hardly notices the effects of losing a lobe of a lung, walking many miles each week and traveling abroad frequently . \"I received exceptional care by an exceptional doctor in one of the best hospitals in the world,\" she says. \"My family and I are so grateful, and hope that the funds we helped raise will make a difference. \" \" I received exceptional care by an exceptional doctor in one of the best hospitals in the world.

PERMIT NO. 55356 < Continued from page 3 \"Our partnership is taking a true precision- medicine approach to understanding and treating pancreatic cancer,\" says Niven Narain, PhD, a co-founder, president, and chief technology officer of Berg. The company will employ its powerful artificial intelligence-based Interrogative Biology platform to discover biomarkers that detect this silent disease earlier. The biomarkers would also be used to tailor drug treatment based on the patient's responses (so-called theranostic markers, which identify patients who would benefit from a particular therapy), rather than the current approach, which Dr. Moser describes as \"trial and error. \" T ogether, the BIDMC Pancreatic Cancer Center and PCRT will design clinical trials and provide both healthy and treated pancreatic tissue, bio-fluids, and treatment results from patients for analysis using Berg's platform, which can generate an abundance of data points per sample. CRAB will provide guidance and infrastructure to coordinate the samples and clinical data needed to discover and validate the biomarkers. In addition, Berg's lead cancer drug, BPM 31510, will be introduced in phase 2 clinical trials for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer at PCRT sites around the world, including BIDMC. One of the first cancer drugs to be guided by artificial intelligence, BPM 31510 works by reprogramming the metabolism of cancer cells and, in the process, promotes cell death. The BIDMC Pancreatic Cancer Center is a high-volume, internationally renowned program that provides multidisciplinary, state-of-the-art care to patients with complex pancreatic cancers and rare pancreatic conditions.
