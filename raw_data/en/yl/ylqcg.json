Art therapy is a mental health profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active art-making, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship. . Art therapy, facilitated by a professional art therapist, effectively supports personal and relational treatment goals as well as community concerns. Art therapy is used to improve cognitive and sensorimotor functions, foster self-esteem and self-awareness, cultivate emotional resilience, promote insight, enhance social skills, reduce and resolve conflicts and distress, and advance societal and ecological change. WHO ARE ART THERAPISTS Art therapists are clinicians with master's-level or higher degrees trained in art and therapy that serve diverse communities in different settings\u2014from medical institutions and wellness centers, to schools and independent practices. Guided by ethical standards and scope of practice, their education and supervised training prepares them for culturally proficient work with diverse populations in a variety of settings. They are credentialed mental health care professionals who care deeply about the communities they support, helping to advance people's mental, emotional, and physical well-being. WHERE ART THERAPISTS WORK - Hospitals - Schools - Veteran's clinics - Private practice - Psychiatric and rehabilitation facilities - Community clinics - Crisis centers - Forensic institutions - Senior communities HOW ART THERAPY WORKS INACCURATE USE OF TERM 'ART THERAPY' Additional inquiries can be directed to the AATA at info@arttherapy.org. EXAMPLE ACTIVITIES IN ADVERTISING On occasion, non-art therapist practitioners might be found to advertise their services as \"art therapy.\" This is an inaccurate use of the term, as art therapy can only be practiced by an individual who possesses the required training, certification, and/or state licensure. Bona fide art therapy is beyond the scope of practice of non-art therapists. IN WORKSHOPS Another context in which art therapy may be inaccurately categorized includes professional trainings that furnish a certificate upon completion, which may mislead the participant to believe that he or she can practice art therapy. These sorts of trainings, workshops, and the like, give attendees the erroneous impression that art therapy is a modality rather than a profession. To prevent this problem, facilitators are advised to adhere to the AATA's Ethical Principles: \"When providing training and/or supervision to non-art therapists, art therapists take precautions to ensure that trainees understand the nature, objectives, expectations, limitations, and resulting qualifications of the supervision and/or training as distinct from formal studies in art therapy\" (8.6). As such, a disclaimer should be used to alert attendees accordingly. EXAMPLE PRODUCTS Several products on the market may inaccurately identify the term \"art therapy.\" Two such examples include art therapy apps and art therapy coloring books. IN ADULT COLORING BOOKS While the AATA does not discourage the use of coloring books for recreation and self-care, coloring activities must be distinguished from art therapy services provided by a credentialed art therapist.
