Will be coming back soon. Alok Verma 2023-02-02 The staff at this clinic are very professional and the clinic is wonderful! Bhabani Sankar 2023-02-01 I Visited Adyant Ayurveda for my gastric issues. I have had acid reflux, IBS and related symptoms for quite some time now. The symptoms have been especially severed for the last year . I had consulted a few doctors earlier and done two courses (for over a month) Each time I got relief from the symptoms but they were back soon after the course ended. When I consulted Dr.Shree Lakshmi she did a thorough analysis of the cause of the symptoms and she took the time to explain it to me in great detail. Since I have been taking her medicine I have been symptom free and feel like my digestive health has improved tremendously. I am recommending Adyant Ayurveda for their proper diagnosis and treatment . Most important its cost effective. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Vishal A 2023-01-26 Good Srinidhi Venkat 2023-01-26 Such experience.
