To this end, the Commission has set up a multi disciplinary and independent Expert Panel which provides advice on effective ways of investing in health (Commission Decision 2012/C 198/06 ). The core element of the Expert Panel 's mission is to provide the Commission with sound and independent advice in the form of opinions in response to questions (mandates) submitted by the Commission on matters related to health care modernisation, responsiveness, and sustainability. The advice does not bind the Commission. The areas of competence of the Ex pert Panel include, and are not limited to, primary care, hospital care, pharmaceuticals, research and development, prevention and promotion, links with the social protection sector, cross -border issues, system financing, information systems and patient re gister s, health inequalities, etc. Expert Panel members De Maeseneer Jan (Chair), De Oliveira & Food Safety Directorate B: Health Systems , medical products and innovation Unit B1 - Performance of national health systems Office: B232 B-1049 Brussels SANTE -EXPERT -PANEL@ec.europa.eu The opinions of the Expert Panel present the views of the independent scientists who a re members of the Expert Panel.

Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 4 ABSTRACT Essential workers, including the health workforce, were under increased stress and mental health risks in addition to infection risk during the COVID -19 pandemic. Aggravated levels of psychological distress ought to be recognised as a public health priorit y, and solutions are needed to address the consequences so that the potential current mental health conditions do not become disabilities . Therefore, the Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health (EXPH) was requested by the European Commission to provide an opinion on supporting the mental health of the health workforce and of other essential workers. The Opinion identifies the specific factors influencing the mental health of the health workforce and of other essential workers . It describes the evidence on effective and/or promising interventions, and provides evidence on cost-effectiveness , where available . Due consideration was given to providing for the needs of those with pre -existing mental health issues . The characteristics o f those interventions are described, elaborating on the necessary preconditions to ensure the efficient delivery of these interventions in a n effective, cost-effective, affordable and inclusive manner , across settings and jurisdictions . On the basis of this evidence, recommendations and action points were developed , emphasis ing the importance of involving both EU and national policy makers alike, raising awareness and engaging senior managers in sectors with a high share of essential workers , and, potentiat ing the role of mental health and occupational health practitioners in supporting the mental health of workers . Mental health, defined as lack of mental illness and high levels of mental wellbeing, is influenced by a co mplex interplay of determinants. A t work, occupation -specific determinants of me ntal health interact with non-occupational -specific characteristics. A conceptual framework was developed to represent the state of mental health, determinants / factors, and possible mental health trajectories over time in the face of a given stressor . The conceptual framework illustrates the potential impact of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention interventions occurring at different levels . These include : the health and social/community care sectors, work place-level interventions (such as occupational health program mes and managerial -level changes), and economic/social policy measures. Mental health of essential workers can therefore be supported by interventions enacted within and outside of the health se ctor at primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels. Interventions in multiple settings at various levels can work synergistically to address a wide range of risk factors and potentiate a wide range of protective factors. T he Swiss cheese model of accident causation is a helpful heuristic to illustrate this synergy. This model demonstrates the need for multiple interventions targeting multiple risk and protective factors occurring at multiple levels to ensure that all individuals benefit from them a nd no one individual is left behind. It suggests the priorities of different levels of interventions, from large scale interventions supporting the largest share of essential workers, to the interventions targeting organisational and team characteristics, job characteristics and lastly targeting modifiable individual characteristics. Specifically, post -traumatic stress disorder, burnout and moral injury are associated with working in stressful conditions, and could be anticipated and prevented in the workpl ace, or addressed when present. Based on available evidence and identified limitations, gaps and challenges, eight recommendations with several action points are developed: change focus to mental wellbeing; treat mental wellbeing as an inherent part of the workplace and its organisation ; create a supportive environment a t EU-level; create an appropriate cost - effectiveness methodology ; build and share knowledge on inter ventions; have a common EU -wide view of mental health care; prepare organisations and their leaders to address mental wellbeing of workers ; and provide timely and adequate access to care when preventive efforts are not effective .

Multiple contribut ing factors such as anxiety (including , risk of infection) and exceptionally high workload , often led to burnout. This increased burden of psychological distress ought to be recognised as a public health priority . Interventions to immediately support the mental health and alleviate the consequences of stress, fear, and moral injury are urgently required . These actions are needed to adequately address the major threat to the lon g-term mental health of large numbers of essential workers and to the sustainability of the health workforce and of health systems. Enhanced emotional and social support is critical to protect from long -term disability , particularly given the sustained eff ect of system pressure on people and health systems due to COVID -19. In this Opinion , we identif y factors influencing the mental health of the health workforce and of other essential workers and examine effectiveness and, where available, cost - effectiveness of promising interventions . We set out the characteristics of interventions that could be effective, including for people who have pre-existing mental health conditions and we discuss their cost-effectiveness , affordab ility, and inclusi ve delivery. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mental health a s \"a state of mental wellbeing in which people cope well with the many stresses of life, can realize their own potential, can function productively and fruitfully, and are able to contribute to their communities\" . Optimal mental health involves the absence of mental illness and a high level of mental wellbeing. E xisting r esearch has focuse d more on the mental illness rather than on the mental wellbeing. Our understanding on mental illn ess and mental health lags far behind our understanding of physical health , particularly given the lack of definitive biological markers and diagnostic challenges . Mental illness is often associated with s tigma , a critical barrier in itself determining health-seeking behaviour and, ultimately, access to care. Mental health is influenced by risk and protective factors both within and around the individual. Furthermore, the c omplex interplay of determinants, both occupation -specific and generic, necessitates a comprehensive framework with an array of intervention s, across sectors, settings and levels . These should act synergistically to tackle the wide and diverse range of risk factors whilst enhancing the effect of protective factors , ensuring no one is left behind . We propose a conceptual framework to represent this complexity, including possible mental health trajectories in response to stress over time. The conceptual framework includes primary, secondary and tertiary prevention across levels: the role of health and social/community care sectors, workplace interventions (such as occupational health program mes and manage ment policies ), and economic/social policy measures. We note Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 8 that there are still many evidence gaps to inform comprehensive policies. Surveys often lack methodological robustness, i.e., inadequate sample size, limited representativeness and generalisability . Currently, most available research on mental health , both before pandemic and during the pandemic, does not adequately address functional aspects of mental health or of mental wellbeing. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), burnout and moral injury can be anticipated. Prevention must be the first priority, and appropriate treatment used should preventive measures fail. We desc ribe factors that increase or decrease the risk of adverse mental health outcomes in the healthcare workers at individual, organisation and societal levels. Safeguarding access to mental health services during the pandemic is an urgent need . The need for f urther research should also be recognised and prioritised to help understand longer -term mental health impacts. Effective interventions to protect mental health of essential workers are likely to be complex and multi -faceted, addressing modifiable risk fac tors to be implemented across multiple levels. In the context of the Opinion development, evidence from multiple sources, encompassing best practices, guidelines, toolkits, among others, was reviewed . This allowed for the identification of c oordinated in tegrated approaches to support mental health of essential workers . Despite the lack of robust evidence on the effectiveness of interventions designed to address the mental health needs of workers with or without pre-existing mental health conditions, train ing healthcare workers in resilience may be particularly effective for those with a history of mental ill -health . A wide range of mental health support services that can meet the diverse needs of groups with different vulnerabilities and risks should also be made available. Due to potential stigma and discrimination, efforts in the workplace to support mental health should be accompanied by due consideration of legal and ethical responsibilities. The excess burden of mental health issues in the health workf orce is well-described, however assessing cost- effectiveness of interventions to address them remains complex given the challenges in quantifying the impacts to assess (economic, societal, ethical, etc.). Organisational delivery conditions are conceptualiz ed in this Opinion using an implementation science framework , which posits that t he success of implementation depends on how its delivery is organised and is context dependent . Contextual factors such workplace culture and leadership can largely influence implementation outcomes , whereas resource constraints and barriers, as well as facilitators are also examined. Specifically, we identified several core conditions for the delivery of mental health services . With respect to the intervention, meeting and ada pting to evolving user needs is important, as well as assessing the role of stigma, whilst ensuring those with a history of mental health and/or pre -disposing factors are not targeted . Many delivery conditions focused on the workplace and included ensur ing safe space and processes (e.g. for help -Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 9 seeking ) and fostering an environment of trust . For example, it is important to train occupational health practitioners and managers in mental health assessment and key delivery conditions while emphasising that there should be no adverse consequences for help-seeking behaviour . These and other delivery conditions set the stage to driv e transformation in organisational culture towards one of acceptance of the continuum of mental health issues . To support workplace interventions , a clear and comprehensive regulatory and financial structure and mechanisms of support are required. Attention to public and private sector organisations , including multinational corporations (MCNs) and small- and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs ) is needed. These enabling structures should encompass sustainable support for long -term prevention and treatment programs, and research and development of innovative approaches , such as de- stigmatization, care re -organization, regulatory frameworks, and data collection and harmonization initiatives. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) stipulates that general occupational safety and health risk assessment in the workplace is a legal obligation of all employers in the EU . Throug h its guidelines, EU -OSHA reaffirms th at these stipulations a re equally applicable with regards to the mental health of workers . EU- OSHA recommends participatory psychosocial risk assessment be included as part of the occupational safety and health require ment, and used to identify risks and to inform intervention design . Further, EU -OSHA recognizes that s ome mental health problems may be caused or aggravated by poor psychosocial work environment , incl uding , excessive time pressure, conflict, violence, harassment, lack of support, and/or lack of appreciation . Those factors should be identified and addresse d in both preventive and remedial means, and in a complementary manner . Protection of workers ' mental health is an integral part of occupational safety and health. The Opinion concludes with eight evidence -based recommendations, complemented by action points with EU -wide and Member -State relevance. The recommendations are addressed to policy makers and managers in sectors with a high share of essential workers , as well as to mental health and occupational health practitioners . The focus of these recommendations is on fostering the mental wellbeing of the health workforce and other essential workers and the need to treat mental wellbeing as a n organisation al responsibility within the workplace . The recommendations address the roles of stakeholders at several levels ( organi sations , national authorities and EU). The action points detail the general principle described in each recommendation. Specifically, t here is the need for appropriate guidance frameworks to be established, in some cases deserving legal status, to clearly establish mental wellbeing as a n important workplace responsibility within organisations. This requires awareness and competencies by the leadership of organisations, which can be facilitated via education and training. To Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 10 support promotion of mental wellbeing in SMEs, the use of common digital tools (yet to be developed ) can be advantageous. In addition, workplaces must develop a dequate mechanisms for early identification of factors influencing mental wellbeing and for referral to professional help when preventive efforts are not effective. T he organisation, as opposed to the individual worker, is to be held publically accountable for worker wellbeing . Building and sharing knowledge on interventions that work via the creation of learning communities is recommended. The identification of best practices that are cost - effective require further evidence, which should be developed by overcom ing methodological challenges . Lastly, a common EU-wide view of mental health care and its re-organi sation is needed with emphasis on prevention and support of mental wellbeing in not only essential workers, but the general population as a whole. BACKGROUN D Essential workers, whether in the health or other sectors, have been hit hard by the consequences of the COVID -19 pandemic. This is not just due to the risk of infection arising from close contact with patients, the general public , and potentially infectious co - workers . Although less well recognised, they have also faced risks to their mental health.1 The list of those at risk is long. Th ey include healthcare personnel, long term care workers, teachers, cleaners, cooks, emergency personnel (police, fire department, civil protection), people working in transport, agriculture and food production, critical retail facilities (grocery stores, h ardware stores), critical trades (construction workers, electricians, plumbers etc.), water and wastewater workers , energy and distribution , those delivering social service s, and others that manage critical infrastructure and services. When the Covid -19 pandemic hit, many essential workers had no choice but to continue working physically at their workplace to provide services for others at great risk to their own health and that of their families. We now know that many were exposed to a high risk of COVID -19. 2 If infected, some were also at greater risk of becoming ill or transmitting the infection to others. Th ey include d elderly workers, people from low - income households, workers with underlying health conditions (e.g. chronic illness), those with existing mental health issues, workers in temporary or informal employment, and refugees and some migrant s. A Health at a Glance: Europe 2020 report points to several factors that adversely affected the mental health of health workers: lack of personal protective equipment, their exceptionally high workload , and the psychological pressure faced by health professionals.3 An Ital ian survey of health care , in March 2020, reported frequent Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 11 symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia, especially amongst frontline workers and young women.4 In April 2020 a Spanish survey reported that 57% of health workers had with symptoms of post -traumatic stress disorder.5 In response to this evidence , support services for health workers in many countries were expanded to help them deal with the high level of stress, fatigue and psychological distress during these extremely challenging times, for example through peer support groups or dedicated phone support lines. Yet despite the growing number of studies on the mental health consequences of the pandemic on health care workers, there is much less on the situation faced by essential workers in other sectors , althou gh the European Commission did set up a virtual network of (not -for-profit) stakeholder organizations on its Health Policy Platform to discuss and share knowledge and practices on COVID19 - related mental health issues . This includes guidance to help address the mental health aspects of the COVID19 -pandemic. There have also been initiatives to provid e psychological support to the general population, for example through online advice or phone hotlines . However less is known about what employers have been doing to support their employees , especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions and how, if at all, these link to health services, and especially primary care . The Expert Panel on E ffective ways of I nvesting in H ealth (EXPH) highlighted in a previous opinion that measures to tackle psychological distress should be recognised as a public health priority. 6 Comprehensive strategies , rapidly implemented, with clear lines of accountability were needed to reduce the adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic but were largely lacking. Now, as there is beginning to be some reason for optimism, it will be essential to put in place measures that can minimise the threats to the mental health of essential workers going forward and ensure that those already affected can recover without long term disability. This means that we need innovative solutions , combining societal, organisational, team and individ ual responses, with engagement by all those who can provide the necessary psychosocial support. The primary target audience of this opinion comprises those responsible for policy and health, employment, and recovery from the pandemic at national and EU lev el, as well as senior managers in sectors with high shares of essential workers. It should also be of interest to mental health and occupational health practitioners. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 12 QUESTIONS FOR THE EXPERT PANEL 1.) What are the specific factors influencing mental health of the health workforce and essential workers? 2.) What interventions could be effective in addressing mental health support needs of health workers and essential workers, including those with preexistin g mental health conditions? Using existing data, assess the cost of mental health problems in the health workforce and the cost -effectiveness of mental health interventions. What are the conditions for the delivery of these interventions in a cost -effectiv e, affordable and inclusive manner? 3.) How can the EU address these concerns? Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 13 1. OPINION 1.1. What are the specific factors influencing mental health of the health workforce and of \"other essential workers\"? General overview of mental health Mental health can be envisaged as a two -dimensional concept (Figure 1). On one dimension lies a continuum , that could be described as pathogenic or illness focused, from no mental illness to serious mental illness. On another, and arguably , a more important dimension is salutogenic ,7 or health focused, comprising a spectrum of ability to function. This salutogenic approach is aligned with t he World Health Organization 's definition of mental health as \"a state of mental wellbeing in which people cope well with the many stresses of life, can realize their own potential, can function productively and fruitfully, and are able to contribute to their communities .\"8 Some authors refer to this as the continuum between flourishing/ thriving and languishing/surviving.9,10 In Figure 1, optimal mental health is present at the area with high mental wellbeing and lack of mental illness. The \"whole health approach\" to supporting the mental health of essential workers requires addressing both mental illness servi ces and mental health promotion and protection. Figure 1. The two dimensions of mental health Less than optimal mental health occurs when a person s hows signs or symptoms of mental illness and/or low mental wellbeing affecting their everyda y function. If this is well managed, he/she may be able to restore his/her mental health to optimal levels . However, if not effectively managed, they may lead to sub -optimal mental health leaving the individual concerned unable to function day-to-day. Serious Mental Illness No Mental IllnessFlourishing / Thriving Languishing / SurvivingOPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH: High mental well -being & lack of mental illnessHigh mental well -being & mental illness Low mental well -being & mental illnessLow mental well -being & lack of mental illnessSupporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 14 The signs and symptoms of mental health are many and complex. C ommon mental illnesses include depression (sadness and loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, possible suicidal ideation), anxiety disorders (excessive, debilitating worrying), and post -traumatic stress disorder (long- term symptoms in respons e to a traumatic event, including re -experiencing the event via nightmares and/or intrusive memories). At the risk of generalisation, r esearch tends to focus more on the mental illness dimension of mental health than the mental wellbeing dimension. Yet, mental wellbeing has received considerable attention in the media, which has been especially focussed on the psychological and emotional impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic .11-13 Our understanding of mental illness and mental health often lags far behind our understanding of physical health. Identifying and treating mental health disorders is more complex than treating bodily illness or injury. Many m ental illnesses lack definitive biological markers and signs/ symptoms can be interpreted in different ways . Mental illness symptoms may manifest as cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and/or physical (or bodily/somatic) phenomena . This makes it challenging to rule out alternative diagnoses although there are now many assessment tools, typically based on questionnaires, designed to use with mental wellb eing and mental health/illness. As with a physical illness, diagnosis depends on someone seeking help and overcoming the many barriers that exist in doing so. However, there are additional problems when someone has mental health problems because they may not recognise them or they may fear the s tigma that is often associated with them .14 Conceptual Frame work The mandate asks how the EU can support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers. To do so, it is first necessary to have a framework to understand mental health and its causes. These causes involve a complex interplay of biological, environmental, cultural, economic, health system, social, occupational, familial, psychological, and individual factors. Risk factors increase vulnerability to experiencing adverse mental health , whereas protective factors do the opposite. The y can assist recovery after exposure to stress (harm -reduction approach), protect against adverse mental health prior to stress (protection approach), and/or promote positive aspects of mental health (promotion approach). 15 A life-course approach highlights the importance of prior and current experienc es.16 Thus, t he mental health of a person at a given point is influenced by a combination of prior and current experiences , risk factors, and protective factors . In the present context, occupation -specific factors influencing mental health have become especially apparent during the COVID -19 pandemic and are of particular importance. This calls for an emphasis on the workplace. To help us, we have developed a conceptual framework that provides a visual representation of the factors that we must consider to effectively Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 15 and efficiently support the mental health of essential workers. The framework includes interventions to provide primary, secondary and tertiary prevention a cross sectors, settings and levels . The most relevant are the health and social/community care sectors ; the workplace (such as occupational health program mes and managerial -level changes), and within the wider economic and social policy arena ( Figure 2). Figure 2. Conceptual framework for supporting the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers Source: The authors The focus of Figure 2 is the individual's mental health profile at a given point in time, represented by the two- dimensional grid of mental illness and mental wellbeing presented earlier. Risk and protective factors interact to influence this profile . Given the focus of this Opinion, we consider non-occupation -specific (e.g., biological, social- environmental, and psychological ), which then interact with occupation- specific factors such as characteristics of jobs, teams, and organizations, all within a broader health and social care and policy conte xt. These individually and collectively influence the mental health trajectory of the individual concerned. We can illustrate this by looking at a hypothetical chain of events. W e begin at the box labelled \"Mental Health Profile\". One or more stressors occurs (for instance related to the COVID -19 pandemic ). Whether this leads to a deterioration in the individuals mental health depends on how the individual responds . If they effectively cope with the stressor(s) , then he/she is likely to maintain his/her cur rent level of mental health. This is the top trajectory in Figure 2. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 16 However, the ability to cope can change over time. We can expect a worsening of mental health i f (i) the stressor is very traumatic and/or prolonged over time and/or there is an accumulation of multiple stressors and (ii) the person is especially susceptible to the stressor(s) at that time due to the complex interplay of factors that determine mental health and individual thresholds . The extent of deterioration will depend on t he initial mental health profile and the interac tion of occupation -and non -occupation -specific risk and protective factors. This is represented by trajectories 1 and 2 , with trajectory 1 involving less severe deterioration than trajectory 2. In each case , recovery may occur spontaneously, depending on the initial mental health profile and the combination of risk and protective factors . There may be a variety of interventions that can influence modifiable risk /protective factors and /or mitigate the effects of the stressor (primary prevention), while others might mitigate the impact of the stressor on mental health and/or promote rapid recovery from the stressor (secondary prevention), and/or decrease the rate of deteriorating mental health (tertiary prevention) . In each of these trajectories, there are two further pathways, a and b. In scenario 2a , the mental health of the individual continuously deteriorate s over time without effective secondary prevention but remain stable at a low level with effective tertiary prevention. S cenario 1a, compared to scenario 2a, illustrates how secondary prevention reduces the extent of mental health deterioration caused by the stressor. In both b scenarios, mental health eventually recovers , return ing to baseline in scena rio 1b but not in scenario 2b . Thus, besides influencing the initial level of deterioration caused by the stressor, secondary prevention can prompt a faster recovery , an earlier recovery, and/or a more complete recovery and return to baseline mental health . Figure 2 includes a simplified Venn diagram to show three non-occupation -specific factor groupings - biological factors, social and environmental factors, and psychological factors. Vulnerabilities might include genetic predisposition to mental illness , lack of social or familial support, economic difficulties, and/or psychological traits such as strategies to cope with stress or cognitive tendencies like optimism vs. pessimism. Given the mandate's focus on essential workers during the COVID -19 pandemic, occupation -specific determinants of mental health interact with these non-occupational - specific characteristics. T hree different occupation al groups are likely to respond different ly to a stressor such as those arising in the COVID -19 pandemic. Health workers may be under severe pressure from increased workload, in addition to being concerned about contracting the virus and suffering from moral injury . Other essential workers, such as those in the food or transport industry , may also be concerned about the possibility of contracting the virus, may be less exposed, and may instead experience increased pressure from working long hours . Non-essential workers may also experience Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 17 their own pressures working from home for a prolonged time , managing simul taneous stressors such as isola tion and lack of social contact, and/or financial consequences of being furloughed. Evidence on risk and protective factors for essential workers will be examined in detail in C hapter 2. Finally, mental health can be suppor ted by interventions enacted within and outside of the health sector at primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels. This is especially relevant for essential workers. For example, an employer can design and implement internal policies to increase support to employees under stress or help to organise access to care outside the organis ation if needed and wanted . There is also scope for primary preventative interventions, e.g. by employers who allow employees a certain degree of control over their wor kload or work tasks , or government interventions to ensure a minimum income level or to develop healthy lifestyles. Available evidence regarding promising and effective interventions to support the mental health of essential workers will be explored in Cha pter 3, and cost -effective interventions will be described in the Chapter 4. Delivery conditions for the implementation of interventions to support the mental health of essential workers is covered in Chapter 5. Interventions in multiple settings at variou s levels can work synergistically to address a wide range of risk factors and potentiate a wide range of protective factors. Although the relationship between exposure and outcome in mental health is complex and often far from straightforward, the Swiss ch eese model 17 of accident causation used in risk analysis and risk managem ent is a helpful heuristic to illustrate this synergy. See Figure 3. Figure 3. The Swiss Cheese model for supporting mental health in essential workers Source: Reason's Swiss cheese model combining person and systems approaches to human fallibility , 18 adapted by the authors The Swiss Cheese model assumes optimal levels of mental health at the start and provides a visual representation of how to prevent further mental health deterioration by Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 18 blocking \"holes\" at different stages. I t does not provide a complete roadmap to achieving optimal mental health , but it is a particularly valuable heuristic for supporting the mental health of essential workers for four main reason s. First, its use in safety and occupational health means that there is already some familiarity with the model by those who need to use it. Second, it places responsibility for mental health on both the individual and the system. The person approach focuses on individual- level interventions, whereas a systems approach concentrates on the interactions among the individual, his/her employment conditions , and the regulatory/policy environment . Each slice of the cheese represents interventions at different levels that contribute to mental health of employees. For instance, i t illustrates attempts by workplace leadership to build safeguards, barriers, and defences to prevent deterioration in mental health. Third, it recognizes that any safeguard or interventi on will have inherent flaws or \"holes\". The \"holes\" in this example are unaddressed risk and/or protective factors. Mental health deterioration will occur when multiple \"holes\" line up , leaving workers exposed . When \"holes\" are blocked by multiple interven tions at multiple levels, the trajectory towards low mental health is deterred. This demonstrates the need for multiple interventions targeting multiple risk and protective factors occurring across levels to ensure that all individuals benefit equally from them, incl uding the most vulnerable, and no one individual is left behind. Lastly, the Swiss Cheese model illustrates the priority given to different levels of interventions. The first slices of the cheese are large- scale, broad economic and social policy interventions designed to support the largest numbers of essential workers. For those individuals who need additional support , the next level targets the workplace organizational and team characteristics. For those who need additional support, there are i nterventions to address specific job characteristics. The last level introduces individual- level interventions, which can be expected to be effective as along as interventions on other levels are in place. 1.2. Specific factors influencing mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers Exposure of e ssential workers to SARS -CoV-2 Supporting the mental health of the work ers has been an important priority of the World Health Organization (WHO) for many years. 19 This has become especially salient as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Particular emphasis has been placed on the \"essential\" worker, who was required to continue working on-site during the most severe periods , while, i n order to contain the virus, millions of \"non-essential\" workers were confined to their homes, either unable to work or tele -working . Each Member State determined their own lists of \"essential workers\" , enc ompassing individuals who perform a range of services and operations in industries that are necessary to ensure the continuity of Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 19 critical functions of a country and maintain critical infrastructure. As defined in the mandate, essential workers include the health and care workforce, teachers, cleaners, cooks, emergency personnel (police, fire department, civil protection), people working in transport, agriculture and food production, critical retail (grocery stores, hardware stores), critical trades (constr uction workers, electricians, plumbers , etc.), water and wastewater management, energy production and distribution, social service organisation and other sectors that manage critical infrastructure and services. Some types of gig economy workers were also considered essential. These essential workers continued their jobs on the frontline throughout the COVID -19 pandemic , facing potential risks to their own health and the health of their loved ones as a result of higher exposure risk to SARS- CoV-2. Compared to non -essential workers, essential workers did experience a higher risk of getting infected by SARS -CoV-2 and of experiencing severe COVID -19, with a higher risk of severe COVID -19 defined as being hospitalized or deceased, compared to non - essential workers . 20 In March 2020 , the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( US-OSHA) classified essential worker types based on risk of occupational exposure to SARS -CoV-2. The level of risk depend ed on (i) the industry type, (ii) the need fo r contact within 6 feet of people known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS- CoV-2, and (iii) the requirement for repeated or extended contact with (a) person (s) known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS -CoV-2.21 In this Opinion, e ssential workers have been divided into large groups based on their involvement or lack of involvement in healthcare -related activities. Essen tial healthcare workers have been defined as \"all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials. This includes persons not directly involved in patient care , but potentially exposed to infectious agents while working in a healthcare setting. \"22 Informal carers fall into this group. All these individuals are referred to as the health workforce and include workers of varying levels of exposure risk . It is important to note that there are more women than men in many of the sectors defined as essential workers. In the EU, women make up 76% of healthcare workers , 76% of those working in the care sector, and 82% of supermarket cashiers.23 The European Institute for Gender Equality advocates for gender mainstreaming in crisis situations to ensure that increased challe nges to occupational health and wellbeing of women essential workers are recognised and addressed. Similarly, essential workers are disproportionately from minorities groups and also face increased challenges. 24 Essential workers and mental health As described in the mandate, cross-sectional survey data collected early in the COVID - 19 pandemi c from healthcare workers indicates that approximately half of them reported Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 20 symptoms of PTSD5, 25% reported symptoms of depression , 22% reported symptoms of stress, 20% reported anxiety symptoms, and 8% reported insomnia, with women more likely than men to experience symptoms of PTS and depression .4 A systematic review of 6 studies (1 from India and 5 from China), published in April 2020,25 support these findings. Regarding mental wellbeing in healthcare workers, 33% reported flourishing, 58% reported moderate wellbeing , and 9% reported languishing mental health.26 Regarding mental health in other essential workers, an online survey of various types of essential workers conducted during the last four weeks of lockdown for COVID -19 in the Hubei Province of China indicates that 25% reported moderate -to-severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 20% of farmers and economy staff reported moderate -to- severe depressive symptoms , while only 15% of teachers/government staff did. Approximately 12% of farmers and teachers/government staff reported moderate -to- severe stress, while 17% of economy staff did.27 Before examining factors that influence the mental health of essential worke rs in Chapter 3 and interventions (often times addressing these factors) in Chapter 4, there are several important caveats to note regarding the mental health outcomes available. Professor Sir Simon Wessely and his colleagues note a number of areas of conc ern about the research on mental health during the COVID -19 pandemic .28 Given data collection challenges during the pandemi c, our current knowledge of mental health in essential workers is primarily limited to self- reported responses to surveys. As a result, t here is a high potential for lack of representativeness, either due to low response rates, convenience sampling, and/or because of potential response bias with respect to who completes a survey (e.g., depending on the setting, it may be t hose most unwell , or least unwell if stigma, social desirability, and/or lack of confidentiality are potential issues). The descriptive cross- sectional nature of the surveys means that little knowledge concerning predictive factors of mental health issues is available, which implies a lack of targets for interventions. Because these surveys on mental health are not longitudinal, evidence for specific changes in mental health of essential workers compared to pre -pandemic levels is lacking. Moreover, e xamining groups of essential workers in isolation inhibits our understanding of whether the effect of the pandemic is different in essential workers from the general population. Increases in symptom reporting could be confounded by demographic differences such as gender and ethnicity. Although evidence from some countries suggests a decrease in mental health for the general populat ion compared to pre -pandemic levels (e.g., in the UK29), various longitudinal population cohort studies in the UK have found no increase in mental distress among healthcare workers.28 According to early reports, F innish workers' mental health has no t decreased dramatically due to the COVID -19 pandemic.30 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 21 A final limitation to take into account when examining research on supporting mental health in essential workers relates to the mental health outcomes available. As discussed in the previous chapter, both mental illness and mental wellbeing are independent dimensions of mental health. High levels of both symptoms of mental illness and wellbeing may co -exist, but most available research on mental health (both pre - pandemic and during the pandemic ) neglects the mental wellbeing and functioning dimension. Because mental health research , in general , tends to emphasize the mental illness dimension, available survey tools do not sufficiently distinguish between mental illness symptoms and impact on function. This distinction is important because dis tress can be considered a normal reaction to the COVID -19 pandemic, and certain responses to stress can even be considered beneficial for effectively dealing with a threat (see Walter Cannon's description the acute stress response, or fight -or-flight respo nse31). In other words, knowing the percent of individuals with anxiety or depressive symptoms or how they change as a result of an intervention may not refle ct how well the se individuals function. And it is the degree of functional impairment that ultimately signals a need for intervention. Little is known about the challenges that lead to functional impairment so that they can be targeted for earlier intervention (primary and secondary prevention in the framework), before care and treatment for those with ill mental health is required. In order to prepare for future crises, there is a need to develop survey tools that better distinguish mental illness from distress and measure the types of difficulties that need intervention. SARS- CoV-2 exposure and exposure -related concerns The association between SARS -CoV-2 and mental health problems in healthcare workers is well- established. SARS- CoV-2 exposure and exposure -related concerns also affect other essential workers, although less is known about the risk/protective factors for mental health with respect to other essential groups. Our review of the literature only identified data in this area specific to tran sit workers , revealing strong impacts . Burnout and Moral Injury: Risk factors for poor mental health in the health workforce The concept of post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been widely discussed in the literature with regard to healthcare workers and the current Covid -19 pandemic.32-34 There are two other distinct but related conditions that deserve attention : burnout and moral injury. All three conditions are associated with working in stressful situations and have been recognized in multiple occupations. Studies have sought to measure the frequency of these conditions, using standardized instruments, and have described varying associations.35-37 38 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 22 Here we consider both burnout and moral injury, and their overlaps with PTSD in cause and presentation . Management strategies for burnout and moral injury, along with other risk and protective factors, will be addressed in Chapter 3. Burnout In a major health crisis, such as a pandemic, the workload of health workers inevitably increases dramatically, potentially outs tripping the resources available, a problem that may be compounded by illness and, in some cases, deaths, among those involved in the response. In conditions such as these, there is an ever present risk of what is termed burnout, a condition characterised by \"feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy\".39 Burnout is also associated with a range of subsequent adverse mental health outcomes, including Major Depressive Disorder .40There are different responses to the conditions giving rise to burnout. Farber has described three.41 The first, which he termed \"wear -out\" or brown -out\", describes the situation where someone simply gives up in the face of excessive stress with inadequate reward. The second, which he termed classic or frenetic burno ut, was seen in individuals who were working ever harder to resolve their stressful situation or achieve a suitable reward. Finally, under -challenged burnout, where the stress level was low but the work was especially unrewarding. Burnout during the COVID -19 pandemic Even at the best of times, health care workers are susceptible to burnout. Their work is often intensive and emotionally challenging, dealing with patients and families facing emotional trauma, with many struggling to respond with empathy in the face of inadequate resources and other demands on their time. During the pandemic, they have faced additional stressors. The pressure of markedly increased workload has been accentuated by prolonged wearing of personal protective equipment, and with it the risks of overheating and dehydration, as well as the effects of placing a physical barrier between themselves and their patients.42 There have been many studies that have measured the prevalence of burnout during the pandemic, mostly using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) . While most have found elevated rates of burnout, many lack appropriate controls to assess how these figures relate to the pre -pandemic period. Furthermore, c omparisons of health workers on the frontline of the COVID -19 response and others have been conflicting. The limit ed available evidence suggests that some individuals may be at particular risk of burnout because of their personal circumstances. S tudies found that those who had children or family members over the age of 65 with a chronic illness were at increased risk ,43 women are especially at risk of burnout, in some cases linking this to concerns about their families ,44 perceived adequacy of PPE was associated with a lower risk of burnout ,45 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 23 and there was higher frequency of burnout among those working longer hours and who had been redeployed away from their usual work setting.46 The implications of burnout Research carried out prior to the pandemic emphasizes the consequences of b urnout for health care workers. A systematic review of longitudinal studies found that burnout was a predictor of adverse outcomes in three areas :47 (i) physical outcomes included type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hospitalization due to cardiovascular disorder, musculoskeletal pain, prolonged fatigue, headaches, severe injurie s and mortality at age under 45; (ii) psychological consequences include insomnia, depressive symptoms, use of psychotropic and antidepressant medications, and other mental disorders. (iii) occupational consequences include absenteeism, new disability pension, and presenteeism. It also has implications for patients. There is an extensive body of research, much based on studies on Magnet \u00ae hospitals48, which are hospitals th at are recognized for having created cultures that attract and retain nursing staff. These studies have shown that lower levels of burnout among nurses are associated with better patient outcomes, often mediated by a reduced level of what is termed \"failur e to rescue\", where deterioration in a patient's condition is not detected or acted on.49,50 In the current pandemic, it has been shown that mortality is almost 20% higher in intensive care units operating at the highest level of intensity.51 Moral injury Although there is no consensus definition of the term moral injury, Shay conceptualises moral injury as \"a character wound that stems from a betrayal of justice by a person of authorit y in a high -stakes situation\" .52 Litz and colleagues (2009) define a potentially morally injurious event (PMIE) as one that entails \"perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations .\"53 Although mu ch of the initial research focused upon moral injury in military personnel and veterans, a recent narrative review recognised many disciplines that have researched moral injury , including psychiatry, social work, philosophy and religious/spiritual54, as well as health care. Moral injury is not a mental illness in itself, but those who develop moral injuries are likely to experience negative thoughts about themselves and others .55 A systematic review of occupational moral injury and mental health in 2018 recognised that these symptoms can contribute to developing mental health issues such as depression, PTSD, anxiety and even suicidal ideation . 56 An overlap between moral injury and PTSD has been acknowledged , for example, if the index event that the individual was exposed to is both potentially life -threatening and morally injurious .57 Litz and colleagues53 also indicate that PTSD and moral injury share similar consequences with regards to re -experiencing the traumatic event and avoidance Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 24 or numbing. The individual's role in the event can be victim or witness in both PTSD and moral injury, and the role of perpetrator is a characteristic of moral injury only. PTSD and moral injury are different with respect to the triggering event. In PTSD i t is actual or threated death or serious injury, while in moral injury it is acts that violate deeply held moral values. The necessity that is lost is different. In PTSD it is safety and in moral injury it is trust. This leads to differences in the predominant painful emotion. PTSD causes fear, horror, and/or helplessness, while moral injury causes guilt, shame, and anger. Lastly, PTSD involves psychological arousal, while as moral injury does not. The difference between burnout and moral injury is im portant because using different terminology reframes the problems. 58 Burnout traditionally suggests that the problem resides within the individual, who is in some way deficient and lacks the resources or resilience to withstand the work environment.58 This view is changing such that burnout is now often seen to be a problem with the work environment. Moral injury , from the outset, sets the problem at the organisation and with leadership. Moral Injury during the COVID -19 pandemic Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, t here was evidence of \"an existing baseline of psychological pathology\" and low morale in healthcare workers ,59 even before moral injury is considered. Although the pandemic can be viewed as a natural disaster, the reactions of those 'in legitimate authority' will be perceived by many, including healthcare workers, as 'a betrayal of what is right' .59 Furthermore, a lack of resources, inadequate clear guidance, or insufficient training may also mean staff perceive that their own health is not being considered by their employers.60 \"Anticipatory guilt\", seeing healthcare colleagues in other co untries already experiencing the adverse effects of the pandemic, has also been recognised.61 For those healthcare workers that needed to quarantine, research identified feelings of guilt, plus fear they [healthcare workers] can contaminate their own families and conflict about their roles.62,63 It remains unclear which staff will become very distressed during quarantine, but the conditions of qua rantine can make healthcare workers anxious to return to work.59 The challenges described here, within the context of scarce specific resources,60 and treatment decisions that may differ from when a disease is less virul ent59 can be argued a s being analogous to the PMIEs initially proposed by Litz and colleagues.53 In the current Covid -19 pandemic, potential risk factors for moral injury identified include: If there is loss of life to a vulnerable person If leaders are perceived not to take responsibility for events/are unsupportive of staff If staff feel unaware or unprepared for the emotional/psychological consequences of decisions Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 25 If the PMIE occurs concurrently to exposure to other traumatic events (e.g. , death of loved one) If there is a lack of social support following the PMIE . 60 It should be noted that not all PMIEs lead onto individual healthcare staff experiencing moral injury. Four different reactions to \"disaster\" have been identified64 that range from \"not upset at all\" to \"mentally disordered\". Moreover, t he concept of 'post -traumatic growth', with a bolstering of resilience, esteem, outlook and values, has also been recognised.65 It is also important to note that many profound reactions of staff will be still within what is considered a 'normal' reaction and will not constitute mental health pathology .59 Implications of the identification of moral injury in the health workforce For healthcare workers in the current pandemic, which is comparable with war due to global death toll ,59 and w ith some now exposed to PMIEs for over a year without pause, supporting the mental health of those individuals who need it , is a critical part of the public health response .59 Although r esour ces have traditionally been put towards supporting staff once they have developed mental health pathology, it has been suggested that a shift in focus is required from individual to organisation ,59 and prevention and mitigation is more important t han cure .66 Other risk and protective factors for mental health during the COVID -19 pandemic Beyond fear of becoming infected, a rapid systematic review on the psychological impact of COVID -19 and other viral epidemics on frontline healthcare workers emphas ized risk factors related to fear of the unknown, threats to their own mortality, stigma by society and/or family members, and working long hours. 67 Various systematic reviews identify social support as a commonly reported protective factor for mental health in the health workforce .68 67 Risk and protective factors associated with mental health in other essential worker groups during the COVID -19 pandemic has not been sufficiently studied to draw conclusions. Risk and protective factors for mental health of essential workers in crisis situations For n on-healthcare and non -uniformed responders , parallels have been drawn between the mental health response of essential workers to 9/11 and the mental health impact of the COVID -19 pandemic.69 In particular, an 8 -year follow -up study found tha t non - traditional 9/11 responders (e.g. , construction, clean -up, and asbestos workers; city employees; and volunteers) had consistently higher rates of PTSD than uniformed responders (e.g., police).70 Importantly, this group mostly lacked disaster response experience and found themselves taking on tas ks well outside the scope of their jobs, often not by choice but due to economic necessity .69 It is possible to infer similar Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 26 consequences on mental health to other groups of non -healthcare essential workers who were unprepared to cope with the consequences of the COVID -19 pandemic . Impacts of pandemics on healthcare workers have already been discussed in literature prior to the current C OVID -19 pandemic, within the context of previous infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS.62,71 Increased workload, fears of contagion, working with new and frequently changing protocols, barriers to usual communication and care with the use of PPE, and caring for patients who quickly dete riorate were all recognised as challenges. Furthermore, constant news coverage blurs the lines between home and work. 71 Kisely and colleagues conducted a rapid review and meta -analysis of the psychological effects of emerging virus outbreaks on healthcare workers.72 Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed to psychological distre ss. Protective factors for mental health included clear communication, access to adequate PPE, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated. Table 1 provides a summary of these risk and protective factors. Table 1. Factors that increased or decreased risk of adverse psychological outcomes in healthcare workers in emerging virus outbreaks prior to COVID -19 Factor Level Risk Factors Protective Factors Individual, clinical - Increased contact with infected patients - Precautionary measures creating perceived impediment to doing job - Forced re -deployment to look after affected patients - Higher risk among nurses + Frequent short breaks from clinical duties + Adequate time off work + Faith in precautionary measures + Self-perception of being adequately trained and supported + Working in an administrative or managerial role Individual, training and experience - Inadequate training - Lower levels of education - Part-time employee - Less clinical experience + Greater experience through years worked Individual, personal - Increased time in quarantine - Staff with children at home - Personal lifestyle impact by epidemic/pandemic - Infected family member - Single or social isolation - Female sex - Lower household income - Comorbid physical health conditions - Younger age Individual, psychological - Lower perceived personal self-efficacy - History of psychological distress, mental health disorders, or substance misuse + Supportive peers + Family support Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 27 Service - Perceived lack of organisational support - Perceived lack of adequacy of training - Lack of confidence in infection control - No compensation by staff by organisation + Positive feedback to staff + Staff faith in service's infection control procedures + Provision of protective gear +Effective staff training in preparation for outbreaks + Staff support protocols + Clear communication with staff + No infection among staff after start of strict protective measures + Infected colleagues getting better + Access to tailored psychological interventions based on needs of individual staff Societal - Social stigma against hospital workers + A general drop in disease transmission Source: Kisley, et al. (2020)72 Additional occupational health and economic risk factors influencing the mental health of essential workers in general An umbrella review on work -related stress risk and preventive measures73 identified the following groups of occupational risk factors that influence mental health and deserve attention when considering actions to support the mental health of essential work ers: - Role: Conflicts, violence, responsibility, role am biguity, sense of powerlessness - Relationships: Colleagues' support, senior's support, subordinates (e.g. nurses), communication, bullying - Control : Limited control over the practice, dissatisfaction, l ack of autonomy - Factors intrinsic to the job : Workloads, shift work (night shifts in particular), work time, medical errors, medico -legal concerns - Organizational environment : Participation in decision making, inadequate leisure time, excessive bureaucracy , absenteeism, reward system - Career : Job security, career opportunities, promotion prospects/salary, unpaid overtime In addition, the physical environment of the workplace and workspace has been shown to influence mental health,74 includ ing factors such as temperature, noise, lighting ,75 and access to private space.76 Recessions There is evidence suggesting that recessions are generally bad for mental health. A systematic review on the effect of economic recessions on mental health outcomes provides consistent evidence that economic recessions and mediators such as unemployment, income decline, and unmanageable debts are significantly associated with p oor mental wellbeing , increased rates of common mental disorders, substance - related disorders, and suicidal behaviours. 77 The authors warn however that the research Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 28 is based on cross -sectional studies, which limits causality inferences. The Great Recession in Europe and North America was associated with at least 10,000 additional economic suicides between 2008 and 2010.78 A literature review on the health consequences of recessions in the US provides consistent evidence that recessions, and unemployment in particular, can be significantly damaging to mental health, increasing the risk of substance abuse and suicide particularly for young men. 79 The October 2008 stock market crash in the US increased feelings of depression and use of antidepressant drugs, but did not lead to increases in clinically validated measures of depressive symptoms or indicators of depression. 80 A system atic review suggested that periods of economic crisis might be linked to an increase of general help sought for mental health problems, with conflicting results regarding the changes in the use of specialised psychiatric care. It also suggests that economi c crises might be associated with a higher use of prescription drugs and an increase in hospital admissions for mental disorders. 81 However, n ot all individuals are equally affected by economic crises or recessions, illustrating the interplay between diffe rent types of occupational and non -occupational factors . For example, the prevalence of mental health problems in England increased markedly since 2008, and such increases were greatest in people with less education and people out of work.82 Gender differences have also been identified ; for instance, the 2008 recession in Spain was associated with an increase in prevalence of risk of poor mental health in men, but with a reduction in women. 83 The role of pre- existing mental health conditions Mental health conditions are common. Prior to the pandemic, the global lifetime prevalen ce for common psychological disorders was estimated to be 29.2%.84 Moreover, common mental health conditions \u2014 such as mood, anxiety and substance use disorders85 \u2014 have been found to be common among the working population,86 particularly amongst healthcare workers.87 People with ment al health conditions have a lower life expectancy and generally poorer health outcomes than those with no psychological conditions, due to a complex combination of socioeconomic and behavioural risk factors, often accentuated by barriers to accessing care. 88 In many countries, the COVID -19 pandemic has led to a significant disruption of mental health services,89 while non- pharmaceutical interventions to control the pandemic, such as quarantine and physical distancing, while necessary to interrupt transmission of infection, pose risks to both ph ysical and mental health .90,91 Taken together, these considerations have given rise to concerns that the current pan demic could cause relapse or exacerbation of existing psychiatric conditions.92 However, the full impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the mental health of those with a history of mental ill-health is still not fully understood, including amongst essential workers. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 29 Impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on those with pre -existing mental health disorders People with pre -existing mental health problems were recognised early on in the pandemic as a group likely to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic and associated control measures.92 Therefore, they were considered to be particularly vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes.93 Evidence from previous novel viral outbreaks found that pre -existing psychological ill -health was associated with worse psychological outcomes.72 However, research on the impact of the current COVID -19 pandem ic on this group has produced mixed results. Certain mental health conditions \u2014 such as anxiety -related disorders \u2014 may be especially at risk of being aggravated by the pandemic.94 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that people with pre -existing mental health conditions experienced clinically and statistically significantly higher rates of psychiatric symptoms (including anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia) during pandemics compared to those in control groups. 95 However, noting inadequacies in the designs of many of the studies included in the review, the authors urge caution in attributing these outcomes to the pandemic (as opposed to selection bias due to the nature of sampling, often involving those in contact with health services). The authors recommend improved research methodologies \u2014 particularly the need for longitudinal studies where data were available on pre -pandemic psychiatric morbidity and symptom severity \u2014 in order to allow for causal associations to be made. The review findings support the urgent need for accessible mental health services to address the high levels of psychiatric symptoms experienced by people with pre- existing mental illnesses during this \u2014 and likely future \u2014 pandemics. A recent ly published longitudinal study of three existing Dutch cohorts (not included in the aforementioned systematic review) confirmed that the symptom severity of people with depressive, anxiety or obsessive -compulsive disorder was systematically higher than in individuals without mental health disorders, but found that pre -existing mental ill-health did not necessarily predispose to a greater level of emotional reactivity to the pandemic. 96 The authors acknowledge, however, that data were only collected during the first month of the national lockdown in the Netherlands and, therefore, may not necessarily capture the longer -term effect of the pandemic on those with pre -existing mental health conditions. Based on these results, the authors highlight the importance of maintaining access t o mental health services during the pandemic and the pressing need for further research to understand the longer- term impact of the pandemic on mental health. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 30 1.3. What interventions could be effective in addressing mental health support needs of health workers and other essential workers, including those with pre -existing mental health conditions? For the purposes of addressing th is mandate question, we conducted a search in PUBMED and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews, reviews of reviews, meta- analysis, effectiveness, or cost -effectiveness publications considering interventions for mental health in health workforce and/or other essential workers as defined in the mandate. Specific interventions targeting burnout and moral injury were included in the search. The focus of this chapter is on interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic or past outbreaks. When necessary in order to fill gaps in the available research, literature from pre -pandemic studies is descri bed. Limitations and challenges associated with the research concerning the effectiveness of interventions to support the mental health of essential workers include the following issues: 1. Our understanding of mental health (based on the two -dimensional mo del of mental illness and mental wellbeing ) and its aetiology is poor. The use of a biomedical model of health can be unhelpful for mental health research. 2. Mental health is very broad in its scope. The problems studied are very different, ranging from (sy mptoms of) depression, anxiety or insomnia to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), suicide ideation, PTSD, addictions, or chronic conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Interventions to support the mental wellbeing dimension are understudied. 3. Measuring mental health outcomes is extremely challenging. They are often poorly defined and subjective. Mental illness often has a chronic course and individuals frequently meet the diagnostic criteria for more than one mental health problem so it is di fficult to separate out one problem from another. 4. Interventions to address mental health do not always lead themselves too well to being studied using traditional randomized controlled trial designs. Talking therapies and similar interventions are complex and context dependent. They are often tailored to the individual and have components, such as the relationship with the therapist, which can be difficult to standardise. 5. Our understanding of mechanisms by which intervention work is rudimentary. Interventions to influence mental health are often complex and multi -component, which means it can be challenging to separate out effects of particular components or determine the \"active ingredient\" of a given intervention. Furthermore, components often i nteract with other factors. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 31 6. Many interventions to support mental health show promising results in the short run, while the intervention is on- going, but impact may disappear in the long run. 7. When examining systematic reviews of interventions to support men tal health, the definitions of effectiveness can be vague and vary from study to study. Moreover, similar m ental health concepts can be assessed using many different scales, which can make comparison of effectiveness of interventions across studies difficu lt. 8. From the few economic evaluations on worksite mental health interventions , many lack methodological quality or lack evidence to support evidence -based decision making . 9. It is important to keep in mind that achieving the best outcomes depends upon providing the right type of intervention to the correct population at the right time. One size might not fit all and direct programmes to the ones most at risk might increase the cost -effectiveness of promising interventions. Taken together, research on effectiveness of mental health interventions is generally poor. At the same time, preliminary evidence is promising. In order to support the mental health of essential workers, the workplace itself becomes an important context for the implement ation of appropriate interventions. These intervention s can occur on various levels - there are policy -level (e.g., economic and social), organisational, task -job, and individual orientations. Interventions are also classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention. As shown in the conceptual framework (see Figure 2) , primary interventions are proactive by nature . Primary prevention prevent s exposure to a known risk factor and keeps harmful effects from emerging . Primary prevention may also enhance an individual's tolerance or resilience in order to manage or cope more effectively with a stressor. Secondary prevention efforts happen before mental health causes a detrimental impact on function. Secondary interventions reverse, reduce or slow the progression of ill -health and preclinical conditions or to increase individual resources. Such secondary approaches may include both early detection and early treatment , with the aim of reducing the severity or duration of symptoms and /or to halt or sl ow the further development of more serious and potentially disabling conditions. Lastly, tertiary interventions are rehabilitative by nature . They reduc e negative impacts and heal existing damages. Tertiary prevention efforts aim to treat and manage a diag nosed condition and minimize its impact on daily functioning . Examples of tertiary interventions include rehabilitation, relapse prevention, providing access to resources and support, and promoting reintegration in the workforce. The EU -Compass for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing97 has identified some additional limitations concerning interventions in the workplace to support mental health. First, intervention studies primarily address individual outcomes. Multi-modal Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 32 approaches, and especially mea sures implemented at organisational level, are important . These types of studies must be promoted and evaluated. Evaluation should include both process and ou tcome aspects, in order to capture effects that might otherwise go unnoticed. Emphasis on primary prevention is warranted that addresses risk factors in the work environment and integrates individuals affected by mental ill health in the workforce by providing appropriate support. Second, there is a lack of studies in small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) . This is concerning because SMEs are widely acknowledged to be in need of appropriate support in terms of awareness and action implementation when it comes to mental health in the workplace. EU-level efforts should assist them in risk assessment and implementation of good practices where available . Third, much current knowledge focuses on mental i ll health and negative impacts, with c omparatively less evidence on the impact of positive psychological wellbeing in a healthy work environment. Further research is needed that expand s the range of factors and outcomes examined to include wellbeing , flour ishing, vitality and sustainability. Potentially effective interventions to protect mental health of essential workers should therefore be complex and multi -faceted, address ing modifiable risk factors identified in the prior chapter of this Opinion, and be implemented on multiple levels. Interventions in mental health of essential workers Our literature search resulted in effectiveness research of interventions to support the mental health of the health workforce during the COVID -19 pandemic or in the context of previous emerging disease outbreaks (e.g., SARS, Ebola, MERS). Most of these studies are pre -dominantly concerned with hospital settings, with a lack of evidence related to social care staff or primary care staff. This is concerning because of t he large proportion of deaths occurring in the community and specifically in residential care homes. Moreover, t here is an important gap in research regarding interventions to support the mental health of other groups of non-healthcare essential workers during emerging disease outbreaks . These gaps must be rectified in the future as well. Mental health i nterventions in essential, primary h ealthcare , workers A rapid systematic review examining the mental health impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on healthcar e workers and interventions to support psychological wellbeing highlights the poor study design of most studies, reflecting the urgency of the pandemic, and therefore a need to incorporate high -quality research in p andemic preparedness planning. 87 Similarly, a Cochrane mixed methods systematic review evaluating interventions to support the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemics that included COVID -19 identified 16 studies. The se studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support or work -based interventions. No Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 33 evidence regarding how well different strategies work ed to support the resilience and mental wellbeing of frontline workers was found .98 However, other reviews do suggest that some interventions are effective in supporting the mental health of the health force and other essential workers. Furthermore, it may be possible to transfer interventions with proven effectiveness in different populations or in different contexts to essential workers in the COVID -19 pandemi c. Effectiveness of individual -level interventions A rapid review of stress reduction techniques i n health care providers dealing with severe coronavirus infect ions (SARS, MERS, and COVID -19)99 provides preliminary support for the value of Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions for crisis intervention .72 Specifically, basic CBT skills may be effective in treating the anxiety and depression in the health workforce when paired with Psychological First Aid (PFA) principles.100 72 Psychological First Aid (PFA) is recommended for use in serious crisis events by the WHO101 and includes the management of basic sa fety needs (for example, food and water, information); practical care and support; empathic listening; increasing social support; providing mental health support and referrals as needed; and protection from further harm.102 Focusing on values clarification may help essential workers feel a renewed sense of purpose and meaning in their careers and with their families during a crisis like COVID -19. 100 Therefore, evidence suggests that workplaces should first focus on meeting the employees' basic needs, including safety, eating, and sleeping modifications where possible, while incorporating warmth, empathic listening, and validation. Of note, systematic reviews published prior to the COVID -19 pandemic provide some additional evidence for the effectiveness of individual- level intervention to support the mental health of the health workforce . A 2015 Cochrane review103 examining the prevention of occupational stress in healthcare workers concluded that CBT training , as well as mental and physical relaxation , all reduce stress moderate ly. In another systematic review of interventions to improve the psychological wellbeing of general practitioners, four studies reported statistically significant improvement in self -reported mental ill- health. Two interventions used CBT, one was mindfulness -based, and one fed - back General Health Questionnaire scores and self -help information .104 Lastly, arts -based intervention may be a promising individual- level intervention to support the mental health of essential workers. Arts-based intervention includes music, movement, creative arts classes, participatory arts classes, arts activities, visual arts, art appreciation classes, collages and drawing classes, poetry therapy, and stories and diary writing work. A number of individual studies demonstrate the effectiveness of arts -based interventions to support the mental health of healthcare workers and its effectiveness in health and social care settings . 105 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 34 Regarding the general population of workers, a systematic review on interventions for common mental disorders in the occupational health servic e prior to the COVID -19 pandemic suggests that only a few studies provide evidence for effective prevention among employees at risk.106 Yet, a systematic review and meta -analysis of web -based psychological interventions delivered in the workplace indicates that occupational digital mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological wellbeing and increase work effectiveness.107 Greater engagement and adherence was associated with interventions that are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users [i.e., emails and text messages (short message service, SMS), and use elements of persuasive technology (i.e., self -monitoring and tailoring). Effectiveness of workplace - and societal -level interventions In broad terms , effective interventions involve increasing social and societal support and numerous workplace interventions, from communication and training to infection control, to workload management, and offering personal s upport.72 Indeed, according to the data collected by the COVID -19 Health Systems Response Monitor108, during COVID -19 pandemic (even as early as April 2020 in s ome countries) most European countries took action to enable mental health and wellbeing of healthcare workers that included particular workplace provisions, e.g. supply ing PPE , as well as assuring rest and limiting working time periods. Recent analysis by EuroHealthNet109 confirm s that the predominant initiatives involve d direct mental health interventions and financial support, sometimes taking the form of free transportation, accommodation and/or childcare. Countries in whi ch healthcare workers earn relatively low wages paid particular attention to financial compensation for work performed. Direct mental health interventions mostly comprised of newly established helplines and remote consultations from trained professionals. Although the effectiveness of these particular interventions to support the mental health of essential workers is unknown, the use of helplines and remote consultations is in line with an exploratory study of Chinese healthcare workers in which 30% indicated they wanted to receive one- on-one psychological counselling and 24% wanted crisis management intervention. 110 In February 2021, the WHO and International L abour Organization issued interim guidance based on new and emerging evidence to ensure occupational health and safety for health workers in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition to hazard control to prevent occupational COVID -19 infections, the guidance recommends fatigue prevention by managing shift lengths, balancing workloads, and establishing adequate periods of rest and recuperation. A number of workplace level interventions to support health workers' mental health are highlighted, includi ng survellience, communication, Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 35 peer support, access to confidential support services, and addressing stigma and discrimination111. Based on experiences from emerging virus outbreaks prior to COVID -19, one rapid review and meta -analysis clearly indicates that most effective interventions to support the mental health of the health workforce are workplace -level interventions. Specifically, these interventions occur within the organisation by senior management and managerial staff addressing team and organisational fac tors such as communication and training, infection control, employee workload, psychological support for employees, and personal support for employees. 72 A 2015 Cochrane review103 examining the prevention of occupational stress in healthcare workers also concluded that changing work schedules was effective to reduce stress. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 public health guideline on Mental Wellbeing at Work112 (currently under revision as of 2018), recommendations focused on employers' actions upon improvement of workplace conditions. The EU Joint Action CHRODIS (2014- 2016) and CHRODIS+ ( 2017- 2020) was funded to carry out 17 policy dialogues and implement 21 projects to improve actions for combatting chronic diseases. The outcomes of the CHRODIS+ area \"Employment and Chronic Diseases\" are particularly relevant to supporting the mental heal th of essential workers. Specifically, a Toolkit for Workplaces created as part of Work Package 8 synthesizes best practices related to Fostering Employees' Wellbeing , Health, and Work Participation. 113 The Toolkit facilitates identifying workplace strengths. The Toolkit appendix contains a checklist to assess what approaches and means are currently in use in an organization and map -analy se-plan guide to tailor a program intervention. Within each domain, the toolkit describes ideas for concrete actions to (1) strengthen knowledge and skills, (2) create supporting working environment (physical, social, and digital environments are addressed), (3) adopt wellbeing -fostering policies, and (4) incenti vize. Of the seven domains covered in the Toolkit, implementation of practices related to (i) Mental health and wellbeing, (ii) Recovery from work, and (iii) Community spirit and atmosphere are acknowledged as useful to help support the mental health of essential workers. Effectiveness of coordinated and/or integrated a pproaches Integrated protective approaches provided by senior management, for instance, are recommended to safeguard the mental health of healthcare workers over the use of separate mental h ealth intervention strategies . 114 Also, systems -level interventions should be made readily available to healthcare workers, and extended to other essential workers and non -essential workers, during and beyond the COVID -19 pandemic .115 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 36 Major and Hlubocky (2021)116 encourage integration of strategies and frameworks into larger organizational mental health frameworks. A national -level comprehensive approach to mental health of healthcare workers may offer a possible solution. The draft of Australian framework \"Every Doctor, Every Setting\"117 is an example of a national - level effort aiming to coordinate action to prevent mental ill -health and suicidal behaviour and support good mental health for all doctors and medical students through 5 action pillars : primary, secondary, and tertiary prev ention, mental health promotion and leadership. Coordinated and/or integrated approaches to manage burnout Effectiveness of coordinated and/or integrated approaches is particularly evidenced in the management of burnout. There is widespread agreement that burnout should be viewed primarily as an organisational problem rather than an individual one. Although there is a temptation to medicalise the problems faced by affected individuals, the evidence in favour of individualised interventions is limited, even though there is some evidence of overlap between the symptoms of workers experiencing burnout and other patients with clinical depression, 118,119 especially so for those with marked symptoms of exhaustion. However, while the manifestations may be similar, burnout has a specific aetiology arising from the work environment. In other words, an appropriate response should focus o n working conditions rather than on the individual affected. Given thes e considerations, there is broad consensus that the most appropriate measures to prevent burnout from arising combine organisational change with support for the individual affected. Burnout is most likely where there is a disconnection between the organisation and the individual in six areas of their working life, workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values.120 Consequently, an effective response will involve a comprehensive approach to all of these, involving changes in the individual and the organisation. A systematic review and meta -analysis, which examined 20 independent comparisons from 19 studies, found that while there was evidence that both organisational and individual interventions were effective, the effect size was significantly greater for the former.121 A first step is to ensure that the individual concerned has adequate resources to meet the demands placed upon them. It is also important for the individual to be able to see that the organisation has values that recogni se their contribution to it, for example by emphasising the importance of supportive leadership and relationships with colleagues.120 It is particularly important to address perceived unfairness, with one study finding decreased exhaustion, although not improvements in depersonalisation, following the implementation of weekly meetings to examine and resolve perceived inequities in the working environment.122 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 37 The evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeted at the individual are less encouraging, at least when adopted without corresponding changes in the working environment, although in part this is because the studies that have been conducted are often small or evaluate outcomes over a short time frame. For example, a trial of an intervention to teach physicians about the psychology of burnout, stress, coping with patient death, and managing di stress did find a reduction in symptoms of burnout but this was only measured at seven days post -intervention.123 Other studies have focused on general stress relieving measures, such as yoga,124 exercise, and training in stress management. Others have involved cognitive behavioural therapy and re laxation techniques, although a Cochrane review found only low- quality evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy, mental or physical relaxation, or changing work schedules.125 In reality, changes to the organisation of the workplace that would be desirable in normal circumstances will be extremely difficult during a pandemic. Consequently, it is necessary to look for other measures that might be able to mitigate the consequences of the conditions that give rise to burnout. Although evidence of effectiveness is limited, one group of authors h as advoc ated what they term \"micro -practices\", activities that require minimal time to learn and implement. Examples include taking a minute to reflect on one's wellbeing , including hunger and hydration, while using hand sanitiser.126 Another has suggested a series of practical measures that encapsulate established best practice in creating a work environment conducive to supporting the mental health of the health workforce,127 and can be extended to other essential and non -essential workers. Box 1. Best practice in cre ating a work environment conducive to supporting the mental health of the health workforce Provide clear messages that clinicians are valued and that managing th e pandemic together is the goal. Provide work schedules that promote physical resilience, enabling adequate sleep with access to rooms for those working long or multiple shifts, easy access to water, healthy snacks, chargers for phones and other devices, and toiletries, and designated times for clinicians to take breaks, eat, and take medications. Reduce noncritical work activities, such as eliminating no n-essential administrative tasks. Provide a central source for updated information and clear communication of well - defined protocols, expectations, an d such resources as childcare via e -mails, tweets, and automated calls. Encourage clinicians to openly discuss vulnerability and the importance of protecting one's emotional strength. Foster spiritual resilience through distribution of positive messaging t hat emphasizes appreciation for clinicians' dedication and altruism, including sharing stories of success, rather than focusing on failures and stresses. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 38 Develop an evidence- based menu of interventions tailored to diverse workplace settings, including well ness committees and employee assistance programs, informed by surveys to assess stress points, fears, and concerns. Source: Dewey et al, 2020127 Coordinated and/or integrated approaches to support mental health Numerous coordinated and/or integrated strategies were initially developed to address moral injury and derived from research within the military and with veterans. The findings can potentially be applied to both healthcare and allied settings, and extended to other essential workers and non -essential workers as well. It has been proposed that strategies to address moral injury can be divided into before, during, and after the crisis. 55 Before Military research has recognised that preparing staff for the job and associated challenges reduces the risk of mental health problems .128 In the healthcare setting, workers \"should not be given false reassurances, but a full and frank assessment of what they will face .\"55 It has also been suggested that organisations should \"immediately reflect on the challenges the staff faced at baseline\" , such as shift -working and workload, that can all impact on wellbeing .59 During Individuals benefit from tangible and practical support .71 During a crisis, organisations can support staff in a range of practical ways, as summarised in Box 2 . Psychological support should be offered to all staff in quarantine ,59 and drop -in psy chological support , an effective intervention recognised in previous outbreaks ,129 provided for those working. However, the availability of support will vary and is likely to be scarce .59 Remote psychological support mechanisms need to be considered in the context of pandemics, via digital platforms available .59 While peer support has its place, off -loading to a relative stranger can also be useful to staff .59 Routine support available to staff should include a briefing on moral injuries, as well as an awareness of other causes of mental ill health and what to look out for. 55 Box 2. Proposed ways that organisations can support the mental health of workers during a pandemic Providing food, drink and rest facilities Ensuring staff do not exceed safe hours by encouraging reporting and monitoring of hours, and preparing reinforcements so staff can take annual leave and breaks Focusing on dynamic workload management and clear role expectations Proactively addressing resource inequities across the organisation Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 39 Proactively resolving housing or transport issues for staff to reduce anxiety of infecting family members and safely travelling to and from work Regular situational updates for all staff, including realistic and frank information about risk and adverse events, e.g. report of death among colleagues or advising staff to write a will Regular praise for s taff and acknowledgement of the unprecedented and exceptional circumstances Being visible on the ground throughout the pandemic (managers, senior staff) Clear messaging, rationale and guidance for changing standards of practice Encouraging a two -way dialog ue and being open to suggestions and ideas from staff Facilitating debriefs and morale building communal time Designing rotas so that teams can stay together (despite migrating through changing shift times) throughout the pandemic Being clear that staff sa fety is the number one priority Providing adequate PPE and identifying/removing high- risk staff from frontline work to reduce anxiety for becoming infected Providing education on the normal responses to extreme stress to reassure staff Educating team leade rs on debriefing practices and the needs of individuals Providing formal and informal psychological support Ensuring staff in quarantine are regularly supported and communicated with during and after their isolation Planning specifically for supporting tea ms if colleagues are critically ill or deceased Ensuring there is appropriate support for different staff grades and disciplines, e.g. doctors and nurses, as well as porters and cleaning staff Keeping up to date with evolving guidance on supporting staff a nd recommendations Source: Walton etal., 202059 The role of leadership, in its visibility, humanity and flexibility during a crisis, is crucial - maintaining honesty in communication whilst remaining calm, and empowering individuals within teams to become their own leaders .59 It is also important to recognise that th e prolonged nature of the pandemic, and the likelihood of ongoing high levels of absenteeism for both physical and psychological reasons, means the \"baton of leadership will need to be passed between people during the marathon .\" 59 More senior man agers should keep an active eye on more junior ones and check how they are doing .55 Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 40 Colleagues can support each other spotting early signs of concerns in themselves and others, offering colleague s the opportunity to talk, signposting to psychological services, being kind to each other and encouraging self -care; those co -ordinating psychological support in departments should offer debrief/supervision sessions for peer supporters.59 After Formal psychological support for those in front -line roles affected by Covid -19 should be prioritised and readily accessible, as lengthy waits for treatment are recognised as a reason why people to do seek it . 60 Of note, individuals with moral injury related mental health disorders are often reticent to speak about guilt or shame, and may focus on classically traumatic elements ; 60 any psychological screening n eeds to be mindful of this presentation. 'Active monitoring', as defined in guidance for PTSD, is also advised 130. Specific ongoing psychological interventions proposed in the context of moral injury include Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) to reduce trauma related guilt, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), aimed to promote non -judgemental acceptance of internal experiences, and Adaptive Disclosure (AD), targeting recognised mechanisms of moral repair.54 One-off psychological debriefs are felt to be unhelpful in moral injury, as are some standardised treatment for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure .60,131 Safe multidisciplinary spaces to discuss clinical cases and reflect upon their impact, such as Schwarz rounds, are also cited as another mechanism to for healthcare workers to discuss difficult emotional and social issues arising from patient care .132,133 Interventions to address the mental health needs of essential workers with pre-existing mental health conditions Consistent with the gaps in knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on those with pre - existing mental health conditions in the essential worker population, there is a lack of robust evidence for the effectiveness of interventions designed to address the mental health needs of this group who may be at particular risk. A rapid review of the evidence for mental health interventions d uring COVID -19 and other pandemics found that whilst research on effectiveness of interventions was growing, few studies distinguished between new mental health problems triggered by medical pandemics and those that were pre -existing, with the suggested fi nding that training healthcare workers in resilience may be particularly effective for those with a history of mental ill -health . 134 Moreover, the authors advocate for the provision of a wide range of mental health support services t hat can meet the diverse needs of groups with different vulnerabilities and risks (a recommendation common to other papers on this subject 92,94). An article on early interventions to supp ort hospital staff during COVID -19 raises a particularly important issue, pertinent to those with pre -existing mental health conditions, which requires attention.135 The authors sugges t that employers should Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 41 consider how best to monitor staff with pre -existing mental ill- health and ensure the adequate provision of additional support for this vulnerable group. Whilst an important recommendation, employers should be conscious that those e xperiencing psychological ill-health may be subject to stigma and discrimination, particularly in the workplace.136 As a result, efforts in the workplace to support those with pre -existing mental health conditions should be accompanied by due consideration of legal and ethical responsibilities \u2014 such as protecting employee confidentiality and preventing workplace discrimination 137 \u2014 so as to avoid the potentially adverse consequences of singling out a particular group. In healthcare settings, peer support programmes \u2014 which enable healthcare teams to support and monitor each other \u2014 have been proposed, as has training of team leaders to identify more serious mental health issues.138 A number of other relevant recommendations \u2014 particularly with regards to future research priorities and design of interventions \u2014 to support the mental health needs of those with pre -existing mental health cond itions can be found within the academic literature. Even at the start of the pandemic, the requirement for coordinated, multi -disciplinary research to understand and reduce mental health issues in vulnerable groups \u2014 such as healthcare workers and those w ith pre -existing mental health conditions \u2014 was recognised as a priority for further study.139 In particular, experts have called for high - quality data to unde rstand the causal mechanisms associated with poor mental health in order to optimise the effectiveness of psychological interventions for different groups, thereby enabling the development of evidence -informed interventions which can address causes that are thought to be modifiable. Moreover, exploring the coping strategies that have been successfully employed by those with pre -existing mental health conditions during the pandemic has been recommended, in the hope that these can be reinforced and expanded t o improve future resilience. 139,140 Within the literature, there is a consensus that service users and people with live d experience of mental ill -health should be involved centrally in co -developing ethical research and designing inclusive mental health services, as well as in monitoring the quality of these services. 92,139 Moreover, building in user -centred monitoring and evaluation techniques for mental health services should enable interventions to be amended o r terminated if they prove to be ineffective. Regarding service provision, there is a need to facilitate diverse and flexible access to mental health care, with a recognition that community support services or remote therapies may not be appropriate for ev eryone and, therefore, should be considered as an adjunct to mainstream mental health services, but not a replacement. The authors of a position paper on how mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID -19 pandemic, also stress the risks associated with promoting cheap \u2014 but ultimately ineffective \u2014 interventions, as Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 42 this is likely to exacerbate existing inequalities and worsen mental health outcomes globally.92 European Commi ssion Initiatives related to supporting the mental health of essential workers The results of currently funded projects by the European Commission may help to support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers . Such projects, and others, may result in good or best practices that could be transferred to different settings or countries. The EC mechanisms for identifying, sharing and scaling up the results and implications are also in place , primarily via the Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non -Communicable Diseases | Public Health (europa.eu) . The European Commission Directorate -General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) support s a number of initiatives related to sharing good practices in workplace mental health , including the Public Health Best Practice Portal (https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dyna/bp- portal/ ) and stakeholder groups facilitated by the EU Health Policy Platform (https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/hpf/ ). Various Joint Actions and Research and Innovation Actions to improve mental health have been funded and future calls are planned in the Horizon Europe Work Programmes and the new EU4Health Programme . Evidence resulting from these projects is most welcome, and shortcomings in previous literature in evidence -production processes are to be mitigated. 1.4. Cost of mental health problems in the health workforce and the cost - effectiveness of mental health interventions The body of evidence available on the cost -effectiveness of mental health interventions in the workforce has several important limitations . First, compared to other areas of research, there is a considerabl e scarcity of research regarding economic evaluation of mental health interventions. Second, indirect (or societal) costs play an important role, as much of the cost burden is attributable to inability to work rather than costs associated with tr eatment .141 Furthermore, p romoting an d protecting mental health is typically intersectoral (involving actions undertaken by sectors outside the health sector), and this direct non -medical costs play an important role.142 Third, there are challenges with respect to defining and measuring outcome measures. Oft en times only intermediate endpoints can be assessed and may not express the final outcome of symptom/disorder exacerbations, relapses, and recurrences. Because mental health affects many functions and produces many symptoms, it is difficult for the outcom e to encompass all of these impacts. Patient -reported outcome measures (PROMs) are especially relevant, as the objective of interventions to support mental health is primarily to improve individual's physical, mental, and social functioning. Lastly, it is difficult to Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 43 define a mental health \"intervention\" because a single intervention tends to have multiple elements that contribute to its effectiveness. This is even more challenging for complex interventions developed at individual, family, group, organisat ional, community, and societal levels. In conclusion, determining cost -effectiveness of interventions or programmes to support mental health is challenging because the evaluation must go beyond the economic costs and benefits to include social, organisational, and ethi cal impacts.143 Costs of mental health problems in the workforce Even prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, mental health problems caused significant financial impact. In 2013, the total cost of work -related depression alone in the EU -27 was estimated to be \u20ac620 billion per year. The major impact is suffered by employers due to absenteeism and presenteeism (\u20ac270 billion), followed by the econo my in terms of lost output (\u20ac240 billion), the health care systems due to treatment costs (\u20ac60 billion), and the social welfare systems due to disability benefit payments (\u20ac40 billion). 144 Publicly available assessments of monetary costs of mental illness typically report large numbers associated with lost production, reduced performance due to psychosocial problems , future use health and social care services, etc. Cost-effectiveness of work place mental health programmes in general The evidence on cost -effectiveness is even more scarce than the evidence concerning effectiveness, and for some programmes, the costs of the programme exceeded their benefits . Thus, a careful analysis is required b efore starting workplace mental health interventions. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring that the implementation of workplace mental health programmes represents a good use of resources. Some evidence points that w orkplace mental health programmes are more likely to deliver greater returns as they mature, rather than yielding immediate financial benefits . Cost-effectiveness of programmes to support the health workforce and other essential workers No specific cost -effectiveness data for inte rventions or programmes to support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers during the COVID -19 pandemic was identified in the evidence review for this Opinion. Regarding the cost-effectiveness of interventions following crisis situations, such as major incidents of terrorism, a \"screen -and-treat\" approach for Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder in the general population has been examined in England. The approach involves a combination of proactive outreach, screening using validated brief questionnaires , and evidence- based interventions . According 2020 p re-print results, the incremental cost per Quality -Adjusted Life Year (QALY ) gained was \u00a38,297, showing it to be cost -effective. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 44 Although t his finding was in the general population in the context of terrorism , it offers some indication of the expected benefits today of such a programme in implemented in organizations employing essential workers suffering the mental health consequences of the on -going COVID -19 pand emic.145 1.5. What are the conditions for the delivery of these interventions in a cost- effective, affordable and inclusive manner? Delivery conditions are conceptualize d in this opinion using an implementation science framework.146 Implementation science is a field of study that examines the \"research -to- practice gap\" regarding the sustainable uptake of evidence -based practices or innovations. In implementation science research, the study of intervention effectiveness is separated from implementation effectiveness, which typically refers to the strategies developed to disseminate the intervention and address contextual barriers to intervention uptake. Implementation science is a growing field and, in the field of mental health specifically, research on these delivery conditions is lacking.147 Implementation science frameworks are available to help to stru cture the systematic capture of information regarding appropriate delivery conditions.148 What is known in the implementation science literature is that the success of implementation is context dependent. Specifically, a review of contextual factors reported to be associated with implementation of healthcare initiatives found that culture and leadership were identified as strong influenc ing factors for successful implementation.149 Key components were varied and described at individual- , team- or organisational -based contextual factors , external environment and multilevel contextual factors (resources, leadership, management support, culture, evaluation, social capital, learning climate, compatibility, implementation setting) , with team chara cteristics being the least reported, although teams were deemed central to effective care organisation. Leadership was emphasized as quite important, yet examined at the organisational level in only a few studies reviewed. 150 The quality, cost, and equity outcomes of delivery of health -related interventions may be influenced by the organization's capacity (e.g., size and capital assets) , formal and informal organisational struc ture (e.g., leadership , hierarchical structure, governance), finances to pay for the intervention , characteristics of the users (wants, needs, preferences), and culture (shared values, beliefs, assumptions).151 Delivery conditions for the successful implementation of workplace mental health programmes in general Guidance for promoting mental health in the workplace152 offers a number of recommendations in this regard. Employee participation in the design, implementation and evaluation of programmes will improve their e ffectiveness and effici ency. Tailoring Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 45 the programmes to the circumstances of a particular workplace context directly influences the likelihood of effectiveness . Programmes must be evaluate d in real -time, as they happen , and re -assessed and re -orient ed as required. Ethics require special attention in mental health programmes . Confidentiality of inform ation will need to be ensured. Programmes need to be targeted to benefit both employees and employers, and it should be made clear to em ployees that no harm c an come f rom participation. The UK Standard on risk management153 describe s additional principles to be applied when managing psychosocial risks, which are aligned with previous discussion on risk and protective factors and characteristics of interventions, including the role of communication. Specifically with respect to inclusivity, CHRODIS+ Work Package 8 created A Training Tool for Managers to promote inclusiveness and work ability for people with chronic health conditions .154 The CHRODIS+ Toolkit113 provides an illustration of the delivery conditions at multiple levels within an organization to facilitate successful implementation of workplace program mes to support the mental health of essential workers. Conditions for delivery of programmes to support the health workforce and other essential workers Regarding essential workers, and frontline health and social care professionals specifically, one review identified some barriers and facilitators to effective delivery of workplace interventions to support mental health during and after a disease outbreak , epidemic or pandemics (SARS, Ebola, MERS and COVID -19). 98 Two i mportant b arriers to effective implementation were: (1) lack of awareness about the needs and resources of frontline workers , either because they were not aware of their own needs, or because the organizations were not aware of them; and (2) r esource constraints, including lack of equipment, staff time and skills . Three important facilitators of effective implementation were: (1) flexible interventions that were culturally appropriate, adaptable and/or able to be tailored to meet local needs ; (2) effective communic ation and cohesion through horizontal and vertical networks that strengthen social capital and improve d team resilience; and (3) a positive learning climate for everyone involved in implementation of an intervention . Frontline workers' knowledge and bel iefs about the intervention acted as either a barrier or facilitator to implementation , depending on the study. Delivery conditions associated with mental health interventions to support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers The use of the five high -level domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is particularly useful here. 155 These domains are: (1) Intervention characteristics, (2) Implementation Process (such as intervention champions), (3) Characteristics of the individuals involved (such as knowledge and Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 46 beliefs about the in tervention), (4) Inner setting (such as the organizational level characteristics, work culture), and (5) Outer setting (such as external policies and incentives).156 1. Intervention Characteristics The list of categories under this domain include the source of the intervention (internal vs. external), the strength and quality of the evidence supporting it, the relative advantage of using it, its adaptability, its trialability, its design and packaging, and its cost. The EXPH drafting group members placed particular emphasis on a daptability. The intervention must meet user needs and adapt to their evolving needs over time. The intervention must be adaptable to personal factors (e.g., age, family, and socio - economic status ), and occupational factors (e.g., whether the individual is a healthcare worker or other essential worker, nurse vs. doctor, stress level, workload, control/demand job characteristics, and the potential for role switching ) with due consideration for the setting and mode of delivery . The interaction between persona l and occupational risk factors requires consideration. To ensure adaptability and related to the internal source of the intervention, co- design and co -production of intervention was proposed. This would necessitate sound understanding of the needs of targ eted, representative, and inclusive groups of potential intervention users. Furthermore, the drafting group members endorsed statements corresponding to intervention evidence strength and quality and cost, citing the need for more high- quality longitudinal research on the cost -effectiveness of mental health interventions. This requires good monitoring and management systems, constant evaluation of interventions, and a focus on examination of mechanisms as to why an intervention is working. Finally, design and packaging is important. Specifically, emphasis on prevention was preferred over treatment because primary prevention was viewed as more cost -effective in the long -term. The preference for continuous care and intervention was endorsed such that it occur s prior to, during, and after a crisis. Appropriate referral systems must be in place, but peer support groups were highly supported by the EXPH drafting group members (over program mes led by a mental health professional). Building and developing trust amo ng co -workers was viewed as essential. These program mes could be packaged as \"mandatory de -briefs\" or \"preparedness sessions\" to help deal with change. Training should include identification of early working signals of potential mental health deterioration or burnout. Widespread screening systems for mental health issues ought to be instituted and vouchers for follow- on care could be offered. Interventions should be integrated and multi -disciplinary and may include community -based Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 47 intervention (e.g., exerci se, meditation, and arts -based activities). Practicing self - compassion was considered an important intervention component. General occupational safety and health risk assessment in the workplace is a legal obligation of all employers in the EU. The partici patory psychosocial risk assessment should be part of this requirement and used to identify risks to mental health and inform design of an intervention. 2. Implementation Process In the CFIR, categories related to the implementation process of the interve ntion are separated from the intervention itself. These Process categories include planning, executing, reflecting and evaluating, and engaging different stakeholders. The stakeholders range from opinion leaders to formally appointed implementation leaders , to \"champions\" of the intervention on -site, to external change agents, to the innovation participants themselves. The EXPH drafting group members addressed the categories of planning and executing the intervention by describing the importance of building competencies in mental health assessment for occupational health practitioners and managers. They also valued train - the-trainer program mes to ensure sustainability of the intervention. Reflecting on and evaluati ng the intervention and implementation process was seen as an ongoing need, with constant evaluation and collection of feedback from intervention users. This quality assurance / quality control information should then be used to evolve the intervention and its implementation accordingly. A wide rang e of interventions should be offered to meet the needs of all potential users, which supports the Swiss Cheese Model of Intervention. The value of \"champions\" of the intervention was raised . This refers to peers , who had participated in the program me and f ound it beneficial , could help promote it among their colleagues. 3. Characteristics of the Individuals Involved The list of categories under this domain include the knowledge and beliefs about the intervention, self -efficacy, individual stages of change, individual identification with their organization/workplace, and other personal attributes. The EXPH drafting members emphasized the importance of understanding the intervention users potential lack of interest in the intervention (related to stage of change) because of the stigma related to having or admitting mental health issues, especially for the health workforce. Furthermore, their knowledge and beliefs about the intervention regarding mental health as the target and the confidentiality of the data collected during the sessions was also viewed to influence use. The suggestion was made to NOT target those with a history of mental health and/or pre -disposing factors, as this could further alienate the individual from seeking help. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 48 Other personal attribu tes that were identified to influence intervention uptake and/or effectiveness were related to the diversity and heterogeneity of the workforce in terms of profession, culture, language, and ethnicity. Understanding the characteristics of early adopters of an intervention could be leveraged to expand reach, while, at the same time, seeking to understand those who do not want to use existing interventions or resources and why is also important. Cost was considered to be a possible barrier to be considered when planning format, content, and channel of implementation. In addition, to facilitate access to all interested individuals, the timing of the sessions (e.g., time of day, weekday vs. weekend) should be appropriate to the individuals given their commitment s outside of work and availability. Lastly, given the importance of the inner setting of the workplace that will be detailed in the next section, the individual's identification with their organization/workplace was viewed as a critical condition for succe ss delivery of the intervention. Specifically, the individual must feel psychologically safe, trust his/her co -workers, and feel that the organization they work for and its members care about them and value they work they do. Some mental health problems may be caused or aggravated by poor psychosocial work environment that includes excessive time pressure, conflicts, violence, harassment, lack of support, and/or lack of appreciation. Those factors should be identified and addressed, either to prevent their occurrence or to remedy them once present, or both strategies can be worked in parallel. Insufficient intervention in this area may cause workers to be or become resistant and/or have feelings of resentment because they believe they need to 'change', whil e the problems in the work environment remain unchanged. 4. Inner Setting This domain refers to the workplace and its organizational culture. It contains categories such as structural characteristics, networks and communications, culture, implementation cl imate (including tension for change, compatibility, relative priority, organizational incentives and rewards, goals and feedback, and learning climate) and readiness for implementation (including leadership engagement, available resources, and access to kn owledge and information). The EXPH drafting group members felt that, in order to support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers, the most important delivery conditions occurred at this level of management or senior management . Some of the ideas presented previously relate to categories in this domain. For instance, the support shown for peer group support interventions for the health workforce is related closely to networks and communication and issues surrounding stigma about admitting a mental health issue associated with organizational (dis)incentives and rewards. In particular, EXPH drafting group members advocated that there should be no adverse consequences Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 49 for help -seeking behaviour . Incentives could be offered for assum ing extra work during the pandemic, and might include extra pay, fewer night shifts, shorter shift hours, and/or less administrative burden. In addition, performance assessment for managers should include indicators on the wellbeing of their employees. In this way, mental health would be placed on equal footing with other indicators, emphasizing the moral and ethical responsibility they hold with respect to their employees' wellbeing . Most of the interventions proposed by the EXPH drafting group in this dom ain related to effecting changes in organizational culture. For instance, there is a need to shift the mentality from blame on the individual for mental health issues to viewing them as the result of contextual or environmental challenges. The workplace culture must be one of acceptance of the continuum of mental health issues. They suggested that mental health professionals be involved in occupational health activities in the workplace. Drafting group members advocated for the creation of \"flat hierarchies \", such as those in UK magnet hospitals designed to attract and maintain staff. Furthermore, they emphasized the need for fostering a psychologically safe workplace, where staff are comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings. They extended this concept to the creation of a learning climate, where successes and failures can be openly shared and accepted. Factors related to readiness for implementation were widely discussed. Leadership engagement, in the form of top -down intervention from the \"big bos s\" was seen to be one way for the organization to show they care. Leadership engagement in participatory processes with staff and involvement in team cohesion exercises was also valued. Training for managers was one form of access to knowledge and informat ion and considered to be an important available resource. Specific training topics included general leadership, how to conduct risk/needs assessments related to mental health, how to select appropriate interventions to meet those needs, how to value employ ees, and how to empower employees to create meaning in their work. 5. Outer setting The domain refers to the context in which the inner setting operates. It includes categories such as user needs and resources, cosmopolitanism, peer pressure, and external policy and incentives. The majority of the focus group discussion was focused on recommendations for national and EU -level policy to support the mental health and of the health workforce and other essential workers and to support the workplaces and organi zations to intervene within their inner settings to foster cultural changes in line with this goal. This discourse aligns well with the external policy and incentives category. Many themes were well -supported among members of the EXPH drafting group. They advocated for policies that prioritize mental health and wellbeing , to the same extent as cancer, for instance. Guidance for national level mental health plans that focus on the mental health continuum and address diversity and inclusiveness are needed. At the Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 50 same time, acknowledgement that implementation of plans occurs on local and regional levels means that support to lower level implementation groups is critical. They wanted to see an increase in mental health care and support in the community and an i mproved integration of mental health and mental health professionals in to primary care settings. The number of mental health professionals in the public sector should be increased, and professionals in the private sectors utilized in times of crisis. Ment al health should also be integrated into occupational health and even safety to ensure adequate support for the health workforce and other essential workers. This action was believed to enhance compliance to standards. At the same time, the differences in the role of occupational health and the extent of mental health capacity across Member States must be acknowledged and addressed so that no one state is left behind. Regulatory frameworks are needed to ensure clear accountability for staff mental health and wellbeing . Minimum standards entitling each citizen to some basic level of mental health support could be developed. Competencies for mental health practitioners should be developed and then regularly assessed and certified. Mental health trainings for senior management should be mandatory, and training in mental health should be part of health professional curriculums and continuing education program mes. Inter-sectoral collaboration for mental health at the EU -level is warranted. Various Directorate Gen erals can extend EU influence over health. Health can be incorporated into EU economic policies that are part of joint recovery from the pandemic. Sharing of cross-border and inter- regional resources to address surge capacity is also important. Furthermor e, mental health data collection should be standardized across Member States. Regulation is needed to ensure data collection on diversity -related characteristics such as ethnicity and sexual orientation. Mental health data trends of citizens should be tracked and aggregated at EU -level. Enhanced protections, beyond the GDPR, may be required to address issues of confidentiality and privacy in data collection, transfer and storage, especially for digital mental health interventions. In summary, the outer set ting must provide the regulatory and financial structure to support inner setting interventions in the public sectors, companies, SMEs, and workplaces. Financing mechanisms are required, including sustainable support for long-term mental health pr omotion, prevention of mental ill -health, and treatment program mes, research and development of innovative new program mes, de - stigmatization interventions, care re -organization, regulatory frameworks, and data collection and harmonization initiatives. Finally, EU legislation on occupational safety and health (OSH) and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU -OSHA) implies that protection of workers mental health is an integral part of OSH. 157,158 The Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) management system, ISO 45001, is an international standard for health and Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 51 safety a t work . Introduced in March 2018, it provid es a Plan -Do-Check -Act (PDCA) model as a framework to identify OH&S hazards, risks, and opportunities to proactively manage safety, health, and support worker wellness and wellbeing.159 ISO 45003 is a standard due to be released in summer 2021 that will offer organisations practical guidance on how to organise work i n such a way that manages psychosocial risks to staff in the workplace. 160 Occupational risk management is covered under the Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (89/391/EEC) adopted in 1989.161 As additional guidance from the EC regarding this directive suggests,162 concerns and needs regarding psychosocial risk management have e volved and require further legislation. The EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work (2021 -2027) was adopt ed in June, 2021.163 The prior EU OSH Strategic Framework 2014 -2020 had helped to develop support actions and mobilise actors around the key strategic priorities . It is important that implementation reflect s the European policymaking priority on workplace wellbeing and the changing world of work. Specifically, as supported by the European Council, implementation should consider a proposed EU mental health strategy164 and incorporate the Work -life Balance Directive.165 A number of initiatives highlight the need to step up actions to secure an EU Health and Safety Directive on Psychosocial Risks166,167 in the workplace as a means to covering and protecting from the way work is organised (e .g., work pressure, the time pressure, control/influence, monitoring and surveillance, performance management and change , etc.) as well as the social aspects (manageme nt quality, support from management and peers, harassment and violence, bullying). The legal instrument to accomplish these aims should be discussed among EU -level decision - making bodies. Furthermore, the Coalition for Mental Health and Wellbeing in the European Parliament (https://mental -health -coalition.com/ ), established in 2012 by Mental Health Europe, champions for a coordinated response to address workplace mental health and wellbeing through the pillars of both a comprehensive European Mental Health Strategy and by working with member states so that workplace mental health and wellbeing aspects are incorporated into key labour and occupational safety and health policies . 1.6. Recommendations Supporting the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers should be guided by the principles established in the Recommendations below. Each recommendation is further elaborated by Action points that clarify recommended instruments to be used by specific actors to carry out these principles. The level at which Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 52 those instruments are defined can be left open in most cases, as they may take place at local, regional, national or European level. RECOMMENDATION 1: Change f ocus to mental wellbeing Focusing on the positive aspects of mental wellbeing (physical and mental integrity), which is neglected in current evidence dedicated primarily to mental health issues or disorders, is a critical re -conceptualization that must be advanced to support the m ental health of essential workers in a cost -effective manner. Action point 1.1.: Re-conceptualize the discussion into mental wellbeing The primary focus should be on promoting the positive aspects of mental health and how to promote, maintain, or restore them. We will use the terms mental wellbeing and mental health interchangeably. This action point is directed at all decision -makers at all levels and sectors. Policy makers should create this paradigm shift to re -frame/re -direct mental health discussion and foster national policy development and research efforts to align with it. RECOMMENDATION 2: Treat mental wellbeing as a n inherent part of the organisation Mental illness symptoms may manifest in cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and/or physical (or bodily/somatic) ways. Symptoms are subjective in nature. Understanding of mental health and mental illness lags far behind our understanding of physical health. Assessment of positive mental health is even more challenging, requiring explicit efforts at this moment. Organisations (health care providers, providers of essential services) should treat the provision of adequate environment for promotion of mental wellbeing of workers as major occupational safety dimension, including a psychologically safe environment. Organisations should be able to routinely detect \"warning signals\" for loss of mental wellbeing in workers and, eventually, the emergence of mental health issues and disease that need help from a health professional. The term \"organisations\" covers health care providers and providers of essential services. It includes government bodies and units, private for -profit companies, non - profit companies, charities, etc. Action point 2.1: Have a mental wellbeing plan Organisation s should have a plan to address mental wellbeing of workers. This plan needs to support the entire spectrum of mental health (from promotion of protecting factors to sensitivity and timely action to \"warning signals\" at individual level as well as changing workplace hazards that may cause psychological harm to workers). This action point is directed at senior managers of all organisations with a high share of essential workers. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 53 It is important for organisat ions to develop a process to detect \"warning signal s\". These signals would lead to a more in -depth mental health assessment and eventually diagnosis and treatment of mental illness or mental health promotion and prevention activities . Warning signals are to be produced at the organisation level, while ment al health assessment is performed at the individual level. This r equires that assessment tools are in place, preferably keeping the individual process confidential. On this, the use of digital tools, by introducing distance between who is assessed and the organisation, creates a psychologically safe space that can be helpful to reduce the stigma and visibility to others of the assessment. Organisations should establish monitoring and reporting of indicators reflecting on wellbeing (positive mental health) a s well as problems in organisational culture/ workload etc, and act on them. These indicators should be selected from a set of indicators to be made available at EU -level to ensure the same principles are applied uniformly, allowing for comparability and relative evolution. Action point 2.2: Report on mental wellbeing Organisations are to report, in a transparent way, on the internal mental wellbeing environment, using common indicators (see Recommendation 3). Organisations are to keep the detailed result s of these indicators confidential but provide mechanisms to ensure to an outside inspectorate that the system is being used. This action point complements action point 1.1. It is directed to senior managers of organisations with a high share of essential workers (on the reporting duty) and to Government officials in the health sector (on the monitoring of this report by each organisation ). The involvement of Government officials may be minimal, for instance to check that the report is publicly available. P enalties may apply if organisations do not report, though , as a first step, a positive acknowledgement of these reports is preferred as an incentive mechanism for adherence). Action point 2.3: Identify workplace hazards to mental wellbeing Develop and imp rove protocols and standards for organisations to identify workplace hazards to mental wellbeing so that they are managed in a manner consistent with other occupational health and safety risks . This can build on the experience of the European Agency for Sa fety and Health at Work. This action point is directed for those responsible for health policies, both at national and EU level. Coordination at EU- level is desirable to ensure consistent practice. National implementation will adjust b etter to local cultur e. Organisations should be made aware of the relevance of changing internal culture and have the corresponding tools/approaches/instruments for effective handling of mental wellbeing of workers in place. Organizations could evaluate the risk for negative w ork- related mental health consequences. Organizations should provide psychologically safe environment and provide positive support to individuals with pre -existing mental health Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 54 conditions and in collaboration with the individual and a multidisciplinary oc cupational medicine team develop a specific plan to mitigate stressors at individual level. Action point 2.4: Ensure that organisations of all sizes participate This may require providing tools to the organisations that are too small to develop their own s olutions. The use of digital tools is promising. This action point is mainly directed at EU-level decision makers in a first step. There are obvious gains from avoiding duplication of work. National language implementation should be taken by national decision makers. This bridges health, employment and digital areas of public policy. At the country or regional level, the appropriate public entity should provide digital tools or other appropriate widely deployable solutions for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs ) and organisations to have a minimum level wellbeing plan of workers in place. These tools are at level of the organisation and they are not individual intervention tools. It may be helpful to design a digital tool at EU -level to help small and mediu m organisations to adhere to the tools with minimum cost. Large organisations need to ensure interoperability of their own tools and information systems with this EU -level digital tool. Action point 2.5: Create a Chart er of Rights to Wellbeing at the Work place Create an EU -level norm, Chart er of Rights to Wellbeing at the Workplace (or some other name) to set a norm, with observable elements for public opinion, that organisations will treat employees well. This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers. This Chart er of Rights would provide transparency and include accountability to care for employees' health as part of its effects. The elaboration of the Chart er of Rights to Wellbeing at the Workplace should make explicit reference to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, to the European Pillar of Social Rights and to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. RECOMMENDATION 3 : Create a supportive environment at EU -level There is a clear need for policy developments to embed workplace mental healt h interventions geared towards the promotion, prevention, and support of mental health at work and the management of work -related psychosocial risks. This has been endorsed by the European Council in its conclusions on Enhancing Wellbeing at Work. The document also invites Member States and the European Commission, in accordance with their respective competences and taking into account national circumstances, whilst respecting the role and autonomy of the social partners, to include the perspective of wellbeing at work horizontally into relevant national and Union policies . In this respect, in the context of the EU Strategic Framework for Health and Safety at Work (2021 - 2027) 161, the European Commission has agreed to launch an \"EU -OSHA healthy workplaces campaign\" 2023 -2025 on creating a safe and healthy digital future that Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 55 will cover psychosocial risks in particular . The Commission will prepare a non -legislative EU-level initiative related to mental health at work, in cooperation with Member States and social partners. Furthermore, it will develop the analytical basis, e -tools and guidance for risk assessments related to green and digi tal jobs and processes, including in particular psychosocial risks. In addition, it calls on Member States to host 'peer reviews' addressing occupational psychosocial issues. Finally, the Commission invites social partners to take action and update existing agreements at cross -industry and sectoral level to address new OSH issues related to the digital labour market, particularly psychosocial risks, by 2023. We expect that mental wellbeing will be addressed through these and other initiatives. Action point 3.1: Protect mental wellbeing in labour market legislation Include mental wellbeing and mental health protection as part of legislation changes addressing employment conditions and social protection. This action point is directed at national decision makers responsible for public policy regarding employment and workplace conditions. The mental wellbeing and mental health of the health workforce and essential workers needs to be addressed by workplace general conditions, and as such supportive interventions outside the health care sector, and related to labour market conditions, are required. Action point 3.2: Set an EU -level mechanism to measure wellbeing of workers An EU -level entity should publish a set of indicators on mental wellbeing, defined at the organisation level. The information should include definition of wellbeing, each indicator and how to compute them with the least possible cost to organisations, small and large. This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers. The definitions need to ensure that data collection and indicator computation cover the same dimensions and have the same meaning everywhere. These indicators should include Mental Health Person Reported Outcome Measures with a clear definition, t o make information comparable over time and (eventually) over organisations. The possibility to set research funding at EU level for explicit work on the development of the measures to be adopted is to be considered. There is currently a wealth of inform ation in some countries that can be translated to other languages. Some new measures may have to be created. Providing a common set of concepts and ensuring they are understood in the same way everywhere is a necessary step. A review of existing indicators , their breadth of scope, common understanding and their usefulness should be done. Action point 3.3: Develop reliable screening tools Self-assessment and organisational assessment tools are needed. These should be tools that the people may use for themsel ves to assess their personal mental wellbeing status Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 56 and, in p articular, the resulting degree of functional impairment . The tools would include clear messages on how to strengthen positive mental health and identify when and where to seek the help. This ac tion point is directed at those responsible for health policies at national level, though a coordination role to ensure consistency and comparability across geographies is desirable. Action point 3.4: Ensure accountability Clearly define, at each decision level, EU and national/regional, who owns the role of promoting and monitoring mental wellbeing initiatives . It can be either a new entity or an entity that already oversees workplace conditions and employment contracts resolution (for example). This actio n point is directed at EU and at national decision makers in the area of health and employment policies. Different countries may decide for different solutions that ensure similar final outcomes regarding accountability. Action point 3.5: Provide guidance on \"mentally protective\" workplaces Build an EU-level handbook on how to prepare a \"mentally protective\" workplace, and update it regularly (every two years, at least) b ased on the latest evidence. N ational and regional specific elements may be recognised , added by national entities of Member States. This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers. This handbook should help organisations to have a good internal process without being too normative (or trying to micromanage every single organisation, which would certainly fail). It should cover from definition to communication and to implementation. It should help organisations to strengthen and/or develop processes to support positive mental health, and avoid internal stigma and discrimination associated with mental issues. It should help in building a supportive environment and building on eliminating harassment (and gender -based harassment) in the workplace. Gender harassment in the workplace should be treated as one organisational dimension of promotion of mental wellbeing. Action point 3.6: Continue to p romote and strengthen further EC and Member States collaboration Support from the EC to those - existing or future - initiatives of collaboration between countries regarding the mental health of healthcare workers or essen tial workers in general, such as the \"Practitioners Health Provider Network\" , is desirable. This action point is directed at the EC decision makers. RECOMMENDATION 4: Create an appropriate cost -effectiveness methodology Cost-effectiveness of interventions in mental health are mostly inconclusive and most have methodological limitations to the generalisation of results. Cost -effectiveness needs only t o be explicitly considered for interventions involving public funding or public decisions over use of resources. If outcomes to be met are defined, organisations will do Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 57 their internal assessment on the best way to reach them (they will do their own internal cost-effectiveness analysis, even if not formally being named that way). Cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions in mental health are particularly difficult to perform due to the time horizon of those interventions (outcomes may take years to materialise) and due to the difficulty in establishing a precise causal link from intervention to mental health outcome (interventions are often tailor made to each individual, based on unobservable factors, such as organisation culture, peer support, empathy with health care provider and trust in the relationship by the patient). Also, the perspective adopted in cost - effectiveness analysis has to recognise the existence of spillover effects from mental health interventions outside the health sector. Thus, the societal perspective is enlarged and the payer perspective (public sector - national health service - in some countries) is too narrow to account for all relevant benefits. In particular, considering the impact on the labour market of a mental -health rela ted intervention, the common use of measures such as Quality -Adjusted Life Years may not be adequate. The general presumption obtained from existing studies and meta -analysis is that prevention interventions are generally cost -effective compared to non -prevention. Action point 4.1 Set a specific research program me The objective is to develop a specific methodology of cost -effectiveness (cost -benefit) analysis of mental health interventions at all levels, having in mind all the specifics of the interventions, and that accounts for person- specific treatment plan (recognise that every treatment is different versus the standardised nature of other health interventions) and the long -time horizon of interventions (time to benefits manifestation). This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers in both areas of health and scient ific research. Economic evaluation should be promoted in the field of mental health. Literature is very scarce on this issue, probably for good reasons of data availability and the challenges outlined above. It is necessary to recognise , in methodologies used and in decisions, that many interventions that may not be cost effective for the organisation may be so for society . Public decisions may require a cost -effectiveness analysis to back them even if there is little or no public funding involved. RECOMME NDATION 5: Build and share knowledge on interventions, further developing current initiatives Build robust evidence -based knowledge on interventions and mental wellbeing program mes to take place at organisations. The knowledge base must result from a Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 58 careful critical assessment and emphasis should be placed on patient values being included in the assessment. Those responsible for developing intervention program mes should utilize a \"swiss cheese\" approach in which complex evidence -based interventions are use d to address a complex issue. A combination of interventions addressing different protective and risk factors and targeting different vulnerable and non -vulnerable groups at different levels (individual, organizational, community, societal) can help ensure comprehensive coverage so that \"no- one is left behind\" or \"falls through the cracks\" (holes). Action point 5.1: Promote research Provide research funding to help build a high -quality knowledge base, filling the gaps in current research results. This ac tion point is directed to both EU -level and national decision makers in health and employment (workplace safety) policies. The effort to build a knowledge base must focus research on protective factors that may help ensure quick and effective recovery after exposure to stress (harm -reduction approach), protect against adverse mental health outcomes prior to stress (protection approach), and/or promote positive aspects of mental wellbeing. They may be highly context/culturally dependent and may change over t ime. Potentially identify them not at individual level but for specific group of people, such as specific group of (essential) workers. Research to produce evidence needs to be able to provide an understanding of what matters, how it matters and how much i t matters. Develop evidence on interventions on how people work in teams, to mutually support positive mental wellbeing (peer -support). It needs to ensure that the evidence- based body of knowledge includes a) outcomes at individual, organisation and population levels, b) detailed analysis of vulnerable groups; c) information on actual use of tools made available by interventions. There is a need to develop survey tools that better distinguish mental illness from distress and measure the types of difficulties that need intervention. The activation of this recommendation must deve lop and promote use of mixed approaches (qualitative and quant itative) in both implementation and evaluation of mental health programs and interventions, having clear targets at the organization level. It is also appropriate to predict adequate funding for pilot innovative mental wellbeing programs and interventions, with well- prepared evaluations, in order to build an evidence- based body of knowledge regarding effective interventions and prevention strategies. This can be done at national and/or at EU- level. Action point 5. 2: Build conditions for effective interventi ons Create and foster the conditions for innovative and effective interventions and mental wellbeing program mes to take place at organisations. Promote comprehensive interventions with the involvement of management structure, primary healthcare and Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 59 communi ty stakeholders. This action point is directed at national decision -makers responsible for health and employment. RECOMMENDATION 6: Having a shared EU -wide view of mental health care Continue to b uild a harmonised view, across Member States, of mental well being promotion and of basic mental health care for individuals with mental illnesses . There is need to ensure that all member states share common values that support mental wellbeing promotion and adequate and timely access to health professionals when needed by the health workforce and essential workers. This also means a more general support to the change process to community mental health services (more advanced in some countries than in others). EU-level action should continue to help M ember States and regions to learn from each other on effective best practices. Support and develop further a EU- level \"learning community\" for exchange of 'best practice s' on increasing mental health resilience on healthcare workers and other essential workers. Promote learning in action, involving learning through engagement. This effort should involve regional authorities (governance bodies), local administrative bodies (municipalities) and other local authorities in order to explore joint actions and strengthen community coalitions and supportive synergies. It should also promote actions for a better exchange of proposal and ideas between European scientific societies and those that represent occupational medicine, mental health practitioners, public health, general practice and primary care, and other clinical and non -clinical disciplines (including psychology, social work, anthropology, among others). Action point 6.1: Take actions to implement and create demonstrable effect At EU -level, identify low -cost but effective interventions that can be implemented quickly by member states that find themselves with limited capacity to provide mental health services. This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers in health and employment. As a complementary effort on the building of a general EU view, a useful tool can be a EU seal of excellence for mental wellbeing protection. RECOMMENDATION 7: Prepare organisations and their leaders Mental health and work -related psychosocial risks need to be firmly embedded into corporate risk management and business operations. Action point 7.1: Improve leadership Train leaders of health care organisations on fostering positive mental wellbeing in their organisations and long -term thinking (instead of short -term emergency reactions). This action point is directed to national decision makers, covering health, employm ent and education (higher education in particular) policies. Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 60 Action point 7.2: Prepare for the job Provide guidance and training on how healthcare organisations can actively \"prepare staff for the job\". Guidance should be provided on identification of the moment to do it, and on what should be said and how. Address explicitly how organisations anticipate and prepare on burnout, moral injury, post -traumatic stress disorder and depression. This action point is directed at national decision makers. Action point 7.3: Provide support in emergency situations Prepare mechanisms to activate support in emergency situations to the health workforce and essential workers. This action point is directed at national decision makers and senior managers of organisations with high shares of essential workers, to collaborate on the identification and definition of best practices. Define mechanisms by which psychological support can be given during a crisis, and is known in advance that will be available. Those mechanisms need t o account for different needs and capacities of small and large organisations to cope with demand . Moreover, those mechanisms need to account for the specific risks that frontline workers face. Also, define mechanisms by which professional support can be given during a crisis, and is known in advance that will be available. Those mechanisms should include, according to evidence, helplines and consultation from trained professionals. Finally, define mechanisms by which support to family life of essential wor kers can be given during a crisis and is known in advance that will be available. The support can include free transportation, accommodation and childcare. Provide stress management training to essential workers. This recommendation can be associated with a certification. Other possible ways to operationalise this recommendation include promot ing the development and use of occupational (digital) mental health interventions, as well as redirecting to health care services when appropriate , and activat ing leadership to be aware of early warnings . To ensure that timely and adequate action takes place , focus on: (i) organisation changes, to eliminate workplace hazards detrimental to mental health, (ii) at the individual level, an appropriate and timely channelli ng to healthcare/diagnosis takes place if needed. Organisations can review and build upon existing toolkits. As an example, the CHRODIS toolkit has helpful recommendations that are easy to implement, and low cost actions. Action point 7.4: Train for the l ong term Human resources management training and curricula should develop explicit mention and work with mental wellbeing of workers. Continuous professional development should incorporate mental wellbeing concerns. Responding to mental illness requires a structure different to that of addressing conditions for safe mental wellbeing. Improve and develop mental health literacy in organisations by educati ng (all) professionals/workers. This Supporting mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 61 action point is directed at n ational decisions makers in the education sector. Collaboration from policy makers from the health sector is necessary. RECOMMENDATION 8: Provide timely and adequate access to care Mental illness needs to be addressed within the health and social care sys tem, after proper diagnosis is made. Action point 8.1: Communicate properly within the health system Ensure that adequate communication from organisations to health care services exist, so that diagnosis and (eventually) treatment takes place. Communicati on should be done in a way that avoids stigma and it is compliant with data protection (as detailed in the GDPR). This action point is directed at senior managers of organisations with high shares of essential workers. Action point 8.2: Develop new solutio ns Develop the profile/role of 'primary care community psychologist', that works at societal, organisational and individual level. This action point is directed at national decision makers in health policies. International coordination is necessary to ensu re consistency of solutions across the EU. In conclusion, even prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, the case for effectively managing psychosocial risks was already clear. The EU, Member States and organisations should regard mental health and wellbeing at work as part of a holistic approach to health and safety that also considers psychosocial risks. Leadership for change is required at all levels - from EU decision makers, to nati onal policy regulators, to s enior management in organisations, to mental health practitioners and occupational health practitioners .
