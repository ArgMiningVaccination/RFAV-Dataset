The aim of this study was to provide an overview of evidence for improved outcomes by natural medi- cines. A systematic literature search was performed through Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane until May 2015. In 110 randomized controlled trials, evidence was found for glycine, sarcosine, N-acetylcysteine, some Chinese and ayurvedic vitamin B6 added to antipsychotics. biloba B6 seemed to reduce tardive dyskinesia and akathisia. Results on other compounds were negative or inconclusive. All natural agents, except reserpine, were well tolerated. Most study samples were small, study periods were generally short, and most results need replication. However, there is some evidence for beneficial effects of certain natural medicines. Key Words: Psychosis, natural products, complementary medicine (JN e r vM e n tD i s 2018;206: 81 -101) Despite much progress in treatment options in the last century, the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders is often unsatis- factory, as expressed in persistent positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms, and problems in social functioning (Kane and Correll, 2010). Psychotic symptoms are often only partially resolved (Rummel-Kluge et al., 2010), especially cognitive and negative symptoms (Buckley and Stahl, 2007). Apart from clozapine, second-generation antipsychotics are generally as effective as first-generation antipsychotics for positive symptoms, but the promise of greater efficacy for negative symptoms has not been fulfilled (Leucht et al., 2012). Many patients continue experiencing persistent symptoms and relapses during treatment with antipsychotics, particularly when they fail to adhere to prescribed medications (Van Os and Kapur, 2009) . Psychiatric medication adherence is a problem because many patients do not want them or consider them unnecessary (Cooper et al., 2007), or experience undesired adverse effects (Pai and Vella, 2012). For antipsychotics, these adverse effects include weight gain, sexual dysfunction, glycemic and lipid dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and sedation (Stahl, 2008). Many patients with psychotic disorders use nonconventional medicines or treatments in the hope of decreasing undesired adverseeffects or a more successful recovery (Hazra et al., 2010; Stevinson, 2001). Nonconventional medicine includes therapeutic lifestyle changes and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) (Hoenders, 2013). Complementary medicine comprises diagnostics, treatments, and pre- vention strategies based on theories accepted in biomedicine and substan- tiated by some scientific evidence (two or more randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), but for various (cultural or practical) reasons are no part of biomedicine (Hoenders et al., 2011). A lternative medicine comprises diagnostics, treatments, and prevention strategies using other than the ba- sic concepts of biomedicine. So far, ther e is little proof for the efficacy of the latter treatments and/or consider able controversy about their scientific validation (Lake, 2007). Natural medi cine is part of complementary med- icine, using agents produced by living organisms (plant, tree, seed, vege- table, fruit, animal, and human) instead of nonnatural ( i.e., chemical) agents only being obtained from laboratory experiments (Porter, 1998). Some patients prefer natural medici nes, assuming that natural is better and will cause fewer adverse effects. This is obviously not (always) true, as the natural environment contai ns agents that can be toxic to humans. The molecular structure and dosage of a substance rather than its source determine its effect on human health (Topliss et al., 2002). Besides, herbal medicines can cause undesired effects including interactions with prescription medication (Ernst, 2003a, 2003b). Hazra et al. (2010) reported a lifetime and 1-year prevalence rate of CAM use in Canadian psychotic outpatients of 88% and 68%, re- spectively. A major difficulty these patients encounter is the heteroge- neity in treatment options with CAM, ranging from possibly interesting agents to useless, or even dangerous, ones (Ernst, 2003b). For instance, the concomitant use of antipsychotics and Chinese herbs was found to induce significantly improved clinical outcomes com- pared with antipsychotics only (Rathbone et al., 2007). However, a small but significant number of patients concomitantly treated with Chinese herbs have a greater risk of developing worse outcomes (Zhang et al., 2011b). In recent years, patients' preferences and views have received more attention in making treatment choices ( e.g., shared decision mak- ing [Elwyn et al., 2000] and \"patient-centered care \"[Gill, 2013]). The introduction of patient's choice in deciding which antipsychotic to choose has been proposed (Morrison et al., 2012). However, it is diffi- cult for both patients and physicians to make informed decisions in the absence of reliable information on the emerging evidence for CAM or natural medicine. Considering its high usage in psychotic patients, there is an urgent need for readily available scientific information. This article reviews the literature on the efficacy and safety of natural medicines for psychotic disorders.

Second, two authors (H.J.R.H. and A.A.B.V .) indepen- the abstracts \u2014should (pos- sibly) be included. Consultation followed about dubious cases and incase of discordance. Thereupon, 427 studies remained, of which the fullpapers on RCTs were retrieved and studied. Of these, another 160 were excluded. A flowchart of the study selection is presented in Figure 1. We found 147 reviews and checked whether RCTs in their referencelists matching our inclusion criteria were included. Eight RCTs with a Jadad score of 3 or higher (see paragraph on risk of bias assessment and Table 2) found through cross-references were added. Eighteen RCTs wereexcluded because of a Jadad score less than 3. The reviews (not shownin Table 3) will be contrasted to our findings in the Discussion section. Classification of Agents The RCTs included were divided into six groups based on sup- posed underlying mechanisms of action (Table 3). For a good graspof the results, we briefly present the working mechanisms of theagents from five groups (not from the group \"other substances \"). (i) Omega-3 fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential for brain functioning (Tsalamanios et al., 2006). They havemultiple important biological roles, including membrane functioning, neurotransmission, signal transduction, and eicosanoid synthesis. Re- search suggests that PUFA level reduction is related to schizophrenia(Berger et al., 2006). Concordant with these findings, omega-3 PUFAmay have positive effects in the treatment of schizophrenia (Emsley et al., 2002; Peet, 2008). (ii) Glutamate. Besides dopamine, glutamate is thought to play a role in schizophrenia (Tsai and Lin, 2010). On the basis of the hypoth-esis that the glutamatergic system may be compromised in schizophre- nia, the use of N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulators may compensate for alterations in the glutamate system (Singh and Singh,2011). Agents with coagonistic properties source of glycine). The transporter-1 (GlyT-1) plays a pivotal role inmaintaining glycine concentration within synapses at a subsaturating is a GlyT -1 inhibitor, meaning that itspresence results in increased glycine concentrations. Lower cerebral glycine levels are suggested to be found in patients with schizophrenia. The administration of sarcosine is therefore proposed to relieve symp-toms of schizophrenia when added to nonclozapine antipsychotics(Lane et al., 2006). Whereas the mechanisms of NAC are now begin- ning to be understood, NAC is probably exerting benefits beyond being a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, also modulating glutamater-gic, neurotropic, and inflammatory pathways (Dean et al., 2011). (iii) Eastern (Chinese and ayurvedic) herbs. Eastern herbs are provided in the context of treatment with complete systems of medicine that evolved over thousands of years, such as TCM andAyurveda. These treatments include prescription of herbal com- pounds, massage, diet, acupuncture, and the regulation of lifestyle (Clifford, 1994; Kaptchuck, 2000). Most clinical studies were per-formed on acupuncture (beyond the scope of this review) and onherbal compounds. (iv) B vitamins. Nobel laureate Linus Pauling proposed a way of understanding and treating psychiatric disorders by correctingmalfunctions in the body's chemistry, calling this approach \"orthomo- lecular psychiatry \"(Pauling, 1968). His idea was partly built on studies by Osmond and Hoffer (1962) and Hoffer and Osmond (1964), reporting good results when treating patients with schizophrenia withlarge doses of vitamins, especially vitamin B3. Hoffer (1971, 1972)published two more positive results with B vitamins. However, attempts to replicate his findings seem to have failed (Ban and Lehmann, 1975; Wittkopp and Abuzzahab, 1972). The contradicting findings may beexplained because vitamine B is suggested to be effective in early psy- chosis but not in chronic schizophrenia (Hoffer and Osmond, 1964). One of the proposed mechanisms is abnormal one-carbon metabolismdue to vitamin deficiencies (Hoffer, 2008). Variable levels of the com-ponents of one-carbon metabolism (folic acid [= vitamin B9] and vita- min B12) and consequently altered levels of homocysteine and phospholipid DHA have been reported both in medicated patients andin medication-naive first-episode psychotic patients (Kale et al.,2010). Folate status in patients with schizophrenia correlates inversely with negative symptoms (Goff et al., 2005). (v) Antioxidants. Oxygen is essential in life but also generates re- active molecules (so-called free radicals) throughout the body. These free radicals are potentially harmful because they can damage essential molecules such as DNA and the enzymes necessary for proper cellfunctioning. Antioxidants may capture these reactive free radicals andconvert them back to less reactive forms of the molecules (Singh TABLE 2.

Research suggests that oxidative damage (maybe due to defective enzyme systems) may contribute to the course and outcomeof schizophrenia (Fendri et al., 2006; Mahadik and Mukherjee, 1996; Mahadik et al., 2001) and is already present in patients with first- episode psychosis (Flatow et al., 2013). Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an antioxidant vitamin, plays an im- portant role in protecting free radical-induced damage in the body. It is present in brain tissue and dopamine-dominant areas in higher con- centrations compared with other organs (Harrison and May, 2009).Ginkgo biloba, an extract of the leaves of the ginkgo biloba tree, isalso suggested to have antioxidant properties (Maclennan et al., 2002), improving brain circulation at the microvascular level (Kuboto et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2003; Y an et al., 2008) and, thus, improvingoutcome in psychosis. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics is associated with a va- riety of movement disorders, and oxidative stress-induced neuro-toxicity in the nigrostriatal system are suggested to be involved in its pathogenesis (Kulkarni and Naidu, 2003). The pineal hormone melato- nin a potent antioxidant and attenuates dopaminergic activity in thestriatum and dopamine release from the hypothalamus (Shamiret al., 2001). Thus, treatment with antioxidative agents may have a beneficial effect for both treatment of psychotic symptoms and pre- vention of TD. Vitamin E has been suggested for TD because it is alipid-soluble antioxidant that decreases free radical formation(Herrera and Barbas, 2001). Risk of Bias Assessment Two assessors (A.A.B.V . and N.K.V .) independently rated the of the eligible RCTs using the Jadad scale(Jadad et al., 1996). Interrater agreement on the Jadad beforeconsensus discussion amounted to 0.83. Besides, H.J.R.H. indepen- dently rated a random selection of 17 papers (15%) from the selected RCTs. Interrater agreement of all three assessors was 0.71. Any scoringdisagreements between the assessors were resolved through consensusdiscussion between these three authors. The 110 RCTs with a Jadad score of 3 or higher were included in the current review, categorized into six groups (see the Classification of agents section). For each of the 110 studies fulfilling the selection criteria, the following assessments were made: which natural agent was used; was this combined with antipsychotics, and if so, which antipsychotics andwhat dosage; the effect of the natural agent on negative, positive, cognitive,depressive, and general symptoms and on adverse effects of antipsychotics; possible adverse effects of the natural agent; number of participants in the study; control group characteristics; number of dropouts; study duration;and Jadad score. The results are shown in Table 3. Results In total, 110 RCTs that matched the inclusion criteria were identi- fied. Detailed effects are given in Table 3. Most of the studies were per-formed in the United States, follow ed by (in decreasing order) Israel, Canada, Taiwan, China, India, United Kingdom, Australia, Iran, South Africa, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Korea, and Norway. (i) Omega-3 Fatty Acids E l e v e nR C T so no m e g a - 3w e r ei n c l u d e d( B e n t s e ne ta l . , 2013; Berger et al., 2007; Fentonet 2010; Vaddadi et al., 1989), and one combined omega-3 with vitamins E and C (Bentsen et al., 2013). Instudies combining antipsychotics with omega-3 PUFA, one (from five)study on negative symptoms in schizophrenia found some positive ef- fect (in patients using clozapine; Peet and Ho rrobin, 2002), two (from four) found some positive effect on positive symptoms (Peet et al.,2001; Peet and Horrobin, 2002; using clozapine [Peet and Horrobin, 2002]), one (from two) on cognitive symptoms(Vaddadi et al., 1989), none (from three) on depressive symptoms, and four (from eight) on general psychopathology (Emsley et al., patients using clozapine [Peet and Horrobin,2002]). One (from one) study on omega- 3 PUFA without antipsychotics reported a decrease of positive symptoms (Peet et al., 2001). Three (from six) reported less adverse effects of antipsychotics (EPS and/ordyskinesia) (Berger et al., 2007; Emsley et al., 2002; Vaddadi et al.,1989). Two studies reported less use of antipsychotics in the omega-3 PUFA group (Berger et al., 2007; Peet et al., 2001). One study reported an increase in positive symptoms by omega-3 (EPA), butonly among those with low levels of red blood cell PUFA. This effect disappeared when EP A was combined with vitamin E and vitamin C (Bentsen et al., 2013). Some nonsevere adverse effects of omega-3PUFA were reported, such as mild gastrointestinal problems andincreased bleeding time. (ii) Glutamate Nine RCTs on glycine (Buchanan et al., 2007; Diaz et al., 2005; Evins et al., 2000; al., 1996, al., 1999; Javitt et al., 1994, 2001; Potkin et al., 1999), eight on D-serine (D'Souza et 2013; Ermilov et al., 2013; Heresco-Levy et al., 2005; Lane et al., 2005, 2010; Tsai et al., 1998, 1999; Weiseret al., 2012), ten on D-cycloserine (Buchanan et al., 2007; Cain et al., 2014; Duncan et al., 2004; Goff et al., 2005, 2008; Gottlieb et al., 2011; Heresco-Levy et al., al., 1996; Van al., 1999; Yurgelun-Todd et al., 2005), one on D-alanine (Tsai et al., 2006), five on sarcosine (Lane et al., 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010; Tsai et al., 2004), and two on NAC (Berk et al., 2008; Lavoie et al., 2008)were included. G l y c i n ei m p r o v e dn e g a t i v es y m p t o m sw h e nc o m b i n e dw i t ha n - tipsychotics in six (from seven) studies (Buchanan et al., 2007; Heresco et al., 1996, 2004; Heresco-Levy et al., 1999; Javitt et al., 1994, 2001),but not when combined with clozapine (two studies) (Potkin et al.,1999; Evins et al., 2000). Positive symptoms improved in one study (Heresco et al., 2004), worsened in another (with clozapine) (Potkin et al., 1999), and did not change in fi ve (from seven) studies (Diaz et al., 2005; Evins et al., 2000; Heresco al.,1999; Javitt et al., 1994); cognitive improvement was shown in four (Heresco et al., 1996, 2004; Heresco-Levy et al., 1999; Heresco et al., 2004; Javitt et al., 2001) and no change in two (from seven) studies(Buchanan et al., 2007; Evins et al., 2000); depressive symptoms diminished in four (from four) studies (Heresco et al., 1996, 2004; Heresco-Levy et al., 1999; Javitt et al., 2001); and general psychopathology was shown in three (from eight)studies (Heresco et al., 1996, 2004; Heresco-Levy et al., 1999). No adverse effects of glycine were reported, except some mild gastrointestinal complaints. D-Serine was shown to improve positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms and general psychopathology in two (from six) studies when added to antipsychotics (Heresco-Levy et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 1998). The three largest studies with the highest Jadad score did not show a sig-n i f i c a n te f f e c to f D-serine on any symptom (Lane et al., 2005; Lane et al., 2010; Weiser et al., 2012). In four (from six) studies, D-serine did not improve adverse effects of antipsychotics (Lane et al., 2005,2010; Tsai et al., 1998, 1999). Insomnia, weight gain, palpitations,and other adverse effects of D-serine were reported. One study found improvement by D-serine without antipsychotics, but this was signifi- cantly less compared with the improvement in the olanzapine group;D-serine, however, caused less adverse effects (Ermilov et al., 2013). D-Cycloserine showed an improvement of negative symptoms in three (from nine) studies when added to antipsychotics (Goff et al., 2008; Heresco-Levy et al., 2002; Yurgelun-Todd et al., 2005); someThe Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease \u0081Volume 206, Number 2, February 2018 Natural Medicines for Psychosis \u00a9 2018 W olters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. www.jonmd.com 93improvement of positive symptoms in one (Gottlieb et al., 2011) and worsening in another study (from seven) (Van Berckel et al., 1999);and little or no effect on cognitive and depressive symptoms or general psychopathology and no improvement of adverse effects of antipsychotics was shown. Five (from five) studies found no improvement ofadverse effects of antipsychotics (Buchanan et al., 2007; Duncanet al., 2004; Goff et al., 2005; Heresco-Levy et al., 2002; Van Berckel et al., 1999). No studies were reported on D-cycloserine without antipsychotics. No adverse effects of D-cycloserine were reported. The only study on D-alanine reported positive effects when added to antipsychotics on negative, positive, cognitive, and general symptoms, but no effect on depressive symptoms (Tsai et al., 2006). No effect on adverse effects of antipsychotics was found. Adverse ef-fects of D-alanine (insomnia and nausea) were reported. All three studies combining sarcosine with antipsychotics (not clozapine) found positive effects in almost all symptom domains(Lane et al., 2005, 2010; Tsai et al., 2004). When combined with cloza-pine (one study), no treatment effects were found (Lane et al., 2006). In addition, when given without antipsychotics (one study), sarcosine did not improve symptoms (Lane et al., 2008). Sarcosine did not improveadverse effects of antipsychotics in four (from four) studies (Laneet al., 2005, 2006, 2010; Tsai et al., 2004). Adverse effects of sarcosine included weight gain, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, and sedation. One large study on NAC added to antipsychotics reported im- proved positive symptoms but no improvement of negative, cognitive,or general symptoms and no improvement of adverse effects of antipsy- chotics (Berk et al., 2008), whereas one small study found some im- provement of cognitive symptoms (Lavoie et al., 2008). The largestudy (Berk et al., 2008) reported that there were no adverse effects, and in the small study (Lavoie et al., 2008), occurrence of any adverse effect was not mentioned. (iii) Eastern (Chinese and Ayurvedic) Herbs Many studies on Eastern herbs were found, but only six had a Jadad score of three or higher (Chen et al., 2008a, 2009; Mahalet al., 1976; old study onreserpine found \"clinical improvement \"after 11 weeks compared with placebo in 80 patients not treated with antipsychotics but with electroconvulsice therapy (Naidoo, 1956). Several edema, diarrhea, epigastric pain,salivating, pseudo-Parkinsonian state, severe headaches, and deep pains in limbs. Another old study (Mahal et al., 1976) found positive effects of brahmyadi yoga wit hout antipsychotics compared with placebo and equal to chlorpromazin in 136 patients with schizophrenia (Mahal et al., 1976); no adverse effects were reported. Four (from six) more recent studies found significant effects on general psychopa-thology when adding ayurvedic herbs (reserpine: one one study [Mundewadi et al., 2008]; a mixture of 13 Chinese herbs: two studies [Chen et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2009]) to antipsychotics. The ayurvedic herbs were compared with 10 mg of olanzapine in a 76-week noninferiority study in 200 patients. No statistically signifi- cant differences were found between both groups examining improve- ment of positive and negative symptoms and general psychopathology.The ayurvedic group had less weight gain (Mundewadi et al., 2008). Two large studies by Chen et al. (2008a, 2008b, 2009) of a mixture of 13 Chinese herbs found an improvement on general psychopathology.When kidney yang was added to risperidone, an improvement on cogni-tive and depressive symptoms was found in one study (from two) (Chen et al., 2008a, 2009). One study found no effect of the Chinese herb sarsasapogenin compared with placebo when added to risperidone onpositive, negative, and cognitive symptoms or general psychopathologyin 90 patients during 8 weeks (Xiao et al., 2011). Many different nonsevere adverse effects were reported ( e.g., gastrointestinal, drowsi- ness, and insomnia).(iv) B Vitamins Nineteen RCTs on B vitamins added to antipsychotics (Ananth et al., 1972, 1973; Deutsch et al., et al., 1990; Hillet al., 2011; Joshi, 1982; Kline et al., 1967; Lerner et al., 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007; Levine et al., 2006; McGrath et al., 1972; Meltzer et al., 1969; Miodownik et al., 2006; Petrie al., 1981; Ramsay Roffman et 2013; Sacks al., 1973)and one on B3 without antipsychotics (Greenbaum 1970) were found. B1 showed some positive effect on general psychopathology (when combined with B6 and B12) in one study (Joshi, 1982) and on positiveand negative symptoms in another (Sacks et al., 1989). B3 showed im- proved general psychopathology in three (from nine) studies (Ananth et al., 1972, 1973; Petrie et al., 1981). B6 improved general psychopa-thology in four (from five) studies (Ananth et al., 1973; Lerner et al.,2004; Miodownik et al., 2006; Petrie et al., 1981). In one study, general psychopathology improved after the administration of methylfolate (Godfrey et al., 1990). One study reported no effect of B9 (folic acid)(Hill et al., 2011). Another study showed a positive effect of combinedB6, B9, and B12 on positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms (Levine et al., 2006). Y et, another study showed improved negative symptoms by adding B9 (folic acid) and B12 to antipsychotics, butonly in those a specific genotype (Roffman et al., 2013). B6 im- proved extrapyramidal of antipsychotics (TD and neuro- leptic induced akathisia) in four (from four) studies (Lerner et al., 2001,2002, 2004, 2007; Miodownik et al., 2006). In one study on B3 in 57children without antipsychotics, cognition and general psychopathol- ogy had not improved after 6 months (Greenbaum, 1970). Most B vita- mins induced modest adverse effects, especially skin flushing andabnormal liver function induced by vitamin B3 and B6. (v) Antioxidants Two RCTs on vitamin C were found (Bhavani et al., 1962; D akhale et al., 2005). One reported improved general psychopathology and re-duced adverse effects (reduced serum malondialdehyde; a lipid peroxida-tion product) when added to olanzapine (10 mg), quetiapine (200 mg), or ziprasidone (40 mg) after 8 weeks (Dakhale et al., 2005). One study with- out antipsychotics found no effect on cognition or motor functioningafter 10 days (Bhavani et al., 1962). Both studies reported no adverse effects of vitamin C. Four studies on ginkgo biloba were found (Zhang et al., 2001a, 2001b, 2006, 2011b; Zhou et al., 1999). Three (from four)studies found improved positive symptoms (Zhang et al., 2001a, 2001b, 2006, 2011b; Zhou et al., 1999), two (from three) found im- proved general psychopathology (Zhang et al., 2001a; Zhou et al.,1999), and four (from four) reported no improvement of negative symp-toms when added to antipsychotics (Zhang et al., 2001a, 2001b, 2006, 2011a; Zhou et al., 1999). In all four studies, adverse effects of antipsy- chotics improved (behavioral toxicity, symtoms of nervous system, andTD). No adverse effects of ginkgo were reported. Thirteen studies of vitamin E were found (Adler et al., 1993, 1999; Akhtar et al., 1993; Dabiri et al., 1997a,1997b; Egan et al., 1992; 2009; Schmidt et al., 1991; Shriqui et al., 1992). Six (from 13) studies for reducing EPSs, while using anti- psychotics, showed a decrease of TD (Adler et al., 1993; Akhtar et al.,1993; Dabiri et al., Elkashef 1990; Lohrand Caligiuri 1996) and EPS (one study; Elkashef et al., 1990), and those with shorter duration of TD seemed to improve more; no adverse effects of vitamin E were reported, except mild diarrhea in two studies. Five(from f ive) reported no effect on general psychopathology (Adler et al., 1999; Dorevitch et al., 1997a; Elkashef al., 1990; Lam et al., 1994; Lohr and Caligiuri, 1996). One study of melatonin for TD reported a decrease of TD and no adverse effects (Shamir et al., 2001).Hoenders et al.

All rights reserved.(vi) Other Substances Agents that did not fit in the five aforementioned categories were classified in this residual category. A total of 16 high-quality RCTs havebeen performed on multivitamins (Altman et al., 1973; 2010), protilerin hormone) (Prange, 1979), testosterone (Ko et al., 2008), inositol (Levine et al., 1994), gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; Levy et al., 1983; Schulzet al., 1981) and des-tyr-gamma-endorphin (Verhoeven et al., 1979). Two (from five) studies on DHEA added to antipsychotics showed improvement of negative symptoms (Ritsner et al., 2006; Strous et al.,2003), two (from three) on positive symptoms (Ritsner, 2010; Ritsneret al., 2006), one (from three) on cognition (Ritsner et al., 2006), two (from two) on depression (Ritsner et al., 2006; Strous et al., 2003), and one (from four) on general functioning (Strous et al., 2003). Three (fromfour) improved adverse effects of drugs (Nachshoni et al., 2005; Ritsner,2010; Strous et al., 2007). In one study of 30 patients with schizophrenia, using either 5 g of 1% testosterone gel or a placebo added to a fixed dos- age of antipsychotic medication over a period of 4 weeks, negative symp-toms improved without adverse effects (Ko et al., 2008). One (from one) small study ( N= 12) on protilerin found improved general psychopathol- ogy (Prange, 1979). Three (from three) studies on estradiol showedimprovement of general psychopathology (Akhondzadeh et al.,2003; Kulkarni et al., 2008, 2011), two (from three) of positive symptoms (Akhondzadeh et al., 2003; Kulkarni et al., 2008), one (from one) of improved cognition (Kulkarni et al., 2008), and none (from three) ofnegative symptoms. One (from one) small study ( N= 14) on inositol found no effect on positive or negative symptoms (Levine et al., 1994). Two (from two) studies on GHB found no improvement of general psychopathology(Levy et al., 1983; Schulz et al., 1981). One (from one) very small(N= 6) study on des-tyr-gamma-endorphin found improvement on gen- eral psychopathology and positive symptoms (Verhoeven et al., 1979). No serious adverse effects of these agents were reported. One study (of two) on artemisinin (a natural medicine against malaria) found a significant effect on negative symptoms and clinical global impression, but no effect on positive or cognitive symptomsor on general psychopathology in first-episode treatment-naivepatients that were treated with risperidone (Dickerson et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014). The study of Dickerson et al. (2011) did not demonstrate clinical benefit of adjunctive artemisinin forschizophrenia symptoms. DISCUSSION This review describes the effects of natural agents in the treat- ment of psychotic disorders and of undesired effects of antipsychotics. Some studies suggest that glycine, sarcosine, NAC, several Chinese andayurvedic herbs, ginkgo biloba, estradiol, and vitamin B6 may be effec-tive for psychotic symptoms when added to antipsychotics (glycine not when added to clozapine). We found inconclusive or no evidence for omega-3 fatty acids, D-serine, D-alanine, with- out antipsychotics seemed effective in one old study but was poorlytolerated. Ayurvedic herbs seemed equally effective as olanzapine inonly one study. Other agents as monotherapy (vitamin B3, vitamin C, sarcosine, glycine, and protilerin) were not effective or had only been tested in single or small trials. For alleviation of adverse effects, ginkgoand vitamin B6 seemed effective for TD and neuroleptic inducedakathisia (NIA). The evidence for reducing some adverse effects of antipsychotics by omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, and DHEA was inconclusive.Apart from reserpine, all natural compounds studied caused no or mild undesired adverse effects. There is inconclusive evidence for im-proved outcome by combining omega- 3 fatty acids with antipsychotics in schizophrenia. Earlier reviews reported similar conclusions (Boskovic et al., 2011; Irving et al., 2006; Tsalamanios et al., 2006). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo controlled trails showed a modest, non-significant, beneficial effect of fatty acids in schizophrenia (Fusar-Poli and Berger, 2012). Glycine and sarcosine combined with antipsychotics may reduce negative symptoms, but not when combined with clozapine and neitheras monotherapy. Inconclusive evidence was found for D-cycloserine andD-serine on clinical improvement. Our results concur with two reviews (Singh and Singh, 2011; Tsai and Lin, 2010) and are in line with aCochrane review (Tiihonen and Wahlbeck, 2006). Conflicting results from studies on drugs targeting the glut amate/NMDA system may be explained by complicated dose-effect relationships, as recently found in studies withthe GlyT -1 transporter antagonist bitopertin (Umbricht et al., 2013). adding Chinese or ayurvedic herbs to antipsychotics, general psychopathology may improve. One study (of two) on artemisinin (a natural medicine ag ainst malaria) found a signifi- cant effect on negative symptoms and clinical global impression,but no effect on positive or cognitive symptoms or on general psy- chopathology in first-episode tr eatment-naive patients who were treated with risperidone (Wang et al., 2014; Dickerson et al.,2011). The study of Dickerson et al. (2011) did not demonstrateclinical benefit of adjunctive ar temisinin for s chizophrenia symp- toms. Rathbone et al. (2007) state that \"the results suggest that combining Chinese herbal medicine with antipsychotics is benefi-cial.\"Another Cochrane review (Agarwal et al., 2007) concludes that\"ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pio-neering trials. \"These results need further exploration and pharma- cological differentation, as Chi nese and ayurvedic herbs include hundreds of species combined in thousands of different combina- tions and are prescribed in a fundamentally different way thanWestern medicines (Clifford, 1994; Kaptchuck, 2000). The com-bined approach using knowledge from both conventional and Chinese medicine seems promis ing, as it may lead to innovation ( V a nd e rG r e e f ,2 0 1 1 )a n dp o s s i b l yt oi m p r o v e do u t c o m e s( Z h a n get al., 2011b). Inconsistent beneficial outcomes of studies on B vitamins were identified, especially when given as a combination of B1, B3, B6, B9,and/or B12 with antipsychotics. One review concluded that no adequatesupport for the efficacy of B vitamins in schizophrenia can be identified (Kleijnen and Knipschild, 1991). Most studies with positive effects in our review, however, were published after the aforementioned reviewwas published. Most convincing evidence was found for vitamin B6added to antipsychotics, shown to be effective in diminishing general psychopathology and TD. The findings on the efficacy of vitamin C for schizophrenia in only two RCTs were inconsistent, hindering definite conclusions. The efficacy of vitamin E on TD remains inconclusive, as only half of the included studies found some positive results. Even so, a meta-analysisby Boskovic et al. (2011) claimed, \"Vitamin E could potentially improve TD.\"This may be due to the finding that those with a short history of TD tend to improve more than those with a longer history of TD. A Cochrane review in 2011 (Soares et al., 2011) came to a similar conclusion:\"small trials of limited quality suggest that vitamin E may protect against deterioration of TD. There is no evidence that vitamin E improves symp- toms of this problematic and disfiguring condition once established. \" Ginkgo biloba seems to benefit patients with schizophrenia in several ways when added to antipsychotics. Several studies sug-gested evidence for improving symptoms in various domains, espe- cially an effect on positive symptoms and the reduction of adverse effects of antipsychotics.The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease \u0081Volume 206, Number 2, February 2018 Natural Medicines for Psychosis \u00a9 2018 W olters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. www.jonmd.com 95On melatonin, one study provided preliminary evidence for diminishing TD (Shamir et al., 2001). As TD is difficult to investigate be-cause of the fluctuating symptom severity, this study needs replication. Some inconsistent evidence was found on improved outcomes by several hormones (DHEA, PREG, and testosterone) in schizophre-nia, not allowing final conclusions. A Cochrane review on DHEA/testosterone drew a similar conclusion (Elias and Kumar, 2007). For es- tradiol, a Cochrane review reported no convincing evidence over pla- cebo (Chua et al., 2005). Since then, two studies found that estradiolimproves positive (but not negative) symptoms and general psychopa-thology in schizophrenia when added to antipsychotics (Kulkarni et al., 2008, 2011), however only in women of childbearing age. There- fore, using estradiol in schizophrenia warrants further study. Limitations There are several methodological limitations. First, the wide scope of this review allows only general descriptions of included stud- ies in six domains. Second, it is unclear to which extent our findings are influenced by publication bias, in favor of publication of studies withpositive results. Third, we used the Jadad score to select only RCTs of high quality (with a score of three or higher, as is in accordance with other reviews [ e.g., see Thirthalli et al., 2016]). However, the Jadad score is not a perfect tool because it does not judge the selection of sub-jects, the sample size and power, and the quality of the data analyses. Therefore, RCTs with a Jadad score of 3 or higher might still have methodological weaknesses, which hamper drawing firm conclu-sions. Fourth, some studies ( e.g., Bhavani et al., 1962; Greenbaum 1970; Naidoo, 1956) were done in the pre -Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-3 ) era, when standards of care and diagnostics may have been of lower quality than nowadays,which hampers interpretation of their results. Fifth, in most of the stud-ies included, effect sizes were not provided nor was it possible to calcu- late them, which makes it difficult to compare the results or to estimate the clinical relevance of some of the findings. Sixth, it cannot be ruledout that some of the studies were underpowered, which might have hampered finding a significant effect. Clinical Implications Clinicians need to be aware that patients often use natural medi- cines without medical prescription, whereas some patients assume thatnatural is better than chemical and causes fewer adverse effects. Al- though beneficial effects may occur, this is certainly not always true. Some natural agents that may be suggested for treatment of psychoticdisorders are toxic to humans (Topliss et al., 2002), and some herbalmedicines can cause adverse effects or interact with medication (Ernst, 2003b). Only 3% of the user population is aware of the potential risks of interactions between herbs and prescription medication (Walterand Rey, 1999). From a medical perspective, it is therefore important toknow what patients buy and try. Another concern are the media reports on contamination of Chinese herbs with heavy metals. However, after investigation of 334 samples, Harris et al. (2011) conclude that \"the vast majority (95%) of medications in this study contained levels of heavy metals or pesticides that would be of negligible concern. \"Because of these concerns, patients want their medical doctors to advise them oncomplementary (or natural) medicines (Gray et al., 1998; Hoenderset al., 2006). The World Health Organization (2013) has repeatedly ad- vised its member states to \"formulate national policy and regulation for the proper use of CAM and its integration into national health care sys-tems; establish regulatory mechanisms to control the safety and qualityof products and of CAM practice; create awareness about safe and ef- fective CAM therapies among the public and consumers \"and\"promote therapeutically sound use of appropriate Traditional Medicine bypractitioners and consumers. \"Respecting patients' opinions and informing them may also improve the therapeutic relationship (Stevinson, 2001) andthus enhance treatment outcome (Gill, 2013; Koenig, 2000), which de- pends on the quality of the therapeutic alliance (Baldwin et al., 2007). This review gives clinicians and patients an overview of the re- sults of RCTs, which fit a minimal level of quality (minimum Jadadscore of 3), on the efficacy and safety of natural medicines for psychotic disorders. However, many questions about clinical use ( e.g.,d o s a g e , safety, interactions, and quality) remain unanswered.
